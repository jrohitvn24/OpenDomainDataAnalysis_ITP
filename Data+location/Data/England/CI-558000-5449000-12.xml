		<content>       KATHRYN'S HOUSE                 
           BY GILLIAN HOUGH            
  The site on which Kathryn's house    
 was built, was originally the sand    
 dunes. It was built up into quite a   
 large extensive estate, about nine    
 years ago. It has over fifty          
 modernized four bedroomed houses and  
 all of them have a front and back     
 garden. The garden soil is not very   
 good to plant in because the soil is  
 so sandy that it is virtually         
 impossible to plant anything there.   
 Also, some of the houses on the estate
 have problems with crumbling          
 foundations due to the sand that      
 subsides, and dampness. The estate    
 is in quiet surroundings and the speed
 limit has just been reduced to twenty 
 miles per hour to make it safe for    
 children to play in the streets.
