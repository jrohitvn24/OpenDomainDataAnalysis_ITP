		<title>06The Sidmouth Herald.</title>
		<content>  A survey was conducted on Sidmouth's 
 own newspaper,{The Sidmouth Herald,   
 which is published every Saturday. A  
 number of people were asked their     
 views on the newspaper and on{The     
{Midweek Herald,}which is a free       
 newspaper.                            
  The majority of people liked the     
 contents of The Sidmouth Herald and   
 thought it a good local newspaper. A  
 smaller number preferred The          
 Midweek Herald.                       
  When we interviewed the Editor of The
 Sidmouth Herald, we found that the    
 Newspaper was{founded in 1849;}that it
 takes a full seven days to put it     
 together and that it is{printed in    
{Bristol.                              
  The Herald employs 16 people on a    
 full-time basis and 6 part-time.      
  The{circulation is approximately     
{7,000.                                </content>
