		<title>14Roman Roads, Hailey.</title>
		<content>Three Roman Roads cross our area. The  
most important and interesting one is  
Akeman Street, running from southwest  
to northeast, joining the forts of St. 
Albans (Verillanium) and Cirencester   
(Corinium).                            
At New Found Out Farm there is a Roman 
cross road where Whiteway (St.John's   
Path) and Pay Lane meet Akeman Street. 
If you follow Whiteway to the south    
east you can still see some rounded    
Roman cobble stones, set on edge, which
could lead to an old villa, though no  
trace remains.                         
Pay Lane leads to the northwest, to-   
wards Greenwitch Lane, near Brizes     
Lodge Farm, where Roman pottery has    
been discovered.  All these roads are  
now bridleway except the narrow tarred 
Akeman Street between New Foun Out     
Farm and Ramsden.
