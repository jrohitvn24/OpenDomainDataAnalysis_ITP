		<title>18HOCKWELL RING DAY CENTRE</title>
		<content> This is a{day centre}for old          
 people.There was an old lady who was  
 a{hundred years old!}She was sitting  
 on a settee all crouched up.The old   
 people think youths are getting spoilt
 by their parents.The area is a quiet  
 place.The houses are detached and some
 of them are bungalows.In other parts  
 of Hockwell Ring,there are also a lot 
 of very tall flats and lots of Council
 houses.There are some shops,a Club    
 and a Pub.The Day Centre is 10 years  
 old.People mostly{walk}there because  
 they live next to the Centre.Some come
 by{ambulance.}They like coming here   
 because they can get to know each     
 other better.When it was time to go,  
 the Manager gave us all a Lime        
 drink.It was refreshing!I enjoyed     
 that!
