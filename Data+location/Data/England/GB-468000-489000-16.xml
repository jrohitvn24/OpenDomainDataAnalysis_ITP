		<title>16Village Life in Gillamoor</title>
		<content>                                       
 Gillamoor is still a working village, 
 with farms and a small primary school.
 It has a post-office but no grocer's  
 shop and relies on Kirkbymoorside     
 shops.There is a craft and coffee shop
 There are about 100 people living in  
 the village, some 50% being retired.  
 Until about 10 years ago,most families
 had continuously lived in the village,
 but now about half are'incomers'and   
 only 10% speak with a local accent.   
 There are 5 or 6 farming families here
 but others work out of the village.   
 Most people enjoy a quiet country life
 tending their small-holdings and well 
 maintained gardens. Some keep a few   
 hens,a goat,a pig or bees. There is a 
 village carnival in August and the    
 ladies support a thriving WI.The      
 'Royal Oak' pub has recently been     
 modernised, but is still the "local". </content>
