		<title>16AN AVERAGE DAY OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> This is an account of a day by a 9    
 year old girl living in Longborough:  
 "My favourite day is Monday because I 
 see all my friends at school again.I  
 get up at 6 a.m. to play with my      
 hamster.For breakfast I have rice     
 crispies.I walk across the road to    
 school.It starts at 9 a.m. when the   
 bell is rung.After assembly we do     
 language &amp; reading skills.In the      
 afternoon we have mathematics &amp;       
 science followed by games with Swell  
 School.After school I have an early   
 tea because I go to Brownies in Stow  
 with my friend &amp; her mum.My dad brings
 us back.At Brownies we play games like
 Cuthbert's Cow &amp; Giant's Garden.We do 
 painting &amp; sometimes we do gardening  
 at Stow Church.We also go to parades. 
 We have to work hard to earn our      
 badges.When I get home I go to bed."
