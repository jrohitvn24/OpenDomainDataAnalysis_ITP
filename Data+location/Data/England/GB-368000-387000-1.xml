		<content> Lying in North Cheshire and nearly    
 midway between Liverpool and          
 Manchester, Lymm is bounded by the    
{Ship Canal}to the North and the       
{Bridgewater Canal}to the South.       
 Following the Second World War,Lymm's 
 fields became ever more rapidly       
 covered with private housing estates  
 intended for the car-owning commuter, 
 and the arrival of the Motorway       
 crossroads added to the pressure.     
 Strict planning restrictions in the   
 Green Belt and Conservation Areas are 
 limiting the building of new houses,  
 and warehousing and haulage industries
 for which Lymm is so attractive a site
 have been kept at bay.A more recent   
 and less welcome trend is for the     
 smaller shops in the village to be    
 replaced by offices.The Parish Council
 have now a Retail Trading Policy.
