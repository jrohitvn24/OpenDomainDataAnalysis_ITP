		<content>{Willesden Sports Centre}is a          
 developing concern. At present, it    
 consists of baths with facilities for 
 indoor or outdoor swimming and diving.
 There is a stadium which has just had 
 a new omniturf surface laid in        
 preparation for the{1986 World Hockey 
{Championships.}It is also used        
 throughout the year by clubs and      
 schools. Coaching is given for many   
 sports during term time and special   
 holiday sessions are provided. In the 
 summer months the stadium is used for 
 a display of country dancing given by 
 many Junior schools from the borough. 
 At present, a new development is      
 underway which will provide squash    
 courts for the centre.The small       
 gymnasium offers a chance for Keep-fit
 sessions for those who wish to shed   
 those extra pounds.
