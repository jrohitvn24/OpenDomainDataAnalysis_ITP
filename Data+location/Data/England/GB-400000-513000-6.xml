		<content>  In autumn the farming year starts    
 with harvesting the barley and storing
 it in a large barn.We cut hedges for  
 people who plant winter barley.Then   
 the barley fields are ploughed for the
 frost to break down the soil.         
  The cattle are brought into sheds for
 winter and fed on silage.Hay is fed to
 the sheep if the snow is deep (which  
 often happens in this area).We have 22
 cows and 70 sheep (ewes).             
  In spring the ewes have their lambs, 
 increasing our stock to about 140.Our 
 ram is a Suffolk.Manure is spread on  
 the fields along with fertilizer to   
 improve the soil.                     
  In summer we employ 2 extra people(We
 employ only 1 permanent person during 
 the year) to help with the hay.For the
 silage a forage harvester picks up the
 grass,chops it and transfers it to    
 trailers to be led to the farm.       </content>
