		<title>08FACILITIES AT THE HOSPITAL.</title>
		<content>      The hospital will have three     
 wards with a total of 72 beds.        
 Provision has been made in the        
 planning for the building of a fourth 
 ward if that should become necessary. 
 There is also to be a day unit which  
 will have 40 places.                  
      It is expected that the majority 
 of patients will be elderly although  
 it will be possible for minor,        
 non-surgical patients to be treated   
 here instead of at the large hospital 
 five miles away. These patients will  
 be under the care of their local G.P. 
 instead of a hospital doctor.         
      There will be no Accident and    
 Emergency Unit, all urgent cases being
 dealt with at the Chesterfield Royal  
 Hospital as before.
