		<title>07Warkton, Kettering.</title>
		<content>  From the A43(T) road there is a      
wonderful view of the village of       
Warkton set well above the valley of   
the River Ise just 2 miles north-east  
of Kettering.                          
  It is a beautiful place surrounded by
meadowland with sheep and dairy cattle 
often present.                         
  Many trees are evident which enhance 
the area enormously.  On the ridge     
above the village an avenue of lime    
trees leads towards Boughton House.    
  The stone cottages are mostly        
thatched or have Collyweston tile      
roofs; many have small latticed windows
and some have strengthening bolts,     
plates and girders.                    
   There are a few 20th. century       
buildings which blend well into the    
local scene.  Rigorous planning        
requirements have demanded that they   
too should be of stone.                </content>
