		<title>12The use of modern appliances</title>
		<content>   We found that nearly everyone had a 
 telephone and television. Most people 
 had washing machines and a large      
 minority had a tumble drier. Nearly   
 everyone had a freezer because they   
 shopped one a week. Without a freezer,
 people would either have to buy more  
 from the mobile shops, or travel more 
 often. As 87% of the adults work,     
 tumble driers and washing machine     
 would be essential. Only a small      
 minority of people own computers,     
 although more posess video recorders  
 and microwave ovens.                  
   It would seem that the villagers use
 the wonders of modern science to      
 improve the quality of their lives.
