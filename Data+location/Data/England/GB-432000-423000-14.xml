		<content> FOR OVER A CENTURY THIS HAS BEEN A    
 COAL MINING AREA.IT IS HONEYCOMBED    
 WITH GALLERIES,MANY UNCHARTED AND     
 BARELY SUB SURFACE,AND DOTTED WITH    
 DISUSED SLAG HEAPS,MOSTLY GRASSED     
 OVER.THE LAST WORKING PIT WAS         
 LOFTHOUSE,CLOSED IN 1982.SUBSIDENCE IS
 WIDESPREAD,CAUSING WALLS TO CRACK AND 
 ROADS TO UNDULATE.TWELVE YEARS AGO THE
 SCHOOL DRIVE COLLAPSED INTO A GALLERY 
 ONLY 2 METERS BELOW THE SURFACE.      
 INTERNAL DOORS NEEDED REFITTING AND   
 CRACKS APPEARED IN THE CORRIDOR.NEW   
 HOUSES ARE BUILT ON A CONCRETE "RAFT" 
 WHILE LOW-LYING LAND NEAR THE RIVER   
 WHICH WAS SHEEP PASTURE LAST CENTURY  
 IS NOW SWAMP.WHERE DAMAGE TO PROPERTY 
 IS ATTRIBUTED TO MINING THE COST OF   
 REPAIRS IS MET BY THE N.C.B. MINING IS
 NOT CARRIED OUT UNDER HISTORICAL SITES
