		<title>08History in Farcet</title>
		<content> We walked round{Farcet}with a lady who
 had lived there all her life. She     
 showed us an estate of houses where   
 there had been farm land and a{Manor  
{House.}The house was knocked down in  
 1618. The old{River Nene}used to flow 
 near{Farcet.}The new course of the    
 river was made in 1900. The old river 
 is called the{Pig Water.}The old      
 village was grouped around the church.
 There was a pond which has now been   
 filled in. There was a big fire in    
 1921 and water from the pond was used 
 to put it out. Many of the houses were
 built around 1900 when many people    
 came to work in the brick yards. The  
 first school was built in 1848. Now   
 there is a new school and the old     
 school is used for business premises.
