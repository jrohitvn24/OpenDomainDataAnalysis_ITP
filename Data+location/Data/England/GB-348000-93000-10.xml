		<content> Mappercombe Manor is surrounded by    
 buildings and fields and is owned at  
 the moment by{Admiral Sir V.A.        
{Crutchley V.C.}It's roughly 2km from  
 Loders and you can get a good view    
 from the old railway.                 
 The Manor was built on a 'Monastic    
 Road' as a rest house, unfortunately  
 the age is not known. There are two   
 chapels on the Manor, one is now a    
 cider house the other is  a dressing  
 room. The Manor was enlarged in the   
 early 20th century. In the garden     
 there is a pump dated 1907, there is  
 also a sundial dated around the same  
 time. The pump collects water from the
 Manor's gutters which is then used to 
 water the huge garden which contains a
 large fig tree. In one part of the    
 garden there is a swimming pool on the
 site of a monk's fish pool which is   
 filled by a natural spring!           </content>
