		<title>10Filey's Edwardian Festival.</title>
		<content>   The idea of having a festival to    
 increase the tourist trade of Filey   
 began in 1980 when the church of      
 Saint Oswald had its Octo Centenary.  
 The following year it was decided it  
 should be an Edwardian Festival       
 because the buildings on the front    
 were mainly Edwardian.                
   Local traders and people in Filey   
 dress in Edwardian costumes throughout
 the week. Several traders attempt to  
 give their shops an Edwardian flavour.
   There are over ninety events which  
 take place during the week.It begins  
 with a craft market held in the Town  
 Hall gardens. Local school gymnasts,  
 choirs and bands entertain the public.
  There are art,craft and photographic{
 exhibitions and displays by local     
 organisations.Each evening a different
 band and the Fishermen's choir        
 entertain people in the bandstand.    </content>
