 Hanslope school is 17 years old.      
The first school was built in 1968     
and the middle school was built in     
1974.                                  
At school we have break time, it starts
at quarter to eleven and finishes at   
eleven, and an hour later we have      
dinner time. We've got lots of work    
to do, some times we stay in at break  
time if we haven't done enough work.   
We do study on Tuesdays and Fridays. We
are at school for 6 hours from 9:00    
to 3:05.                               
There are some clubs after school.     
I'm going to athletics.                
So is my brother.My Mum picks us up    
from school.
