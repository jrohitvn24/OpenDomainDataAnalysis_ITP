		<title>14ROMAN MILESTONE</title>
		<content> In 1771 workmen digging for gravel    
 discovered an extremely well preserved
{Roman milestone}.It was found 2 miles 
 from Leicester,close to the old Roman 
 FosseWay,on land which is now occupied
 by Rushey Mead Secondary School.      
 The inscription on the milestone tells
 us that it was erected in A.D.120     
 during the reign of Emperor Hadrian   
 Augustus.It provides the earliest     
 evidence of the Roman name for        
 Leicester,Ratae Coritanorum.          
 After its discovery the milestone     
 narrowly escaped being used as a      
 garden roller.In 1783 it was set up by
 the Corporation in Belgrave Gate as   
 the base for a lamp standard.The lamp 
 was replaced by a cross in 1824 when  
 the milestone was painted.In 1849 it  
 was transferred to the Town Museum and
 is now prominently displayed in the   
 Jewry Wall Museum,Leicester.          </content>
