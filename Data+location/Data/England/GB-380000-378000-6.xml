  The rules for{Blocky Off}are like    
 those for Hide and Seek.Someone is    
 'on' and he counts to 100 standing by 
 a post or a tree while everybody      
 hides.When he can't find them they    
 must try to run back to the post and  
 shout"1 2 3{Blocky Off!"}If he sees   
 them they must try to reach the post  
 before he catches them .The game is   
 over when either everyone has been    
 caught or has reached the post safely.
