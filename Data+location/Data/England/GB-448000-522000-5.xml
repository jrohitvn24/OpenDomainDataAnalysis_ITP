		<title>05THE BUTCHER'S SHOP</title>
		<content> The butcher's shop has been in the    
 Clarke family for three generations   
 but was probably a cobbler's before   
 that.                                 
  It was situated at the bottom of a   
 long street with houses and shops on  
 both sides rising up the hill in{     
{Haverton}towards{Cowpen Bewley.}      
  Now the shop stands alone with a     
 vacant space beside it used as a car  
 park for the butcher's van and his    
 faithful customers who travel in from 
 Cowpen and Billingham etc..           
  The area is deteriorating all the    
 time and the fight against the        
 inevitable vandals makes life very    
 difficult.The proprietor thinks that  
 another five years should see the end 
 of the area altogether.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
