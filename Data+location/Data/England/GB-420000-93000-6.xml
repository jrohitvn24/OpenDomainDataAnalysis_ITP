		<title>06 ARNEWOOD SPORTS CENTRE</title>
		<content>   Many people swim at the indoor      
 heated swimming pool at Arnewood. Lots
 more people go there for the other    
 facilities: mothers  take their young 
 children for tiny tots' recreation on 
 Mondays and many people go there for  
 squash. There is a  gymnastics club   
 and also a trampolining  course held  
 for young people. This year the sports
 centre has given out many certificates
 to children and adults who have taken 
 swimming courses and swum so many     
 metres. On  certain days at different 
 times the pool is only open to        
 disabled people. For those who can not
 enter the water on their own there is 
 a hoist to lift them in and out. This 
 year the Manager is Dave Jenkins and  
 his Assistant Managers are Val Workman
 and Rosemary Bartlett.
