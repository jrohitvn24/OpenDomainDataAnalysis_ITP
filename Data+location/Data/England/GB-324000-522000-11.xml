 The Reminder started in 1896. There is
 one machine which makes the words.It  
 has upper case, lower case and        
 punctuation marks.These are made of   
 hot metal die-casts.The big letters   
 are put into words by hand.Next they  
 are placed in a flattish box which is 
 put into a machine and printed onto   
 paper.They employ 16 people,3 of whom 
 are half time.                        
   In the town of Keswick there are    
 nine shops that sell The Reminder.They
 are also sent by post to Braithwaite, 
 Threlkeld and Rosthwaite.Altogether   
 there are 17 shops that sell the      
 paper.The Reminder was free until 1942
 but has now been icreased to 10p.The  
 workers work 37 and a half hours each 
 week making 4000-4300 copies.
