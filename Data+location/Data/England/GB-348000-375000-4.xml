 FARMING                               
 There are many farms in the area which
 have mainly mixed farming in some     
 form.We visited Mr.Williams of        
 Netherton Farm. He owns 540 acres.This
 year his main crop is Barley but he   
 also has grass and potatoes for silage
 and grazing.He has over 200 bullocks  
 for beef and over 1100 pigs for bacon 
 and saugage.Mr.Roylance's Mickledale  
 Farm also has Barley as his main crop 
 and like Mr Williams he grows potatoes
 and grass for silage and grazing.He   
 grows Rape as well.Rape looks like    
 cabbage but has bright yellow         
 flowers.It is used as a drought feed  
 in summer.He has 55 milking cows,23   
 heifers,25 calves and 20 hens.He has  
 12 cats for catching mice.
