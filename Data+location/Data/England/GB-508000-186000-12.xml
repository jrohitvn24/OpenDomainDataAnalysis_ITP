		<content>   Most of the people who own or manage
 shops in Ruislip Manor do not live in 
 the area, but travel in from other    
 areas. 80% of all the managers had not
 been in their present job for more    
 than 8 months. Only 12 of the shops   
 are owned by a larger chain or        
 corporation. None of the shops have   
 been handed down from one generation  
 to the next. Apart from food shops    
 ladies hairdressers were plentiful,   
 with 5 salons in one short stretch.   
 The owners/managers of the salons said
 that there was no shortage of clients.
   The library is one of the largest   
 buildings in Ruislip Manor, and has so
 far survived attempts by the council  
 to close it to save money. The local  
 people protested at this proposal and 
 organised a successful petition. There
 is little doubt that Ruislip Manor is 
 in a continuous state of change.      </content>
