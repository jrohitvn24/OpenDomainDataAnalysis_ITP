		<title>17Local Transport</title>
		<content>For transport to our local shops my Mum
uses her car or walks. If we want a    
days shopping in Wolverhampton or      
Birmingham we take Dad's car. There is 
no passenger train service in          
Hednesford so we always travel by car  
when visiting friends and relations.   
When we go to London we go by car to   
Stafford and then go by train. My      
friends and I use our bikes to go      
visiting each other. Hednesford        
station used to be open to passengers, 
but now it is used for transporting    
coal during the week, and special      
excursions some weekends in summer.    
There is a very good local bus service 
provided by four companies. Buses to   
Cannock and Rugeley run about every    
half hour, and to Birmingham and       
Wolverhampton every hour. 60% of our   
class own a car, 17% own two cars,and  
23% do not own a car.                  </content>
