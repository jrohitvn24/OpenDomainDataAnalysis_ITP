		<title>20      LOCAL COMMENT</title>
		<content> Local residents were asked to comment 
 on the amenities in the area and to   
 suggest{improvements.}On the negative 
 side most people feel the decline of  
 public transport in recent years is   
 appalling,making life difficult for   
 the old and those without cars.       
 Transport to schools is also poor.    
 Shops are inadequate,non-existent in  
 Radnage,and prices are high because of
 lack of competition.Concern is also   
 felt over main road speed limits,     
 inadequate policing,refuse facilities 
 and decline in local industry.Too much
 horse culture is leading to a         
 deterioration of grazing meadows.     
 On a more positive note,most people   
 enjoy living in the area because of   
 its{relative tranquillity}and are keen
 to help in the conservation of the    
 countryside.                          
                                       </content>
