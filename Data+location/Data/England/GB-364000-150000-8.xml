		<content>  My name is Toby and I live on a farm 
 near school.We own fifty acres and    
 another fifty acres are rented.It is  
 not far from the{Fosseway}and until   
 1984 was a typical family dairy.We had
 about 75 Fresian cows and thirty young
 stock as replacements for the cows.In 
 1980 my Dad started growing{potatoes  
 and now ten acres are used for this   
 vegetable, enough to supply four local
 shops, a grocery van and a milk       
 roundsman.In 1984 after two very dry  
 summers, the dairy cows were sold and 
 now only the fifty home acres are     
 farmed.{Silage}is made from all the   
 land down to grass, and is fed to     
 approximately sixty cows that are kept
 in yards all the year round.These cows
 have been sold to us from other farms 
 because they are unsuitable for milk  
 prodution and we fatten them up for   
 meat production.                      </content>
