		<content> a) What were the houses like in those 
 days we asked Mrs. Smith?             
 Similar, the windows were smaller to  
 keep the warmth in.Many houses had    
 outside toilets.Some had no bathroom. 
 In the kitchen they had a big fire    
 with a cupboard stocked with coal     
 which was used for cooking and heating
 but the fire was generally kept alight
 all year round.They had coppers to    
 boil things in.For clothes there was a
 big mangel,it was a huge thing and you
 had to turn a great big handle which  
 turned two big rillers.               
 b)What kind of clothes did you wear?  
 when I was a little girl thing had    
 just changed just before my time it   
 was more modern when I was a little   
 girl we wore white pinafores over     
 dresses like starched ones and        
 generally had boots on our feet.
