 with crops other than grass. The      
 secondary land cover is residential,  
 mainly houses, with one, small, all   
 purpose shop in West Street. There are
 a few fields of fertilised grass for  
 silage. Odiham Firs is on the A32,    
 Alton-Reading road. It is 400 feet    
 above sea level. The Firs were planted
 to commemorate the lighting of the    
 beacon at the time of the Spanish     
 Armada. In 1977, a beacon was lit to  
 celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Queen 
 Elizabeth the Second.                 
 The main residential area is around   
 the Recreation Ground, opposite to the
 Robert May's secondary school.There   
 are some private houses at the Firs.  
 Nearby are the married-quarters for   
 service personel, stationed at R.A.F  
 Odiham. Hart District Council owns the
 housing estate opposite to the school.</content>
