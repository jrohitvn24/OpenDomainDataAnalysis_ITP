		<title>06Farming Newton/Dunham area</title>
		<content> The Trent Basin comsists of a variety 
 of soils suitable for most types of   
 farming and this area is no exception.
 Here can be found most arable crops   
 and most types of livestock. Crops    
 grown include wheat, oats, barley,oil 
 seed rape. Sugar beet, potatoes and   
 carrots. Livestock reared are most    
 commonly beef cattle then  sheep pigs 
 and dairy cows. There is also a       
 chicken farm at North Clifton. There  
 are fifteen farms in all:five at      
 Newton, three at North Clifton, three 
 at Ragnall. two at Dunham and two at  
 Fledborough. Of these five are arable 
 two are livestock and the remaining   
 eight are mixed. Newton situated on   
 slightly higher ground is better      
 drained and suited to sheep rearing   
 whilst the cattle farms are generally 
 on the lusher West Bank of the Trent.
