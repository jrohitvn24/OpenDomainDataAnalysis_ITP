I AM 13 YEARS OF AGE AND I ATTEND      
CHURNET VIEW MIDDLE SCHOOL, LEEK. MY   
DAY BEGINS WITH THE FAMILY GETTING UP. 
MY FATHER GETS UP FIRST AND HE GOES OUT
TO WORK AT SIX-THIRTY, MY MOTHER,      
SISTER AND I GET UP AROUND             
SEVEN-THIRTY.   WE HAVE BREAKFAST AND I
LEAVE FOR SCHOOL AT EIGHT-FIFTEEN. I   
USUALLY WALK TO SCHOOL ALTHOUGH IT IS  
QUITE A GOOD WAY AWAY.  AT SCHOOL WE   
HAVE FOUR LESSONS A DAY, ON WEDNESDAY I
HAVE FRENCH, GEOGRAPHY OR COMPUTER     
APPRECIATION, HISTORY AND GAMES. WE    
HAVE LUNCH FROM TWELVE O'CLOCK UNTIL   
ONE-FIFTEEN.  SCHOOL FINISHES AT       
THREE-FORTYFIVE AND I ARRIVE HOME AT   
QUARTER PAST FOUR.  IF I HAVE ANY      
HOMEWORK I DO IT AS SOON AS I GET HOME.
OUR FAMILY HAS TEA AT AROUND SIX-THIRTY
WHEN EVERYONE IS AT HOME. I WATCH SOME 
TELEVISION AND THEN GO TO BED AT TEN.  </content>
