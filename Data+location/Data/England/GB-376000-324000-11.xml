		<content> The houses in this area vary in age.  
 There are a number of houses built in 
 the early nineteenth century . A      
 number of cottages were built in the  
 early twentieth century, and then very
 little building was done until the    
 nineteen sixties.                     
 In the mid-sixties a speculative      
 builder purchased a market garden,    
 a poultry farm and a gravel pit in    
 Woodseaves.  He built eighty  houses  
 which are known as Glebefields and    
 Barn Common. At the same time old     
 peoples' bungalows were built on High 
 Offley Road, and some Council         
 houses were built on Dicky's Lane,also
 in Woodseaves.                        
 The only new building which is allowed
 at present is 'infilling' in gaps     
 between existing properties. There    
 is to be no further building in the   
 village until l994.                   </content>
