		<title>02THE HISTORY OF SEVERN STOKE</title>
		<content>    In the twelfth century, the banks  
 of the River Severn in this area were 
 used as a{vineyard.}This practice     
 continued for a hundred years until a 
 disastrous flood in 1371. In the      
 fourteenth century a group of the     
 local Manor Lords led by{Robert de    
{Brunswock}rose against the Earl of    
 Coventry heralding fifty years of     
 bloodshed.                            
    In the civil war the priest of     
 Severn Stoke,{John Somers,}was shot   
 dead in his pulpit (and the bullet    
 holes can still be seen today!).      
    Severn Stoke was the birthplace of 
 a working class movement called the   
{"Levellers"}in 1671. They were        
 described as "A band of rogues who did
 many deeds of villainry in the        
 country".Many of their principles were
 subsequently overtaken by the Quakers.
