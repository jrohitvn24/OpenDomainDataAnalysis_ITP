		<title>02EMPLOYMENT IN FELMINGHAM</title>
		<content> Mainly an agricultural area, the      
 village of Felmingham spreads over the
 B1145 road from North Walsham to      
 Aylsham. The surrounding area is      
 mainly arable farming; both large land
 owners and smallholders. There are    
 small industrial companies, light     
 engineering and contract cleaners.    
 several crafts exist including a      
 pottery.                              
 The popolation is drawn from all over 
 the country; about half being locally 
 born, the rest moving into the village
 to work at the Oil and Gas Sites at   
 Bacton or at RAF Coltishall; or to    
 retire to the country from London or  
 the Midlands.                         
 There is very little unemployment in  
 the area, although it is necessary to 
 travel to North Walsham or Norwich for
 work.                                 
                                       </content>
