		<content> Home life of Rachel Would.            
   Hello, I'm called Rachel Would.I    
 have a very enjoyable day. First of   
 all I get dressed and eat my breakfast
 of cornflakes and toast. Next I put my
 coat on and go to school. At school   
 there is sometimes Assembly. At       
 Assembly we sing hymns and Praise God.
 During the morning we sometimes watch 
 Televison, do English or Maths. We    
 also do a piece of work were you write
 stories.I love doing that.When we have
 finished we go home for dinner or stay
 at school.Every Thursday we have      
 P.E.,and we go to the next school at  
 Aldbrough.After P.E. we do Singing    
 Together from the radio.Then we all go
 home from shool at half past three.
