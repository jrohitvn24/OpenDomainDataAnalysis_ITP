		<title>13INTERVIEW WITH MRS. HONESS</title>
		<content>{Mrs Honess told me}there used to be a,
  coal yard &amp; there used to be a fun   
 fair every year at Cox's yard until   
 the houses were built.There used to be
 a sweet shop by the railway.Alot of   
 the woodlands have been ploughed up.  
 You had to walk everywhere if you had 
 no bicycle. There were hardly any cars
 so if you had a bicycle you had to    
 make do with it. A majority of people 
 used horse &amp; cart.Horses used to come 
 on the trains to the races,because    
 there were no lorries.There was no    
 milkman so people had to get their    
 milk from the creamary which was by   
 the railway station. There was once a 
 breeze block factory but now it is    
 closed.In March 1983,Prince Charles   
 visited Plumpton race course &amp; rode a 
 horse in one of the races. Since 1965 
 more houses have been built but the   
 public transport has lessened.        </content>
