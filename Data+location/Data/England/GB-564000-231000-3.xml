		<content> The names of Great and Little Sampford
 derive from old English words meaning 
 'a sandy ford'.They were once 'Old'   
 and 'New' Sampford.The ford across the
 River Pant still exists by-passed by a
 road and bridge.Bardfield is difficult
 to interpret but is probrably derived 
 from an old English word,the element  
 'bard' meaning 'open land colonised by
 dependant peasants'.The element       
 'field' is common in this part of     
 Essex and self-explanitory.It occurs  
 also in Finchingfield which means the 
 'open land of the people of Finc'.The 
 latter is a personal name presumably  
 of a local leader.                    
   The River Pant that, with its minor 
 tributaries,links the whole area has a
 name of Celtic derivation which is    
 rare in Essex.It means'valley river'  
 which is consistent with local        
 geography.                            </content>
