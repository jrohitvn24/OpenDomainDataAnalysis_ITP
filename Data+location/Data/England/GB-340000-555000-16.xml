		<title>16Carlisle Public Baths</title>
		<content>  The Baths are in James Street, though
 the larger secondary schools also have
 swimming pools. The Family Pool is 0.9
 metres deep at the shallow end and 1.6
 at the deep end; the adjacent "baby"  
 pool is 0.75m deep. On the other side 
 of the building the "big" pool's      
 depths are 0.9m and 2.0m. The Baths   
 are open daily from 9.00am till 9.00pm
 except Thursday and Saturday (9-5) and
 Sunday (10-12).                       
 The equivalent of three-quarters of   
 Carlisle's population swim here each  
 year. As you pay (60p adults, 30p     
 children and OAPs) you are given a    
 coloured band. When a light of that   
 colour flashes after about an hour you
 must leave the water.Chlorine is      
 added each morning to kill germs.     
 There are five life-guards on duty. A 
 cafeteria next to the spectator area  
 serves snacks.                        </content>
