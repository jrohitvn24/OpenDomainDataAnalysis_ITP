		<title>06THE C18 ROAD</title>
		<content> The C18 road runs N out of Petersfield
 towards Winchester.Built,1820's by    
 Moses Hoper,landlord,after he got Govt
 go ahead to set up a turnpike (private
 road trust). The present route winds  
 up Stoner Hill.It enabled stagecoaches
 to avoid the old &amp; very steep climb   
 that the original,mediaeval,route from
 Steep to W'chester entailed if they   
 were to avoid the village of Stroud (a
 stroud was saxon for boggy land) which
 lay between P'field and W'chester to  
 the W.The C18 is the subject of local 
 protest as juggernauts are doing much 
 damage and  are lethal traffic hazard.
 Locals have asked the Hants CC to put 
 weight &amp; width restrictions on C18.   
 Highways Dept say this is impossible,&amp;
 suggest that answer is to re-route    
 traffic by altering signposts.Locals  
 are are not satisfed.They say route is
 too well established for this to work.</content>
