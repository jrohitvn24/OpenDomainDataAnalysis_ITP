		<content>{Foods bought from shops.}             
                                       
 Most food is home grown,in rural      
 areas like{Chilsworthy,}but people    
 still need shops.                     
                                       
 The sort of thing you might find in   
 these small village shops are sausages
 bacon,meat,fruit and vegetables.These 
 small  shops can all be put into one, 
 called a "General Stores".This        
 consists of one smallish shop which is
 a post office,sweet-shop,grocers,green
 -grocers and tobacconists.            
                                       
 Most families take a trip into town   
 (in this case Holsworthy) and they buy
 everything thing they need.Orange     
 squash and other drinks may be bought 
 from these "General Stores".Most      
 people prefer home grown meals.
