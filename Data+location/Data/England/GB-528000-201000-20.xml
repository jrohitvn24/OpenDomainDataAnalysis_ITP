		<title>20OUR CONCLUSIONS ON CUFFLEY.</title>
		<content> After working  for four months on this
 Domesday Project we have found out    
 lots of new and interesting facts     
 about our village and the surrounding 
 area. We have enjoyed doing the work  
 and hope that it will benefit many    
 people in the years ahead.Our         
 conclusion is that we all think it is 
 a good place to live and we are glad  
 that we live here!                    
  Classes One and Two have all         
 contributed to the work in here but
