		<title>14Cabbage Growing</title>
		<content> Charleston Farm is the only farm round
 about here that grows cabbages. They  
 put three seeds in a clump so they    
 know that one will grow. As they grow 
 bigger they take the spare plants out.
 When they are ready they cut them.    
 Then they are drenched in special     
 chemicals. Then they are put into big 
 boxes and taken to the cold store and 
 a fork lift truck has to take them    
 there because men couldn't carry the  
 heavy boxes. The cabbages they grow   
 are called Dutch White and they store 
 them for 8 months and they sell them  
 to supermarkets for vegetables and    
 coleslaw. They can store 2000 tons of 
 cabbages on the farm.
