		<title>17Population in rural Sowerby</title>
		<content>    The population is a scattered      
 working population, and as such tends 
 to be under 60 years old. When farmers
 reach retiring age or there abouts,   
 they tend to move out of thefarm      
 houses into less isolated homes in    
 near by villages,leaving the farm     
 house for the eldest son and his      
 family.                               
     Many of the farms and "tied"      
 cottages have school age children and 
 primary aged children go to local     
 village schools. The older children go
 to the comprehensive school at Thirsk.
     Generally speaking, farmers and   
 farm workers get on very well         
 together,though socially farmers mix  
 with farmers and farm workers with    
 other workers.
