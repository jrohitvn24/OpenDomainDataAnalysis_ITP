		<content>Mohammed aged eight :-  My favourite   
place is a camp. It is dark and scary. 
Outside it is cold. I like my camp and 
it's got butterflies , caterpillars and
bumble bees and grasshoppers. Everyday 
I go with my friend. We buy sweets and 
crisps and lollipops to have a party in
the camp. The camp is in Hessel Street 
and smells like fish.                  
                                       
Sarmine  aged nine :-  My favourite    
place is school. When it is dinner     
time the school smells nice. Everyday  
it smells of fish and chips. When it   
is quiet I think I'm in the sky, in    
the clouds. But when it's noisy it     
feels like I'm with a lot of monsters. 
                                       
Gous aged nine :-  My favourite place  
is a factory where there is a postbox  
and we play the letter game there.
