		<title>13The Timber Industry</title>
		<content> Mr Michael Watts is a timber merchant 
 who has his business in Dunston. He   
 employs six people and has been in the
 business since 1950. He owns sixty    
 acres of land but it is impossible to 
 say how many trees there are. He      
 plants 4000 Christmas trees per acre, 
 1500 deciduous trees per acre, and    
 2000 poplar trees per acre. The age at
 which the tree is felled depends upon 
 the type of tree. Christmas trees are 
 felled at between 4 and 7 years old;  
 oaks are not felled until they are    
 60-100 years old. The average height  
 of a felled tree is 75 feet. 80% of   
 the timber is used for pit props in   
 mines and the other 20% is used for   
 fencing.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
