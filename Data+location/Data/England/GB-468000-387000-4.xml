		<content> The Bible College, which belongs to   
 the Assemblies of God, is sited in    
 Mattersey Hall which stands on the    
 eastern edge of the village. The      
 oldest section of the Hall is 400     
 years old and is used by the students 
 as a laundry area. The panelled dining
 room, built after 1918 by Sir Stuart  
 Goodwin is now a lecture room. the    
 Hall itself has changed from being a  
 private residence, a boys Prep School 
 and finally in 1973 the Bible College.
 It houses approximately 70 students   
 from all over the world. Their fees   
 are paid by the Assemblies of God     
 Churches and other donations. At the  
 present time two new blocks are being 
 built. This will mean an increase in  
 the number of residential students.   
 Some married students with familites  
 stay in rented accommodation in the   
 surrounding district.                 </content>
