		<title>09R.A.F. LINK WITH LUDFORD</title>
		<content> In 1943 an airfield was built at      
 Ludford _ home of 101 Squadron's Lanc_
 _aster Bombers. Today few buildings   
 left but corn is a different green    
 where runways were. Still strong link 
 with 101 _ Memorial stands in main    
 street and reunion held in September. 
 Today ladies who as girls served the  
 Airmen in Village Canteen, continue to
 serve &amp; provide grand tea at reunion, 
 contributing much to an event which   
 attracts members from Australia, New  
 Zealand, Canada &amp; S.Africa. In the    
 Church is the Association Standard and
 Book of Remembrance with the names of 
 1100 young men, the highest casualties
 of any RAF Squadron due to 101's      
 Special Operations role.Today only the
 roar of Lightning Jet Fighters from   
 nearby RAF Binbrook which patrol the  
 N.Sea to intercept Russian planes     
 (Bears) probing our airspace.         </content>
