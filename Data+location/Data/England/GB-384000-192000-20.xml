		<title>20Education in Beverstone.</title>
		<content> There are now no educational          
 establishments left in the Beverstone 
 area.The village school has been      
 closed but it can still be seen as a  
 private house on the south side of the
 A.4135 at grid.ref.859939.A curious   
 feature near the school is the large  
 sunken area which runs alongside the  
 road.This was originally part of the  
 outer moat of the castle.
