		<content> We are going to celebrate by doing a  
 play in the cathedral called          
 Dr.Faustus.The Cathedral dates from   
 672 when a Saxon church was built.All 
 that remains of that church is the    
 crypt.The Cathedral was completed in  
 the fifteenth century.                
   In Ripon there is a traditional     
 Hornblower.At 9:00 P.M every night the
 Hornblower blows the horn on all four 
 corners of the Obelisk.               
   Around Ripon there are a lot of     
 small villages and tourist attractions
 eg. Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal.
 Both of these are close to each other.
 Studley Royal is a deer and wildlife  
 park and Fountains Abbey is an        
 interesting place to walk around.
