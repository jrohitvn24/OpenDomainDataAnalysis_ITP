		<content>   I get up at 7 o'clock every morning.
 I am the first to wash.  My mum goes  
 to work at the same time as we go to  
 school, and my dad leaves just after  
 us.  On Saturdays I get up later than 
 usual and get woken by my mum yelling 
 up the stairs!  My mum and dad are in 
 their 30's but act as if they were 20.
 My dad buys 'trendy' trousers and     
 shirts to our approval.  My mum is    
 trendy too. sarah, my sister, bosses  
 me around a bit and we are always     
 arguing.  I have a cat, Poppy, and    
 some frogs.  Sarah and I spend        
 Saturday mornings down town wasting   
 our money.  Both my sister and I are  
 mad on Wham! and spend hours arguing  
 about who has the most posters.       
   I love my family and would never    
 change them.
