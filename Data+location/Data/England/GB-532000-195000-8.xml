		<title>08Gentleman's Row</title>
		<content> Gentleman's Row is famous for its     
 collection of old houses. These houses
 date back to Victorian times. There is
 a wide road separating the houses from
 their gardens. This allowed coaches to
 drop their occupants outside their    
 houses.                               
                                       
 One of the houses contains part of    
{Enfield Palace}which stood where      
 Pearson's store stands today. This    
 house contains some of the dark oak   
 panelling and chimney piece.          
                                       
 The most famous inhabitant of         
 Gentleman's Row was{Charles Lamb}Both 
 he and his sister Mary frequently     
 visited a friend in Enfield and stayed
 at Elm House. Charles Lamb then took  
 up residence at Clarendon Cottage.    
 The whole of Gentleman's row still    
 stands today.                         </content>
