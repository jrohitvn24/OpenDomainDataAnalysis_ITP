		<content>{Lover}Post Office is quite near the   
 school.Every year,for{St Valentine's  
 Day,Mrs Southorn prints a special     
 frank mark on 800 to 9oo Valentine    
 cards.She does not frank letters on   
 other days.They go to Salisbury       
 sorting office. This year the frank   
 mark had two doves with hearts and the
 word{Lover}underneath.Mrs Southorn had
 the idea of using the frank mark when 
 the Post Office issued a stamp with a 
 heart on it.                          
             The sign outside the post 
 office is a red heart with the word   
{Lover}on it.                          
             The post office has a shop
 with it.You can buy{Lover}souvenirs   
 such as loving cups.It also sells all 
 sorts of things which mothers run out 
 of but sweets sell faster than        
 anything.
