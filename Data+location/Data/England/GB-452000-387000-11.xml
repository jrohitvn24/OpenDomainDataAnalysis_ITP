		<title>11A Typical School Day</title>
		<content> The school opens at 9.0 o'clock. We   
 all rush through the doors as usual.  
 Then we all go into our classroom and 
 get out our spelling books, jotters,  
 pens, pencils and reading books. Then 
 we start to do the number square and  
 the sentences from the board. After   
 that we might go swimming to          
 Dinnington Baths. We go on a coach. On
 the way there we pass some interesting
 things. For example we pass a wall    
 which is eroding and the stones are   
 all funny shapes and sizes. Another   
 thing is that we can see the fields   
 shining in the morning sunshine. At   
 the swimming baths we all have to do  
 what Mr Brain says. We usually start  
 by doing a few lengths using our own  
 choice of stroke. After swimming we   
 come back and it is playtime. At      
 playtime all the boys out of class 6  
 and 7 play football.                  </content>
