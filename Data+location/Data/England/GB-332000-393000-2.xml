		<content>   In our area there is quite a lot of 
 older{housing.}Most of our class{(76%)
 live in terraced houses. These were   
 built in the{19th. Century.}Most of   
 these houses have been done up with   
 new bathrooms and central heating.    
 There are also some large detached and
 semi-detached villas near our school. 
 These were built in about{1740.}      
 Merchants used to live here.          
    {"OUR STREET" by Lee Hunter(11yrs.)
 Our street has got houses             
 It has got flats                      
 And the houses have rats              
 We climb up the trees                 
 And get stung by bumble bees          
 Our Street is a funny street.         
 The shops the pubs and all the school 
 And we even include some swimming     
 pools,                                
 The scrap yard and railways too       
 Our Street is just right for you.     </content>
