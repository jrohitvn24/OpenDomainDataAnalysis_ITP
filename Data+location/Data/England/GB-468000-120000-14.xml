		<content> No main roads pass through this area  
 and the 2'B'roads linking East Meon   
 with Langrish &amp; the A272 joining      
 Petersfield &amp; Winchester &amp; also to    
 Hambledon &amp; other villages to the     
 south are confined to the north &amp; west
 portions of the area.These roads are  
 narrow,with room for only one lane of 
 traffic in each direction.The twisting
 country lanes with theit high hedge-  
 rows which criss cross the rest of the
 area are usually only wide enough for 
 one vehicle.This causes problems when 
 for instance farm machinery or hay    
 lorries are using the roads.The       
 village of East Meon has an additional
 problem:its narrow main street has    
 double yellow lines to prevent people 
 parking on them &amp; causing traffic     
 jams,yet it has no car park. This     
 inconveniences both locals &amp; visitors 
 alike.                                </content>
