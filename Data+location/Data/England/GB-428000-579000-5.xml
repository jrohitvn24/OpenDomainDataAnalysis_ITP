		<title>05GOLF COURSE AT NEW DELAVAL</title>
		<content>   An eighteen hole golf course was    
 opened at New Delaval in 1976. There  
 are 700 playing members and the annual
 subscription is Â£88 for men and Â£65   
 for women. The course was built on the
 derelict industrial site of the New   
 Delaval Colliery(sunk in 1859, closed 
 1958).                                
  The only visible evidence of its     
 previous use is an electricity        
 substation and the pit shaft which    
 houses pumps to prevent Bates Colliery
 workings from flooding. To preserve a 
 link with the past, holes on the golf 
 course have been given names which    
 relate to the old colliery village and
 the pit.:_
