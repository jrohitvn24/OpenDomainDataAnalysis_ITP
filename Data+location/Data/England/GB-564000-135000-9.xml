		<title>09   Hops in Lamberhurst</title>
		<content>    The importance of{hops}can be      
 traced to the last century when in    
 1894 a part of the parish of          
 Lamberhurst in Sussex, voted to join  
 Kent because the price paid for hops  
 was always higher. Hops are perenials,
 and the dark purple shoots can be seen
 coming through the earth in March.    
 Then farm_workers start{stringing,}   
 which means they use a long pole to   
 put string from the screw_pegs in     
 the ground to the wire work, which is 
 about 15 feet above. In April and May 
 workers train the hops around the     
 string in a clockwise direction. This 
 is often called {hop_twiddling.}In    
 June,{heading }is carried out. This   
 means twisting any loose hop heads    
 round the strings. At the end of July 
 the  hops are in flower which is      
 called a{burr.}After 3 weeks, the burr
 turns into a soft, cone shaped fruit. </content>
