 UNTIL RECENTLY OUTWOOD WAS IN THE     
 CENTRE OF THE MAIN AREA IN ENGLAND FOR
 THE PRODUCTION OF RHUBARB.   WHOLE    
 FIELDS WERE TO BE SEEN GROWING NOTHING
 ELSE.   IN THESE FIELDS COULD BE SEEN 
 LONG LOW SHEDS WHICH WERE USED FOR    
 'FORCING' THE CROP, QUICKENING THE    
 GROWING PROCESS AND GETTING IT READY  
 FOR THE MARKET.   TRAINS WOULD LEAVE  
 LOCAL STATIONS EACH DAY TAKING THE    
 PRODUCT DOWN TO COVENT GARDEN MARKET  
 IN LONDON.   SOME WAS EVEN SENT FOR   
 EXPORT.                               
 PRODUCTION IS NOW DECLINING AND THE   
 FIELDS ARE TURNED OVER TO HOUSING     
 DEVELOPMENT, OR IN OUR IMMEDIATE      
 LOCALITY, BUILDING A LIGHT INDUSTRIAL 
 ESTATE FOR SUCH THINGS AS WAREHOUSING 
 AND DISTRIBUTION, OR COMPUTER PARTS.
