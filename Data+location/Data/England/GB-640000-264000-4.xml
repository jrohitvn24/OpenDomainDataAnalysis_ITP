		<content> Bird life abounds, small birds at home
 in woods and near houses, hovering    
 kestrels and large barn owls at dusk. 
 Sea gulls follow the tractor and      
 lapwings flock in winter. In the lanes
 spring brings a bounty of primroses,  
 cowslips, then alexanders, cowparsley 
 soon made bright by poppies, daisies, 
 comfrey, yarrow, ragwort and willow   
 herb in the drainage trenches.        
 Glimpses of deer can be caught in the 
 dark woods but there in spring,       
 besides the pens for hand reared      
 pheasants, is a carpet of purple      
 orchids. White posts enclose parts of 
 verge where a rarer plant is growing  
 telling the hedge cutter that it is a 
 protected species and must not be cut.
 Sometimes stoats streak across the    
 roads but in late springsome roads are
 covered in young frogs seeking new    
 ponds. There are hares and rabbits.   </content>
