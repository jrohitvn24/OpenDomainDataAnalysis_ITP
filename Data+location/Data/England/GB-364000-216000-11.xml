		<title>11PLUMP HILL, MITCHELDEAN</title>
		<content>    Until 1984, the scattered hillside 
 settlement at Plump Hill, about one   
 mile south of Mitcheldean had its own 
 small Primary School. In July of that 
 year the school closed due to the     
 number of pupils having fallen to a   
 very low level. The buildings were    
 however in good condition, and after  
 much discussion it was agreed to allow
 the Wilderness Field Study Centre to  
 take them over as an additional       
 department for day visits for a trial 
 period. The school is situated at the 
 end of a narrow lane, on the edge of  
 open country, with a wealth of        
 environments in the nearby woods and  
 hillsides. So successful has the      
 centre proved with its heavy bookings 
 by school parties, that it has been   
 agreed to continue its use in 1985/86,
 and hopefully beyond.
