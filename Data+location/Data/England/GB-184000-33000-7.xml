		<content> One of the sailing clubs is St.Mawes, 
 and offers temporary membership to    
 visiting yachtsmen and their families.
 They have at present a fairly small   
 clubhouse,but are about to have a     
 large one erected.The other club is at
 Percuil and this offers a similar     
 membershipto visitors,with races      
 regularly throughout the season and   
 tuition to beginners.                 
 Although windsurfing is carried out at
 St.Mawes,it is far more popular in the
 waters around Portscatho,as the coast 
 here is more open and therefore winds 
 are stronger,giving windsurfers       
 conditions which are better suited to 
 their sport.At Portscatho there is    
 also a windsurfing school operating   
 from Portcurnick Beach where tuition  
 is given or boards may be hired.
