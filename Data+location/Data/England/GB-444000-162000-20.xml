		<title>20Holidays in Wash Common</title>
		<content> In the lower three classes of the     
 juniors caravanning seemed to be the  
 most popular holiday and most people  
 camped abroad. 18 people were staying 
 with relatives or freinds and 15      
 people were staying in hotels and 14  
 in self catering flats or villas, 23  
 people stayed in this country and 9   
 are going to France, 4 to Spain and 3 
 to Germany. We asked the teachers     
 where they are going. 4 teachers are  
 going abroad - 1 to Israel,1 to       
 Germany and France and the other 2 are
 going to Greece and Portugal. The     
 techers staying in this country are   
 spread out from Scotland to Devon, the
 Lake District to Dorset. The three    
 dinner ladies are going to Devon, St. 
 Davids and the coast. I think that    
 holidays will change in 50 years, and 
 may even be on the moon.
