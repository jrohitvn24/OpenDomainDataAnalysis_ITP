		<title>01THE DUNSMORE AREA</title>
		<content> The Chiltern Ridge, South of the      
 Icknield Way, between Wendover and    
 Ellesbrough is a sparsely populated   
 area on the edge of the north         
 escarpment of th Chiltern Hills with  
 chalk uplands rising to 800ft, capped 
 by gault and divided by deep, dry     
 valleys, running north/south. The     
 whole area is criss_crossed by public 
 footpaths, including the Ridgeway and 
 much used by hikers. The Northern and 
 Western parts largely belong to the   
 National Trust or the Trustees of the 
 Chequers' Estate. The only population 
 is Dunsmore, a hamlet of approximately
 90 inhabitants, which has to use all  
 the amenities of Wendover 4kms away.  
 The eastern edge of the grid is       
 traversed north/south by the A413     
 from Amersham to Aylesbury and the    
 railway from Marylebone to Aylesbury.
