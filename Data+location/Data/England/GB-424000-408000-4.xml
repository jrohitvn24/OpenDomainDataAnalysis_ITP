		<content> Over the last 70 years Scissett has   
 changed completely. Going down the    
 main road these are the main          
 changes...                            
   There was a chemist where the       
 Phoenix Textiles showroom is. There   
 was a draper's and milliners where the
 bank was.The boutique "Bacall" was    
 called "Barous,Draper's and Grocers   
 and Corn Merchants". A row of 28      
 houses became the Clinic and          
 Doctor's. The building which was Fine 
 Design, was a CO-OP and previously the
 infant school.The CO-OP was originally
 beside the pelican crossing with      
 missionary buildings on the top floor.
 This is now a block of flats.The flats
 behind were open fields and a dam was 
 built there.The wool shop Jean's - was
 a tailors shop.The newsagents was a   
 Conservative Club.
