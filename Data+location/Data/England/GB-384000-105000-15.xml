		<title>15The Bryanston Estate Club</title>
		<content>   The Club is open seven days a week. 
 There are two bars, one for adults,the
 other for junior members. A live show,
 barbecue or disco is held fortnightly.
   There are Inter Club tournaments in 
 all games. At present the Club has 7  
 skittles teams, 3 or 4 darts teams, 2 
 shove ha'penny teams,pool and cribbage
 teams.There is a ladies netball team. 
   Young and old alike are involved in 
 these activities &amp; no single age group
 is specially catered for. Weekly bingo
 sessions and whist drives are more    
 appealing to older members.           
   Although priority is given to the   
 village, the Club boasts members "from
 practically all over the world." Cheap
 subscriptions are given to those in   
 the area only temporarily. The Club is
 used by the Dorset Darts Association &amp;
