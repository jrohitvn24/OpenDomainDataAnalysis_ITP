		<title>13Hutton Industrial Estate</title>
		<content> None of the factories in Hutton       
 Industrial Estate are older than      
 twenty five years.Transport           
 nowadays is a lot easier because of   
 the Dartford Tunnel,and the M25       
 and an airport which makes it quicker 
 to travel from one place to another.  
 Some of the different factories in    
 Hutton are a yoghurt factory,a        
 packaging factory and also light      
 engineering.The estate is in a semi-  
 rural area.From the windows of the    
 factories green fields can be         
 seen.There was a fire at a packaging  
 factory in Hutton and police were     
 worried that people would be harmed   
 by toxic fumes caused by burning      
 plastics.Fire engines had to come and 
 fight the fire with hoses.
