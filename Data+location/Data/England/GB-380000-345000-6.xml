		<title>06Mining in Silverdale</title>
		<content>The 4 shafts at Silverdale Colliery are
well over 100 years old,but mining has 
been going on in the area for more than
200 years.The earliest evidence of mine
workings in Silverdale was the finding 
of fossils in the coah shales by Sir   
Robert Eggerton in 1763.Coal was mined 
in Silverdale in 1830 to provide fuel  
for the iron works.There has been only 
one major disaster at Silverdale,when  
19 men were killed in a gas explosion  
underground.A unique feature of today's
pit is the water purification plant    
which treats polluted water and makes  
clean water at a rate of 400 gallons a 
minute.In May 1976,the National Coal   
Board approved a scheme costing twenty 
million pounds to sink a new mine at   
Silverdale which will last for the next
50 years.860 men work at Silverdale pit
many of them live in the village.They  
start work at 16 and retire at 60 or 65</content>
