		<title>20THE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> Near the village pond is an old       
 stone-built building. Originally it   
 was the workhouse where, in the       
 eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,  
 penniless and homeless people were    
 housed. Now it is a meeting place for 
 the many activities that take place in
 the village. A jumble sale, a whist   
 drive or a disco all take place here. 
 On Thursday evenings the Brownies use 
 it as a base for their activities. It 
 is here that a painting class is held 
 and when the Summer Flower is held at 
 the end of June, the scent of sweet   
 peas and roses is wonderful.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
