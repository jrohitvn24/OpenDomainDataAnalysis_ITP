		<title>02ARTS &amp; CRAFTS IN POYNTINGTON</title>
		<content> In the last three years local women   
 and some men have given their time and
 skill working{Tapestry}Kneelers as a  
 practical yet attractive enrichment   
 for their churches.They are worked    
 in  various  designs  but  with  a    
 predominant  blue  backround  at      
 Poyntington.{Patchwork}and Home Dress_
 making classes arranged by the Women's
 Institute have taught these skills to 
 quite a lot of ladies and some lovely 
 quilts and cushions have been created.
 Two artists enjoy{painting}in a semi_ 
 professional way and an Exhibition of 
 Local Arts &amp; Crafts is staged at the  
 Poyntington Festivals and sometimes at
 W.I. meetings. Knitting for Oxfam or  
 family needs is a winter occupation   
 for some ladies while men use their   
 own grapes or hedgerow fruits and     
 flowers to make wine,often with       
 excellent results.                    </content>
