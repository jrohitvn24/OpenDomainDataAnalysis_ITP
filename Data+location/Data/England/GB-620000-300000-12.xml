		<title>12The River Tas</title>
		<content> The River Tas is a small stream which 
 has a valley much noted for its beauty
 and as a home for wild-life.          
 The 16 miles of the river are very    
 popular for all kinds of leisure and  
 relaxation.                           
 There used to be otters but they,     
 along                                 
 with other species, have sadly died   
 out.                                  
 There are some public paths where you 
 can fish, birdwatch and admire the    
 beauties of the countryside. Some of  
 the banks are privately owned.        
 Along the side of the bank there is   
 the site of a Roman slaughter house,  
 where you can hunt for pottery, animal
 bones and other Roman relics.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
