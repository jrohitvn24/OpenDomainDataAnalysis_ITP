		<title>04THE WAY WE ARE IN ABERDEEN.</title>
		<content>  Fashions are similar to other        
 areas.Fashions change seasonally and  
 yearly.Flares,donkey-jackets,wedge    
 shoes and bowl hair-cuts are OUT.     
  The pop groups we like are also much 
 the same. We all like the type of     
 groups that get to number 1 in the    
 record charts.The main things pop reco
 rds have in common is a good rhythm,  
 a good tune and good words that fit in
 with the tune.                        
  Children enjoy playing games and     
 watcing T.V. Parents usually read the 
 paper or watch T.V.or go out to a     
 club,dance,cinema,pub,restaurant or to
 friends.At weekends families go for a 
 run in the car,watch sports,go        
 shopping,help in the house and relax. 
  People eat the same foods as we do   
 but,we eat different things every day.
 On Sundays we have a special three-   
 course meal of chicken or roast beef. </content>
