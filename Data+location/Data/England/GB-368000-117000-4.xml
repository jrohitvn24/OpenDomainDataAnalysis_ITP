		<content>  As in the case of many rural areas   
  there is very little in the way of   
  entertaiment provided for the        
  population.As a result there are a lo
  of clubs in the area,most of them    
  concerned with sport but even these  
  provide social events as well as     
  sporting fixtures.                   
  There are oportunities to play cricke
  ,football,Badminton,skittles,darts,ar
  hery,swimming and netball.Also there 
  are discussion groups,the Womens     
  Institute the British Legion,the     
  Historical Association,the Arts      
  Group,the Pantomine,Society and the  
  Bingo club as well as societies      
  belonging to the churches.           
  There is very little in the way of   
  adult educetion so people go to Yeovi
  or Wincanton to attend evening       
  classes.                             
                                       </content>
