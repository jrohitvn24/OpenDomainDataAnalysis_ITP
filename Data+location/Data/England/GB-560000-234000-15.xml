		<title>15THE SAMPFORDS AIRFIELD</title>
		<content> This airfield was used in world war   
 two.It was linked with another one in 
 Debden.The runway is about one third  
 of a mile long.It is thought to be    
 linked with the wreck of a hurricane  
 found in Great Sampford in a field    
 .Lots of wreckage was found.Last year 
 the engine was found.The other plane  
 involved in the crash was found in    
 Hempstead wood.The planes at the      
 airfield mostly were hurricanes and   
 spitfires.Some of the planes have been
 donated to Duxford Airfield.A lot of  
 parachuting was done there for        
 practice. A lot of bullets have been  
 found up there and some of them are   
 alive.The Sampfords airfield is about 
 2 miles away from here.It is near     
 Tindon End.There is nothing left of   
 the airfield now.It is all used for   
 farm land.
