		<title>06HOUSING IN GOOLE</title>
		<content>  The{oldest housing}in Goole is about 
 150 years old, in the docks area. Few 
 are residential today but are business
 premises, some of which have flats    
 above.                                
  Housing from 1840 to 1890 is much    
 more evident, mostly still occupied.  
 These were built as{worker's}brick    
 terraces with grey slate roofs.       
  Much building took place from about  
 1880 to 1910 in the new{business      
 centre round the station.             
  Many{council houses,}both terraced   
 and semi-detached, were built between 
 1930 and 1960.                        
  More expensive,{private,}detached and
 semi-detached houses, built of brick  
 and pebble-dash, were erected between 
 1920 and 1950 on roads leading out of 
 town.                                 
  Modern{estates}and developments are  
 currently being planned and built.    </content>
