		<title>18       HOUSING : EAST SHEEN</title>
		<content>  To the north of the Upper Richmond   
 Road the houses were generally        
 terraced and quite small. They were   
 built between 1890 and 1910. They were
 also in a very variable state of      
 repair. Some had been refurbished,    
 others were poor and un-cared for.    
 There were few trees down the roads,  
 so they looked rather dull, and this  
 area was definitely less desirable.   
  South of the Upper Richmond Road the 
 houses were more modern, most         
 semi-detached. They were built in the 
 1930s, and all had large front and    
 back gardens.                         
  In the 1920s and 30s there was       
 a great expansion in housing, and more
 people wanted to live outside London, 
 so the population of East Sheen       
 increased accordingly.
