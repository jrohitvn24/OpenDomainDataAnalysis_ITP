		<title>15Farms in the Rolvenden Area</title>
		<content>  {Friezingham Farm} is a mixed farm of
 about 350 acres. Over half of this is 
 pasture (with some marsh) and there   
 are hop gardens, orchards (including a
 plum orchard) and arable (cereals).   
  {Fish farming}has recently been      
 introduced into the area. Using a wind
 pump, fresh water from Chalybeate     
 Spring is pumped into man-made fish   
 ponds along the banks of Newmill      
 Channel and crayfish are brought to   
 maturity there.                       
   Some children are lucky enough to   
 live on a farm.{Shane}describes the   
 year as he sees it:                   
  {The cows calf from September to May 
{usually. When calfing stops they stay 
{outdoors for an hour or two. On the   
{first day of June they start making   
{silage. In Autumn the cows come in    
{again. It's nice and warm in the      
{cowshed in the Winter and it smells." </content>
