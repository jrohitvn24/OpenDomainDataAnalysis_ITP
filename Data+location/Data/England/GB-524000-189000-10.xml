		<content> HGS was planned by Henrietta Barnett  
 and designed by Unwin and Lytens.It   
 was first owned by HENRY VIII,then by 
 Eton College who sold it to HB Trust. 
  HB believed that people should live  
 in a place of trees,grass &amp; greenery. 
 She also disliked alcohol and so there
 was to be no pub but  a tea-house.    
 The tea-house proved very popular &amp;   
 she therefore had a clubhouse built   
 for meetings,alas,during the SWW it   
 was hit by a bomb &amp; has not been      
 rebuilt.The tea-house was then forced 
 to close through lack of custom.      
 Houses in HGS are built in Tudor      
 style,with long sloping roofs &amp;       
 chimneys.The roofs are pointed &amp; very 
 varying window sizes.                 
 There are numerous hedges in the area 
 but they cannot be replaced by        
 fences,and doors in the area have to  
 conform to a colour scheme.           </content>
