		<content> There are two settlements within the  
 survey block, Buckden and Grafham. The
 undulating land between them is       
 devoted to arable  farming. The fields
 are hedged although some have been    
 joined. Primroses and cowslips grow   
 along the disused railwayline between 
 the two villages.                     
  Grafham, which gives its name to the 
 nearby resevoir is a small village    
 with only one shop and a public house.
 To the north of the village is        
 Brampton Wood, an MOD firing range.   
 Between the two villages are two or   
 three farms situated on the sides of  
 a shallow valley.                     
  The western edge of Buckden is       
 dominated by the noise and litter of  
 the A1 trunk road. We discovered      
 numerous tin cans as we walked along  
 it. The Ouse Valley to the east of the
 village is quarried for gravel.       </content>
