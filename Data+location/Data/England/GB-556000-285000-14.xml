		<content> There is a Health Centre in Granby    
 Street, where there is a practice of  
{doctors.}Serious cases are taken to   
 the RAF Hospital in Ely (5 miles) or  
 Addenbrookes in Cambridge (25 miles). 
 There is also a{dentist,}who sees 30  
 people per day, mainly doing fillings 
 although she says her hardest job is  
 to persuade people to clean their     
 teeth properly. Children in both      
 schools are visited by doctors,       
 dentists,{opticians}and have          
 vaccinations. Up to 100 people per day
 visit the{chemist,}most commonly for  
 colds and 'flu, but cosmetics are also
 sold as well as medicines.            
{In the past,}fen men drank opium or   
 poppyhead tea to keep off fever, wore 
 eelskin garters to avoid rheumatism,  
 put roasted onions in the ears against
 toothache and swallowed whole roast   
 mouse to cure smallpox.               </content>
