		<title>18Religious Controversies</title>
		<content> Currently controversial issues include
 the legalising of Sunday trading,     
 without the restrictions which apply  
 at present. Methodists are amongst    
 those who resist this. The ordination 
 of women is an emotive issue, it has  
 been accepted in principle by the     
 Church of England, but has not yet    
 been put into practice. Non-conformist
 Churches have already experienced this
 transformation. The role of the Church
 in the community has been under recent
 scrutiny, priests are involved in Age 
 Concern, Youth Clubs, Sport and the   
 County Council; the theology of the   
 priest appears secondary to their     
 activity in the community;but they are
 also prepared to speak out on matters 
 from Apartheid to Government Social   
 Policy. The future of the Church is in
 the ecumenical movement, but progress 
 is slow.                              </content>
