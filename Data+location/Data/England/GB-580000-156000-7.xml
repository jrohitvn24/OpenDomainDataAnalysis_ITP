		<title>07CONSERVATION - NORTH DOWNS</title>
		<content> This is an important issue. Permanent 
 damage to the landscape occurs as     
 housing covers arable land and farmers
 in the interests of economy, use      
 larger more efficient machines.       
 Existing hedgerows are uprooted to    
 give the equipment long, uninterrupted
 runs and room to manoeuvre. Along the 
 North Downs Way centuries-old trees   
 have been felled, creating large,     
 featureless expanses. When fields are 
 ploughed and planted, footpaths are   
 lost, forever unless re-established,  
 depriving people of the pleasures of  
 the countryside. As the ecological    
 balance is disturbed, indigenous      
 species disappear. However, even M20  
 cutting slopes provide a natural      
 habitat for animals and plants. Hawks 
 are commoner and foreign seeds dropped
 from vehicles germinate along the     
 verges.                               </content>
