		<title>09DAIRY FARMING IN NAPTON</title>
		<content> The farmer's wife milks 45 cows a day 
 and she gets up at 6 o'clock. The cows
 weigh 10 cwt. and are about 2 metres  
 long. It must be hard getting up at 6 
 o'clock.  It is funny that cows are so
 heavy and 2 metres long; I thought    
 they would be less. She gives the cows
 dairy cake, sugar beet, oats, hay and 
 wheat. They were fed twice a day.     
 On Monday we started to make some     
 cheese. First we put the milk in a    
 bowl. We left it over night in the    
 school. On Tuesday the teacher brought
 a lemon which we squeezed into the    
 bowl. Soon we saw the curds appearing 
 and then the whey. We tipped the whey 
 into the bowl, then we left it at     
 school for another night. On Thursday 
 we started to make butter. The teacher
 bought some cream, it cost 46p. we put
 the cream in a jar, then took turns to
 shake it, it soon became butter.      </content>
