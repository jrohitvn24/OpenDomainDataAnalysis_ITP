		<title>15Arrunden, near Holmfirth</title>
		<content> The lane leading to Arrunden is only  
 half a mile long and is in very poor  
 condition.There are three different   
 farms but only one farmyard.The farms 
 cover about 50-60 acres.The land is   
 used for grazing,silage,{haymaking}and
 a small area for vegetables.The hay is
 made by first cutting long grass and  
 then the grass is turned a number of  
 times by a machine until it is dry.The
 grass is put into rows by the         
 same machine.The machine uses a rail  
 at the back to help funnel the grass  
 into rows.After that the dry grass is 
 baled and taken to a barn.{Silage}is  
 cut and rowed but it is taken while it
 is green and then stored under sheets.
 There are eight families and four of  
 them work on the land.
