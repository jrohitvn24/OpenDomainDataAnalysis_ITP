		<content>1.Masts.                               
The masts are a common sight in        
Leafield.We have a large mast behind   
the butcher's shop.It is for calls to  
the Police,Ambulance or Fire service.  
Nobody wanted it to be put up because  
they said it spoilt the village.I      
don't think it spoils the village as   
much as the new houses do.             
2.The New House.                       
The new house is north west from the   
school.It has been there for a year.It 
is yellow and ugly and one side is     
thinner than the other.The bricks      
don't look right and it's out of       
shape.Nobody lives in it yet.
