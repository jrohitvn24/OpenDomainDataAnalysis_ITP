		<title>10Marston's Haulage Business.</title>
		<content>  {Mr.Derek Marston}has had a haulage  
 business at Heath Holding,Halfway     
 House,for thirteen years.Once he      
 employed six drivers,but since the    
 recession he's done his own mainten-  
 ance and employs two men for his two  
 lorries,each with a carrying capacity 
 of twenty five tonnes.                
  Most of his work is connected with   
 agriculture.The lorries move poultry, 
 grit from Halkyn,bricks from Butting- 
 ton,concrete for silage pits,timber   
 from Welshpool,stone from local       
 quarries,steel buildings from Westbury
 and pig meal.                         
  Marston's will take anything,anywhere
 in the country.Once they moved a      
{complete farm}to Cornwall,and recently
 a{narrow boat}from Liverpool to the   
 canal at Welsh Frankton.The lorries   
 are so high up that most of our class 
 could walk uderneath them.            </content>
