		<content>  The survey area is predominantly     
rural, the relatively small urban areas
being mainly residential.  There are   
four housing estates, each well served 
with amenities, catering for some of   
the residential needs of Stafford's    
workforce whilst some of the housing is
for commuters who work in the West     
Midlands.                              
  The river Penk flows North-South     
through the area, the river valley     
accommodating communication links      
including the M6 motorway, A449 trunk  
road, the Stafford to London railway   
line and the Staffordshire &amp;           
Worcestershire Canal.  The flood plain 
of the Penk is quite marshy and        
flooding is common,restricting         
agricultural use.   Farming within the 
area is centred around the villages of 
Acton Trussell and Bednall.
