		<title>15HISTORIC HOUSES IN BURY/H'TN</title>
		<content>{BURY MANOR.}Owned originally by the   
 Countess Goda, sister of Edward the   
 Confessor, but in 1085 given by       
 William the Conqueror to the          
 Benedictine monks who farmed the land 
 until the dissolution of the          
 monasteries in 1536. The Lord of the  
 Manor became the Duke of Norfolk, and 
 he occasionally held a Manor Court    
 there mainly to decide on farming     
 rights as the manor land then         
 stretched out as far as Surrey. Then  
 in the 1920's it was bought privately 
 by Londoners who used it as a         
 luxurious weekend cottage. In 1964 it 
 was bought by its present owners the  
 Bury Manor School Trust Committee, who
 turned it into a Boys Prep. School of 
 about 100 boys. They made several     
 minor changes and some additional     
 buildings were built but the original 
 Manor building has been preserved.    </content>
