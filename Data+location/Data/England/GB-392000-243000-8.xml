 Pershore is a mixture of detached,    
 semi_detached, terraced and           
 farmhouses.  There are a few very old 
 houses down{Broad Street and Bridge   
{Street}which date back to the         
 eighteenth century.  These houses are 
 Tudor with Georgian Facades on the    
 road side.  When some of the Abbey    
 was knocked down the stone was used to
 build houses.  People have found      
 statues from the Abbey in their       
 garages and houses.                   
 There are some modern flats in        
 Pershore and{old folks}are well       
 provided for in sheltered accommoda_  
 tion.  There is an extensive Council  
 Estate at Abbey Park and three large  
 Private Estates. In rural areas the   
 growers have large detached houses or 
 bungalows with their land attached.
