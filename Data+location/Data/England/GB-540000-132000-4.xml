		<title>04BROADSTONE FARM</title>
		<content> Broadstone Farm has had many different
 uses over the years. Mr. Cranfield,   
 the owner for the past 35 years,has   
 been involved in pigs and chickens as 
 well as some crops but nowadays he    
 spends his time hand making {Windsor} 
 chairs from timber grown on the farm. 
 Ash,Beech,Hazel and Sweet Chestnut    
 are all used in the chair             
 construction. His wife has an {art    
{studio next to the workshop.          
 The farm comprises some {150 acres}   
 adjacent to the Ashdown Forest and is 
 probably worth in the region of{three 
{hundred thousand pounds.}             
 The Cranfields have seen many changes 
 to the local environment over the     
 years and although they do not think  
 that all of them have been for the    
 better they lead happy and contented  
 lives on their farm.
