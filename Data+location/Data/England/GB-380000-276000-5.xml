		<content> finished doing what they asked for,   
 they  say "Freeze."Then they have     
 to stay in the position that they     
 landed in when they said"Freeze". When
 every one has been given a go from the
 person in the middle,they have to     
 stand still while the person that was 
 in the middle comes round and tells   
 you what you have to be. When she has 
 told everyone what to do,she says "   
 toy town begin."Then when every one   
 has done what they have to do she says
 "Toy town go to sleep." She goes round
 and taps every one,but one person and 
 every one makes a ring around her and 
 sings "------'s got the measles ,-----
 's got the measles, she's got to get  
 out of toy town before ten o'clock."  
 Then they count to ten and if they get
 out they are on and the same happens  
 again.                                
                                       </content>
