		<title>19Shipley Mill/Hilaire Belloc</title>
		<content> Built 1879 for Â£2500, the youngest and
 biggest smock mill in Sussex passed   
 into ownership of Belloc in 1906 when 
 he bought Kings Land, built on Templar
 12th C. foundations. Little changed   
 since the 18th C.,house guests include
 Winston Churchill, G.K.Chesterton and 
 possibly Edward II. Mr."Bunny" Bennett
 of Coolham worked for Powells, millers
 , from 14 yrs  (5s for 48hr.wk.) to   
 retiremement and vividly recalls work 
 in the Mill. After Belloc's death 1953
 the Mill was repaired and a memorial  
 plaque sited. In 1979 celebrations    
 marked the Mill's centenary.A local   
 custodian for the Mill, now owned by  
 Hilaire Belloc's descendants, arranges
 public open days (adult 50p child     
 20p). Preserved by The Friends of     
 Shipley Windmill and backed by West   
 Sussex County Council, Â£50,000 is     
 still needed for essential repairs.   </content>
