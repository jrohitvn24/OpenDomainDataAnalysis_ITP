		<title>04WHITELEAF CROSS, CHILTERNS</title>
		<content>From a great distance, the Whiteleaf   
cross cut into the chalk above the     
village of Whiteleaf, near Princes     
Risborough, can be seen across the Vale
of Aylesbury. Oddly it is not so easy  
to see from just below as the trees    
obscure it.                            
It is one of Southern Englands great   
chalk figures and it is widely believed
to be a pagan symbol which was         
'improved' hundreds of years later,    
perhaps by the monks of Monks          
Risborough, two miles away.            
It may have served travellers as a     
primitive indication of a trackway down
through the thick forest of the        
Chilterns to the Icknield way.         
To approach the cross from the woodland
paths above it suddenly the banches    
seem to open out and there below the   
feet, the wide chalk scar reaches      
breathtakingly downwards.              </content>
