		<title>19Bristol's Science/Technology</title>
		<content> Because our 12km square is based on   
 the centre of a city, Science and     
 Technology is very well represented.  
 Bristol University has developed many 
 new ideas in the science field and a  
 great deal of research is carried on  
 in the fields of Chemistry, Physics   
 and Natural Sciences.  The Bristol    
 Royal Infirmary has many very modern  
 machines used daily for diagnosis,    
 medication and research.  Schools in  
 the area use computers.               
 Many of the large department stores in
 our area use modern technology to     
 record sales, to keep stock records   
 and also for deliveries.              
 The Central Police Station (The       
 Bridewell) uses technology to control 
 crime in the central area and to make 
 sure the inner city traffic flows     
 smoothly.                             
                                       </content>
