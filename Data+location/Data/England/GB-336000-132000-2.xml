		<title>02The village of Middlezoy</title>
		<content> The village of Middlezoy, together    
 with the outlying hamlets of          
 Thorngrove and Greylake consists of   
 some 206 dwellings and has a          
 population of 561.  There are 114     
 children under 18, 48 of whom attend  
 the village primary school, and a     
 retired population of 109.            
 Middlezoy, once totally involved in   
 farming, still has 12 working farms   
 within the village, but these now only
 provide minimal employment.  The      
 majority of workers in the village    
 commute to Bridgwater or Taunton      
 areas, although there are several     
 self-employed within the village. The 
 village has one public house, one shop
 and post office combined, one primary 
 school, a Church of England church, a 
 Methodist chapel and a village hall.
