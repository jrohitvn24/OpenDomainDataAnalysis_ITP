		<title>14The Public House at Hexton</title>
		<content> The Public House at Hexton is called  
 the Raven. It is a new building but it
 has been made to look old so that it  
 matches the village houses. A landlord
 runs the pub and he employs ten       
 workers. The Raven has a large bar    
 where customers can drink beer and a  
 large variety of alcoholic drinks.    
 Children are not allowed in the bar   
 but they may go into the pool room,   
 where pool, darts and slot machines   
 are played. There is a busy dining    
 room where lunches and snacks are     
 served each day. About 40 people visit
 the pub each night but there are more 
 on Fridays and Saturdays. 12 people   
 from the village regularly visit the  
 Raven. The pub is open each day from  
 1130 to 1430 and from 1800 to 2230    
 hours.
