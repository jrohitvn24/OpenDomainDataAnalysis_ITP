		<content> Mrs.Leng remembered there was a{      
{'knocker-up'}who came around early    
 each morning and banged on people's   
 bedroom windows with a long stick.He  
 did not go away until a light went    
 on.He was paid a small fee by people  
 requiring his services and his        
 nick-name was{"bumps"}The{gas-lamps}  
 were lit each night by a{lamp-lighter}
 and put out again each                
 morning.Everyone looked forward to    
 their annual holiday,if they went away
 at all they visited{                  
{Morecambe,Blackpool or Scarborough}by 
 train or coach.                       
 After living in the area for so       
 long,Mrs.Wright 56 years and Mrs.Leng 
 36 years,both ladies said that things 
 were very different in                
 1985.However,neither of them would    
 choose to move away as{Rawthorpe Lane 
{was their home. }                     </content>
