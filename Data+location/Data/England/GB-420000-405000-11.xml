		<content> Entertainment is very limited due to  
 the rural nature of Denby. Most       
{concerts or discos}that occur are held
 in the hall of the primary school and 
 organised by the various clubs in the 
 village. The pub, which is in the     
 centre of village is called The       
 George. Each week it has a{Goldies    
{Oldies}evening. It also provides      
 lunches and bar snacks. Each Boxing   
 Day it hosts the{local hunt-the       
{Rockwood Harriers}-to which hundreds  
 of spectators come. This hunt rides   
 the Denby area throughout the winter. 
{The Gunthwaite Steam Preservation     
{Society}hold a one day event annually 
 demonstrating the old farm machinery  
 together with craft stalls etc at a   
 farm in the village. Each Xmas{carol  
{singing}around the village is arranged
 as will as a{community bonfire}in     
 November.                             </content>
