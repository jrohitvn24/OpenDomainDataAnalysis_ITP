		<title>14RIDGE CLOSE FARM,DOVE HOLES.</title>
		<content> The farm is owned by Derek Shaw &amp; is  
 dairy farm of l30 acres,half of which 
 are used for grazing &amp; half for hay &amp; 
 silage. He rents some land from ICI.  
 The land is marshy,rocky &amp; uneven &amp; at
 one time was used for lead-mining.    
 Because of this the land is liable to 
 subsidence. The farm is crossed by the
 cutting of the Peak Forest Tramway.   
 The daily milk yield of 800 litres    
 from 57 cows goes to the dairy at     
 Hyde.The machinery for grass-cutting  
 is expensive to buy &amp; Mr.Shaw finds it
 difficult to make a profit &amp; believes 
 that future farming will suffer from  
 over-production. He feels that the    
 public should be able to buy extra    
 food cheaper.He is a cornet player    
 with Dove Holes Band but does not have
 a lot of leisure time.
