 My day began at 7-30 a.m. with a cup  
 of tea in bed-listening to the B.B.C. 
 news,toast and home made marmalade,   
 reading newspaper and mail_delivered  
 daily. After breakfast, walked to the 
 Butchers, past the Blacksmith's to the
 P.O. to collect weekly pension,Â£36.78 
 Bought loaf of brown bread from the   
 Bakery(49p).  Returned home and cooked
 mid_day meal_pork chop, apple sauce,  
 garden vegetables, strawberries &amp;     
 clotted cream.                        
 P.M. Drove to Budleigh Salterton, went
 to bank and Library.   Returning to   
 Otterton, called on my daughter and 3 
 little grand_daughters, just home from
 the Village School. Watched Wimbledon 
 on T.V. before going to a Barbecue at 
 Bicton Park with the W.I.    And so to
 bed with a book before 'lights out'.  </content>
