		<title>08DANES DYKE, FLAMBOROUGH</title>
		<content> Danes Dyke is an earthwork believed to
 have been constructed by Stone Age or 
 Bronze Age men. It consists of a ditch
 60ft wide and a bank 18ft high on the 
 eastern side. The Dyke is one of the  
 landing places of the Vikings. Today  
 one side is unspoilt woodland         
 containing deer, foxes, badgers and   
 other wild creatures. The part to the 
 south of the main by road is          
 pre-glacial valley where steep sides  
 are covered with deciduous trees      
 planted as part of the gardens of a   
 large house, since demolished. It is  
 now a nature trail and leisure area.  
 There is a car park, shop and toilets.
 There is also a big patch of grass    
 where you can play ball games. There  
 is also a picnic area. A steep path   
 leads down to the beach. Danes Dyke is
 supposed to be haunted by a ghost     
 at midnight called the 'White Lady'.  </content>
