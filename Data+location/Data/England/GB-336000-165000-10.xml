		<title>10SERVICES WOODSPRING VILLAGES</title>
		<content> Wick St. Lawrence has no village shop,
 Post Office or public house but there 
 is a public telephone kiosk. Kingston 
 Seymour has a general store with a    
 sub-post office but no public house.  
 Milk and coal are delivered to both   
 villages. It is necessary to go to    
 Clevedon,Yatton,Worle or Weston Super 
 Mare for doctors,dentists,lawyers and 
 medical prescriptions. Doctors do make
 house calls when necessary.Neither    
 village has a policeman. There are    
 police, fire and ambulance stations in
 Weston,Clevedon and Nailsea.          
 Of the public utilaties electricity,  
 water and main drainage are available 
 in both villages.There is no gas      
 supply or street lighting to either   
 village.The apparent lack of services 
 does not seem to be  a deprivation as 
 all emergencies are answered just as  
 quickly as in the towns.              </content>
