		<content> June 28th - very wet. At Home Farm    
 third 3OO tonne clamp of silage now   
 complete 2 weeks later than normal. It
 has been covered with plastic sheeting
 and held down with old car tyres. The 
 17O Jersey cows are out at grass,     
 coming to be milked by the 2 herdsmen 
 at 6am and 3 pm. Milking takes just 2 
 hours through a 1O x 2O herringbone   
 parlour. This year's yield-first 3    
 months-below quota set by the EEC.    
 The winter wheat - Norman, Fenman,    
 Stetson - and winter barley - Igri    
 look well, bowed by the heavy rain the
 main danger comes from mildew and     
 yellow rust, which could cause loss of
 yeild and quality.  Prices falling    
 (despite famine in Africa) due to     
 large surplus in EEC and USA. Tonight 
 the National Farmers Union are holding
 a farm walk here with a supper        
 afterwards.                           </content>
