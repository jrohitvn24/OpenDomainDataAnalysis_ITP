 Royal Wedding of Princess Louise of

 King Alfonso of Spain,Queen Amelia of 
 Portugal,the Grand Duke and Duchess   
 Vladimir of Russia,the Comte and      
 Comtesse of Caserta,Princess Maria Pia
 of Bourbon,Princess Marie-Josephine of
 Bourbon,Princess Stephanie of Belgium,
 Prince and Princess Alphonse of       
 Barvaria and many others including    
 representatives of the English Royal  
 Family.                               
   The chapel at Wood Norton was too   
 small for the wedding and another     
 chapel was erected on the lawn. This  
 had not been consecrated so at the    
 last minute the civil wedding had to  
 be held in a corrugated hut down Avon 
 Street, Evesham. The main ceremony was
 then held at Wood Norton.
