 grounds to the north of the village   
 green.Since the late sixties,when the 
 3 tier system was introduced in this  
 area,it has catered for children aged 
 from 4 &amp; half to 9 years,after which  
 they normally transfer to Royston.

 9 years.There are 2.1 teachers &amp;      
 part-time staff include a secretary,

 varied in recent years from 17 to 40  
 plus;in 1985 there are 29 on role from
