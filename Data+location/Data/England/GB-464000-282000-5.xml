		<content> Mrs Lister has lived in the village   
 for 24 years. Before Mr&amp;Mrs Lister    
 moved to the village they lived in    
 Leicester. When they moved out here   
 they both thought it was the end of   
 the world it was fourteen miles from  
 Leicester and neither of them could   
 drive but they would never like to go 
 back to the town now.If she did'nt    
 work she would just like to be a      
 housewife and stay at home.They have  
 an office in the village which sells  
 power tools. They sell the tools to   
 big firms,large factories,shops and   
 engineering factories and to lots     
 of other places as well.They have been
 in the business for eight years.Before
 she worked here she worked in a       
 building society,a printing factory in
 Market Harborough and she also worked 
 at Waltons Land Drainage at Sulby.Mr  
 Lister also teaches tennis.           </content>
