 can get badly hurt.  They also ride   
 about on their bikes late at night    
 when people are in bed.               
                                       
{THE PARK IN TUXFORD (E74.2/7O.6N)     
                                       
 The park near my house has a few      
 dangerous things, there was a see-saw 
 and a few weeks ago when I went there 
 they had taken the part which you sit 
 on off, and it just had the bottom on 
 and it was sharp. I like the logs     
 which they made into things you can   
 climb on.  I think that people who go 
 there should take more care of the    
 things we have to play on.  Some      
 people don't appreciate them because  
 there are only the bars left for the  
 swings and somebody could easily get  
 hurt.
