		<content> This southern area of Cheshire has a  
 basically North West Midland dialect, 
 in which certain letters are exchanged
 in the spelling of{words,}and various 
 sounds are similarly exchanged. Words 
 are often shortened for example by the
 dropping of the letter H at the start 
 of the word e.g.bonk-bank, mon-man,   
 ommer-hammer, ond-hand, teel-tail,    
 dee- day,feever-favour.{              
{Place names}are also simplified and   
 shortened e.g. Aulem- Audlem, Ooton-  
 Oulton, Budorth- Budworth, Wembury-   
 Wybunbury and Wetna-Wettenhall. Our   
 village is called Minsha. Nearby is   
 Chomson- Cholomondeston.              
 Other words are thrutch-push, nowt-   
 nothing, neet- night. Sentences can be
 severely abbreviated A winna tell thi-
 I will not tell you. Anna thee done   
 up? - Are you not exhausted? Oo in    
 tin- she is not at home.              </content>
