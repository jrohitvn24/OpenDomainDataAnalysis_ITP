		<content> On Saturday we get up around 8.30am.  
 My dad takes my sister to the Golf    
 Club. Mum and I tidy the house, wash  
 and iron. Sometimes I go into town    
 with my friends. When I get back I do 
 about an hour's piano practice. By    
 this time Melanie and dad are back and
 we all sit down to dinner.            
                                       
 On Saturday I don't have to go to     
 school, so I lie in bed until 11.00am.
 I get up and get dressed in jeans and 
 a jumper. I tidy my room, have a wash 
 and go downstairs. For breakfast I    
 have Shreddies or Rice Krispies.      
    I play outside with my sister. We  
 roller scate around the Block. I have 
 lunch of beans on toast, sandwiches or
 cheese on toast. After lunch, I call

 we go back to my house to listen to   </content>
