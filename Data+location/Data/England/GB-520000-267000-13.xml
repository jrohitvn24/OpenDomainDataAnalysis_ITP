		<title>13Landsmans</title>
		<content>{Landsmans}started in 1947 when lots of
 people did not have houses and they   
 lived in{caravans.}Mr.Spreckley used  
 his land rover to move caravans from  
 place to place.Another man joined him,
 then another and they had 3 land      
 rovers working.He began selling       
 caravans from his home. Then he moved 
 to a larger site  in{Buckden Road}and 
 he began to employ people to repair   
 caravans.Later he had a factory in    
 Huntingdon where they made caravans   
 (but this is closed now).He began     
 making mobile dormitories,offices &amp;   
 toilets and taking them wherever they 
 were needed.Now they maintain these   
 and service them and take them all    
 over the country to building sites and
 shows.Landsmans was one of the first  
 firms to introduce{co-ownership.
