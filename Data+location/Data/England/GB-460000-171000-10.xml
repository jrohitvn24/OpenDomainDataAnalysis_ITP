		<title>10CHILDREN'S WORRIES</title>
		<content> A survey was conducted amongst 14 year
 old children at Theale Green School   
 during July 1985 to establish what    
 they were concerned or worried about. 
 Considering the number of nuclear     
 related sites in the area, it is not  
 surprising that the most overwhelming 
 fear was that of a nuclear war. Almost
 every child was deeply worried about  
 this. Schoolwork was the second       
 greatest concern of the children. This
 was followed - in order of concern -  
 by relations with friends, the        
 environment ( in particular the       
 increasing housing and industry in the
 area ), relations with parents, fear  
 of getting a serious disease, worries 
 about getting a job and concern for   
 the well-being of their pets. There   
 was no marked difference in the       
 responses of boys and girls in this   
 survey.                               </content>
