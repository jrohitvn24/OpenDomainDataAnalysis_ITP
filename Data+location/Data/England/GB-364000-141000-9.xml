		<title>09SAINT ALDHELM</title>
		<content>  In 705{King Ina}decided that his     
{Kingdom of Wessex}was too big for one 
{bishop}so he split it into two and    
 made Aldhelm the{Bishop of Sherborne. 
 Aldhelm was 70 then. Aldhelm decided  
 that he would walk around his diocese 
 to see what it was like.He used to    
 sing hymns to attract people to his   
 preaching and baptized a lot people in
 local streams. When he was on one of  
 these trips he visited a pagan uncle  
 of his who lived at{Cannards Grave    
 which is about one mile from Doulting.
 During this stay he felt ill and      
 realised he was going to die.He didn't
 want to die in a pagan house so he was
 carried to the wooden church at       
 Doulting where he died in 709.The     
 monks at{Glastonbury}allowed some     
 people to build a church from{Doulting
{stone}in Aldhelm's memory.
