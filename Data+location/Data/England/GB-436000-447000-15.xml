		<title>15WETHERBY SCHOOL NURSE</title>
		<content>  The school nurse began her training  
 in 1951. After she had qualified she  
 married and left nursing to have her  
 family, then in 1965 she came to      
 Wetherby as a school nurse. She has   
 been in the nursing profession now for
 34 years.                             
  She visits six schools, dealing with 
 about 880 children. Her role is to    
 help children get the best out of     
 school. She inspects their hair and   
 eyes and does hearing tests, as the   
 most common problems she finds are    
 hearing and sight defects and head    
 lice. If she finds anything seriously 
 wrong she sends the child to the      
 school doctor.                        
  Our nurse has never worn a uniform   
 because she does not want to frighten 
 the younger children. To be a school  
 nurse you have to like children and   
 ours most certainly does.             </content>
