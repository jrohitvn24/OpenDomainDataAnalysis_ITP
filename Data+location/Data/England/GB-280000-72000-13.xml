		<title>13LIFE AT A VILLAGE SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> We go on visits and find out as much  
 as possible about the theme. We have  
 two plays one at 10:30 and one at     
 12:15,that lasts until 1:30,then the  
 bell rings and we line up and lead    
 into the hall where we have assembly. 
 In assembly we talk about God,say     
 prayers and sing hymns. In the        
 afternoon we have games such as       
 rounders,running and netball,and the  
 boys play cricket and football.The    
 bell rings for end of school at 3:30, 
 but we don't always get out of school 
 on time because we talk too much. In  
 the evening I go swimming at Dawlish. 
 I do this every week and I'm the      
 youngest in my group but not the      
 slowest.Sometimes after school there  
 are sports practices and matches      
 against other schools.Soon we are to  
 hold our P.T.A. fete raising money for
 our new school minibus.               </content>
