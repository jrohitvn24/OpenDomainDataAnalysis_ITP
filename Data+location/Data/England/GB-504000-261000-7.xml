		<title>07TOY MAKING IN RISELEY</title>
		<content>                                       
      The newest industry in Riseley   
 was started two years ago by Mr.      
 Cooper who enjoyed making furniture   
 for his daughters' large dolls.  It is
 a small firm in a double garage by the
 side of his house.                    
      Before he manufactures anything  
 he designs it and makes a prototype.  
 He then takes on the role of salesman 
 and goes out to shops to try to get   
 orders or perhaps has a stand at a toy
 fair which will be visited by many    
 shopkeepers.                          
      His firm manufactures mostly     
 bedroom furniture from plastic coated 
 chipboard which he cuts to shape and  
 drills as necessary.  The pieces are  
 then fixed together by Upper School   
 Pupils using pegs and glue.           
      Ladies in the village are paid to
 sew quilts etc. in their own homes.   </content>
