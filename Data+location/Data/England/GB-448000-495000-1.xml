		<title>01Moors East of Osmotherley</title>
		<content> The overwhelming impression of this   
 National Park land is of a vast open  
 space covered in heather. There are   
 softly undulating hills to the north  
 west where sheep wander freely, and   
 pheasants, grouse and partridges seek 
 cover from the shooting parties, and V
 shaped valleys with steams to the     
 south east.A few farms are also in the
 south east of the block and here the  
 majority of the enclosed grazing for  
 sheep and cattle is to be found. Game 
 birds are very common in this         
 region,also and grouse butts are      
 scattered throughout most of the      
 heather coverd moors.  There is one   
 mostly unfenced, minor road across    
 the south pf the block. and a private 
 road in the south east corner, heading
 north to the farms and shooting lodges
 up the valley. Also in south east are 
 conifer plantations                   </content>
