		<content> The main road through the Dale is the 
 A684. Running east-west from          
 Northallerton to Kendal it follows    
 the Ure's south bank through this     
 area. The erstwhile turnpike from     
 Richmond to Lancaster runs to the     
 north of the Ure. The two are joined  
 by smaller roads crossing the Ure from
 Worton and Bainbridge. The Roman road 
 from Brough Roman Fort (Virosidum) to 
 Lancaster is still visible.           
 Traffic on the A684 has increased     
 considerably in the past few years,   
 especially as a result of tourism. A  
 recent decision of the County Council 
 to apply for an upgrading of the road 
 has led to fierce local opposition by 
 those who fear that the further       
 increase in traffic will destroy the  
 character of the Dale and its         
 villages.
