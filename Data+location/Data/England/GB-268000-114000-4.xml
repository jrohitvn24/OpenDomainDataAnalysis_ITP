		<content> School's field and Changing Room. The 
 Golf Club, as yet without its 19th    
 hole, is in its first decade of       
 existence. A small 'par three' course 
 beside the village with its pond,     
 copsewood and rough; all folding into 
 a well-looked-after course which is   
 well used. The 'Over Sixties', and the
 1961 Club  for OAPs, endeavour to     
 cater for as many of their needs as   
 practicable. The W.I. enjoy their     
 monthly meetings; as do the British   
 Legion, who are always the biggest    
 group on the annual Armistice Day's   
 Parade. The Twinning Club (Fontennay  
 Le-Marmion) is a lively organisation. 
{ECOLOGY}  The area, part of upland SW 
 UK receives some 1000mm of rain       
 annually - throughout the year with   
 more rain falling in winter than      
 summer. Unlike other parts of the SW  
 our springs are not quite so 'early'. </content>
