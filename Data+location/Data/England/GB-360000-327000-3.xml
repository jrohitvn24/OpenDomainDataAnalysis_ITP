		<title>03THE HUNDRED HOUSE</title>
		<content> Hundred House is a fine example of a  
 Tudor black and white house.  It      
 stands in the centre of the village at
 the junction of the A53/A442 roads.   
 It is a half-timbered house.          
 For many centuries, the villagers had 
 the right to elect their own{CORONER} 
 on the steps of this house.           
 Many centuries ago, it was also known 
 as a{"Holly}Bush", because when there 
 was a{Fair, Wake or Gala,}in the      
 village, home brewed ale and wines    
 were sold there.  To show that this   
 was legal, a holly bush was hung over 
 the front door.                       
 Up until the 1950's, the{Court Leet   
 was still held there every seven years
 This was an old court where the Lord  
 of the Manor could try petty crimes of
 the villagers.  The present occupiers 
 of the lovely house are Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jim
 Williams.  Carol Bennett/D. Hewitt.   </content>
