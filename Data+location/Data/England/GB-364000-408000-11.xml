		<content> There are lots of programmes on T.V. I
 have several favourite programmes such
 as{Advanced Dungeons and Dragons}which
 is about six people transported to    
 another dimension given magical       
 weapons and who try to escape. I think
 it is a good cartoon. Another of my   
 favourites is{Street Hawk.}It is about
 a motor bike which can travel at three
 hundred miles an hour and has a laser 
 machine gun and missiles. I also like 
 watching cartoons. My favourites are  
{Road Runner,}a bird which defies      
 Cayote's amazing traps,{Tom and Jerry 
 and{Bugs Bunny.}I don't like soap     
 operas such as{Dynasty}or{Dallas      
 however.                              
   Sunday is the worst day for T.V.    
 because in the morning there is{Songs 
{of Praise,}in the afternoon there are 
{Political programmes}and in the       
 evening there is{Songs of Praise again</content>
