		<title>07Employment Survey in Windsor</title>
		<content>  We are not allowed to ride our bikes 
 to school because of heavy traffic.   
 Dedworth is only two miles from the M4
 so we carried out an employment survey
 to find out what kinds of jobs our    
 parents have and how far they travel. 
  178 families replied to our survey   
 and we discovered that 317 parents    
 have jobs. There was only one home    
 where no one worked because both      
 parents were disabled.                
  We were interested in the kinds of   
 jobs our parents did and divided them 
 into 3 groups. Our results showed:    
  1) Only 0.6% of parents were employed
 in{Primary Industry}where people are  
 producing raw materials e.g. farming, 
 mining.                               
  2) 7.6% were employed in{Secondary   
{Industry,}which is manufacturing a    
 product.                              
                                       </content>
