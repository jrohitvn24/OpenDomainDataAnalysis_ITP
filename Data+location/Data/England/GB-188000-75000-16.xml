		<title>16PADSTOW RED CROSS CADETS</title>
		<content> Padstow Red Cross Cadets meet every   
 Monday at 6.30 p.m. and it lasts for  
 one hour.We learn all about First Aid.
 To test what we have learnt we are    
 given exams and to practice for the   
 tests we have competitions.Our leader 
 splits us up into two teams and then  
 chooses one of us to be the patient,  
 the rest of us then have to go to the 
 other end of the hut.Next we are told 
 what is wrong with the patient and we 
 have to take the right course of      
 action.Sometimes it might just be a   
 broken arm and we have to find the    
 correct bandage to make a sling,      
 however, it could be something more   
 serious and we have to administer     
 artificial respiration.We do other    
 things as well like drawing pictures, 
 going out on visits,going to the      
 cinema and roller-skating.I am a Cadet
 because I want to be a doctor.        </content>
