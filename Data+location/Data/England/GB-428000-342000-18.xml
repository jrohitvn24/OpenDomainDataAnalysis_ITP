		<content> dogs but there are some men who go    
 around the area of Richard Lees in    
 blue vans.  They have safety          
 precautions by having training courses
 and supervised workers.  The office   
 people's hours are 9 am till 5pm.  The
 factory people work two shifts; one is
 6 am till 5 pm the other 2 pm till 10 
 pm.  The whole company covers 15 acres
 of land.                              
    The people at Richard Lees start   
 work at 16 years.  The boss of the    
 company is Mr. McPherson.  They have  
 50,000 square metres of concrete slabs
 in the storage yard.   The waste      
 concrete slabs are disposed of at     
 Highfields Lane near Leasows Farm.    
 They are tipped into a large hole,    
 from which sand was previously        
 extracted.  There used to be sand_    
 martins' nests in the quarry, but the 
 sand-martins are no longer there.     </content>
