		<title>02COASTLINE  RYDE TO PUCKPOOL</title>
		<content>  Walking east from Ryde Boating Lake  
 we come to{Appley.}There is a bay     
 stretching 1km to{Puckpool Point.}At  
 low tide the {Ryde East Sands}stretch 
 2km out to sea. Walking past the{Ryde 
{Lifeguard Station}we can see the roof 
 of{St Cecilia's Abbey} where          
 Benedictine nuns live. Originally     
 called {Appley House,}it was built in 
 the 18th Century by a local smuggler  
 called David Boyce. Half way along the
 coastal path on the sea wall is{Appley
{Tower}a folly built like a miniture   
 castle. Bordering the shore the land  
 rises gently and is covered with a    
 variety of trees. Once the parkland of
 several large mansions it now has{two 
{public parks, a golf course and two   
{holiday camps.}At Puckpool Point, in  
 Puckpool Park, are the remains of a{  
{coastal mortar battery}completed in   
 1865.                                 </content>
