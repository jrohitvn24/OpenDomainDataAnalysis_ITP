		<title>05Lundy South Light.</title>
		<content> George is one of the lighthouse       
 keepers and he showed us round.First  
 we saw the engine room-there were 3   
 generators running and one in reserve.
 There were also 2 compressors-one in  
 reserve.There are also batteries      
 which will last for 24 hours in the   
 case of a breakdown.An identifying    
 cross-bearing radio signal is sent    
 out every six minutes.                
 The North Light is operated from the  
 South and there is equipment to test  
 the resistance in the connecting      
 cable.                                
 Then we went up to the light.The bulb 
 is a 1000 Watt.Above the light is the 
 foghorn which woke us up on Monday    
 morning.It goes off every 25 seconds. 
  Supplies,including,diesel are now    
 brought in by helicopter.The keepers  
 do shifts of 28 days.George comes from
 Manchester.        {David Hinchliffe.}</content>
