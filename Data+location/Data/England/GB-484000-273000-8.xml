 The Juniors dance three traditional   
{country dances.} The{Maypole}is placed
 in the centre of the playground. Six  
 boys lead their partners to the       
 maypole, pick up their braids and     
 dance the Barber's Pole, Single       
 Plaitting, Spider's Web, Gipsy's Tent 
 and Double Plaitting dances. They drop
 their braids and skip round the       
 maypole three times and round the side
 of the school.  The rest of the school
 follow with the May Queen walking last
                                       
 There are various stalls and games    
 such as Lucky Dip, Skittles, Tombola, 
 Ice Cream and Drinks, Coffee and Cakes
 and White Elephant around the school. 
                                       
 At the end of the day everyone goes   
 home.                                 </content>
