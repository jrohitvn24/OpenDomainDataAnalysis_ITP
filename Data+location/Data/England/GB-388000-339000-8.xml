		<content>Ornamenting is the next stage of making
pottery. Ornamenters apply the figures 
to the ornament (e.g. vase). It takes  
two years to train to be an ornamenter.
During firing the colours develop. The 
ornament turns blue and the figures    
turn white. Jasper shrinks 15% during  
firing, and bone china shrinks 5%.     
Lithographing is one of the ways of    
decorating. The transfers have a       
plastic backing on them , which are cut
down to size and then gently put onto  
the ornament without air being trapped 
underneath. The plastic backing is     
burnt away during firing. It takes 6   
months basic training to be a          
lithographer.                          
Raised gold is another form of         
decorating. The gold that is used is   
real. One plate can cost 190 pounds. It
takes 3 years training to learn how to 
raise gold.                            </content>
