In January and February it is the      
lambing season and it is often         
difficult for the milk tanker to get   
through the snow.                      
                                       
In March, lambing is coming to an end  
and the farmers are carting and        
spreading muck to fertilize the fields.
The cows are let out during the day but
are brought in at night.               
                                       
By April muck spreading has stopped and
the cows are let out at all times.     
                                       
In May and June silageing is taking    
place.  This involves mowing the grass,
leaving it to dry for a day, then      
chopping it and putting it into a shed 
to be used for winter feed.
