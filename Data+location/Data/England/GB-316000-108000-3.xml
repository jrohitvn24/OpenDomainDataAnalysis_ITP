		<title>03SMEATHARPE AERODROME NOW</title>
		<content> Obviously, Smeatharpe was chosen as   
 the site for an aerodrome because of  
 its altitude and rural setting.  For  
 these same reasons in 1985, a great   
 deal of military and civil aircraft   
 pass over the village by day and      
 night.                                
 The Blackdown Model Aircraft Club uses
 the aerodrome to fly their remote-    
 controlled planes.  Recently, motor-  
 ised hang-gliders have joined the     
 aerial traffic around Smeatharpe.     
 There is a stock-car and banger racing
 stadium on the aerodrome, which has   
 hundreds of spectators on Sundays.    
 The buildings on the aerodrome are in 
 various states of repair, some        
 derelict, some used for storing farm  
 machinery etc.  The runways are still 
 there, although a small part has      
 recently been taken up.  The area     
 between is now grazing or arable land.</content>
