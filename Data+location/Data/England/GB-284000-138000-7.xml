		<title>07Wild Ponies Of Exmoor</title>
		<content> On Exmoor there are wild ponies,we    
 went up to Stone Down to see Mr. Darby
 Haddon's herd of 50 mares and 4       
 stallions.The ponies live on the moor 
 and are shy.They foal in the middle of
 May a mare can have about 25 foals in 
 her lifetime.The ponies eat heather   
 and grass,in the winter they are fed  
 hay.We saw many different coloured    
 ponies the dark ones stand the cold   
 better.They are not pure bred Exmoor  
 which are naughty and not very good   
 for children.David Hill who looks     
 after them said that they run quickly 
 about 50 miles an hour and can jump   
 over gates.Some have to be slaughtered
 for horsemeat.Ponies used to be very  
 useful,pulling ploughs and gathering  
 up the stock.It is sad that we don't  
 need them so much these days.
