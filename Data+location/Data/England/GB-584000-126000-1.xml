		<title>01Hexden and Roter Levels</title>
		<content> This area is flat, marshy grassland   
 intersected from east to west by the  
 Hexden Channel and River Rother. Most 
 of the field boundaries are dikes,    
 there are three isolated farms and a  
 few scattered cottages. It has hardly 
 changed in 150 years. The grazing is  
 excellent for fattening sheep and     
 cattle there are some wheatfields     
 and natural woodland in the areas.    
 Outsiders are attracted by the        
 birdlife and fishing (though we have  
 lately had a disastrous spillage from 
 a wood treatment works on the Newmill 
 Channel) by the attractive Kent and   
 East Sussex Light Railway, now        
 restored largely by volunteers, and by
 some archaeological sites, notable    
 Newenden castle toll.
