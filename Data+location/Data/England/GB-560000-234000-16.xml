		<title>16DICK TURPIN IN THE SAMPFORDS</title>
		<content> Dick Turpin 1706 _ 1739               
 Dick Turpin was born 1706, he lived in
 Hempstead a village near this area    
 where his father was an Innkeeper.    
 The Sampfords was one of his local    
 haunts.  As a young man he was        
 apprenticed to a butcher.  He joined a
 gang of local thieves and stole farm  
 animals and deer.  He was first       
 arrested for stealing a cow and calf. 
 On escaping from custody he joined a  
 band of robbers.  He worked with Tom  
 King as a highwayman, robbing everyone
 who travelled on the highways between 
 London and Cambridge.  He eventually  
 killed King in London in an argument  
 with a constable, when King           
 accidentally got in the way.  He fled 
 to Yorkshire where he set up a horse  
 dealing business under a false name.  
 He was finally arrested in York for   
 horse stealing and hanged.            </content>
