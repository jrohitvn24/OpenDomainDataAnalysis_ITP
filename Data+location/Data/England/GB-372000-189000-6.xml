		<title>06KINGSWOOD VILLAGE SHOW</title>
		<content>  In Kingswood, in the middle of       
 September, it is traditional to have a
 show day. This takes place at the     
 village hall and on the playing field 
 next to it. The most important part is
 the classic car show. Many people come
 and show off their old cars. This     
 year,just for fun, there was also a   
 lawn-mower display when peole drove   
 their lawn-mowers round in circles.   
 There are side shows and stalls on the
 playing field, like "Win A Teddy", a  
 tin can shy, White Elephant, tombola  
 and skittles.                         
  In the village hall, there are       
 various shows: there are competitions 
 for children and prizes for three     
 different age groups. There is a show 
 for the Women's Institute and a       
 vegetable show. There is a knitting   
 show, a calligraphy show, a picture   
 show and a toy show.                  </content>
