		<content>{MAY DAY CELEBRATIONS                  
 On May Bank Holiday Monday every year 
 there is always a special event organ-
 ised by The School Association and    
 held in Legbourne Village Hall.The May
 Queen who has been chosen from the    
 fourth year girls of Legbourne School 
 is crowned by the retiring Queen.In   
 1985 the retiring Queen was Lucy      
 Sturman and the new Queen was Lisa    
 Slingsby.The school children sang     
 songs of "The Good Old Days". There   
 are stalls like cake, plant and       
 clothes stalls and there are plenty of
 games like a treasure hunt,guess      
 how many sweets in a jar and a raffle 
 for people to spend their money on.   
 Tea and cakes are served.Proceeds are 
 spent on buying extras for the school.
 The weather is usually too cold for   
 Maypole Dancing so that is usually    
 performed on the school's Open Day.   </content>
