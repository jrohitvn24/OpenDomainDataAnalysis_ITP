 A village of about 20 houses          
surrounding a village green with the   
church of St Peter and St Felix        
dominating one side. The village is a  
cul de sac with only one entrance from 
the main road which runs close by.     
The village has a preservation order   
on it as have most of the houses.      
 Grammar School House, next to the     
church, was built in 1556 as a day     
school for local boys, two floors of   
the house were left for the aged of the
parish. A house for the schoolmater was
incorporated into the building. The    
house is now divided into two parts,one
half being let out as a private        
dwelling, the other half rented as a   
holiday home. The schoolroom is now    
used as a village hall.
