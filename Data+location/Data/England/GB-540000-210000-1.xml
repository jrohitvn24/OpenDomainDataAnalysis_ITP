		<content> The area of our survey covers the     
 three original villages of Roydon,    
 Eastwick and Little Parndon. In 1947  
 Harlow Development Corporation was set
 up and by 1960 Little Parndon village 
 had disappeared into the new town of  
 Harlow and had given its name to the  
 Little Parndon neighbourhood.         
 When we first drove round our area we 
 noticed that it was mainly countryside
 under farming and we saw two grain    
 crops being grown - wheat and barley -
 and vegetable crops included potatoes,
 peas and broad beans.                 
 There are many trees in our area both 
 in country and town. Harlow was always
 a well wooded area thanks to the work 
 put in by farmers in the 19th century 
 and to Sir Frederick Gibberd who      
 planned Harlow and preserved as many  
                                       
                                       </content>
