		<content> God made many lovely things,          
 Flowers,sunsets and trees.            
 And after all these he made something 
 more true,                            
 Parents, children,me and you.         
                                       
 Life is not such a bad thing 'cos when
 we're older we'll be buying gold and  
 diamond rings.                        
 Women are sweet,just like honey,      
 If you choose the wrong one you'll end
 up with no money.                     
 Then you'll have to find another,     
 And with any luck she'll be a mother. 
                                       
 Some times life is very bad,          
 And nine times out of ten it ends up  
 sad.                                  
 When people die other people cry,but  
 life isn't that bad even though people
 are sad.                              
                                       </content>
