		<title>08Recreation at the Hurn.</title>
		<content> Holbeach Hurn is the only village in  
 our block.People have to come here,or 
 one of the other local villages or go 
 to Holbeach or further for recreation.
 Holbeach Hurn has a large grass       
 playing field with a football         
 pitch.There is a play area for        
 children with a sandpit,swings,a slide
 and a swingboat.There is a tennis     
 court paid for by a local farmer      
 in 1976 and presented to the          
 village.Two villagers have swimming   
 pools and residents sometimes get to  
 use them.There is a youth club for the
 over-8s,and Friendship club for       
 over-60s.The membership is never very 
 big because after retirement many     
 people leave the village although     
 there are 6 purpose built old folks   
 bungalows.For any organised groups    
 like Scouts and Guides you have to go 
 out of the area.                      </content>
