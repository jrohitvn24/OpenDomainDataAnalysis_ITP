		<title>07THE BUTTER CROSS NR.ALVELEY</title>
		<content> Near Alveley there is a rough stone   
 pillar about 2 metres high.The top is 
 circular in shape.Inside the          
 circle there is a design in the shape 
 of a cross with triangles at each end 
 of the cross.The pillar is fixed into 
 a round base made of the same kind of 
 sandstone.There are some engravings on
 the pillar and they include the       
 initials WWT.It is known as the Butter
 Cross and it has a very interesting   
 history.It is said that in the 17th   
 Century the people in Bridgnorth      
 caught the Great Plague.Alveley,in    
 those days,sold butter to             
 Bridgnorth.To avoid catching the      
 plague the Alveley farmers left their 
 butter at the cross and walked away   
 while the Bridgnorth people collected 
 it and left their money in bowls of   
 disinfectant.So the Butter Cross saved
 the people of Alveley from the plague.</content>
