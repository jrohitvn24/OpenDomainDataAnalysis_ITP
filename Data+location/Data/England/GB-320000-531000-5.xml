		<content>{BOUNDARY WALKS}started in the Middle  
 Ages.                                 
 The {'beating the bounds'}expression  
 came from when the parents used to    
 beat their children to make them know 
 where their boundary was.             
 In those days the church took 10% of  
 the farmer's crops, so they needed to 
 know where their land began and ended.
 Also if you were not in Bassenthwaite 
 Parish you could not claim any money  
 from the church if you were poor.     
 On the walk, the procession of people 
 would stop at certain trees, and a    
 priest would say a sermon for the     
 crops.                                
 This took place during the rogation   
 days between Easter and Ascension day.
 Our last Boundary Walk was in 1974 and
 is due to take place again this year  
 (1985). It is hoped to repeat the walk
 every 10 years.                       </content>
