		<title>07Keswick's Century Theatre</title>
		<content> The Century Theatre was built in 1950 
 in Yorkshire.It was designed to travel
 from place to place giving a          
 performance where ever it stopped.It  
 travelled around Lancashire before it 
 moved further afield and came to      
 travel around Cumbria.The Century     
 Theatre stopped in Keswick in 1960    
 because it is a very attractive       
 place.The Century Theatre doesn't get 
 much support from locals but it does  
 from tourists.It isn't a very         
 profitable theatre but the chairman   
 thinks it would be if it was a fixed  
 theatre and if the admission charge   
 was more.There is talk about a new    
 theatre being built on the site of the
 derelict station but it wouldn't be   
 a very good place because hardly      
 anyone would see it.The theatre is    
 made from metal and alloy.It seats 225
 people and has 4 fire exits.          </content>
