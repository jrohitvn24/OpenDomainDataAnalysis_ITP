		<content>{WYLAM SUMMER FAYRE                    
  This fayre is held annually around   
 mid-June on Wylam Jubilee Field. It   
 holds a three mile fun-run, stalls,   
 display tents and an enclosed area in 
 the middle of the field which is used 
 for several displays, e.g. Keep fit   
 girls, Scottish pipers and Highland   
 dancers. Most of the stalls are run by
 local organizations to provide finance
 for them.(see photograph a)
