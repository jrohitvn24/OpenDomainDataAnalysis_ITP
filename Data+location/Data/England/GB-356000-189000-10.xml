		<content> The White Hart Inn is the only public 
 house in Littleton which remains      
 today.It was originally a sixteenth   
 century farmhouse and retains many of 
 the features of an inn of bygone      
 days.The White Hart is very much the  
 focal point of social life in the     
 village and among its facilities is a 
 skittle alley.However,its also boasts 
 a fine restaurant which attracts not  
 only the lunchtime businessman but    
 evening diners from further afield.It 
 also has a large attractive garden.One
 of its claims to fame is that it was  
 the first pub in the world to stock   
 Baileys.
