		<title>08THE EPSOM DERBY</title>
		<content>{Epsom}is synonymous with the{Derby,}  
 most important of the five annual flat
 horse-racing{"Classics".}This was     
 first run in 1780,and is now one of   
 the country's leading sporting events.
 It is run in June, over a mile and a  
 half of the{Epsom Downs course,}which 
 features the famous{Tattenham Corner} 
 turn. (The{Oaks,}another Classic,is   
 run on the same course a few days     
 later). The{Derby}is always attended  
 by Royalty,and attracts huge crowds   
 who gather around the imposing{Grand- 
{stand.}Controversially,new fencing has
 been introduced to prevent the        
 traditional{free view}of the race.    
                                       
 Here are some{children's impressions  
 of the scene on the morning of the big
 race,after having walked around the   
 fair and the open market;and having   
 met some of the large,friendly crowd. </content>
