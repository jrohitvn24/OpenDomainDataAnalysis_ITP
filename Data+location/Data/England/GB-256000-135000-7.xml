		<content> One of the traditions in Shirwell is  
 the{Shirwell Show}in which people     
 enter their vegetables, flowers,      
 pictures and paintings to see if they 
 can win a prize.                      
   There is a tea provided but if you  
 are fourteen or over you have to pay  
 a sum of about 60 pence for the food. 
   There is also Sports included in the
 show like the egg and spoon race or   
 the long distance run and lots more.  
   At the end of the show all the cups 
 and other prizes that have been won   
 are given out to the winners.  In the 
 evening there is a clay pigeon        
 shoot for the adults. After this there
 is sometimes a short dog show where   
 the dogs are made to look good and do 
 tricks and the best dog wins a        
 rosette.
