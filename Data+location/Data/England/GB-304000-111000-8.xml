		<title>08PARISH HALL, UFFCULME</title>
		<content>{  Uffculme Parish Hall}was built on   
 land (Magelake Meadow) which was      
 donated to the village by Thomas Brice
 in 1943 .The hall was built by        
 voluntary labour from the Village with
 County grants and through much local  
 fundraising. The building was         
 completed in 1977.                    
    It is now used as a hall for       
 Village activities such as  dances,   
 discos and wedddings and it is also   
 used regularly by the Mums and        
 Toddlers Group. It has a kitchen,     
 committee/bar room, changing rooms and
 a large car park. The attached sports 
 ground means that it doubles as       
 changing rooms and tea room for       
 cricket and football teams. Weekly    
 Bingo sessions supplement income.     
 There is much potential for future    
 expansion in conjunction with Village 
 sports teams as a club house/amienity.</content>
