		<title>04Clay Mining</title>
		<content> Ball clay has been mined in this area 
 since the 18th century, when it was   
 used for clay pipes. Originally owned 
 by Pike Bros., it became part of      
{English China Clays}in 1971. With 200 
 employees working on mining and       
 processing, it is an important local  
 industry. Of the six workings here,   
 half are underground and half         
 open-cast - a cheaper system.  Pits   
 are backfilled as they are exhausted  
 rather than, as previously, being left
 to fill with water.                   
                                       
 Miners can indentify the best clay by 
 chewing it. Clay from this region is  
 no longer used as much for pottery,   
 but is sold in powder form for the    
 manufacture of tiles, sanitary ware,  
 animal feed and even some chocolates!
