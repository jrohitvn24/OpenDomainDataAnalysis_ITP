		<title>10NEWHAVEN AS A TOURIST CENTRE</title>
		<content> It is estimated that one million      
 tourists pass through Newhaven each   
 year.  The town is seen as either an  
 entry or exit point: people leave     
 Newhaven to go to various destinations
 on the Continent while others come    
 into Newhaven to visit other parts of 
 Sussex and England.  Although Newhaven
 is not regarded as an important       
 tourist centre, it does offer         
 facilities for tourists such as guest 
 houses and hotels and is an ideal base
 for visiting the surrounding area.  It
 has good rail and bus services to     
 London, Lewes, Brighton and           
 Eastbourne.  The fort, built in 1868  
 to protect Newhaven against the       
 French, is a popular attraction, as is
 the sandy beach near the West Pier.
