		<content> WHILST THERE IS A WIDE AGE SPAN AMONG 
 THE POPULATION, THERE ARE MANY ELDERLY
 RETIRED PEOPLE, AND MIDDLE-AGED PEOPLE
 WHO HAVE BEEN MADE REDUNDANT OR TAKEN 
 EARLY RETIREMENT. PART OF THE         
 POPULATION IS STATIC: FAMILIES HAVING 
 LIVED IN THE SAME AREA FOR GENERATIONS
 AND OFTEN THREE GENERATIONS OF A      
 FAMILY WILL LIVE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER. 
 SOME OF THE POPULATION IS MORE MOBILE 
 BUYING THE SMALL TERRACED HOUSES AS   
 STARTER HOMES AND MOVING WHEN         
 FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOW TO MORE 
 EXPENSIVE HOUSES.                     
 THE POPULATION ALSO COVERS A WIDE SPAN
 OF SOCIAL CLASSES. THE POPULATION OF  
 MARGROVE PARK, CHARLTON, SLAPEWATH,   
 AYSDALE GATE IS PREDOMINANTLY WORKING 
 CLASS, BUT STANGHOW HAS A MORE MIDDLE 
 CLASS POPULATION.
