		<content> People come to live in Offords and    
 Great Paxton because they are         
 quiet,peaceful villages,close to the  
 A1 road for those who need to travel. 
 There is quite a lot of movement      
 within the Great Paxton mainly due to 
 job changes or promotions. There are  
 often houses for sale as people who   
 move live on the estate.The older     
 village houses do not change ownership
 so often.There is not so much movement
 in the Offords as people from these   
 villages work more locally.The Offords
 have a shop, post office,garage,      
 village hall and Churches.There is a  
 large fruit depot in Offord which     
 employs people.
