		<title>06SYKE ESTATE AND SYKE POND</title>
		<content> When we went to Syke Estate we took   
 a drink with us because it was a hot  
 and sunny day.We looked carefully at  
 the housing and the types of shops    
 that there were.We saw some cottages  
 and some old people's homes.          
  The houses were mainly terraced and  
 many of them were shaded by trees.    
 There was only one shop that was open.
 We met a man with a very old and rusty
 car. He said that he liked living in  
 Syke because it is not near to the    
 town centre and there is some         
 beautiful countryside nearby.         
  We went to visit Syke pond and drew  
 pictures of it because it was so      
 attractive. There are two buses that  
 go to Syke, the 441 and the 442.We had
 a last look at the pond and then we   
 made our way back to school.
