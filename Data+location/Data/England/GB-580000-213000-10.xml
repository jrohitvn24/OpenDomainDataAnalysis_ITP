		<title>10CHANGES IN WITHAM IN 20TH C.</title>
		<content> 1919-1920 CRITTALL FACTORY            
 Crittalls made metal windows.The first
 factory was in Braintree, and the     
 second was set up in Witham. "The men 
 came back from the War and went into  
 Crittalls.."                          
 " You take the money I was earning at 
 Crittalls-over Â£1 a day- well the     
 average wage was about 15 to 18 bob   
 outside, -he made Witham, didn't he,  
 Crittall."                            
 Since 1945                            
 Electrification of the railway cut    
 down the journey time to London       
 enabling people to go there to work.  
  In 1928 the journey took about 80    
 minutes and only three trains left for
 London between 7 &amp; 9 am.Now it takes  
 about 45 minutes and 14 trains leave  
 in that time.Estates at Moat farm and 
 Dorothy Sayers Drive were built for   
 Commuters.                            </content>
