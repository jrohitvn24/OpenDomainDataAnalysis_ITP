		<content>  The English have somehow won a name  
 for being animal lovers. The children 
 of Grange Junior School carried out a 
 survey to see how true this is so far 
 as Tuffley is concerned.              
  About 200 families are represented in
 the School and 176 of them keep at    
 least one pet. It was expected that   
 cats and dogs would be at the top of  
 the list. There were 111 cats and 82  
 dogs, but the greatest number was     
 reported for birds (127). Of the      
 "traditional" pets, rabbits (50),     
 guinea pigs (33) and hamsters (27)    
 came next.                            
  The less usual pets noted included   
 snakes, tarantulas, crabs, terrapins, 
 ponies and a frog.                    
  Did the family calling their two eels
 pets, first catch them as elvers - and
 then had second thoughts about frying 
 them?                                 </content>
