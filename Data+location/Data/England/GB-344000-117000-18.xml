		<title>18Fire Station, Martock</title>
		<content>     Twenty part time firemen work in  
 the Fire Station and are called by a  
 radio bleeping system. The firemen    
 have to leave what they are doing at  
 least 180 times a year. 6 firemen are 
 in a fire engine at a time but there  
 are only three breathing apparatus.   
 If it is a house fire two applicances 
 are sent but when it is a chimney fire
 or car fire only one appliance is     
 sent. Sometimes when all three        
 appliances at Yeovil are out at a     
 fire, our appliances have to go to    
 Yeovil.  On each fire engine there is 
 a water tender, ladder and a pump that
 will pump 2250 litres of water per    
 minute. One of the ladders on the fire
 engine is 10.5 metres long and the    
 other is 13.5 metres.  In the fire    
 engine they keep fittings for the 16  
 length hose that fits inside a        
 compartment.                          </content>
