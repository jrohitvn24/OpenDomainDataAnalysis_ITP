		<content>  Mr. Smith a dairy farmer owns        
 Belleisle and farms 300 acres of land 
 quarter of a mile away. He has 85     
 dairy cows and 2 bulls. One bull is a 
 Hereford and the other a Freisian,a   
 bull would cost around Â£1,000. Each   
 bull weighs 12-15 cwt.                
  In the morning Mr. Smith gets up at  
 6:00am to milk the cows,he milks them 
 twice a day ,at 6:15am and 4:30pm. In 
 his special milking shed he can fit 16
 cows at a time,8 at each side. He has 
 a man to help him.                    
  In the spring he cuts the grass and  
 the baler puts it into bales. He has a
 container which turns the hay into    
 silage which will be used to feed the 
 cattle in winter.                     
  Mr. Smith's life is tedious and hard.
