   Colesbourne Park has been owned for 
 nearly 200 years,by the Elwes family. 
{Mr.H.J.Elwes}F.R.S.,a great traveller,
 collected and planted many trees in   
 the park and created the arboretum.   
 There are about 222 different trees   
 some of which have never been grown in
 Great Britain before.The rarest tree  
 is the{Pterocarya rhoifoli}Japanese   
 Wingnut.The present owner Mr.H.J.Elwes
 is maintaining and adding to the      
 arboretum.                            
   The house originally stood next to  
 the church this was knocked down about
 1851 by John Elwes.A large Victorian  
 mansion was built with many new things
 such as  cast iron girders,lifts and  
 a type of central heating.This house  
 was demolished and a new house built  
 on the site in 1958.One large room    
 remains of the Victorian house.       </content>
