		<content>                                       
 The only Post Office in the area was  
built about 53 years ago and is also a 
General Store selling food,vegetables, 
sweets, tobacco,cards,stationery,and   
other everyday items. It does a very   
good trade and is run by the owner and 
his wife and they employ one or two    
other people who live in the Village.  
 The shop opens at 9.00a.m. and closes 
at 6.00p.m. every weekday and shuts at 
1.00p.m. on Saturdays. On Sunday, the  
shop is closed all day.                
 The owner is also a Councillor, who   
sits on the local Parish Council to    
represent the village of Beck Row. He  
is also one of the trustees for the    
Village Hall.
