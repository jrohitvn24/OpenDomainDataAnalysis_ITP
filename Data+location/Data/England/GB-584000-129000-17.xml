		<content>   I get up at 7.30 a.m.  My bedroom   
 has 3 posters of "Wham!" on the walls.
 After washing I put on my school      
 uniform. Most of the children at my   
 school wear school uniform but you    
 don't have to.                        
{  I like toast and jam for breakfast  
{with fruit juice or a cup of tea. }   
   At 8.30 I get my bike and cycle up  
 to school from the Layne. There are   
 about 60 children at our school but   
 only three of us ride our bikes.      
{  When we arrive at school we put our 
{bags in, then play in the playground. 
{When I walk in the playground I wonder
{if the boys are playing football and  
{they usually are.}                    
   At 9 o'clock one of the teachers    
 blows a whistle and we go into school.
 Our work is usually different each    
 day. This morning we did a maths test.
 We stop for dinnertime at 12 o'clock. </content>
