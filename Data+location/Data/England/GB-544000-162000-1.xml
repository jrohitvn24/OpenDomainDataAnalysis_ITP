		<content>The south-eastern outskirts of the     
London Borough of Bromley is an        
attractive residential area,           
interspersed with green belt land.The  
villages of Farnborough,Pratts Bottom  
and Green Street Green provide a       
distinct,but individual,character,and  
enjoy a variety of local activities.   
Orpington and Bromley are the nearest  
towns,and many people commute to London
for business. The interests of the area
are served by councillors who attend   
meetings at Bromley Town Hall,the      
centre of local government,and local   
residents' associations are also very  
active.The area sends representatives  
to the Greater London Council,although 
this is due to be abolished in 1986.   
Altogether this is a popular and       
pleasant area,with good amenities      
within easy distance.
