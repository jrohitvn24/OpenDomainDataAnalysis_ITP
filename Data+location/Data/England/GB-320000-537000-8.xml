 My favourite playground game is Tiggy 
 on Lines.It is played with a group of 
 children.You have two catchers        
 standing beside a wall.They count to  
 ten and then they run after everybody 
 else.You can only run along the lines 
 on the playground.If they touch       
 you,you are caught.When you are caught
 you have to put your hand up on the   
 wall where the catchers counted to    
 ten.There are only two ways you can   
 get off the wall. If sombody goes     
 under your arm but that isn't likely. 
 The most likely thing to happen is    
 that the person guarding will step    
 over one particular line that is out  
 of his bounds that means all people on
 the wall are off.That means the game  
 starts again.
