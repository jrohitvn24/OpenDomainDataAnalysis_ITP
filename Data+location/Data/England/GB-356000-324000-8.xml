		<content> ARABLE FARMING                        
 By far the largest usage of land in   
 the Stanton area of Shroposhire is    
 farming and in our particular area of 
 study, it splits fairly evenly three  
 ways between livestock, arable crops  
 and forestry. There was quite a       
 diversity of of crops grown, and the  
 fields are generally not large by     
 modern standards.  Oats and barley    
 were all in evidence, not as ripe as  
 one would have expected due we are    
 sure to the poor weather this year so 
 far.  The other  crops we saw were    
 peas potatoes and oil seed rape.  It  
 appears that the peas are sold direct 
 for processing, the maincrop potatoes 
 are transported to the wholesale      
 market at Wolverhampton or Birmingham.
 Oil seed rape is grown for two        
 reasons, as a cattle feed and to      
 nitrogenise the soil.                 </content>
