 reclaimed land, either mixed wood or  
 farmland.Just before the village on   
 the south side there are some boarding
 kennels for dogs, gun dogs are also   
 trained here. The population of       
 Brigstock is approx 1137, the         
 buildings are a mixture of old and    
 new. There are many thatched cottages 
 and the road through the village is   
 narrow and twisting. (A new bypass is 
 planned).To the north of Brigstock is
