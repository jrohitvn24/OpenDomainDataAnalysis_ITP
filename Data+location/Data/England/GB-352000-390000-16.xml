		<title>16OUR FAVOURITE SHOPS</title>
		<content> Lee's favourite shop is:-             
 "...Thatto Cycles.  It is a B.M.X.    
 shop and it has lots of things in it  
 like bicycle frames and forks.  They  
 also sell handlebars, cables, blocks, 
 number plates, wheel plates and       
 helmets.  When it is my birthday I    
 always go there to buy something.     
 When I go there I buy stickers e.g.,  
 Skyway.  You can have your bike       
 sprayed any colour there.             
 Philip's favourite shop is:-          
 "..'Wong's Chinese Take Away'.... they
 sell chips, fish, chicken, peas and   
 curry.  The food is put into cardboard
 trays so that we can eat it at        
 home....It is called a take-away shop.
 Paul's favourite shop is Partco where 
 they sell parts for motorcars, e.g.,  
 steering wheels, clutches,brakes,     
 fan-belts and batteries.
