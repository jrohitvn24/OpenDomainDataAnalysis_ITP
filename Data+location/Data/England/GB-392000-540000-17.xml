        In Rookhope there is a park. It
 is not a very big one. It has swings, 
 a slide and a rocking horse.          
        In summer we go to a place     
 called Risby where you can swim. It is
 about three miles from Rookhope.      
 Sometimes , if you do not want to go  
 swimming, you can sit on the grass and
 watch.                                
        If you want to go to the       
 swimming baths, the nearest one to    
 Rookhope is at Stanhope.              
        Every June we have a Carnival  
 and we all get dressed up. Some people
 go on floats while others walk.       
        On Christmas Eve Santa comes to
 the village in a horse box to give    
 presents to the children.
