		<title>19SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN SPILSBY</title>
		<content> The county council is considering     
 making changes in secondary education,
 because the birth rate is falling.We  
 interviewed Mr Gourd the head master  
 of King Edward V1 Grammar School.We   
 asked him what he thought the council 
 dicision on secondary Schools would   
 be. He thought they would merge the   
 Grammar School with Alford and keep a 
 Secondary Modern School in Spilsby,but
 he was fighting for a Comprehensive   
 with a Grammar stream.We next asked   
 him why he thought we should still    
 keep a Secondary School in Spilsby.He 
 said because it provided education and
 also people won't have to move out of 
 town or lose their jobs.If the schools
 close the teachers would be offered   
 other jobs or be given early          
 retirement.He thought Grammar School  
 buildings would be needed by a bigger 
 Franklin School.                      </content>
