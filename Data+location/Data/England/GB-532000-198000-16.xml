		<title>16RECREATION IN ENFIELD</title>
		<content> In Enfield there are a few parks but  
 the biggest is Whitewebbs. The best   
 park for fishing is Hilly Fields      
 because Turkey Brook runs through it. 
 Whitewebbs has a 'pitch 'n' put'      
 course and an 18 hole golf course.    
 Hilly Fields is a lovely park mostly  
 used for dog walking. It has no       
 amusements such as swings and slides  
 but it has a brook running along the  
 valley in the middle. There are some  
 lovely trees and steep hills with a   
 few trees on them. In Winter these    
 hills and slopes are used for sledging
 and skiing. Tuckers is also a park but
 is quite a contrast to Hilly Fields.  
 There are lots of swings and slides.  
 There are sports pitches including    
 soccer and rounders.
