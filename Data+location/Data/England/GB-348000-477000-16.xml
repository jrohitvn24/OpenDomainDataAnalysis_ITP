		<title>16Beetham W.I.</title>
		<content> Founded in 1918, Beetham is the second
 oldest W.I. in Westmorland, and still 
 has one of the original members.      
 They have always had a reputation for 
 a very high standard of craft work.   
 Several members excel in the rural    
 crafts of basketry, spinning, knitting
 and woodwork.                         
    They meet monthly in the village   
 school, and a wide variety of subjects
 is included in the yearly syllabus,   
 ranging from talks on antiques, old   
 silver, and interesting travel        
 programmes, to old and modern         
 cookery techniques and the use of     
 micro-wave ovens. Musical evenings are
 particularly popular, and they still  
 sing "Jerusalem" with real fervour.   
    They support the Westmorland Show, 
 take care of the War Memorial, and    
 assist in the preservation of the     
 church.                               </content>
