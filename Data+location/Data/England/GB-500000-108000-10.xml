		<title>10A HERDSMAN OF OFFHAM, SUSSEX</title>
		<content> The farm at Offham, near Arundel is   
 run by a herdsman, his wife, elder    
 daughter, and when not at school, a   
 younger daughter. The tenant farmer   
 lives elsewhere. This family works    
 seven days a week, all day. They never
 have a holiday for 'someone must      
 always be on hand'. Only the youngster
 gets a break - a week with Granny in  
 Worthing. The farm has eighty head of 
 cattle, which are taken down the lane,
 over the occupation bridge, to graze  
 beside the Arun. The husband has a    
 car, the women use bikes. Offham has  
 neither church nor shop nor social    
 activity. Television and the phone are
 their link-line. The wife seemed      
 content to talk though obviously on   
 her way to the sheds. 'Those who live 
 here like it quiet - we love it, we   
 couldn't live different, - it's so    
 very peaceful.'                       </content>
