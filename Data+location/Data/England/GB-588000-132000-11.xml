		<content> I live in Bethersden but go to school 
 in Tenterden because my dad thinks    
 it's a better place to go. I am woken 
 up at about 8 o'clock but most        
 mornings I don't feel too great about 
 getting up (most people don't so I bet
 you know how I feel).Breakfast time   
 and I have crunchy nut cornflakes, a  
 cup of tea and some apple juice. Then 
 dad takes me to school in our car. I  
 can't tell you much about the drive to
 school because I'm normally half      
 asleep and don't notice that much.    
 Then it's into school as cheerful as  
 usual.After registration it's time for
 assembly where we pray and sing hymns.
 Mr. Weaver sings his heart out and I  
 try to sing over his loud voice which 
 is hard.Then it's back to our         
 classroom to "good old Mr. Whitcombe" 
 with some lovely gems of work for us  
 to do.      {(continued)              </content>
