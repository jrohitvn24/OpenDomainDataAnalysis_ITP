		<title>12SPORTS CENTRE CARSHALTON SRY</title>
		<content> Westcroft was opened in l977. Classes 
 of instruction can be run for any     
 sport, provided sufficient people     
 attend. Fencing has been tried but did
 not have enough support. The most     
 popular sport in numbers is swimming. 
 On the dry side it is badminton and   
 5-a-side football.                    
   It is mostly local people who use   
 the pool. A survey was undertaken some
 while ago and most people who attend  
 live no more than about 3 miles away. 
 The most people travel is up to ten   
 miles.                                
   One of the growth areas at the      
 centre are the birthday parties. 646  
 were held last year.                  
   An outdoor play area is being built 
 for volley ball, 5_a_side football,   
 tennis and netball. It was decided not
 to build extra squash courts as squash
 is no longer the popular sport it was.</content>
