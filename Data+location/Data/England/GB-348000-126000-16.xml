   During June 1985 BBC television have
 been shooting a film in Somerton _ The
 Monocled Mutineer which tells the     
 story of a mutiny among British troops
 at a Tranisit Camp in France during   
 the 1st World War because of harsh    
 discipline before they were sent to   
 the Front Line.Somerton was turned    
 into Etaples, the French town.The     
 Globe Inn was turned into a telegraph 
 office and cafe.A false front was put 
 across the road to form another cafe. 
 The memorial soldier in the square was
 transformed into a Town Clock and the 
 streets were covered with shavings and
 false cobbles. For more than a week   
 extras dressed as peasants and British
 soldiers acted different scenes.      
   Many spectators came to watch the   
 filming in progress.
