		<title>18Acton Church Brass.</title>
		<content>  In Acton Church is the third         
earliest full length brass effigy in   
England.It is of Sir Robert de Bures,  
(1302)and shows a figure dressed in    
chain mail, partly covered by a sur    
coat.He is wearing a sword and spurs   
and carrying  a shield bearing his     
coat of arms.At his feet is a lion,    
which is the symbol of courage. Sir    
Robert held land in 15 Suffolk         
villages.It was acquired through       
marriage as well as being land which   
is held by defeated rebel nobelmen     
and given to him by King Edward 2nd.   
The brass has become so popular for    
brass rubbing that a copy has been     
made.
