		<content>The area is depressing, due to the     
empty houses, graffitti and general    
neglect. Most of the houses are owned  
by the local Borough Council. Some     
people have bought their house from the
council.There is a large estate of     
flats in Shepherds Bush called "The    
White City Estate". Here most of the   
flats are up to ten stories high, with 
two or three bedrooms. There is nowhere
for the children to play.The "Old Oak" 
estate and the "Wormholt" and "Flowers"
estate consist of small houses, quite  
closly gathered together.Some of these 
houses are derelict,but some of them   
have been modernised and people take   
pride in them.In East Acton there is   
one new development, built by          
Barrats,the building company.They are  
flats and are giving a new dimension to
the area.
