		<title>01SUMMARY OF AREA.</title>
		<content> Our area lies between Widnes, St.     
 Helens and Warrington. Widnes is the  
 closest, it's boundary actually       
 runs through our area. Despite this,  
 of our 12 square kilometers, only two 
 are built upon. The remainder are     
 farmed. Lying where it does, it is    
 inevitable that roads here will carry 
 much traffic and this is the case on  
 the two parallel major roads that run 
 east/west roughly 1/3 and 2/3 down our
 block. There is evidence of recession 
 and economies in that one of the two  
 railways is derelict and there are    
 areas of industrial dereliction both  
 around existing factories and on      
 abandoned sites, although these are   
 small. In summary, the block is mainly
 low-lying rural land which contains   
 two distinct urban areas whose spread 
 is limited by county boundaries.
