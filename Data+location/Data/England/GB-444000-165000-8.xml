		<title>08CRAFTY CRAFT RACE NEWBURY</title>
		<content> The Crafty Craft Race is an annual    
 event for home made rafts which look  
 rather like carnival floats on        
 water.Crafts have names such as 'The  
 Ark','Captain Hook 'and 'Sunken       
 Electricity'.The idea is to get your  
 boat from a given starting place to   
 Newbury as quickly as possible.There  
 are two different events.The          
 funrunners have to row six and a half 
 miles from Kintbury and the real      
 racers have to row eight and a half   
 miles from Hungerford.The use of the  
 locks is not allowed and competitors  
 have to carry the craft along the     
 towpath before putting it back in the 
 water.                                
 The race begins at 9.30 am.and the    
 last boats arrive at about 3.00 pm.The
 race ends at The Wharf where there is 
 a fair and barbecue                   
 .                                     </content>
