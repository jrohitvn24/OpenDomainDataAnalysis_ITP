		<title>03A WALK IN THE SEISDON AREA</title>
		<content>   A public footpath runs the length of
Abbot's Castle Hill and affords very   
good views of the land on either side, 
mainly a patchwork of different        
coloured fields, bounded by hedges,    
with the occasional house or group of  
cottages dotted about the landscape.   
More distant views take in the         
villages of Seisdon, Trysull and       
Wombourne and the western side of      
Wolverhampton.                         
   In another direction Pattingham     
village shows  up well, the Wrekin can 
usually be seen and even the Long Mynd 
on clear days.                         
   On the middle of the ridge stands a 
house called "Tinker's Castle".   At   
one time its wine cellar was a cave    
occupied by a so-called "hermit"       
who was actually a knife-grinder by    
trade and a herbalist who supplied the 
lcal girls with love potions.          </content>
