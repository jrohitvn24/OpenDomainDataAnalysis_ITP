Adbaston's Jubilee club has 39 members 
who meet monthly. Offley Hay's Over    
Sixties Club has 60 members meeting    
fortnightly. Activities are similar at 
both, consisting of exchanging news,   
listening to talks, looking at a slide 
show, playing cards or doing craft     
work. Funding comes from an auction of 
gifts, a raffle at each meeting, and by
donations from local pubs. The Jubilee 
Club also receives a donation from     
Cadbury's Foods Ltd., while the Over   
Sixties Club holds an annual Ploughmans
Lunch. The funds pay for three annual  
outings and a Christmas lunch for the  
members. Some younger people help to   
run each club and provide transport for
meetings.
