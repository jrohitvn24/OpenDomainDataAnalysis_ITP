		<title>01A general review of the area</title>
		<content>The area  we  looked  at is  mainly    
farmland -much of it is used as managed
grassland.The River Churnet flows      
through the bottom left hand section of
our area,cutting quite a deep valley   
with tree-covered sides.               
About a quarter of our area is owned by
a local factory owner.His wife lives at
Wootton Lodge and their grounds spread 
over into three of the kilometre       
squares-with lakes and woods and       
parklands.The main village in the area 
is Ellastone-with a population of      
about 250.This village lies in the     
valley of the River Dove.Ellastone is  
a village that spreads-It is not a     
compact village.                       
There is very little industry in the   
area-only a small engineering factory  
and a stone mason.Recently younger     
people have moved out and older people 
are moving into the village.T          </content>
