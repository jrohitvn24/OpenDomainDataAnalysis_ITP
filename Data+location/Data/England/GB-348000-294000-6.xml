		<title>06A RURAL CONSTABLE IN APEDALE</title>
		<content>                                       
   Police work,in a rural area, means  
 that there is no such thing as a      
 typical day.Today,my duty started at  
 9am.when I phoned my local Head-      
 quarters for orders.My first job took 
 me to a farm where I inspected the    
 land to see if it is suitable for a   
 firearm to be used there.I am also    
 required to approve applicant--is he  
 suitable for possession of a weapon?  
 My chat with him over a cup of tea is 
 interupted by a radio instruction to  
 attend a road accident. Fortunately it
 is a minor one, without injuries, and 
 I am able to return to the office to  
 complete my paper work__a daily       
 routine and a very necessary one.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
