		<title>12POCKET MONEY</title>
		<content>                                       
 I get Â£2 a week for my pocket money.I 
 get Â£1 pocket money from my dad and   
 mum and I get some pocket money from  
 my aunt and uncle,nans and grandads.I 
 have to put 50p of it into my money   
 box and 50p of it into the bank.I have
 also got to put some of my money in   
 the jar that holds money for buyiny   
 birthday presents for my relatives and
 friends. I always have to spend my    
 money on things that are not rubbish  
 otherwise I do not get any pocket     
 money the next week.I can get some    
 extra money by doing some jobs for    
 my mum and dad,and I get some from my 
 aunt who works in one of the sweet    
 shops.I do the sweeping up in the     
 sweet shop and I get some more pocket 
 money from her.
