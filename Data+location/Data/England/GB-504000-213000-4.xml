 house,built in 1540 by R.Page.From    
 1628 the Saunders family occupied it. 
 Anna Saunders married Sir Edward      
 Sebright and later Sir Thomas altered 
 it in 1860.In world war 2 it was used 
 as a repair station for fighter planes
  It now has 100 rooms, all classrooms 
 or dormitories. Recently, a sports    
 hall and a junior wing have been      
 added.The school has a nature reserve,
 quite a large wood and extensive      
 playing fields. There are 3 tennis    
 courts, a swimming pool and a small   
 golf course. There is an old ice-house
 which was used as a shelter in the    
 war. The lovely Great Hall contains a 
 powerful organ which was the most     
 advanced electric one of its time when
 built. There are 300 boys, aged 4-13  
 in the school today, and about 6      
 girls!                                </content>
