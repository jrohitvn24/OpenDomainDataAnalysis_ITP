		<title>05LANDRAKE METHODIST CHAPEL</title>
		<content> Like many village churches today,     
 weekly attendances are low,with       
 elderly congregations.Landrake has a  
 Sunday School of over thirty children.
 Plans are in hand for altering the    
 internal structure of the chapel      
 making it smaller and warmer with     
 kitchen and toilet facilities so that 
 the building can be used more during  
 the week.                             
 Landrake Chapel is in the Saltash     
 Circuit of thirteen churches with two 
 ministers.Once a month a minister     
 takes the service,relying on local    
 preachers for other Sundays.There is  
 only one service on the Sunday except 
 for Harvest and Anniversary times.    
 Coffee mornings,bring &amp; buy and a     
 pantomine help to bring in money for  
 general funds.A summer coach trip for 
 a day at the seaside is organised,with
 the Sunday School children going free.</content>
