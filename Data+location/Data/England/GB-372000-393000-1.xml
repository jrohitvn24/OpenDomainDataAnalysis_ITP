		<title>01OUR LOCAL TIP.</title>
		<content> The tip is very near a place called De
 Brooke Pool. It is a large clay pit   
 split into two; one half is a tip.    
 Both are filled with water which is   
 very dirty and deep. Although it is   
 full of oil and rubbish, there are    
 sticklebacks, newts and frogs in      
 there.                                
  Now the tip is being filled in and   
 the rubbish buried. Soil has been     
 pushed into a big wall to divide the  
 two halves. A lot of people ride down 
 there on their bikes because there are
 some jumps for BMX riding. The tip is 
 surrounded by rough fields and unused 
 ground and is owned by Trafford       
 Borough Council.                      
  The clay has been used for brick     
 making for many years, but ages ago   
 clay was taken to build pots for      
 cooking. It may even have been used in
 the Stone Age.                        </content>
