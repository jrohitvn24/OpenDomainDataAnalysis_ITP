       The village, according to the   
 Lincolnshire Domesday Survey of 1086, 
 was originally spelled Stubetune. No  
 definitive explanation has been given 
 for this spelling.                    
       It is the second largest of our 
 three villages and in the last census 
 of 1981 had a population of 153 with  
 48 households.                        
       In the village there is a church
 and a churchyard, both in use. In the 
 churchyard there is an unusual        
 monument in the form of a broken      
 column dedicated to Sir Robert Heron  
 (died 1855) who built and lived at    
 Stubton Hall. The hall, standing in   
 its own grounds, has been extensively 
 enlarged and is now a special boarding
 school for maladjusted children and   
 funded by Lincolnshire County Council.
