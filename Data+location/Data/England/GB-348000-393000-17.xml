		<title>17Adopt-a-Gran in St.Helens</title>
		<content> Our school, Parish C.E. Primary, have 
 a scheme to help the old people who   
 live in the district.The children of  
 the fourth year go out in pairs to    
 visit one of the local 'grans'.       
   My 'gran' lives in Gleave Street.   
 When we get to her house she invites  
 us in and we sit down and have a cup  
 of tea and a biscuit. We chat about   
 all kinds of things.                  
   Sometimes on a Wednesday the 'grans'
 come in to school.They can all meet   
 and have a chat with each other over a
 cup of tea.                           
   When the scheme started we were     
 entered into a competition for the    
 B.B.C. Look Northwest Trophy. We won  
 the competition and we were on the    
 television and in the local           
 newspapers.
