		<title>08CLUTTON'S RAILWAY</title>
		<content> The last train that came to Clutton   
 was 17 years ago. The line was part of
 the Great Western Railway.A few       
 children used it to go to schools in  
 Bristol. Once a year there was a day  
 excursion to Barry Island. The station
 seemed old fashioned. There were two  
 platforms which were quite small.There
 was a tiny ticket office,toilets and a
 signal box along the line. In the     
 waiting room was a small coal fire.   
 People miss the railway even now      
 because it was so easy to travel      
 everywhere on it.                     
            {BROMILOW'S YARD           
 The disused station is now Bromilow's 
 coal and lorry yard. The company      
 provides a transport service carrying 
 containers all over the world.Amongst 
 the lorries is the Clutton carnival   
 float used every year.
