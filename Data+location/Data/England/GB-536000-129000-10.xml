		<title>10Highbrook - Bluebell Jubilee</title>
		<content> To celebrate the first 25 years of    
 this privately owned railway several  
 special events were held. Displays of 
 Fire Engines, Vintage Engines, Steam  
 Engines and Military and Vintage      
 Vehicles were arranged. A special     
 Silver Jubilee week-end took place on 
 the 3rd - 4th August which was the    
 nearest date to the 7th August 1960   
 when the first train ran. The original
 engines were used and the scene as it 
 was in 1960 was recreated. Drivers,   
 guards and station staff wore the old 
 uniforms. The final event of the year 
 will be the running of the Santa      
 Special when children have an         
 opportunity to meet Santa Claus on the
 train and receive a present. This     
 special train runs on Saturdays and   
 Sundays in December.
