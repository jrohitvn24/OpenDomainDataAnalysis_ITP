		<content> The Wellington Bomber is one of the   
 many war planes that took part in     
 World War 2.The proper name for the   
 Wellington Bomber is the Vickers      
 Wellington bomber.They would land     
 at the airport near                   
 Atherstone-on-Stour and then they     
 would tow them to the airstrip which  
 we saw at Orchard Hill Farm.They would
 tie them down to the ground on to iron
 bars,so they would not blow away or   
 bump into each other and then they    
 would throw a net over them to        
 camouflage them.This was because they 
 did not want the Germans to know it   
 was an English airfield and it would  
 not  be attacked.This aeroplane went  
 to Germany to bomb their factories    
 where they were making weapons,planes 
 and tanks to use against this country.
