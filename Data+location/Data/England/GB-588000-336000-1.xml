		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW - EGMERE AREA</title>
		<content> The region is predominantly{agricult- 
{ural}with four farms:  one of 850     
 acres, one of 650 acres, one of 720   
 acres. The other, partly in the area, 
 amounts to 700 acres. The soil is     
 mainly light and stony - suitable     
 for any cereal or root crop. All of   
 the land is under Estate ownership.   
 About a third is owned by the Wals-   
 ingham Estate Co.(Mr John Gurney) and 
 the rest by The Holkham Estate Co.    
 (Lord Leicester). The farms are       
 tenanted properties and most dwellings
 are tied cottages. It is sparsely     
 populated. There are a few patches of 
 woodland that are worked. In addition 
 the area is used for game breeding and
 shooting. The landscape is gentle and 
 undulating nature with good cover for 
 a wide range of flora and fauna.      
 Places of historical value are a      
 'lost' village and a wartime airfield.</content>
