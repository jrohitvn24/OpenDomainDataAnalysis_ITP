		<title>07The Michelin factory,Hanford</title>
		<content>The Michelin is a large tyre factory in
Hanford.This factory provides jobs for 
lots of people.My dad works in the     
factory.He has worked there for 24     
years.He puts metal wires into the     
tyres.He works shifts.Sometimes when   
I'm going to school in the morning he  
is just going to bed!                  
  Every year in the summer a race      
called the Michelin Ten takes place.My 
dad sometimes takes part in it.        
  Earlier this year the Michelin had to
make over 2,000 people redundant.Many  
people near to where I live lost their 
jobs.My dad was lucky,he is still      
working there.                         
  In my school,Boothen Primary,a       
quarter of the children have a relative
who works for the Michelin.This shows  
how important the factory is in the    
area and how terrible the effect was of
the recent job losses.                 </content>
