		<content> Two villages and nine farms, are in   
 this undulating well treed area,with  
 narrow road and clear streams. A by   
 passing dual carriageway helps to     
 maintain a peaceful quiet and neat    
 countryside.  More arable land is on  
 east, while grass and plantations are 
 more evident heading west.  Currently 
 the area is experiencing a growth of  
 'plotted' new housing,where the       
 commuters travel as far as Tyneside to
 work. Many families have been here for
 several generations and family        
 relationship  abound. The hourly bus  
 service makes a car an advantage for  
 work and other needs outside the area.
 The needs of the farming community are
 provided locally by a mart.  Repairs  
 are both within the area boundaries   
 and nearby plus services at Alnwick.
