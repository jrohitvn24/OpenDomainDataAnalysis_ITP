		<content>  For the Domesday Project our school  
 has been given a 12 kilometre square  
 block North West of Bradford. This    
 block contains: mainly farmland, two  
 dormitory villages and woodland.      
  The two villages:{Cottingley}and{    
{Wilsden}have old established village  
 centres which were extened with modern
 semi-detached houses built after the  
 Second World War .                    
  The land in this area is mainly used 
 as pasture for dairy cattle. To the   
 north of the block is a {woodland }   
 area containing deciduous and         
 evergreen trees.                      
  Within this block there is a         
{filtration plant}which supplies water 
 to most of the Bradford area.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
