		<title>19Events in Appleby</title>
		<content>    Different associations and         
 individuals join in a fancy dress     
 parade organised by the British Legion
 which is led by a brass band through  
 the streets of Appleby.We have sports 
 and teas.It is all colourful and      
 exciting.Floats and costumes may win  
 prizes.There is also a Band of Hope   
 parade every  year.                   
    Because this is a farming area     
 every year in August we have an       
 Agricultural Show where people can    
 show animals.There are tents for      
 horticultural produce,cooking,baking  
 and children's classes.               
    Gypsies have come from all over the
 country for 300 years to Appleby horse
 fair.The fair is in June and they     
 stay a week dealing in horses.Some    
 caravans are the hooped caravans.Many 
 have crystal vases and Crown Derby    
 china.    Claire Ward and Julia Dayson</content>
