		<title>09INDUSTRY TRAILER TENTS</title>
		<content>{CREIGHTON-BINNS                       
 Mr.Binns first came to Cowling about  
 ten years ago to set up a business    
 making trailer tents.When he first    
 started he had only a small part of   
 a large mill which had been used to   
 produce textiles.His workshop was only
 just large enough to make one trailer 
 tent.The rest of the mill was still   
 used for weaving.Now all the mill     
 buildings are used for this one       
 business,and include an area for      
 welding the steel for the chassis     
 Upstairs is a big sewing room,and the 
 only things not made there are the    
 wheels and jockey wheel. One of the   
 small trailers can be towed by a motor
 bike.All the trailers take only about 
 3 minutes to erect,after between 80   
 and 90 hours to construct. Eleven     
 people,including family,now work there
 Below there is an old water wheel.    </content>
