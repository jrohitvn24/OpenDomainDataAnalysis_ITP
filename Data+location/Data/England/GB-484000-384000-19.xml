		<title>19Park Spring's Estate.</title>
		<content> My cousin lives on the Park Spring's  
 Council Estsate in Gainsborough.She   
 used to live in Willingham but my     
 Uncle lost his job and had to sell his
 house last year.                      
 The estate is a mixture of terraced   
 houses and terraced flats all made    
 from the same colour brick.There is   
 only one small shop on the estate but 
 there is a very large supermarket     
 called Morrisons on the edge of the   
 estate.                               
 I do not think that I would like to   
 live on the estate as it always dirty 
 looking and there is always lots of   
 rubbish and glass lying all over the  
 place.                                
 Some of the houses look quite nice    
 because the people who live in them   
 have made their gardens look nice by  
 planting trees and bushes.Other house 
 look awful and need painting.         </content>
