		<title>13THE VILAGE POLICEMAN</title>
		<content>   St Margarets police station is on   
 the Droveway, not far from the school.
 It is a county police station with an 
 office and a police house attached.   
   The policeman's name is Steve       
 Grayland and he lives in the police   
 house with his family. His area of    
 policing is in St Margaret's and      
 Kingsdown. On a visit there we met    
 him. He seemed very friendly and      
 jovial. His main areas of work are    
 patrolling the village by foot, car or
 motor bike. He usually rides the motor
 bike.                                 
   The most crime in the area is       
 robbery and vandalism.Sometimes he has
 to call Dover CID when a robbery      
 occurs in the village.He hardly ever  
 has to use his truncheon and he said  
 that at times his job becomes quite   
 monotonous_just plodding the beat and 
 writing reports.                      </content>
