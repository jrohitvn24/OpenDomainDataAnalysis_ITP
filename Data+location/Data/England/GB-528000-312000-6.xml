		<content>  The oldest farming family we can     
 trace back are the Lawsons who live at
 Shepeau Stow and used to be the       
 millers.In the area there are 8 or 9  
 big farms.The land is farmed by a few 
 men and a lot of expensive            
 machinery.Some fertilizer,pest        
 controller and weed killer are put on 
 by tractors and some by air.Some      
 people are worried about breathing in 
 chemicals.Some people think chemicals 
 get into our food and water and don't 
 do us any good.Some of the chemicals  
 people spray on crops go on to other  
 people's crops.There is a worry that  
 we are growing too much grain and we  
 shall not know what to do with        
 it.There is a worry that machinery is 
 taking over all the jobs.People are   
 worried that we have pulled down all  
 the trees and hedges and animals have 
 nowhere to live.                      </content>
