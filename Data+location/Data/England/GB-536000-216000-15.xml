		<title>15THUNDRIDGE OLD CHURCH.</title>
		<content> The original village of Thundridge was
 a km or so east of its present        
 position. All that remains of the old 
 settlement is the ruined C15th tower  
 of the old church and what is left of 
 a C17th moated manor house called Bury
 (knocked down in 1812). The church was
 known as All Saints' and was (in 1853)
 demolished,to be replaced by the new  
 church of St. Mary,at Wadesmill. This 
 new church was built using stone from 
 All Saints',which is why so little    
 remains. The site was a popular picnic
 spot in Victorian days,but today it is
 badly overgrown. The graveyard is now 
 impossible to walk through,but we were
 able to read some of the gravestones. 
 The oldest dated back to the early    
 1700s. The tower is in a dangerous    
 state,but you can still see the C12th 
 doorway. It is a shame to see the     
 former church so badly looked after.  </content>
