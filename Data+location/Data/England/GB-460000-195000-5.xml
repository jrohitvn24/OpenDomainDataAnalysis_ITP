		<content>  Every day 150 children and 5 staff   
have a lunch cooked in the school      
canteen. The rest go home to lunch.

 There are two sittings, we sit eight  
to a table. We collect our own food    
from the dinner ladies who serve it,   
there is usually a choice of main      
course and of sweet.                   
 We like to complain about the food and
some of us would like to bring a packed
lunch to school,but nobody does because
the school lunch is very good really,  
for 65p a day.
