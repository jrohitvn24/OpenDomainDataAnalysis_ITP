		<content>    The Epworth Society's main aims are
 to conserve that which is good in the 
 village and to make improvements where
 it is deemed necessary.               
    Whenever plans are submitted       
 affecting The Conservation Area in    
 Epworth or any Listed Building, the   
 Local Planning Authority must consult 
 The Society.                          
   In September a Heritage/ Information
 Centre is due to be opened in a listed
 building in The Market Place.         
 Artefacts and photographs from bygone 
 days will be exhibited and information
 will be available on local places of  
 interest.                             
    It will be manned by volunteers    
 from the society, membership of which 
 is now approximately one hundred.
