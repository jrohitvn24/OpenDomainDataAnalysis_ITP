		<content>   Our block is situated on the north- 
 east slopes of the North Downs.It is  
 an area showing typical traditional   
 Kent farming.From the higher ground   
 there is a wonderful panaramic view of
 the salt marsh coast,the Swale Estuary
 and the Isle of Harty (part of        
 Sheppey).                             
   The land is a mix of Solid and Drift
 geology.The soil types flow from north
 to south throughout the block.From    
 east to west there is Brickearth,     
 Thanet Beds surrounding Oldhaven Beds 
 and Alluvium in the central valley.   
 Moving up towards the hills there is  
 another strip of Thanet Beds, Oldhaven
 Beds and finally London Clay.         
   The latter often slumps after heavy 
 rain or major roadworks etc..We have  
 found a relationship between soil     
 types and crops,details of which can  
 be found on page three.               </content>
