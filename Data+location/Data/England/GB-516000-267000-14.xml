		<title>14Cricket Bat Manufacture</title>
		<content> For twenty six years Mr. Bernie       
 Facer has been making cricket bats,   
 the last seven years in Buckden.      
 The bats handles are made of maneau   
 cane which comes in a long poles that 
 have to be cut to length and split    
 down the middle.A layer of rubber is  
 layed on it and then a wedge of       
 wood before the other half is layed on
 top and string wound around it. The   
 blade is made from specially grown    
 female willow.It has to be dried      
 before being pressed under three tons 
 of pressure to harden the wood. Before
 it is hardened it is easy to dent  the
 blade with a hammer but afterwards the
 wood is not even marked.              
  At the moment Mr. Facer is also      
 making minature sets of stumps from   
 the wood of a lime tree on the Kent   
 County Cricket Ground.
