		<title>02A Sunday with Sally's family</title>
		<content> I woke up at 8.00 and got             
 dressed. Then I went downstairs for a 
 breakfast of toast and peanut butter. 
 It is church day, therefore my Mum    
 took my sister and myself by car. We  
 drove past fields and hedges until we 
 got to{Paulton Catholic Church.}When  
 Church was finished, we went home. Dad
 had been busy packing a picnic, and he
 said that we would go{strawberry      
{picking.}We went picking at{Cheddar   
{Gorge.}I ate most of the strawberries 
 we picked and they were lovely. Later,
 we had a picnic in the{Mendip         
{Hills.}After that we drove home and   
 all had a game of tennis in the back  
 garden. Dad won all the games. I was  
 by this time very tired, so just      
 before going to bed I had a hot bath.
