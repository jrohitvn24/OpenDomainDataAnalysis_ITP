		<title>14EMPLOYMENT IN YATTON</title>
		<content>        In the olden days              
 most of the inhabitants of Yatton     
 would have been employed in           
 agricultre.At the time of the         
 Industrial Revolution a furniture     
 factory was established,initially     
 manufacturing church pews and school  
 desks. The successor to this company, 
 Avalon furniture,closed in 1985,      
 throwing many people out of work.     
 However, a  computer firm may take    
 over.Another local industry is the    
 Titan ladder factory. Recently,two    
 sites containing small industrial     
 units have been established in Yatton,
 and a double glazing firm has expanded
 its offices and factory .However,     
 most of the working people in Yatton  
 commute to Clevedon,Weston-super-Mare 
 or Bristol.Part time employment is    
 available in the local shops, country 
 club and garden centre.               </content>
