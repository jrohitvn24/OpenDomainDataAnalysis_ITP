 Cuttleford Farm is situated on the    
 Cheshire plain on very fertile land.It
 is a mixed farm of 135 acres,         
 consisting of 55 acres of barley, 12  
 acres of potatoes and 68 acres of     
 grass.The owner has 32 Friesian cows  
 producing 400 litres of milk per day. 
 The calves are sent to a farm in      
 Staffordshire to be fattened for beef.
 Hay making takes place three times a  
 year and is one of the busiest times  
 on the farm.Seasonal workers help with
 this job.The hay is stored as winter  
 food for the cattle.The farmer has two
 tractors,a potato harvester,two       
 trailers,a mower,a hay turner,a plough
 and a muckspreader to help him on the 
 farm.This farm is typical of many in  
 the area although alot of them cut    
 grass to make silage instead of making
 hay.                                  </content>
