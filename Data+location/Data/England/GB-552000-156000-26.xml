<title>26Ecology - Flora of the Downs</title>
<content>

Kemsing Nature Reserve, on the North Downs and Cockney's Wood is a small area of the North Downs where in the valley there are buzzards, door mice and many wild flowers. One of the most unusual is the  Orchid  of which ten varieties have been seen in the past 85 years. The chalky escarpment interspersed with woodland is ideal for their growth. Man orchid,Bee,Common Spotted orchis, Pyramid, Fragrant and the Twayblade orchis have all been sighted in 1985. Other unusual orchids which are sometimes seen are the Helleborine, Bird's Nest and Butterfly orchids. Orchids are mostly about the size of a bluebell, often with spotted leaves and those mentioned here are all pink or yellow/brown in colour.  &lt;br />&lt;br />In Cockney's Wood deposits of gault clay have produced the correct habitat for the more common orchids. They are a protected species of plant. The trees in the area are also protected.   &lt;br /> &lt;br />
