		<title>19A RIDING SCHOOL</title>
		<content> 3 Greys Riding School is situated in  
 School Lane, Pyecombe. It was started 
 in 1963 and consists of 12 stables on 
 an 8O acre site. The school owns 6    
 horses, 14 ponies and 2 donkeys with  
 2O ponies at livery. All ponies have  
 to be sensible and quiet. The ponies  
 work no more than 5 hours per day     
 although day treks last from 1O am to 
 4 pm with 1 hour break for lunch.     
 Sunday is the busiest day. All treks  
 are escorted and bridle paths on the  
 Downs are used. The owner and 3 girls 
 work at the stables. There are also 2 
 working pupils, 1 groom and 1         
 Assistant Instructor. The day begins  
 at 7 am, 15 minutes is allowed to     
 clean each stable. Riders are mostly  
 local from Brighton, Burgess Hill,    
 Hassocks and Haywards Heath. One comes
 regularly from London and one in      
 summer from France.                   </content>
