		<content> The{Phoenix (B.S.C.) Social Club}now  
 owns{62 acres of ponds}and land. There
 are three ponds in a curve, 2 of them 
 probably made before the 16 century   
 the 3rd one added much later in a     
{delightful wooded valley.}The valley  
 is used for the{fishing club}and for  
{walking.}There are the some old coach 
{roads}and{pathways}running through and
{2 streams}enter on the eastern end    
 which were dammed to form the ponds.  
 Excavations are going on to uncover   
{ancient weirs}and other stonework.    
 Firsby {reservoir}overflows into this 
 valley and there are{100yrs old brick-
{built conduits}buried deeply to take  
 the extra water. On the south side a  
 steam enters the pond. It is locally  
 known as the{Lions mouth}or{Sweet     
{Well,}but is now{polluted.}There      
 are many varieties of trees and       
 flowers on the steep valley sides.    </content>
