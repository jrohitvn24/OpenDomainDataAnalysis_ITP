<title>18Earlham house shopping centre</title>

<content>



There have been some changes at Earlham House Shopping Centre over the years. The chip shop, baker's and bank have all gone. Now we have a Chinese restaurant, two take-aways (Indian and pizza), two charity shops a cafe and a "green" grocers selling organic and local products and also with a cafe. A bed and carpet shop, a dry cleaners and Purple - an electic collection of clothes, cards and gifts. The supermarket is now a co-op and the most recent arrival is NANSA's art gallery and shop where works by its members will be shown on an equal footing with work by those outside the organisation. Among it all the post office, which is also a chemist, remains steadfast and well used.   &lt;br />
