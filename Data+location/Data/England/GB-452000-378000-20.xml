		<content>{Whitwell Wood}is a roughly rectangular
 area about 1.5km by 1km, managed by   
 The{Forestry Commision.}It consists   
 largely of mixed deciduous trees. In  
 addition there are areas of conifer,  
 mainly pine and larch. Beneath the    
 canopy of the mature trees the ground 
 in July receives little sunlight and  
 few plants can survive. Ground Elder  
 and Ivy often carpets the ground      
 alone, together with a few grasses    
 and small flowers, like the Wood      
 Sorrel which follows the spring       
 Bluebells. The wood is crisscrossed by
 unmetalled roads, to allow access for 
 forestry vehicles, and many footpaths 
 have been established to enable the   
 public to enjoy the wood and make use 
 of it as a leisure amenity following  
 waymarked paths.{Horse riding}is      
 allowed in the wood by special permit,
 all other{transport}is prohibited.    </content>
