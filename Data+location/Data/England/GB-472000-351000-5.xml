		<title>05What are our houses like ?</title>
		<content> The standard of housing throughout    
 the area is very{good}and relatively  
{highly priced,}with a mixture of{old} 
 and{new.}There are some exceptionally 
 large houses. The vast majority are   
{privately owned}but a small number of 
{council houses}are to be found at     
 Fiskerton and Rolleston.              
 There is no special accomodation for  
 the elderly or disabled.              
 Many old buildings have been renovated
 and disused barns changed into homes. 
 The planning authority and residents  
 prefer this to new housing as it helps
 to preserve the character of the      
 villages. It is also thought that too 
 rapid a growth in village size would  
 be bad and, because of this, it is now
 very difficult to obtain planning     
 permission for new properties.        
 There is little opportunity for most  
 first time buyers.                    </content>
