		<title>11Going Shopping</title>
		<content> Our survey showed us that the majority
 of families on the Rookery Farm Estate
 make a big weekly shopping expedition 
 to a nearby Hypermarket, usually      
 towards the end of the week. They buy 
 food, toiletries, cleaning materials  
 and general provisions. Over half     
 these families go shopping by car. The
 local shops are used once, twice or   
 three times a week and occasionally   
 they shop in a nearby town or city.   
 There is a local parade of shops, that
 serve the Estate, at Belland Drive.   
 Many of these shops found Monday,     
 Tuesday and Saturday to be their      
 busiest days. The shops comprise of a 
 butcher, wool/haberdashery, newsagent,
 hairdressers, Post Office/hardware,   
 fish and chip bar, supermarket, Estate
 Agent, an Electrical shop, and a Cycle
 shop.
