		<title>15The Police in Halewood.</title>
		<content>   A class visited the local police    
 station. From our visit we found out a
 number of things.                     
   In Halewood, police officers, either
 men or women, were given the same jobs
 to do. There are about 50 officers in 
 our local police station, the highest 
 rank being a sergeant in the uniform  
 and C.I.D. sections. Most of the      
 policemen patrol on foot.             
    Halewood has always had a police   
 station. The original stations were a 
 cottage on Greenbridge Lane replaced  
 by a larger house on the same lane.   
 The present station on Leathers Lane  
 was completed in 1965 and has a charge
 office, an enquiry desk and four cells
 for prisoners plus interview rooms,   
 offices and C.I.D. sections.          
    Some schools have a police officer 
 attached to the school as well as     
 there being a junior liason officer.  </content>
