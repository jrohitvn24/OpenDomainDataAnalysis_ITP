		<title>17MR. SANTI'S FISH AND CHIPS</title>
		<content> Fish and chips have been a popular    
 food in England for many years.We     
 spent time with the owner of our local
 shop,Mr.Santi,to find out what it was 
 like to run a local business.         
 Mr.Santi has been running his shop for
 over 10 years and he works very hard. 
 He employs two people to serve,and    
 does all the cooking himself.He went  
 into business after seeing how well   
 his friend had succeeded.He opens 6   
 days a week,at lunch and in the       
 evening.He has got a reasonable choice
 of food ranging from chips(30p per    
 portion),to fish(53p)and chicken(80p).
 Mr.Santi is supplied with his potatoes
 from Liverpool Fruit and Veg. Market  
 and uses mainly local potatoes.Much of
 his fish comes from Scotland and is   
 Cod.He rents his shop from the council
 but it needs repairs to a leaking     
 roof.             {(S.Cloy/J.Langton) </content>
