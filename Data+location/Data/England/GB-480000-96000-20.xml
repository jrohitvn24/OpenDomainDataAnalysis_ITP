		<title>20EAST WITTERING FIRE STATION</title>
		<content>   Our local fire station is manned by 
 part-time firemen.They are called out 
 about twice a week,and some weeks as  
 many as four times,and up to a hundred
 times a year.There are eight part-time
 firemen at East Wittering and,usually,
 six of them go out on a call.The fire 
 station was built in 1947.Previously  
 the appliance was kept in a shed near 
 the Village Hall and,before that,it   
 was kept in the open.                 
   The most busy time for the firemen  
 is in the Summer when everything is so
 dry,or at the beginning of Autumn when
 people begin to light their fires     
 without first having the chimney      
 cleaned.                              
   They are called out on all sorts    
 emergencies including fires,home      
 emergencies and road accidents.
