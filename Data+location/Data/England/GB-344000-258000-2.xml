		<title>02FARMING IN WEST LEOMINSTER</title>
		<content>   Farming is the principal activity in
 the area and consists of rough        
 pasture, arable land and orchards.    
   The arable crops consist of wheat,  
 maize, oil-seed rape, hops, sugar     
 beet, potatoes and other vegetables   
 and soft fruit.                       
   Pastureland supports dairy herds,   
 beef cattle and sheep.Some of the     
 original Hereford herds have been     
 crossed with imported Charollais      
 bulls.  Dairy herds are mostly        
 Friesian.                             
   There is a race-horse training      
 establishment and also a large        
 intensive turkey production unit.     
 Pheasants are also bred here for      
 shooting.                             
   The orchards are mainly of cider    
 apples and perry pears, which are     
 contract grown for local cider makers 
 (some of the largest in the country). </content>
