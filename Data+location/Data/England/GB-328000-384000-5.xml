		<title>05SWAN HILL DAIRY IN PRENTON</title>
		<content>   {Swan Hill Dairy}was built in 1931. 
 It is a large, brick building on a    
 busy main road. The front of the main 
 building is set back 45 metres from   
 the main roadway and the space left   
 has been made into gardens.           
    The Dairy has three{processes.}It  
 receives milk from farms, pasteurises 
 it and bottles it. The glass bottles  
 are bought and the plastic bottles and
 cartons are made at the dairy.        
    There are 60 people in the         
 workforce. The first workers begin    
 work at 3.30am and work continues for 
 some until 6.00pm. They all wear white
 hats and overalls.                    
    The milk arrives in tankers, each  
 carrying 9000 litres, from about 90   
 farms, which are all on the{Wirral.   
    The Dairy delivers to depots and   
 about 40,000 houses in Wirral.
