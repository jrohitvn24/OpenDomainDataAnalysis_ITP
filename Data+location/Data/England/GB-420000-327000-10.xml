		<content>School starts at 9.oÂ£clock with one of 
the upper form pupils ringing the bell.
First we have assembly where the whole 
school is gathered together,usually to 
listen to a story and also to have     
notics about the weekÂ£s happeningÂ£s.   
After,all the classes go back into     
their classrooms and have set lessons. 
Our class usually has mathematics,in   
which we split into four groups.       
Then we have a break of fifteen        
minutes.We play netball and football   
and there is always a teacher on duty  
in the playground.After break we have  
topic;this termÂ£s topic is about       
Edwardian times.                       
We carry on until twelve noon when we  
have dinner.We line up in the hall and 
collect a tray and knives and forks,   
then get our food and sit down.
