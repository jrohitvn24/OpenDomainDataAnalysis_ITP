		<title>01MIDDLETON IN WARWICKSHIRE</title>
		<content> Middleton in l985 is a mainly         
 agricultural area, with the land being
 owned by five large farming concerns  
 who have absorbed the assets of the   
 smaller farms, retaining the land     
 whilst selling the buildings for      
 private dwellings. Although the       
 majority of the land around Middleton 
 is listed as 'grade 2 - arable', much 
 of the area to the south-east is rich 
 in gravel bearing strata, and this is 
 now being extracted. Less than 1% of  
 the area's population work locally,   
 the majority of inhabitants finding   
 places for employment, social         
 activities and the purchase of        
 domestic goods in the nearby towns of 
 Birmingham, Sutton Coldfield, Tamworth
 and Coleshill. Although the areas has 
 a Public House, Village Hall and two  
 shops, the bulk of facilities are     
 supplied from outside the area.       </content>
