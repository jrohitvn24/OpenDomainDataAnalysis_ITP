 The story  takes place in Garras.The  
 Bishop at Garras had two sons and     
 every  night he would say good night  
 to them. Then one night they went to  
 bed  as usual when something          
 strange happened. They heard footsteps
 coming up the stairs and they thought 
 it was their father but he didn't come
 in to say goodnight.The next morning  
 they asked why he did not say good    
 night but he said that he was not at  
 home.                                 
 We heard you go up the stairs insisted
 the boys. It wasn't their dad so they 
 presumed it was a ghost.              
 Sometimes,on certain nights, footsteps
 are still heard walking up the stairs 
 and the house is said to be haunted.
