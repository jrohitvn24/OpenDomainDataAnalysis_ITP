		<title>10Kiwi School Bulford</title>
		<content>   Kiwi School is one of the two       
 Primary Schools on the Camp.It has 214
 pupils between the ages 5 and 11 and  
 eight teaching staff.The longest      
 serving teacher is the Deputy         
 Headmistress who has been in the      
 school since it opened 20 years ago.  
   The majority of the children in the 
 school,(there is only one exception)  
 are the children of serving army      
 personnel. As a result of their       
 father'S postings they stay in the    
 school for only 18 months to 2 years. 
   The school is named after the Kiwi  
 cut out of the chalk hill above       
 Bulford,and because of this New       
 Zealand connection the school has been
 visited by the All Black's rugby team 
 and the New Zealand High Commissioner.
