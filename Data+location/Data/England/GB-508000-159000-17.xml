		<title>17THE COBHAM NEWS AND MAIL</title>
		<content> These were the the main news items in 
 the paper between July 3rd and July   
 10th .                                
                                       
 A major article dealt with the growing
 drug problem in Elmbridge and there   
 was an interview with Dr. Mike Tristam
 who runs the Surrey Drugline          
 information service.                  
                                       
 The Ombudsman was brought in to       
 investigate a council decision in     
 withdrawing sheltered housing status  
 from a group of 7 bungalows and 8     
 flats in Middleton Road, Cobham. The  
 Ombudsman found the council guilty and
 so the council apologised and paid    
 compensation to a group of elderly    
 Cobham residents.                     
                                       
 Police are investigating some         
 vandalism to cars in Esher.           </content>
