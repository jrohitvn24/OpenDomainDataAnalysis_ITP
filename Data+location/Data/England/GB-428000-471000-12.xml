		<title>12CHANGING TIMES IN RIPON</title>
		<content> 1905                                  
 My grandfather had coaches and he took
 people from the Unicorn hotel to      
 the station.There were other          
 coaching inns, one of which,The York  
 Inn,stood where Boots chemists is     
 now.In this time (women)wore tight    
 corsets and small bustles and ankle   
 length dresses,men wore tight trousers
 and spats.                            
 1925                                  
 Sir Alan Cobham's"Air Circus" visited 
 Ripon on the site where the race      
 course is now and for half a crown you
 could have a flight above Ripon.School
 children of Ripon had swimming lessons
 at the bathing pavilion(by the river  
 Ure)where Mr.Duffield taught you to   
 swim with the aid of a pole and a     
 leather hoop.At the bathing pavilion  
 people swam,punted and sometimes even 
 camped.                               </content>
