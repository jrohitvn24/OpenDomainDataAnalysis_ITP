		<title>16Local facilities-Guisborough</title>
		<content> In our survey of 50 parents (see last 
 page)18 specified road planning;12,   
 parks;10,bus services, as amenities   
 they felt were bad.Commended by most  
 were health centres &amp; primary schools.
 23 said they'd seen improvement in    
 local facs. in recent years. Facs.for 
 the young &amp; narrow roads (town centre 
 congestion) were also mentioned.We    
 asked if Guisb.C should have bought   
 the large Georgian'Sunnyfield House'  
 on Westgate as a community centre last
 year;28 said yes;20: no, a waste of   
 money.On congestion,43 wanted a by-   
 pass round the town to the N; 3 felt  
 it would make for a loss of trade.The 
 heavy traffic on Sats &amp; in holiday    
 season,affecting the town centre,was  
 much mentioned.Another complaint was  
 lack of shops,etc.in outlying housing 
 estates.But,all in all,people like    
 living in Guisborough!                </content>
