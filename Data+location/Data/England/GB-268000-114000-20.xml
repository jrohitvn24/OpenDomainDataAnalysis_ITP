		<content> S Molton or Fore St!). Perhaps the    
 chief concern is the lack of facilit- 
 ies for the young. Many comments made 
 were simply cries for buildings such  
 as a Sports Centre with its associated
 facilities. A concern of the village  
 is the police...More visible (village)
 police...permanently manned police sta
 ...especially outside pubs at closing 
 time...a veterinary. Finally, comments
 not noted above: Much does go on..good
 selection of social organisations...  
 marvellous community...good quality of
 life. Amen!{TRANSPORT  }The most      
 popular way of communicating with     
 Exeter or Barnstaple is the use of    
 one's car, or Turner's bus used by car
 or non-car owners alike because of its
 economical fare. Weekly buses go on   
 four days to Exeter, once to S Molton 
 &amp; once to Barnstaple. Railways come a 
 poor third - station 3 km S of village</content>
