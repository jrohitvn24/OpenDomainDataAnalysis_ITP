		<content>{Hillesley: Past &amp; Present. }Having    
 lived in Hillesley all my life (60+   
 years) I have seen many changes, some 
 for the better and some perhaps not so
 good. Years ago the village consisted 
 mostly of small cottages having only  
 two bedrooms, living room and kitchen,
 yet the families were sometimes very  
 large. Water was not always laid on,  
 it had to be carried from stand pipes.
 Coal and wood fires were the only     
 means of heating and cooking; lighting
 by oil lamps and candles. Before the  
 1914/18 war there were a few street   
 lamps run on acetylene gas piped from 
 local premises. Electricity arrived in
 1950/51 and the main sewer as recently
 as 1978. The church and chapel were   
 always well attended with families    
 going to services every Sunday. Sadly,
 the attendance is not so great despite
 an extra 40 houses.                   </content>
