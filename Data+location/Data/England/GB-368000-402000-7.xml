		<title>07POP CULTURE IN LITTLE HULTON</title>
		<content>    Most pupils at our school enjoy {  
{pop music.   Many start collecting    
{recrds before the age of ten.}Those   
 that have favourite singers or groups 
{tend to buy pop magazines}to read     
 about their idols.   Some join fan    
 clubs and many buy posters and pin-   
 ups.  All agreed that the{image}of the
 group presented in their T.V. videos  
 was important.   Indeed many admitted 
 that the way their idols look is more 
 important than the songs.             
    Those who buy records tend to buy  
 singles rather than E.P.'s or Albums. 
 Some prefer to buy cassettes (the     
 sound is stored on magnetic tape)     
 because they are longer lasting,small 
 and durable.  However most favour     
 records (large plastic discs) because 
 there is more prestige to owning a    
 record collection and because you also
 get a very attractive artistic sleeve.</content>
