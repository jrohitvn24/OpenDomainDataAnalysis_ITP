		<title>04VICTORIA HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>  Victoria Hospital was built in 1885,a
 hundred years ago,it was named after  
 Queen Victoria. The hospital has three
 floors.                               
   It is going to be closed on the 31st
 July 1985 because of lack of money and
 redevelopment.Nearby residents will   
 miss the hospital because it is over  
 a mile to Oldchurch Hospital. In      
 recent times Victoria Hospital has had
 no beds, therefore the staff have     
 dealt mostly with out-patients. Many  
 doctors have clinics there, dealing   
 with eye problems, ear, nose and      
 throat, as well as general surgery.   
   Approximately 50 children visit the 
 hospital Tuesdays. Soon Victoria      
 Hospital will be gone and Romford will
 miss a familiar landmark.
