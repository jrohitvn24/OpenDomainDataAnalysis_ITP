		<title>05GRASSLAND IN BERKELEY VALE</title>
		<content> The{grassland}around Berkeley Power   
 Station is mainly used for{grazing    
 cattle. When the weather is warm      
 enough cattle go out into the fields; 
 they are brought in early morning and 
 late afternoon for{milking.}During the
 summer they do not need the feed      
 concentrates as the grass should give 
 them all they need. During the summer 
 though, nitrogen{fertilisers}are used 
 to help grass growth to ensure        
 enough summer and winter feed.        
{Silage}is the most popular way of     
 storing crops with local farmers. It  
 can either be in sealed, clamped      
 containers with the grass well        
 compacted to remove air or in rolls in
 sealed air tight bags. Both methods   
 are used locally.                     
{Hay}is often made, weather permitting 
 the drying, and stored in large barns.
 Some of the bales can weigh \ tonne.  </content>
