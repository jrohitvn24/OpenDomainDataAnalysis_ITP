    The Hall has two impressive        
 features, the first being the very big
 stair case and the other is a huge    
 mirror with a brass frame. The mirror 
 measures approximately 4.5 metres by  
 3 metres.                             
    During the war the boiler room of  
 the Hall was used for keeping         
 prisoners and on V.E.(Victory in      
 Europe) Day the soldiers held parties 
 of celebration there.  Near the Hall  
 is a large house called "The Breedon  
 Cafe", which is now a residential     
 house, but used to be a cafe.  In the 
 cellars of the house there are        
 paintings on the walls that were done 
 by the prisoners of war during the    
 Second World War.
