		<title>06LIFESTYLE IN OLD HACKFORD</title>
		<content> We interviewed Cissy Buck who is 80   
 years old and has lived in Hackford   
 for 75 years. She lives in a          
 house,built in 1866, that used to be a
 shop until about 3 months ago. Cissy's
 family had owned the shop for 80      
 years. In the past there was no       
 electricity and they obtained water   
 from a well in her garden. The roads  
 were narrow and made of stone and     
 earth. The first person to own a car  
 was Mr. Watling. Work was associated  
 with agriculture, such as horsemen and
 cowmen. There was also a blacksmith.  
 She attended Wicklewood School which  
 had strict teachers, and left at      
 14 years of age.                      
  There were two publichouses in the   
 village called King's Head and Red    
 Lion. A bomb dropped near the         
 church.War time evacuees left after   
 the war.                              </content>
