   Four pupils from Saltshouse JHS     
 were interested in{recreation}so they 
 visited the stables owned by Brookes. 
   The{livery}charges range from Â£16 to
 Â£26 depending on the size of the horse
 The riding charges are Â£4 per hour.   
   The {horses}are fed on oats, barley,
 sugarbeet pulp, hay and pony nuts.    
 They drink water.                     
   Fourteen{horses}and ponies are kept 
 there. Ten belong to the stables and  
 four are{livery.  }                   
   The basic schooling and jumping     
 lessons are very good. When we        
 interviewed a rider she thought the   
 rates were fine and the facilities and
 atmosphere were excellent.            
   Although a few exams. are needed for
 the job of a{groom},common sense is   
 considered more important.
