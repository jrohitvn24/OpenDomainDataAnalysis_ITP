		<content>     They only farm animals such as    
 sheep and cattle.  At one time they   
 had many horses and many grooms but   
 now they only have one groom to look  
 after 2 horses.  The estate also buys 
 pheasants which they release onto the 
 estate and shoot.  The shooting starts
 at the end of November, and for the   
 grouse, the 12th of August.           
     The laird's family, the{Drummond  
{Murrays,}have lived on the estate for 
 over 100 years.  In the woods there is
 a grave yard where all the lairds of  
 the estate are buried, even a one day 
 old child who was to be the laird.    
     The "big house" is not the        
 original, that was blown up.  There is
 an old clock tower on the estate but  
 it is now unsafe to go in to.  Many of
 the buildings on the estate are very  
 old and form an important part of our 
 heritage.                             </content>
