		<title>03MUNDON AND OSEA-CROPS GROWN</title>
		<content> Farming in this area is almost totally
 cereal crops. The main crop is wheat. 
 Quite a lot of barley is grown as well
 as peas,sweetcorn and rapeseed. Some  
 of the soil is not suited to the      
 growing of crops such as potatoes or  
 sugarbeet.                            
   Freshfields farm grows only cereals 
 but Iltney farm still has some animals
 At the moment it has 40 beef cattle   
 and 90 sheep.There are also chickens  
 to supply eggs for the family and one 
 cow to provide the milk.              
   The cereals are sold by the farmer  
 wherever they can get the best price  
 but the sheepskins are collected by   
 the Wool Marketing Board.             
   Farmers have chosen to grow cereals 
 because,until recently,this has been  
 profitable and because they are not   
 tied to the farm as they would be with
 dairy-farming.                        </content>
