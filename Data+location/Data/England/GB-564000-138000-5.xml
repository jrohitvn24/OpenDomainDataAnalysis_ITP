		<title>05Hop Drying in Brenchley</title>
		<content>   The stems of the hop plants are     
 brought to the hop picking shed and   
 fed into a machine.{The hop stripping 
{machine at Tibbs Court Farm is the    
{largest in England,}it separates the  
 flowers from the leaves and stalks.The
 hops are loaded into ovens and dry in 
 3 hours.The dried hops are baled by   
 pressing into a rectangular block.A   
 cloth is put in the press,hops are    
 shoveled in,pressed,a top cloth added,
 pressed again,the press opened,top and
 bottom cloths drawn together and the  
 sides fastened.                       
   There is{concern}that fewer hops are
 being grown in this country now as    
{imported hops are cheaper}and are also
 used in the lighter and increasingly  
 popular lagers.The continued use of   
 English hops is being urged to prevent
 this branch of farming from dying out 
 and disappearing from the landscape.  </content>
