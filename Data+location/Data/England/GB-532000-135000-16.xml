		<title>16LOCAL ISSUES IN CRAWLEY DOWN</title>
		<content> People in Crawley Down and Turners    
 Hill have a concern about the amount  
 of{traffic}in the villages; more so   
 in Turners Hill where the school      
 conducts an{annual traffic count.}The 
 main concern in Crawley Down is       
{aircraft noise,}because the aeroplanes
 that land and take off at{Gatwick}pass
 over the village (which they should   
 not do). They are concerned about     
 aircraft noise too at the{Mobile Home 
{Park}at{Fen Place.}Another thing that 
 bothers the people of Crawley Down is 
 the lack of a{policeman.}Crawley Down 
 is bigger than both Turners Hill and  
{Copthorne}and yet is the only village 
 without a policeman. People think that
 if Crawley Down had a policeman it    
 would reduce the amount of{vandalism. 
 People also feel that there might not 
 be so much vandalism if there were    
 more things for{young people}to do.   </content>
