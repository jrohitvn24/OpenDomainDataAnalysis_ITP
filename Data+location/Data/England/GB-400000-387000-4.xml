 Pennine hills which run down Northern 
 England.There is more of the National

 place in the country but it is        
 extended to Cheshire and Staffordshire
 In the Peak District there are two    
 kinds of country.The Northern part is 
 made up of flat moorlands.It is       
 covererd with heather and peat bog.Not
 many people live there.The highest    
 point is kinder(612 metres).Dry       
 limestone hills are mostly in the     
 southern part.It attracts many        
 visitors because of its beautiful     
 scenery and the rivers are good for   
 fishing.The Peak District has been    
 declared a National park to keep it a 
 holiday place and preserve it from    
 industrial towns.Rowarth is in the    
 middle of the Peak District and       
 Thonsett is on the border.            </content>
