		<content> We interviewed as many people as we   
 could in our D-block and a few        
 Easthorpe children to find out what   
 their parents do for a living.        
   We were quite surprised by the range
 of occupations which were as follows: 
 Game keeper,nursery worker,social     
 worker,camp equipment dealer,insurance
 broker,quality engineering manager,   
 teacher and British Telecom Engineer. 
 One person was self-employed and two  
 were pensioners.There was also an army
 officer,brick layer,factory           
 workers,cafe assistant,children's     
 nurse,electrician,farmer,civil servant
 and a printer.There was also a worker 
 in the bacon trade and one man was a  
 pilot flying Jumbo jets.              
   The range of the distance people    
 have to travel to work is between 2   
 and 60 miles.
