		<title>19ATTITUDES IN HAMBLEDON</title>
		<content>{  Commander Goldsmith and Mrs.Graham  
{have lived in Hambledon all their     
{lives and here are some of their      
{thoughts on the changes they have     
{seen.}                                
   There used to be more than the four 
 shops there are in the village now.   
 There was a chemist,three blacksmiths,
 two bakers,three grocers, a general   
 store,two butchers,three cobblers,    
 three sweet shops,a saddlers, a cycle 
 shop and seven pubs.Everything was so 
 personal in the shops,not like in the 
 supermarket nowadays.You were made to 
 feel important as a customer then.    
   Perhaps the best things to have     
 happened to Hambledon in our lifetimes
 were the supply of electricity in the 
 1920's and the quite recent           
 introduction of main drainage!
