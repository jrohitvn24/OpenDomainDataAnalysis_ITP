		<title>11POLICING RIPPINGALE</title>
		<content> Until 15 years ago,villages had their 
 own policemen.Today,{policing of the  
{district}is centralised.This area     
 forms one of 16 parishes policed by 2 
 officers stationed at Billingborough. 
 Superimposed on these officers is an  
{Incident Response Vehicle}stationed at
 Bourne for immediate deployment to    
 incidents.Sub-divisional control is   
 based at Grantham;Stamford is the     
 section station responsible for       
 Billingborough.Emphasis is based on   
 the{reassurance beat officers}who     
 police the area for community         
 involvement and attend local council  
 meetings etc.The area has 16 hour     
 police cover by the reassurance       
 officers who use a vehicle and also   
 patrol villages on foot.This promotes 
{community contact,}reassures the      
 public and offers attention to even   
 the smallest problem.                 </content>
