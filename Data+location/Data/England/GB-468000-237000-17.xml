Shopping is difficult without a car.   
Nearest shops in Buckingham 4 miles    
away.  If one needs a coat or dinner  
service' one goes to Milton Keynes or  
Northampton.  Papers are delivered;    
postman brings mail and the milkman    
dairy products plus potatoes, bread etc
if ordered.  All these services are in-
valuable to the elderly - being often  
the only contact they have during the  
day.  A vegetable carrier visits once  
a week and mobile shop, but at 9 pm!   
Recently a post office was reopened in 
Akeley and the owner of the Old School 
has Planning permission for a shop.    
The local pub is popular with folk     
wishing to eat and many locals do not  
bother to patronise it.  There is bad 
feeling' here.
