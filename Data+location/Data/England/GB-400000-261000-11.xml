		<title>11FECKENHAM CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church of St John the Baptist is  
 situated on the village square in the 
 village of Feckenham. Gypsy Rose Lee  
 is supposed to be buried in the church
 yard. During the war, the railings    
 round her grave were left alone, when 
 all other metal in the grave yard was 
 used for the war effort - the locals  
 feared her curse.                     
   The church itself has a square      
 Norman tower. There are eight bells in
 the belfry, two are supposed to be    
 original.There used to be a pub in the
 village called The Eight Bells across 
 the road from the church but this is  
 now a private house.The old bells are 
 still rung every Tuesday evening.     
 There is a list of vicars of Feckenham
 inside the church going back to       
 1235.The present vicar  is a deputy   
 headmaster of a school in Birmingham  
 as well as vicar of the Parish .      </content>
