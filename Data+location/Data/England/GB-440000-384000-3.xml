		<content> We studied the ecology in our area and
 we found that the wildlife was mainly 
 birds and dogs.The birds were mostly  
 sparrows and blackbirds.The plantlife 
 was mainly trees and flowers in       
 peoples gardens.There was plenty of   
 grass at the side of the pathway.The  
 dogs and cats that we saw were mainly 
 peoples pets.The trees that we saw    
 were mainly oak and chestnut trees.   
 If you were lucky you would see       
 something like a hedgehog.The insects 
 consisted of flies, spiders and worms.
 The other birds we saw were crows and 
 magpies.The wildlife didn't have much 
 chance because most of the land was   
 covered with houses and gardens.There 
 were very few fields and the main crop
 was wheat.                            
 Trees have just started to blossom    
 and gardens have just flowered.
