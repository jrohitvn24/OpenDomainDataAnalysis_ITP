		<title>03Buildings in Clifton</title>
		<content>   The oldest houses in Clifton date   
 back to the 16th century,but the      
 greatest development has taken place  
 within the last 150 years. The        
 cottages in Avon Street and Spoil Bank
 Hill, were built to accommodate the   
 railway workers originally.           
   There were two public houses The    
 Bull and the Red Lion. The latter has 
 now been replaced by the Townsend     
 Memorial Hall, but The Bull is still  
 in existance. It was probably built   
 during the 18th century and was used  
 not only as an inn, but also as a     
 court of law.                         
   The church is over 900 years old and
 has been added to during that time. We
 hear that in the 16th century, the    
 people of "Clifton super Dunesmore    
 sold ye church byble to buy a         
 bayre."This was legend not fact.
