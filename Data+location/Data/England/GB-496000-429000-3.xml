		<title>03WORK AT WAULDBY.</title>
		<content> On the farmland there are two         
 cottages belonging to the             
 farmer and two of his                 
 employees live in them. There         
 used to be  eight cottages but        
 as machinery became more popular the  
 need for farm employees became less.  
 The present employees start work at   
 about 7.30am.                         
   The Wolds Way goes through the farm.
 There are certain public rights       
 of way; one for horse riders and one  
 for people walking. There is a road   
 leading from the farm going down to   
 the farmer's brother's modern farm,   
 called Little Wauldby Farm. On the    
 farm's land they have a petrol pump   
 which still works, a bacon house,an   
 old coach house and a barley store.   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
