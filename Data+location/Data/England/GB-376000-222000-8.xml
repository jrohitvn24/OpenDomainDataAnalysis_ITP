		<content> Hartpury C.E. Primary School is       
 attended by 64 children and has 3     
 teachers. The main building was built 
 in 1869 and the terrapin in 1963.     
 Situated in the countryside, we are   
 able to study nature around us and the
 local history.We play football,       
 netball and rounders against schools. 
 We learn to swim at Gloucester        
 Swimming Baths each week.As well as   
 general music lessons, we are able to 
 learn the recorder and clarinet,      
 performing concerts in the Village    
 Hall and local Churches. The Friends  
 of Hartpury School Association        
 organises social events, which raises 
 funds to buy equipment for school as  
 well as contributing to the life of   
 the community.
