		<content> LAW AND ORDER.                        
 The village does not have its own     
 Police Station or any police          
 personnel.  The whole area is policed 
 from Shrawbury which has one police   
 officer on day duty only.  Emergency  
 calls after five p.m. or whenever     
 local policemen are not on duty are   
 dealt with from Shrewsbury.  From the 
 time an emergency call is logged in   
 Shrewsbury a policeman could be in    
 Stanton within    fifteen minutes.    
 Crime is almost none existant in the  
 village and the country habit of      
 leaving doors and windows unlocked    
 when houses are unattended is still   
 very much in evidence.  On speaking to
 the oldest inhabitant we learned that 
 no major crime had occured within the 
 last fifty years.
