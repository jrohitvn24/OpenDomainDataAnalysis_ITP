		<content>{CUSTOMS-COGGESHALL}A Coggeshall job is
 a term to describe a silly piece of   
 work that somebody did.It is said that
 one day the Coggeshall clock struck 11
 o 'clock instead of 12 o'clock.When it
 was heard that Lexdon,Colchester clock
 had struck 13 o'clock Coggeshall men  
 went to collect the missing strike!   
 There were two windmills next to each 
 other,one was taken down because they 
 thought there wasn't enough wind for  
 two.Coggeshall carnival is held in the
 summer.A Queen,two Princesses and a   
 flower girl are chosen to be on the   
 carnival float.Other floats are       
 designed by Guides,Scouts,Dancing     
 Groups and the  Playgroup.The floats  
 are based on a theme like Nursery     
 Rhymes.In 1985 the theme is'Song      
 Titles'. On Shrove Tuesday the        
 women have a pancake race in Market   
 Hill.                                 </content>
