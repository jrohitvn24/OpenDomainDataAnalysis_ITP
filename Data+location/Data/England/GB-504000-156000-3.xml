		<content> William of Ockham is mentioned in the 
 special feature on the church. The    
 first Baron King, Lord Chancellor,    
 bought the Ockham Estate in 1711. His 
 descendants, the Lovelaces, were      
 Surrey landowners with special        
 influence as builders and employers   
 living nearby and in Ockham Park until
 1941 when Mary, Countess of Lovelace  
 died. John Donne spent several years  
 in Pyrford Place after his runaway    
 marriage to a cousin of the owner,    
 Francis Wolley. Queen Elizabeth I was 
 previously a visitor there. The       
 Victorian author A.J.Mumby lived in   
 Wheelers farmhouse, Pyrford for a time
 and wrote about the Ripley landscape. 
 Nelson is associated with Ripley's    
 Talbot Hotel.
