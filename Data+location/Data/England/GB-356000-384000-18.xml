 in the area but most have to travel   
 from village to their jobs.{Duponts}  
 warehouse employs 50 people, 18 manual
 and rest managerial and clerical.The{ 
{American Can}warehouse employs 6      
 workers plus 4 drivers.The complex    
 also contains their 'Technical Centre'
 which employs 20 people including     
 chief chemist, quality engineer and   
 customer technical services officer.A 
 decline in employment in{agriculture} 
 was obvious to the interviewers.Most  
 farms were run solely by owners family
 with casual labour recruited when     
 necessary.Much greater use of         
 machinery cause of this.Mrs Mounfield,
 Manor Farm said"At one time 8 Irish   
 labourers would come over for potato  
 picking and live in the shant"Now 3   
 people on potato harvester do all the 
 work.50 employed by 2 Rd.haulage firms</content>
