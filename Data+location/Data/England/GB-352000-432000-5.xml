		<content> In World War II there was no          
 television. Our speaker went to school
 by bus. She used coupons for sweets.  
 She had to take a gas mask to school  
 in a cardboard box in case there was  
 an air-raid. She went blackberry      
 picking in the summer. She had        
 a fountain pen and a scratcher pen,   
 biros were not out. When she was young
 there were no playschools. Clothes    
 were different to the ones today.     
 Policemen were on bikes. People did   
 not have contact lenses. She wore a   
 hat for school. They had cinemas on   
 Saturday mornings, there were special 
 films for children. There were no     
 motorways. The hospitals were         
 different than they are today. People 
 had watches but not like they are     
 today. The teachers were very strict. 
 When she spelt draw wrong she got the 
 cane.                                 </content>
