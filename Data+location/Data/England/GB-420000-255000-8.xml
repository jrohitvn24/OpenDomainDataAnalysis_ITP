		<content> Health. Tiddington Fields is a purpose
 built old people's home.There are 32  
 single rooms and 15 double.They do    
 have facilities for married couples   
 but these are very few because women  
 live longer than men.Of the 60 people 
 in the Home only 12 are men.Payment is
 according to what one can afford.     
 Social Services and the County Council
 pay the rest.The guests are encouraged
 to bring their own belongings and     
 furniture.There is a dining room but  
 most people have breakfast in bed and 
 supper in their own room.There are 4  
 lounges and a visitors'lounge.Guests  
 may visit their friends at any time.  
 Special facilities include a lift,hand
 rails and Parker baths.All the laundry
 is done on the premises and there is  
 a clinic and hair dressing salon to   
 cater for those who cannot go out.A   
 minibus will enable outings.          </content>
