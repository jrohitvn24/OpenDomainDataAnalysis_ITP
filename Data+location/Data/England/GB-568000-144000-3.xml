		<title>03ATTITUDES AND FEARS</title>
		<content> The majority of villagers in Collier  
Street would not like more estates     
being built because they prefer the    
character of the old houses.They fear  
greatly that any more people would     
destroy the character of the village.  
Most houses are on cess- pool drainage 
and villagers fear that if houses got  
main drainage lots more people would be
attracted and more estates would be    
built.Villagers believe that the shop  
is vitally important to the community. 
Elderly and lonely people go there and 
can be certain of meeting at least one 
person to talk to.One person,on behalf 
of every villager,said that "They did  
not like grass track racing at all...  
they think it is too noisy."The same   
lady said that she doesn't like        
extensions because they do not always  
seem to be in keeping with older parts 
of the buildings.                      </content>
