		<title>07THE BROOK IN CRUDWELL</title>
		<content> There are{two sources to the brook    
{which runs through Crudwell village.  
 One is close to the Fossway near      
 Fosse Gate and the other is near      
 Chedglow Barn.The two brooks meet on  
 the east side of Crudwell and flow on 
 until{they join Braydon Brook.}One    
 part of the brook{flows through the   
{centre of the village}past the Post   
 Office and the school field.Outside   
 the Post Office is{a ford across the  
{brook.}It is too narrow for cars to   
 use. Sightings of water birds are rare
 but children have seen{a duck with    
{a family of ducklings}earlier this    
 year. The water in the brook looks    
 very clear and{a wide variety of      
{creatures}live in it.Some parts have  
 so much weed growing in them that they
 look like minature jungles.
