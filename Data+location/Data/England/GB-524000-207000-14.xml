		<content>{HITCHINS}is situated at the top of the
 hill in old buildings that have been  
 converted into modern offices where   
 there is a computer.It started as a   
 small family building firm 25 years   
 ago but has now expanded and five     
 architects design large developments  
 at home and abroad.Building work is   
 contracted out but one section of the 
 firm screeds floors that are in       
 awkward places by using hose.         
{COUNTY CURTAINS}                      
 Up until 20 years ago Belverdere Farm 
 was run as a small mixed farm.Now it  
 is a small soft furnishing business   
 making curtains for companies in the  
 city.Twelve people are employed but   
 most of these collect work and take it
 home to finish.The curtains are cut   
 out on a long table and when they are 
 finished they are hung up until they  
 are delivered.                        </content>
