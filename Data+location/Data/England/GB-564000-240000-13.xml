		<title>13New House Farm.</title>
		<content> The oldest part of the house is 300   
 years old. It used to be called{Lings 
{Farm}but the name was changed 145     
 years ago. Some where about this time 
 an extension was added, and new       
 windows were put in. These windows    
 came from{Colchester Barracks.}There's
 a kind of courtyard surrounded by     
 three derelict barns, 1 a cow shed,   
 for the cows to go in, in winter,and 1
 for them to go in, in summer.There    
 used to be a second courtyard but     
 there's only a derelict pig barn left 
 of that.The house is no longer a real 
 farm house as the land around it is   
 farmed by someone else, and Mr.       
 Catchesides, who lives there now with 
 his family, is not a farmer.In the    
 fields around Barley, hay and Oil Seed
 Rape are grown.
