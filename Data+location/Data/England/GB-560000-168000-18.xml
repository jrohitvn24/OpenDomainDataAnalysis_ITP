 The area is commuter built up area.   
 The main amenity is communication,    
 which helps the rapid movement of     
 population into Lonodn.  In the centre
 of Longfield is the railway station   
 opened in 192O.  From that point on   
 housing and amenities grew.  The main 
 built up areas consist of three       
 nucleated villages _ e.g. Longfield,  
 Isted Rise have basic amenities e.g.  
 doctor, supermarket and chemists.  As 
 the area has large populated areas    
 nearby families use these facilities  
 as communications are good.  Rural bus
 services are declining transport      
 causing problems.  The most important 
 amenities are a supermarket and       
 garages providing petrol and servicing
 facilities.
