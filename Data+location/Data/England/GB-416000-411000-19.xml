 Woodvale Motor Group.The man we       
 interviewed owns both garages.They try
 and sell high performance cars (sports
 cars).They sell on average 4 cars a   
 month.The most expensive car costs    
 26,000 pounds and the model is the    
 Lotus Turbo Esprit.Inside it is full  
 of leather and looks like a bed       
 inside.There are 2 buildings, one is a
 showroom and the other is a workshop. 
 They mostly sell Lotus and Ferrari    
 with a few other cars like Porsches.  
 The buildings are mostly made of glass
 The showrooms are carpeted.There are  
 about 7 cars in the showroom and 4 in 
 the workshop being mended.
