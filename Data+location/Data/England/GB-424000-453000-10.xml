		<title>10DAIRY FARMING (MILKING)</title>
		<content> Many of the farms in this area are    
 dairy farms which keep cows for       
 milk.The cows get milked twice a day  
 from six o 'clock to half past eight  
 then from four o 'clock to six o'     
 clock.It takes about ten minutes for  
 each cow to be milked.The farmer      
 usually has about one hundred and     
 twenty milking cows but in summer some
 of the cows calf.The milking parlour  
 will have room for five to ten cows at
 each side.The four clusters pump the  
 milk from the udder through some      
 pipes into the tank where it is       
 stirred up to be kept cool. There are 
 different breeds of cow but the best  
 for milking are friesians and         
 holsteins.Jerseys give less milk but  
 it is creamier.The milk gets          
 transfered by milk tanker to the      
 dairy where it is cleaned and bottled.
