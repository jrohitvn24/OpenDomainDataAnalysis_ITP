		<content> Our area is an industrial area in     
 the County of{Cleveland.}The section  
 covered in the survey is mainly       
 residential.The area has four definite
 boundaries. To the South it is skirted
 by the Cleveland Hills,to the North by
 the{British Steel Corporation's Clay  
{Lane}and{Lackenby}works along the     
 banks of the{River Tees,}to the East  
 by  the giant chemical complex of the 
{Imperial Chemical Industries}and      
 finally to the West by the outskirts  
 of{Middlesbrough.}The coastal resorts 
 of{Redcar}and{Saltburn}are but a few  
 miles away as is the{North York Moors}
 National Park. Communications are good
 with its own port,ever improving road 
 links and an airport just 13 miles    
 away.
