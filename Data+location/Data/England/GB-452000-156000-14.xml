		<content>  The{Health Centre}is in the centre of
 Kingsclere. It has lots of activities 
 and several people work there. There  
 are a dentist, two doctors, nurses and
 receptionists. At the back there is a 
 meeting room where the{Red Cross}meet.
 Sometimes we can borrow equipment from
 them. There is a very nice waiting-   
 room with a fish tank, and books and  
 magazines for people to read. There is
 also a playroom for young children.   
  The Health Centre was built in 1980  
 on land which used to hold part of    
 Kingsclere School.People go there to  
 visit their doctor or dentist, to     
 receive treatment from a nurse, and   
 the district nurses and health        
 visitors keep in touch with their     
 patients at the centre. 4,600 people  
 are registered there, some from other 
 villages.There are clinics for speech 
 therapy, ante-natal care and chiropody</content>
