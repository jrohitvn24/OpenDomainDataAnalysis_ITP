		<content>Crowscarers are machines that make loud
noises to scare off birds if they are  
eating crops which they should not.The 
problem is that they can wake up people
at night if they are not switched off. 
There is a law that you are not allowed
to have a crowscarer on after 7.00pm or
on a Sunday,but some people still put  
them on.                               
Footpaths:There are about 5 footpaths  
in our area but a lot of the farmers   
block them off by shutting gates or by 
growing crops in the way.Every year a  
lot of people walk on the footpaths and
if something is in the way they trample
it down.                               
Parking:The parking problem in Little  
Addington is by the publichouse "The   
Bell.Since the new owners arrived there
have been more cars,but the car park is
too small.So they park on the grass    
verge.They are spoiling the village.   </content>
