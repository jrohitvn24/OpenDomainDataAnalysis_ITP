		<title>14THE BURTON PIDSEA CARNIVAL</title>
		<content>      The Carnival began as an Annual  
 Garden Party at Chatt House. As the   
 village got bigger they couldn't fit  
 everyone in so in 1982 they thought of
 changing to a Carnival.               
      Preparations for the Carnival    
 begin in November of the previous     
 year.They do not always have the same 
 events and attractions. And things    
 sometimes go wrong - like the year    
 when the hounds got into the cake tent
 and ate all the cakes. Sometimes      
 attractions don't turn up at all. Last
 year there was meant to be a Donkey   
 Derby but the donkeys didn't arrive.  
      Between 2000 and 2500 people are 
 expected to attend the Carnival, which
 raises around Â£7000 for the Memorial  
 Hall Funds.                           
      The parade of floats sets off at 
 1 p.m. The Carnival opens at 1.30 p.m.
 and finishes when you have had enough.</content>
