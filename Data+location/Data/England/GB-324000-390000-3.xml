		<title>03    FENDER VALLEY FARM</title>
		<content> Fender valley is a farm that is over  
 400 years old.It occupies 150 acres.  
                                       
 They keep 45 horses and 48 cattle.They
 feed the horses and cattle on         
 oats,barley,wheat,hay,maize and       
 straw.Sometimes they will add vitamins
 to their diet.Since the start of this 
 year only one foal has been born      
 because the mares wouldn't reproduce. 
                                       
  Nine people live and work at the farm
 and they produce some crops.There is  
 an 80 foot deep well.The water is     
 still drinkable and is pumped out     
 during water shortages.               
                                       
  The farmland is very low lying and   
 marshy and really not suited to       
 growing crops, being too wet. The farm
 makes money by giving riding lessons  
 for Â£1.50 an hour.                    </content>
