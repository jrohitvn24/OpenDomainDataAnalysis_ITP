		<title>03LISTED FARMHOUSES</title>
		<content> Near Wellington Heath are several     
 listed buildings.                     
{Burtons Farm}is a tall large black and
 white house built 400 years ago. The  
 external walls between many tall      
 vertical beams are now brick but some 
 of the internal walls are still daub  
 and wattle as was noticed recently    
 when a new bathroom was built.        
 Outside, there is a{barn constructed  
{by the Cruck method,}the arched beams 
 thought to have been used in a ship.  
 In the yard is a now ornamental{cider 
{press}and also a{milestone}"Gloucester
 18 miles", rescued from the nearby    
 disused Hereford-Gloucester canal.    
 The mixed farm is run by the owner's  
 absent son and contractors are brought
 in to do the ploughing and harvesting.
 The son-in-law is the UK director of  
{HACK-A-SACK,}a special non-bouncing   
 ball used in schools for training.    </content>
