		<title>17THE PLAYING FIELD H.B.</title>
		<content> Lots of things go on at our village   
 playing field throughout the year.    
 Here are some of them. We have a      
 tennis court,a B.M.X. track a rounders
 pitch, a cricket pitch, a football    
 pitch, and there are a few swings as  
 well. We have a B.M.X. club which has 
 races every Monday at half past six.  
 We have got a tennis club and there is
 coaching at the courts every Saturday 
 morning except in the winter. We are  
 hoping to get another hard court in   
 June or July.The tennis court that we 
 have now is hard not grass. In the    
 summer we have a tennis club barbecue.
 When the school plays a cricket match 
 against other schools we play on the  
 cricket pitch at the playing field.   
 On November the fifth we have a       
 bonfire there. There is a pavilion    
 there which we are renovating.
