		<content>  The school has 14 children on roll.{ 
{Staff}include head_teacher,a part_time
 assistant teacher,cook,caretaker and  
 secretary.Education caters for the age
 range 4_11 of mixed ability.The school
 has close links with nearby Lowdham   
 Primary and Calverton Comprehensive   
 school where they often attend or     
 participate in concerts.Parents help  
 to broaden the childrens experience by
 providing transport for outside{visits
 This month the children travel to     
 London and York.Such a small school   
 has limited opportunities for         
 organized{games.}The children use the 
 playground and playing field for their
 own imaginative play.Huge logs on the 
 field are a popular play area,one of  
 them is fondly known as"the elephant".
 The school closes at the end of July,a
 sad loss to the village.
