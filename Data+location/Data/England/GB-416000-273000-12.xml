		<content>  The{housing}in Dorridge is in the    
 luxury class with the average cost of 
 each property being about Â£50,000.At  
 the top end of the market{property}can
 cost as much as Â£100,000.             
  Most properties are four bed-roomed  
 detached family houses with large     
 gardens owned by the professional     
 people who make up most of the        
 population.Nearly every house is      
 equipped with a two car garage to     
 cater for the large car owning        
 population.                           
  A great deal of the housing has been 
 built in the last fifteen years on    
 what was jealously guarded 'green     
 belt' land and so was planned with a  
 low density per acre.                 
  The streets are spacious and well    
 designed and at night extremely well  
 lit.
