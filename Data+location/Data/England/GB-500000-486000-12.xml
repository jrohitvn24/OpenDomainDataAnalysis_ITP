		<content> We have a week 1 and a week 2 schedule
 Not every lesson is changed.We all get
 3 lessons of Maths and English a week.
 Some people may have P.E.once a week, 
 because they do not have a second     
 language. Other subjects include:     
 French,Environment Science,Physical   
 Science,Craft and German or Spanish.  
 Each lesson lasts 1hour 10minutes     
 which is equal to two periods. The    
 sports activites that we do at the    
 Graham School in summer are tennis,   
 netball,hockey,long jump and track    
 events.We also do cricket,
