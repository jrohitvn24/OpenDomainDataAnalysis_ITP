Ringstead is a small, quiet village of 
about 1,500 people and only 500 houses.
The housing is a great mixture         
including old cottages and barns which 
have been converted,farm houses,council
property,old type houses and several   
small private estates of new houses.   
There are few big houses,except for the
Manor House and Ringstead House.       
In the village are four shops,including
a post office,which provide for the    
every day needs of the villagers,and a 
fish and chip shop.A horse riding      
school has recently opened that is very
popular with children in this village  
and others come from villages in the   
area.                                  
Most people travel to nearby towns for 
their work as there are  few jobs in   
Ringstead.The doll factory employs some
women and the corn stores some men.    </content>
