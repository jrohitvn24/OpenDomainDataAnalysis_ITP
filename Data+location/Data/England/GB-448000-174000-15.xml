		<title>15Noise Pollution:World's End</title>
		<content> A motorway, the M4, runs through our  
 area. A new dual carraigeway, the A34 
 or the Beedon bypass, has been built, 
 this runs along the old main road.    
    These two roads cause an awful lot 
 of noise in the area as well as       
 pollution. With the continuing upsurge
 of huge tractor machinery the noise   
 level around certain farms has greatly
 increased in the last decade. Nearly  
 every weekend of the shooting season a
 party goes out to shoot in the local  
 woods. This can be considered a       
 pleasant noise compared to that of the
 motorway and roads. Local teenagers   
 use the woods for motorbike           
 scrambling. This also causes an awful 
 lot of noise and can be menacing on a 
 quiet Sunday afternoon.
