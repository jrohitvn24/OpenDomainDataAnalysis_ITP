		<title>05Fox's Biscuits</title>
		<content>  Fox's biscuits began in 1853 in a    
 small shop in Batley,by a man called  
 Mr. Alfred Henry Fox.In 1853 the main 
 biscuits were ginger biscuits and     
 brandy snaps.                         
  Such good progress was made with this
 type of trade that in 1927 they moved 
 to the present site just some few     
 hundred yards away from the origional 
 bakery.From that date it has been     
 extended to over 37,000 sqft.         
  When Mr.Fox made biscuits he made    
 them by hand,but in today's technology
 they have huge machines to make       
 them.Here are some examples of what   
 Fox's biscuits make:-custard creams   
 ,jammy dodgers,finger creams and      
 butter crinkles.                      
  The machines make the biscuits but   
 the people pack them,and fox's employ 
 over 2,000 people.Fox's biscuits is   
 the bibbest employer in Batley.       </content>
