		<title>11TRAFFIC THROUGH BEAULIEU</title>
		<content>    We went to Beaulieu and did a      
 traffic census. We were trying to find
 out what was the most popular car     
 colour.                               
    We found out that red was the most 
 popular because  we saw 45 . Blue was 
 the second with 41 and white was 3rd  
 with 39. Altogether we saw {211 }cars 
 in approximately half an hour.        
    We saw a lot more cars from Dibden 
 Purlieu than we did to Dibden Purlieu.
 Then we did a traffic census of how   
 many people per car there were. We    
 found 82 cars with 1 person in, 62    
 cars with 2 people and 6 with 3 people
 in. That was in half an hour.We saw a 
 white Porsche and a black Rolls Royce.
 We saw {263}people in {211 }cars.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
