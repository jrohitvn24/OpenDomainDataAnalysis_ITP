		<title>16THE RIDGEWAY - HUNNINGHAM.</title>
		<content>{  The Ridgeway}is an ancient track    
 or{green lane}running between{Ufton   
 and{Hunningham.}It is well defined    
 throughout its length. It crosses     
 the{Grand Union Canal}and a number    
 of roads including the{Welsh Road     
 before coming out onto the{Fosse Way. 
 Apart from the portion near{Ufton,    
 which is hilly, its gradient is gently
 undulating and its outlook pleasant   
 throughout.                           
{ The northern portion of the Ridgeway,
 from the once gated road to Long      
 Itchington on to Hunningham is well   
 marked through open fields both arable
 and pasture in use.{Horses}and some   
{sheep}graze in the pastures.          
{ The Manpower Services Commission,}in 
 1985, began restoration work  on the  
 path, filling in holes and replacing  
 the many dead elm trees with a species
 resistant to Dutch Elm Disease.       </content>
