		<content> This private family house was built in
 1703 by Sir John Harpur the 4th       
 Baronet on the site of a 12th century 
 Augustinian priory. The house and its 
 grounds, Calke Abbey, passed to the   
 National Trust in 1984 after the      
 death of Mr Charles Harpur-Crewe. It  
 covers over 1000 square metres in the 
 Baroque style, 3 storeys and about 80 
 rooms. It is currently being renovated
 for public opening in 1989. Many of   
 the rooms have been untouched for     
 years &amp; the Drawing Room has its      
 original furnishing and decoration    
 from 1856. There are large collections
 of some rare butterflies, stuffed     
 birds and animals, legacy of the      
 naturalist Sir Vauncey Harpur- Crewe. 
 There is a stable complex which is    
 being converted into shops &amp; tearooms 
 leaving some for equestrian use.
