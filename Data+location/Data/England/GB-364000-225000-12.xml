		<title>12CUSTOMS.THE ANNUAL FETE.</title>
		<content>    Any one driving along the B4221    
 going past Gorsley Goffs School on    
 the last Saturday in June would have  
 seen a hub of activity,a giant        
 football,a huge "television" and      
 scores of people rushing around.You   
 want to know the reason why ? It was  
 the annual school fete.This event has 
 been the highlight of Gorsley village 
 for over 15 years taking over from the
 Flower Show.                          
    For many weeks people had been     
 preparing for this most prestidious   
 day of the year in Gorsley's calender.
 The attractions included an inflatable
 castle,crockery smashing,handi_crafts,
 tombola,traction engine rides and many
 others.                               
    The highlight of the day must have 
 been the "Knockout"between Asfield,   
 Llangrove,Goodrich and Gorsley.Â£1080  
 was raised for the P.T.A. funds.      </content>
