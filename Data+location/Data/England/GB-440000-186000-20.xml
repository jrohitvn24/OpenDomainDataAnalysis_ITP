		<content> While doing this project we found that
Lockinge Museum was included in the    
list of Oxfordshire Museums open to the
public by arrangement.When we visited  
School House Mr.and Mrs.Wardingly      
showed us the collection they had built
up over many years.They display it in  
the hall of their house.It includes    
items of social history from Lockinge  
Estate,many passed on by villagers when
they realised that the family was      
interested in these artifacts.Also on  
display is an impressive array of      
fossils and minerals.                  
 Next door in the Old School, Miss Jill
Smith designs and makes jewellery.She  
produces an imaginative range in silver
and titanium and will undertake private
commisions.
