		<title>19THREE CRAFTSMEN</title>
		<content> The survey area has three noted       
 craftsmen living within it:-{a }      
{sculptor, an illustrator and a glass  
{blower.}The sculptor originally came  
 from East Anglia but he has been      
 living here for 18 years. He has      
 taught all over the country. He has   
 made lots of models. He makes them    
 from different materials like{plaster,
{wood and junk.}It takes 8 people to   
 lift one of his models. He uses       
 ordinary tools to make them. The model
 that he is making now will take him   
 until 1988 and will be 60 by 30 feet. 
 It will be in Bristol at an exhibition
 in 3 years time.                      
 The illustrator and his family live   
 almost as recluses in a{remote valley 
 below Polcrebo Downs. Their house was 
 built in the{17th century.}They had   
 intentions of restoring it so it would
 look the same as it did then.         </content>
