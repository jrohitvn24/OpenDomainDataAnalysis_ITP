		<title>01PART OF ASHDOWN FOREST</title>
		<content> This South East corner of Ashdown     
 Forest is in an Area of Special       
 Scientific Interest within the Sussex 
 Weald Area of Outstanding Natural     
 Beauty. Our patch of the Forest is    
 roughly saucer-shaped, rising to a    
 height of 220 metres to the East and  
 l75 metres to the West and dropping   
 down to lOO metres towards the centre.
 Heathland with occasional pine clumps 
 occupy the South and East, while the  
 centre and North West are privately   
 owned estates of farms and woods.     
 Apart from these estates almost the   
 whole of our area is common land to   
 which the public have right of        
 access.One B road runs down the       
 Eastern quarter, but the area is also 
 easily accessible to the South and    
 West, where it lies just off the main 
 Eastbourne to London road.
