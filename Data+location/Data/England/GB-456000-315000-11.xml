		<title>11PAUDY EGG FARM.</title>
		<content> This farm is owned by Mr. and Mrs.    
 Wright who have been there for 10     
 years. They own 6 acres, a house and  
 buildings which date from the         
 seventeenth century. They have 9,000  
 hens and they collect 6,500 eggs per  
 day which they sell to shops and      
 supermarkets or deliver to houses.    
 They have 3 part-time exployees. The  
 hens are kept in cages, 3 to a cage.  
 This type of farming is called battery
 farming and produces many eggs        
 economically.
