		<content>Saturday was the day of the wedding.   
I woke up very happy.I looked at my    
watch,it was 8.15.a.m.I jumped out of  
bed and ran down stairs.My mum and     
sister and dog were having breakfast.  
After breakfast I had a bath and washed
my hair .We got into the car.It was a  
fair drive to our dad's house.We       
picked him up and then went to the     
wedding. After the wedding we all had  
our picture taken then went to the     
school fete.Me,my dad,and my sister    
came home at 4.30.After we had a wash

and some more drink.It was 12.00.when
