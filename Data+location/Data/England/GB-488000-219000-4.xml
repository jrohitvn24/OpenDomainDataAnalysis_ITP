		<content> Next comes a small bungalow, converted
 from stables, and a late Victorian    
 dwelling, formerly the Vicarage. On a 
 ridge opposite stands the small grey  
 stone church dating from about 1200   
 A.D., the living shared with          
 Cheddington. Overlooking the          
 churchyard is Church Cottage which    
 predates the Rothschilds and ajoins   
 the stable block, now converted to a  
 Craft Centre. Next is the house built 
 for Baron Meyer de Rothschild to live 
 in while the mansion was being        
 constructed, now converted to three   
 dwellings. Reaching the village green 
 on the left, we find the main entrance
 to Mentmore Towers on the right, with 
 a block of three houses, formerly the 
 laundry for the mansion. Inside the   
 ornate wrought-iron gates is Stone    
 Lodge.
