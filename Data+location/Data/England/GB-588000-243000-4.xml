		<content>  An airfield used by U.S.A.F.Flying   
Fortresses was built in World War Two. 
It had three runways and about 3000 men
lived in temporary accommodation       
in, and around the village.There       
is only one of the original hangars    
left and this has been resheeted and   
is used for storing E.E.C. grain.The   
control tower was taken down about ten 
years ago and just the base can be     
seen.The main runways were broken up   
nearly twenty years ago and the land   
returned to farming,mostly grain.Most  
of the perimeter road remains and gate 
posts can still be seen on the Sudbury 
road.These mark the positions where    
gates closed off the road when the     
runways were in use.
