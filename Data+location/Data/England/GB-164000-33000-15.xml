		<content> By{1965}there were no shops left.     
 The water still came from a spring.   
 The school was about the same size    
 as it is today. Electricity had       
 been installed. People began to do    
 every kind of work because there      
 were cars to take them further        
 afield. In 1965, the milkman came     
 round in his milk van delivering      
 milk. There were two new bungalows    
 built in Crowan. There was no         
 blacksmith but the forge was later    
 used as a pottery.The mills were      
 still used and the looms in them were 
 working too. A few years later, the   
 mill closed down. In 1957 a farm      
 for battery reared chickens was       
 opened. The same farm also grows      
 bulbs in many of the neighbouring     
 fields and markets early{spring}
