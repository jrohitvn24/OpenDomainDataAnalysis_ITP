		<title>14HENWICK STATION. PART ONE.</title>
		<content> Although closed as a passenger station
 following the Beeching Report,with    
 buildings &amp; platforms demolished,     
 passenger trains (no freight) still   
 use the line to Hereford,Worcester    
 Foregate Street/Birmingham or         
 Worcester Shrub Hill/Oxford &amp; London. 
 There are 4 locomotive hauled trains &amp;
 40 ageing diesel multiple units per   
 day.The manual Great Western Railway  
 signal box is used for controlling    
 semaphore signals &amp; points;there is   
 two way working on the track from     
 Henwick to Worcester Foregate Street, 
 with crossover &amp; holding siding still 
 at Henwick.The level crossing with    
 electricaly operated lifting barriers,
 contributes to traffic congestion by  
 restraing traffic flow;some motorists 
 even occasionally stop on the track   
 between the raised barriers!!
