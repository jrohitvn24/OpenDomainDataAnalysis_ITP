		<title>14CANFIELD NURSERY</title>
		<content> There are several nurseries in the    
 area, one being Canfield Nursery owned
 and managed by Mr and Mrs Collins and 
 sixteen staff.  The ten acre site     
 contains two acres of greenhouses, a  
 stabling block and paddock, sheds,    
 general buildings, a small nature     
 reserve, main house and garden.       
 Greenhouse temperatures are regulated 
 by a central computer which works both
 the coal fired boiler and thermal     
 screens.  The newest greenhouse allows
 lorries inside to load delicate plants
 such as poinsettias at Christmas time.
 Mostly indoor plants are grown, many  
 of which go to the Sainsburys Homebase
 at Swindon for re-distribution.       
 Latest propagation techniques are     
 employed and plants are chemically    
 treated to stop pests and disease.
