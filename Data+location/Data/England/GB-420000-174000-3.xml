		<title>03Village tracks</title>
		<content> The ancient track called the Ridgeway 
 and an old railway track go through   
 the village. There are also a lot of  
 footpaths in and around Ogbourne St   
 George village.                       
 The Ridgeway was used in prehistoric  
 times. Many people come through the   
 village to explore the Ridgeway.      
 The railway was closed more than 20   
 years ago.Nowadays people take their  
 dogs along the railway track and      
 people ride horses and motorbikes     
 along it. It is now a good nature     
 reserve for plants and insects.       
 The footpaths are used by children as 
 safe places to play.They are popular  
 with hikers. People in the village use
 them as short cuts.
