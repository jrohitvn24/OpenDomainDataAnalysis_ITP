 religion that{Muslims}follow is called

 but they believe that Jesus was a     
 prophet. They believe that{Mohammed}  
 was the most important prophet.       
 Muslims pray five times a day.        
   Before entering the mosque Muslims  
 have to remove their shoes and socks  
 and do the following ritual; wash     
 hands once, their mouths, noses, ears 
 and arms three times; also wash their 
 faces, hair, necks and feet.This is   
 called{Al-Wushu.

 ensure that their legs are covered and
 that they have a scarf to cover their 
 heads. The boys just wear a hat and   
 their normal clothes.
