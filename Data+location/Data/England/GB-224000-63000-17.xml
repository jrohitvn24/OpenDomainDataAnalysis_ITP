  - Greetings from the children of     
 Liskeard.Some people think that       
 Cornish is a dead language,but it     
 isn't.In Liskeard only a few people   
 speak Cornish fluently,but in the     
 whole of Cornwall about 500 people    
 speak it well and 2000 to 3000 speak  
 some Cornish. By 1800 the Cornish     
 language had almost disappeared,being 
 replaced by English. Celtic languages 
 were being spoken all over Britain    
 when the Romans came. Cornish is      
 similar to Welsh and Breton which are 
 also Celtic languages.In our school a 
 few children learn Cornish but only   
 one boy speaks it fluently as he was  
 brought up speaking both Cornish and  
 English.
