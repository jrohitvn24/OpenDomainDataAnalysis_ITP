		<title>17Halewood - An Area of Change</title>
		<content>     Halewood has changed dramatically 
 over the last 40 years. In 1945 it was
 a small scattered village of around   
 2,000 people. There were only two     
 shops, these shops being a post office
 and a general store.                  
     Now it has many shops and a       
 population of over 20,000.            
     In the past many people worked on 
 the local farms and on the railway -  
 Halewood had its own station. Most of 
 the travel to and from work was by    
 bicycle or on foot.                   
     Most of the older residents       
 welcome the changes that have come as 
 life is easier, particularly on farms.
 Some would prefer to see the community
 spirit revived and less vandalism.    
 Welcome improvements are a good bus   
 service, more for school children to  
 do both at school and in organisations
 such as Brownies and Cubs.            </content>
