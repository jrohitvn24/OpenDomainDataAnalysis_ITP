		<title>11ROYAL BRITISH LEGION: BAND</title>
		<content> The aim of the R.B.L.is to raise money
 for the upkeep of the flats and       
 resthomes that many ex-servicemen     
 occupy. They also raise money for     
 local charities.                      
 In 1984 the R.B.L. members in Sutton  
 on Trent wanted to support the youth  
 of the village. It was decided to form
 a youth band. The band wears the      
 colours of the R.B.L.                 
 The band holds social functions in    
 order to raise funds for instruments  
 which the youth of the village are    
 taught to play.                       
                A ladies section raises
 funds for charitable works.           
                            The R.B.L. 
 in Sutton is an agency for social     
 events which have a base in charitable
 causes.
