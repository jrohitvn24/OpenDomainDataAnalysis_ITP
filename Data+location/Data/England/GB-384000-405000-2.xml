		<title>02SHOPPING IN MIDDLETON</title>
		<content>{SHOPPERS' OPINIONS}You can get all you
 need in Middleton from supermarkets,  
 general stores &amp; lots of local shops. 
 You get best buys &amp; bargains because  
 the supermarkets compete. {THE ARNDALE
{CENTRE}is convenient for shopping.    
 Everything is inside &amp; together but   
 disabled people &amp; mums with prams     
 can't get about easily.Some people say
 it is ugly.Most women have one big    
 shopping day (Thurs/Fri) &amp; use a car  
 or a taxi to carry it all home. More  
 free parking is needed &amp; the roadworks
 are a nuisance.{LOCAL SHOPS}are dearer
 but stay open late &amp; are useful for   
 fresh bread &amp; when you forget things  
 you go there. No big{DEPARTMENT STORES
 but people go to Manchester, Rochdale,
 Oldham &amp; Bury for those &amp; for more    
 choice in clothes and furniture. 80%  
 were against Sunday opening for all   
 shops.                                </content>
