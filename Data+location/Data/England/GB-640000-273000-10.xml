My name is Michael Welby and I am 8    
years old. I live in Narrow Way in a   
new house. I have 4 brothers and       
sisters, 2 of each. They fight a lot.  
My Dad works on an oil rig in the      
North Sea, he is an engineer. Dad      
flies from Norwich to Aberdeen, and    
then to the rig by helicopter. We like 
living in Wenhaston because there are  
lots of things to do and places to go. 
The school is quite old, but it is     
nice. I have lots of friends. I used   
to live in Lowestoft, but I didn't     
like it. The school was horrid. I like 
the work here, we use the computers a  
lot and we go for walks. We have been  
looking at lots of trees. I like       
reading and maths, but I don't always  
like writing.
