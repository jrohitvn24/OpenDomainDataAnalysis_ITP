		<title>09SWEET MAKING :HULL.</title>
		<content> When Fred Needler started making a few
 boiled sweets out of sugar cane over  
 an open fire in a tiny workshop,he    
 probably never dreamed that the       
 factory bearing his name would be     
 making 130 tons of sweets a week,a    
 hundred years later.                  
    All the sweets nowadays are made   
 from sugar beet,grown in East         
 Yorkshire,together with ingredients   
 from as far as America and Africa.    
    Although less than 500 people work 
 here now,compared with 1500 in 1940,a 
 lot more sweets are made today.This is
 because of the very modern machinery  
 and use of computers.                 
    Many of the sweets are exported    
 from the Hull docks in containers to  
 countries all over the world-a far cry
 from the days when Fred sold his      
 unwrapped sticky sweets from his horse
 and cart in the streets of Hull.      </content>
