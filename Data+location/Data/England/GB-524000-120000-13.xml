		<content> OFF GROUND BUDGE.                     
 The object of the game is to get off  
 the ground where you cannot be had but
 you have to move from place to place  
 without getting caught. Other people  
 can budge you off the ting you are on 
 and you can only stay on for 20 secs. 
 KIT THE CAN.We decide who is it and he
 counts to 50 fast. We have to get back
 to the big oak tree without being seen
 while he looks and defends the tree at
 the same time.If he sees someone he   
 shouts 1,2,3 seeyou(name). If someone 
 gets to the tree s/he shouts "Kit the 
 can". The s/he is it.                 
 CHAIN HE. This is banned because it is
 dangerous but we still play it. The it
 has to touch people and they all join 
 in a chain and chase after everyone   
 until they are all caught. The last   
 one is it next time.
