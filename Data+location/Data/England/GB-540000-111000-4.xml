		<title>04HAMSEYPLACE FARM AND HOUSE</title>
		<content> Hamseyplace Farm covers an area of{300
{acres.}Until recently it was almost   
 only a{dairy farm.}Now there are not  
 so many cattle as{more crops}are      
 grown, especially{wheat and barley.   
 This is due to the greater control of 
 drainage which has reduced risk of    
 flooding. The barn which was used to  
 house cattle and keep their winter    
 food has become important for storing 
 hay, drying grain and keeping the     
 tractor. The thatched is now replaced 
 by corrugated iron.                   
 The farmer now lives in a smaller     
 house in Offham as{12 years ago the   
{land and 17th century farmhouse were  
{sold off seperately.}This typical     
 Sussex farmhouse is a tile-hung,      
 timber framed house with stone        
 foundations. The present owners have  
 removed many of the 19th century room 
 divisions added to house servants.    </content>
