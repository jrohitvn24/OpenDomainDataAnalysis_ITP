		<title>05Sherborne St. John Plan</title>
		<content> In October 1980 the Secretary of State
 for the Environment approved the North
 East Hampshire Structure Plan, which  
 includes a local plan for Sherborne   
 St. John. Consultations were held with
 County and Parish Councils, groups and
 individual members of the community   
 about the draft proposals for land    
 development in the period ending in   
 1988, in which 55 new houses are      
 scheduled to be built. It is stated   
 that wherever possible buildings of   
 historic and/or architectural         
 importance are to be conserved, along 
 with the habitat and landscape. It    
 also suggests there will be a need to 
 develop shops to cater for villager's 
 needs and additional recreation       
 facilities. Traffic problems will also
 have to be looked at.
