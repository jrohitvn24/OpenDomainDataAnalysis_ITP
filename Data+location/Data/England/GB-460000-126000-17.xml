		<content> Pheasant shooting is quite important  
 during the season.  There are usually 
 at least 3 syndicate or private shoots
 in the area every year.  For syndicate
 shoots a fee is payable; people may   
 travel considerable distances to join 
 one of these shoots.  The pheasants   
 are bred in the area and released     
 into the wild for shooting.  Rabbits, 
 pigeons and hares are also shot, there
 is no shortage of these in this area; 
 it is likely they would become a      
 considerable pest if they were not    
 controlled in this way. Ferreting is  
 also a pastime of some local people.  
 The Ropley foxhounds hunt across the  
 area, though they are based 4 miles   
 away.
