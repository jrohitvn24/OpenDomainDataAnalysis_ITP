		<content> Caute is a small hamlet one and a half
 miles from the village of Shebbear. It
 contains one dairy farm, three        
 dwelling houses (one of which is the  
 headquarters of Stoneleigh Calf Farm) 
 and a small Baptist Church. This is an
 area with many Methodist chapels, and 
 parish churches, but here and there   
 among them is a Baptist place of      
 worship. The chapel goes back to      
 around 1850 and seats 70 people. It   
 has an average congregation of about  
 12 and meets for worship  once each   
 Sunday, alternately in the morning and
 in the afternoon. It is linked with   
 three other Baptist Churches all of   
 which share the same Minister.
