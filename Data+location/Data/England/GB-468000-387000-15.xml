		<content>  Bleak House Farm is in  group of     
 houses which might once have been     
 called Old Mattersey. There used to be
 5 farms but only one now works.  The  
 Gables, once a farmhouse, has been    
 converted into 3 separate cottages.   
 One of these has been empty for about 
 30 years. Next door are two more      
 cottages which used to be farm        
 buildings with a granary at the top.  
 Adjacent is Bleak House Farm which was
 built in 1797. All the original farm  
 buildings including a big barn and    
 dove cote are still there. During the 
 war the farmer had some Italian       
 prisoners of war helping work the     
 farm. They lived in one of the attics.
 Bleak House Farm stopped being a farm 
 about 20 years ago. At the bottom of  
 the road is The Poplars, which used to
 be a small farm but is now a big house
 with three grass fields.              </content>
