		<title>16LIFE IN FARLEY</title>
		<content>There was a small school in Farley at  
the turn of the century. The children  
now go mainly to the Faber School,     
Cotton and,afterwards,to state schools 
in Cheadle or Cotton and Denstone      
Colleges.Apart from a few business and 
professional people Farley is   main   
-ly a farming community and what were  
small farms twenty years ago,have been 
bought out by J.C.B.Farms Ltd. The     
village is surrounded by this estate.  
There is a daily bus service to Cheadle
and Uttoxeter,but there are no public  
facilities for recreation.  Cheadle    
Sports Centre is the nearest.One third 
of the population are Catholic and     
attend St.Wilfred's Church,Cotton.The  
remainder are mainly Church of England.
     Because of the proximity of Alton 
Towers,traffic in the village is heavy.
Accommodation is available at 10 pounds
for Bed and Breakfast.                 </content>
