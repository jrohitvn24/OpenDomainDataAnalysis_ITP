		<content> A very important business in Horam is 
 the Merrydown Cider Factory.It was    
 founded in 1946 by Jack Wood and Ian  
 Howie.Today it is the fourth largest  
 cider producer in Britain and         
 produces the strongest cider with 7.5%
 alcohol.One hundred and thirty people 
 work there.During August and September
 apples are brought from the orchards  
 to be processed,the rest of the year  
 from cold stores.All apples are Kent  
 or Sussex grown.First they are washed 
 and pressed. The press holds eight    
 tons of apples and in 1.5 hours       
 squeezes out 1,200g of juice.This is  
 pumped into oak vats and there sugar  
 and yeast is added and the mixture    
 left for two to three months.Cider is 
 produced and then stored for another  
 nine months to develop its flavour.It 
 is bottled, an automatic bottling     
 machine filling about 35,000 per day. </content>
