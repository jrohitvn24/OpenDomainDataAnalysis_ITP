		<content> From our survey we found that less    
 than 10% of families go regularly to  
 church.Many went shopping at garden   
 centres, D.I.Y. centres and the Sunday
 Market. Sunday is bath night!{REPORTS 
    Sundays are the only days I get any
 rest.Even though it is one of my best 
 days there are things I don't like    
 about it. There are no really good    
 television programmes on.On Sundays we
 usually have a roast meal and a       
 pudding.For tea we just have a snack  
 like sandwiches and an apple.On Sunday
 my sister and I go swimming.          
 Because we swim on Sunday we do not   
 have much time to go shopping.Sunday  
 lunch is normally roast chicken.In the
 afternoon  we go round Fleet Pond     
 ,Helen and I take our bikes and       
 Dad walks.For tea we normally have a  
 cake like swiss roll.I wouldn't like  
 Sundays to be change.                 </content>
