		<content> With Elland Road Football Stadium, the
 home of Leeds United Football Club,   
 being in our survey area we thought it
 would be interesting to find out how  
 many local people visited the ground  
 to watch soccer.                      
  We found from our survey that only   
 that only 40% of those we interviewed 
 watched any live sport at all. Of     
 these people only 38% watched soccer  
 and 48% watched rugby league.         
  There are about 10 rugby league teams
 in the area including Hunslet who are 
 a professional team.Hunslet now Share 
 Elland Road Stadium with Leeds United 
 and have done since the start of the  
 1983/84 season.This is possible       
 because soccer is played on Saturday  
 and Rugby on Sunday.                  
  Perhaps people have been put off     
 attending soccer matches because of   
 crowd trouble at soccer games.        </content>
