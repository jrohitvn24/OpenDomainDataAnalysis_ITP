		<title>15Our Hopes and Fears Mossley</title>
		<content> The children of class 1 at Mossley    
 C.E.Primary School decided that some  
 thoughts about the future would be of 
 interest and value to readers  and    
 researchers in years to come.They     
 considered their 'hopes and fears'with
 some interesting results.             
      The one issue that dominates     
 their thoughts is Nuclear             
 War.50% of the class say this is      
 their greatest fear. Their strongest  
 hope is for peace in the world.Nearly 
 30% hope for a One Nation World.25% of
 the class are worried about the       
 destruction of the Tropical Rain      
 Forests.Other issues which are        
 relevant are'finding a job,feeding the
 world,vandalism,cures for             
 illnesses.Some are worried that       
 computers and robots will 'take       
 over'.Others look forward to links    
 with life from other galaxies.        </content>
