		<title>09Great Horwood Ghosts</title>
		<content> Like most villages, Great Horwood has 
its share of {Ghost Stories}.          
            {Nansley's Brake}          
  One day a woman went for a walk with 
her dog through Nansley's Brake, not   
noticing a well ahead of her, she      
tripped and fell in. Her dog's head    
caught on an overhanging branch which  
decapitated him. On misty nights her   
ghost walks through the brake with her 
headless dog.                          
    {The Ghost called Mary}            
 One villager told us about a ghost    
they call Mary. She is a happy ghost,  
she likes Christmas and hates changes. 
The villager has seen the ghost, she   
wears yellow clothing and is quite     
young. Once when the villager was      
baking a cake, she got out a cake tin, 
turned round and the tin disappeared   
never to be seen again.
