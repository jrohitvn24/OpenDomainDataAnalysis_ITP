		<content> WE LIKE TO PLAY GAMES AT WEEKENDS, IN 
 THE HOLIDAYS AND AT PLAYTIME IN       
 SCHOOL. THERE ARE LOTS OF GAMES AND WE
 ALL KNOW THE RULES AND TEACH TEM TO   
 NEW CHILDREN. SOME OF THE GAMES ARE   
 PLAYED WITH BALLS OR ROPES AND SOME   
 HAVE SONGS. THIS GAME CAN BE PLAYED BY
 LOTS OF CHILDREN..{...................
{STUCK IN THE MUD.}ONE PERSON IS "IT"  
 AND CHASES THE OTHERS. IF YOU         
 ARECAUGHT YOU MUST STAND WITH YOUR    
 LEGS APART AND ONE OF THE OTHER       
 RUNNERS WILL TRY TO FREE YOU BY       
 CRAWLING BETWEEN YOUR LEGS. THEN YOU  
 CAN JOIN IN THE GAME AGAIN. THE GAME  
 ENDS WHEN EVERYONE IS "STUCK" AND     
 THERE IS NO ONE LEFT TO FREE THEM.    
 OTHER GAMES AREBRITISH
