		<content> On a Wednesday night at six o'clock   
 there is a fishing competion.We wait  
 until a man comes and then we pay     
 twenty pence, which is how much it    
 costs to enter, and then we pick a    
 piece of card with a number on it and 
 then we walk up the bank until we come
 to the peg number that matches the one
 we have on the card we picked out of  
 the bag.Then we have until half past  
 six to tackle up.Then at quarter to   
 nine we pack up and the organisers    
 come round and way our catch.If you   
 win you get a trophy which has a metal
 fisherman on it.It is also based on an
 aggregate over thirteen weeks so you  
 get 15 points for 1st,14 points for   
 2nd and so on.Then the winner over the
 thirteen weeks gets a cup and the top 
 15 over all get into the leamington   
 team who fish againts other teams all 
 over warwickshire.                    </content>
