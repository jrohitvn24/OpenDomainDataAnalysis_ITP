		<title>07EASTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Easton village is part of the Easston 
 hall Estate belonging to Sir Montague 
 Cholmeley. Easton hall, after being   
 taken over by the paratroops(who went 
 to Arnhem) during the second world    
 war, was demolished in 1950 on the    
 decision of his father Sir Hugh       
 Chomlmeley , due to its over-large    
 size and the high cost of repairs. The
 stone lions At the gate of the Dower  
 House nearby were brought over from   
 the hall.THe village houses are stone 
 built except for two red brick, and   
 together with the well kept gardens,  
 ablaze with old-fashioned flowers such
 as lupins, peonies, hollyhocks, red   
 hot pockers and irisies, make a most  
 attractive scene. Though they are not 
 owner occupied, the Dwellings are     
 obviously maintained with pride. Ofthe
 people living in Easton  only 2 are   
 employees of the estate.              </content>
