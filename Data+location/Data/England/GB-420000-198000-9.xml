		<content>  {St. Mary's Church,}Buscot, in the   
 diocese of Oxford, was built in the   
 early C13th. It is small and in the   
 countryside. Services are held on the 
 first and third Sundays of the month. 
 The vicar also takes services at Great
 Coxwell, Coleshill and Eaton Hastings.
 The Church of St. John the{Baptist,   
{Inglesham, is a Norman}building with  
 box pews. It is not used any more and 
 is in the care of the Redundant       
 Churches Fund.                        
   The Lechlade Churches joined        
 together on May 19th. 1985 for a      
 "Songs Of Praise" service and again in
 July for a Flower Festival when many  
 of the town clubs displayed flowers in
 the churches.                         
   Regular services are held in the    
 Parish Church by the Primary School.  
 Half of these take the form of a      
 Eucharist.                            </content>
