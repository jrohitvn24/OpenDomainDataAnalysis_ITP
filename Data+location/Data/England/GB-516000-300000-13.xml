 employers are helping Sudan and       
 Ethiopia.                             
    Sudan, which is one of the         
 countries struck by famine, has       
 reveived one of Perkins Engines' own  
 4.236 diesel engines.                 
    Th engine will be used to power a  
 pumping unit which has been given to a
 person from the Sudanese government   
 three days ago at the factory.        
    The pumping unit is worth Â£5,500   
 and is able to pump 53,000 gallons per
 hour at a maximun height of 42        
 metres.The project has been organised 
 by the aid organisation "Christian    
 Outreach".
