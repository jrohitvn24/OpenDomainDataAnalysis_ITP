		<title>11DAY IN THE LIFE OF A FARMER</title>
		<content> A typical day for me would be, get up 
 at 5.45am have drink, start work 6.15,
 let the cows into the collecting yard 
 and start the milking machine.I milk  
 in a herring bone parlour with 10     
 cows on each side. When finished,     
 milking equipment is washed.9.00am    
 breakfast. Next I scrape the yard and 
 pump the slurry into the slurry       
 tower.I feed the cows and calves and  
 bed with straw.12.00 _ 1.00 dinner    
 then out into the fields to repair    
 barbed wire fences.3.00 break for     
 drink.I move the  electric fence fire 
 at the silage face to give the        
 cows more to eat.Milk the cows        
 again and clean equipment when        
 finished I shut the cows into the     
 cubicle house,check they are all well 
 and separate a few that are due to    
 calve. 6.00 tea                       
                                       </content>
