		<content> Most of Ludney Farm has been in the   
 family for 300 years,they bought more 
 land 43 years ago to enlarge the farm.
 All of the family works on the        
 farm.They like farming because there  
 is so much variety,they especially    
 enjoy the baby animals.The family has 
 decided to keep the hedges around the 
 farm and not to rip them out.They do  
 use modern equipment though,they have 
 a combine harvester;8 tractors;an     
 industrial digger and a potato        
 harvester.They use about 120 tons of  
 fertiliser per year.                  
 The EEC dairy quotas have not really  
 affected them,because they decided to 
 cut down on 'quality foods'instead,if 
 they had not cut down they would have 
 had to 'lose' 10 cows.At the moment   
 they produce 516884 litres of milk per
 year.
