		<title>03The village school</title>
		<content> Draycott in the Clay has a            
 coeducational Church of England       
 controlled first school with 58       
 pupils. The childrens' ages range     
 from 4 to 9 and they are divided into 
 3 classes. Most of the children live  
 in Draycott but a minibus brings 8    
 children from Marchington Woodlands   
 and isolated houses en route.         
                                       
 The school was opened on April 26th   
 1966; it replaced the former school   
 which is now used as the village hall.
 It is set in farmland and has views   
 across open country towards Hanbury.  
                                       
 The school is very well thought of    
 by the local villagers and is         
 enthusiastically supported in all its 
 activities.
