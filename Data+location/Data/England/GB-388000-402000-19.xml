		<content>   People in our area make full use of 
 their local shops. There are large    
 numbers of elderly people in the      
 locality and convenience is important 
 to them. Many people are willing to   
 pay more in the corner shop for the   
 sake of convenience. There are many   
 shops in the neighbourhood selling    
 things such as milk, bread, tobacco   
 and sweets. Items like these are often
 bought on the spur of the moment and  
 people are not willing to go far for  
 these things. There are some          
 shoppers, however, who prefer the     
 greater choice and cheaper prices that
 the supermarket can offer. Car-owning 
 shoppers would be more likely to visit
 superstores where they could do a     
 whole week's shopping in one trip.
