		<content>{Health Care in the Probus Area}       
 About 30 years ago Probus had 3       
 doctors in practise with consulting &amp; 
 waiting rooms behind one doctor's     
 house.Now with the increase in        
 population there are 4 doctors with a 
 new,attractively airy,purpose_built   
 surgery on the edge of the village.It 
 was suggested that the field it       
 overlooked should become a cemetery   
 but after consideration this was not  
 considered appropriate!They do their  
 own dispensing as there is no chemist 
 in the village &amp; the dispensary window
 is well_barred as is necessary nowa_  
 days.They have weekly diabetic,infant 
 welfare,family_planning &amp; "Well Women"
 clinics &amp; also a chiropody service.   
 Nowadays there is greater emphasis on 
 preventative medicine as people are   
 willing to consult their doctors more 
 frequently.                           </content>
