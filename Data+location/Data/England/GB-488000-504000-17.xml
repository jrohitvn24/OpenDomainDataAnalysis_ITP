		<content> The main means of communications for  
 the people of Littlebeck,             
 Sneatonthorpe and the farms on the    
 moors is the telephone. The telephone 
 wires are overhead and during the     
 winter, when the snow is very heavy   
 communications are very often cut off.
 Many farmers now have Citizens Band   
 radios and are able to communicate    
 with each other when the telephone    
 system is out of order.               
 Most people in the area now have      
 television and video recorders but    
 reception in Littlebeck is limited to 
 some houses under the hill and only   
 one television channel is obtainable. 
 There is, however, an aerial to       
 improve the service.
