		<title>06Cramlington:A Typical Family</title>
		<content> The "Browns" are similar to many      
 families in the town. Mr.Brown is a   
 fitter in a factory in Blyth, where he
 goes each day in his 3 year old car.  
 His wife works as a packer in a       
 factory on the nearby industrial      
 estate, but only in the evenings.The  
 two Brown children go to the local    
 First School, a short walk from the   
 semi-detached house they live in.     
 Mr.Brown owns this, and is thinking of
 making it bigger in case the family   
 grows. He enjoys working in his       
 garden, and playing squash at         
 Concordia, the local sports centre.   
 His wife goes there,too, to swim and  
 to play badminton. His son and        
 daughter play out on their bikes a    
 lot, and have a computer to share.    
 Each year they go on holiday to Spain,
 by bus to an apartment.
