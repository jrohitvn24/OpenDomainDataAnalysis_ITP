		<title>04ALTON WATER RESERVOIR  P.1</title>
		<content>                                       
    One of the biggest changes in      
recent years was the building of the   
Alton Water Reservoir.The eight million
pound reservoir is between the villages
of Tattingstone,Holbrook and Stutton.  
Prior to the bulding of the reservoir  
the demand for water in the area was   
rising at a rate of about 6% a year.   
The water for this area was obtained   
from local supplies of underground     
water in the chalk of the Gipping      
Valley which could not meet the demand.
    The reservoir was started in 1972  
and finished by 1978 and covers about  
400 acres of the Alton Valley.It       
supplies much needed water to farms    
industrial firms and a population of   
245,000 throughout the Ipswich area.   
The reservoir holds about 2,000,000,000
gallons of water.It also provides an   
amenity for the Ipswich area.          </content>
