 There are very few entertainment      
 facilities in Lacock and although the 
 children enjoy playing in the playing 
 field, the teenagers and young adults 
 are not so happy with the situation.  
 There are several pubs, but no discos 
 or clubs and few possibilities for    
 youth clubs etc.  Such amenities may  
 be found in Chippenham and a sports   
 centre can also be found in Melksham, 
 but public transport, especially at   
 night, is limited and this prevents   
 many from enjoying them.
