		<content>Rugeley is in the middle of England and
in the centre of Staffordshire. We live
in the valley of the River Trent. We   
have the Trent and Mersey canal and the
railway from Glasgow to London. The    
main road (A51) goes northwards to     
Chester and southwards to Tamworth to  
join the A5 to London. The highest land
is Etching Hill, it is 138m above sea  
level. There is a large population in  
the south eastern area of the block    
otherwise the population is quite      
sparse. There is an area of deciduous  
woodland and heathland to the south    
west and the Trent Valley is a mixture 
of grazing pastures and fine           
grasslands. The Western area is all    
privately owned land, the majority in  
the ownership of Sir Charles Wolseley  
whose family has owned it for over 1000
years.
