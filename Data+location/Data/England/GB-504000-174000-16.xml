 Dr Collins gets up at half past six,  
 the radio wakes him up. He drives for 
 15min to get to work. First he looks  
 at the mail and then any problems.    
 Surgery starts at nine o'clock. He    
 sees each patient for about five      
 minutes. Then he visits patients too  
 ill to come to the surgery. He usually
 finishes at half past six. Sometimes  
 he stays in Stanwell overnight incase 
 of emergencies.                       
                                       
{Dr Grigg}                             
 Dr Grigg came to school to talk to us 
 because he knows so much about the    
 History of Stanwell. He showed us his 
 collection of pictures. He lives in a 
 house that used to be the old police  
 station. He was very interesting, we  
 learned a lot and he was happy.
