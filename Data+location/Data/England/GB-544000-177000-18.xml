If I was in charge I would stop all    
countries using the H bomb. I would    
stop all people using the H bomb       
because they make too much damage and  
the people have no reason for using it.
Also they don't need to fight.         
                                       
I would make children warm when they go
to bed and not hungry because otherwise
they will die and be ill. Back in      
England or other countries some people 
eat for the sake of eating.            
                                       
I would stop people killing animals    
because they kill them for no reason   
and they could eat other things than   
animals.
