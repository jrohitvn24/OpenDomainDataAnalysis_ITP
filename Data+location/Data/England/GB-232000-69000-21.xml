<title>21Golberdon &amp; Berrio in South Hill Parish</title>
<content>

We moved here in January 2003 and live in an old corn mill in Berrio just 200m west along from Kerney Bridge mentioned in the first article. Little has changed in the centre of the village as far as I can tell with the exception that the chapel has closed and has now been converted into a home. The village hall is doing well and now boasts a new children's playground with the latest facilities. I must confess I have never been on a bus since I moved here, but suspect that the fare to Callington is now more than 20p. We have been responsible for the main change in our part of the village, now occupying the whole of the mill and running two holiday cottages which are conversions (since 2005) of an old cow shippon (barn). The builder is a son of a local farmer. The plumber and electrician are also local farmers. It appears that many people in Cornwall have more than one occupation and they work very long hours. With this in mind, we also run a small food business in the mill. The main revolution and change, in common with the rest of the country is the introduction of broadband communications allowing business's like our own to operate through the internet. I am now also carrying out website work taking advantage of the facilities available. This is a common feature of many other home based business's in the area. In the last seven years the River Lynher has flooded 4 times, but with no detrimental effect to our land which is along 600 metres on the North side.   &lt;br />
