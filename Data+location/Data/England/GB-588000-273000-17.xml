1.We saw some houses; there was a      
cottage which had a pantiled roof and  
flint walls. Another house had         
cream,grey,and peach  walls, and       
behind the back of shepherd's  house   
there were some barns. The roof was    
made of slate and grey walls.          
                                       
2 The main crop in the fields was      
barley and the other crop we saw was   
the sugarbeat.                         
                                       
                                       
3 We walked past a forest of mixed     
trees and far off in the distance was a
pinewood.
