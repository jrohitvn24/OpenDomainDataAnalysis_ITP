		<content> Whitbourne Hall  a Victorian Mansion  
 (1862).It belongs to the family who   
 ran a successful vinegar factory.     
 They now live in a house by the lake  
 .Bill,their son,now owns the building.
 All the rooms are now being sold to   
 make into flats.Bill's bedroom is now 
 a 7 roomed house up stairs and down.  
 My Uncle Dave bought two rooms which  
 he has made in to flats.There are     
 lovely gardens and a maze and a       
 orangery but there is no glass in in  
 it at present.There are four rooms    
 that are still used in there proper   
 way.There is a ball room with a       
 chandelier.A dining room with a huge  
 table and a study with loads of books.

 the heads.Round the the front there   
 are some beautiful pillars.
