		<content> Shaft mining methods for the          
 extraction of ball clay commenced     
 about 1870 and continued until 1960.{ 
 Today however underground mining is   
 carried out by the adit method in     
 which the main tunnel is driven to    
 follow the dip of the clay seam to a  
 horizontal distance underground which 
 is usually of the order of 900 to 1000
 metres.Clay extraction takes place    
 from levels which are driven at right 
 angles to the main tunnel.The clay is 
 won either by using a mining machine  
 or by hand_operated compressed air    
 spades and winched to the surface in  
 small rail trucks. Using the adit     
 method clay is extracted from vertical
 depths of 150 to 200 meters.Recently  
 underground working has become        
 increasingly uneconomic and this      
 activity is now being reduced.
