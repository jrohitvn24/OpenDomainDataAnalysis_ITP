		<title>19OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> 41 children come to this school from a
 wide and scattered area:from the A    
 6071 road on the west to a point about
 five miles east of the school.Most of 
 the children are brought in by        
 transport paid for by Cumbria         
 Education Authority.Because of        
 declining school rolls Walton School  
 and Lees Hill School were amalgamated 
 on this site in April 1971. This      
 school employs 2.3(two and three      
 tenths)teachers. The school is divided
 into three classes on three mornings  
 of the week and into two for the rest 
 of the time. We begin morning school  
 at 9.00 and end at noon.Afternoon     
 school begins at 13.00 and ends at    
 15.30.There is a break in the morning 
 session of 15 minutes and in the      
 afternoon of 10 minutes.Many of our   
 school documents have been deposited  
 with the County Archivist.            </content>
