		<title>01OVERVIEW OF LONGSTANTON AREA</title>
		<content> This area is made up mainly of parts  
 of two rural parishes:{LONGSTANTON}   
 (population 2860) and{ LOLWORTH}(130).
 It is bisected by the busy A604 trunk 
 road,running NE from Cambridge to     
 Huntington. Being almost on the edge  
 of the Fens, the terrain is very flat,
 varying little in height from a mean  
 of 15m above sea level. It is         
 excellent arable farmland, and almost 
 all non-residential land is under     
 cultivation. In Longstanton there is a
 little light industry, but neither    
 village provides much on-the-spot     
 employment. Most workers commute daily
 to Cambridge (about 8 miles); a few go
 as far as London. Both villages have a
 high proportion of residents who are  
 not "true village" people. Both have  
 seen considerable building in recent  
 years. Longstanton has a large Army   
 barracks on its outskirts.            </content>
