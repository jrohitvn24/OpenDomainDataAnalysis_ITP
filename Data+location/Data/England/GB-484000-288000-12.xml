		<content>Rockingham Triangle recreation area was
originally farmland. Now converted for 
rugby, soccer, cricket,athletics,      
gaelic football and in the future      
American football. A fenced arena has  
just been completed for the use of     
Corby Town football and athletic clubs.
The athletics track will be the first  
in the county with a regional standard 
surface. In addition to its all        
weather, eight lane running track, the 
stadium has a covered seating stand for
up to 1000 spectators. Clubs using the 
council pitches, rent them on a casual 
or block hire scheme. The current rate 
for the hire of a pitch with changing  
facilities is #16.55 per game. Teams   
can make a block hiring and obtain a 36
match concession for #132. This would  
give them exclusive use of the area for
the period of their contract.
