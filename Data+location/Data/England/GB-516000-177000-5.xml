		<content> The importance of{St.Marys Church}is  
 different than it would have been 200 
 years ago.Up to then it was the{oldest
{church in town,}and up to about 120   
 years ago it was the only church in   
 town.It goes back in history to about 
 the{11th century.}It's important      
 historically and it's important in    
 that it has the{biggest congregation  
{in Ealing.                            
       The clubs and organisations the 
 church organizes are fewer than there 
 would have been 20 years ago because  
 now the church tends to set up mixed  
 organisations to make up a christian  
 family.                               
      {Prebendary Saward}has lived in  
 Ealing for seven years and does not   
 think this part of Ealing has had a   
 major change in that time.
