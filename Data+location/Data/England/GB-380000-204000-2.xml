		<title>02A419 - THE OLD AND NEW ROAD</title>
		<content>      The A419 runs from Stroud to     
 Stonehouse and also feeds the M.5. It 
 carries heavy local traffic as well as
 a great deal of motorway traffic.It is
 a narrow bendy road that passes       
 through Ebley Village with its several
 listed buildings.The heavy traffic is 
 noisy,smelly,dangerous and damages the
 buildings which border the road.      
      Mrs.D.Tucker,the secretary of the
 Ebley Village Bypass Action Group,said
 that the last traffic count showed    
 that it was the busiest road in the   
 county except for the motorway.       
      A new road is to be started in   
 April 1988.This will be to the south  
 of the present road and canal along   
 the route of the disused railway line.
 The old road will remain and hopefully
 Ebley will become a quiet friendly    
 village again.
