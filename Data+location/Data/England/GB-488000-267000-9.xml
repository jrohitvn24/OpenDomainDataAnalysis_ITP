		<title>09A LEVEL CHOICES AT 16 PLUS.</title>
		<content> During the last two years of my life I
 found the Geography O level one of the
 most interesting subjects I took and  
 on asking others who took the A level 
 and found it carried on in this way , 
 I decided to continue with it as an A 
 level choice .Maths is also a subject 
 I find interesting but I also have a  
 mathematically inclined brain as      
 opposed to an art-type brain and find 
 processes involving numbers           
 interesting .Economics was suggested  
 to me as a good choice of subject to  
 go with Maths and Geography and       
 involves some Maths and keeps up to   
 date with present society.I chose     
 these subjects with no career in mind 
 but because I enjoyed them and was    
 able to do them.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
