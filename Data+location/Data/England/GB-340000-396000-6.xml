		<title>06A Town House in Kirkby</title>
		<content> My name is Susan. I live in a Town    
 House. We have 2 bedrooms. We have 6  
 rooms altogether. Inside our house we 
 have a gas cooker, an electric fire   
 and gas central heating. We have a    
 front and a back garden. At the front 
 of our house and at the  back there   
 are Town Houses.                      
 In our street there are no shops,     
 phone boxes, post boxes, garages,     
 factories, offices or trees. We do not
 have double glazing or extensions. Our
 house was built in 1973 and my mum and
 dad chose it because they had no other
 choice.                               
 There are a number of amenities near  
 our house. There is a pub, a health   
 clinic and a shop.                    
 Both of my parents work. My mum is a  
 store's assistant and my dad is a     
 newsagent manager but he used to be a 
 butcher.                              </content>
