		<title>14My Hobby- Stamford Bridge</title>
		<content> Mr. Bishop came to school to          
 tell us about his hobby which is bird 
 watching." When I was a little boy of 
 11 years I lived in a village the same
 size as Stamford Bridge.Because I was 
 in the countryside I was naturally    
 interested in wildlife,especially     
 birds.I enjoy watching all kinds      
 of birds from Blackbirds in the garden
 to more unusual ones like the         
 Nightjar.Although I will  go anywhere 
 birdwatching, I also like to go to    
 bird reserves,like Wheldrake Ings     
 in Yorkshire which has some of the    
 rarest birds in Europe, such as the   
 Bittern.I take binnoculars and a      
 telescope with me and can happily sit 
 all day watching the birds.The most   
 exciting time I can remember is when  
 I spotted a Purple Heron.Once I nearly
 fell into the sea when I was trying to
 get close to some sea birds."         </content>
