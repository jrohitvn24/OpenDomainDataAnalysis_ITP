  Christopher Driscoll, Age 13:        
Football is very popular. There are 2  
professional teams in the area: West   
Ham in the First Division and Orient in
the Fourth. Paul Miller of Spurs and   
and Les Sealy of Luton were born in    
Bethnal Green. Scouts from big clubs   
come to our school to watch boys play; 
our team is very good with a history of
cups and championships.                
  Martin Kelly, Age 14: Charlie Magri  
is our World Flyweight Champion. He was
born on July 20th 1956, had 140 fights 
as an amateur, turned professional in  
1978 and became champion in 1983       
beating Eloncio Mercedes in Round 7.   
Managed by Terry Lawless and trained by
Frank Black, Charlie has George Wiggs  
as 'Corner Man' to deal with cuts. His 
aim is to box for another year then run
his shop at 345 Bethnal Green Road.    </content>
