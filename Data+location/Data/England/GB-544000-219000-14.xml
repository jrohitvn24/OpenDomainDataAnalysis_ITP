		<title>14 STORTFORD FIRE STATION</title>
		<content>The fire &amp; ambulance station at Patmore
Close,Hadham Road,was opened in 1970.  
There are 2 fire engines plus spare &amp;  
support vehicles.12 full &amp; 5 part-time 
officers are employed.There are 2      
ambulances &amp; 1 support vehicle for     
walking wounded.13 drivers &amp; assistants
are employed.Staff shortages are a     
problem.The area served includes the   
whole of Bishop's Stortford,westwards  
to the Hadhams &amp; northwards to         
Braughing,Stocking &amp; Furneux Pelham &amp;  
even Saffron Walden.There are between  
12 &amp; 15 emergency calls per week,about 
600 calls per year.Traffic congestion  
on the A1250 2 lane road which all     
vehicles have to use means increasing  
delays for both services.
