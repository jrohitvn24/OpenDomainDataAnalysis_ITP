		<content> This area of great natural beauty and 
 varied scenery, pastureland, woodland 
 and moorland, lies within the North   
 Yorkshire Moors National Park.        
 Two thirds of the land is cultivated, 
 some under cash crops, but most under 
 pasture and fodder crops for dairy    
 cattle and sheep. Higher ground       
 provides rough grazing. This gives    
 away to moorland, supporting its own  
 wildlife, and reared game. 900 people 
 live within the area, mostly in the   
 larger village of Osmotherly. Forty   
 people live in Thimbleby, others in   
 outlying farmsteads. Most houses are  
 built from local quarried sandstone.  
 Few people work on the land.  A       
 sawmill, publichouses and garages     
 employ local people.  Most of the     
 working population commute to         
 Northallerton and Teeside, where most 
 bulk shopping is done. In winter      </content>
