		<title>16WHITNASH CEMETERY.</title>
		<content>   Whitnash Cemetery is in Brunswick   
 Street.It was originally used as      
 farmland. Whitnash Cemetery took up   
 about 1/12 of our square so we decided
 to go and find out information about  
 it.There are 11 acres of land.The     
 cemetery was first used in 1851.      
                                       
   Warwickshire District Council became
 responsible for the cemetery in 1974. 
 The averge number of burials a year is
 155.There are 4 full time employees at
 the cemetery and 5 in the summer. The 
 graves are dug by a mechanical digger.
                                       
   A log book including the names of   
 all the buried is kept at Regent      
 Square in Leamington Spa.             
 The most famous person buried there   
 is Randolph Turpin the boxer.
