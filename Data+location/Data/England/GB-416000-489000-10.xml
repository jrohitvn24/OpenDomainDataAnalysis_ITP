		<title>10LEISURE ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content>   As in many rural areas,the          
{facilities}available for leisure      
 activities are not so great as those  
 in towns.For example those wishing to 
 go to the cinema must travel some     
 miles to Northallerton.There are      
 sometimes amateur shows put on at     
 nearby Leyburn but the nearest        
 professional theatre is the Georgian  
 Theatre at Richmond.Swimming baths are
 also at Richmond.Cubs,Scouts,Brownies 
 and Guides are at Leyburn.In Leyburn  
 there are also the local sports clubs.
                                       
   In the area itself there are        
 opportunities for walking,fishing or  
 birdwatching.Ladies can meet monthly  
 at the Women's Institute.There is the 
 occasional whist or domino drive.Many 
 people meet and talk in the evenings  
 at the local pub.Young Farmers groups 
 meet each week.                       </content>
