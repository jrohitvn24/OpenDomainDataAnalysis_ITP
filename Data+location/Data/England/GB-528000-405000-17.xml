		<title>17NURSERY EDUCATION</title>
		<content> There is, in 1985, no State Nursery   
 Education available in Humberston.    
 There are three part-time play-groups 
 which are well supported by local     
 families.There is,however, a growing  
 demand for Nursery Education. The     
 falling rolls situation created some  
 surplus accommodation in the County   
 Infants School. The Education         
 Authority has offered Nursery Training
 to staff and local teachers have taken
 advantage of this course. These       
 factors have encouraged parents in    
 their action to bring Nursery         
 Education within reach of Humberston  
 children.In May 1985 a parent's       
 petition was presented to the         
 Education Authority via the School    
 Governing Body, asking for a local    
 Nursery.98 children's names were      
 listed - future pupils who could enjoy
 the facilities of a Nursery School.   </content>
