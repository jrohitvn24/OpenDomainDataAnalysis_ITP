At Elms Farm there is a carpenter.  He 
has got one helper and uses about three
large machines.  The carpenter makes   
furniture and repairs antiques but the 
best and most important thing is that  
he makes mendlesham chairs.  Mendlesham
chairs have been made in the area since
about 1780.  They are wooden chairs    
with arms and have at least three      
bobbles and a carved bar on the        
back.  The chairs can be made out of   
pine, cherry, elm or walnut and can be 
made in different sizes.  The          
carpenter takes orders and makes them  
specially to order for people.  They   
take a long time to make and cost      
about 400 pounds to buy.  There are two
very old mendlesham chairs in the      
church.
