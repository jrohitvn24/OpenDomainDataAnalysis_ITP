		<content>  Compare this with the 1980-1985      
 register:1 milkman,soldier,teacher,   
 farm manager,computer manager,police  
 officer and 2nursery men are recorded.
  The burial register 1839-1841 shows  
 most of the deaths to be of the very  
 young,age 65years being the exception.
 During 1985 the deaths have been      
 mainly of the old and the very old.The
 oldest being 91 years and the youngest
 by far being 48 years.                
  The influx of people who do not need 
 to rely on the land for their living  
 has brought a luxury quality to the   
 area which makes it increasingly      
 difficult for the local inhabitants to
 continue living in the same way that  
 they have done,perhaps for            
 generations. To redress the balance   
 new businesses and investment are     
 needed to replace the declining       
 dependence on the land.               </content>
