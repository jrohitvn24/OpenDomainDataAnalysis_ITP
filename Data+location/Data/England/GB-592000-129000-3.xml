		<content> MOST OF THE VILLAGERS WORKED ON THE   
 LAND OR AS CRAFTSMEN SERVING THE      
 FARMERS. THE FARMING DEPRESSIONS      
 IN THE 19TH CENTURY BOUGHT POVERTY.   
 SOME EMIGRATED IN DESPAIR TO CANADA   
 AND AUSTRALIA. OTHERS, AFTER THE      
 RAILWAY ARRIVED IN 1851 FOUND         
 EMPLOYMENT UN ASHFORD AND RYE.        
 EDUCATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY THE    
 CHURCH FOR CENTURIES, AND IN 184O IT  
 BUILT THE PRESENT VILLAGE SCHOOL,     
 GIVING THE CHILDREN THE CHANCE OF     
 WIDER OPPORTUNITIES.                  
 APPLEDORE WAS NOT A HEALTHY PLACE FOR 
 MOST OF ITS HISTORY. UNDRAINED MARSHES
 BROUGHT MARSH FEVER. THE ROYAL        
 MILITARY CANAL DID MUCH TO CURE THIS  
 TROUBLE AND APPLEDORE HAS BECOME A    
 PLACE RO WHICH PEOPLE RETIRE,         
 INTRODUCING A NEW ELEMENT IN THE      
 COMMUNITY, BUT MANY OLD APPLEDORE     
 FAMILIES REMAIN UPHOLDING TRADITIONS. </content>
