		<content>     The Preston Guild is a festival to
 commemorate a meeting where a         
 stock_taking took place. The first    
 Guild was held in 1328. Since the 16th
 Century, it had been a rule that the  
 Guild Merchant should take place every
 20 years commencing on the Monday     
 following the Feast of the beheading  
 of St.John. The first Guild this      
 Century was in 1902. There was no     
 Guild in 1942 because of World War II.
 In 1952 thousands turned out to a     
 reception by the Mayor. Processions go
 through the streets of Preston for a  
 week. The Guild Hall was built for the
 1972 Guild when Concorde flew over.   
 During this 1972 Guild, a large fair  
 was held on Moor Park. A schools'     
 festival presented "Camelot" and      
 "Prospect of Preston". The next Guild 
 will take place in 1992.
