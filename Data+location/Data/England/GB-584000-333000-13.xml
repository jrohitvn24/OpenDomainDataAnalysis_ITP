		<title>13POPULATION, S CREAKE</title>
		<content> The population of S Creake hovers     
 around 580.  The number has risen in  
 the last few years due to incomers,   
 consisting of retired people and      
 holiday home owners.                  
 The number of people living in the    
 village in the first census in 1801   
 was 625, rising to 1085 in 1861,      
 falling slowly to 750 in 1911 and     
 to 400 in 1971.                       
 We have still, just enough children to
 support the village primary school, 46
 pupils.                               
 About 95 pensioners draw their money  
 from the S Creake Post Office, with   
 ten or more having payment into their 
 bank accounts.                        
 Apart from our Priest-in-charge, there
 are no practising professional people 
 in the village.                       
 The schoolmaster lives elsewhere.
