The area is dotted with isolated farms,
smallholdings and scattered hamlets.   
The largest villages in the area are   
Waterhouses where our school is        
situated,and Cauldon.                  
                                       
Many of the houses belong  to          
families who have lived in the area for
generations , working the land         
and living amicably with families who  
have come as newcomers to the villages 
to work in the stone quarries or at the
cement works which now dominate the    
landscape.                             
                                       
Agriculture still plays an important   
part, being chiefly concerned with     
milk production and cattle raising.
