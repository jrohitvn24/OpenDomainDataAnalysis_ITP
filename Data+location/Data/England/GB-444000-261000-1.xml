		<title>01NAPTON-ON-THE-HILL</title>
		<content> Napton-on-the-Hill is an attractive   
 village in Warwickshire. The name     
 suggests that it was a Saxon          
 settlement as the word 'ton' is the   
 Saxon word meaning settlement and     
 'knap' means on the top. The hill     
 reaches 500ft and on a clear day 4    
 counties can be seen. A noticeable    
 landmark is a windmill which is now a 
 private residence. Over the years the 
 village was gradually extended until  
 by 1841 the population had reached    
 951. Although it declined during the  
 general depression which hit the      
 agricultural workers in the late      
 1800's it has risen steadily since the
 second world war and is now over      
 1000.There are 3 shops, 3 pubs and an 
 attractive village green. It is a     
 lively, friendly community with many  
 social events in the Church, Village  
 Hall and School.                      </content>
