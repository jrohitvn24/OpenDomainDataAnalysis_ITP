		<content> Our area,{Belle Vue,}is near the town 
 centre and most people use the town's 
 facilities. The cinema, clubs, pubs   
 and in-town entertainment are the most
 popular. Most people go out either    
 once a week{34%,}or twice a week{26%. 
 The majority,{53%}believe that the    
 entertainment is poor,{27%}think its  
 adequate, and only{20%}think it is    
 very good. After work most folk watch 
 T.V., do housework, relax or cook.    
{Shrewsbury Flower Show,}one of the    
 best in the country attracts{46%}of   
 people from our area. The{West Midland
{Show}does not attract as many locals  
 but appeals more to the rural peole of
{Shropshire}being an agricultural show.
 Only{30%}of those surveyed go to      
 disco's. Few people take advantage of 
 the excellent perfoming arts such as  
 plays and top entertertainment        
 provided at{Shrewsbury School.        </content>
