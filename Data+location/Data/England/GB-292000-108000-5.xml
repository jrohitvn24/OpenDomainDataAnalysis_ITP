		<title>05TIVERTON SEWAGE WORKS</title>
		<content> The{sewage works}was rebuilt at       
{Hollywell}in 1968 to cater for 16,000 
 people in{Tiverton and Bolham.        
 Preliminary treatment removes grit and
 grease and macerates paper and rags.  
 The sewage flow goes to 4 primary     
 settlement tanks where sludge is      
 removed and on to 2 biological filter 
 beds. The effluent is distributed by  
 travelling pipes onto a 6 foot deep   
 bed of blast furnace slag. This       
 supports a biological film which      
 purifies by oxidation. The effluent is
 purified by further filtering before  
 being{discharged into the river Exe.  
 The sludge is conditioned by lime and 
 made into agricultural fertiliser.    
 Most of these processes are governed  
 electrically by a central control     
 room. Extensions to the works are     
 planned in the next two years.
