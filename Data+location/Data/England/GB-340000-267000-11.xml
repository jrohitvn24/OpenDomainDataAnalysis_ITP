 Mr Keeley went on to say: "The schools
 have completely changed and we now    
 have two schools to serve the         
 district; a primary and a             
 comprehensive where there was once    
 only one to serve the village.  There 
 is now electricity and mains water.   
 The village has now got only one place
 of worship whereas there were two.    
 The milk used to be delivered by a    
 local farmer who brought it round the 
 village in milk churns instead of     
 bottles.
