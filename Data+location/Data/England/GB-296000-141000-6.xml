		<title>06GRABBIST HILL</title>
		<content> Grabbist Hill runs from Dunster to    
 Wootton Courtenay. On the steep end of
 the hill above Dunster, on the south  
 facing side, ledges have been cut in  
 the hillside where the cloth that used
 to be made, called Dunsters, was put  
 out to dry in the sun. From the top of
 this hill you can see the whole of    
 Dunster and the surrounding           
 countryside. It was here that it is   
 said the well known hymn, "All Things 
 Bright and Beautiful" was composed.   
 A dip in the hill is said to be the   
 armchair of the Giant of Grabbist.    
 According to legend, he was a very    
 kindly Giant, who amongst other things
 when waving his hands caused a breeze 
 that dried the villagers' washing.
