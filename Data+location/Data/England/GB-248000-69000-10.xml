		<title>10LEISURE AND RECREATION</title>
		<content> Every weekend we go out somewhere as a
 family.We walk usually but            
 occasionally we have a pub lunch &amp; do 
 something exciting, like going to the 
 zoo .We get pleasure &amp; exercise out of
 these outings.My dad does "Do it      
 Yourself"  because he gets a good job 
 done how he wants it.Both my parents  
 do some gardening ,partly for pleasure
 &amp; partly to make it look nice.We watch
 television every day. I watch cartoons
 &amp; American police programmes. My mum &amp;
 dad only watch news, nature &amp;         
 gardening.They get hints on things &amp;  
 find out what is going on in the world
 from these.By myself I like to ride my
 bicycle and practice stunts on it.With
 my friends I go to the park &amp; practice
 my football skills.
