		<title>09 Aspal Hall</title>
		<content> There used to be a large moated       
farmhouse called Aspal Hall,surrounded 
by a moat on three sides, the fourth   
side being protected by a very large   
thatched barn. The farm used to employ 
ten people and had 30 horses and 26    
cows. The grounds of Aspal Hall were   
very extensive and are now known as The
Close - an area of uncultivated        
grassland with many old oak trees and  
dried up beds of streams and lakes. It 
was here that we found the dry bed of  
The Beck.                              
 The Hall and fine old barn were       
demolished about 20 years ago, just    
after it was sold, as they had fallen  
into disrepair.   The moat can still be
seen and has been preserved in spite of
the fact that modern houses have been  
built on either side of it and a road  
laid right across the site of the old  
Hall                                   </content>
