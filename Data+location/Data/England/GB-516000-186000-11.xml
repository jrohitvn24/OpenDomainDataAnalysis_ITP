		<title>11SOCIAL CONCERNS-NORTH BRENT</title>
		<content> Generally {North Brent}is pleasant and
 safe but there is a growing problem of
 graffitti on walls and {vandalism} in{
{parks. Assaults} on people both in the
 street and at home for money are      
 increasing.Armed raids on banks and   
 post offices occur every few weeks    
 with the possibility of local shoppers
 being injured. There is a problem of {
{racism} sometimes in North Brent.     
 Jewish people are occasionally        
 threatened or synagogues damaged. One 
 Jewish School in this area has to have
 very stringent {security prescautions}
 to try to prevent the entry of        
 unwanted visitors. There exists much  
 local opposition to the building of a 
 Hindu Temple in Northwick Park mainly 
 because of destruction of open space  
 and increased traffic causing         
 difficulties for the hospital.
