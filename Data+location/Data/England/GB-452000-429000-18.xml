		<title>18GATEFORTH HALL</title>
		<content> The Hall was built in 1812 as a       
 hunting lodge by Sir Humphrey Brooke  
 Osbaldeston.The hall had 2005 acres of
 land around it.It later became a      
 T.B.Hospital which was owned by Leeds 
 Area Health Authority.In 1978 it was  
 bought by auction by Mr.C.Henry and   
 was made back into a hall.Mr.Henry    
 planned to make a hotel and leisure   
 centre but he sold it to Mr.D.Barnett 
 in 1983.The hall has 60 rooms one of  
 which is 10 degrees colder than any   
 other room and yet it has 3 inside    
 walls.This room is where the legendary
 Grey Lady slept who is the ghost of   
 the hall.Gateforth hall is now a      
 restaurant and Mr.Barnett is hoping to
 make it into a hotel which will cost  
 around 1/4 million pounds.
