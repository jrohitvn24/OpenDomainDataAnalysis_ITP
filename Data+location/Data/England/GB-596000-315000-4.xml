		<title>04A DAY IN THE LIFE OF FIONA</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.30 in the morning and go
 downstairs to have breakfast. I have  
 2.5 Weetabix in a bowl with some      
 milk.When I have finished that I have 
 4 pieces of buttered toast and a cup  
 of tea.Then I go and put on my        
 clothes. I wear a blue and white      
 gingham dress. Then I wash my face and
 clean my teeth in the bathroom. I say 
 goodbye to Mum and walk off up the    
 road to school. It takes 3            
 minutes.When I get there I rush to    
 meet Georgina and Clare. We play games
 like Sticking Glue. The teacher blows 
 the whistle at 9.00.We quickly get in 
 lines and see our teacher standing    
 there. She says go in class 6 and 28  
 children walk into school.Class 5 off 
 you go.Nicky come out at the front and
 stop talking, you can write out 50    
 lines at dinner time.Class 4 go       
 in,3,2,and class 1.   By Fiona aged 9.</content>
