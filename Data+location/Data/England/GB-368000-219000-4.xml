		<content> Our school is Longhope C.ofE.         
 (controlled) Primary School. It has,  
 in 1985,65 children aged 4-11 years   
 arranged in three classes.It was      
 originally built as a National School 
 in 1829 and the buildings lie within  
 the Rectory grounds.The canteen       
 building was a converted stable. When 
 the village population grew in the    
 '70's two terrapin classrooms were    
 built at the edge of the playground.  
 Following the death of the Rector in  
 1982 the Rectory was sold and the     
 orchard behind the school was altered 
 to provide us with a playing field. At
 11 years of age all children will     
 transfer to a new 11-16 Comprehensive 
 School at Mitcheldean called Dene     
 Magna,opening in September 1985 on the
 premises of the Abenhall Secondary    
 Modern School.
