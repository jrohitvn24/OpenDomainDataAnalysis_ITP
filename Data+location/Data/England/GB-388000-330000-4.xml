		<title>04PIREHILL</title>
		<content>  The name dates from Saxon times. The 
hill was a meeting place for the       
hundred moot and the point where people
rallied if they were attacked. Beacons 
were lit here in times of danger. Stone
is still part of the Pirehill Hundred  
today.                                 
  Because of its name, Pirehill House  
was a good place to choose for the     
County Fire Brigade H.Q. Built in the  
1940's it is the control centre of 30  
fire stations and 1000 people. It has  
charge of money, transport, fire       
investigation and prevention etc. Sixty
people work here. The County Chief Fire
Officer is based at Pirehill House.
