		<title>01Windermere area - general</title>
		<content> The survey area, which is part of the 
 Lake District National Park, is on the
 southern fringe of the upland mass of 
 the Lakeland fells. The western edge  
 of the area is part of Windermere     
 lake, which is over 10 miles long.    
 Population is concentrated in the     
 western part of the block, the main   
 settlement being the large village of 
 Windermere itself.                    
  Farming is the most stable industry  
 and the longest established,          
 concentrating on sheep and cattle. The
 marvellous scenery of fells and lakes 
 attracts large numbers of visitors    
 from all parts of the world. The      
 summer population explosion brings    
 financial benefits and jobs but       
 various problems as well.
