		<content> The majority of people who live in    
 Repton or Newton Solney travel to     
 Burton to{shop}because it is the      
 nearest major town.                   
 The majority of the villagers are     
{retired}and so the occupations are    
 gardening, reading, completing        
 cross-words puzzles, sewing and       
 cooking.                              
 Not many people{dine}in Hotels or     
 restaurants,this pleasure is reserved 
 for special occasions . However local 
 people still go out to Pubs to        
 socialise.                            
 Most people bought their{clothes}     
 saying that they did not have time to 
 make them.                            
 Most people listened to{'classical    
{music'}and only occasionally 'pop'.   
{Gambling}proved to be a rare pursuit  
 although about half put money of the  
 Football Pools.                       </content>
