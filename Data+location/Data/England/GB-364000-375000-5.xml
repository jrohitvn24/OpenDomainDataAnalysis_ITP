		<title>05VILLAGE POSTMASTER, CHESHIRE</title>
		<content> The Postmaster who owns a General     
 Store in Comberbach, Cheshire leads a 
 very interesting life. He struggles   
 out of bed at 6.00 a.m. and opens the 
 shop at 7.30. He always looks forward 
 to meeting new people. A stranger     
 comes in and asks for some information
 about the area. He gives it smilingly,
 for the shop is the mini-information  
 centre of village life. He hears a    
 tooting horn: his grocery order has   
 arrived. As he collects it, he thinks 
 how this is his favourite job of the  
 day, but he hates mopping the floor!  
 The only local produce he sells is    
 mainly potatoes and vegetables, but   
 he actually stocks most things you can
 think of. He closes for lunch between 
 one and two. Being the postmaster, he 
 thinks he provides a vital local      
 service, especially to the old-age    
 pensioners who consider him a friend. </content>
