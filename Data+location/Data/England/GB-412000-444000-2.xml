		<title>02HOUSING AT BURLEY WOODHEAD</title>
		<content>   Our job in the Domesday project was 
 to study the houses in{Burley Woodhead
 We discovered that most of the houses 
 were at least 100 years old and were  
 at one time mills, warehouses, mill   
 workers' cottages etc. They are all   
 with only one or two exceptions,made  
 of stone with stone slab roofs.       
 Most of the windows and doors have    
 been replaced but even so,each house  
 has its own personal,characteristic   
 features. Some of the buildings have  
 either been rebuilt,using the original
 stone or converted into family homes  
 but this has been done in such a way  
 that none of the houses and cottages  
 look out of place in the beautiful,   
 countryside surroundings.             
   All in all,Burley Woodhead is a very
 pleasant place to live.
