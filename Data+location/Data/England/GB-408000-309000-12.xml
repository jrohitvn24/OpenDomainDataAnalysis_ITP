		<title>12 Sheriff's Ride</title>
		<content>On the Saturday nearest 8th September, 
the Sheriff and his officials, along   
with about 200 other riders, set off   
on a 16 mile trek. This is to take     
them around the ancient boundary of    
Lichfield.                             
  This ceremony was started in the     
year 1664, when a charter was issued   
to let Lichfield elect a Mayor and a   
Sheriff. The charter then went on to   
say that the Sheriff should, on the    
8th September, ride round the          
boundary. They were to stop at certain 
stations,  where they were given       
specific drinks   which included       
ginger wine in milk, port, sherry and  
a few others. Unfortunately for the    
riders they are only given sherry.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
