 Louise(11) and Tim(9) go to the Church
 Choir practise at East Hoathly or     
 Chiddingly. Mum tidies the house and  
 puts Rowan(2) to bed then she gardens 
 or irons before shutting the ducks in.
 Dad goes back to his workshop or      
 visits the local pub.                 
 On Saturday the children play or mow  
 the lawn. Dad works and Mum makes     
 lunch for 1.0p.m. The afternoon is    
 spent either shopping in a local town,
 at a fete or gardening or visiting    
 friends. After a high tea at 6.00p.m. 
 the family spend the evening at home. 
 Sunday morning after a cooked         
 breakfast the children go to church.  
 Dad does his paperwork and Mum cooks  
 the roast dinner. In the afternoon    
 they visit grandparents or go sailing 
 in their dinghy or into their wood to 
 cook supper over an open fire.        </content>
