		<content> The Fact that this{Spire- Symbol of   
{Hope}still stands after more than 600 
 years testifies to the faith and skill
 of the builders. It testifies also to 
 the faith and generosity of previous  
 generations who gave money for        
 repairs.  Please Support Our Appeal   
 Generously. We can then secure this   
{unique treasure of our English        
{Heritage}for generations to come and  
 our Cathedral will continue to be a   
 gathering place for all kinds of      
 people,{a work of art with power to   
{make a difference to people's lives.
