		<title>18MY HOUSE 2</title>
		<content>  My house is special to me because it 
 has a small but beautiful garden. I   
 have my own little stone pot of sweet 
 peas and they are just about to       
 flower. I also have a little stone    
 hedgehog beside my sweet peas. My     
 brother has a little pond for his     
 tadpoles. It has a stone frog on a    
 stand and our cat, Magnus, drinks all 
 the water. We also have a proper pond.
 Our garden slopes. We have a frog that
 squirts water from its mouth and he is
 standing under a bridge which is also 
 made of stone. Then we have a stone   
 cat. It is sitting by the pond looking
 as if it is about to have a drink. I  
 love my garden and I don't want it to 
 change. My house is not as nice as the
 garden but I don't really mind as I   
 can live in it in comfort.
