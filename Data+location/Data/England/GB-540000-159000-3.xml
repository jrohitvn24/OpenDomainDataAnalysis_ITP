       The airport was built in 1917   
 and during the Second World War is was
 a famous fighter station in the Battle
 of Britain.  The airport is about 170 
 metres above sea level and it         
 overlooks London.  The London Borough 
 of Bromley now owns the airport, which
 is open for approximately 4,000 hours 
 per year with an aeroplane landing or 
 taking off every 1.75 minutes.  The   
 main runway is 1,837 metres long and  
 the largest plane to have used the    
 airport is a Boeing 747.              
       Based at the airport are ten    
 flying clubs and flying for recreation
 is important, especially at weekends. 
 A number of commercial business       
 organisations have planes based at the
 airfield and these are used for       
 executive and freight transport.      </content>
