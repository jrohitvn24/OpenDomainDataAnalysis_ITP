		<title>15The Nine Stones</title>
		<content> The Nine Stones are quite famous. They
 are made of flint  and stone. The     
 tallest was two metres high.The       
 smallest stone was covered by the     
 roots of a tree. They are nine stones 
 formed in a circle. Local superstition
 believes they have supernatural       
 powers.Only a couple of years ago on  
 different foggy evenings two cars were
 supposed to have been stopped by      
 them.They have been there since 1500  
 B.C.and were probably a British       
 temple.                               
 Half a mile West of the temple in the 
 road is a large flat stone perhaps the
 remains of a cromleck.
