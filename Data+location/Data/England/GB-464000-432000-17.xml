		<title>17Houses in Cliffe</title>
		<content>      Nearly all the houses in the area
 are privately owned. There were 22    
{Council houses}in Cliffe, 10 in       
 Chapelfields on York Road, and 12 in  
 Curson Terrace along Oxen Lane, but   
 some people have bought their houses  
 from the Council.                     
      There are six council houses in  
 South Duffield, and none in the part  
 of Osgodby covered by the survey.     
      Houses are built of brick, some  
 modern ones have stone for ornament.  
 Roofs are tiles or slates. Almost all 
 the{private houses}are detatched, in  
 Osgodby there are a lot of bungalows. 
 There are hardly any old houses, and  
 the ones that are left have been      
 modernised.                           
      All the houses have gardens and  
 most have garages. Nearly all have    
 central heating, worked from coal or  
 oil because there is no gas.          </content>
