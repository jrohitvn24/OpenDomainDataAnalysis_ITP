{Sunniside, like Tow Law a mile to the 
{west, is a former pit-village.}At one 
 time many people lived here. Today    
 however, houses have been pulled down 
 and there are now large gaps where    
 once rows of terraced houses stood.   
                                       
 There are few amenities here as       
 shopping is carried out in Tow Law or 
 in Crook (3 miles).                   
                                       
 Behind one of the pubs on the main    
 road through the village there is a   
 disused{miner's handball court.}A huge
 self-supported wall, there are vague  
 plans to bring it back into use.      
                                       
 The houses on the southern edge have  
 extensive views over the valley of the
 River Wear.                           
                                       </content>
