         HMS Victory                   
      It is worthwhile paying a visit  
 to Portsmouth Dockyard to see the     
 oldest serving warship in the world,  
 HMS Victory, built in 1765.{          
 You may have to queue for a           
 little while but you don't have to pay
 amd a guide will show you around. The 
 hour long tour first takes you to     
 where Nelson slept in a kind of cot   
 which could also be used as a coffin! 
 Then you will go to the Admiral's     
 cabin which is where Nelson ate and   
 planned battles such as the famous    
 Battle of Trafalgar of 1805. On the   
 top deck there is a plaque showing    
 where Nelson was shot. There are also 
 four lifeboats here for the crew of   
 850. You can see where Nelson died and
 the mess deck where the crew ate,     
 slept and worked. It's so interesting.</content>
