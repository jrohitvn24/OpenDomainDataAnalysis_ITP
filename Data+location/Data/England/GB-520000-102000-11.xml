		<content> local people think the buses are in a 
 bad state. This is because of ripped  
 seats and dirty floors.               
    The survey also showed that 56% of 
 the interviewed people that bus routes
 should be extended and more bus stops 
 put in the suburban areas. The other  
 44% think the bus route is either good
 or too long. The majority of the      
 residents thought that the fares were 
 too expensive with only 6% thinking   
 they were good value for money.       
    We analysed the people who said the
 fares weren't good value for money and
 found that teenagers between 14/15    
 years of age thought that full fare on
 the buses should be at 16 instead     
 of 14. This group also included old   
 age pensioners who thought that they  
 were too high because they live on a  
 state pension and in many cases can't 
 walk very far.                        </content>
