		<title>18THE GROUNDWORK TRUST.</title>
		<content>     In recent years a number of really
 imaginative  projects in redevelopment
 have begun in our  area, organised  by
 the  ' Groundwork  Trust'.  This   was
 established in St.Helens and  Knowsley
 in  1982  to  carry  out  work  on the
 natural   experiment   :-   "Operation
 Groundwork", introduced in 1980. Since
 then  four  other  areas in North West
 England   have   been   added  to  the
 original   pilot   area,  all   chosen
 because   of   their   problems   of  
 dereliction. The  experiment  aims  to
 improve  and  make  better  use of the
 landscape   around  major   industrial
 centres   and   hopes  to  provide  a 
 blue-print for  other European Cities.
 At present  it is government funded by
 the  Countryside  Commission  and  the
 relevant Local Councils, but the Trust
 aims  to  be self sufficient in time.
