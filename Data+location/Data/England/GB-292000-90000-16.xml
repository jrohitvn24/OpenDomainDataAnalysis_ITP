		<title>16VANDALISM TODAY BY JOANNE</title>
		<content>  Behind my house there is a school for
 partially-sighted children.The care-  
 taker gives us permission to play     
 there.But a few months ago there were 
 some teen-agers who broke the goal    
 posts and they turned the small       
 climbing frame over and we weren't    
 allowed there anymore.Also where I    
 live there is a park with rubber      
 swings and one night somebody cut all 
 the swings in half.Since then we've   
 had three or four different sets of   
 swings.About one month ago some       
 teenagers came up and they all got on 
 the round-about and the screw came    
 loose and ehen you got on,it went     
 lop-sided and the person who was      
 lighter would go up.That happened a   
 few times then they took the round-   
 about away.It was gone for at least   
 three weeks and they put it back.     
 Since then we have had no vandalism.  </content>
