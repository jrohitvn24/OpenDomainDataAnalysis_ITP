		<content> Since the closure of the Kingsbridge  
 to South Brent railway branch line    
 the only public transport available in
 the area is the bus.                  
 The only settlement still to be served
 by Western National buses is The      
 Mounts - situated on the only main    
 road. Apart from school buses there is
 a service to Kingsbridge and Totnes   
 each day, and extra services on       
 Tuesdays and Fridays.                 
 Woodleigh, once less than a mile to   
 the railway station, has no longer    
 even a bus service, apart from an     
 early morning school bus.             
 Loddiswell is served by the same      
 school bus, but also has services to  
 Kingsbridge each day and a service to 
 Plymouth on Fridays. These routes are 
 operated by the Kingsbridge based     
 Tally Ho! bus company. It is quite    
 obvious why owning a car is essential!</content>
