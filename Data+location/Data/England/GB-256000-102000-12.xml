		<title>12Food in Woodhalls</title>
		<content> The traditional foods of the area have
 evolved over the centuries in a rural 
 environment which used to be extremely
 isolated.The women had to provide     
 substantial meals from what was       
 readily available for their hard-     
 working menfolk.                      
     Cattle,sheep and pigs provided    
 meat,milk,cream,butter and cheese.    
 Cereals, vegetables, fruit,herbs and  
 flavourings were grown in the fields  
 and hedgerows.                        
     Some ingredients such as saffron  
 for saffron cakes is no longer grown  
 but many traditional dishes are still 
 made.Pasties are baked with a wide    
 variety of sweet and savoury fillings.
 Where dairy cows are kept clotted     
 cream is made, and hogs pudding and   
 other savoury offal dishes are made   
 when a pig is killed. (Recipes p13)
