		<title>04DENWICK VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{Denwick }is a small village belonging 
 entirely to {The Northumberland       
{Estates. }The shape of the village has
 remained unchanged since the earliest 
 existing records and every effort is  
 made to maintain its character. Any   
 alterations must blend with existing  
 buildings and any extensions must be  
 to the rear of the properties.{       
{Tenants,}who have all worked for the  
 Duke at sometime,are not allowed to   
 buy or alter their houses so there    
 will always be control over the       
 appearance of the village.{The Duke of
{Northumberland }regards the village as
 part of a family,rents are low and the
 Estate is responsible for all repairs 
 which can be reported at the{3 monthly
{rent days }if they are not urgent.    
 Tenants are not allowed to accommodate
 tourists but don't mind this          
 restriction.                          </content>
