		<title>17A Lundy childhood remembered</title>
		<content> Idyllic,blissful,carefree;this was the
 life of a child on Lundy in private   
 ownership days,as described by a      
 resident whose family has been        
 connected with Lundy for sixty two    
 years.                                
 "Goatey" her pet goat was her sole    
 companion as for most of her girlhood 
 she was the only child on the island. 
 She was left to her own devices for   
 much of the time,so of necessity a    
 deep respect for the cliffs and sea   
 were instilled in her from an early   
 age.She would wander freely through   
 the fields and while away hours in the
 quarries where she would imagine fairy
 folk flitting past the towering       
 granite.Adult residents spoit her.    
 There was always time to spare for a  
 child in this timeless society.She was
 allowed to ride on one of the four    
 huge working cart horses. {(Continued)</content>
