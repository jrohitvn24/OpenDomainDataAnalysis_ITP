		<title>12A Solihull Doctor's Surgery</title>
		<content> We paid a visit to a local{doctor's   
{surgery.}In it there were five        
 doctors, five receptionists, a        
 secretary, a cleaner and a manager.   
 Their youngest patient was a new-born 
 baby and their oldest was  100 years  
 old.                                  
 The doctors prescribe drugs and       
 medicines to make people better. If   
 they don't know what is wrong with    
 people they refer them to specialists 
 at the{hospital.}                     
 We were told that more women than men 
 visit the doctor; more old people     
 than young people; more babies than   
 children. The busiest day was Monday  
 and the quietest day was Wednesday.   
 Coughs and colds were the most common 
 complaint.                            
 Many leaflets were                    
 available at the surgery telling      
 people how they could stay healthy.   </content>
