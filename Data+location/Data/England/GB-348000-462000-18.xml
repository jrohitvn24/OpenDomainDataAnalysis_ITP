		<title>18MUSLIM BELIEFS</title>
		<content>The two Muslim sects believe that there
is only one God and that Mohammed was  
his last prophet. The difference is    
that the Sunnies believe that Mohammed 
is not human and the Tabliqs believe   
that he was. The Tabliqs accept a      
preaching group called Jamaats. These  
men are ordinary people who travel from
town to town preaching in the Mosque.  
when present the Jamaat stays, sleeping
and eating in the Mosque. The Sunnies  
do not agree with this. The Tabliqs    
believe that, as the Prophet Mohammed  
preached, everybody should preach. The 
Sunnies reserve the act of Preaching to
'saints'who have special religious     
power and are not ordinary people. The 
Tabliqs do not believe that there are  
saints alive today. Both sects believe 
that only God can perform miracles and 
that all miracles had been performed by
the end of Mohammed's life on earth.   </content>
