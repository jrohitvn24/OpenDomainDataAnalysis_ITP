		<title>13New Industry - YKK</title>
		<content> As well as Bass (see page 12) coming  
 to the area,{YKK}have built a factory.
 YKK is a{Japanese}company making{zips.
                                       
 The factory is run on{'Japanese       
{lines'.} As this was one of the first 
 factories in Britain to be run on     
 these lines it received a lot of      
 publicity when it opened.             
                                       
 Among the Japanese 'innovations' at   
 the factory is the one canteen for    
 workers and management alike.         
                                       
 One of the incentives for the workers 
 is a{trip to Japan. }A list of        
 efficient workers is made by the      
 management. The workers themselves    
 then vote on who deserves to be given 
 such a trip                           
                                       
                                       </content>
