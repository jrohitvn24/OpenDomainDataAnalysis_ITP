farmers and take them to shops in      
Whitstable,Herne Bay and Folkestone.   
 An old railway track runs across the  
farm,it ran from Woodnesborough to Ash.
 We walked along the track to Poulton  
Farm and looked at the fields with     
Mrs.Smith.                             
 They have some special machinery on

the stalks.There is a cold store for   
the salad vegetables.Potatoes &amp; onions 
are stored in a large ventilated shed  </content>
