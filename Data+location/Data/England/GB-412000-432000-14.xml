		<content> On close inspection of our area it    
 became evident that much facility is  
 made for people with{special needs.}  
 These include a large National Health 
 hospital with excellent casualty      
 coverage, a maternity unit annexe, an 
 ear, eye, nose and throat unit and a  
 centre where cancer cure is           
 researched. Another aspect of caring  
 for people with special needs is the  
 centre for{mentally handicapped}people
 called Ardwyn House. This is a private
 organisation for people over 12 years 
 of age. All help is voluntary and its 
 upkeep depends on public support. The 
 youth of this area who demand special 
 attention are catered for in various  
 ways. Children from a broken home may 
 attend Springfield Children's Home.   
 They may stay 5 years.
