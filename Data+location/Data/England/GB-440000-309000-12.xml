		<title>12IBSTOCK COMMUNITY COLLEGE -2</title>
		<content>   The college has specialised in      
 helping the physically disabled people
 of the area. There is a daytime       
 workshop, weekly social and swimming  
 clubs. They are beginning a major new 
 project to help the unemployed.       
   Staff hope to extend people's       
 horizons and improve their quality of 
 life by encouraging various pursuits  
 (e.g. youth hostelling).              
   They run a welfare rights bureau    
 fortnightly at which people may       
 discuss in private any social problems
 they may have.                        
   College staff see themselves as an  
 agency for serving the community's    
 needs as and when they arise.         
   Dealing with people was considered  
 the best and worst aspect of the job  
 of Community Tutor.
