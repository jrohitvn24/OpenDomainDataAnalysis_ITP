		<content>  At Blackbrook Farm Mr. Busbridge     
 showed us some badger sets and there  
 are 2 Barn Owls nesting in the barn.  
 He keeps 1240 sheep, these are mainly 
 Romneys and some Dorsets.  He has a   
 beef herd of 68 Hereford and Charolais
 cattle and his sheep provide meat and 
 wool.  The average size of the fields 
 is 8 acres and their cultivation has  
 not changed since 1670.               
                                       
  Mr. Busbridge has 6 Jacob's Sheep.   
 Mrs. Busbridge uses their wool for    
 spinning.  First of all she brushes   
 the wool with something called cards  
 which are like flat wire brushes;     
 these are made of leather backed onto 
 wood through which the wires are      
 pushed.  You brush the wool until fine
 then you spin it into strands.
