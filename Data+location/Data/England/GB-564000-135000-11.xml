		<title>11Fruit Farming in Lamberhurst</title>
		<content>   Lamberhurst is in the{Weald of Kent 
 which is often called{The Garden of   
{England.                              
   Many of the farms in this area      
 specialise in{fruit.}Copthall Farm's  
 29 acres are made up of 8 acres of    
 strawberries, 5 acres of woodland, 2  
 acres of each of runner beans and     
 raspberries, with the remainder lying 
 fallow. 2 full time workers are       
 employed, with 20 more at picking     
 time.                                 
   Most farms have{apple}orchards. The 
 large well-spaced trees that need     
 ladders to reach their tops at pruning
 and harvest times are being replaced  
 by rows of small trees on dwarfing    
 stock. Many more trees are planted    
 per acre and trained by tying on to   
 wires. The number of{cherry}trees is  
 dwindling, but{pears}are becoming more
 widely grown.                         </content>
