		<content> LOCAL HISTORY:Looe is known to be a   
 very ancient port and was probably a  
 trading port by the name of Shute at  
 the time of the birth of Christ.The   
 name Looe translated into Gallic means
 Pool and could refer to the confluence
 of the East &amp; West Looe rivers above  
 the town forming a pool.The ancient   
 derelict chapel of Lammana can be     
 found together with one wall of the   
 Monk's house in the fields at         
 Hannafore.The 14th Century bridge     
 spanning the river was unusual in that
 it had a Chapel in the middle.It was  
 demolished in the 19th Century when   
 the present bridge was built.Looe is  
 said to have supplied more ships and  
 men per population than any other town
 on the south coast against the Armada.
