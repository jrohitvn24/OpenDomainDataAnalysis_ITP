 swans from Europe,sparrow hawks,

 butterflies,badgers,hedgehogs,foxes,

 The RAF are the most frequent         
 visitors .Our survey showed that about
 50% of people noticed the planes and  
 didn't mind ,40% hadn't noticed them  
 and 10% didn't like the noise and how 
 low they flew.People liked seeing the 
 RAF flying over, knew that practice   
 somewhere was necessary and felt safer
 with the knowledge that the RAF are   
 protecting them. In 1982, at the time 
 of the Falklands dispute, aerial      
 activity increased.                   </content>
