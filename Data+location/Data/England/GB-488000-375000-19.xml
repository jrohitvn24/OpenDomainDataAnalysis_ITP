		<title>19Ecology of Saxilby Area</title>
		<content> Modern  machinery  can  transform  the
 landscape overnight!  In  Saxilby  and
 Broxholme  work  has  commenced on the
 Lincoln Flood Alleviation Scheme. In a
 special ceremony on October 15th  1985
 the  Mayor  of  Lincoln  cut the first
 turf in Saxilby.  Site  buildings  and
 excavators had already arrived in many
 fields.   2.98  square  kilometres  of
 washland will be created by the  River
 Till,   comprising   a  shallow  earth
 embankment  across  the  river  valley
 with  a sluice on the river to control
 the flow of water passing  downstream.
 The majority of the time the washlands
 will  be  farmed normally. Decision to
 use the  washlands  would  be  at  the
 Water  Authority's  discretion,  maybe
 only once in 100 years. It will be the
 largest scheme  of  its  kind  in  the
 country.                              
                                       </content>
