		<title>13AN INTERVIEW WITH A RESIDENT</title>
		<content>    Mrs. Jackson is the village primary
 school secretary.She has lived in the 
 village all of her life.              
    There have been many changes in the
 village since she was a little        
 girl.The village has grown and there  
 are new private houses as well as a   
 council estate.                       
    The building of the new by_pass    
 road in 1984 has meant the loss of    
 trade in the local shops and garages. 
 In fact Mrs. Jackson has seen many    
 shops in the village shut down as she 
 has grown up,people preferring to go  
 to the larger shops and supermarkets  
 in the nearby towns of Wisbech and    
 King's Lynn.                          
    Mrs. Jackson spent her time as a   
 young girl listening to the radio,    
 playing sport connected with school,  
 being involved with Sunday School     
 activities and having typing lessons. </content>
