		<content> MONNINGTON COURT AND CHURCH           
 The court and church stand in a lovely
 position on the banks of the Wye, near
 the ancient Walk, one of the oldest   
 tree lined avenues in the country. The
 small church, rebuilt by Uvedale      
 Tomkyns in 1679 and regularly used for
 services, is still lit only by oil    
 lamps. The Court dating from the 13th 
 century is the home of film maker John
 Bulmer and his wife Angela Connner the
 Sculptor whose works can be seen in a 
 sculpture garden specially created for
 them. Also at the Court is the        
 Foundation Farm of the Morgan Horse of
 GB. The work of training and breeding 
 can be seen by visitors and there are 
 special displays of the Morgans at    
 various times of the year.
