		<title>12THE RIVER SOWE</title>
		<content> The River Sowe flows from the North of
 Coventry around the Eastern side and  
 then flows South through Warwickshire 
 down to Stoneleigh.                   
 It is a lovely sight to see in some   
 parts but in others pollution and     
 destruction occur with the oil spilled
 pools,with rubbish and crisp papers   
 drifting downstream to nicer          
 parts,destroying beauty.Oil traces    
 leave a trail of pollution and death  
 to animals which have survived a long 
 time.But people do not care,they      
 murder not one or two but thousands   
 every year.                           
 Also looking at the pleasanter side of
 the river,the odd thrush or           
 kingfisher,robin or blackbird can be  
 seen.The predator waits for its prey  
 peacefully swimming by,then splash    
 another death.That is Nature,pollution
 is not.                               </content>
