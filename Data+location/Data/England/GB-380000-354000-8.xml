		<title>08POLICE IN ALSAGER</title>
		<content>  Two policeman work at a time in      
 Alsager together with a Panda car and 
 a Traffic car. The crime rate in      
 Alsager is below the national average 
 and the most common crime is burglary.
 Of course if there is a crime someone 
 must write the reports which must     
 contain all the facts of the incident.
  Policing is easier now as the police 
 now use computers which can flash a   
 message from one end of the country to
 the other. The police station in      
 Alsager is small and over seventy     
 years old. The conditions there are   
 very good. The police in Alsager are  
 controlled by the police station in   
 Congleton which also controls Holmes  
 Chapel, Sandbach, etc. The vehicles   
 are liked by the policemen and are    
 changed every three years. The panda  
 cars in Alsager are Chevettes and the 
 traffic cars are Rovers. By R.Kehoe.  </content>
