		<content> Most families in the area appear to be
 fairly similar in size.There is       
 usually four members.Here is an       
 example of  a child's view of the     
 family."There are four in my family   
 .There is my mum who stays at home.She
 does quite often come up and help in  
 the commmunity centre with the        
 preschool.My dad works at home most of
 the time.He works with computers.He   
 sometimes has to go to lots of        
 different countries.My brother is     
 still at school.He goes to the high   
 school.He's the clever one in the     
 family.He's always getting things     
 right and gets loads of merit marks   
 for his homework.He's mad about       
 computers.He's got four.I'm the baby  
 of the family.I'm quite clever but not
 that much.My dad's very quiet but my  
 mum does alot of the shouting.I like  
 my family."                           </content>
