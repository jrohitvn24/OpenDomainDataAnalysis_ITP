		<content>{Our block lies in The Forest of Dean  
{and shows a typical cross section of  
{the type of area we live in.The main  
{population centres of Cinderford and  
{Littledean are surrounded by forest   
{which is carefully managed by The     
{Forestry Commission.                  
 Cinderford the largest settlement in  
 the block is a town which grew in a   
 hurry when mining in the area         
 blossomed during the Industrial       
 Revolution. At the moment the urban   
 area is a scene of part dereliction   
 where the mining an associated        
 industries have died and part         
 expansion where new industry is       
 springing up.{In our text we describe 
{our history, opinions, things we do in
{our spare time, visits to our Friday  
{market and police station and many    
{other thing which figure in our every 
{day lives.                            </content>
