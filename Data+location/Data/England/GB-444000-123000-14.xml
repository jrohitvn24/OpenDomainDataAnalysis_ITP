  The church porch is victorian.Above  
 the door is a beutifully carved arch. 
 This door is large,firm and has iron  
 studs on it.                          
     In 1905 so many people used the   
 church that they decided to add an    
 extension.Some large pillars mark     
 where the south wall of the old church
 used to be.In the western part of the 
 old church is a font.Next to the font 
 are three new bell ropes they were    
 installed by Charles Cope.The bells   
 are rung by two boys from Compton     </content>
