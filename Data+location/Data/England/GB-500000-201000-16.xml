		<title>16THE MUSKETT DUO (continued)</title>
		<content>      Michael and Doreen Muskett       
 started collecting instruments in     
 1970. Their collection now contains   
 about 300 items. Many of their        
 instruments are wind instruments, but 
 they also specialise in the           
 Hurdy-Gurdy and they also teach people
 to play this unusual instrument.      
      In their concerts they try to    
 make the sounds as they would have    
 been at the time when the music was   
 written. They also have a harpsichord 
 as this is a much older instrument    
 than the piano.                       
      They perform concerts all over   
 Britain. They particularly enjoy      
 working with children, but they       
 perform regularly at the London South 
 Bank Festival and have performed on   
 radio and television. They have also  
 undertaken tours of France, Germany   
 and the U.S.A.                        </content>
