		<content>{THE SCHOOL__}The school was founded in
 1832 by Francis Walker, gentleman. He 
 collected subscriptions from local    
 people and gave the land for the      
 building of a school and school house.
 The actual cost of the building was   
 Â£15 14s.10d. In 1871 a porch was      
 added and another classroom was built 
 on in 1891. The school house is now a 
 private home.                         
  In July 1985 the school closed and   
 plans for the future of the building  
 are under discussion. The pupils will 
 attend the County Primary School      
 in Leyburn from September 1985.       
  An exhibition to mark the closure of 
 the school was held on July 6th.__See
