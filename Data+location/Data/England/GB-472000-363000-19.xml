		<title>19CLUBS AROUND OSSINGTON (2).</title>
		<content>    The building in Ossington which is 
 used as a meeting place is referred to
 as the{'Hut'.}It is made up of two    
 First World War army barrack huts,    
 which were originally sited at        
 Clipstone. At the end of the war, they
 were dismantled and re-erected in     
 Ossington to make one building to be  
 used by the villagers. Social         
 functions such as the annual{Harvest  
{Supper}and{Christmas Social}take place
 there together with the occasional    
 supper dance and any{public meetings  
 concerning the village.               
    For membership of other clubs it is
 necessary to travel to the            
 neighbouring villages where can be    
 found the Womens' Institute, youth    
 clubs, young farmers' clubs, cubs,    
 scouts and brownies, gardening club   
 and local history societies.
