		<title>06A DAY IN MY LIFE, BARNSTAPLE</title>
		<content> I woke up in the morning and felt ill 
 so I didn't go to school. I dozed most
 of the day.I had dinner at 12 o'clock 
 then did a puzzle.When my sister      
 returned from school I went to see my 
 gran and grandad.I stayed for a while 
 then came home and went to sleep.     
                                       
 May 11th 1985 was quite an easy day   
 for me.My son who was unwell stayed   
 home from school.After my daughter    
 went to school I washed the dishes,   
 made the beds and took the dog for a  
 walk .My son and I had lunch and then 
 he did a jigsaw puzzle .We had our    
 evening meal and then went to see my  
 parents.The children went to bed at   
 nine. I watched television and went to
 bed around eleven.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
