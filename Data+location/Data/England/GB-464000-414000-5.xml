		<content> WE OFTEN SEE MR SMITH DRIVING AROUND  
 THE VILLAGE LANES IN HIS PONY AND     
 TRAP.I VISITED HIM AND ASKED HIM A FEW
 QUESTIONS.I SAID "WHY DO I SEE YOU    
 OFTEN IN THE PONY AND TRAP"? "BECAUSE 
 I CRASHED MY SONS CAR AND HE WOULDN'T 
 LET ME DRIVE IT AGAIN. YOU SEE IN THE 
 OLDEN DAYS THERE WEREN'T MOTOR BIKES  
 AND CARS. ALL WE HAD WERE HORSES AND  
 CARTS AND PONIES AND TRAPS. THEY DROVE
 AROUND EASILY AND WE HAD FRESH AIR SO 
 THATS WHY I HAVE ONE. I LIKE TO GO    
 SLOWLY AND HAVE FRESH AIR". "HAVE YOU 
 A PONY FOR IT"? I ASKED." NO BUT I'LL 
 HAVE ONE SOON" HE SAID. "I GO ALONG   
 ROADS AS WELL AS THE LANES. WHEN  I   
 COME PAST YOUR HOUSE I WILL COME      
 EARLY AND YOU CAN HAVE A RIDE ROUND   
 SYKEHOUSE AND DOWN THE COUNTRY LANES  
 WITH ME."
