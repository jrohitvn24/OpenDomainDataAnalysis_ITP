		<title>16LOCAL HISTORY  Clipston 1900</title>
		<content>  Mr. Wilford a local character, was   
able to give us a very clear idea about
what life was like at the turn of the  
century.                               
  Every one in the village knew        
everyone else.  There was virtually no 
transport out, only the horse and cart 
for the richer members of the          
community.  The majority of the people 
were born, lived their childhood,      
married a local person, raised their   
own family and died all within the     
village itself.                        
  At this time Clipston had its own    
railway station but it was two miles   
from the village and too expensive to  
use on a regular basis.  The local     
taxi was a pony and trap, the only     
other alternatives to these methods of 
transport was either walking, cycling  
or getting a lift on the Brewers Dray.
