		<content>    We asked every pupil in our school 
 where he or she was going on holiday  
 this year.                            
    To our surprise most people said   
 they were staying at home in          
 Hellifield. Other popular holiday     
 resorts were S.Wales, Scarborough,    
 Bridlington and Cornwall.             
    When we asked children where their 
 families liked to go for a day out,   
 the favourite places were Blackpool   
 and Morecambe.                        
    Our favourite activities on holiday
 include playing on the beach,         
 collecting shells, swimming in the sea
 and watching sea-birds. Fishing is    
 another thing we like to do and       
 sailing in boats. Night -time         
 activities we enjoy are walks,        
 disco-dancing, flying kites and visits
 to the amusement arcades.
