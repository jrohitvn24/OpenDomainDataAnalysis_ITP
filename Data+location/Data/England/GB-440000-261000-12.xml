		<title>12Shopping in the Southam Area</title>
		<content>  Most needs and services are catered  
 for in the Southam area. Shops range  
 from small village stores to large    
 supermarkets ( a new supermarket is   
 under construction at the moment). In 
 spite of the fact that so much is     
 available in Southam itself, most     
 families enjoy a shopping trip to     
 Leamington Spa, Coventry, Rugby or    
 Banbury once a week, combining        
 shopping with an enjoyable outing.    
  There is a small open air{market}on  
 Tuesdays with a free bus service to   
 bring in people from surrounding      
 villages. Here all sorts of goods are 
 for sale often at bargain prices.     
 Most Southam shops close on Wednesday 
 afternoon.                            
  In the summer months when the soft   
 fruit is available, many people go to 
 nearby Stockton to pick their own     
 fruit at the farms there.             </content>
