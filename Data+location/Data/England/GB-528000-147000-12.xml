 the middle school children look out   
 onto.It has lots of trees around it   
 and looks onto{Lyttel Hall.}We have   
 showers in the changing rooms which   
 come in useful in{x country}runs.Most 
 people enjoy the school meals, but if 
 you don't then you can have packed    
 lunches.                              
     The school is a modern building   
 with{2 huts}one used as a store the
