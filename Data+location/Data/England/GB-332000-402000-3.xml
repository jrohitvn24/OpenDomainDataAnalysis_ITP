		<title>03THE WOODLAND INCE BLUNDELL</title>
		<content>    The woodland is this area stands   
 out in sharp contrast to the low-lying
 landscape.  Most of the trees are     
 planted in small "clumps" to form     
 windbreaks around houses and fields.  
                                       
    The most extensive area of woodland
 lies within the park wall.            
                                       
    The prettiest part of this is known
 locally as the "Westicroft".  Much of 
 it was planted by Charles             
 Weld-Blundell as a pleasant walk for  
 his wife.  We counted 25 different    
 species of trees including both       
 deciduous and conifers. Between the   
 trees are wide woodland paths of lush 
 grass scattered with primroses and    
 wild-violets.
