		<content> Miss Florence Bechelet has been       
 entering in the annual Battle of      
 Flowers for the past fifty years and  
 for most of them has entered the wild 
 flower class. She has won many awards 
 and since 1971 has displayed all      
 her floats at the museum which she    
 opened in that year.                  
                                       
 So famous is her work that stamps have
 been issued featuring one of her      
 floats and in 1978 she made a special 
 float consisting of forty flamingos to
 show the Queen on her official visit  
 to the Island.                        
                                       
 The Battle of Flowers is held every   
 year in early August but visitors to  
 the Island can see some of the skill  
 and patience which goes into these    
 floats when they visit this Museum at 
 any time of the year.                 </content>
