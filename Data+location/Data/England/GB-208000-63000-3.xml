 The Mindel family moved to Cornwall in
 May, 1985, from Reading having        
 previously come for a holiday.  They  
 contacted an estate agent who found   
 them the property - {Glynn Barton Farm
 at {Cardinham.} Although they were    
 happy in Reading they love it here in 
 Cornwall and find the pace of life    
 slower.  Their new rural surroundings 
 are very different from the urban     
 district in Berkshire.                
 Mr. Mindel is an air cabin steward    
 working from {Heathrow  Airport.} He  
 commutes from {Heathrow} to {St.      
{Mawgan} every weekend.  He wants to   
 maintain his income for another five  
 years by keeping up his job while the 
 family set up their new business in { 
{self-catering cottages }which they    
 hope will be ready by the Spring '86.
