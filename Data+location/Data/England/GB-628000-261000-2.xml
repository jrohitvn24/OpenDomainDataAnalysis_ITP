		<title>02Tourism, Framlingham Castle</title>
		<content>                                       
There has been a castle in Framlingham 
since Saxon times. Many famous families
have lived there, the Bigods, the      
Mowbrays, and the Howards- the Dukes of
Norfolk. Henry 11 besieged the castle, 
the Duke of Norfolk married his nieces 
Ann Boleyn and Catherine Howard to     
Henry V111; Mary Tudor came here to    
raise an army so she could claim the   
throne.                                
Mr. Slade, the custodian of the castle,
told us about eighty thousand people   
each year visit the castle. They are of
different nationalities, mainly English
but American, French, Dutch, and German
come in great numbers.                 
Most people enjoy their visit but some 
say it is a ruin, this is partly true  
as only the curtain wall remains. Mr.  
Slade says he has felt hands on his    
shoulders walking the castle at night! </content>
