		<title>12MITCHELDEAN SECONDARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   1985 will be remembered as a very   
 important year in the history of      
 Secondary education in the Mitcheldean
 area. After several years of          
 discussion the Abenhall Secondary     
 Modern School at Mitcheldean became an
 11 to 16 Comprehensive, and changed   
 its name to Dene Magna School.        
   Before this date Mitcheldean and    
 Drybrook children went either to      
 Abenhall or the Royal Forest of Dean  
 Grammar School, which is outside the  
 block, near Coleford.                 
   However children staying on after   
 the age of 16 will still have to      
 travel, as the Grammar School became a
 Tertiary College serving Dene Magna   
 and other Secondary Comprehensive     
 schools in the eastern and central    
 area of the Forest of Dean.
