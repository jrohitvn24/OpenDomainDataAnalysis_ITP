		<title>08DARTMOUTH'S LOCAL PAPER</title>
		<content>   {The Dartmouth Chronicle }sold its  
 first newspaper in{1854.}The chronicle
 is more popular now than it was over a
 century ago.However many people say   
 it was a better newspaper a couple of 
 months ago when the news was just     
 about{Dartmouth.}It now contains news 
 about Kingsbridge and many areas      
 around Dartmouth.Many other people say
 they would recommend it to a newcomer.
                                       
    The{chronicle}is not a paper that  
 would interest children.The reporter  
 of the chronicle says that she hopes  
 in the future she'll be able to make  
 about a page for{children}to include  
 puzzles and games.Most people get the 
 chronicle every week not because it   
 is a particually good paper but for   
 the local news.  People's favourite   
 articles vary. Some like the sports,  
 many read the advertisements.         </content>
