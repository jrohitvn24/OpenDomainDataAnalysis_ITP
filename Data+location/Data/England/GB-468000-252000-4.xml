Although in 1985 there are no shops    
open in Gayton there are two mobile    
grocers that visit the village each    
week. Most people, however  do their   
shopping in Northampton.               
 This chart shows the relative prices  
of articles bought from the mobiles    
and from a supermarket in Northampton. 
{ARTICLE   Cost/Village  Cost/N'pton}  
Sugar        55p           47p         
Bread        50p           32p         
Butter       52p           46p         
Tomatoes     50p           45p         
Tea         170p          120p         
Coffee      325p          267p         
Milk         23p           22p         
Eggs         86p           68p         
                                       
In all cases it was dearer to buy in   
the village but this was without the   
cost of travelling to Northampton.     </content>
