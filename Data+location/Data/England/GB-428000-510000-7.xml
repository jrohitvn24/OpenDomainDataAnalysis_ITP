		<content> Hurworth used to be very small.There  
 were only a few roads.Nearly all of   
 the people knew each other.There was  
 once a bus that went round called the 
 Gas Bag.At school the boys were in one
 playground and the girls in another.  
 There were 18-20 children in a class. 
 For punishment they would be hit on   
 the knuckles with a ruler.They used to
 dance round the maypole on the green  
 and if they did they got a badge or   
 spoon.On a Saturday everybody would   
 have a wash then have a good supper as
 their treat.At home the girls couldn't
 get changed in front of the boys and  
 vice versa.There wasn't a bathroom in 
 the house so they got washed in a room
 in the yard.The girls slept with their
 mum and the boys with their dad.
