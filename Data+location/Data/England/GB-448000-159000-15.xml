		<content>    In 1978 the ancient tradition of   
 holding the{Rogationtide Procession}  
 was restored.The procession stops at  
 various points to bless a farm or     
 garden.More recently this has been    
 extended to a walk around the whole of
 the United Benefice,for a service in  
 each of the five churches in          
 turn.Another custom revived is the    
{Harvest Supper}which traditionally was
 held by each farmer in his biggest    
 barn,but is now held in the Village   
 Hall for the whole community.         
    The centenary of St.Lawrence's     
 church has been celebrated with       
 various events during the year        
 including a{flower festival,fete,clay 
{pigeon shoot and a musical evening.}At
 the{Centenary Day Communion Service}  
 100 replicas of the St.Lawrence cross 
 on a griddle,symbolising his fiery    
 death,were distributed.               </content>
