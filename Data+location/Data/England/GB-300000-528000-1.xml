		<title>01UPPIES AND DOWNIES</title>
		<content> Uppies and Downies is a traditional   
 game played at Easter for as long as  
 anyone can remember. The game is      
 played on the Cloffocks  field. The   
 aim is for the Uppies to ground, or   
 'hail', the ball at Curwen Hall and   
 for the Downies to hail it at the quay
 of the harbour.There are no rules and 
 no teams (anyone can join in, if they 
 dare).The ball is made of leather,    
 stuffed with phlox.                   
 The sponsors of the game for about 500
 years have been the Daglish family    
 The shortest games last only a few    
 minutes, but the longest lasted until 
 3 o-clock in the morning.             
 Although most games are fairly law    
 abiding, there have been deaths,      
 including drowning in the river       
 Derwent.Local shopkeepers along the   
 route board up their windows.         
 The long tradition goes on!.          </content>
