		<content>   The {Earls of Coventry}have played a
 big part in the history and           
 development of the area. It was the   
 Sixth Earl who was resposible for some
 of the more distinguished buildings in
 Severn Stoke. The Panorama on top of  
 Knights Hill was built as a signal    
 tower. The watchman kept a look-out   
 here for the Earl's coaches and       
 signalled his arrival to Croome Court,
 so the gates could be opened without  
 delay. He also built a harness house  
 for hanging the horse leathers, which 
 still stands by the A38, south of the 
 village. In 1840, he built a large    
 house at Severn Bank for his French   
 Mistress, which is now used as a      
 retirement home.
