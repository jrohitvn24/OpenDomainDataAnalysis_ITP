		<title>05Parish Magazine of Hanley's</title>
		<content>  About 530 copies of the magazine are 
 prepared each month,usually of between
 20-28 pages.305 of these magazines are
 for the two Hanley villages.In Hanley,
 the loose sheets and covers are       
 stapled together,again by voluntary   
 helpers,and taken to another volunteer
 who inserts the Bishop's newsletter   
 and any loose notes (the magazine has 
 proved a very useful free postal      
 service on occasion) and then takes   
 bundles to 14 distributors.These      
 latter deliver the magazine all over  
 the parish to nearly 300 homes;a few  
 are sent by post to people who have   
 moved away from the area.
