		<title>01Leysters and Bockleton</title>
		<content> A high ridge,the watershed between the
 Teme and the Lugg, runs through these 
 two parishes. Both are well wooded as 
 a result of extensive tree planting in
 Leysters in th 19th century and of the
 management of the large Bockleton     
 estate until recent times.            
                                       
 There are now many small farms in both
 the parishes, the houses are scattered
 throughout the area.                  
                                       
 The former Bockleton Court is now a   
 Field study centre run by Birmingham  
 education committee.                  
                                       
 Both the village schools are now      
 private houses.
