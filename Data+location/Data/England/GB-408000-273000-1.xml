   This rural area is largely "made up"
 of two villages; Tidbury Green and    
 Earlswood.There are many farms_       
 meat,dairy and crop growing.Part of   
 the Stratford on Avon canal runs      
 through the area as does part of the  
 Stratford to Birmingham(Moor St.)     
 railway line,known  as the            
 Warwickshire line.A further feature   
 of the area are the Earlswood Lakes   
 which were built originally as a      
 "feeder" for the Stratford Canal.     
  Tidbury Green is a small village     
 between Dickens Heath and Grimes Hill 
 where four roads meet. It was first   
 recorded in 1840.Historically it was  
 all part of the Forest of Arden and   
 there is evidence of this in that     
 there are several areas of woodland   
 remaining today.
