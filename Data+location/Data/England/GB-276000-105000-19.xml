		<content> The{Thatcher}-The main thatching      
 business has been in the same family  
 for several generations.Norfolk reed  
 is so expensive nowadays that most    
 reed is imported from Austria and     
 Hungary.When wheat straw is used it is
 obtained mainly from local farmers and
 is known as reed straw.Long straw     
 thatching is rarely used now due to   
 the modern harvesting machinery...    
 however the implements used have not  
 altered and are still as they         
 originally were.Recently,grants have  
 been available for re-thatching which 
 has helped to revive the craft as well
 as renovation of old cottages.
