		<title>17FOOTBALL MATCH VIOLENCE</title>
		<content>{ In recent months, lots of people have
 got killed at football matches, like  
 the one at Bradford City ground,where 
 there was a fire. It was probably     
 caused by a cigarette being put in a  
 cup,which was knocked over into some  
 newspapers catching them alight. Soon 
 the whole stand was alight. Policemen 
 were throwing people onto the grass   
 who were on fire. In Brussels, many   
 people were killed because of trouble 
 between the fans of Juventus and      
 Liverpool,who caused a wall to        
 collapse on top of the fans.Ambulance 
 people took a long time to get there. 
 Mrs. Thatcher said no alcholic drinks 
 were to be allowed into the stadiums  
 and English teams have been banned    
 from playing abroad,because of the    
 trouble the fans cause. It is sad that
 our football teams cannot play in     
 other countries because of their fans.</content>
