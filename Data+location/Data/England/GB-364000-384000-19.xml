		<content> Lymmville is the local coach hire     
 company.  It is an independent, family
 run firm.  The yard where they are    
 located is on the main Warrington road
 out of Lymm, near to the Thelwall     
 Viaduct carrying the M6.              
 The owner started out by hiring out   
 his minibus, which he drove, in l97O. 
 The company has slowly grown until now
 he owns 6 coaches.  Five of these have
 45 seats, the other one has 53 - but  
 there is no minibus.                  
 The staff of Lymmville consist of the 
 owner and his son who work as drivers;
 there are two other full time drivers 
 and one part-time driver, as well as a
 mechanic who also drives.  There is   
 also an apprentice mechanic who is on 
 a YTS scheme, and an office girl.The  
 coaches are driven all over the       
 country,and cover 3OOOO miles per year
 but income comes from local contracts.</content>
