		<content> There are few amenities in the block. 
 Some of Little Bytham's amenities (the
 church, Post Office, petrol pump, shop
 and one of its two pubs) are only just
 outside our block, but people still   
 have to travel well outside the area  
 for much of their shopping, education,
 sports activities, health care and    
 entertainment. Little Bytham's Village
 Hall (also just outside the block) is 
 our bingo, disco and theatre! A mobile
 library visits once a fortnight.      
  Little Bytham's small private gallery
 used to open regularly, but is now in 
 less frequent use. The ground floor is
 a pottery and sculpture studio.       
  Little Bytham Station, closed about  
 18 years ago, is now used by track    
 maintenance teams and as warehousing. 
 The nearest stations are Stamford (7  
 miles), Peterborough (20 miles), and  
 Grantham (14 miles).                  </content>
