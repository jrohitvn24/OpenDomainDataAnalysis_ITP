		<title>06A MAY DAY IN CHALFORD</title>
		<content>                                       
 One May morning at a quarter to six l 
 went for a May Walk,with my mother    
 and brother Pierre.We went with my    
 mum's friends from near the           
 barleyfield.We walked though the      
 woods and ended up at Oakridge and    
 then came back home.                  
  In the afternoon we had visitors,they
 stayed for dinner,after dinner we went
 to the Village Fete.I had a go in the 
 maze and on a trick bike,when you turn
 right it goes left and when you turn  
 left it goes right.I had a go on the  
 death slide across the river,and      
 entered the bike competition.Then I   
 had an ice_cream before I went        
 home.                                 
   Years ago all the young people in   
 the village used to go on May Walks to
 collect flowers and leaves to         
 celebrate the coming of summer.       </content>
