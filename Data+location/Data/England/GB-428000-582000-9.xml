		<content>                                       
 This haulage company began in 1918 and
 was founded by two brothers, Theodore 
 and Ernest James.The partnership split
 up and Theodore James was left with   
 the firm.In 1978 the company moved    
 from Bedlington Station to West       
 Sleekburn and this has proved to be a 
 much better location.The present site 
 was owned by Northern Concrete( part  
 of Tar-Mac Limited).                  
      The site consists of 7.46 acres  
 of land and when they first came to   
 the location there was a lot of grass 
 land which has now been built over.The
 main disadvantage is that it is not   
 very easy to drive vehicles in and    
 out.The vehicles include 25 heavy     
 goods wagons,20 trailers,3 forklifts,1
 pallet truck and three heavy trucks.
