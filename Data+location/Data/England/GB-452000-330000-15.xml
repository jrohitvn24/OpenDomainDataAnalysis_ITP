		<content>  Roger Heaton is a well-known animal  
 artist, who works in a converted barn 
 in Barton-in-Fabis.There is a gallery 
 on the ground floor,where there is a  
 wide variety of paintings on display  
 and upstairs is the studio where he   
 paints.He has now been painting full- 
 time for eight years after training at
 Nottingham Art College and Hornsea    
 College in North London.He works in   
 both oils and watercolours and states 
 that he does not have a preference    
 between them.His watercolour paintings
 and pastel drawings take between four 
 and six weeks to complete whilst his  
 oil paintings take much longer.The    
 price of his work varies considerably.
 If several animals appear in a        
 portrait the cost is greater.He likes 
 to paint cats because they are so     
 unpredictable and he prefers to paint 
 them at play.                         </content>
