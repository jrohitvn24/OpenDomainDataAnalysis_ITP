		<title>01A DESCRIPTION OF THE D_BLOCK</title>
		<content>    In general terms the Block         
 comprises Hale, Hale Barns and Ashley 
 and is divided almost equally between 
 suburban housing in the southern limit
 of{Trafford Metropolitan District}and 
 the farmland of{Cheshire,}south of the
 River Bollin.  On the whole the houses
 are either semi_detached or even      
 larger detached properties standing in
 extensive grounds and any estates are 
 small and privately owned. Some larger
 houses have been converted into flats 
 or offices as trade benefits from the 
 nearby airport.  There are two small  
 shopping areas in Hale and Hale Barns 
 but as bus services are limited       
 residents rely on the railway or      
 public transport.  The area's many    
 farms conventrate on cereal crops and 
 the Bollin attracts many hikers. These
 peaceful suburbs are pleasant, wealthy
 and unspoilt by industry.             </content>
