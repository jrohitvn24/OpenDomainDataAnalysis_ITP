		<title>06The Mires,Snape, Yorkshire.</title>
		<content>   The Mires are found at the north    
 east end of the village.There are 3   
 farms there.The farmers use the fields
 for crops,pasture and hay.The Mires   
 flood in winter and in heavy rain.The 
 rain washes away the fertiliser and   
 kills worms that are in the soil.In   
 the early 19th century the Mires were 
 drained by means of stells.Some of the
 stells are very deep.The Mires is a   
 pleasant place to go for a walk       
 because it is quiet.There are 2 lanes 
 to walk down.There is quite a lot of  
 wildlife to be seen including foxes,  
 deer and rabbits.
