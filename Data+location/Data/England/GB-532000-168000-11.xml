		<content>   The Police in South Norwood are good
 community police as they get to know  
 their area and the people living in   
 it. There is also a scheme of         
 Schools/police liason officers. Each  
 officer has to deal with many schools 
 in his area and build up a            
 relationship with them. He teaches    
 them a little bit about the law,      
 organises police quizzes between      
 schools, and shows children that the  
 police are there to help. The police  
 liason officer for my school said he  
 wanted to be a policeman becauses he  
 wanted to help people. They also show 
 films about police work.
