		<title>02A Day In The Life Of H Pope</title>
		<content> I woke up at half past seven and got  
 changed. I had cornflakes and a drink 
 of hot chocolate for breakfast. Then I
 had a wash and got ready for school.  
 I set off at eight forty with my hair 
 up for swimming. When I reached school
 our group started on maths. We worked 
 until playtime.Then after play our    
 group went to Mrs Clarke,to do some   
 writing. We watched a television      
 program about electronic games and how
 they are made. After the program we   
 had to write a short description about
 what kind of electronic game we would 
 like to invent. When we had finished  
 it was nearly time for lunch so we    
 read for 15 minutes.After dinner our  
 class went swimming. After swimming we
 listened to story and finished school 
 at three o' clock.  At five o'clock   
 I go skating. I go to bed at nine     
 o'clock and read for a few minutes.   </content>
