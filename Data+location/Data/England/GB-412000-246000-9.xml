		<title>09Pebworth Church Bells</title>
		<content> An appeal began in l984 to restore the
 5 bells of St. Peter's Church,        
 Pebworth and to add a 6th bell to     
 complete the peal. The Â£l7,000 needed 
 to refurbish them and to replace the  
 wooden ringing frame with a metal one,
 is being raised by covenants,         
 donations, grants and village events. 
 The bells, weighing 2 tons, were      
 lowered                               
 from the tower by volunteers and put  
 on show in the church for the lst time
 in 300 years. A 6th bell was purchased
 and taken with the others to Oxford   
 for refurbishing and tuning. The      
 belfry floor will be strengthened to  
 support the new bell frame.  The      
 church clock has, meanwhile, been     
 stopped. A team of young ringers will 
 be ready to ring the full peal in     
 l986.
