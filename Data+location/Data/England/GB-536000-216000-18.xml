		<title>18AN INTERVIEW WITH CHAS.</title>
		<content> Whilst making a survey on our area we 
 came across a pop singer,{CHAS,}of the
 pop group,"Chas &amp; Dave".He very kindly
 allowed us to interview him about the 
 area.                                 
{Q.What made you decide to live in this
{area and how much land do you own ?   
 A.I have lived here for 3 yrs and own 
 4 acres of grazing land.I decided on  
 it because it is relaxing after my    
 hectic profession,&amp; it's easy to      
 commute to London.                    
{Q.How did Bakers End get its name?  } 
 A.Bakers End was as far as the baker  
 would deliver the bread in the old    
 days                                  
{Q.What advantages are there,in living 
{in Bakers End,rather than London?}    
 A.You get the best of both worlds.I   
 enjoy the peace of the countryside,   
 yet I can be right in the centre of   
 London within 1 hour.                 </content>
