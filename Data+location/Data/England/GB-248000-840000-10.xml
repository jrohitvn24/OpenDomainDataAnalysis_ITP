		<title>10MEGSTONE-A WITCH'S TALE</title>
		<content> Megstone is a huge boulder at the     
 entrance to Belladrum farm beside the 
 A833.The story about 'Meg's Stone' is 
 that she was a{witch},and when she    
 died,two men were carrying her coffin 
 to the graveyard.They stopped at the  
 pub to have a drink.They were so drunk
 that they could not carry the coffin  
 any further so they made a hole in the
 ground and put the coffin in the hole.
 Then they rolled a huge stone over    
 it.There is a piece of metal sticking 
 out of the rock and there is a rumour 
 that every night at midnight a metal  
 cross rises out of the stone.         
 It is quite probable that the boulder 
 was deposited by glacial action       
 during the ice age,and most people now
 treat the story as no more than an    
 interesting legend.
