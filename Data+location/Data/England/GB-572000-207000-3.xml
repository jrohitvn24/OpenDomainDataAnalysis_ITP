		<title>03Boreham House</title>
		<content>{Boreham House}was called the Institute
 of Agriculture until 1948.In 1954 it  
 changed to{Ford UK.}Then it changed   
 again and has since been a worldwide  
 trading and training centre.Ever since
{Henry Ford}bought the house and 3000  
 acres in 1930,it has been a kind of   
 school.Gradually acres of land were   
 sold to different people and now Ford 
 have only 60 acres.When we went inside
 the house and walked around a bit we  
 went up the stairs and looked at them.
 They were made of oak.The strange     
 thing about the stairs was that they  
 went round all four sides of the room 
 and weren't supported by pillars or   
 anything.Then we went down into the   
 cellars.There was a boiler room with a
 bar in.Mr.Thomson said he had been    
 there since 1966.Students normally    
 come in groups of 28 for one week     
 courses.There were 36 employees.      </content>
