		<title>06A QUEENBOROUGH WEDDING</title>
		<content>    On Saturday my Auntie got married  
 in Queenborough Church. I was a       
 bridesmaid and my brother was a page  
 boy. I had a lilac dress, lilac       
 head-dress and a pink and white       
 bouquet. My brother wore black and    
 white. My auntie wore a white wedding 
 dress. My nan wore lilac, beige and   
 grey. My mum wore red and khaki.      
    After the wedding we went to       
 Abbott's Club. The best man made a    
 speech and so did my uncle and my     
 grandad. Later on in the evening more 
 people came and then I went round with
 trays of wedding cake. Then there was 
 dancing for the rest of the evening.  
 My mum stayed wuth some other people  
 to clear up.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
