		<content> The level land of this block lies in  
 the Mendip Hills and is part farmland 
 and part heath. There is no access to 
 the heath (used as firing ranges by   
 the Army) where the rare red-footed   
 falcon is seen. the Mendips have lead 
 ore and caves but here there is no    
 mining, no obvious subsidence and only
 one cave - Lambs Lair. The B3134      
 follows the straight course of a road 
 linking Roman mining settlements.     
 Between fields there are either       
 drystone walls draped with ferns or   
 shrubby hedges with foliose lichens,  
 demonstrating the moist atmosphere.   
 There are some conifer plantations and
 old beech at Gibbets Brow but no      
 village or any new building: two      
 public houses at crossroads are       
 prosperous. One Priddy circle lies    
 in the block near a radiotransmitter  
 and the map shows many sites of tumuli</content>
