		<title>17Uckington Village Survey</title>
		<content> Uckington is situated on the A4019    
 better known as the Tewkesbury road.  
 It is a quiet village with about 20   
 houses.It has two telephone boxes,one 
 church and a village hall.Most people 
 like the area because it is peaceful. 
 Most people own a car because the     
 village is quite far from any shops,  
 post offices and super markets.There  
 is a bus service twice a week to and  
 from Cheltenham.It is a poor service  
 because often it is late or doesn't   
 even turn up.The children go to school
 in Cheltenham or Bishops Cleave. There
 are a lot of farms which surround the 
 village. Most have big barns with hay 
 in. A Forge is in Uckington.The Forge 
 sells and makes products like garden  
 gates and fire grates.Most of the work
 is hand made.
