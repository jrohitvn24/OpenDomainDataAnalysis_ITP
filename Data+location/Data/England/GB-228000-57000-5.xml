		<content>  We surveyed Morview Estate to find   
 out information about the people who  
 live there and the way they live.We   
 did not get replies from everyone,but 
 we got some interesting facts. Almost 
 every house has a car.We expected this
 because people without a car would    
 probably not buy a house at Widegates.
 There are two buses each day to Looe  
 and two to Plymouth. Almost everyone  
 said they would like a better service 
 of public transport.More than half of 
 the houses we surveyed were occupied  
 by people who are retired from work.  
 They had come to live there because   
 they lived in the area and wanted a   
 new  house to retire into,or because  
 they like the climate and counytryside
 of Cornwall.
