		<title>08Ponteland Plan Proposals</title>
		<content> There will be emphasis on amendments  
 to boundaries for the{Green Belt,}    
 reducing the rate of building to only 
 180 by 1996 on selected sites.A{Bypass
  line approved by the Department of   
 Transport with a link road.Sites      
 identified in village centre for new  
{Shopping }facilities.An extension of  
 the {Conservation Area}is proposed.   
   Following the publication of this   
 Plan and a local exhibition, concern  
 has been expressed over the new Green 
 Belt boundaries which might lead to   
 undesirable development of land.The   
 future of Local Authority housing drew
 the attention of the County Council   
 who thought the position needed       
 clarifying-private or L.A.housing?    
   The {Northumbria Police Authority } 
 expressed concern that the Bypass     
 would cut off 7 acres of playing field
 at their Headquarters now in Ponteland</content>
