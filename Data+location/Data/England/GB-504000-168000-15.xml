		<content>{ All Saints Church}is Laleham School's
 affiliated Evangelical Church.The     
 Church was founded in the 12th        
 century.The pillars,arcade and west   
 wall are built of chalk_stone and     
 above the South Arcade are the remains
 of a Norman doorway.Alterations made  
 to the church through the last 7      
 centuries include the south aisle and 
 chancel which were taken down in Tudor
 times.The South arcade was bricked up 
 and a red brick arch were built,the   
 latter lasting only until the 18th    
 century when the present chancel was  
 built.The tower is 45 feet high and   
 was built in 1828 and later Gothic    
 type windows were installed.All the   
 original roofs and doors were replaced
 early this century.The Chancel        
 Chandelier was originally used        
 in Westminister Abbey.
