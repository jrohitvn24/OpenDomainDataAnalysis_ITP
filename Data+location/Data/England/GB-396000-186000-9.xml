		<content>    For over 100 years there was a     
 school at Lea, for children from Lea  
 and Garsdon, and one in Charlton with 
 about 30 pupils each. In 1976, to the 
 regret of many people in Charlton, the
 schools were combined into the one in 
 Lea - called Lea and Garsdon. As Lea  
 School only had one large schoolroom  
 and a small side room it was necessary
 to build a new section onto it- two   
 new double classrooms to take up to   
 120 children.                         
    Children from Charlton, Garsdon and
 Milbourne have to come in daily by    
 special bus. At the moment there are  
 just over 70 children.                
    Two lady teachers share a double   
 classroom for infants and young       
 juniors. The Headteacher, with a      
 part-time teacher one day a week,     
 teaches the older children in the     
 other double classroom.               </content>
