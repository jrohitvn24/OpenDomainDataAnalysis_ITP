		<content>{Bulldog}is a favourite game of mine.  
 A group of people stay in the         
 semi-circle and one person stays      
 outside the semi-circle that is marked
 on our playground. The person outside 
 is said to be "on" and he has to call 
 a person's name out and this person   
 has to try and run to a semi-circle   
 marked at the other end of the        
 playground. If he is caught he is on  
 with the first person to be on. The   
 game ends when everyone is caught.    
{Elastic}is a game the girls play. We  
 use a piece of elastic that is about  
 two metres in length and joined       
 together to make it rectangular in    
 shape when two girls put it around    
 their legs. The girl whose turn it is 
 jumps on it and makes all sorts of    
 difficult and easy moves.
