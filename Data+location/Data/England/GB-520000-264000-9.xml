		<content>  The village has changed greatly over 
 the past ten years,mainly because of  
 the large housing estate which has    
 been built.The population has risen to
 almost nine hundred and now the       
 village has softball,football and     
 netball teams, a squash club,a juinor 
 club and a Brownie pack.The village   
 shop closed down in 1983 because  the 
 owner  Mr Waller retired .No one took 
 over the Post Office part of the shop,
 and it is greatly missed.The old      
 peaple have to go to St Neots to      
 collect there pensions and they miss  
 the food it sold, like bread, milk,   
 cheese, etc.The children,too, miss the
 shop beacause they enjoyed going to   
 shop for sweets.The school may be     
 closed and merged with the school in  
 Offord.
