		<title>11A small fen farm 2</title>
		<content>   Mr. Green is a local farmer, he has 
 about 20 fields and grows mostly crops
 but in the winter he keeps beefeaters.
 Beefeaters are store cattle.          
   His favourite crop is sugar-beet    
 mainly because he makes more money out
 of it.                                
   He sells potatoes to local merchants
 who in turn sell them to wholesalers, 
 who pack them and take them to local  
 stores. He sells his corn crop to the 
 local farmers co-operative. They buy  
 corn from many farmers and sell them  
 in big quantities to firms like Hovis 
 and MacDougals.                       
   His sugarbeet crop is grown and sold
 under contract to the British Sugar   
 Corporation. These are refined in     
 their factory in Peterborough. He is  
 only allowed to grow a certain amount 
 each year and is paid a guaranteed    
 price.                                </content>
