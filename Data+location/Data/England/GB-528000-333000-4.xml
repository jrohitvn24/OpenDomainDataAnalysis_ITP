 We were going to Birmingham to a      
 christening of my Aunty Samantha's

 left.It was a long journey to where we
 were going.The place we were going to 
 was Atherstone.We got there after a   
 long journey 2hrs 30 mins it took us. 
 When we got there,there was a mess the
 house was a mess.Then we saw nan and  
 grandad cooking."Oh" yes  my nan      
 doesn't do the cooking my grandad     
 does.The doorbell went and there was  
 Aunty Samantha and my Uncle Keith,with
