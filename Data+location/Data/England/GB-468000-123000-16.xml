		<content> Tooling Products is one of the largest
 mould manufacturers in Britain. Its   
 raw materials are supplied from the   
 north of England and its product is   
 delivered anywhere by its heavy duty  
 lorries.{The main product is BUMPERS} 
 for the motor industry built to       
 specification. It has its own training
 scheme of a four year apprenticeship  
 where trainees learn skills on the    
 modern computerized machinery. There  
 are several types of moulding employed
 at Tooling Products: Injection        
 moulding, Compression moulding and Rim
 moulding (RIM is ReInforced Moulding).
 It is quite a successful industry as  
 it employs 150 personel and has a     
 turnover of about Â£4m a year. The     
 plastics which it uses come in bags   
 of plastic pellets which are melted   
 down for easier moulding. It was built
 during the war.                       </content>
