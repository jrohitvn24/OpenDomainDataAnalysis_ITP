		<title>10Young Offenders in Salterton</title>
		<content>                                       
  We interviewed a police constable and
 he told us that there was quite a lot 
 of drinking in Budleigh Salterton but 
 not many young people were picked up  
 for drunkeness.There is a lot of      
 vandalism,such as destroying public   
 benches and fences and paint spraying.
 Many old people complain to the       
 police about young people playing     
 their music and annoying old people in
 their houses.                         
 Many young people are involved in     
 stealing.The policeman thought that   
 there should be more youth groups in  
 the town as many youngsters have no   
 hobbies and just spend their time at  
 night hanging around the streets.A    
 child can be arrested for a suspected 
 offence when they are ten years old.
