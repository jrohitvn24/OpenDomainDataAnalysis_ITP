 Six people make a circle round an     
 object.One person gives everyone a    
 name and calls one out. That person   
 runs round the circle. He must get    
 back to his place then run to the     
 middle to pick up the object. In the  
 next game that person calls out the   
 name.                                 
{Creep Mouse }                         
 One person stands against a wall with 
 his back to everyone else.The other   
 players creep up behind him. If he    
 turns round and sees someone move that
 person goes back to the start.If      
 someone creeps up without being seen  
 and touches the watcher he shouts     
 "Creep Mouse!" Then he is the watcher.
