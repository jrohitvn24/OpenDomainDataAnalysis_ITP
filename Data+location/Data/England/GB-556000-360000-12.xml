		<title>12VISITORS TO SKEGNESS</title>
		<content> In Skegness we have hundreds of       
 visitors every year.Most              
 residents attitudes to the visitors   
 are that they think they own          
 Skegness.There are many different     
 attitudes to the visitors.Around 20%  
 of the residents like the visitors    
 coming to Skegness and around 80% of  
 the residents dislike the visitors    
 coming because of the noise,the litter
 and the crowds.But sometimes it feels 
 nice to have Skegness occupied again  
 after the lonliness of the winter.    
 Lumley Road is the busiest spot in    
 Skegness because it is surrounded by  
 shops.It is the main shopping area.In 
 the summer it is very difficult to    
 walk down Lumley Road as it is so     
 crowded.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
