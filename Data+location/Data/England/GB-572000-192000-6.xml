		<content> Farming in Wickford is generally      
 Arable or Dairy.There are only a few  
 nurseries and no market gardens.      
   The farms are of a dispersed pattern
 and are not very far away from        
 Wickford town centre.There are no     
 sheep farms in this area.             
   The Crouch valley is not very well  
 drained and is often subject to       
 extensive flooding.While the outskirts
 of the area slopes quite a lot,and is 
 well drained also it is a lighter soil
 .The main crops grown in this area are
 oil seed rape for which the farmers   
 are given a government subsidy.Barley 
 and Wheat are grown in large fields to
 allow for mechanisation.The crop      
 output is high if the weather during  
 the spring has been good and the rain 
 fall average.Other crops grown include
 :cattle beans and fodder crops.
