 HOUSING IS MAINLY OWNED PROPERTY BUT  
 THERE ARE COUNCIL HOUSES AND OLD      
 PEOPLES BUNGALOWS IN THE AREA. SOME   
 FARMERS HAVE TIED COTTAGES AVAILABLE  
 FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. THIS MEANS THEY  
 WILL LIVE IN THE PROPERTY OWNED BY THE
 FARMER FOR NO PAYMENT AS LONG AS THEY 
 ARE EMPLOYED THERE.                   
                                       
 PROPERTY IN THE AREA IS LESS EXPENSIVE
 AND THEREFORE MOST HOUSES HAVE QUITE  
 ALOT OF LAND. THIS OBVIOUSLY MAKES    
 THEM MORE ATTRACTIVE TO PEOPLE FROM   
 THE NEARBY CITY OF PETERBOROUGH WHERE 
 LAND IS MORE EXPENSIVE.
