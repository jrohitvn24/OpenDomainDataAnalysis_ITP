		<content> Petworth House is in the north_west   
 part of Petworth.It was built by the  
 sixth Duke of Somerset in 1688 and is 
 now owned by the National Trust.The   
 house is 312 feet long nd 50 feet     
 wide.The biggest room is the carved   
 room where they have a big problem    
 because Gibbons wood carvings are     
 crumbling away because of wood        
 worm.Also the grand                   
 staircase ceiling ia threatened by    
 repairs to the roof.The oldest        
 sculpture they have got in the house  
 was made in the fourth century before 
 Christ and is called Aphrodite and is 
 worth Â£1,000,000.There is a           
 special                               
 room in the house which displays some 
 of William Turner's paintings of the  
 park.Lord Egremont lives in the       
 south_end part of the house.
