		<content> Millbrook Church is a quite big church
 and it overlooks the village aS it is 
 on a big hill.On a very clear day you 
 can see the Wash.There are two main   
 routes up to the church,either a steep
 hill or a dirt track.The church did   
 have a clock on the wall but they     
 dismantled it because it went wrong.  
 Sir &amp; Lady Richardson were  buried    
 there.They were the people who owned  
 Avenue House in Church Street Ampthill
 which is now a Historical place.Lord &amp;
 Lady Holland of Park House Ampthill   
 had a daughter about 120 years ago,   
 Georgina Fox ,who died at the age of  
 eleven.Doctor Alan,librarian of the   
 house,liked her so much he left a     
 trust fund of ten shillings (50p) to  
 eleven girls under the age of eleven  
 and that live in Millbrook.The whole  
 family plus Dr Alan are buried in the 
 churchyard.                           </content>
