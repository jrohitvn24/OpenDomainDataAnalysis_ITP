		<title>11TOLMERS NATIONAL SCOUT CAMP.</title>
		<content> The land for Tolmers Scout Camp was   
 first bought in 1939, at the beginning
 of the Second World War. There are 70 
 acres of pasture, and 30 acres of     
 woodland. During the war, farmers     
 moved onto the land, and used it for  
 growing their crops. At the end of the
 war the Scout Association had a very  
 hard job getting back the land, which 
 still belonged to them. When the      
 railway to Hertford was built, the    
 bricks that were used for building    
 Ponsbourne Tunnel were made on the    
 site. There are still some remains of 
 the kilns in the North-East corner of 
 the site.When they dug away the earth 
 from the slope, the sides of the track
 were left with gaps in them. This made
 them unsafe, so some Victorian rubbish
 dumps from Islington were brought out 
 to fill in the holes.Some interesting 
 'treasures' have been found here.     </content>
