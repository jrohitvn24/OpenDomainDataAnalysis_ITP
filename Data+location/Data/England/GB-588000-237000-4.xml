The O.S. map shows a large number of   
small farms, but it seems that many of 
these have become amalgamated today. De
Greys Farm is typical for this area. It
has been owned by the same family since
1905. It consists of 500 acres overall 
and has, within this, 20 acres of      
woodland. The farmer employs four men  
and grows crops such as wheat,(140     
acres) barley, (120 acres) oats,(10    
acres) tick beans,(55acres) and        
rape,(38 acres).                       
 In addition, there are several fruit  
orchards, a herb and wild-flower farm  
and a mushroom farm. Finally, another  
farm boasts one of the few herds of    
Jersey cows to be found in this part of
the country.
