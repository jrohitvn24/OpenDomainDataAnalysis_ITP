		<title>14Our Church</title>
		<content> Coddington church is the only church  
 in our area and is near an ancient    
 tumulus. Leaflets in church tell us   
 that it was built after 1833 when the 
 old church of 1093 was demolished     
 because it was unsafe. The rectory is 
 now a private house and the present   
 vicar lives 5 miles away in Farndon.  
 The belfry has one bell which I have  
 rung and the church clock was made    
 in Whitchurch. In the church the East 
 window was given by the Aldersey      
 family who were chief landowners      
 nearby. The Massie vault and coat of  
 arms is to remember the family who    
 lived at Coddington Hall.             
 Last year they found that the church  
 needed Â£7,000 for repairs and we have 
 had sponsored disco's, and donations  
 which have already made this money.   
 Our services are at 11 o'clock every  
 Sunday and about 15 people attend.    </content>
