		<content>{Redhill Farm Pottery:}Mr and Mrs      
 Harris make small pottery animals and 
 larger Old Testament figures. Because 
 of their Christian beliefs they have  
 chosen the 'Fish' sign to stamp their 
 work, which is widely sold both       
 locally and in America.{Alpine        
{Nursery,Broadwell:}Mr Elliott started 
 his alpine nursery in 1946, selling   
 slow-growing, hardy little plants     
 normally grown in mountainous areas.  
 They are suitable for rock gardens,   
 troughs and pots. People come hundreds
 of miles to buy from the attractive   
 farm yard where plants are grown from 
 cuttings and seeds.{Chair-making,     
{Oddington:}Mr Sparling makes rush-    
 seated chairs in ash wood using       
 traditional styles and methods. The   
 backs are bent in a steam box, the    
 legs and rails turned on a lathe, the 
 seats woven with locally grown rush.  </content>
