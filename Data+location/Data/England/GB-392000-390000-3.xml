		<title>03Interview with a councillor</title>
		<content>     We interviewed a councillor for   
 the conservative party. He likes his  
 job but finds it difficult because he 
 has to earn a living as well as being 
 a councillor.                         
        A typical week in his life     
 would entail working directly with the
 council for three evenings a week and 
 then on Saturday sitting for about two
 hours listening to people's           
 problems.there are less happy sides of
 his job also, like discovering how    
 many lonely people there are.         
        He became a councillor to      
 become more involved in local decision
 making. He put himself forward for the
 council and the public elected him. He
 is a councillor for Lower Bredbury and
 Romiley.He woks long hours,for        
 instance the day before we interviewed
 him he had worked from 3.00p.m.until  
 1.15a.m.                              </content>
