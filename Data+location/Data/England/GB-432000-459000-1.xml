		<title>01Farnham to Brearton</title>
		<content>  An area of undulating landscape,     
 mainly agricultural, with scattered   
 copses, worked-outgravel and sandstone
 quarries, some light industry, and    
 four villages.                        
 FARNHAM is picturesquely grouped      
 around its ancient church. South of   
 the village are flooded gravel pits,  
 now being used for recreation, and an 
 industrial unit. Nearby is the Mires, 
 a Site of Special Scientific Interest.
 LINGERFIELD'S primary school serves   
 the surrounding area. The village is  
 an haphazard collection of houses and 
 offices in a variety of materials.    
 SCOTTON is the largest village; the   
 only one with a shop.                 
 BREARTON has farms situated in the    
 village. New houses are being         
 constructed behind the old buildings.
