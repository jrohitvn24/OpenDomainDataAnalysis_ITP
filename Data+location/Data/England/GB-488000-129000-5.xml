		<title>05NATIONAL TRUST UPKEEP</title>
		<content>   In 1977 the reservoir on Blackdown  
 was enlarged. Bridleways and footpaths
 have to be kept clear of over-hanging 
 branches and open grassland is kept   
 mown. Ditches have to be cleared and  
 bracken destroyed to allow heather to 
 grow. Rhododendrons were cleared in   
 1981. Birches and other young trees   
 are thinned and the lower branches    
 removed from timber trees by brashing 
   The Trust sells timber from the     
 pines and hardwoods which regenerate  
 naturally. In 1979 Scots Pines on     
 Blackdown were thinned; Conservation  
 Volunteers have cleared areas of young
 birch and Pines. There are plantations
 of European and Hybrid Larch and      
 Hemlock on Marley. In 1980, one       
 thousand Norway Sruce were planted at 
 Boarden Door Bottom and 100 Scots     
 pines were felled.
