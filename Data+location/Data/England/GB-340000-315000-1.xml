		<title>01MONTFORD AREA - AN OVERVIEW</title>
		<content> This is a very pleasant and quite     
 secluded part of Shropshire, once you 
 get away from the busy A5, London -   
 Holyhead road which passes through.   
                                       
 The area is almost entirely           
 covered by intensively cultivated     
 farmland, but with fewer farm         
 labourers, most of the residents now  
 commute to the nearby towns for work. 
                                       
 Most of its small population is       
 concentrated in five close-knit       
 communities.  Its inhabitants have to 
 go out of the area for their schooling
 and for most of their shopping and    
 recreational needs.                   
                                       
 Key topics for concern at present are 
 the exact routing of the new          
 Shrewsbury by-pass and the disturbance
 from parachutists at Forton airfield. </content>
