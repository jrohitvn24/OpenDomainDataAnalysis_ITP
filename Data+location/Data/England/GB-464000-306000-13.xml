		<title>13Keyham and Beeby Survey</title>
		<content> A small survey of the residents of    
{Keyham}and{Beeby}was undertaken by    
 children of Class 7 Humberstone Junior
 School during June 1985. The children 
 aimed to find out some information    
 about the residents of the villages.  
 For a{minor purchase}most people      
 travelled to{Scraptoft, Thurmaston}or 
{Leicester. Leicester}was the obvious  
 choice for a{major purchase. Car was  
 the universal method of transport, and
 the{lack of public transport}was      
 mentioned by everyone. It seems that  
 most people in the two villages had   
 moved there from a local village.     
{Peace and quiet,}the{countryside}or a 
{change of job}were the reasons for    
 their move, nevertheless many people  
 felt{isolated.}In their spare time    
 people enjoyed{gardening, walking}and 
{keep-fit.}They were worried about the 
 proposed{Hamilton development.        </content>
