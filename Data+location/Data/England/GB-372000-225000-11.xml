		<title>11Conservation in Newent</title>
		<content>  The character of Newent has changed  
 dramatically in the period since the  
 2nd World War. Several housing        
 estates, both private and council have
 been built and as Newent becomes more 
 residential many older properties have
 been modernised and others demolished 
 and rebuilt.                          
  This steadily increasing change has  
 already meant the loss of some of 'old
 Newent' for ever.                     
               *******                 
  Ever mindful of our local heritage a 
 new organisation{ The Newent Society} 
 was formed in 1985 to protect the     
 environment and to encourage a high   
 standard of architecture and planning 
 and aims to give local people more say
 in the future of the area.            
  To encourage the people of the area  
 to think about their Town, a{'Newent  
{Day'}was organised in September 1985. </content>
