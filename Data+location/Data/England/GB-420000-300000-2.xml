		<title>02 Part of Kettlebrook  Valley</title>
		<content>                                       
 The area studied is 1.5 miles south-  
east of the centre of Tamworth in      
Staffordshire. It is bounded by the    
B5000, the A5(T), Marlborough Way and  
the remains of Glascote Lane.          
 Farmland and old mine workings in the 
valley of Kettlebrook have been        
replaced by planned private and local  
auhority housing, primary and secondary
schools and a park area where shallow  
mining has made building impossible.   
 The B5000 to the north is now a dual  
carriageway serving the Amington       
industrial estate and Marlborough Way  
provides a north-south road link.      
 The names of new developments reflect 
former times. Our school, Dumolo's     
Primary is named after John Dumolo's   
mine and Bird's Bush Primary after     
Bird's Bush Cottage which still stands 
alongside contemporary housing.        </content>
