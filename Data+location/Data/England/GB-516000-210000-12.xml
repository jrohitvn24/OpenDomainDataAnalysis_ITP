		<content> Sandridgebury stables are combined    
 livery stables and a riding school.   
 People with their own horses can keep 
 their animals in the livery stables   
 but have to help in looking after     
 them. The stable girls feed and let   
 out the animals in the morning and the
 owners come every evening to feed,    
 groom and exercise them. There are    
 25 stable liveries and 8 grass        
 liveries. Barnaby is 15 hands and the 
 smallest horse Percy is 11\ hands.    
 The oldest horse is 36 years old and  
 the youngest is 4\ years old. 75% of  
 the riding school pupils are children 
 aged 5 to 16. On sunny days they get  
 100 riders on average. The busiest    
 days are Saturdays and Sundays. The   
 lessons are Â£4.50 per hour and are    
 from 7.30am to 6.00pm.The riding      
 school employs 5 helpers.
