		<title>12TATSFIELD LIGHT RAILWAY.</title>

In 1898 there was a scheme to build    
a branch light railway line from       
Orpington on the South Eastern and     
Chatham Railway out to Tatsfield. A    
Â£light' railway could be built to lower
engineering standards because the speed
of trains was limited to 25 m.p.h.  It 
did not require a special Act of       
Parliament but the scheme had to be    
approved by Commisioners under the     
Light Railways Act of 1896.  The line  
was over seven miles long.  Four       
stations were scheduled; Green Street  
Green, Cudham Valley, Biggin Hill and  
Tatsfield. Biggin Hill Station was     
sited near the Fox and Hounds with a   
level crossing over the Westerham      
Road. The route was confirmed on 10    
June 1902 but the funds were never     
found.                                 </content>
