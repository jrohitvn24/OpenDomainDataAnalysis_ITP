		<title>15STANLEY BURN WALK, PRUDHOE</title>
		<content> Stanley Burn Walk, commonly known as  
 "The Seven Bridges" route, is a most  
 pleasant walk around Prudhoe, rambling
 among a beautiful setting, following  
 the meander of the burn. To reach this
 walk you go past Durham Riding and    
 follow a sign over a field and stile  
 into a wood. You will see a great deal
 of wildlife for instance: fieldmice,  
 rabbits, badgers and owls, and you    
 will see red squirrel dreys.          
 Further along the stream there is a   
 rocky bit of path and a wall of rock  
 known as the " The Grand Canyon".     
 The east branch of the Stanley Burn is
 regarded as the border between Tyne   
 and Wear and Northumberland.
