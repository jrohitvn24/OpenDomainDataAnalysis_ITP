		<content> The only active society in the village
 is the Women's Institute. This was    
 started by Mrs.Ethel Achurch in 1946. 
 The first meeting was held in a room  
 at the Vicarage,with about 20 members.
 4/5 years were spent in a nissen hut  
 in the grounds of the Manor.They then 
 moved to the school.When by public    
 subscription the Village Hall was     
 built in 1958,they moved again.Member 
 -ship is 40 this year (1985) but 3/4  
 of the members come from outside the  
 village.For the past 6 years the      
 Village Hall Committee and the P.C.C. 
 have run an Autumn vegetable show,with
 classes for fruit,vegetables,flowers  
 and cookery.Children's classes are    
 included.Two domino teams and a darts 
 team are run in local leagues by The  
 Green Dragon pub.
