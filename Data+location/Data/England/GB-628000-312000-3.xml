		<content> Rackheath has grown as a{ribbon       
{development}along the Norwich to South
 Walsham road.Housing is mainly small  
 post-war detached bungalows with red  
 pantile roofs.Shopping facilities in  
 the village are rather limited; a     
 small post office/grocery shop,a fish 
 and chip shop and a garage.Fortunately
 Norwich with its excellent shopping   
 facilities is only a few minutes drive
 away.                                 
 The local public house is called the  
 Sole and Heel which may be a link with
 nearby Norwich's past as a centre for 
 the shoe industry.                    
 Although many of the residents of     
 Rackheath commute to Norwich for their
 work, there is some employment locally
 on the new{Rackheath Industrial       
{Estate. }
