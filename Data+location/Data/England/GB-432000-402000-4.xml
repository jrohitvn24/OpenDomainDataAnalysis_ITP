		<content>{Anne Scargill}and other Worsbrough    
 women felt they had to help during the
 Miners' Strike in 1984-85.  Eight     
 weeks into the strike they, with the  
 Barnsley Group, organized a{National  
{Womens' Rally}and 14,000 came.  They  
 provided food for women from the Kent,
 Scottish and Yorkshire Areas.  The    
 women marched from Churchfield to the 
 Civic Hall where there were           
 speakers. After that they picketed    
 alongside the miners and on the third 
 picket 14 Barnsley (and Worsbrough)   
 women were arrested.  In June they    
 began serving{food at the Welfare Hall
 for striking miners and their         
 families.  The strike changed their   
 lives.  Since it ended some have      
 become very active in public affairs. 
 They have spoken before large         
 audiences in this country and abroad, 
 and have appeared on television.      </content>
