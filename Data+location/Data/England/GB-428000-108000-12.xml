		<content> Forests are made of trees and         
 sometimes people do like walking in   
 the forest. Michelle Bisson 8.{Some   
{trees are 100's of years old and one  
{or two are a 1,000.}People might have 
 planted them. Wayne Roper 8.{There are
{so many trees in the forest. Paul     
{Bran 8.}There are some trees that are 
 quite old but not very tall, this is  
 because that every time the tree tries
 to grow the animals come along  and   
 eat off the shoots and the tree cannot
 grow.{When the Forestry Commission    
{plants trees they fence them in to    
{keep the animals out.}Pollarding. This
 is a way of cutting the head out of a 
 tree to produce lots of branches, the 
 head would be cut off six feet high so
 that the animals could not reach the  
 new branches.{Any pollard tree must be
{over 100 years old.}Mature oak trees  
 date from about 1700.M.Bisson  8.     </content>
