		<title>11STAVERTON BY-PASS</title>
		<content>   The village of Staverton is linear, 
 running along the B3105 road. There is
 a narrow, stone bridge on a sharp bend
 where the road crosses the River Avon 
 outside the Nestles Factory.          
   Lots of large lorries use the road. 
 When the school did a traffic survey, 
 we found that most of the lorries were
 passing through the village and not   
 going to the Nestles factory, as we   
 had thought.                          
   Most of the villagers want a by-pass
 but they did not vote for either of   
 the two routes planned by the West    
 Wilts District Council. Instead, they 
 would like the council to consider a  
 by-pass that went straight from the   
 Canal Road Industrial Estate in       
 Trowbridge to Forwards Common and     
 missing the village by half a mile.   
 Meanwhile, people are worried that the
 bridge is unsafe for heavy traffic.   </content>
