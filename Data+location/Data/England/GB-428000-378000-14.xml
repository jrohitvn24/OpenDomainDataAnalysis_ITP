		<title>14THE SHEPLEY SPITFIRE</title>
		<content> At the bottom of Mickley Lane a       
 modern public house displays the sign 
 The{Shepley Spitfire.}At first local  
 consultations failed to find a        
 suitable name for this new pub.       
 However,Mr. Shepley of Woodthorpe     
 Hall wrote to the owners to tell them 
 the reason for his proposed name.     
 During the Second World War,one of the
 Shepley sons  lost his life in action.
 The rest of the family started to     
 raise money to replace this son's     
 Spitfire. The response of the Totley  
 people helped to raise the required   
 amount in a very short time.          
 Now there is this memorial to "One of 
 the few" and the support given to them
 in Totley.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
