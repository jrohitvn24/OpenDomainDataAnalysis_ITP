		<title>14Boxing Day Walk in Ropley</title>
		<content> The Boxing Day Walk was first started 
 11 years ago by Mr J.C.Macinnes as a  
 way of walking off the effect of the  
 Christmas lunch and raising money.The 
 walk,which is along local footpaths,  
 starts and finishes at one of the 3   
 local inns which take it in turn to   
 host the walk.People of all ages are  
 welcome to take part either raising   
 money through sponsorship or just to  
 enjoy the walking.Walkers can start   
 any time from 10-11.30 and we cover   
 about 5 miles. We walk whatever the   
 weather - fine,rain or snow!Over 200  
 people have taken part and many dogs  
 join their owners on the walk.Last    
 year the money raised went to help the
 Parish Hall and one year it was to    
 help buy more handbells.The 1985 walk 
 will start from the Anchor and the    
 proceeds will go to the Village Pond  
 Fund and to the Ropley Girl Guides.   </content>
