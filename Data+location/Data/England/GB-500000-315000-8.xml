		<title>08FARMING: MILK PRODUCTION</title>
		<content> Two Friesian milking herds graze in   
 our area. Both have about 130 animals,
 about 55 to 75 of which are "in milk".
 The rest are "followers" - replacement
 heifers (this year's and last year's  
 calves, plus in-calf heifers).        
  They are either put to the bull or   
 artificially inseminated (by "the bull
 in the bowler hat") at just under two 
 years old, calving at two and three-  
 quarters. Neither farm rears beef, so 
 all steer calves are sold.            
  One farm has an autumn calving so its
 peak milking period is in winter, when
 milk prices are highest. Milk fetches 
 perhaps 12p per litre in summer up to 
 15p or 17p in winter (prices also vary
 with the quality of the milk).        
  Each herd can produce 1,000 to 1,200 
 litres a day. A cow gives 5,000-6,000 
 litres a year, and eats about a tonne 
 of cattle cake, in addition to grass. </content>
