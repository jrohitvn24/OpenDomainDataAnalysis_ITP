		<content> Town meets country in the block as a  
 whole so non-housing landuse not      
 surprisingly takes up between 25 and  
 30 percent of the area.               
 Pasture and arable fields bound the   
 north whilst to the west and north-   
 west very specialised market gardening
 is very dominant. It is interesting to
 look through the "yellow pages" at the
 names of these garden farmers and note
 names like Baarda and Schelingerhout. 
 And locally the greenhouses are known 
 as "dutch lights" - further evidence  
 to confirm the influx from Holland    
 that occurred in the 1920s. There is a
 liberal sprinkling of sportsfields    
 though most are privately owned and   
 even the large school fields with a   
 running track are not officially      
 available to the public. Play parks   
 and a mini golf course seemed to be   
 greatly underused on numerous visits. </content>
