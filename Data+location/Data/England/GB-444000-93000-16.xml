		<title>16GURNARD-A VICTORIAN VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> Gurnard is a Victorian village.These  
 houses were built of brick.Gurnard    
 farm and the old thatched cottage     
 are very much older.They were built   
 of stone.Two small estates,with many  
 bungalows,have been built of imitation
 stone or brick.One was built on a     
 barley field,the other on a holiday   
 camp site.                            
 The new buildings are completely out  
 of character with the rest of the     
 village,both in colour and design.The 
 village is still attractive but there 
 is a litter problem.                  
 Gurnard has a strong community spirit,
 there are many clubs:
