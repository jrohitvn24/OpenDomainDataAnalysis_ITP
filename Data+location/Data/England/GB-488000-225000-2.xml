		<content> Leighton-Linslade was two towns       
 separated by the river Ouzel. Leighton
 derives from "Leactun" (a kitchen     
 garden) and Linslade derives from     
 "Hlincgelad" (a sandy bank by the side
 of a stream). St. Mary's church in Old
 Linslade is Norman in nucleus. It is  
 rarely open to the public. Linslade   
 Manor and the converted water-mill are
 both mentioned in the Domesday Book of
 1068.                                 
 Soulbury overlooks the Ouzel valley   
 and comprises of several half timbered
 and thatched houses around a green and
 an attractive 14th century church.    
 Buildings of note are Lovetts Charity 
 School House built in 1724, Chelmscote
 Manor and Liscombe Manor (large,      
 rambling and built in the 16th        
 century). There are remains of 14th   
 century chapels in both manor grounds.
