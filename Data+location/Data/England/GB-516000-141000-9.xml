		<title>09NEWDIGATE CHURCH</title>
		<content> The ancient church of St.             
 Peter,Newdigate,is a bridge from the  
 past;it's sole purpose is to witness  
 to revelation of the Living God       
 through Jesus Christ.The same faith   
 that inspired its builders enlightens 
 true worshippers today.The ancient    
 shell remains intactbut the inside has
 been altered many times as            
 ecclesiastical fashions changed.The   
 present century has witnessed changes 
 in services and modes of presentation.
   The reason for this is that we at   
 St.Peter's Church,endeavour to        
 practice the priesthood of all        
 believers,allowing various spiritual  
 gifts to be used for the benefit of   
 all.                                  
   There is a lively spirit in the     
 services,varying,which provides a     
 richness that is denied by repetition 
 of the same thing week by week.       </content>
