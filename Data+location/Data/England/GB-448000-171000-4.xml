		<title>04A POPULAR LEISURE ACTIVITY</title>
		<content> In the whole of our class of 26, 10 of
 us go horse riding. This is because   
 there are riding stables in Curridge, 
 and we have some lovely countryside,  
 to ride in. It costs Â£5 for a lesson  
 and Â£4 for an hour. You can have a day
 ride for Â£14. Full livery is when you 
 have your own pony at the stables and 
 nobody else can ride it. This costs   
 Â£800 per year, or you can have it on  
 half livery at half the cost. When the
 summer comes the owner cuts the       
 ponies' manes and tails so they don't 
 get too hot. The horses are re-shod   
 every six months. The old shoes are   
 often given to people who think it is 
 lucky. it is fun riding because you   
 can see everything, but sometimes you 
 get a sore bottom.
