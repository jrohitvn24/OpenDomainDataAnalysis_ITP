		<content>   When the children come in from      
 school they watch television while the
 meal is cooking. We then have our meal
 (I have to put my husband's in the    
 oven as he is not usually home) and   
 then the children do their piano or   
 flute practice and anything else they 
 have to do for school or any other    
 club they belong to.                  
   My children share a large bedroom   
 and they start to get ready for bed at
 about 7.30 and 7.45p.m.               
   When my husband comes home from work
 he has his dinner and either does some
 more office work or relaxes by reading
 watching television,listening to      
 records or the radio. He then feeds   
 the animals at about 10.p.m. and we go
 to bed between 10.30 and 11.30.       
   I switch my automatic washing       
 machine before I go to bed so that the
 washing is ready to hang out next day.</content>
