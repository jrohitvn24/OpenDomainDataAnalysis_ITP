		<title>20EVENTS IN WOODLAND</title>
		<content>  Just after Easter the juniors from   
 our school went on a visit to{London. 
 We went with two other schools on a 3 
 day visit.The visit was brilliant and 
 was very interesting.                 
       {THE STREETS OF LONDON          
  London was noisy and packed with     
  people,                              
  The traffic it was busy.             
  The smell was from the fumes and gas,
  All this made me dizzy.              
                                       
  The streets are hard,the grass is    
  soft,                                
  Like the softest bed on earth.       
  The River Thames flows silently,     
  Past H.M.S. Belfast's berth.         
                                       
 We found the{History and Science      
{Museums}the most interesting places we
 went to.There was lots to do in{London
 but I wouldn't like to live there.    </content>
