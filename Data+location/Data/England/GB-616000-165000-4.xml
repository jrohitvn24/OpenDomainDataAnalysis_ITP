		<content>  49% OF OUR AREA IS FARMLAND. THE     
 CROPS WHICH TAKE UP THE MOST SPACE ARE
 THE CEREALS AND THE OILSEED RAPE. THE 
 TYPES OF CEREAL ARE BARLEY AND WHEAT  
 (YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE  
 BARLEY DROOPS). THERE IS ONLY A SMALL 
 AMOUNT OF PIG, BEEF AND POULTRY       
 PRODUCTION.  THE ONLY KIND OF POULTRY 
 ARE CHICKENS. THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF 
 FRUIT GROWING (APPLES, PEARS).        
  THERE IS SOME MARKET GARDENING       
  (LETTUCES, BEETROOT,                 
 ONIONS,BROCOLLI, CABBAGE AND RUNNER   
 BEANS). THE AREA COVERED BY HAYFIELDS,
 POULTRY AND PIG PRODUCTION ETC.IS VERY
 SMALL.                                
                                       
                                       
  THE DAIRY CATTLE IN THE AREA ARE     
 FRESIAN AND JERSEY AND THERE IS A     
 SMALL AMOUNT OF GRASSLAND.
