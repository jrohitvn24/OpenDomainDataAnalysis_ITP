		<title>02LOCAL HISTORY OF SHALBOURNE</title>
		<content> It has had many names in the past, but
 in the{Domesday Book}it was called    
{Scaldeburn.}The most likely derivation
 of the name is from its shallow brook 
 which is still in existance. There are
 several houses of historical interest,
 some recently altered, but only three 
 are graded 1 or 2:{The Grove}which was
 a Queen Anne farmhouse and{The Manor  
 and its large barn. At{Bedwyn Brail}an
 excavation of a large{Roman villa,    
{mentioned in the}Domesday Books, has  
 been taking place over past years,    
 latterly by experts and students from 
{Ruttger's University, Indiana.}In the 
 past it has been robbed (its stones   
 contributed to Bedwyn church) but is  
 now covered by tarpaulins and earth   
 each winter and uncovered before work 
 begins in Spring.  All articles of    
 interest are catalogued, cleaned and  
 sent to{Devizes Museum.               </content>
