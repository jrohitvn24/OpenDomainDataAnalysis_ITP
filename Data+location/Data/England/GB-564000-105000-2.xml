		<title>02The Norman landing in Sussex</title>
		<content>{William the Conqueror}landed at{      
{Pevensey}in 1066. When we looked at   
 our area, just east of the landing    
 site, it is easy to see why this was  
 so popular. Although it would have    
 been even more marshy in those days,  
 it would still have been an easier    
 landing than several other points     
 along the coast. Once there{William}  
 could secure his campaign. We found   
 that this area of the{Levels}has      
 always been considered vulnerable to  
 enemy attack. We found evidence of    
 defensive work from other wars. We    
 also found the sites of several       
 saltworks or{salt-pans}where sea water
 was trapped in shallow basins and had 
 evaporated. This was a very important 
 industry as it was the only way in    
 early times to preserve meat and fish 
 during the winter.
