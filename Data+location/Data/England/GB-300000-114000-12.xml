		<title>12TOUR OF THE VILLAGE 2 cont.</title>
		<content> Many of the oldest houses have been   
 demolished. On the site of a Ghost    
 house there is a store.               
 Opposite the Post Office there is our 
 Primary School. The road divides here 
 going on and round to the right past  
 the church and the Rectory, meeting   
 up with the first tour at Sampford    
 Bridge; or left towards Boobery an old
 road with very old cottages at the    
 beginning and more modern houses along
 the way. About half way along Boobery 
 the Brendon estate sits on the site of
 an old market garden.                 
 Past the Brendons and Boobery, and off
 towards the Canal, Beaufort Close,    
 which leads to Richmond Close, provide
 Council houses.                       
 At the end Boobery joins up with      
 Whitnage Road. To the left, almost    
 opposite, is a lane that takes you to 
 the old{LIME KILNS.}                  </content>
