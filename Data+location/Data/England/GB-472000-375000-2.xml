		<title>02FARMING ON GLEBE FARM</title>
		<content>{ }A local farmer who rented 199 acres 
 of land from the Church Commissioners 
 owns 40 bullocks. He also owns 30 hens
 which he breeds for eggs, but he is   
 mainly agricultural.In this area the  
 ground is made of clay. He is very pro
 conservation and thinks too many      
 hedges and trees have been removed.   
 There is not much pollution.He is     
 quite mechanised therefore only       
 needing the help of 1 man.            
 Occasionally there is poaching in this
 area, especially at night.            
  The lorries are getting larger and   
 also more efficient. The fields are   
 large and because of the highcost of  
 fertilzers it is necessary to keep    
 most of the excess straw for use on   
 the farm.                             
  There is no great erosion and no     
 effect from so called acid rain.
