		<content> I wake up at 7.30 am and get dressed.I
 get on the school bus at about 8.22.  
 I get  to school at roughly 8.50 am.  
 Then it's the usual boring day at     
 school,consisting of 8 lessons and 3  
 breaks.I get home at 4.50 pm and feed 
 my pets.Then I watch television and do
 as much homework as I feel like or as 
 much as I've got time for,which is    
 usually quite a lot because there's   
 nothing to do in our village. I go to 
 a youth club 3 miles away once a week.
 I go to bed quite early if there's    
 nothing on telly,otherwise I go to a  
 friend's house to watch a video.In my 
 eyes it's a fairly boring day.
