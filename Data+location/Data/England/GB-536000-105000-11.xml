		<title>11WOODINGDEAN HOMES AND HOUSES</title>
		<content> Woodingdean has been a residential    
 part of Brighton for about fifty      
 years.The earliest homes were built in
 the 1930's.These are bungalows,chalets
 and detached houses to the North.In   
 the 1950's and 60's a large council   
 estate was built to the South and East
 of the original building.This consists
 of brick built houses in blocks of    
 four.During the 1970's detached       
 private houses were constructed.All   
 the houses have gardens and the newest
 ones, garages.Present prices range    
 from Â£23,250 for a 2 bedroom terraced 
 house to Â£77,500 for a detached 4     
 bedroom one.                          
     Very little building is now taking
 place in the area and as a result,    
 generally, the residents of           
 Woodingdean are older,resulting in    
 falling roles in schools and an       
 increase of pensioners.               </content>
