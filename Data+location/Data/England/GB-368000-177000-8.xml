		<title>08YE OLDE INNE,WESTERLEIGH.</title>
		<content>{ Ye Olde Inne (15th century)}was the  
 original house for workers who built  
 the nearby church.Two{passages,}now   
 blocked off, lead from the cellar to  
 the church and old friary.Several     
 hundred people use the pub at         
 weekends, but fewer on other          
 days.{Regular visitors}mostly live    
 locally but others come from          
 Yate,Chipping Sodbury and Bristol.    
  The present{landlord}has lived there 
 for ten years.He enjoys it because it 
 is more a{way of family life}than just
 a job .He starts work each day at     
 7.30a.m. by doing the accounts. Then  
 he cleans the bars and cellar making  
 sure that all the barrels are correct 
 for when customers arrive. During the 
 afternoon he potters outside, keeping 
 the gardens tidy.Children can play    
 outside or stay in the{family room.
