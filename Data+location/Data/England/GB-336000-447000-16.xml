		<content>  Reuban Bishop was born and lived in  
 Macclesfield before the First World   
 War.He grew up with Charles           
 Tunnicliffe famous for his paintings  
 of birds.He now lives at Windy Ridge,a
 semi-detached cottage,on the old shore
 road between Pilling Land and Pilling 
 (03800496). Mr Bishop believes in     
 being as self-sufficient as           
 possible.To this end he has designed  
 and built his own wind generator,which
 is a landmark for any walker down our 
 sea wall.He is the only person,as far 
 as we know,who operates his own       
 methane gas plant,this based on a     
 design of Ram Bux Sing.He does most of
 his cooking with the gas but intends  
 to convert his car to use it too.We   
 think that Mr Reuben Bishop is a man  
 born before his time and soon we will 
 have to turn to production of methane 
 and to wind generation of electricity.</content>
