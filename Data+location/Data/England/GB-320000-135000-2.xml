 churchyard surrounded by ancient yew  
 trees. Nothing is known of the        
 founding of the church,but there is S

 stonework in the north wall denoting a
 church built in the 10th century.

 would have been as big as the present 
 Nave,with a much smaller Chancel.

 century,the south aisle and chapel    
 were added a hundred years later. The{

   The first pews added about          
 1536.During the 18th century the wagon
 roof was plastered in and the         
 chancel remodelled.  T HE church

 ends. The tools of the trade for
