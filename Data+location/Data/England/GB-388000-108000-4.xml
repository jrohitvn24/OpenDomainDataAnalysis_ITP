		<title>04Recreation in Pimperne.</title>
		<content> From our survey we saw that over half 
 of those who replied took some sort of
 exercise or recreation.Some played    
 major games like football,cricket,    
 rugby or golf.Some played badminton,  
 squash or went swimming.A few went    
 horse riding,fishing,gliding,dancing. 
 Nearly all had to go out of Pimperne, 
 to Blandford or further,to take part. 
 Some kept fit by jogging or going to  
 keep fit classes or gardening.Many    
 walked to keep fit and to enjoy the   
 country side.Just over a third went to
 the theatre occasionally,many more    
 would like to have gone but found the 
 journey to Bournemouth,Poole or       
 Salisbury and the price of theatre    
 tickets too expensive.About half the  
 people who answered read alot.About   
 the same number watch a lot of        
 television.
