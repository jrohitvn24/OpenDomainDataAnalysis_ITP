		<content>     Many events take place in and     
around the village hall.One of them is 
the playscheme which provides          
entertainment for young children during
the school holidays.An afternoon       
enjoying many activities like painting,
pottery,and badge making is provided   
for just a small sum of money.         
     Jumble sales are also very popular
in the village hall.They usually last  
for the whole day raising a large sum  
of money for charity.While the jumble  
sale takes place you can have your car 
washed for 60p in the car park.        
     When a car boot sale takes place  
you can have your own stall for twenty 
pounds.All the profit goes to the      
charity of your own choice.            
     The village hall can also be      
rented for parties or clubs.At one     
stage these were very popular.
