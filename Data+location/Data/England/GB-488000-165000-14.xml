		<title>14SWINLEY PARK SAWMILL-WORKERS</title>
		<content>   The{Sawmill}employs 25 full-time    
 workers.  Eleven men work in the mill 
 itself and the rest work in the       
{forests.} There are seven woodmen who 
 cut down the trees and the others     
 check the trees for disease, maintain 
 the fire rides, clear the ditches and 
 thin the trees.                       
                                       
   The{employees}who were interviewed  
 said that they enjoyed working in the 
 open air and had the advantage of low 
 rent cottages on the estate and low   
 cost firewood.  The disadvantages were
 that the wages were not very high and 
 the foresters were on duty at the     
 weekends.  One employee said that he  
 had been employed on the{Crown Estates
 for 39 years, the last two years at   
 the Sawmill.  He worked a 39 hour     
 week, from 7.00 a.m. until 5.30 p.m.
