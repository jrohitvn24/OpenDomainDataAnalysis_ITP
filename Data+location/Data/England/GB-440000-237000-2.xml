		<title>02Crouch Hill :Banbury</title>
		<content>Crouch Hill is the {highest point in   
the Banbury district}. It is now used  
for crops except for rough grass and   
bushes at the top. During World War II 
they used Crouch Hill as an {air raid  
lookout post}. In 400 BC there was a   
{British settlement}. There is no      
evidence that the Romans settled in    
Banbury because there are no coins or  
anything to prove it. The hill is      
very popular with children because     
they like sledging there in the        
winter. There is a public footpath     
that goes down the hill. The shape of  
the  is a hill kind of dome shape.     
Every Christmas, the {Scouts walk 40   
miles} and go to the top where there   
is a {bench mark}.
