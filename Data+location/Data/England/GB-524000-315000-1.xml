      This flat fenland area, only just
 above sea level, is mainly            
 intensely farmed agriciltural         
 land. The market town of Spalding     
 lies 5 kilometers to the              
 the North West.                       
      Part of the village of Cowbit,   
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Book,is included in our designated    
 area. The church, the school and the  
 village hall are adjacent to one      
 another. Five interconnecting roads   
 flanked by bungalows, detached and    
 semidetached houses form homes for the
 138 families living in the main part  
 of the village..                      
      The children carried out house to
 house surveys and collected           
 information about the people living in
 the area.
