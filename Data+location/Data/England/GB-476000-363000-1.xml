		<content> FARMING                               
    The main industry  in and around   
 Sutton on Trent is farming. The main  
 type of farming is arable. The average
 size of a farm in this area is 300    
 acres.                                
        Mr.Andrew Parsons has a 170    
 acre farm. The Parsons family have    
 farmed in Sutton for 100 years. The   
 farm is mixed, arable and beef        
 cattle.Government subsidies and taxes 
 and market prices affect Mr. Parsons's
 farming. He takes his produce to      
 Newark market himself on Wednesday    
 mornings.                             
          Mr. Parsons would like       
 farmers to be more concerned with     
 conservation. He would like plant and 
 animal life to be preserved for future
 generations.He is interested in the   
 history of the village.
