		<title>11Hoole Tennis Club(1)</title>
		<content>   Hoole Tennis Club was formed over   
thirty years ago.When it started it    
had just one team in the Southport     
District League. Now it fields two     
teams in that league and another in    
the South Ribble League.               
  The area that the club covers is     
limited to three courts because the    
land it is situated on and the         
neighbouring bowling club are owned by 
the village.                           
  Nowadays the club has about a hundred
and twenty members including juniors.  
Each year the senior members arrange   
coaching for the juniors.The courses   
last up to ten weeks. In September     
there is a junior competition arranged 
in age groups from Under 13 to Under   
15. Members range in ages from seven   
to over sixty. Membership costs five   
pounds per year and each lesson costs  
fifty pence.(Contd.)                   </content>
