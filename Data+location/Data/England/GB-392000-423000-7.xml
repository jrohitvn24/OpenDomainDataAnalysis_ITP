		<title>07The Todmorden Flood of 1982</title>
		<content>{An eye-witness account by Jon Wilson, 
{Robin Wood Junior School.             
   My house was badly flooded in the   
 disastrous flood of 1982.A thunder    
 storm broke at 4.00pm and by 4.15pm   
 the road was a river and water poured 
 into the house.                       
   I helped my mum take things upstairs
 and looked through the bedroom window.
 I saw a car and dustbins floating down
 the road.                             
   Alot of mud was left behind;the road
 was chewed up and a house collasped   
 with the strength of the water.T.V.   
 cameras recorded the damage.          
   People in Cornholme helped one      
 another, to clean their houses, till  
 very late at night and we had to live 
 with my grandma for 3 months.         
   The culverts, under the houses, have
 been cleaned out and repaired to stop 
 it ever happening again.              </content>
