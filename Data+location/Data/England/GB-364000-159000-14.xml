		<content>{THE LATEST FASHIONS.                  
   The Teenagers all liked them a      
 lot,and children nearly as much.The   
 adults had mixed feelings about them. 
{CLOTHES.                              
    We found that the adults preferred 
 skirts to trousers or dresses.        
 Teenagers,however,showed a great      
 preference for trousers,whilst the    
 children liked skirts.Dresses seemed  
 to be generally unpopular.            
{MAKE-UP.                              
  The children liked to wear this most 
 of all.This was probably because it is
 not allowed,usually,unless for        
 dressing up.All groups liked          
 blusher,and mascara was especially    
 popular with adults.Eye-shadow was    
 preferred by the young.Powder was     
 the least popular make-up,but lipstick
 was the favourite.{(Continued)
