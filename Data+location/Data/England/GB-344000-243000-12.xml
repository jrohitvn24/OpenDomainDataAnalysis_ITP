		<title>12CHILDREN'S HOPES FOR FUTURE</title>
		<content>   IN THE FUTURE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE   
 MORE JOBS.THE JOB SITUATION IS BAD. I 
 DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN I LEAVE     
 SCHOOL.PERHAPS JOURNALISM.            
   I HOPE THERE WILL BE LESS VIOLENCE  
 IN THE WORLD. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED 
 AT FOOTBALL MATCHES BY OTHER PEOPLE   
 GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.               
   PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN ETHIOPIA ARE  
 STARVING BECAUSE OF DROUGHT. THE REST 
 OF THE WORLD HAS BEEN RAISING MILLIONS
 OF POUNDS FOR THEM BUT IT STILL IS NOT
 ENOUGH. IT WOULD BE A BETTER WORLD    
 WITH PLENTY OF FOOD.                  
   WAR IS HORRIBLE SO ALL THE COUNTRIES
 SHOULD AGREE ON NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT   
 AND TROUBLE WITH GROUPS LIKE THE IRA  
 SHOULD BE SOLVED.MORE PEACE WOULD BE  
 NICE.                                 
   I HOPE THERE WILL BE A CURE FOR     
 CANCER, A HORRIBLE DISEASE.YOU CAN DIE
 FROM ALL SORTS OF CANCER AFFECTING YOU</content>
