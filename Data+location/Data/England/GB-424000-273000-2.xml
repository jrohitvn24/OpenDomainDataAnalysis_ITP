		<title>02WATER TOWER</title>
		<content>{The water tower in CROMWELL LANE} can 
 be seen from miles around.It is known 
 as the Tile Hill Water Tower and was  
 built in 1932.It is 24m high and holds
 13,060m3 of water in a single         
 compartment.The tower is of vein      
 forced concrete, standing on columns, 
 between which are concrete walls with 
 windows. access to the tank and roof  
 is by a spiral staircase which passes 
 in a tube through the centre of the   
 tank. The tower is used to serve the  
 local area with water,but its main use
 is to hold water at a high level      
 (above the roofs of the houses) so    
 that there is a good "head" of water  
 flowing in the pipes serving Coventry.
