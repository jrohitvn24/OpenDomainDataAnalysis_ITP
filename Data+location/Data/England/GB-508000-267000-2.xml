		<title>02Kimbolton Castle</title>
		<content>    The castle has stood on the present
 site since {Geoffrey Fitzpiers}       
 abandoned the original one,half a mile
 to the south west, in about 1200.     
 It has undergone a series of rebuilds 
 the most important of which was to the
 designs of {Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor}   
 between 1707 and 1719.   At the same  
 time the Venetian painter{Pellegrini} 
 provided murals over the grand        
 staircase and in the chapel.          
    The last major renovation left the 
 castle much as it stands today : a    
 fortified manor house has evolved into
 a C18 stately home, and finally been  
 sympathetially adapted into a school. 
    The Manchesters' motto             
      {DISPONENDO NON MUTANDO ME}      
 is inscribed on a stone crest over the
 courtyard and has multiple ironies.
