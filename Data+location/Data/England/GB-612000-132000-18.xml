		<title>18Cade Cottage</title>
		<content>  {Cade Cottage}was built in the 15th  
 century but from 1075 had been a      
 small shepherds hut. It was mentioned 
 in the original Domesday Book. It is  
 situated next to Palmarsh's Oakstead  
 Petrol Station on Dymchurch Road. In  
 1963 the house was in danger of being 
 knocked down. The cottage's kitchen is
 built over the place where the old    
 shepherd's hut once stood. When Mr and
 Mrs Joyce moved in the house had to be
 practically rebuilt. Under the kitchen
 is a tunnel which{Jack Cade,}the      
 famous Kentish rebel, used to get to  
 an old bridle path which is now the   
 path down to the quarry. The cottage  
 has 9 rooms, 3 bedrooms upstairs, all 
 of which have curtains instead  of    
 doors. Downstairs has 1 bedroom, a    
 kitchen, a sitting room, a dining     
 room, a toilet and a music room. Four 
 of the rooms have doors.              </content>
