		<title>14RELIGION. S CREAKE</title>
		<content> The only surviving church in the      
 village is the Church of England's St 
 Mary's.  The Congregational Church,   
 and the Primitive Methodist Chapel    
 have closed.  Roman Catholic and      
 Methodist services are held in        
 Fakenham and Burnham Market.  Recent  
 Church of England policy of allocating
 its total available clergy on a       
 Diocesan bases, has meant that the    
 number of priests in Norfolk is much  
 less than the number of parishes.     
 The Vica of S Creake is also the      
 Priest-in-charge of five other        
 parishes.  This presents him with     
 many problems.  Apart from travelling 
 over many miles, over minor roads, in 
 winter, he has to adapt to variations 
 in the order of service, from one     
 parish to the next.                   
 For example; S Creake has a high      
 church service and N Creake a low one.</content>
