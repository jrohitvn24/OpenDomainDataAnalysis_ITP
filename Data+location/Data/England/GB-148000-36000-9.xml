		<title>09VILLAGE LIFE IN HALSETOWN.</title>
		<content>  The people we spoke to in Halsetown  
 enjoy their{life style.}Halsetown is  
 quiet, the atmosphere relaxed, and    
 the lay-out of the village ensures    
 privacy.                              
  Halsetown boasts a genuine, old-style
{village store,}where pen-knives,      
 picture-postcards, batteries and      
 sun-oil vie for position with all the 
 usual groceries. Self-selection and   
 the check out till have been firmly   
 resisted, and proprietor Willy Dunn   
 finds time for a chat as he dispenses 
 life's necessities.                   
  Born in the village 62 years ago,    
 Willy is something of a{local         
{character.}His parents moved into the 
 house on the cross-roads 60 years ago 
 and converted it to a shop. According 
 to Willy the character of the village 
 is less friendly. Newcomers have      
 renovated derelict cottages.          </content>
