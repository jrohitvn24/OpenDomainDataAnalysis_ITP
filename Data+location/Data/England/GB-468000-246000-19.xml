		<content>    A church was probably built on this
 ground in{920 A.D.,}but most of the   
 present building,{ST. LAWRENCE,}dates 
 from about{1230-1330.}                
    It was built of Northamptonshire   
{ironstone}and has had several         
 alterations inside. In the{South Aisle
 of the church, is the{CADAVER MONUMENT
 to the former rector - the{Archdeacon 
{WILLIAM SPONNE. }The East window      
 celebrates Queen Victoria's Diamond   
 Jubilee and the West window was       
 dedicated in 1982 to Emily, the wife  
 of Bertrand Moren M.B.E.  The oldest  
 of the{6 bells}in the{Tower}dates to  
 1612 and during restoration work, the 
 remains of a{Roman pavement}were      
 discovered under the floor.           
    Other churches in Towcester include
 the{Roman Catholic Church(1845),}the  
{Baptist Chapel(1877)}and the{Methodist
{Chapel (1893).                        </content>
