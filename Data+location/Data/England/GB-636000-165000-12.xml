		<title>12LEISURE IN RAMSGATE</title>
		<content> During the day people can swim in the 
 sea or indoor pool,play in the park or
 on the amusements.At night there are  
 pubs,social and night clubs and       
 restaurants.During the summer, trains 
 and coaches bring holiday makers from 
 places like London for the sun and    
 sea.The 4 main parks in Ramsgate have 
 swings and climbing frames and most   
 are ideal for walking about to enjoy  
 the fresh air.Some offer tennis and   
 bowls for a small fee.The coast by the
 marina is popular with walkers and    
 fishermen.The marina swimming pool was
 closed down as it was too expensive to
 keep in good repair and has been      
 filled in scarring the landscape! Pubs
 like Kent's in King street have been  
 "jazzed up" to look modern and play   
 loud music whilst others attract      
 people wanting a quiet drink and chat.
 The cinema runs 2 screens at a time.  </content>
