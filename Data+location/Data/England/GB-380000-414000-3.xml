		<content>   One event which has been held in    
 Deeply Vale for 8 years has been a pop
 festival. This has attracted up to    
 20,000 people. The festival is held   
 duing the summer so that the people   
 who come to it can camp in this scenic
 area.                                 
   Like many pop festivals many of the 
 local residents object to it taking   
 place.                                
   Around Ashworth Reservoir are many  
 abandoned stone quarries. Some have   
 become filled with water. The area    
 around them is boggy.                 
   Many of the buildings in the area   
 are occupied by quite wealthy         
 commuters from the surrounding towns  
 and old people.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
