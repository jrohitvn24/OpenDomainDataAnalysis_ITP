		<title>07RIVER ESK THROUGH RAVENGLASS</title>
		<content> The river Esk rises from the "Knotts  
 of Tongue",2400 feet above sea level, 
 and is fed by many tributary streams  
 on its 20 mile journey to the sea at  
 Ravenglass,where it joins the rivers  
 Irt and Mite in a unique multiple     
 estuary.The largest of the tributary  
 streams are the Whillan Beck,which    
 takes the outflow from Burnmoor Tarn, 
 and Lincove Beck,which drains Long Top
 and Birker Fell. The Esk is a typical 
 spate river,and the level can rise by 
 several feet an hour when heavy rains 
 on the fells produce flood conditions.
 The river was once famous for its runs
 of sea trout (and to a lesser extent  
 salmon),but catches have been poor in 
 recent years and at present there is a
 voluntary embargo on fishing.The cause
 of the decrease in the migratory fish 
 population is under investigation by  
 the North West Water Authority.       </content>
