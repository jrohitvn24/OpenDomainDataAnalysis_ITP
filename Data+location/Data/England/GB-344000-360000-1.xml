		<title>01SW.Cheshire near Saighton.</title>
		<content> This lowland, rural area,dotted with  
 ponds,is south-east of Chester.The    
 village of Saighton in its N.W. corner
 is 4 miles from Chester.It is largely 
 a pleasant,quiet, agricultural area   
 with grassland for dairy cattle but   
 there is also some production of other
 crops.About a third of the land is    
 owned by Gerald Grosvenor,6th Duke of 
 Westminster,with Lord Woolley and his 
 family having another sixth.          
 The settlement generally is in the    
 form of scattered farmhouses but a    
 line of settlement does follow the    
 route of the A 41(T) road,which nearly
 bissects the area and there is also   
 the concentration in Saighton.Many    
 buildings are 19th century &amp; some are 
 listed. Various small businesses are  
 dispersed throughout the area and not 
 all of them are connected with        
 agriculture.                          </content>
