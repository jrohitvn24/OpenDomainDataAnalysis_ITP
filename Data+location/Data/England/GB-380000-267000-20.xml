		<title>20The River Severn - Pollution</title>
		<content> by Ann Hill                           
 1963 saw the last major flooding of   
 the River Severn at Stourport, since  
 then  the increased use  of dams built
 high up in the headwater areas have   
 allowed man to control the river to   
 some degree.An increase in motor boats
 and pleasure craft using this stretch 
 of the Severn has resulted in many    
 more moorings being used.The constant 
 wash set up by increased boat traffic 
 erodes the banks and muddies the once 
 clear water leading to a loss of weed 
 growth due to a lack of light and a   
 subsiquent loss of habitat for        
 millions of small water creatures. Oil
 and petrol spillages now often        
 discolour the surface of the river in 
 Summer and the engine noise of boats  
 destroys the country sounds in the    
 once peaceful country areas on this   
 stretch of river below the town.      </content>
