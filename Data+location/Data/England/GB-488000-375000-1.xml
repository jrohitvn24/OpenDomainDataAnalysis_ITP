		<title>01Ecology of Saxilby Area</title>
		<content> This block is rural in situation. Land
 cover  is  chiefly arable, most of the
 houses     and     amenities     being
 concentrated  in Saxilby-with-Ingleby.
 This village is bounded on  the  south
 by  the  A57  trunk  road only 25 feet
 above sea level.  The  land  rises  to
 approximately  60 feet above sea level
 near the church and falls away to both
 east and west to the  River  Till  and
 accomodation  drains respectively. The
 soil consists of a somewhat heavy  but
 fertile  loam overlying a clay subsoil
 which is well drained  to  appropriate
 ditches   and   dykes.   Broxholme  is
 divided from Saxilby by the River Till
 about 25 feet  above  sea  level,  the
 land rising to about 40 feet above sea
 level  on the north/south road through
 the hamlet. The soil is heavy clay and
 loam over well drained subsoil.
