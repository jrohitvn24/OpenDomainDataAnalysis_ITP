 A seemingly unlikely place to attract 
 tourists, Stanford Bridge is in fact a
 very popular place during the summer, 
 with a site for touring caravans as   
 well as a site with 28 residential    
 caravans.   Most of these static      
 caravans are owned by people from the 
 West Midlands who come to Stanford to 
 enjoy the peace and quiet and also the
 fishing in the adjacent river Teme,   
 where competitions are held most weeks
 during the season.                    
                                       
 Also, the Hill Climb at nearby        
{Shelsley Walsh}brings an influx of    
 caravanners to make use of the        
 facilities of shops, showers and      
 toilets available on the tourer site.
