		<content> This block surrounding Stoke Village  
 is largely agricultural. It is over_  
 shadowed by Kingsnorth and Grain power
 stations and the storage tanks of a   
 former oil refinery at Grain.  Large  
 employment in the construction        
 industry has now ceased since the     
 completion of the power stations and  
 local employment now consists of      
 maintenance duties only.  Many are    
 unemployed. Demolition of the refinery
 is almost complete.  Agriculture gives
 temporary employment to women, cutting
 and packing cash crops.  Quarrying for
 gravel between Hoppers Lane and       
 Ratcliffe Highway provides a          
 controversial bed for dumping waste.  
 Pockets of housing development by a   
 local builder has enhanced odd corners
 of the village.  Travel to Chatham is 
 expensive with bus fares at Â£2.40     
 return.                               </content>
