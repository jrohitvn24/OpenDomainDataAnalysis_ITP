      The O.S. map of 1883  does not   
 mark the village of Delabole but shows
 the three  hamlets of{Pengelly,       
{Meadrose}and{Rockhead,}whose names    
 live on as street names.              
      In 1893 the{railway}came to North
 Cornwall. It was built alongside and  
 the station took its name from the    
{Delabole Slate Quarry.}The three      
 original hamlets, linked by Victorian 
 ribbon building along the main road,  
 also took the name of Delabole and the
 village is named as such on the O.S.  
 map of 1907.                          
     {Delabole Station}only lated for  
 70 years. By orders of Dr. Beeching,  
 the railway was closed in 1963 and the
 station building is now a private     
 house.
