		<content>{A day in the life  of Peter aged 9.}  
   Every day I get up at  7am. I go    
 down stairs and go out side . At 8am. 
 I feed my poultry  and give them      
 water. Then I have to see that my     
 budgies have some seed and water,     
 then, if I feel like eating, I go back
 in the house and have my breakfast.   
    After breakfast I clean my teeth   
 and get ready for school.Before I go  
 to school I sometimes have to let     
 Fred, my pony, out of his stable into 
 the field.                            
    After school I return home to      
 do all my jobs again and collect my   
 eggs.Then I shut all the hens up for  
 the night.Sometimes I watch TV or     
 stay outside,then I go to see nan and 
 grandad who live nearby.Then home to  
 bed at 9.00pm.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
