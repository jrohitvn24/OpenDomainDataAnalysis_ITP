		<title>12TREMORE SCHOOL (PRIVATE)</title>
		<content> 1Tremore School is a private school - 
 that is, it is not owned by the       
 Authority and the parents pay Â£8 a    
 week per child. The teachers are not  
 trained like our teachers and neither 
 do they have classes like ours. The   
 children sit in one big room, always  
 working from set books. They have     
 desks with wooden cubicles around     
 them.They have to wave a union jack if
 they want the teacher's attention.They
 are not allowed to talk unless the    
 teacher wants them to.They are given a
 de-merit mark if they stand up.There  
 are no school dinners so the children 
 bring packed lunches.They do not have 
 a television, a video or musical      
 instruments.All their books are sent  
 from a Christian centre in America.   
 There is a test in every book. If the 
 results are not good enough the child 
 has to do all the book again.         </content>
