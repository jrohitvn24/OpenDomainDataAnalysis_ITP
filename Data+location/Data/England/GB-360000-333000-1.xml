		<content> Moreton Say gets the first part of its
 name from the low lying marshy land   
 known as Smythemoor-the'tun'(farmstead
 on the moor and the second part is a  
 legacy of the lordship of the De Saye 
 family,from the 12th to the 14th      
 century.The Drumble got its name      
 because it was a prominent place for  
 swarms of bees.It is locally believed 
 that Audley Brow was named after Lord 
 Audley who fought a battle there.     
  Robert Clive who was born at nearby  
 Styche Hall,was christened and buried 
 at Moreton Say Church.                
  In the centre of the village are the 
 Church,the Rectory,the school,the     
 school house,the Clive Memorial Church
 House,six council houses,one farm,two 
 bungalows,three cottages and one      
 private house.All around are scattered
 farms and rolling countryside.There   
 are 4 council houses at Moreton Wood. </content>
