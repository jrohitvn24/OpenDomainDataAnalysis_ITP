{  The school}used to be next to       
 Berwick Church but moved to its       
 present building in 1937.             
   In 1975 there was a change in this  
 area to the 3-tier educational system 
 of First, Middle and Upper schools, so
 leaving Berwick with the 5-9 year     
 olds.  Closure of the school was      
 feared.                               
   In 1977 an {Outdoor Pursuits Centre}
 was opened at the school.  Camping    
 equipment is provided and other       
 Wiltshire schools camp at the site    
 throughout the summer months.         
   This has the dual advantage of      
 enabling the school to remain open and
 letting the children meet others of   
 their own age as we are normally a    
 tiny, rather isolated community.
