		<content> It is an area of{housing}and also an  
 area of{woodland.}It is a quiet place 
 to live and very clean. You can get to
 Lawrence Weston and Kingsweston       
 through the woods. Through the woods  
 there is a{stream}which is very       
 popular with children because they    
 catch little fish and paddle in the   
 water. In the woods there are lots of 
 pathways for people to walk along and 
 car parks for people to park their    
 cars. The place makes you feel you are
 in the country though you are near the
 town. People come from all around     
 Bristol to see this lovely place. Some
 of the pathways are very steep and you
 can go climbing on the rocks.
