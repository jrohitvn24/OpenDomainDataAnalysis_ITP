		<content> The only place of worship in the whole
 area is the church of{St.John the     
{Baptist,}in{Hunsingore.}It belongs to 
 the{Church of England }and was built  
 by the{Dent}family about a hundred    
 years ago at the same time as the{    
{School.}People who belong to other    
 religious faiths must go to other     
 villages for their services,but any of
 them may be buried in the graveyard.It
 is also the only place licensed for   
 weddings.There is no vicar at present,
 an appointment has been made and he is
 due to start at the end of July.At one
 time each village church had its own  
 vicar,but now 4 churches are in the   
 care of the same vicar.The churches   
 take turns in arranging the services. 
 There are at least 2 services a month 
 at{Hunsingore.}Most of the people who 
 live in the area belong to the{Church 
{of England}but few go to church often.</content>
