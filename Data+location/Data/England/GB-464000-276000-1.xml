		<title>01THE HEMPLOE HILLS/COLD ASHBY</title>
		<content> The village of Cold Ashby stands on   
 the edge of a range of hills as the   
 Hemploes. The hills are formed of iron
 stone overlain in places with very    
 thick deposits of river gravel. To the
 north and east as the village this    
 ground is in process of being         
 quarried. Some of the areas previously
 quarried are now used for disposal of 
 waste, and some as a reservoir. In    
 addition to storing for domestic use, 
 this provides a recreation facility.  
 The only other important industry in  
 this area is agriculture. Some peopple
 living in the area work in the quarry 
 and on the farms, but many travel to  
 nearby towns to work.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
