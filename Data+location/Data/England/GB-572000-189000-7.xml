		<content> Children from a local school asked    
 their parents what they liked best    
 about Basildon.                       
 The ten most common answers were:     
  1. Plenty of trees and open spaces.  
 The council has worked to maintain and
 plant as many trees as possible all   
 over the area, and to keep open spaces
 for recreation.                       
  2. Plenty of shops. There are many   
 small shops over the area which though
 expensive, provide a welcome service. 
  3. Good to pensioners.               
  4. Good housing.                     
  5. Plenty of facilities.             
  6. Entertainment.                    
  7. Cleanliness.                      
  8. Good parking.                     
  9. Being near the countryside &amp; sea. 
 10. A street market in the town.
