		<content> There are two surgeries and one clinic
 in our area.They are all quite big and
 all near each other.There are several 
 district nurses who go around every   
 day visiting people. Our area is very 
 tidy and the atmosphere is            
 healthy.There are no hospitals.There  
 are a lot of old people who live in   
 small cottages.Each day the district  
 nurses have to nurse about ten        
 patients.Some of them take little time
 and are easy to nurse, but some       
 take more than half an hour.Sometimes 
 some of the nurses have to work in the
 weekends.Some of the nurses get a free
 car if they want it.The district      
 nurses have a radio control in their  
 cars so they can call each other      
 up.When you are a district nurse you  
 can choose to work either full-time   
 or part-time.
