		<title>04THE VILLAGE OF SCREDINGTON</title>
		<content> My village has one shop with a post   
 office.We have a mobile library and a 
 sweety van which comes around with    
 sweets and groceries.A fish and chip  
 van comes round at 8 o'clock every    
 wednesday. The village school has 26  
 children between the ages of 5 and 11.
 Next to the school is a playing       
 field and beyond is a grass field     
 where sheep graze.There are some becks
 with lots of fish in them             
 gudgeon,roach,catfish,eels and        
 stonefish.It is a very small quiet    
 village.Everyone is kind.There is a   
 big  playing field where the older    
 children take the young ones to play  
 cricket and football.There only three 
 buses a day to take people to the     
 nearest town Sleaford four miles away 
 .My dad grows potatoes and peas and at
 the bottom of our garden there is a   
 sheep field.Lots of people breed dogs.</content>
