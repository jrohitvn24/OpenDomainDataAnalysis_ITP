		<title>15NATURE RESERVE ON ARNE</title>
		<content>   The RSPB has had a nature reserve at
 Arne since l965.The main habitat is   
 open heathland which is one of the few
 remaining areas in Britain where the  
 rare Dartford Warbler breeds.All the  
 British species of reptile live here, 
 including adders and sand lizards. A  
 nature trail, 3/4 of a mile long, the 
 only area to which visitors have      
 access runs through the reserve,      
 leading visitors through several      
 different habitats.The trail starts in
 deciduous woodland consisting of      
 mature common oaks,and sweet chestnut,
 planted as cover for pheasants.Ground 
 cover consists of broad buckler fern, 
 ivy,bramble, bracken and holly.Some   
 silver birches have witches broom in  
 their branches.This is a growth caused
 by a fungus Taphrina turgida,and has  
 no detrimental effect on the trees.
