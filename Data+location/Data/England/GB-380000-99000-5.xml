		<title>05W.WHITECHURCH FIRST SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> Winterborne Whitechurch Church of     
 England Voluntary Controlled First    
 School is situated in the centre of   
 the village but away from the very    
 busy main road running from Blandford 
 Forum to Dorchester.                  
 The present building was built and run
 by the Church in the middle of the    
 nineteenth century but later, soon    
 after the second world war, full      
 administrative and financial control  
 was handed over to Dorset County      
 Council. Being a V.C.School the School
 retains a strong link with Salisbury  
 Diocesan Board of Education. Two of   
 the eight School Governors are        
 appointed by the Church, two by the   
 Parish Council, one by the County     
 Council,one parent and one teacher    
 governor plus the Headteacher. The    
 Governors meet at least once a term.
