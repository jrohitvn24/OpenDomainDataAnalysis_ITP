		<content> The area of this survey covers 12     
 square kilometers of mainly arable    
 land on the coastal plain between the 
 South Downs and the English Channel   
 just to the SW of the city of         
 Chichester. The land is very flat,    
 heights ranging between 3 and 13      
 metres above sea level.  In common    
 with the rest of Central Southern     
 England we do not experience extremes 
 of temperatures - the winters being   
 comparatively mild and the summers    
 warm and sunny - hence the extensive  
 greenhouses.   As well as the         
 scattered farmsteads the area includes
 part of Runcton and Oving and the     
 hamlet of Merston, all pleasant       
 residential areas.   The Portsmouth to
 Brighton/London Railway Line crosses  
 the area, the busy A27 runs E to W to 
 the north and feeds the A259 and B2166
 both leading to Bognor Regis and sea. </content>
