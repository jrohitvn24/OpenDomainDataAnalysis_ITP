     Oil importation is operated       
 jointly by Conoco and Lindsey Oil.    
 Each has its own pipeline from the Oil
 Terminal.                             
        Each of the two main pipelines 
 contains 1 million gallons of crude   
 oil and the whole length is monitored 
 continually, and there are elaborate  
 safety and anti pollution controls.   
        Because of high expansion      
 factor special expansion tanks are    
 sited at the end of the line.         
 Expansion of 30,000 gallons is common.
 The temperature is monitored at all   
 times so that accurate measure can be 
 made of oil discharged. Special tables
 are used and tonnage is converted to  
 gallons. Example: estimated value of  
 expansion tank oil one day during     
 August 1985 was Â£45,000.
