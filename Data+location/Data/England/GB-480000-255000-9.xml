		<title>09 CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content>  Some of the old fashioned games are  
still played in Denton e.g. hopscotch  
and skipping.Some games have come from 
other parts of the country.Here is an  
example by an 8 year old.It is called  
"The Track Game".                      
  To find out who is counting first we 
tap and say fast,slow,fast,slow on a   
person's back with your hands.The      
person now tells the other person to   
stop.If the person stops on slow the   
other person counts slowly.To find out 
what to count up to,you twiddle your   
fingers then stop on one finger then   
the other person guesses which finger  
hit her. Each finger costs 10.So when  
the person guesses the finger she will 
be at a number e.g.60.The other person 
will count up to 60 slowly.My friend   
goes off and hides.When she is hiding  
she has to leave tracks pointing to    
which way she has gone.                </content>
