		<content> Litlington Nursery has been in        
 existence since the late 19th century,
 but it has remained a small business  
 concern.Like many privately owned     
 concerns,profits have fluctuated over 
 the years and there have been         
 difficulties in maintaining all the   
 glasshouses and outbuildings.In the   
 past few years there has been an      
 extensive improvement in the forecourt
 carpark and particularly in the       
 restaurant facilities.Light luncheons,
 teas and coffees are served daily     
 during the summer.Customers enjoy     
 sitting in the pleasant gardens       
 partaking of their refreshment in the 
 open air when the weather permits.    
 French students were working at the   
 kiosk this summer of 1985. Several    
 cars were leaving with purchases of   
 fresh eggs,choice house plants and    
 freshly cut vegetables.               </content>
