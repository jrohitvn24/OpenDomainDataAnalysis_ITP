		<title>10SERVICES IN WOODHALL SPA</title>
		<content> In Woodhall Spa there are many        
 different sorts of small shops.       
 Although most of the shops in the     
 village have changed owners during the
 last fifty years the majority still   
 deal in the same type of goods as they
 did at that time.A very wide range of 
 goods are available for a village of  
 this size even though there is no     
 major supermarket.Most of the main    
 banks have sub branches in the        
 village.There are two schools,St.Hughs
 (private sector)and St.Andrew's(CoE   
 controlled).In Woodhall Spa most of   
 the homes are old.There are two       
 churches,St.Peter's and the Methodist 
 Church,both situated in the middle of 
 the village.
