		<content> I'm 9 years old and I go to Godshill  
 Primary School. My hobbies are Horse  
 Rangers, music and games, and I am in 
 the Church Choir. I have a brother    
 named Jason who is 5 years and he goes
 to Godshill School too. My Mum used to
 be a Manageress in a Hairdressing     
 Salon, but now she is a housewife. She
 enjoys swimming, squash and yoga. My  
 Dad works for the Electricity Board   
 and his hobbies are sport, and Natural
 and Local History. We live in a 300   
 year old cottage. We have a pet rabbit
 called Snowy. As a family we enjoy    
 walking, swimming and playing games.  
 We have an automatic washing machine, 
 a television, a vacuum cleaner, a     
 computer, a tape recorder. Our car is 
 a Ford Escort which is one year old.  
 My Mum is Secretary to my school's    
 Parent Teacher Association.
