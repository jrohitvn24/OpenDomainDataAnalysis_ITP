		<title>01CLOPHILL AND DISTRICT</title>
		<content> Our area is composed of farmland to   
 the north and east, with a medium     
 sized village in the southwest.       
{Clophill}lies along the valley of the 
 River Flitt. It is a mixture of old   
 houses and modern developments, both  
 publicly and privately owned. There   
 are{1233}names on the{Electoral Roll. 
 The nearest small towns are{Ampthill}&amp;
{Shefford,}with{Luton}and{Bedford}about
 10 miles away to the south &amp; north.   
  There is a small amount of work in   
 the area but most people commute to   
 the towns. Buses run hourly north and 
 south but only two-hourly to{Ampthill.
 Older children are bused to school at 
{Shefford}and{Harlington.              
 We have a general store/post office, a
 butcher and five public houses.       
 At{Chicksands}there is an American Air
 Force Base. It is a station for the   
 missile early warning system.         </content>
