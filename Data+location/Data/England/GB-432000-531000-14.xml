		<title>14VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The village hall was opened in 1964   
 having cost Â£12000 to build.          
                                       
 The hall is used for many functions   
 and by several organisations.These    
 include the Over 60's club, Local     
 History Society,Badminton Club,Local  
 Playgroup,Youth Club and the church.  
 There is a Village Hall Committee     
 which oversees the activities.        
 The hall is also used by the local    
 doctors as a surgery on two occasions 
 during the week.                      
                                       
 Often there is debate as to whether   
 the hall can continue to function     
 owing to the cost of repairs. Last    
 year the flat roof had to be re-felted
 and this year the floor joists hjave  
 to be renewed.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
