		<title>08SUTTON CHENEY ARCHITECTURE</title>
		<content> Sutton Cheney is, in the main         
 comprised of old but well preserved   
 and maintained property, which        
 combines to produce the typical       
 picturesque aspect of a traditional   
 South Leicestershire village.         
                                       
 St. James Church is mainly 14th       
 century with a 13th century arcade.   
 Inside the church is a monument to Sir
 William Roberts, who in 1613 was      
 responsible for the construction of   
 Hall Farm, an imposing two storey red 
 brick mansion.                        
                                       
 Sir William was also founder of the   
 Alms Houses, built in 1612 as a row of
 single storey stone cottages and      
 extended in the 19th century by the   
 addition of an attic.  The south end  
 gable still carries the nest holes    
 from a formerly attached dovecote.    </content>
