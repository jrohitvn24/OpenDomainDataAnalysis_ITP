    There are plenty of{schools}to     
 go to. There are  four schools, they  
 are:-Pickering Infants,Pickering      
 Juniors,Lady Lumley's school and St.  
 Joseph's Catholic Primary school. I   
 like some of the shops and the{cinema}
 . I wish we had more fashion shops. I 
 like the town because there is a      
 B.M.X. course and a club where  I can 
 go and play pool. I wish the town had 
 a sports centre. My house is in West  
 Carr Lane and nearly every night I go 
 up to Keld Head Springs to feed the   
 ducks that live there. I do not like  
 going to the town because it takes    
 20mins. to get there and 20mins. to   
 get back.
