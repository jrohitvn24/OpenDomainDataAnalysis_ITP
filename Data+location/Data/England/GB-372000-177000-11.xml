  WATTS BARN. It was built in 1807 by  
 Mr.Watts a tenant farmer at Springs   
 Farm ,part of the Dodington estate, as
 a barn for hay and cereals.The roof   
 collapsed  at the beginning of this   
 century, but in I928 a 21 year lease  
 was bought and Â£3000 spent on         
 converting it into a house( at        
 to-day's prices this would be about   
 Â£200,000).During the last war it was  
 occupied by 24 Land Army girls. In the
 I950s Watts Barn cottage was built to 
 house the butler, for the house then  
 had 4 or 5 servants.To-day the present
 owners have modernised the house so   
 that they can look after it without   
 servants.                             
  DEAN AND CHAPTER HOUSE.The oldest in 
 Codrington,built as a monastery in the
 late C13th.It is linked by an         
 underground passage to Court House.   </content>
