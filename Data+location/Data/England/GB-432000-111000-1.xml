		<content>   Located midway between{Southampton} 
 and the{New Forest}our area is rural  
 urban fringe. The East of the 'D'     
 block is mainly the sprawling         
 dormitory settlement of{Totton}whilst 
 the rest of the area consists of      
 fairly low lying, gently sloping, poor
 quality agricultural land. Large new  
 housing estates occupy land on the    
 outskirts of Totton. New road schemes 
 speed the flow of traffic and small   
 villages such as{Woodlands}and{Netley 
{Marsh}are losing their identities. The
 family farms are disappearing though  
 the names linger on for the housing   
 estates. The Netley Marsh Steam Rally 
 has perhaps the greatest local        
 identity and has assumed regional     
 significance, but it is the           
 neighbouring city of Southampton and  
 the New Forest that overshadow the    
 area.                                 </content>
