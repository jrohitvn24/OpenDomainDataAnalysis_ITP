		<content> The vast majority of the people in    
 employment work outside the area      
 because industrial developmemt has    
 never been a prominet feature.        
 Manufacturing activity is seldom found
 anywhere. especially since the closure
 a few years ago of a large plastics   
 factory in Stretly. What work there is
 is now almost entirely confined to    
 small businesses emplpying a few      
 people, the one exception is a medium 
 sized factory associated with the car 
 industry. The shoppong centres provide
 aome employment in the distributive   
 industries as do the service          
 industries which are concerned with   
 urban conurbations everywhere.Public  
 service industries involved with road 
 and rail transport. i.e Delivery and  
 maintainance are also apparent. There 
 is some mixed farming in the North    
 West of the area.                     </content>
