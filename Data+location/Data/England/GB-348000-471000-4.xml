   There are 6 Councillors for Warton  
and 2 for Millhead. Traffic and parking
in narrow Main Street is of perennial  
concern. Provision in a nearby quarry  
is largely ignored. A public enquiry   
in 1982 into holiday chalets proposed  
at Leighton Park, gained Ministerial   
approval, despite vigorous opposition, 
but subject to a traffic solution which
is still the subject of lively local   
debate.                                
    Minor vandalism to signs and seats 
is a regular issue. Other items include
planning, rural footpaths, transport   
services and minor complaints. The     
Council donates sums annually to local 
organistions.                          
     Chairman is Mrs.E.Rudkin who has  
had many years of public service. She  
serves on many local committees and is 
a School Governor.                     </content>
