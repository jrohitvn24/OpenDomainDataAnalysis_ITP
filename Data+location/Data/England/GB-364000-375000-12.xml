		<title>12ANDERTON BOAT LIFT,CHESHIRE.</title>
		<content> In 1875, a boat lift was constructed  
 to enable narrow boats to transfer    
 from the Trent and Mersey Canal at    
 Anderton, down to the River Weaver    
 50 feet below. Boats reached the Lift 
 via a short aqueduct, floating into   
 one of two metal caissons each capable
 of taking two 70 foot narrow boats.   
 Originally, the Lift operated         
 hydraulically, one caisson going up to
 the canal as the other descended to   
 the river. In 1908, electric motors   
 wee installed and each caisson enabled
 to work independently.                
 Anderton Lift is an excellent example 
 of Victorian engineering and ironwork 
 and is considered to be unique. It was
 recently closed and the Waterways     
 caused an outcry by suggesting it     
 should not be reopened. A campaign for
 restoration has begun but, at the time
 of writing, the issue is unresolved.  </content>
