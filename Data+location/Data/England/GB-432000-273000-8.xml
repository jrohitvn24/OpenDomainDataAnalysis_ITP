		<content> The airfield was built in 1930 and a  
 village hall in 1948.Baginton had a   
 Home Guard and A.R.P.wardens.Today    
 there is a more transient population  
 due to work re-locations.New houses   
 (50)have been built in Roman Way and  
 20 others at the other end of the vil 
 lage.Old Home Farm has been developed 
 into The Mews.Industry is represented 
 by the Alvis test works and Sprayfast.
 The village hall is the centre of     
 social activity e.g.The play group,   
 the youth club,the entertainment club 
 and the W.I. to name just a few.It is 
 also used for dances and local        
 functions.There are two fairs each    
 year in May and November.These are    
 held in the village hall and the      
 adjoining land and includes the       
 crowning of the May Queen.
