		<title>18Farming near Guisborough II</title>
		<content> Foxdale Farm is 110 feet above s.l.&amp;  
 has 176 acres(the largest of our 4    
 farms).It was established in the      
 M.Ages,but redeveloped in 1860.The    
 family has lived there for 84 years.  
 They keep cattle (20 heffers) &amp; 50    
 sheep plus 100 acres of cereal &amp; 70 of
 grass.The farmer we spoke to spent    
 most of the time complaining about the
 public.A pub. footpath runs across the
 land &amp; people trespass off it.Also    
 they dump rubbish where land has been 
 cleared.The farmer gets govt.concess- 
 ions for'fat'lambs &amp; cattle. He is    
 concerned about inflation:a tractor   
 cost Â£100 before the war &amp; now Â£36000.
 Another very old farm nearby is Bel-  
 mont Farm (170 acres).They have 120   
 ewes,300 pigs &amp; bullocks to fatten.   
 Usual rotation is wheat to barley to  
 oil seed rape (which cleans the soil).
