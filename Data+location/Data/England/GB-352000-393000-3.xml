		<title>03THE POPULATION OF PARR.</title>
		<content>     The  population of the area is in 
 the region of fifteen thousand people,
 over  half  of  them  under the age of
 thirty  five  years  and  only  two   
 thousand, approximately over  the  age
 of retirement. The  death rate for the
 borough as a  whole  in 1983 was 11.8%
 whist the birth rate was 12.3%. Within
 the area of  our  study, almost  seven
 thousand  of  the  population  were   
 economically active, from a population
 of eleven and a half thousand over the
 age  of  16  years. Five  and  a  half
 thousand  of  these were in work, just
 over  one  thousand  retired  whilst  
 thirteen hundred were seeking work. We
 calculated  this to be a rate of 5.2%,
 but it is very  striking to  note that
 of a total of five and a half thousand
 women of  working  age, four  thousand
 were economically inactive.
