		<content>                                       
   The total population of Pipewell is 
only about 67 people, living in        
approximately 15 houses. Most of the   
houses are old, detached and well kept 
with beautiful gardens running parallel
to the main street. Lead windows are   
especially popular in this village. The
old post office closed about 20 years  
ago, and now keeps the key to the      
church next door. There is a plaque on 
the old school dated 1880, but this is 
now a house which has been updated into
a modern pebble-dash cottage. There is 
a row of terraced cottages at right    
angles to the street next to a         
telephone and post box. There are three
footpaths to Great Oakley, Kettering   
and Wilbarston. The village has its own
private bus which drives the children  
each day to Rushton School.
