		<title>19Haughton Village Hall.</title>
		<content>The village hall in the center of the  
community. The present hall was built  
40 years ago. Before that all meetings 
were held in a little tin hut in Park  
Lane. It was called the Institute.     
There is a very keen village hall      
committee who make sure that the hall  
is kept in good repair and that all    
bills are paid. All the organisations  
that use the hall pay a standard       
letting fee. This more in the winter   
time because the heating and lighting  
has to be paid for. The hall is used   
quite often. Some organisations meet   
there every week. It  is used during   
the morning by the Playgroup. It is    
used for concerts and dances and can be
hired by private individuals.Everyone  
is very proud that Haughton village    
hall is the best kept Village Hall in  
Staffordshire.There is a plaque in the 
hall to commemorate this.              </content>
