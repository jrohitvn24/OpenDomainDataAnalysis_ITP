		<title>12USE OF GRASSLAND IN ALKHAM.</title>
		<content>    The land on the slopes of the      
 valley being too steep for modern     
 agricultural machinery is used for    
 rough grazing.Throughout the year     
 sheep graze in these large fields     
 which occupy approximately 40% of the 
 total land area.During winter and in  
 particular at lambing time in early   
 spring the sheep are brought to       
 pasture fields nearer the farm        
 buildings so that a closer eye can be 
 kept on them.These fields on the lower
 slopes also provide hay and silage for
 the winter months and pasture for     
 small herds of bullocks during the    
 summer.                               
    The sheep are breed for both wool  
 and meat.Contract shearers visit most 
 farms in the area during May.Lambs are
 sold at Ashford and Canterbury        
 livestock markets.
