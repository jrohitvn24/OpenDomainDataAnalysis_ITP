		<content>   Houses in Rainford fall into a      
 number of very separate categories.The
 original village followed the line of 
 the main road to Ormskirk.Most of     
 these houses have date stones which   
 put their construction mainly in the  
 nineteenth century.                   
   Rainford went through a rapid period
 of growth during the 1960's with the  
 construction of the Old Hall Estate   
 and the estate between Ormskirk Road  
 and the brook.Rainford Junction also  
 increased dramatically in size during 
 this time.                            
   The majority of houses in Rainford  
 are owner occupied although there are 
 a number of  council houses spread    
 throghout the village.At the moment no
 further expansion of the village is   
 possible without an upgrading of the  
 sewage facilities.
