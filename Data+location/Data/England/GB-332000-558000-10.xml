		<content>    Following concerted representations
 from the local population, the        
 decision to transfer pupils from      
 Kirkandrews on Eden to Burgh by Sands 
 Primary School has been deferred until
 the latter is remodelled to present   
 day standards.                        
    At present the teaching spaces at  
 Burgh are housed in HORSA huts which  
 are nearing the end of their useful   
 life.                                 
    The original decision was made in  
 1982 as part of cost cutting exercises
 allied to a fall in the number of     
 pupils attending rural schools.       
   Kirkandrews school occupies an      
 eminent position above the River Eden 
 and consists of one large room, one   
 small room,two small cloak rooms and  
 outside toilets.                      
   Mid-day meals are transported from  
 Burgh school kitchen.                 </content>
