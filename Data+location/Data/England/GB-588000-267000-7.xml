		<content>down because of Dutch Elm disease.     
Charity Farm was given to the Parish by
a former Vicar -William Howerdley- in  
1492,the income to be for the Parish   
poor and for Church repairs. Vicarage  
Farm next door was Church land. These  
two farms were bought by Greene King &amp; 
Son Ltd.                               
We were told that 15yrs ago 137 acres  
of woodland in Timworth Parish which   
abutts onto Livermere Road was bull-   
dozed and burnt to make more room for  
crops. This destroyed an annual display
of Primroses,Oxslips,Purple Orchids and
Bluebells.                             
Some hedges have been taken out but    
this area is not yet like a prairie.   
Nix Green Farm has a spring.Elms Farm  
had a pond which has been drained off. 
Charity Farm has a pond.Redcastle Farm 
has four.
