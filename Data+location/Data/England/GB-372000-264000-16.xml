		<title>16DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content> Dairy farming is carried on at        
 Walsgrove Farm and Old Yates Farm.    
 There are 160 cows at Walsgrove Farm  
 and 80 cows at Old Yates Farm. Work   
 for the day begins at around 6 a.m.   
 when the cows are brought in to be    
 milked.The milking parlour can take 16
 cows at a time with 8 on each side.   
 Milking can take up to three hours,   
 with cows to be washed prior to       
 milking, and equipment and milking    
 parlour to be cleaned afterwards.     
 The milk is stored in a refrigerated  
 tank and collected daily by a tanker  
 from The Milk Marketing Board. The    
 farmer is contracted to supply a fixed
 quota,1,221,000 litres per year which 
 he cannot exceed.An E.E.C. cut of 10% 
 in quota in 1984 caused many problems 
 for milk producers. These were to some
 extent alleviated by the dry summer   
 lessening milk production.            </content>
