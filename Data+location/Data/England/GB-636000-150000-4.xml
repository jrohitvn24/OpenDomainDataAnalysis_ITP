		<content> At about 7.30 I got up and dressed and
 then went down for breakfast. I       
 watched the{television}for a bit and  
 at nine o'clock I called up my friend 
 on my{walkie-talkie}as planned and he 
 came round 5 minutes later. Then we   
 went{skateboarding}down to the        
 seafront with my{ghetto-blaster}to see
 my friend's new 16ft boat. Afterwards 
 we went to get a drink and say hello. 
 We played in the garden for a while.  
 Then we went to the chippie at 1.30   
 for a{savaloy and chips.}After that we
 went to a cafe for a can of{shandy.}  
 Afterwards we went home to my house to
 get my{radio controlled car}which we  
 drove in the road outside my house and
 we made a scramble course. At 5.30 I  
 went home for tea and put my nicad on 
 charge for the night. I called up my  
 friend again and watched{television}  
 till 9.30 when I went to bed.         </content>
