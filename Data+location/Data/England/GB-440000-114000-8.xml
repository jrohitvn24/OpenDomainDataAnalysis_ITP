		<content> Apart from its more obvious           
 recreational function, the Common     
 provides an interesting habitat with a
 variety of wildlife. Many varieties of
 birds may be observed including owls  
 and woodpeckers as well as water fowl 
 on the cemetry lake. Foxes live in the
 area and are regularly seen in early  
 morning risking their lives by        
 crossing the busy Avenue. A small     
 Field Studies centre has been         
 established and this arranges study   
 facilities for schools and other      
 interested bodies.                    
     Unfortunately, the area also      
 attracts some of the less desirable   
 humans, who, whether through drug or  
 alchohol abuse, often pose a threat to
 others who spoil the amenity by       
 graffiti or vandalism.
