		<title>09SHOPPING SURVEY, WOOTTON</title>
		<content>   Most shops in Wootton are food      
 stores which cater for the local      
 communities' everyday needs. There are
 also a few other shops which sell     
 clothes and provide services for the  
 local community such as hairdressers, 
 chemists, DIY stores, electrical      
 repair and a launderette. There are a 
 total of 21 shops in Wootton High     
 Street. The variety of goods sold is  
 small and groceries in particular are 
 quite expensive, a common feature in a
 small village. There is also a small  
 market called Bumbles which sells a   
 great variety of second-hand goods    
 including washing machines! There is a
 doctor and a veterinary surgery in the
 market.                               
  One problem shoppers face is the lack
 of parking facilities near the shops. 
 The main road is very busy which makes
 it hard for pedestrians to cross.     </content>
