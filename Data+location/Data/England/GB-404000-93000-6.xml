		<title>06ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF MUM</title>
		<content>    My mum wakes at 7.10am and listens 
 to the news. she gets up at 7.30am and
 has her breakfast which comprises     
 cereal, a cup of tea and slice of     
 toast with marmalade on it. After this
 she gets dressed and prepares all the 
 lunches. She clears the table and puts
 the dishes in the dishwasher.         
    When we are all ready mum gives us 
 a lift to school before going to one  
 of her clinics to see her patients.   
 She is a Speech Therapist and deals   
 with people who have lisps or         
 stammers. She works from 9.00am       
 through to 2.30pm with an hour break  
 for lunch. At 5.00pm she takes my     
 brother and sister to their clubs.    
 After collecting them she either      
 watches television or has an evening  
 out.
