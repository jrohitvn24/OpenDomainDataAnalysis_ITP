		<title>16RISELEY SCOUTS</title>
		<content>      Riseley Scout group are part of  
 the Ouse Valley District,Bedfordshire.
 The group was first formed in 1917 and
 until 1937 and a present group we     
 started in 1967.  The group is now    
 made up as following:18 Beavers aged 6
 to 8 years with 3 leaders,14 cub      
 scouts aged 8 to 10 years with 3      
 leaders and 1 instructor,18 scouts    
 aged 10 to 15 years with 3 leaders and
 a commitee of parents and friends who 
 support the leaders and boys.  The    
 boys come from most villages within a 
 5 mile radius of Riseley.  The Beavers
 and cubs meet at the Margaret Beaufort
 School and the scouts at their new hut
 by the drive to Melchbourne House. The
 Pump House in Gold Street is now used 
 to store the group's camping          
 equipment.
