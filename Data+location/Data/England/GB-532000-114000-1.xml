 of three administrative parishes;     
 Ditchling,Westmeston and Streat which 
 are divided by minor roads running    
 from north to south and linked by a   
 network of footpaths. Agriculture     
 minly grazing,is widely represented   
 and there are a number of small fruit 
 farms and a flourishing vineyard.In   
 the western corner lies Ditchling with
 many attractions for the visitor      
 including a museum of local history   
 and many buildings of historic        
 interest.There is a primary school in 
 Ditchling and a rural training centre 
 for the handicapped at Westmeston.The 
 tiny hamlet of Streat has a small     
 working sandpit as a band of greensand
 crosses the area.The population is    
 scattered and sparse apart from the   
 village of Ditchling.
