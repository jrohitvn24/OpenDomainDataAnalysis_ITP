		<title>10TOMATOES:SHELLEY NURSERY</title>
		<content>  The glasshouse at Shelley Nursery,   
 Wigley is used for tomatoes.5 tomato  
 plants are grown in each peat bag and 
 watered 4 times a day by drip pipes   
 leading to each plant.They are planted
 in November and picked up to the      
 middle of the following October.There 
 are then only 2 weeks to clear the    
 glasshouse and plant the next season's
 tomatoes.The plants grow to 30 feet   
 long with an expected yield of 115    
 tons per acre.                        
  Tomatoes can get Potrytis and Red    
 Spider Mite,which are treated.White   
 fly attacks tomatoes and is killed off
 by Ichneumen wasps,which lay their    
 eggs in the fly eggs.                 
  The tomatoes used to be sold in      
 certain sizes,and a grading machine   
 was used.Now ungraded tomatoes are    
 sold in 30 lb crates for supermarket  
 sales.                                </content>
