		<title>01Ullingswick N E of Hereford</title>
		<content> The area is mainly agricultural, with 
 very few services and only scattered  
 builings. In north and west if mainly 
 grazing, in the south and east more   
 cultivated farmland.                  
                                       
 An industrial frm dominates south west
 corner, there are small workshops     
 making farm gates and prefabricated   
 barns in south east                   
                                       
 Ullingswick is a sprawling village,   
 with no real centre. Some nw houses   
 built to the south west have          
 exagerated this trend, as have the    
 small lanes which serve as roads. A   
 post office exists but is very        
 difficult to find unless you already  
 know of its locatoin
