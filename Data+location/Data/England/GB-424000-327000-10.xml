		<title>10HOUSING IN EGGINTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
                                       
 The houses in Egginton are mostly new,
 but quite a few are old. There are    
 lots of houses called something farm  
 like Manor Farm and Peartree Farm. The
 houses in Elmhurst and Dove Grove are 
 all new houses. One of the biggest is 
 Sir John Every's. He lives at the back
 of my house. The oldest house in the  
 village is in Main Street. It is oveer
 200 years old. Some of the council    
 houses are in Church Road. If you come
 out of Elmhurst you can see the woods.
 There is a flood bank that was put    
 there to stop the floods flooding the 
 woods.                                
       Nearly every house has a garden.
 The newest houses are at the back of  
 our school.
