		<content> St Peter's church built in 1160 is in 
 the hamlet of Dowland. An historic    
 building with a square tower, original
 leaded light windows, unique wooden   
 pillars and carved pew ends. The      
 church has approximately only 10      
 members in the care of one vicar who  
 covers the 4 parishes of Dolton,      
 Dowland, Iddesleigh and Monkehampton. 
 It is picturesque but with so few     
 members it is struggling to stay open 
 and holds very few services. It has a 
 peel of 5 bells re-hung in 1886,      
 costing Â£50 but unsafe to use now.    
 Iddesleigh Methodist Chapel was built 
 in 1890 and is situated just outside  
 the village. It is one of 13 chapels  
 in the Hatherleigh circuit and in the 
 care of one Minister, his deputy and  
 several lay preachers. It has a       
 membership of 26.
