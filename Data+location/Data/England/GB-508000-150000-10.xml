		<content> Cranmore school is a fee-paying Roman 
 Catholic Boys Day Preparatory school, 
 although boys of all denominations are
 accepted.  The school was founded in  
 1948, moving to Horsley in 1969.  It  
 is expanding, the latest building     
 additions being a swimming pool and   
 sports hall.  There is a nursery class
 for boys 3 - 4 1/2, a preparatory dep-
 artment for boys 4 1/2 - 7 years and  
 the senior school covering the ages 7 
 - 13.  After taking Common Entrance   
 examination, boys transfer to Public  
 Schools all over the country.  A high 
 academic success rate is achieved but 
 also great emphasis is placed on a    
 wide variety of sports.  Music plays  
 an important part in school life with 
 3 choirs, an orchestra and other      
 groups as well as an annual musical   
 play.
