		<content> Sir Hereward Wake regards conservation
 as one of the most important aspects  
 of estate management. As the major    
 landowner in this area he is able to  
 create the environs necessary for the 
 survival and preservation of local    
 wildlife. Twenty small woods covering 
 more than 100 acres, with approx.     
 250,000 trees have been created       
 containing a mixture of deciduous and 
 coniferous trees. The motorway (M1)   
 which bisects this area has been lined
 with a band of woodland, including    
 conifers which absorb some of the     
 noise pollution. High hedges have been
 replanted. Small areas not suitable   
 for cultivation are left wild in order
 that foodstuff for birds can flourish.
 A stream has been dammed to create a  
 small pond environment to encourage   
 associated wildlife, in particular,   
 wildfowl.                             </content>
