 At the smaller end are the houses on  
 the North End Road. The houses are    
 only 5m wide but have 3 floors. They  
 were{built for the Underground Engin- 
{eers.}The houses have been there for  
 about 110 years. They have large      
 gardens which are about 40m long and  
 5m wide.                              
 One of the{larger houses}is in{Well-  
{garth Road.}The house we looked at was
 about 50 years old and 25m wide. It   
 has a very large back garden and two  
 small front gardens.                  
 In the area there are also flats, bed 
 and breakfasts and small hotels,      
 especially along North End Road. The  
 larger houses are divided into flats  
 and many of the properties are rented 
 by{temporary visitors}from other      
 countries.                            </content>
