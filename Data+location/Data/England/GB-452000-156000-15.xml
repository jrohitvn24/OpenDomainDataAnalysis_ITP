		<title>15KINGSCLERE FIRE BRIGADE</title>
		<content>  In Kingsclere the Fire Brigade use a 
 water tender fire engine which carries
 1800 litres of water, a 30 foot       
 ladder, a shorter ladder, a roof      
 ladder, 16 lengths of hose, 2 small   
 hose reels and breathing apparatus.   
 There are 14  firemen, but only five  
 or six go to each call. They are      
 retained firemen, which means that    
 they have another job to do. They     
 carry a bleeper which calls them out  
 to fires. The station covers an area  
 of 60 sq. miles. The commonest type of
 fire in 1984 was chimney fires. The   
 fire brigade also go out to road      
 accidents if someone is trapped or if 
 a lorry has a dangerous load.         
  The total number of turnouts in 1984 
 was 142. Most incidents occurred      
 between 16.00 and 17.00               
  The station is run by Hampshire Fire 
 Brigade.                              </content>
