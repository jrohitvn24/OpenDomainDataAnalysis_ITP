		<content>   Guildford's climate is typical of   
 that found in S.E. England. Maximum   
 rainfall occurs between October and   
 December. The average annual temp. is 
 approx. 10 degrees C. and can range   
 from just below 0 to over 22 degrees C
   Relief is  varied and undulating,   
 presenting a scene of hills, heaths   
 and richly wooded valleys. There are 3
 principal groups of rock strata in the
 area.                                 
  1. Wealden Clay and Hastings Sands   
  2. Chalk and Greensand               
  3. London Clay covered in loams etc. 
   Podsols which have developed on     
 sandstones are covered with birch     
 woods and heath. Beech woodland and   
 grass predominate on chalk. The       
 vegetation has been affected by man's 
 activities ; hedgerows and coppices   
 are common.{By J. Burgess, J. Paisley
