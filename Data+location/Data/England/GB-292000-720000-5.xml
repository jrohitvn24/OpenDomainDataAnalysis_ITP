 St. David's is a small village of 25  
 houses where 40 people live. They are 
 mainly single storey houses,two are   
 cottage-type and two are two-storey.  
 Of these 19 are private houses and 6  
 are council houses. Four of the houses
 are holiday homes.  All the houses    
 have very large gardens separated from
 their front doors by the main road    
 through the village. The village was  
 built in 1832 by Lady Baird in memory 
 of her husband Sir David Baird,a      
 famous soldier. She also built a      
 school in 1835. This is now a private 
 house. In the centre of the village is
 the Guild Hall,built in 1919 where    
 clubs meet and local functions are    
 held.
