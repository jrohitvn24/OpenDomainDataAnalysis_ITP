		<content>    A fortified tower added to the     
 Church at Burgh provided shelter for  
 the people and animals during raids by
 the Celts.                            
    St. Mary's Beaumont was built with 
 stones from the Roman Wall on the site
 of a turret.                          
    Kingarth - a house on north bank of
 the Eden where Edward VII signed a    
 fishing charter for the councillors of
 Carlisle.                             
    Local Wells - St. Annes, by the    
 river and a large one (probably served
 the village) in the garden of Orchard 
 House, Beaumont.                      
    Station Houses at Kirkandrews and  
 Burgh are relics of the Carlisle to   
 Silloth railway line.                 
    Loch House at Beaumont is on the   
 line of the Carlisle Canal.           
    A Monument is on the spot where    
 Edward I died on Burgh Marsh.         </content>
