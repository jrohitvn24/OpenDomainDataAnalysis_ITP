             _________                 
      William Trevethan, owner of      
 Penponds Farm, farms the land of 42   
 acres with help from his wife and 2   
 teenaged sons. He built the           
 3-bedroom house at Penponds (newly    
 created from a larger farm) for his   
 family in 1982, before that having    
 lived in a mobile home while          
 establishing the dariy farm and       
 awaiting 3 years for planning         
 permission. Mr. Trevethan frequently  
 attends farm sales to see how other   
 farmers manage their land, to compare 
 farming methods, and occasionally to  
 buy machinery. He works in the        
 daylight hours and enjoys television  
 while relaxing. He also is an active  
 member of Threemilestone Methodist    
 Church.                               </content>
