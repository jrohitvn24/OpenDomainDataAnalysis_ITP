		<title>16HIGH HURSTWOOD TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> In the very severe winter of l984/5   
 roads in the village suffered frost   
 damage which is now being repaired.The
 roads are inadequate for the increase 
 in traffic. Public transport in High  
 Hurstwood consists of 2 buses a week, 
 allowing only 2 hours in Uckfield for 
 shopping etc. A voluntary organisation
 known as Helping Hands has been formed
 to assist those who need to visit     
 doctors or hospitals but have no      
 transport of their own. The hourly    
 buses to Brighton and Tunbridge Wells 
 along the A26 serve the residents of  
 Herons Ghyll. Sweethaws has no buses  
 at all. The Local Authority provides a
 coach or taxis to take secondary      
 school children to school in          
 Crowborough or Uckfield.
