		<content>Barningham &amp; Market Weston are situated
within 12 miles of 3 towns: Thetford,  
Diss &amp; Bury St Edmunds all of which    
have a substancial number of super-    
markets &amp; shops. Norwich &amp; Ipswich are 
within 25 miles,so the majority of     
household shopping is done by visiting 
these main shopping areas,by car or the
local coach company in Hopton which run
weekly shopping trips on market days.  
Each village has a small general shop  
&amp; post office (the latter being most   
important in the issuing of State bene-
fits &amp; persions).The area is well      
served by many mobile shops, on a daily
or weekly basis, they include:bread &amp;  
groceries,fresh fish from Lowestoft,   
greengrocery(local produce),mobile fish
&amp; chip shop,barber, Library van, daily 
milk, newspapers, egg deliveries - the 
local shops also deliver.These services
are most valuable to the housebound.   </content>
