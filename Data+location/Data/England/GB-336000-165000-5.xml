		<content> The wild life is that appropriate to  
 open countryside and coastal areas.It 
 is possible to find sea fish such as  
 bass,cod,mullet and eels on the coast 
 and in the estury of the Congresbury  
 Yeo as far upstream as the sluices.In 
 the fresh water ditches roach,eels,   
 tench and trout are found.            
 The bird population also reflects the 
 special qualities of the area.Heron   
 and duck are frequently seen around   
 the rhines and the usual wild birds   
 such as sparrows,blackbirds,thrushes, 
 and magpies live in the trees and     
 hedgerows.Sea gulls live on the shore.
 Plants and insects suited to the      
 countryside abound.Grasses suited to  
 salty soil grow between the two sea   
 walls.Wild iris,meadow sweet,and      
 bullrushes grow along the             
 ditches.Meadow flowers grow in the    
 hedgerows and verges.                 </content>
