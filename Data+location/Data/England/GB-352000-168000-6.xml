		<title>06LONG ASHTON RESEARCH STATION</title>
		<content> In 1903 the Long Ashton Research      
 Station was built and it was a huge   
 success. It is linked to Bristol      
 University, and its work is to        
 experiment with crops. The two drinks,
 Ribena and Babycham, were made here,  
 but this is known to very few people. 
 The Research Station is mainly        
 studying cereals now. While the       
 industry is streamlining its          
 management, the staff at Long Ashton  
 continue to do all they can to help   
 directly and indirectly. Now most of  
 the staff use computers whenever      
 necessary. Every year since the       
 Station opened there has been a       
 wassail party, where people sing and  
 watch the Morris dancing. They drink  
 hot soup and eat French bread. This   
 happens after dark, about three weeks 
 after Christmas.
