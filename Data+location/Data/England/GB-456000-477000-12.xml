		<content>{ Ampleforth Sword Dance}:- Long       
 sword dances originated in            
 pre-Christian rituals. 60 years ago   
 Cecil Sharpe researched and recorded  
 the Ampleforth dance. A monk from     
 Ampleforth revived the dance with a   
 team of 6 college boys in the 1950's. 
 Replica swords were made from one     
 found in Coxwold which had survived   
 form an earlier performance. The dance
 is still performed by long sword teams
 who visit local villages.             
{ Gormire Day}:-A tradition dating back
 to the earliest days of the school's  
 existence. It was compulsory for the  
 whole school to walk to Gormire Lake, 
 thus allowing some eccentricities in  
 the forms of transport employed. More 
 recently the day has been revived on a
 voluntary basis to provide an oppor-  
 tunity for boys and staff to carry on 
 the tradition on a social basis.      </content>
