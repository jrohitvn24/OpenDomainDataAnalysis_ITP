		<title>09SHOPS AND SHOPPING.</title>
		<content> In our area we have eight shops,two of
 which are post offices,one chip       
 shop,one butcher's,one art shop and   
 four local general grocery            
 shops.                                
         Local shops are mostly on main
 roads or in residential areas and sell
 daily needs such as papers and        
 groceries.No residential area is more 
 than 1km from a local general store   
 and most areas are within half a      
 kilometre of a shop.                  
         Most people shop outside our  
 area in supermarkets or shopping      
 centers such as Mansfield for clothes 
 etc.
