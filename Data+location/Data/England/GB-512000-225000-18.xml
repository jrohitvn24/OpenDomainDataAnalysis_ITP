		<title>18THE VILLAGE VOICE OF OFFLEY.</title>
		<content> THE VILLAGE VOICE is the monthly      
 magazine which is distributed to every
 household in the villages of Offley   
 and Lilley.This magazine is delivered 
 free and contains information about   
 forthcoming events,reviews of past    
 events, letters of thanks and various 
 articles.Each month one of the local  
 clergy write an article which has some
 moral or spiritual content;the other  
 articles are frequently on rural      
 topics.Occasionally there are         
 controversial articles to do with     
 local politics,or the late delivery of
 this free paper!                      
 In no way can this small village be   
 considered a rural backwater as there 
 is a great deal of input from the     
 outside world;many residents  work    
 in different parts of the country some
 travelling the world.At school 'World 
 News is part of the curriculum.       </content>
