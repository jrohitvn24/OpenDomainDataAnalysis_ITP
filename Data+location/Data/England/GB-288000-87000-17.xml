		<content> THE WHOLE AREA IS VERY AWARE OF THE   
 NEED FOR CONSERVATION.                
 FARMERS ARE LEAVING SMALL AREAS OF    
 WOODLAND UNCULTIVATED.THEY ARE NOT    
 CUTTING HEDGEROWS BACK SEVERLY AND    
 BEING CAREFUL IN THE USE OF           
 INSECTISIDES.                         
 THE WHOLE AREA IS NATURAL HABITAT FOR 
 MANY SPECIES OF                       
 MAMMALS,INSECTS,BIRDS,REPTILES AND    
 ANFIBEANS.WE SAW DEER,RODENTS,MANY    
 SPECIES OF BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS AND  
 BIRDS.                                
 A SMALL FARM RESERVOIR WAS VISITED BY 
 CANADIAN GEESE,HERONS,SWAN,DUCKS,DOVES
 AND BUZZARDS HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THE    
 AREA.                                 
 THE PEACE AND TRANQUILITY OF THE AREA,
 LACK OF POPULATION AND NOT BEING A    
 MAJOR TOURIST AREA HAS ENABLED PLANTS 
 AND ANIMALS TO FLORISH WHICH ARE      
 ENDANGERED IN MOST OF THE COUNTRY.    </content>
