		<title>10      A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> My day starts at 4:45 a.m.when I get  
 up,wash,and have breakfast.My mum     
 takes my sister and me to Southend-   
 on-Sea where we train with our        
 competitive swimming club for two     
 hours.After this,about 8 a.m,mum meets
 us and brings us straight back to the 
 Plume School in Maldon.               
  Our school day starts at 9:05 a.m.and
 is divided into 8 periods of 35       
 minutes each,with a break during the  
 morning and for lunch when I eat my   
 sandwiches.At 3:35 p.m.the school bus 
 brings us home to Freshfields farm    
 where I live.                         
  After doing our homework we have a   
 meal at about 5:30 p.m.If we have     
 finished all our homework we watch    
 television or read or play until      
 bedtime.Because we get up so early our
 bedtime is about 7:30 p.m.
