		<content> The Trust Homes were established after
 Lady Herbert died in 1691.She left    
 Â£6000 to Lord Torrington to build and 
 endow an Almshouse for 12 poor women  
 and 12 poor girls of Shropshire.The   
 rights of nomination were left to Lady
 Herberts brother the 2nd Earl of      
 Bradford.The present Lord Bradford    
 maintains family connections as       
 chairman of the Board of Trustees.    
  Recent memories of the Trust Homes   
 indicate that a group of local well   
 to-do middle class ladies lived at the
 homes.The orphan children lived in one
 dormitory,they had to attend church   
 twice on Sundays,wore uniforms called 
 Tibbits and Sleeves,were allowed one  
 visitor a month but could not go out  
 of the gates.Lord Torrington gave     
 Â£1000 to build a hall in the centre of
 the Almshouses,this is used by the    
 people of Preston for village events. </content>
