		<title>01INTRODUCING MONKTON FARLEIGH</title>
		<content>  Our Survey Area  is almost completely
 open{countryside}and{farmland,}on the 
 edge of the Cotswold Hills.We have the
 villages of{Monkton Farleigh,Kingsdown
 and a small part of{South Wraxall .   
 There are many small farms with mostly
{arable }and{cattle farming.}There is a
 mixture of old and new houses. Most of
 the old houses are built of{limestone,
 quarried locally.There are very{few   
{main roads}and only{one shop.}There is
 quite a lot of{deciduous woodland}in  
 our survey area.The main features are 
 Monkton Farleigh and South Wraxall    
 Manors,the Secret Underground City,and
 the Golf Course at Kingsdown.Monkton  
 Farleigh also has remains like the    
{Monks Conduit}and the{Monastery,}from 
 which the village gets its name.I     
 think our survey area is a very{quiet,
{pleasant place}and I would never want 
 to live in a town.                    </content>
