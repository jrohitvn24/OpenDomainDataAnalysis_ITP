		<title>15Ingol Squash and Golf Club.</title>
		<content>The pro is responsible for improving   
the play of club members.The course    
covers a large area of Ingol.          
The local housing estate takes its name
from the club,being called the Ingol   
Golf Village.                          
   The Club house has many cabinets    
full of trophies for golf and squash.  
There are photos of the various        
captains for golf and squash.Most of   
the money is made on the golf course   
as many non-members come for a round   
of golf and a drink afterwards.        
               The club is situated in 
a pleasant area but has a good deal of 
competition from the Preston Golf club 
and the Lea Golf Club,both of which    
are not more than eight miles away.
