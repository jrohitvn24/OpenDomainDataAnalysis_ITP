		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The area of the block covers a part of
 the village of Sutton Bridge known as 
 Wingland. This includes the bridge,the
 lighthouses and the major trunk road  
 through the village. The area is very 
 flat,in fact, most of it is under sea 
 level. Banks have been built to hold  
 back the River Nene, and the land has 
 been reclaimed fromthe sea.           
        Sutton Bridge is at the        
 junction of the River Nene and the A17
 trunk road and was once thought to be 
 an ideal site for a port.Time         
 hasprovedthis to be afalse premise and
 the village has quietened down to     
 normal tranquility.
