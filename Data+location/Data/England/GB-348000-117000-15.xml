		<title>15MONTACUTE TODAY</title>
		<content>   On Thursday a Mr. &amp; Mrs. competition
 was held in the village hall.Then came
 the day which was to end the climax to
 the carnival week.Today the actual    
 carnival procession took place with a 
 barbecue &amp; a disco to follow.         
   Today is Sunday, 10:30 a.m.I have   
 just woke up and have decided to look 
 through my binoculars at the Norman   
 Tower which stands on St. Micheal's   
 Hill.I have a marvellous view as my   
 window is situated vertically opposite
 the tower.It is so peacefull up here ,
 admiring the excellent craftsmanship  
 that has gone into the building of    
 the tower.Smothering the tower are    
 hundred upon hundred of trees each at 
 their peak.A few hundred yards away   
 from my house is the West Drive of the
 famous Montacute House.
