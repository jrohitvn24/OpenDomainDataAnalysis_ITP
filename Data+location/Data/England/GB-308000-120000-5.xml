		<title>05SHEEP FARMING</title>
		<content> I am writing about my farm and the    
 sheep we keep.My dad farms because his
 parents farmed before him.In the flock
 of Border Leicester Suffolk cross we  
 have fifty ewes and two rams.The farm 
 consists of twenty acres of land and  
 we use it for grazing the sheep.This  
 year it has been quite a good season  
 for lambing but we do not keep them we
 send them to the slaughter house. Our 
 oldest sheep is about six and she was 
 one of the first sheep that we had    
 because we reared her from a lamb.    
 Twice a year we have to dip our sheep 
 because if we don't they will get a   
 disease called scab. In the summer we 
 sheer our sheep and we send the wool  
 to the wool board to be made in to    
 yarn.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
