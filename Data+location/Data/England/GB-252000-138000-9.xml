		<content>     Westcott Barton is mentioned in   
 the original Domesday Book of 1086.   
 The farmhouse which stands today was  
 built later, but there is still a     
 preservation order on it and the other
 farm buildings.                       
     Mr.&amp; Mrs.May farm 270 acres and   
 have farmed this land for 25 years.   
 They keep 55 beef cattle and at the   
 moment have 300 ewes and 300 lambs.   
 They make hay and grow nearly 100     
 acres of barley. Each field covers    
 between 15 and 20 acres. Two people   
 help on the farm and they use extra   
 labour at harvest time.               
     We chose this farm because it was 
 mentioned in the first Domesday Book  
 and it is interesting to see how it   
 has changed.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
