		<content>Ribby Hall was not always a Leisure    
Village.A long time ago it was         
completely different.The reception used
to be an old barn,and the Inn was some 
stables.At first the hall was owned by 
Mr.Duckworth,he used it as a private   
house.Then the army used it for office 
use,then it was bought and used as a   
school for the deaf and blind.Then it  
changed hands again and it was used for
agricultural uses.Now Mr.Taylor owns it
and it is divided into seperate        
flats.Mr.Taylor has plans for a Hotel,a
swimming pool and a dry ski slope to be
built onto the Hall.When Mr.Taylor came
to the Hall there was an old barn all  
run down,and full of cats.He renovated 
it and now a family lives there.
