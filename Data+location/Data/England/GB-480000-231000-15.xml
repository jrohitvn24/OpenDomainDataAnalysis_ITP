We went to Whaddon House to visit Mrs  
WEeatherby.  Whaddon House was the     
rectory until the 1930's.  The house   
stands at the end of Vicarage Road and 
the building that is there now is the  
third house.  The first house was      
Elizabethan and there are some walls   
still standing which were built in     
Elizabethan times.  The house stands on
field that was know as Lammas Close.   
Mr and Mrs Weatherby have a 250 acre   
farm.  They keep Welsh Black Cattle for
beef.  They have a few horses and the  
rest of the land is arable - corn and  
wheat.  Most of the farms in this area 
are arable farms but Coddimore farm and
Bottlehouse farm keep sheep as well.   
Coddimore farm breed horses.  Mrs      
Weatherby thought that they had more   
pasture land than other farms in the   
area.                                  </content>
