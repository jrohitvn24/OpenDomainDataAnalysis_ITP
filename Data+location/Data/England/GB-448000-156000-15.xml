 RELIGION DOES NOT PLAY AN IMPORTANT   
 PART IN THE LIFE OF MANY PEOPLE TODAY.
 ST. MARY'S CHURCH AT SYDMONTON WAS    
 BUILT IN 1853 TO REPLACE AN OLD CHAPEL
 OF THE 12th CENTURY AND WAS WELL      
 ATTENDED AT ONE TIME. LESS PEOPLE ARE 
 EMPLOYED IN THE COUNTRY THESE DAYS    
 WITH MECHANISATION, AND WHEN SYDMONTON
 COURT WAS SOLD, THE CHURCH WENT WITH  
 IT. SADLY, THE PRESENT OWNER HAS HAD  
 IT DE-CONSECRATED AND NOW USES IT FOR 
 HIS OWN PRIVATE CONCERTS. THERE IS    
 STILL A CHURCH IN ECCHINSWELL AND     
 SEVERAL PEOPLE FROM THIS AREA ATTEND  
 SERVICES THERE. GENERALLY THE CHURCH  
 OF ENGLAND IS THE RELIGION OF THOSE   
 WHO STILL FOLLOW THE CUSTOM.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
