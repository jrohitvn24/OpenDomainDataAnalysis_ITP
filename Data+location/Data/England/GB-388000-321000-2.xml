		<title>02 Stafford Castle.</title>
		<content>        In our block we have Stafford  
Castle.There have been archaeological  
excavations since 1978. The plan is to 
make an educational and recreational   
site.The archaeologist in charge runs  
the research programme.                
        The buildings would have all   
been made of timber when first built in
1069.Over the next 250 years many of   
them would be rebuilt to make them more
comfortable.In 1348 the castle was     
rebuilt in stone.In 1643 during the    
Civil War the castle was demolished by 
order of the Parlimentary Committee. It
was 1800 when the Jemingham's rebuilt  
it in the new Gothic style on the      
Medieval walls.In 1950 the castle was  
abandoned due to deterioration.In 1961 
Lord Stafford granted the castle and   
part of the inner bailey, a gift to    
Stafford Borough Council.In 1980 a     
visitors trail was opened.             </content>
