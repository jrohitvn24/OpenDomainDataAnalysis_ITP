		<content>Children from this area attend state   
primary schools in Nettlebed or        
Nuffield, a distance of 4/5 miles. They
are taken to and from school by buses  
run by the local authority.  Children  
of secondary school age attend state   
schools in Henley until they are aged  
16, then they go to King James 6th Form
College or Henley Technical College.   
Secondary school children are also     
collected by bus for their 8 mile      
journey.                               
Parents can choose to educate their    
children in private fee paying         
schools.  There are special schools    
and units to provide education for     
children with special needs.  These    
schools can be either privately or     
state owned. None of these schools are 
in this area.
