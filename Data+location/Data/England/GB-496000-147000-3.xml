		<title>03TEENAGERS IN GUILDFORD</title>
		<content>  Guildford is a very enjoyable place  
 to live for today's teenagers. There  
 are many different activities         
 available for leisure, sport and      
 entertainment.                        
  Places to go to include the Sports   
 Centre, for the energetic, and the    
 Lido, an open-air swimming pool, which
 proves extremely popular in the summer
 The Civic Hall offers a variety of    
 concerts, from pop to classical music,
 and holds a regular disco.            
  In Guildford, we see a number of     
 different fashions worn. The trend    
 this summer is for vivid flowered     
 apparel; these patterns are seen on   
 everything from croptops to socks.    
 Skirts are worn longer this summer;   
 these are at their best when teamed   
 with huge shirts and thick belts.
