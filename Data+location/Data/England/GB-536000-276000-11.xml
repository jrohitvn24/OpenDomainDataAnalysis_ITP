		<content>  SOMERSHAM IS SURROUNDED BY FARMLAND  
 AND IS SITUATED ON THE EDGE OF THE    
 FENS. FEN SOIL IS LARGELY PEAT WITH A 
 HIGH PERCENTAGE OF NITROGEN WHICH IS  
 VERY SUITABLE FOR INTENSIVE CROP      
 CULTIVATION. IN THE FIELDS AROUND     
 SOMERSHAM CROPS SUCH AS WHEAT, BARLEY,
 OIL SEED RAPE, SUGAR BEET, POTATOES   
 AND VEGETABLES ARE GROWN. MORE        
 SIGNIFICANT, HOWEVER, IS THE          
 CULTIVATION OF FRUIT. THERE ARE       
 SEVERAL LARGE ORCHARDS OF APPLE TREES 
 AND ALSO PEARS, PLUMS AND GREENGAGES. 
 SOFT FRUIT IS ALSO GROWN ON SMALL     
 HOLDINGS AROUND SOMERSHAM. THE        
 STRAWBERRY FIELDS ARE RENOWNED AND    
 ATTRACT PEOPLE FROM THE SURROUNDING   
 AREA TO COME AND PICK THEIR OWN FOR A 
 LOWER PRICE THAN THE READY PICKED     
 ONES. OTHER SOFT FRUIT INCLUDES       
 GOOSEBERRIES, RASPBERRIES AND BLACK-  
 CURRANTS.                             </content>
