		<title>01GENERAL SURVEY OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> The block covers an area of country in
 south Herefordshire bordering Glouces-
 tershire.A lush agricultural region of
 dairy,grain and orchard with large    
 tracts of softwood forest plantations.
 Linton village dating back to Norman  
 times lies wholly within the block    
 whilst Upton Bishop borders the N.W.  
 Most of Gorsely is within this wooded 
 and once gorse covered area and was   
 for two centuries the haunt of        
 ciminals.Those in Ross nick_named it  
 "The Republic of the lawless" and     
 Gorsley common became known as        
 "Heathens Heath."The area was         
 notorious for its unruly behaviour and
 often the Hereford to London  stage   
 coach was held up and plundered as it 
 made its way through the village en   
 route to Gloucester. By refering to   
 the following entries you will see    
 how different it has become.          </content>
