		<title>03THE TREFUSIS FAMILY</title>
		<content>   Mrs. Trefusis married into the      
 family in 1940 and her grandson is the
 28th generation of the family.The     
 earliest record historians have of the
 Trefusis family living in Flushing    
 goes back to the early 12th century,  
 this is confirmed by the prefix Tre-  
 which means pre-Norman times.         
   The estate was larger in Norman     
 times than it is now,although it is   
 1000 acres today it used to include   
 Constantine and the surrounding       
 area.They used to keep cows and       
 bullocks and they had 1.5 acres of    
 vegetables and flowers.               
   During the war there was a lot of   
 work done in the docks,there was a    
 canteen in the village for the crews  
 of the barrage balloons based in      
 Flushing.
