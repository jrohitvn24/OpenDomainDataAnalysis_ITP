		<content> The landscape is a chalk plateau      
 rising gently towards the south.      
 Land use is almost completely         
 agricultural with larger than average 
 fields and few hedges.   This,        
 together with the predominant growth  
 of cereals, has led to it being       
 described as the "Wiltshire Prairies".
 The principle village is Chiseldon    
 which, with its outlying hamlets, has 
 a population of approx.2500.   Many of
 these commute to the industrial and   
 commercial concerns in and around     
 Swindon.   Princess Alexandra's Royal 
 Air Force Hospital, Wroughton is      
 established to the west of the block  
 and serves all three arms of the      
 forces and also accepts civilian      
 patients from the locality.   Running 
 across the block is the Ridgeway      
 ancient trackway, now used as a long  
 distance walk.   A large tract of land</content>
