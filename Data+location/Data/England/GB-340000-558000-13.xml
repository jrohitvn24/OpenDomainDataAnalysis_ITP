		<title>13THE LETTUCE FARM</title>
		<content> Mr Lamb owns Linstock Nurseries,a     
 large market garden in this small     
 village a few miles outside Carlisle. 
   He told us about the nurseries.The  
 main crop is lettuce which he grows   
 all the year round,but of course in   
 the winter inside the huge heated     
 greenhouses.He plants them in         
 rotation,in batches of about 6000 at a
 tme, so that there are always some    
 ready for cropping.                   
   He sells them on his family's stall 
 in Carlisle's large covered market and
 has to get up very early each morning 
 to take them in.                      
  He also grows peppers,celery,potatoes
 and tomatoes,but this is really a     
 lettuce farm.Mr Lamb said that because
 the weather had been so poor this     
 spring and summer and the automatic   
 heaters had been on for much longer   
 than usual the lettuces cost more.    </content>
