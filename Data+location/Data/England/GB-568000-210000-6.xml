		<title>06HOME FARM LT.WALTHAM II</title>
		<content>  As there are only three men working  
 the farm they need a lot of machinery.
 they have got four tractors.Outside   
 the tractor is very noisy but once    
 inside it is much quieter.The farmers 
 have a radio inside the tractor to    
 keep them company while they are      
 working, there are also a lot of      
 controls including ten gears, they    
 need these to gain more power from the
 engine, the rest of the controls are  
 very similar to cars but larger.On the
 front of the tractor you can add      
 weights to balance it up.The two large
 tyres at the back of the tractor cost 
 over six hundred pounds each.The      
 tractors now a days are much more     
 comfortable than what they were.Also  
 on the farm they have got a Combine   
 Harvester,this is used for cutting,   
 threshing and baling.
