		<content>There are nearly two hundred houses in 
Tetsworth. Two are thatched cottages.  
Some of the houses are more than three 
hundred years old and many more have   
old foundations, beams and walls. Some 
of the older buildings are reputed to  
have gardens which are laid out the    
same today as they were in the last    
century. There has been a lot of       
building in the village over the past  
fifty years. Marsh End, an estate of   
houses,flats and bungalows was built   
on the edge of a marsh. More recently  
an estate was built on the site of a   
large house called the "Laurels". Near 
the church is the old vicarage, built  
at the time of the church itself. A    
block of old people's flats was built  
in the 1970s. Detached houses are      
being built today opposite the         
telephone exchange.
