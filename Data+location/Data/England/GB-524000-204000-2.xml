		<content>    Chancellor's School is the local   
 secondary school. It was opened in    
 1964 and takes in children mostly     
 from Brookmans Park.                  
    In 1979 it became quite well known 
 nationally as it was threatened with  
 closure. A campaign was set up to     
 fight the decision and after several  
 months of argument it was allowed to  
 remain open.                          
    It is called Chancellor's School   
 after Sir Thomas Moore who was        
 Chancellor to King Henry Vlll. He     
 lived in the area in a mansion called 
 Gobions or as it was then called      
 Gubbins.Ruins of the house can still  
 be seen in what is now an open area.  
    The school emblem is a wig which is
 similar to that worn by the           
 Chancellor.
