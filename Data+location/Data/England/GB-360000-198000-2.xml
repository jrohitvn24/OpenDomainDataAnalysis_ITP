		<content> Alvington is situated on the North    
 Bank of the Severn Estuary in the     
 county of Gloucestershire and is      
 approximately 100 feet above sea      
 level.  The climate of the area is    
 damp and windy with quite severe      
 winters.  It is a very rural,         
 unspoilt area. Conservation and       
 wildlife are therefore helped greatly 
 with hedgerows and mudflats.          
 Migrating birds and geese make use of 
 the mudflats on route to and from the 
 Slimbridge Wild Bird sanctuary on the 
 other side of the river. Footpaths are
 clearly defined.                      
 There are three family owned farms in 
 the area.  One of the farms _         
 Alvington Court farm _ was mentioned  
 in the original Doomsday Book.  All   
 three are dairy and sheep farms.  Also
 because the river Severn is tidal     
 salmon and elver fishing take place,  </content>
