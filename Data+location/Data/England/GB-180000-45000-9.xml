		<content> At Polwhele there is a{Veterinary     
{Investigation Centre.}It is managed by
 the{Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
{&amp; Food.}The main purpose of the Centre
 is to keep a check on animal diseases 
 that occur in Cornwall and the Isles  
 of Scilly. It is the only one of its  
 kind in Cornwall and at the present   
 time the Ministry wishes to close it. 
 It is chiefly a laboratory, operating 
 as a service to Veterinary Surgeons,  
 testing samples from diseased animals 
 and carrying out post-mortems, in     
 order to diagnose diseases. It mostly 
 deals with farm animals but wildlife, 
 such as badgers, are also checked for 
 diseases that might spread to healthy 
 animals. The Centre employs 14 civil  
 servants, i.e. 3 veterinary surgeons, 
 2 clerical staff and 9 laboratory     
 technicians.
