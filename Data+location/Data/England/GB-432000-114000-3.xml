		<title>03PAULTONS COUNTRY PARK</title>
		<content>  The public park, opened in 1983,     
 opens                                 
  on most days. The house is private.  
 Inside the grounds are lakes, rivers, 
 museums and  many rare animals.  There
 are two weirs, the old one is on      
 private grounds.  The purpose of the  
 weirs is to keep the water in the lake
 level. You can get to the new weir by 
 walking through the grounds.          
 The saw mill (powered by water) was   
 built in l860, it still works but is  
 not used.  The lake is filled from    
 Cadnam river and the storm drains of  
 the M27.                              
 The lake is 200 years old.            
 The land is very well cared for.      
 There are village life displays       
 showing people's old jobs, dairying   
 carpentry etc.  There is also a Romany
 village which consists of gypsy       
 wagons.                               </content>
