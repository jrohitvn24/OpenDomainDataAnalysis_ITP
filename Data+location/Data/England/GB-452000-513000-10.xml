		<content> A survey of children at Captain Cook  
 Junior School found the most popular  
 game in the school-yard to be{        
{'runacross'.}This game is where one   
 person is 'on' and the rest of the    
 children are all inside a safe area at
 one side of the yard. The person 'on' 
 shouts "Runacross!" and all the       
 children run across the yard to a safe
 area on the opposite side. You do this
 until the person 'on' manages to 'tag'
 someone, they too are now 'on'. The   
 children 'on' keep on tagging until   
 there is only one person left and he  
 is the winner. The game then starts   
 all over again with the person tagged 
 first 'on'. The next most popular yard
 game was{'skips'}this being played    
 mostly by the girls. The ever popular 
{'marbles'}came third. For play out of 
 school times there are play areas, but
 most children think these inadequate. </content>
