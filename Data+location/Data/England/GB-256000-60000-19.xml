		<title>19THE LEE MOOR BY-PASS ROAD.</title>
		<content> To enable the reserves of china clay  
 to be extracted,which are to the east 
 of Lee Moor village,a new road had to 
 be constructed.This new section of    
 road stretches from Tolchmoor Gate to 
 Wotter.As well as being routed clear  
 of the china clay deposits,it also    
 by-passes Wotter and Lee Moor         
 villages.With the completion of this  
 road the original Cornwood to Cadover 
 Bridge road,which crosses the area of 
 extraction,has been closed.Now there  
 is no road which goes right through   
 Lee Moor village,the only access being
 from the new road.The same applies to 
 Wotter village,the edge of which is   
 within the grid.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
