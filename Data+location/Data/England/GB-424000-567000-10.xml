		<title>10GOSFORTH SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content> In 1980 they opened the Gosforth      
 Shopping centre. It was made from     
 bricks outside and marble inside.     
 There are shops on the ground floor   
 and a car park on the top floor and   
 lifts joining the two.                
 In the middle there is an atrium with 
 a glass roof and fountains and plants.
 Because it is covered it needs lights 
 on all day. At night all the centre is
 closed.                               
                                       
 Most people go to Presto which is a   
 supermarket.                          
 Because most people shop in the       
 supermarket other shops had to close  
 down.                                 
 There are shops called Boots, Martins,
 Northern Rock, a Post Office and Radio
 Rentals.                              
 There are two bakers, a butcher, a    
 greengrocer and a freezer shop.       </content>
