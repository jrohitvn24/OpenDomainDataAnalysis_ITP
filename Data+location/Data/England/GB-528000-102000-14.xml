           The Evening Argus (JULY '85)
                                       
 A report out on the 15th July 1985    
 showed that Brighton was going        
 downhill.People are moving out but the
 housing problem still remains acute   
 with extortionately high rents and    
 rates; unemployment has risen and     
 there is a mismatch between jobs being
 created in the offices and people     
 being laid off from manufacturing.The 
 only growth sector has been in office 
 work where 6,000 new jobs were created
 in the area between 1971 and 1981;    
 rising car ownership has put pressure 
 on the pre-existing road pattern and  
 parking.About 250,000 cars pass       
 through central Brighton every        
 weekday;and the shopping centre is    
 declining as the development of out of
 town hypermarkets continues.          </content>
