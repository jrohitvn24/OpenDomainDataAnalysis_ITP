		<content>  During the past five or so years, the
 village of High Wych has been         
 recognisably changed, by increasing   
 traffic and building.High Wych has had
 two major developments in the past    
 five years, Rivers has been sold off  
 and has been turned into  a garden    
 centre and Dixons garage has been     
 turned into fourteen houses. High Wych
 used to be part of the old parish of  
 Sawbridgeworth.The church dates from  
 1860,it has a parish magazine called  
 The Link.There is a High Wych school  
 attended by 175 children.There is a   
 fair bit of history in High Wych      
 despite the new houses.The amount     
 of people in High Wych has increased  
 in the last 8 or 9 years.There is only
 one shop in High Wych called High Wych
 General Stores and they get their     
 supplies from the firm Londir and from
 Cash and Carry.                       </content>
