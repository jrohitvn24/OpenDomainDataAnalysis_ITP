 The boundary hedges of Hailes Abbey   
 were dated using the technique of     
 Hooper &amp; Pollard. An average of 7     
 shrub / tree species  was obtained per
 30 yard stretch of hedge. This would  
 date the hedges at 677 years, which   
 corresponds quite well with the       
 founding of the monastery in 1246.    
{SURVEY                                
 The following species were found:     
 ELM,  ELDER,  HAZEL,  HAWTHORN,       
 FIELD MAPLE,   GUELDER ROSE,  SPINDLE,
 DOGWOOD,  SLOE, CHERRY PLUM (Prunus   
 cerasifera), WILD PRIVET, OAK &amp;       
 GOAT WILLOW.                          
                                       
 The hedges support a rich invertebrate
 fauna , notably parasitic hymenoptera,
 sawflies and beetles.
