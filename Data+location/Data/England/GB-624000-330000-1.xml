		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> This D-Block includes parts of 5      
 parishes to the west of North Walsham.
 Felmingham,Suffield,Antingham,        
 Swafield and North Walsham.           
 The area around Antingham is fairly   
 flat,open agricultural                
 land.Cereals,sugar beet,peas,beans and
 potateos are the main crops grown on  
 the medium light soil.The main        
 woodland near here is Gunton Park.This
 is a Conservation Area which means you
 have to have special permission to cut
 trees or build or knock down          
 buildings.The area between Antingham  
 and North Walsham includes a small    
 rather overgrown valley which was once
 part of the North Walsham and Dilham  
 Canal.Bradfield Bridge is very big as 
 it was probably built for barges_there
 is also a Barge Farm which seems to   
 conect the area with canals although  
 the canal is hardly visible now.      </content>
