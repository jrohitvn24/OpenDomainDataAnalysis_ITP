 Infant classes are on Lawrance Park   
 and the three Junior classes are in   
 the old school.There are 152 children 
 aged 5 to eleven in the school.The    
 old school was built in 1877.The old  
 school is on Station Road.At the back 
 of the main school there is a         
 playground,a garden and out door      
 toilets.In fine weather we can play in
 the garden or eat our dinner there.We 
 have to bring our sandwiches since    
 school meals were stopped.We go to    
 Lawrance Park Hall for PE,Games Music 
 and Assembly.The New School will be   
 built onto the hall in October this   
 year.When the children are eleven they
 are selected for the Grammar or       
 Secondary School in Bourne.Some       
 children go by bus others have to get 
 there by themselves as they do not    
 live far enough away to have a buspass</content>
