		<title>14CLUBS AT CROPWELL BUTLER</title>
		<content> A{Youth Club}for boys and girls aged  
 9-16 was formed in 1982 by the Village
 Hall Committee. It was thought that   
 the increasing vandalism in the       
 village, mainly caused by the younger 
 element, was due to lack of facilities
 in the village for this group. There  
 is an adult Committee Supervisor and  
 the Club meets every Tuesday, 7:30 to 
 10:00. Some decrease in the vandalism 
 has ensued.                           
{Rendezvous Club.} The welfare of the  
 "Over 60's" is the concern of the     
 Rendezvous Club. They meet on         
 Wednesday afternoons in the Village   
 Hall and play cards or dominoes, or   
 chat over tea. Outings are organised  
 annually. This year a tour of North   
 Yorkshire included a visit to         
 Knaresborough and Richmond.
