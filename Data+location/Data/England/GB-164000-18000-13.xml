		<title>13ST.WINWALOE'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> St.Winwaloe's Church at Church Cove,  
 Gunwalloe is a very small church which
 can accommodate only about 50 people  
 for a service. It was built in the    
 12th century and has a separate bell  
 tower 3 metres away from the church,  
 and is unusual in having 3 altars. In 
 the 12th century it was quite a long  
 way from the sea, but coastal erosion 
 now threatens it with destruction. The
 sea wall which was built to protect it
 needs constant and sometimes costly   
 maintenance. The roof needs repair.   
 Fortunately this cove is very popular 
 with tourists who find the church     
 interesting and are willing to make   
 donations towards its maintenance. It 
 is luckier than some which fall apart 
 in out of the way places, forgotten by
 everyone.
