		<title>07RESULTS OF TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> Results analysis:                     
 There were several expected variations
 in traffic volumes,such as the early  
 morning and late afternoon peak       
 figures, the discrepancy between      
 in-coming and out-going traffic during
 the "rush" hour, and low figures for  
 taffic during the evening.  Less      
 predictable was the marginal          
 difference in traffic between the two 
 roads - quite clearly, the building of
 the Canterbury by-pass has            
 considerably reduced volumes on the   
 old A2.  The A257 is a particularly   
 congested route, however, especially  
 considering the width of road and the 
 number of minor feeder routes.        
 Results of other supplementary        
 surveys:  The                         
 Canterbury-Littlebourne-Sandwich      
 Road(A257) was found to be busier than
 the A2.                               </content>
