		<content>    From the results of the Domesday   
 survey,it would appear that the       
 majority of church goers interviewed  
 were married or confirmed before they 
 moved into the area.So it follows that
 a large number of people are not      
 native to the area.                   
  A lot of the people in the area      
 either go to Eye village church or to 
 the local Newborough church.37% of    
 them walk,no one cycles,23% travel    
 there by car and one percent go by    
 bus.                                  
  Out of the sample interviewed 10%    
 go to church weekly, 9% go monthly    
 and 45% go occasionally usually for   
 festivals or special occasions.36%    
 don't go to church.The main reason for
 not going was,"I have not got enough  
 time".                                
                                       
                                       </content>
