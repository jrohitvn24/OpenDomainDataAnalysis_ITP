		<title>13LAW AND ORDER IN MORETON</title>
		<content> The{police}in Moreton use 2 Ford      
 Escort cars and 2 bicycles.The cars   
 are{equipped}with waiting signs,      
 Accident signs, First Aid kit, Radio  
 and a tape measure. The Policeman uses
 a truncheon ( kept in a long pocket   
 down his trouser leg),a walkie-talkie 
 radio, a whistle and a note book. The 
 police station is situated in the High
 Street and it has one cell. It is not 
 operated all the time, but it has an  
 answering machine. One of their       
 busiest days of the year is when Glos.
 Cricket Club play in Moreton and up to
 4000 people come and watch, but some  
 try to get in free.Another busy day is
 the day of the Show when crowds up to 
 20000 can cause traffic{problems.     
 Market Day is also a busy time for    
 them. Recently a Hippie convoy came   
 through on their way to Stonehenge and
 caused an accident on the bridge.     </content>
