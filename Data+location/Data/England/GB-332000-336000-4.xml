		<title>04FARMING-GRASSLAND</title>
		<content> Most of the land is covered by        
{permanent grassland.}Animals{graze    
 it.Sometimes farmers use an electric  
 fence so that the animals can only eat
 a bit at a time.Some grass is cut and 
 dried in{June}to make{hay}which is fed
 to animals in winter.Most is cut and  
 taken to a big pit at the farm.It is  
 covered with polythene sheets.It gets 
 hot and ferments.It smells horrible   
 but cows like to eat it in            
 winter.                               
{Barley and oats}are grown for         
 animal feed.As they are growing they  
 are sprayed with chemicals to kill    
 diseases.In summer a combine harvester
 cuts the{corn}and takes it to a big   
 bin at the farm.It is ground up and   
 fed to the animals.Farmers put        
 fertilizer on their fields to put into
 the soil to grow good crops.
