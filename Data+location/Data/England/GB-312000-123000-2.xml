		<title>02THE PARISH CHURCH, MILVERTON</title>
		<content>      THE PARISH CHURCH OF MILVERTON IS
 CALLED ST MICHAEL AND ALL ANGELS. IT  
 IS BUILT ON THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE  
 VILLAGE. SOME PARTS OF THE CHURCH ARE 
 VERY OLD. THE OLDEST PART IS THE SAXON
 FLOOR. IT IS A BIG SQUARE HOLE WITH   
 COLOURED TILES AT THE BOTTOM. THE     
 CHURCH WALLS ARE MADE OF A DUSTY PINK 
 STONE CALLED SANDSTONE. THE TOWER WAS 
 STARTED IN 1200 AD.                   
                                       
      THERE ARE EIGHT BELLS IN THE     
 TOWER, AND NARROW SPIRAL STEPS GO UP  
 TO THEM. THE TOWER IS VERY TALL. THE  
 LECTERN IS SHAPED LIKE A GOLDEN EAGLE.
 THERE IS A NORMAN FONT MADE OF STONE  
 WITH A PATTERN LIKE A TWISTED ROPE    
 ROUND IT. THE WINDOWS ARE MORE THAN   
 ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD. THEY ARE       
 RAINBOW COLOURED, AND HAVE PICTURES OF
 SAINTS IN THEM. INSIDE THE CHURCH IT  
 IS VERY QUIET AND PEACEFUL.           </content>
