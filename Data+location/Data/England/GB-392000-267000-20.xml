		<title>20GARDEN CENTRE SALES,W'BOLD</title>
		<content> In {Wychbold}we have {Webb's Garden   
{Centre}and the packets of seeds are   
 well known all over the country.On a  
 visit to the centre we found that it  
 was not the seeds that were best      
 sellers,so we asked for information   
 about the types of sale.The graph of  
{sales}was as follows:                 
                                       
{********}Trees and shrubs             
{*******}Sundries                      
{******}House plants                   
{*****}Compost                         
{****}Flowers and seeds                
{***}Fencing and slabs                 
{**}Furniture and aquatics             
{*}Fruit trees,vegetables,books and jam
                                       
 The company propogates 3/4 of all the 
 plants and shrubs sold in the main    
 area and in 1984 its total turn-over  
 exceeded one million pounds.          </content>
