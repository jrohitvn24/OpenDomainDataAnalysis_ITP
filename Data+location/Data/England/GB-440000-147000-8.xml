		<title>08OLD RAILWAY NEAR ANDOVER</title>
		<content> Running south from the present main   
 London railway line at the spot where 
 the Bourne Rivulet passes beneath it, 
 one can still make out most of the    
 route of the now dismantled           
{Hurstbourne to Fullerton railway.     
     Opened on the 1st June 1885, and  
 the track finally lifted in October   
 1934, all that remains for most of its
 length is a wide overgrown ditch,     
 sometimes shallow, but nearer to      
{Hurstbourne Priors,}developing into a 
 two-mile chalk cutting, in places up  
 to fifty feet deep.                   
     This part is full of atmosphere,  
 often gloomy and damp, roofed over by 
 the trees high above and eerily quiet.
 However, the silence is temporary, for
 much of this dramatic cutting is used 
 by the local{Game Shooting School.
