		<title>02LONDON INN.</title>
		<content>   The London Inn is in the centre     
 of Summercourt. It is a very old      
 building and is about 200 years old,  
 stone built with a slate roof.        
 The outside has recently been whitened
 and the inn sign decorated. It sells  
 beer and bar food and is open seven   
 days a week.                          
    The present landlords are Mr and   
 Mrs Gill who have been there about    
 1 year and are tenants of the St      
 Austell brewery.A new kitchen has been
 built and a family room provided.The  
 grounds  around the pub are well cared
 for and a beer garden section has been
 grassed in the last year. This now has
 3 wooden benches on it in the shade of
 some sycamore trees.The pub is well   
 decorated with flower boxes and       
 hanging baskets and has a car park at 
 the rear.
