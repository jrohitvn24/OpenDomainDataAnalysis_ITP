		<title>03The History Of Carsington</title>
		<content> Research and Excavations since 1974   
 have confirmed that this was the site 
 of a Roman Village and suggest a      
 period of occupation of 250 years     
 until the mid forth century.The Romans
 were concerned with lead mining from  
 Carsington Pastures and the remains   
 now discovered,confirm the smelting of
 lead and it's distribution on the     
 nearby road between Buxton and Derby. 
 In the Doomsday Survey Ghersintune(now
 carsington) was owned by the Earl of  
 Shrewsbury and had 206 inhabitants.   
 Today there are 81 people living in   
 32 houses.During the reign of Queen   
 Elizabeth 1rst the village came into  
 the possession of Ralph Gell.The gell 
 family still own property in the      
 village.The stone on the village green
 was brought from another part of the  
 village in 1979.It is believed to have
 been erected by St Betti in 653 A.D.  </content>
