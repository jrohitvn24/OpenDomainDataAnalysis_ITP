		<title>03A usual day in my life</title>
		<content> I am a boy attending Whittlesford     
 Primary school. On a usual day,  I    
 wake up at about 7.30 and start       
 playing with my toys. At about 8.00, I
 get washed and go down stairs for     
 breakfast. In the kitchen I usually   
 find my mum preparing my packed lunch.
 After breakfast I go to school. At    
 school I play a few games before I go 
 into the class at 8.55. In class we   
 read until assembly and after that we 
 do maths. In the middle of maths we go
 out to play. After play we do some    
 more maths and some English. At 12.00 
 we have dinner followed by dinner     
 play. When we come back in we do all  
 sorts of different things, such as    
 English, reading and self-chosen      
 study. My study is aircraft. When we  
 have done all this we go out to play. 
 After play we read and the teacher    
 reads to us until home time.          </content>
