<title>28A day in the life.</title>
<content>

Saturday 11th June 2011&lt;br />&lt;br />Today I woke up and I just realised it was the Summer Fair today so I hurried to the bathroom and brushed my teeth and had a shower and quickly ate my breakfast. I got dressed and got my money out for the games.&lt;br />&lt;br />When I got to the fair I saw Simona and said hello.  I entered her competition then I got hungry and I went and bought a burger. Next I went on the bouncy castle, I fell off a couple of times but it was fun.&lt;br />&lt;br />Next I saw Elliot win a coconut so I thought I`d win one too then I sat down because I was running around too much. Then we went home.&lt;br />&lt;br />I really enjoyed this day.  &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
