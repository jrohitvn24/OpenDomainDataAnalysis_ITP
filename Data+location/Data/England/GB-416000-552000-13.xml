		<content> In 1961 Stanley Civic Hall was opened 
 by Joseph.P.Charlton.Inside the Civic 
 Hall are four studios.In all studios  
 films are shown,pantomimes, rehersals 
 and dancing classes are held.Separate 
 functions are held upstairs,such as   
 parties,weddings and discos.There is  
 also a bar which is well frequented.  
 Viewers dropped by approxumately 50   
 people per night when the video       
 recorders were brought out.However all
 new films are not available in video  
 shops and between 500 and 600 people  
 per night have been known to attend   
 the Civic Hall to see films not       
 released on video tape.Four years     
 later on the 21st of August 1965 the  
 Stanley Swimming and Turkish baths was
 opened by Councillor Jolly.The baths  
 have one large swimming pool,one small
 swimming pool,a low diving board and  
 high board.                           </content>
