		<title>14HOUSING IN HADFIELD 1</title>
		<content> A walk through Hadfield showed a      
 variety of housing to pupils of class 
 2M of St Andrews School, Hadfield.    
   The first part of the walk was      
 through the housing estate where most 
 of the houses were made of brick. The 
 new houses were built about 1965. They
 were mainly terraced houses. They had 
 little ginnels between the houses. The
 roofs were of slate. Some houses had  
 gardens at the front and back. Some   
 others only had back gardens. Others  
 had little walls with privets behind  
 them. Most houses were terraced houses
 because instead of having twelve walls
 there would only be seven walls which 
 saved time, work and bricks. You can  
 have one wall for the side of two     
 houses.                               
   We saw a lot of open space and in   
 one of the open spaces we saw St      
 Charles Church which is quite old.    </content>
