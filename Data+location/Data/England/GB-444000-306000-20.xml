		<content> Only one person out of the 72 did not 
 use the shops at all.We feel the shops
 are vitally important to our village  
 We asked some people how long they    
 had lived in Thornton.less than 5     
 years-20,less than 20 years-20,over 20
 years -28.The older people have lived 
 here all their lives,but now there is 
 a new group who have moved to Thornton
 to live in the new houses.We did a    
 traffic survey for four hours         
 cars-266,bikes-36,vans-46,            
 buss-5,people-126,lorrys-11,.We think 
 that the traffic is not unusual but   
 that number of pedestrians shows it to
 be a very lively village.
