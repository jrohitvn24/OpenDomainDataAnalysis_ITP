		<title>05BOXFORD CHURCH</title>
		<content>Boxford Church is 500 years old and    
some of the church is cracking and     
falling down so there is scaffolding   
around the church because it is being  
restored.                              
                                       
There are new windows being put in.    
They are putting new stone around the  
windows.  It costs 1,500 pounds to     
repair a window.                       
                                       
The oldest grave was made in 1590 so it
is nearly 400 years old.  There are two
sundials on top of the church.  There  
are nine doors and a trap door on the  
roof.  On average there are three      
marriages each year, ten christenings, 
eight or ten burials.  There is a Holy 
Communion at 8.00 a.m. and a service at
10.30 a.m. for morning prayer every    
Sunday.                                
                                       </content>
