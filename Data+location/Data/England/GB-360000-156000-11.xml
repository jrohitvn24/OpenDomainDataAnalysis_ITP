		<title>11Cameley Mill i</title>
		<content> Cameley Mill was built over 300 years 
 ago.Water from the River Cam was      
 collected in a pond,then used to drive
 the mill wheel.In addition to milling 
 corn part of the building may have    
 been used as a dairy and cheese       
 factory.The building is made of       
 Pennant Stone and White Lias.It has   
 many low beams,and small rooms leading
 of one another.Many of the doorways   
 were extremely low,some only 4 feet   
 high.The first known owners of the    
 mill were the Hippesley family.In 1919
 it was sold to John Joseph Abbott who 
 used it as a 150 acre dairy farm,and  
 the mill became a dwelling house.Since
 1923 the mill has been owned by 3     
 generations of the Blacker family.
