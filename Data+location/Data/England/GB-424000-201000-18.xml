		<title>18Milk and Beef in Langford.</title>
		<content>  On this farm in the area the farmer  
has a herd of 60 fresian cows 50 of    
which are milking. His herd produces   
over 800 litres of milk every week.The 
milk is collected by tanker each day.  
The milk is taken to Wantage where it  
is used to make cream and yoghurt in   
the dairy there.                       
  He has about 50 head of cattle which 
he rears for beef. Early in 1985 an    
average sized animal would sell for    
about 500 pounds.                      
  The farmer puts the manure from the  
animals by the side of the fields. This
is done so that when the crops have    
been cut it can be spread over the     
fields. This helps the crops grow the  
next year.
