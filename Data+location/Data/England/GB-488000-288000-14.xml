		<title>14Highland Gathering, Corby.</title>
		<content>Corby is one of the few places outside 
Scotland that has an annual gathering  
of the clans. Due to the large number  
of Scots in the population and the many
family links a traditional Highland    
Gathering became a popular annual event
in the 1970's and has continued since. 
It is held over one week-end, usually  
in July at the Welfare Ground, the     
original recreational ground built for 
the steelworkers.                      
The first day of the event has Scottish
dancing and pipe band championships    
during the day and in the afternoon    
there are traditional athletics events,
such as tossing the caber and throwing 
the hammer. These are both well        
attended by national and international 
teams. Several years ago the World Pipe
Band Championship was hosted. The      
Sunday is a fun day, with displays,    
competitions and a funfair.            </content>
