		<content> The plant employs no preserving       
 technique except for freezing and     
 packing.  After the meat has matured  
 it is placed in the blast freezer.  It
 costs Â£6 per hour to run the 2        
 machines which cost Â£80 000 each.  The
 meat turns very hard and grey in      
 colour.                               
 After the meat has passed through some
 more processing procedures, it is     
 packed into bags and taken to the cold
 store where the temperature can reach 
 -40 degrees Celsius.  Orange lights   
 have been installed to make the       
 workers feel warmer because they often
 have to stay inside for half an hour. 
 The owner had to plant trees round the
 plant to avoid possible complaints    
 from local residents.  At present     
 there are 54 workers.  Expansion is   
 planned but this involves moving to   
 Winsford.                             </content>
