		<title>14My life in Cheshunt</title>
		<content>My house in Cheshunt is spacious and   
modern.It has a small kitchen and a    
large living room.                     
My family are rather close on my dad's 
side,but I've hardly seen any family   
on my mum's side because they all live 
in Wales.I am one sixteenth welsh.     
I get up at about seven o'clock on     
weekdays but about nine or ten on      
weekends.On weekdays I go to Turnford  
School.It is rather good.On Saturday I 
go down to Waltham Cross and on        
Sundays I see my dad.My dad doesn't    
have any pets but we have a black cat  
called Sooty and he is seven years     
old. In the evenings I normally watch  
the television to relax after school   
but sometimes I play out with my       
friends.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
