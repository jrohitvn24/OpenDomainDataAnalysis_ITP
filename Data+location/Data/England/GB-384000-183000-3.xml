		<content>  A lot of people think that our       
 standards of{behaviour}as a nation are
 declining so we asked a group of 46   
 parents what they thought. They       
 agreed, with one exception.The major  
 causes cited were too much{violence}on
{T.V,} and too little{home}discipline. 
{School}discipline was thought to be a 
 factor by about half the group, but   
 inspite of the recent football riots  
 at the Belgian Heysel stadium only a  
 quarter thought{alcohol}was to        
 blame. Poor{church}attendance was not 
 a major factor and again despite the  
 winter's coalmine{strike}and the      
 current teacher's{strike}these also   
 were not thought to be of importance  
 in this field. A quarter thought that 
 greed and selfishness were factors and
 a fifth thought that{unemployment}    
 contributed.                          
                                       </content>
