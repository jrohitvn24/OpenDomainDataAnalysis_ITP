		<content> Shillingstone is in the heart of      
 Dorset and tourists are mainly the    
 middle to older age group.Many        
 overnight visitors are from abroad,   
 particularly Americans and            
 Australians who are tracing there     
 family trees.Interest in old crafts is
 very great,also.                      
 There are two main establishments     
 catering for tourists in              
 Shillingstone,in addition to pubs     
 throughout the area. they are the     
 Willow Tearooms,on the main Blandford 
 road,and Bere Marsh Cottage at the    
 opposite end of the village.Each      
 caters for around 40 people per       
 week in addition to around 100+       
 overnight visitors per season. Of     
 these,50% are passing to or from the  
 West country,40% visiting Dorset and  
 10% visiting local boarding schools.
