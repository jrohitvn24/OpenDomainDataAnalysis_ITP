		<title>04Richmond. The doctor.</title>
		<content> When I go to the doctors I feel a     
 sense of dread, that what I have got  
 is serious yet still I go on with     
 it. When I get to  the doctor's office
 I knock on his door and he says come  
 in so I do. When I'm in there         
 he tells me to lie down on the bed.   
 When I am on it he rolls my jumper    
 up and puts his stethascope on my     
 stomach and back, it is freezing      
 cold.Then I roll my jumper down       
 and he tells me to open my mouth      
 so I do. After that he gives me a     
 prescription.Then I go out and down to
 the chemist and get my medicine.Then  
 after that I go home.
