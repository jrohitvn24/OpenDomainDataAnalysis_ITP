		<content>                                       
   Dilhorne is a pleasant village of   
some sevenhundred inhabitants, lying   
approximately two miles north of Blythe
Bridge and two miles west of Cheadle,  
in the Leek and Moorlands area of the  
county of Staffordshire.               
The central point of the village is its
eleventh century church of All Saints, 
one of only seven churches in England  
with a octagonal tower.                
   The church is one of four religious 
buildings within the village, the      
others being Methodist Chapels. The    
four churches are matched by four      
Public Houses within the area.         
   The main Methodist Chapel is at     
Godley Brook and was errected through  
private donations and the formation of 
a charity in 1816.All the churches have
supported the work of the village      
school.                                </content>
