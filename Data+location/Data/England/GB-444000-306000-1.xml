		<title>01OUR AREA</title>
		<content> This is a rural area ,with two        
 villages.A geological fault bisects   
 the area,Bagworth to the N.lies on    
 Coalmeasures,while Thornton stands on 
 the ancient rocks of Charnwood Forest.
 The landscape,farming and character   
 of the built up area is dictated by   
 the geology.The Coalmeasures land     
 supports a more intensive form of     
 agriculture,and a varied industrial   
 base;two coalmines,one disused,a clay 
 quarry and brick yard and a number of 
 small manufacturing units.Unfortunatly
 the pop.of this Victorian village has 
 declined due to mining subsidence.In  
 contrast,Thornton is an old farming   
 community,which has expanded recently 
 into a dormitory village.The reservoir
 with its new car parks &amp; Trout Fishing
 now attracts many visitors.           
                                       
 It is an area of contrasts.           </content>
