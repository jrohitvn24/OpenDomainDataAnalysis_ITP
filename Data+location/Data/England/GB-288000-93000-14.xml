		<title>14THE  FARM  VISIT</title>
		<content>      On the{22nd May 1985}as part of  
 our Domesday Project we visited{Friars
{Ball Farm}which is in one of our      
 squares that we have to survey.       
 When we eventually got to the farm{Mr.
{Partridge}the farmer told us a lot of 
 information. We saw that he had quite 
 a lot of equipment and machinery.     
{Mr. Partridge}told us that because he 
 is a dairy farmer most of his animals 
 are cows and that most of his fields  
 are{intensively managed grassland}for 
 the cows to eat.{                     
{Intensively Managed grassland}is grass
 that is specially grown and fertilizer
 is put on it to make it grow nice and 
 luscious.{Mr. Partridge}told us that  
 there are three tractors and three    
 people working on the farm.{Mr.       
{Partridge}took us into his back garden
 where we could see more fields that   
 belonged to the farm.                 </content>
