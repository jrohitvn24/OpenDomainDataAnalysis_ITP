		<title>07UNEMPLOYMENT-SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content>We thought that the most serious social
concern of 1985 was unemployment       
118,803 people alone in Birmingham are 
without a job.1590 of them in Ladywood 
We decided to look at one the 118,803  
and find out his hopes and fears for   
the future.We will call the person John
for convenience.                       
  John has been unemployed for 3 years.
He had been sacked from his job as a   
Telephone Operator.He spends his days  
cooking,cleaning and washing.He never  
visits the Job Centre but looks in the 
newspaper for work instead.            
  His biggest problem is that he has a 
wife and three children.His hopes for  
the future in his own words are  "to   
get another job or win the pools or    
something",but that is very unlikely   
and his job prospects are very gloomy.
