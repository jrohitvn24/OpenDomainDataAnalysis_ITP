 Moreton Bowling Club started its first
 match on the 9th of June,they set off 
 for Morchard Bishop full of           
 enthusiasm.The 11 members thoroughly  
 enjoyed their visit. Although they    
 lost,(as they expected),they came home
 determined to play as soon as possible
 again.The following week the team was 
 entertained by Chagford, and this     
 again proved to be a most enjoyable   
 occation, with a full Moreton team of 
 twelve being fielded.Chagford club has
 most kindly offered its green for our 
 bowlers to use any Tuesday or Thursday
 and this invitation is greatly        
 appreciated.                          </content>
