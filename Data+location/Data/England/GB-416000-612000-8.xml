		<title>08QUEENIE, QUEENIE</title>
		<content> We play Queenie, Queenie in the       
 playground.  It is a game that girls  
 and boys can play.  It has a rhyme to 
 go with it.  It is a game any amount  
 of children can play. The children are
 in a line and there is a person on.   
 We 'Dips' to see who is on.  The      
 person who is on stands somewhere in  
 the playground and the other people   
 stand behind the person that is on.   
 The person that is on has his back to 
 the other people.  He or she throws   
 the ball and someone has to catch it. 
 When they have caught it they sing a  
 rhyme:  Queenie, Queenie,             
         Who's got the ball?           
         I haven't got it              
         It isn't in my pocket         
         Queenie, Queenie, Who's got   
         the ball?                     
 If the person that is on chooses the  
 right person they are on.             </content>
