		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE(continued)</title>
		<content> We play a{game}of cricket with my two 
 younger brothers and later we decide  
 to go for a walk in the woods.There we
 make a den with some sticks and ferns,
 playing Cops and Robbers in it.By this
 time Mum shouts that it is tea-time.My
 friend's mother comes to collect him. 
 My favourite T.V. programme The A Team
 is about to begin so I sit down in the
 armchair to watch it.There is a new   
 and exciting story every week.About 8 
 o'clock I go for my bath and mum makes
 me a nice hot cup of Ovaltine before  
 I go to bed. While I am sipping my    
 bed-time drink I think about the      
 enjoyable day I have just had.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
