		<title>09Black Dam Nature Reserve</title>
		<content>{Black Dam Nature Reserve}on the east  
 side of Basingstoke close to the M3   
 motorway was set aside for people to  
 learn about nature.It has a wide      
 variety of animals such as rabbits,   
 moles and squirrels.It has a large    
 variety of birds including spotted fly
 catchers, wrens and rooks. It has     
 reptiles and amphibians including the 
 great crested newt. In Victorian times
 the chalk stream was a watercress bed 
 but now the stream has only false     
 watercress. By the side of the stream 
 grows the poisonous, imported North   
 American giant hogweed. A rare plant  
 called the twayblade grows here too.  
 Our class visited the reserve and we  
 observed lots of fresh water shrimps  
 and snails eggs. It is used a lot by  
 local people.
