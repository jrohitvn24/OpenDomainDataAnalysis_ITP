		<content>{SINBAD}(Part 1) by Richard Hobbs      
   Sinbad watched the ship vanish      
 between the sky and the deep blue sea.
 He walked along, sad, hot and tired.  
 The vegetation seemed to be alive.    
 Bushes were swaying, yet there was no 
 wind. As Sinbad approached the jungle,
 he heard a rustling sound. Then, as he
 turned, an arrow creased his shoulder 
 and stuck in a tall tree. He plucked  
 the firmly-placed arrow from its      
 position in the bark.                 
   Puzzled, Sinbad turned, only to see 
 that the bush from which the arrow had
 come had disappeared. He used the     
 arrow as his first spear. He walked   
 cautiously towards a bush that seemed 
 to be moving.                         
   As he drew closer, he noticed that  
 the bush had stopped. It rose,        
 revealing an ugly face. Sinbad tried  
 to explain that he was a friend.      </content>
