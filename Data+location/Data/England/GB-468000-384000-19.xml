		<title>19Water-Skiing, Lound</title>
		<content> Lound Water Ski Club has two lakes.   
 They were made from an old gravel     
 quarry especially for top-class water 
 skiing.  One lake is round and is used
 for leisure skiing and the other lake 
 is long and is used for competitions. 
 The water in both lakes varies from   
 six to twelve feet deep.  The club has
 over a hundred members, some          
 travelling a hundred miles.  Some of  
 the British Water Ski team are members
 of the club.  People bring caravans   
 and stay overnight on the site.  They 
 have discos and barbecues in the      
 summer.  There are three kinds of     
 skiing - slalom, ski jumping and trick
 skiing.  You can start skiing when you
 are three years old.  You start on two
 wooden skiis and then, when  you      
 improve, you use one ski.  As well as 
 skis you need a wet suit, a ski vest, 
 a ski rope and a crash helmet.        </content>
