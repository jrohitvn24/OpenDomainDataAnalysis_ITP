		<title>03N Plumstead Common: 05430178</title>
		<content> The north of the block is bordered by 
 Plumstead Road, an ancient route      
 dating from Saxon times. It separates 
 the former marshland to the north from
 the higher land to the south. Heavy   
 traffic on this road has long been a  
 problem but extensive roadworks at    
 present underway should ease the      
 congestion. The area has been densely 
 populated since Victorian times and   
 many of the houses built then were for
 the workers at the nearby Woolwich    
 Arsenal. In the 1960s and 1970s lots  
 of old houses were demolished to make 
 way for blocks of flats &amp; mainsonettes
 More recent building has seen a return
 to popular two storey terraces. The   
 area has an increasing population and 
 in the last 15 years there has been   
 one new primary school and a second   
 building for another. Many people     
 commute daily to central London.      </content>
