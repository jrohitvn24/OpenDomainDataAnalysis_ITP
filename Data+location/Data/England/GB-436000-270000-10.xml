		<title>10Conservation at Ryton</title>
		<content> The establishing of this conservation 
 area came about following the         
 conclusion of gravel excavation and   
 landfill.The site is monitored by the 
 Warks Nature Conservation Trust.      
 Ryton Pool is located south east of   
 Bubbenhall village.The pool is a      
 disused gravel pit transformed into a 
 nature reserve.The pool attracts many 
 types of wildlife.Many breeds of water
 birds inhabit the centre island in the
 pool including Canada geese,coots and 
 two types of duck.Sand martins make   
 their nests in the banks as the sand  
 from the excavations is still there   
 .A number of butterflies and insects  
 also live on the nature reserve       
 including the Common blue butterfly   
 and the small copper.Dragonflies can  
 sometimes be seen in the summer.To    
 fish in Ryton pool is prohibited      
 unless you have a permit.             </content>
