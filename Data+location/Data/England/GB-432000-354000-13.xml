		<content> Most houses in Crich are built of     
 Derbyshire stone,roofed with stone    
 tiles,slates or clay tiles.Some of the
 newer houses are built with brick or  
 reconstituted stone.                  
 Here are 2 different types of house   
 owned by the families of 2 fourth year
 Crich pupils.                         
{BOY ONE}_My house is 7 years 9 months 
 old.It is built out of reconstituted  
 stone with a concrete - tiled roof.We 
 are on our second extension already.  
{BOY TWO} _ My house is about 300 years
 old and is built of sandstone.The roof
 is of slate but the barn roof is tiles
 and stone slabs.Outside there is a    
 well about 25 feet deep and at the    
 bottom there is supposed to be a pot  
 of gold sovereigns.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
