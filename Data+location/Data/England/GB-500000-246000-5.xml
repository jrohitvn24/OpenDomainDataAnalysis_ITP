 Now with its three aisles, stained    
 glass windows and wood carvings, it is
 a beautiful light church attended by  
 over a hundred people at the three    
{Sunday services.}About fifty children 
 go to{Sunday School.}An experienced   
 team ring the 10 bells, an organist   
 and choir lead the worship and flower 
 arrangements and beautiful embroidery 
 decorate the church.

 baptisms, weddings and funerals,
