		<content> Household cleaning and repairs are    
 mostly done by home members but some  
 of the elderly have outside help.     
 preparation and serving meals occupies
 much time.  Home baking is more       
 popular than purchasung pre-packed    
 frozen meals and most homes find      
 freezers invaluable.                  
 All homes have gardens which are well 
 cared for and colourful, Grass is kept
 mowed, hedges clipped and vegetable   
 patches cultivated to produce         
 household needs. Dogs and cats are the
 usual pets which require grooming,    
 exercise and feeding.                 
 Relatives and friends to a meal or    
 longer visit is very popular. In the  
 home time is spent relaxing watching  
 favourite television programmes       
 playing with children orparticipationg
 in women's crafts and men's hobbies.
