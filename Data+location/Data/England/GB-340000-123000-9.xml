 In our area of Somerset,apple growing 
 provides seasonal employment to local 
 women.My Mum works at a fruit_farm    
 from September to April.For the rest  
 of the year she is out of work.The    
 apples are picked in the Autumn.They  
 are put into large bins and then put  
 into cold_store to keep fresh.        
 One_by_one the bins are removed       
 and the apples washed.In a special    
 machine the leaves and twigs are      
 removed and then the apples are ready 
 for grading.Undersized apples are used
 to make cider.The apples are then     
 packed into boxes and returned to the 
 cold_store.Class 1 apples are sent to 
 all parts of the country and          
 especially to London.In the Winter the
 trees are pruned to ensure a good crop
 the following year.
