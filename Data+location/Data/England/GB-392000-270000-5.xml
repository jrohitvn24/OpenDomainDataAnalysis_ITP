		<title>05SANDERS PARK, BROMSGROVE-1</title>
		<content>  {Sanders Park}was given to Bromsgrove
 in 1910. It was given by the daughters
 of{Benjamin Hadley Sanders}in memory  
 of him. He had been the clerk of the  
 Bromsgrove Local Board for 50 years.  
    In the middle of the park there is 
 a pond with an island in the centre.  
 This is ideal for a radio controlled  
 boat,because you can go around the    
 island. It also has some small fish in
 the water. There are trees,shrubs and 
 flowers which make the park look      
 colourful, and there are lots of      
 benches for people to sit and rest.   
    Next to the car park there is a    
 doggy toilet but I've never seen a dog
 use it yet. At weekends there is a    
 kiosk where you can buy ice-creams and
 refreshments.
