		<title>10FARMING IN IDRIDGEHAY</title>
		<content> In Idridgehay high rainfall makes     
 grass grow well.The grass is eaten by 
 cows.In summer we cut the grass for   
 silage and hay for winter feed.In     
 summer farmers strip graze.Strip      
 grazing makes the cows eat grass      
 economically.The farmers divide the   
 field with a movable electric fence.  
 When the cows have eaten the grass in 
 one area the electric fence is moved  
 to let them into another part of the  
 field.The cows are mainly for milk.   
 Some people in Idridgehay faten cows  
 for meat.Most people in Idridgehay    
 have modern milking parlours.The milk 
 is sold to the Milk Marketing Board.  
 This year the price is l5p a litre.   
 Recently farmers have started growing 
 potatoes, barley and wheat.This is to 
 conform with the European Economic    
 Communities' plan to reduce milk      
 production.                           </content>
