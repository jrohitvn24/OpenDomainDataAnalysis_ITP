		<content> A main road runs from Bolton town     
 centre to the Royal Oak at            
 Bradshaw.From there the roads go to   
 Blackburn,Burnley and Bury.Traffic    
 jams occur in the morning and at night
 as people living in the area tend to  
 commute to nearby towns for work.     
 The ring road,Crompton Way,which was  
 built in the 1920's and takes traffic 
 around the north side of Bolton,cuts  
 across the main road and adds to the  
 traffic congestion.                   
 Many of the other roads,especially in 
 the north of the area,are little more 
 than country roads or tracks and they 
 have steep gradients and difficult    
 bends.Bus services are adequate during
 the day but poor at night.The         
 Manchester-Bolton railway             
 line runs through the area with a     
 station at Bromley Cross catering     
 mostly for commuters.                 </content>
