		<title>12LEE MOOR AREA-FARMING.</title>
		<content> The area is on the edge of Dartmoor   
 and the type of farming which goes on 
 tends to be of a moorland nature.There
 are many sheep roaming around the     
 china clay workings.These are mainly  
 kept for their wool.The sheep are not 
 fenced in and are able to wander onto 
 the roads,which leads to some of them 
 being killed by motor vehicles.There  
 are also a few moorland cattle kept in
 the area,grown for their meat.The     
 quality of the grass in the area is   
 not generally good enough for dairy   
 cattle to be kept.There are a few     
 Dartmoor ponies in the area which when
 old enough are sold at auction for    
 riding.There is a riding stable at    
 Tinpark Farm.The soil is not generally
 good enough for arable crops to be    
 grown,although the soil is better on  
 the lower slopes.
