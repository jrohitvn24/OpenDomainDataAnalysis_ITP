		<title>03Homeless in Brighton</title>
		<content> Brighton has a serious housing        
 problem, with 1500 people in bed and  
 breakast accomodation, 200 people     
 sleeping rough, 40 people in the      
 resettlement unit and about 1500      
 families are on the Council housing   
 waiting list.                         
 Brighton Housing Trust, a charity,    
 organises a nightly soup run on the   
 seafront for people sleeping rough.   
 The number of homeless people is      
 expected to increase considerably as a
 result of the latest government ruling
 which requires unemployed people under
 the age of 26 living in bed and       
 breakfast accomodation to move out of 
 the travel_to_work area after every   
 two weeks.                            
 Homeless people suffer from a         
 complexity of problems: poverty,      
 unemployment, sometimes drug abuse and
 alcoholism.The other side of Brighton!</content>
