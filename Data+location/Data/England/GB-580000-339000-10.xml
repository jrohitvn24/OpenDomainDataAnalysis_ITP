		<title>10TRANSPORT IN BURNHAM MARKET</title>
		<content>    The Eastern Counties bus company,  
 part of the National Bus Company, has 
 withdrawn village services in the past
 few years: its only remaining service 
 through our area is the "Coastliner"  
 service which runs from King's Lynn   
 to Lowestoft in the summer months.    
 Burnham Market now relies on          
 independent bus companies which       
 operate services to Wells, Hunstanton,
 Fakenham and King's Lynn. The         
 community mini-bus service takes      
 pensioners to Wells twice per month   
 and Age Concern operates a service to 
 Fakenham weekly. Many people have     
 their own cars and there is a garage/ 
 filling station in the survey area    
 which also retails and services       
 vehicles. The railway line to         
 Burnham Market was closed in the early
 1960's and now the nearest railway    
 station is at King's Lynn.            </content>
