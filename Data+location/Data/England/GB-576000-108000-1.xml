		<title>01Southern St.Leonards/Pebsham</title>
		<content> The area covered comprises southern   
 St.Leonard's-on-Sea,the rural area    
 west of this,some of which is very    
 low-lying and marshy,and the eastern  
 part of Pebsham estate.The southern   
 area is the English Channel,abutting  
 the urban coastal strip from De La    
 Warr Road in the west to Marine Court 
 flats in the east via Glyne Gap,      
 Bulverhythe and Marina.Roughly half is
 urban,half rural,with most houses in  
 the east and south of the area.These  
 vary in age and type.Very few now     
 standing were built before Victorian  
 times,except those near St.Leonard's  
 town centre.Many are 20th.century.    
 Development continues.Prices are      
 relatively low as jobs are short and  
 road and rail links with London and   
 other population centres are          
 comparatively poor.Some woodland      
 survives in the north of the area.    </content>
