{A CHILDS VIEW OF WHAT GOES ON IN      
{TODMORDEN.                            
   I like Todmorden.It has a park with 
 swings and a climbing frame.In May    
 there is a Carnival.In June there is  
 an Agricultural Show.In August there  
 is a Soap Box Derby.We have a St. John
 Ambulance Brigade.We have Brownies,   
 Guides, Cub Scouts and Scouts.We also 
 have a Brass Band.The well known      
 Operatic Society and Todmorden Players
 put on shows at the Hippodrome        
 Theatre, and there is a Gang Show     
 every year.There is a Cricket Club and
 lots of football teams.In August      
 everyone joins in a Pram Race.At      
 Christmas we have carol singing round 
 a Christmas tree near the Town Hall.
