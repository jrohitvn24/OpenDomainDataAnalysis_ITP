		<title>12A HOUSEWIFE'S STORY</title>
		<content>   I have lived here for five years. I 
 have previously lived in three houses 
 and two flats. I get up at 8 o'clock  
 on weekdays and 9 o'clock at weekends.
 I dress, and make breakfast for the   
 two girls and take them to school. I  
 have mine with my husband later. We   
 have toast or bacon and egg and a     
 drink of coffee.                      
   I wash the clothes three times a    
 week in the washer. I help my husband 
 in the garden. We grow vegetables and 
 fruit. I go shopping to Sherburn and  
 Garforth every Friday at 10.30am. I   
 might go to the village shop now and  
 again. I clean the house every day and
 wash the dishes.                      
   Dinner is at twelve noon for my     
 husband, little girl and me. At five  
 o'clock we all have tea.
