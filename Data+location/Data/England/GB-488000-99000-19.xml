		<content> The roads in this area are minor      
 roads,usually only one lane in each   
 direction.There are far more cars than
 lorries on the roads here because it  
 is a more residential than industrial 
 area.Lorries come here mainly to      
 deliver goods,such as food and other  
 stock for shops,and building          
 materials.Large articulated lorries   
 are rarely seen.Journeys to work and  
 for shopping are usually taken by car,
 the largest number coming from        
 Pagham. Bus services are very         
 restricted.A school bus is available  
 for older children attending school in
 Chichester.Bicycles are popular with  
 all age groups.
