		<title>13FARMING METHODS, HOLBERROW</title>
		<content> Approximately 10 of the farms in the  
 area are working.  Of those more are  
 owned than worked by tenant farmers,  
 the majority by families who          
 occasionally employ a farm worker     
 often on dairy farms where a relief   
 milker is a necessity.  The present   
 day trend indicates that the farm may 
 not necessarily be inherited by the   
 children.  Most farmers are connected 
 to the National Farmers Union.        
 Mechanical farm machinery varies but  
 includes tractors, balers (for both   
 oblong and the modern round bale),    
 numerous ploughs, drills and grain    
 dryers.  Some farmers do contract work
 for others in the area, few own such  
 large equipment as combine harvesters 
 and these are usually hired at harvest
 time.  An inherited knowledge is used 
 to repair machinery and farmers keep a
 variety of medication for emergencies.</content>
