		<title>09A day in my life</title>
		<content> I go downstairs to the kitchen for my 
 breakfast. Whilst I eat my breakfast I
 watch the Popeye cartoon on the       
 television.For breakfast I normally   
 have a bowl of cornflakes and a fried 
 egg on toast.My mum,dad and brother   
 have cereal and toast and jam..After  
 breakfast I help mum clear up and then
 go into the lounge and have a game of 
 snooker.Half way through my second    
 game my mum shouts down to me,"Simon  
 the bathroom is empty." So I run      
 upstairs to the bathroom where I clean
 my teeth.It is now about 8 O clock.My 
 dad backs his car out of the path and 
 my mum backs hers out of the garage.I 
 have to leave my house 8.15a.m.because
 my mum and dad have to go to work and 
 my brother has to go to school.I say  
 goodbye to everyone and start walking 
 down the road to a house where I have 
 to stay until it is time for school.  </content>
