		<content>Children in Swindon play a lot of games
just like children all over the world. 
They play games in their gardens and   
roller-skate in the street.Children    
enjoy football and tennis.Cricket is   
played on the large school field and   
tick is played behind the P.E.shed.    
Netball,volleyball,skipping and        
hopscotch are played as well.          
The children in Swindon play in almost 
any safe place at all,playing fields,  
parks,open spaces and their own        
garden.                                
Children enjoy volleyball where there  
is a high rope or net.Two teams have to
throw the ball over the net and if the 
other team cannot return it they get a 
point.
