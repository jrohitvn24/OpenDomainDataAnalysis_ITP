 THE HALL IS IN THE ATTRACTIVE HAMLET  
 OF COWLEY AND STANDS ABOUT HALF A MILE
 TO THE EAST OF CARTLEDGE HALL.UNTIL   
 RECENTLY THE HALL HAD SOME OF ITS OLD 
 OUTBUILDINGS STILL STANDING BUT IT HAS
 BEEN ALTERED AND MODERNISED SEVERAL   
 TIMES DURING ITS LONG LIFE,THE FRONT  
 OF THE BUILDING SUGGESTING IT IS EARLY
 19TH CENTURY.AT VARIOUS SITES ALONG   
 COWLEY LANE BEFORE ITS STEEP DROP TO  
 THE BROOK ARE VERY OLD FARMHOUSES,THE 
 MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN RENOVATED 
 AND RESTORED TO THEIR ORIGINAL STYLE. 
 COWLEY GRANGE FARM STANDS ONLY A SHORT
 DISTANCE AWAY AND IS ANOTHER FORMER   
 ECCLESIASTICAL GRANGE.
