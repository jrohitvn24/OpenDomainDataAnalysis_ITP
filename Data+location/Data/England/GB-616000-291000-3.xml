		<content> The region has one area of high       
 development i.e.the village of Long   
 Stratton, which is situated on both   
 sides of the main A140 trunk road.    
 This road was built by the Romans as a
 main route from Norwich to Ipswich.   
 Therefore the village has become a    
 very convenient position for people to
 live who need to travel to Norwich (9 
 miles), and it has become a commuter  
 village, with a population of 2,304.  
 The other parish in the area is       
 Wacton. This village has a population 
 of 259.                               
 Part of the parish of Forncett forms  
 the remains of the area.
