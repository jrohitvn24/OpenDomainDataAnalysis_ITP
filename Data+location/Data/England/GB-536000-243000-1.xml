		<content>  The topography is flat, beginning to 
 roll gently away from the S. E.       
 corner. The combined population of the
 villages{is approximately 7,000.  They
{are mentioned in Domesday and contain 
{an interesting cross section of       
{buildings dating from the twelfth     
{century.  Their situation vis-a-vis   
{communications by road and railway is 
{good, which has led to considerable   
{residential and light industrial      
{development during the past fifteen   
{years also to a 'dormitory to London' 
{situation.  A main road bye-pass is   
{urgently needed by Melbourne, the     
{result of a Public Enquiry into which 
{will be published shortly.  Melbourn  
{is the focal point for a number of    
{villages in South Cambridgeshire,     
{praticularly through the Village      
{College amenities.
