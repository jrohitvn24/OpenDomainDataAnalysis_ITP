		<title>16BEKESBOURNE RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> The railway runs through Bekesbourne. 
 There is a foot bridge across the     
 railway. The station has no people    
 working there but people catch trains 
 there. It is going to be repainted,   
 even though no one works there.       
 We looked at the time table and found 
 that  Monday to Friday 23 trains go to
 London and 23 trains go to Dover.     
 On Saturdays 18 trains go to London   
 and 20 trains go to Dover.On Sundays  
 17 trains go to London and 19 trains  
 go to Dover.The first train to London 
 leaves Bekesbourne at 6.22 and the    
 last train leaves at 22.38. The first 
 train to Dover leaves at 6.39 and the 
 last train leaves at 23.48.We saw a   
 train going to London at 12.38 and a  
 train going to Dover at 12.45.        
 We found out that 53 relatives of     
 children at Bridge School use the     
 station at Bekesbourne.               </content>
