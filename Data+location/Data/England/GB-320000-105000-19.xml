		<title>19People in the Upottery Area</title>
		<content> As we have a number of farms in the   
 area a lot of people live and work on 
 farms or have jobs connected with     
 farming.For example one person sells  
 special feeds to farms in East Devon, 
 another mends machinery.There are     
 other types of work too:several       
 builders ,an architect and even an    
 agent for computers.                  
  A large proportion have lived in the 
 area virtually all their lives or have
 moved only a short distance from other
 parts of the county or from Somerset  
 which is very near.                   
    Quite a lot of people have moved   
 into the area either to work or when  
 they have retired.We found that many  
 of the newcomers had previously lived 
 in the Southern counties of England   
 and many came from London.Several said
 that they had moved expecting to find 
 a better quality of life in this area.</content>
