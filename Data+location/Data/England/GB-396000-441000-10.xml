		<title>10INDUSTRY MUSHROOM FARMING</title>
		<content>{A&amp;W MUSHROOMS                         
 Mr.Whittingham started growing        
 mushrooms two years ago after leaving 
 his other job.His farm is in two sheds
 which used to be for chickens.He      
 decided to see if he could grow       
 mushrooms for profit because he was   
 interested in them when he was        
 young.He now grows 48,000 pounds each 
 year.It takes 8 to 10 weeks to grow   
 them from bags which contain the      
 spawn,lime,peat,compost and feeder.   
 They need lots of water and a constant
 high temperature.Mr.Whittingham grows 
 button mushrooms(Agricus Bipsorus).   
 They are sold to wholesalers in       
 Keighley and to some small shops.He   
 has a part-time helper and the        
 mushrooms are packed into 3 pound     
 boxes.Mr.Whittingham thinks it is best
 for anyone wanting to grow mushrooms  
 to work for someone else first.       </content>
