		<title>01The Area in General.</title>
		<content>    The majority of the area covered   
 is owned by{The Army}who let local    
 farmers rent it for crops and         
 grazing.It is known locally as{The    
{Range}and many people walk or ride    
 horses out there.The fields are about 
 4 acres and are bounded by hedgerows. 
 There are small patches of woodland of
 mostly planted trees with very few    
 indigenous ones.                      
    Parts of Durrington,a fairly large 
 village were included.The village has 
 no centre and has grown a lot during  
 the last five years.THe population at 
 present is about 6000 people.         
    The other built up area is Carter  
 Barracks.This contained numerous Army 
 Buildings and Housing.                
    The{River Avon}flows through the   
 area with a tributary known as the    
 Nine Mile River.In many parts the     
 landscape is very picturesque.        </content>
