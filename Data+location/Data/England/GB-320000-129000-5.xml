		<title>05KINGSTON ST. MARY CHURCH</title>
		<content> The fine tower is like many in        
 Somerset. It was built in 1490 in red 
 sandstone. In the corners of the      
 tower,there are ugly creatures which  
 are called 'hunky punks'.The ground   
 floor is used as a vestry.            
   In the South aisle there is a huge  
 tomb.It was built in 1380 in honour of
 a warrior who settled near Kingston.  
   The church has many bench-ends made 
 of oak,one with a weavers' shuttle and
 other decorations of the sixteenth    
 century.                              
   The porch holds a statue of the     
 Virgin Mary,and the porch was built at
 the same time as the tower but the    
 statue is more recent.                
   The nave is quite plain apart from a
 large chandelier in the centre.       
   The chancel has the large east      
 window and dates back to the early    
 sixteenth century.                    </content>
