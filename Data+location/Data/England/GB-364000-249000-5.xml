		<content> There are no village schools in this  
 area and most children are taken by   
 bus to the schools in Bromyard, the   
 younger children attending St. Peter's
 primary and those of secondary age    
 attending the Queen Elizabeth High    
 school.  The children take their GCE  
 and/or CSE at this school, and those  
 who wish may then transfer to Hereford
 where they have the option of         
 attending the sixth form college, the 
 art college, or the technical college.
 Those who wish to study agriculture   
 attend the college at Holme Lacy,     
 which is about twenty miles away.     
 Some parents chose to send their      
 children to private and fee-paying    
 public schools. Adult education       
 classes are run by the LEA and WEA    
 in Bromyard.
