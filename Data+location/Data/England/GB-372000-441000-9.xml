		<title>09CLITHEROE MARKET</title>
		<content>    Clitheroe Market takes place every 
 Saturday and Tuesday. The roads become
 very busy on those days especially on 
 Saturdays.                            
    Most kinds of goods are sold,      
 fruit, vegetables, toys, sweets,      
 flowers and clothing. The stalls are  
 mainly brick with wooden 'flaps' that 
 fold away. The goods are loaded early 
 in the morning, then the buyers come  
 and it is then that it starts to      
 become busy.                          
    The stalls are built in rows with  
 room for about a car in between. On   
 non market days the market place is   
 deserted,  with only a few cars parked
 here and there. Now it is only used as
 a short cut by motorists.             
     After a busy Saturday or Tuesday  
 the stalls shutters are closed for    
 another two or three days.
