    In the centre of Long Lawford      
 stands a combined first and middle    
 school.This was founded by the Newbold
 Board of Education on the 15th of     
 January 1877.In 1961 a series of new  
 buildings were constructed in three   
 stages.14 years later a swimming pool 
 was built with money provided by the  
 Parent Teachers Association.Computers 
 and other sophisticated technological 
 equipment has been bought for the     
 school in the last 12 months.         
    At present the school has about 208
 pupils and 10 staff,which is liable to
 be lowered to 9 in the near           
 future.Children come to the school at 
 the age of 5 and leave at 12 having   
 taken the 12+ examination to decide   
 their future secondary school.
