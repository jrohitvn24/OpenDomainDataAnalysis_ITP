		<content> Since 1945 the electoral register of  
 Downderry has increased by 39% from   
 490 to 683.                           
  Most of this increase has been caused
 by the development of private estates,
 on the hillsides of Trerieve and      
 Bottlegate and the clifftop region at 
 Camps bay comprising now 48,20 and 15 
 houses respectively.Similar expansion 
 is seen in the provision of local     
 authority housing from 6 to 26.       
 In Seaton there has been development  
 on both sides of the river .In        
 particular the former market garden of
 the Heath family is replaced by the   
 Keveral Gardens Estate of 25 houses.  
  Services in the community have not   
 increased.Forty years ago there was an
 undertaker,a cobbler,a hardware store,
 a baker,a dispensing chemist.A doctor,
 a dentist,a postman were resident in  
 in the village .All have gone.        </content>
