		<content>{FARMLAND; THE DUNSMORE AREA           
 The agricultural land on the grid is  
 mainly situated in the valley which   
 runs along the dip slope of the       
 Chilterns bordering the main          
 London_Aylesbury road. There is also  
 farm land to the West of Coombe Hill, 
 which includes Dropshot Field which is
 an 100_acre field. The land is mainly 
 divided into small farms. Much of the 
 area is pasture and grazing land for  
 sheep, horses and cattle. The main    
 crops produced from the arable land   
 are Wheat and Barley. Some of the land
 at Russell Farm off the A413 has been 
 sold to provide land for small        
 businesses. An example of this is the 
 Emerald Conifer Nurseries which has   
 expanded rapidly over the last five   
 years. It now has a large selection of
 conifers and shrubs for sale.
