		<content>Tin Can Hoppit Someone counts to 50,   
 --------------all the rest hide. When 
he has counted he looks for you. If you
get caught one child can free people   
and the game goes on like that.        
Elastics You need a piece of elastic   
 ------  and three people. Two people  
hold the elastic round their ankles and
the other person jumps in and out.     
Skipping We play skipping. There are   
-------- all different rhymes. There   
is"I'm a little bumper car, number 72, 
And I went round the corner, I went    
down the hill, And I slammed on my     
brakes, But my brakes would not work,So
I went to the garage, How many gallons 
did it lose?" You count to a number and
when they miss they are out. There is  
also hopscotch skipping and a kind of  
running skipping and hopping skipping.
