		<content> Leybourne village school has been in  
 the local news recently. Parents      
 living on new estates in the area were
 dismayed to find that their children  
 would be unable to attend their local 
 school due to a shortage of staff and 
 accommodation. Instead places would be
 made available in nearby Larkfield    
 schools. Campaigning by parents and   
 governors for Leybourne school to be  
 enlarged has apparently met with some 
 success. A "Kent Messenger" headline  
 of July 5th 1985 states "Primary      
 school to get two new classrooms". The
 article states that an extra teacher  
 has been allocated to the school for a
 year from September. Parents are      
 hoping that a permanent solution to   
 the problem can soon be found.
