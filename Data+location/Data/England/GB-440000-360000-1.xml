		<title>01THE PILSLEY/TIBSHELF AREA</title>
		<content> The area covered by this survey is a  
 part of North East Derbyshire         
 including three villages, Pilsley,    
 Morton and part of Tibshelf.          
                                       
 Apart from its residential use, the   
 land is mainly agricultural, used     
 largely for growing cereal crops or   
 for pasture for dairy cattle.         
                                       
 The land is gently undulating in      
 character. The underlying rock        
 contains coal measures which have been
 exploited in the past, with coal mines
 in all three villages, open-cast      
 mining and a small oil well.          
                                       
 The source of the River Rother can be 
 found in the parish of Pilsley.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
