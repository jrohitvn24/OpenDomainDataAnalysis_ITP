		<title>06FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> My family's surname is Egerton. My Dad
 is an engineer at the local hospital  
 which is in Chichester. My mum also   
 works at the hospital, she is a nurse.
 I have a brother who is called Jason. 
 Both me and my brother are adopted. I 
 live in a house that has three        
 bedrooms. My bedroom is the smallest. 
 My parents are still paying for the   
 house. My house is in Deeside Avenue. 
 My brother goes to the Chichester Boys
 High School. Usually I get up at 6.30 
 a.m. and have breakfast at 7.00. I    
 start walking to school at 8.30. I get
 to school about five minutes later. I 
 get back from school at 4.00 p.m. My  
 favourite sport is cricket. I eat at  
 half-past five. When I have eaten my  
 tea I usually play Football and I     
 sometimes watch television. I usually 
 watch B.B.C. programmes.
