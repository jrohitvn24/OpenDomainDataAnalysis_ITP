		<title>05Police Force - Guisborough</title>
		<content> The police force of Guisborough       
 consists of 30 constables(6           
 females),8 sergeants(1 female) and 2  
 inspectors(1 female).                 
 A p.constable on foot patrol is not   
 expected to cover a specific distance 
 each day,but may cover up to 15 miles 
 per patrol and even more when covering
 another P.C's beat.Breaks are taken   
 every 3 to 4 hours.                   
    The P.C's work on a normal shift   
 basis,but each day there are a couple 
 of P.C's who work a cover beat of     
 16 hrs to ensure that at least one    
 person can relate the events of one   
 shift to the next P.C who is on duty. 
    Guisborough's police station       
 includes 2 male cells,1 female cell,1 
 8 man cell and 1 juvenile cell.       
    The main aim of Guisborough's      
 police is to keep the peace and       
 protect personal property.            </content>
