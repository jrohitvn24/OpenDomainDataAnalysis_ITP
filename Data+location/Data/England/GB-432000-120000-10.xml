		<content> The school is in a triangle between   
 the A31 Winchester - New Forest road, 
 the railway and the canal.  The road  
 to Winchester passes through Ampfield 
 Woods belonging to the Bishop of      
 Winchester until the 18th century when
 the road cut through the middle.      
 Before it was a very windy road       
 through Braishfield.  We counted the  
 traffic on this busy road over lots of
 five minutes (see charts 1 and 2).    
 The railway goes east to west.  On the
 east the railway splits one line      
 crossing the road over an old bridge  
 called the 'Sun Arch' after the inn.
