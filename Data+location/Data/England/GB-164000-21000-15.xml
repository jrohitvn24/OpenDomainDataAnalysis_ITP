		<title>15TRANSPORT IN CURY/GUNWALLOE</title>
		<content>     There are two minor roads that    
 pass through the area. One leaves the 
 main Helston/Lizard Road (A3083) near 
 the R.N.A.S Culdrose Sportsfields and 
 goes through Berepper/Gunwalloe       
 terminating at Church Cove. No through
 road except for cars which can cross a
 sandy path across Mullion Golf Course 
 and connect with the other road which 
 goes through to Mullion and the       
 Lizard.This other road leaves the     
 A3083 at Mainlay and passes through   
 the village of Cury. The villages of  
 Berepper/Gunwalloe have no Public     
 Transport and rely entirely on private
 transport. The village of Cury is more
 fortunate in having a through service 
 from Helston to the Lizard and return.
 This service comprises of three       
 coaches a day. Owing to schedules     
 available many residents use their own
 transport for convenience.            </content>
