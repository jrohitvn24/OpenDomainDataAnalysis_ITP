{ HUNTING}Beagle, fox hound &amp; buckhound
 packs hunt in the Forest as they have 
 done for centuries. The indigenous    
 rural population favours its          
 continuance, having a more practical  
 attitude to animal life &amp; having      
 possibly followed hounds on foot or on
 horseback since childhood. They have  
 also scathing views about the         
 disruptive anti-hunt saboteurs seen at
 meets. The middle class section is    
 more divided in opinion although      
 probably with a majority in favour of 
 its continuance, as would be expected 
 in an area which attracts those with  
 an interest in equestrianism, high    
 risk sport &amp; traditional customs.
