		<title>06Stythians Church, Stithians</title>
		<content> The Parish Church of St Stythians is  
 an active part of village life. It is 
 not known who St Stythian or Etienne  
 was or whether the saint was male or  
 female.The vicar conducts two services
 each Sunday (mainly Eucharists but    
 with Mattins once a month) as well as 
 other services including baptisms,    
 marriages and funerals.There were     
 eight burials so far this year and the
 vicar believes: "In Stithians more    
 people are being buried than          
 cremated". The site of the church as a
 place of worship, goes back to Celtic 
 times. Outside the churchyard is a    
 Celtic cross. Parts of the church are 
 quite old. The damaged Bodmin font is 
 12th century and the arches are 15th  
 and 13th centuries, but much of the   
 church was restored in the 19th       
 century. Some people worship in       
{Penmenor Methodist chapel.            </content>
