		<title>16MINSTHORPE FESTIVAL</title>
		<content>   I went to Minsthorpe Festival on    
 Sunday I marched in a parade from     
 South Kirby to Minsthorpe. There was  
 another parade from Upton, the cubs   
 walked with that one.I saw the mayor  
 and mayoress.There was a cub stall,   
 a brownie stall and a book stall.There
 was a play area with a bouncey, and a 
 fire engine that children could go on.
 There was a Punch and Judy show and a 
 spin the wheel game.                  
 There was a big skip with a clowns    
 face painted round it and people had  
 to kick a ball through his eyes or    
 mouth.                                
 There were some electronic aeroplanes 
 and helicopters and they had a fight.
