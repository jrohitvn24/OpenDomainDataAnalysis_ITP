		<title>19Why we came to live here</title>
		<content>   We used to live near{Warwick.}We    
 moved to{Derbyshire}because my dad    
 changed his job.                      
   We moved to{Duffield}because lots of
 people recommended{Ecclesbourne}as an 
 excellent school.Also most of the{nice
{houses}are to the north of Derby.     
   Duffield is set in lovely hilly     
 surroundings.It is mainly in a{valley 
 so you can see{countryside hills      
 almost anywhere in the village.       
   My family moved into our house at   
 24,Chestnut Close on Friday,5th.July. 
 It was very hot and the removal men   
 looked as if they'd just come out of  
 the shower,they were sweating so much.
 It took a long time to pack the       
 removal van because it wasn't big     
 enough and the doors wouldn't close.  
   We like living in Duffield because  
{everybody}seems extremely{friendly. }
