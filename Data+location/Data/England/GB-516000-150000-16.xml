		<content>   Friends' Provident was built 1957.It
 was decided to build it in Dorking    
 because London was crowded and people 
 preferred working in the country.There
 are about 1000-1200 people working in 
 the office occupying about 50         
 different kinds of jobs.The office    
 insures Life,Pensions and Health.It   
 used to do General{Insurance }until   
 1974.When the office was built it was 
 made so that if a war broke out it    
 could be immediately changed into a   
 hospital.There is a{Sports Hall}which 
 was opened in 1981.There is a computer
 department(opened 1982)which cost     
 Â£7,850,000 to build.It has 2 IBM      
 computers that link with all the      
 other offices.It is highly protected,
