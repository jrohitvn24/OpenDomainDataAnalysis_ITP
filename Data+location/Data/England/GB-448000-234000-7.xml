          We rang up the three biggest 
 local farms around King's Sutton and  
 asked how many acres of farmland they 
 have, what crops they grow and if they
 have livestock.                       
          Astrop Park Farm is 863      
 acres; they grow winter wheat and     
 winter barley and they have livestock.
          Manor Farm said they grow    
 wheat, barley, potatoes and rape.They 
 have no livestock because there is not
 enough grass.   We saw a big spraying 
 machine  spraying Kerb as a weed      
 controller in the rape.               
          Twyford Farms said they have 
 grass, wheat and barley.They also     
 have livestock such as sheep and      
 cows.They have 1000 acres of          
 farmland.
