		<title>09 A DAY IN AN ADULTS LIFE</title>
		<content>  We interviewed Mrs.Collins who lives 
 in Downham Road. She told us about a  
 normal day in her life. She gets up   
 about 7.00 and lets her two dogs      
 out.After that she wakes her daughter 
 up and makes their breakfast. They    
 usually have porridge. Then she makes 
 the beds and after that she washes and
 dresses. She takes her daughter to    
 school at 8.45 and then she does the  
 house work.If it's warm she takes the 
 dogs for a walk.                      
  She has lunch about 12.00 and then   
 she does some ironing. If it's nice   
 and warm she sits in the garden, or   
 sometimes she cleans the windows.After
 that she prepares the dinner then goes
 to pick her daughter up.Then she gets 
 her dinner. Finally she gets her son's
 dinner.                               
  Afterwards they all watch T.V. before
 going to bed at 10.00.                </content>
