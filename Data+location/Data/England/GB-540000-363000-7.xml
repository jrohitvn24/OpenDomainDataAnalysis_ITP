		<title>07OLD MR.CLOUGH OF HALTON</title>
		<content>    There were 60 pupils in the school 
 when Mr. Clough went, and he left at  
 14.  The village had two windmills    
 which were worked by cloth covered    
 sails which, when released, the wind  
 blew through and allowed the stones to
 start grinding the corn.  The first   
 house out of Spilsby was called the   
 Tan House where they used to kill     
 animals and dry the skins and make it 
 into leather.                         
    There was a wood yard, where wagons
 and carts were made, and a            
 Blacksmith's Shop where the irons for 
 the carts were made, and the horses   
 were shoed.  There was a Butcher's    
 Shop, and two general stores, one     
 supporting a Post Office.             
    The village had a Pinfold, which   
 was a brick square with doors, and any
 stray animals were locked into this   
 until they were claimed.              </content>
