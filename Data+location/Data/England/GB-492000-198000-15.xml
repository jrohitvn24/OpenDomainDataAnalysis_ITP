		<content>   Many businessmen today can run and  
 control their companies from the      
 comfort of their own home.            
 People thought the Sony walkman was   
 clever, well how about the fantastic  
 Japanese T.V. watch?                  
   All these rapid Hi-Tec developments 
 are part of the ever expanding        
 computer and machine world.           
   Computers and robots' biggest roll  
 is in industry. In some car factories,
 cars are made completely by robots-   
 jobs are being replaced because of    
 cheaper and more effective robots- but
 if your boss were a robot, what would 
 you think?                            
   In fact, without computers, we would
 cease to exist in such a civilised and
 complex world. But without us,        
 they would never have been created. We
 exist for each other, but which needs 
 the other more?                       </content>
