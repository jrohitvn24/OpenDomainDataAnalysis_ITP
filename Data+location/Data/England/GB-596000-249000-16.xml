Some children were practic- ing racing 
for the annual Sports Day, and some    
were watching the river, which was     
abnormally high, as it had been the    
wettest June on record.One boy noticed 
a sparrows nest in the cover of the    
electric bell on the outside wall. At  
a staff meeting in the dinner hour, we 
discussed the introduction of a new    
dinner routine which would involve the 
use of trays containing dinner and     
dessert.The staff felt this was a      
lower ing of the children's social     
standards. The children chose their    
activities in the afternoon.Two        
mothers came to help.                  </content>
