In 1985 the main occupation in         
Hollinsclough is farming, mainly dairy 
and sheep.On 8/7/85 we visited         
Mr.Ronnie Gilman's farm.We saw an      
enourmous corn bin which sends corn    
along pipes and it goes into the cow   
troughs so they can eat it while they  
get milked.The cubicle shed has rows   
of cubicles and the calves stay in     
there all winter.The silage pit has    
a hill of silage(cut grass)with a      
big plastic sheet over it,and there    
are tyres on top to keep air out.      
When the cows come up the road and     
they get stones stuck in their feet,   
that is why they go through the foot   
dip.It takes 4minutes to milk a cow    
and it takes 2hours to milk all of     
them.
