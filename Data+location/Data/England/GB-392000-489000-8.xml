		<title>08THE PEOPLE</title>
		<content> The people are divided into two very  
 distinct, but mutually strengthening, 
 groups - the indigenous population and
 the 'offcumdens' (those who have moved
 into the area).                       
 The indigenous population is of       
 predominantly Angle and Norse stock,  
 borne witness to by both the large    
 number of flaxen headed children and  
 aspects of the local dialect. Many of 
 the families, much interwoven, can    
 trace their ancestry within the Dale  
 for very many generations.            
                                       
 The 'offcumdens' are represented by a 
 large number of retired people or     
 professionals in the sphere of        
 education, the National Park or       
 various service industries. They are, 
 on the whole, warily tolerated by the 
 locals.                               
                                       </content>
