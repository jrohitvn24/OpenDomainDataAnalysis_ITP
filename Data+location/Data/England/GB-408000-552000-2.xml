		<title>02The state of the Church.</title>
		<content> I believe the Christian Churches are  
 holding their own despite great       
 difficulties and interior weaknesses. 
 There is a regular witness of Christ  
 through the area,and some of the      
 individual churches have a splendid   
 record in the field of social         
 responsibility,Christian Education,   
 and personal care.Many of the Church  
 groups are trying to be more outward  
 looking and aware of their neighbours.
 Many are breaking down barriers of    
 prejudice,and bigotry.                
 More and more Christians feel that    
 they can act together without trying  
 to exploit one another.This means that
 the community as a whole can obtain a 
 clearer picture of Christian society  
 as it is meant to be.Lay participation
 is the key to this progress, for the  
 number of ordained or officially      
 appointed ministers is less than ever.</content>
