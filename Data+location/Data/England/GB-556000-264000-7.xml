		<title>07STEVENS' MILL BURWELL.</title>
		<content>   The{150 year old clunch-built       
{tower-mill}was used until 1952 when   
 the cap became unsafe.It had fields   
 surrounding it apart from one cottage.
 In{1965}a group of people formed a    
 trust and bought it for Â£5.           
 They had to put in new beams with     
 steel girders because the others were 
 rotten.They concreted the lowest      
 floor while the other three had new   
 planks.These were made of pitch_pine  
 wood which is no longer available so  
 deal was used instead.The machinery   
 was in good working order but had to  
 be painted and cleaned.The fan-tail   
 has been replaced and the sails will  
 be put back this summer.              
 It is hoped to have{a museum in a     
{rebuilt barn}on the nearby allotments.
 This is being brought from outside    
 Burwell.Car-boot sales are held to    
 raise funds.                          </content>
