		<title>19DOMESTICATED ANIMALS(FARLEY)</title>
		<content> On the farms around Farley we keep    
 cows, sheep, chickens and pigs for    
 slaughter. The meat is then eaten. We 
 also keep the cows for milk, the      
 chickens for their eggs and the sheep 
 for their wool.                       
 We also keep animals as pets. Some of 
 these are kept for company such as    
 dogs and cats. Most animals are kept  
 for interest such as guinea pigs,     
 hamsters, rabbits, fish, tortoises,   
 goats and quite a few more. People    
 also keep horses and ponies for       
 riding. Not only do people keep dogs  
 as company but they also enjoy taking 
 the dogs for walks. Most of the       
 population have at least one pet.     
 At school, we keep two rabbits as     
 pets. Their names are Cinders and     
 Candy.
