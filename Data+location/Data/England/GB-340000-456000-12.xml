		<title>12RELIGION IN OVERTON</title>
		<content>There is evidence of a church in       
Overton as far back as Saxon times.The 
present building,with its typical      
Norman doorway,dates largely from @1140
with additions in 1771.The church was  
a chapelry of the Benedictine Priory   
at Lancaster,and was served by the     
monks from 1068 to 1387.The various    
incumbents have lived in the village   
since the first parsonage was Glebe    
Farm on Main Street.The village is     
traditionally Anglican,but there is a  
more recent Roman Catholic church,St.  
BernardÂ£s,built in the 1960Â£s,to serve 
a growing Catholic community.In both   
villages,religion is predominantly the 
concern of the elders of the community 
with the exception of the R.C.group,   
which is mainly from the younger age   
group.
