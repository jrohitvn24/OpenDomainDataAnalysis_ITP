		<title>14PROBLEMS OF OLD AGE</title>
		<content>   The problem with the bus service is,
 that the bus route is right at the top
 of the hill so when the old people    
 want to go into town they have to walk
 all the way up a steep hill. Lots of  
 the old people don't have cars because
 they never did learn to drive , so    
 unless one of their relations gives   
 them a lift, they can't go to town..  
 Some people do manage to walk up to   
 the bus stp so they can go to town;   
 but the bus leaves at about 8.30 for  
 the children to go to school, and that
 is very early for someone old to get  
 up in the morning. If the old people  
 did get up so early and caught the bus
 they would have to stay in town all   
 day, until the school bus came back   
 again at 4.00                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
