		<title>19TOWN COUNCIL MEETING.</title>
		<content>   At the August l985 meeting the Mayor
 reported that the County Council was  
 sympathetic to the council's request  
 for early attention to the poor       
 condition of roads in Fairford.  A    
 bottle bank is to be situated near the
 Fire Station on an experimental basis 
 to extend glass conservation in the   
 district.  Â£5O is to be spent on signs
 warning the public of the penalties   
 for allowing dogs to foul footpaths   
 and verges.  With the probable loss of
 Fairford's allotments following the   
 Fairford Property Review, the council 
 is looking for alternative sites.  The
 possible publication of a community   
 magazine was met with the approval of 
 the councillors who are anxious to get
 over a number of issues of public     
 interest to the whole town.           
                                       
                                       </content>
