		<title>12PARWICH CONSERVATION AREAS</title>
		<content> The school first started to conserve  
 the two areas in the village in 1983  
 and has improved the sites no end. The
 "cave" was one area which at one time 
 was used to keep lost animals and     
 later as a tip. The other area was the
 "corner" which was once used as a     
 butcher's tip. First of all we cleared
 these areas of litter including old   
 food wrappers and broken bottles. This
 was done with the help of people from 
 the Conservation Action Project. The  
 stream was then cleared and some of   
 the nettles removed. Nestboxes for    
 birds were set up and some young trees
 were planted. A bridge was also made  
 for the "cave" area. Every month from 
 the beginning of the year, the 3rd and
 4th years went to the cave and corner 
 and kept a diary recording the growth 
 of trees, ground cover and minibeasts.
