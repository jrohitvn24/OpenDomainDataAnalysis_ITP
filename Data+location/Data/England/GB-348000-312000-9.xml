		<content>     The hotels and restaurants sell   
 nearly every sort of food and some    
 of them specialise in{foreign food}and
{vegetarian}dishes.                    
     Most of the popular restaurants   
 are modern, but have been established 
 for at least ten years. The majority  
 provide over fifty seats for their    
 customers. All of the restaurant      
 owners and workers feel that customer 
 satisfaction, cleanliness and tidiness
 are very important. They all seem to  
 enjoy their work.                     
      We did a survey about the food   
 that people eat on special occassions.
 Not every one thought they got their  
 money's worth. Most people opt for    
 a{three-course meal}and the most      
 popular type of restaurant is the     
{steak house.
