		<title>03EMPLOYMENT IN FELTWELL</title>
		<content>   Feltwell people work in a wide      
 variety of trades. In the village and 
 the immediate surrounding area people 
 work on farms, in shops, on the base  
 and in a small engineering works. A   
 larger engineering works closed down  
 in 1983. Many ladies work on farms    
 doing seasonal work hoeing, cutting   
 and packing vegetables.               
   Many workers travel out of the      
 village to work in Thetford in        
 factories on the industrial estates.  
 Many others work as support staff at  
 the U.S.A.F. bases at Lakenheath and  
 Mildenhall. Some are employed by the  
 Forestry commission in Breckland and  
 others use Feltwell as a base for     
 commercial travelling.                
   Unemployment in the area is lower   
 than in most parts of Britain but     
 there is a greater number of retired  
 people.                               </content>
