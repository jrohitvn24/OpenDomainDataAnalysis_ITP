		<content> The major part of this area is classed
 as an Area of Outstanding Natural     
 Beauty. It includes a stretch of the  
 South Downs Way, much used by local   
 people walking dogs and long distance 
 walkers. This area reaches from       
 Amberley Mount to Rackham and to      
 Kithurst Hill.                        
 The watermeadows, known as Amberley   
 Wildbrooks are well known for their   
 flora and fauna and attract many      
 visitors.                             
 Building is restricted in this area,  
 although some new houses are built    
 mainly on the outskirts of villages,  
 subject to regulations. This is       
 because the area is a conservation    
 area. Part of Amberley Village is     
 also a conservation area.
