		<title>10A HINDU TEMPLE IN SOUTHALL</title>
		<content> At the beginning of Lady Margaret Road
 there is a{Hindu}Temple.  There are   
 many shrines around the room which is 
 spacious and decorated throughout with
 the pictures of the gods and          
 goddesses.  You enter barefooted and  
 the temple is carpeted in red.  When  
 you enter the temple you go up to the 
 shrines and after you have paid your  
 respects to them you ring a bell      
 overhead.  After this the priest will 
 give you a few drops of holy water    
 that you drink.  He also gives sweets 
 that others have donated. Anything    
 that is donated is shared out in this 
 way. Hindus believe that one should   
 not be unkind to any creature and so  
 they are vegetarians. In their worship
 they may sing{Bhajans}or hymns        
 accompanied by tabla, harmoniums and  
 percussion instruments. There is      
 another Hindu temple in Southall.     </content>
