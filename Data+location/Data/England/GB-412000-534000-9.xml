		<title>09Life on Thistleflat Estate.</title>
		<content> Thistleflat is an estate of private   
 houses built by Barratts.             
 There are some swings for the children
 and a big grass hill.An ice-cream van 
 and a van containing vegetables and   
 other foods comes round for the old   
 people who are unable to go down the  
 hill to Crook.                        
 There are no buses travelling around  
 our estate because it is busy enough  
 with the number of cars.              
 The dogs play and run about on the    
 grass areas and around the trees.The  
 builders are costructing some more    
 houses.                               
 I live in a bungalow.Most are the same
 style with 2/3 bedrooms,a small       
 kitchen and a long living room.The    
 semi-detached,detached and link house 
 are all 3/4 bedrooms but there are    
 some small two bedroom flats.Most of  
 the properties have a garage.         </content>
