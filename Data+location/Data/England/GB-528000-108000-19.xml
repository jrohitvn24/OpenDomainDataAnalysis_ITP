		<title>19FLOWERS ON THE DOWNS</title>
		<content>  We found lots of wild flowers on the 
 Downs. They were growing by the edge  
 of the path. We collected one of each 
 kind to draw back at school and to    
 identify.Some children put the flowers
 into groups according to their colour.
 The white  flowers were daisies ,cow  
 parsley,bladder campion and dead      
 nettles.The purple flowers were herb  
 robert and ground ivy. The blue ones  
 were bluebells speedwell.The poppies  
 were red.The yellow flowers were      
 buttercups and dandelions.The green   
 flowers were sticky weed,chickweed    
 moss,stinging nettles,clover,silver   
 weed and grasses like goose grass and 
 ryegrass.Also dockleaf and plantain   
 The trees were sycamore,hawthorn and  
 fir trees.
