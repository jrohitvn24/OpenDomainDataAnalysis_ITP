		<title>09HOLME FARM</title>
		<content>  Holme Farm is an arable farm of 660  
acres,with only a few cattle.  Crops of
vegetables,potatoes,barley and oil seed
rape are grown in a 4 yearly rotation. 
  Horses were used until 1940, but have
now been replaced by 6 tractors. The   
farm is run by the farmer and three    
workers.                               
  Christmas trees are also grown as a  
seasonal cash crop.  Cattle are bought 
and sold at Rugeley and Uttoxeter      
markets,while oil seed rape is sold at 
Wolverhampton.                         
                Summary                
  The farms in the area are of two     
types,arable or dairy.  It was noted   
that all the farms are large           
businesses,each covering a great deal  
of land.                               
  The introduction of machinery has    
reduced the work force in each case.
