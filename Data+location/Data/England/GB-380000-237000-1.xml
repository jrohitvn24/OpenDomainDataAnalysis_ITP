		<title>01WORCESTERSHIRE FARMING</title>
		<content> This is an area of farmland almost    
 equally devoted to grass and cereals  
 to maintain beef and dairy herds of   
 cattle and sheep.  The farms vary in  
 size from 800 acres to smallholdings. 
                                       
 Hay is mostly rolled into large bales 
 for storage, and silage into similar  
 bales each stored in a large black    
 plastic bag.                          
                                       
 Many farms have ponds and occupiers   
 are preserving them both as features  
 and for conservation purposes.  There 
 is a small proportion of deciduous    
 woodland and a small area between     
 Duckswich and Cowhills farms which was
 formerly salt marsh.                  
                                       
 Other minor uses of land are the      
 rearing of riding ponies, dog and     
 plant breeding.                       </content>
