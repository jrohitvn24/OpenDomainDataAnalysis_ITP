		<content> Belton is a large, rural village with 
 a population of approximately 2,100   
 surrounded by flat agricultural land. 
 Junction 2 of the recently completed  
 M180 motorway lies one mile north of  
 the village and affords easy and      
 speedy access to the neighbouring     
 towns of Doncaster and Scunthorpe and 
 to the national motorway network.  The
 majority of the villages working      
 adults commute to work, though farms, 
 a brickworks tile factory and three   
 light industrial units do provide     
 some local employment.  Belton is a   
 selected settlement for development in
 the latest Humberside Structure Plan. 
 Recent building work has included a   
 new primary school, housing and       
 grouped dwellings and further         
 expansion in housing is envisaged for 
 the near future.
