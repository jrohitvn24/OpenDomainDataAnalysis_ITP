		<content>   The Hailsham{Leisure Centre}was     
 built in 1982. It has facilities for  
 ball games such as squash, short      
 tennis, indoor football and           
 basketball. There are also facilities 
 for gymnastics, keep fit and archery. 
                                       
   The Leisure Centre has not yet got a
 swimming pool, but planning for one   
 has already begun and it should be    
 opened in 1987.                       
                                       
   The Leisure Centre is one of        
 Hailsham's greatest assets and most   
 people think that the pool will       
 improve it a great deal. It is        
 conveniently placed behind the        
 shopping centre so that anyone can pop
 in and watch, or take part in one of  
 the varied activities.
