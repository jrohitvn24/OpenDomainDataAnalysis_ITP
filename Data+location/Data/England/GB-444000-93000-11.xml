		<title>11GURNARD SHOPS.</title>
		<content> We made a shopping survey.We went on  
 Thursday morning when the library van 
 comes to the village.We asked people  
 questions outside the Post Office and 
 outside Mr.Dow's shop.Nearly everyone 
 was going to Mr.Dow's shop because he 
 sells food and vegetables and fruit.We
 asked"Do you need more shops?"Lots of 
 people said "a chemist's shop",because
 there are a lot of old people in the  
 village and they can't get into Cowes 
 to get their perscriptions.Some people
 wanted a fish shop so that they could 
 buy fresh instead of frozen fish.     
 Everyone we asked comes to the shops  
 more then once a week. some people    
 come shopping every day.People said   
 the shops in Gurnard are very         
 friendly.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
