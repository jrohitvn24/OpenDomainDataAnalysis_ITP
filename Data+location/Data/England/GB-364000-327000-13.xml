  Here are six main events our school  
 celebrates during the school year.    
    {HARVEST                           
  We celebrate Harvest in September.   
 It's when we say thank you to God for 
 giving us food.The children bring all 
 kinds of food in, like bread, soup and
 vegetables. The Vicar comes to take a 
 special assembly.After the assembly   
 the food is packed into parcels and   
 the children take them to the old     
 people in the Parish.                 
  {  CHRISTMAS                         
  Jesus was born on Christmas Day. At  
 school we have parties to celebrate   
 His birth.It is a happy time. We play 
 games and sing songs.Father Christmas 
 comes and gives out presents to       
 everyone. Also we have a Carol Service
 where we sing special songs to God.   </content>
