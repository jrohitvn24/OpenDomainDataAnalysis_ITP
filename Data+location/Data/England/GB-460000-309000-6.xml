{THE MIDLAND}(pub-situated Melton Road)
 It was originally called The Midland  
 Railway and was built before the road 
 bridge which now crosses the railway  
 line. Two additional storeys were     
 added to bring it level with the road 
 bridge. The basement is thought to be 
 haunted by the ghost of a murdered    
 sheep dealer. Opening hours are:-     
 11.00 _ 14.30. and  18.30 _ 23.00.
