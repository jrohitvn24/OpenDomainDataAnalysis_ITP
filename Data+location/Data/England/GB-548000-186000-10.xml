		<title>10THE BULL PUBLIC HOUSE</title>
		<content> I live at the 'Bull',which is a public
 house in the market place in          
 Romford.In the morning the pub opens  
 at 11a.m.,apart from Sundays when it  
 opens at 12p.m.It closes at 2.3O.p.m. 
 and opens for the evening at 6p.m.On  
 most days the pub closes at           
 1O.3Op.m.(last orders at 1O.2O),apart 
 from Fridays and Saturdays,when it    
 closes at 11p.m.It has 2 bars;the     
 saloon bar,which mostly caters for    
 younger people,and the public bar     
 caters for mainly older men.No_one    
 under the age of 18 can buy drinks and
 the age limit for going into the pub  
 is 14.The saloon bar is dearer and has
 snack food(pub grub) and both bars    
 have amusement machines and juke      
 boxes.The most popular drink sold is  
 beer,followed by spirits              
 e.g.whisky,vodka and gin.
