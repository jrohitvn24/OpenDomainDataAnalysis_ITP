		<content> The Whitchurch area was mentioned in  
 the original Domesday Book of 1086.No 
 specific village merited its own      
 entry,but the whole district was      
 designated as belonging to the 50     
 hides of Keynsham.Keynsham had a large
 abbey which administered the          
 surrounding villages up until the time
 of the Dissolution of the Monasteries.
 Whitchurch has changed a great deal   
 since these times and we are pleased  
 that an updated account of life in our
 area is being included on the 1986    
 Domesday videodisc.                   
 Our entry was compiled through the    
 joint efforts of the following schools
