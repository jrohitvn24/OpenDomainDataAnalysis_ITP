		<content> In 1985 teachers went on strike. Only 
 a few schools were not on strike. In  
 Flixton the Boys' Secondary School    
 were on strike at times but the junior
 school over the road was not affected.
  Teachers help you when you don't     
 understand your work but don't give   
 you any homework during the week.     
 Teachers do not like bad behaviour    
 from their class and don't like too   
 much noise when they take the         
 register. Teachers mark in red only.  
 Teachers do not wear school uniform.  
 Teachers get work as well as the      
 children because they have to mark    
 right or wrong. The Teachers hardly   
 ever join in the songs in assembly and
 they tell you when your work is bad.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
