		<title>01The Edge of Everything</title>
		<content> Our area is on the edge of,           
 Local Authority, Parliamentary        
 Constituency, Police and County,      
 boundaries. We are also on edge of    
 coal measures and just outside Peak   
 district. We live in a desirable area 
 say the estate agents. It is desirable
 if you enjoy rural community with very
 little industry, few facilities such s
 shops, entertainment or buses.  Within
 a few miles we have towns providing   
 all the facilities we lack and also   
 work for many of us.The villages are  
 thus 'dormitory' villages to a large  
 extent and whilst there is a sense of 
 community it is diluted by this fact. 
 The communities in our area  are      
 separated by a valley through which   
 the river Amber flows.  The hillsides 
 offer grazing for dairy cattle. The   
 low hills on which the villages stand 
 make them vulnerable to the weather   </content>
