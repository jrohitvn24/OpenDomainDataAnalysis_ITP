		<content> Elmstead the boundary runs right up   
 the centre of Anglesea road and when  
 I was a child I used to play on it.   
  Over the years they demolished it.   
{Sharon:}What was your school called?  
{Mrs Allen:}Just the Wivenhoe Infants  
  and it was in Philip road.           
{Natasha:}Were the facilities alot     
 different then than now?              
{Mrs Allen:}Well we didn't have school 
 dinners there was no stainless steel  
 it was all where you had to clean the 
 knifes with bath brick.There was      
 sort of steel handles some had bone   
 handles.If you were rich you might    
 have silver there was lino floors     
 everywhere all over the house and the 
 real posh people had lovely wooden    
 floors.Most of the workclass had lino.
{Sarah:}Where any of the shops that are
 here now here when you 1st moved here?
