      The village of Rookhope is a very
 law-abiding village.It is policed by  
 members of the Durham Constabulary,   
 operating from a sectional Police     
 Office some six miles away.           
      Until the late 1950's the village
 was policed by a residential policeman
 (Village Bobby).                      
      Criminal offences of burglary,   
 theft and vandalism are very rare and 
 are committed usually by persons other
 than residents of Rookhope.           
      Since the decline of the lead and
 fluorspar mines the village is of a   
 rural nature which leads to the       
 offences of poaching and sheep        
 worrying.
