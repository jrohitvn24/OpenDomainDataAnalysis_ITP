		<content>  We did a survey about the most       
 popular playground games in our       
 school.They are, football in winter   
 and tennis in summer.The second most  
 popular games are Tiggy and           
 Tig-ball.In Tiggy, one person runs    
 away and another has to chase them.   
 Once caught, the first person has to  
 do the chasing.When you are playing   
 Tig-ball, everyone stands in a circle 
 and whoever catches the bounced ball  
 has to hit someone with it while they 
 run around.The third most popular game
 is shadow catching - jumping on       
 someone's shadow.Another game is      
 Brussels (started after the           
 Liverpool/Juventus Cup match) where we
 pile on top of each other.The teachers
 don't like us playing that, in case we
 get hurt.
