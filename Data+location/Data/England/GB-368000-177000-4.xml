		<title>04"MY FARM LIFE" by R.Ellis.</title>
		<content>  I enjoy driving the tractors and I   
 enjoy the harvest time because it's   
 rewarding to see the crops that you   
 planted come up as nice as they do. I 
 help out by mucking out (YUK!),feeding
 the animals and by doing tractor work 
 such as rotovating or ploughing,and I 
 help by checking that the animals are 
 O.K..                                 
  On the farm we keep sheep,lambs,cows 
 and sometimes pigs.It's O.K. being a  
 farm lad but I do get ratty when my   
 mum and dad keep on telling me what to
 do.But the worst thing is getting up  
 early on those cold winter mornings!
