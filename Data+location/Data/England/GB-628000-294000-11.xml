		<content> The Parish Council consists of 7      
 members of the community,elected every
 4 years.It is non-political;all       
 elected members are unpaid but the    
 Clerk receives a small salary,        
 calculated as a fraction of the parish
 Penny Rate. The Council's main        
 functions are to express local opinion
 on planning applications &amp; to promote 
 action beneficial to the village.     
 Examples here include maintenance work
 on a brook to deter flooding,reporting
 the state of the roads,considering bus
 services &amp; reporting those heavy      
 lorries disregarding an "access only" 
 sign.It is currently trying to        
 purchase some land for an additional  
 playing field.                        
 The council is represented on bodies  
 such as the Village Hall Committee,the
 School Governors,a local charity &amp;    
 emergency &amp; community Services.       </content>
