		<title>03FARMING HEDLEY WEST HOUSE</title>
		<content>{HEDLEY WEST HOUSE FARM}lies a few     
 miles N.of the Causey Arch,just off   
 the main A6076 road.The tenant bought 
 the farm in 1977 from the Bowes Lyon  
 Estate.This farm of 180 acres has been
 worked by the same family for 32 years
 It's a mixed arable farm.Crops include
 potatoes,turnips,cabbages,carrots,    
 onions,sprouts,tomatoes,wheat,barley  
 and corn.They have 60 beef stock,2    
 horses,3 goats, 70 free range hens,a  
 peacock,a peahen,and 3 sheep dogs.    
{   }Being a small family farm         
 everything on the farm is utilized and
 they are able to service the land by  
 keeping hedges and trees in trim and  
 so avoid erosion of the land.         
     The family felt that small farms  
 were better for the conservation of   
 farming and land preservation in the  
 country.Neither of them liked the idea
 of"factory farms".                    </content>
