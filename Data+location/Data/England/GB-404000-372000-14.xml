		<title>14Buxton:Employment.</title>
		<content> Buxton employment figures in 1985 are 
 more favourable than other areas in   
 the {High Peak}but nevertheless       
 numbers of people have to travel out  
 of Buxton to Macclesfield,Stockport   
 and Manchester for work. Nearer Buxton
 itself the limestone quarries at      
 Hindlow, Topley Pike and Tunstead     
 provide work. Buxton itself provides  
 employment for people in the service  
 industries, ranging from the High Peak
 Borough Council itself to shops,      
 schools, offices, and transport.      
 British Rail have a station and an    
 engine depot. North Western Buses have
 a bus station and garage.             
 We discovered further evidence of     
 Buxton's importance as a tourist      
 centre when we listed eighteen hotels,
 all of which provide employment. There
 are also twelve restaurants, cafes and
 eating places.                        </content>
