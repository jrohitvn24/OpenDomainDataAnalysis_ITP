		<title>01GENERAL INFORMATION</title>
		<content> The area embraces three distinct      
 districts, the part of Great Witley   
 with the Parish Church and historic   
 Witley Court, the central area of     
 Hillhampton and Sankyns Green and part
 of the village of Shrawley. The Parish
 Church and Witley Court attract       
 thousands of visitors each year both  
 for sight-seeing and to attend musical
 functions. The central area is        
 completely given over to farming which
 is mainly arable. The main road area  
 of Shrawley is more residential with  
 two public houses and the Post Office 
 and Village Stores. There is a        
 thriving village community here as you
 will see from the activities listed on
 page 16. The Glasshampton Monastery is
 on the border near Astley. The main   
 A443 road from Tenbury to Worcester   
 passes through the block.
