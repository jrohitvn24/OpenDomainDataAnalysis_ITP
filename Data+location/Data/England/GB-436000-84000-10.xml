		<title>10COASTLINE:-COMPTON BAY</title>
		<content>     The cliffs of{Compton Bay}are     
 imposing, to say the least. They are  
 made of a sequence of clays and marls.
     The first bed found,the Wealden,  
 contains a purple marl with sandstone 
 followed by a blue shale. A stratum of
 red and white clay with lignite is    
 next in sequence. Also in the Wealden 
 bed is a great slip of Atherfield clay
 and Wealden shales. Following this is 
 a stratum of chalky beds with springs 
 thrown out by the sandrock stratum.   
     At the base of the cliffs is a    
 layer of Glauconitic marl and chert   
 beds.                                 
     The cliffs are therefore of great 
 interest to geologists.               
     The bay is also very popular with 
 tourists as it is one of the best     
 places to swim on the{ISLE OF WIGHT.
