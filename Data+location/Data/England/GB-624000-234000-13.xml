		<title>13The landscape in Shotley</title>
		<content>  The main village of Shotley is about 
a mile from Shotley Gate,part of which 
is in our block. There are some older  
houses along the main road but most    
of the houses are modern ones on the   
estate built for service families.     
  The land slopes down to the River    
Orwell to the east and the River Stour,
just outside our block, to the south.  
There are marshes beside the Orwell,   
but, unlike those in Trimley, they have
not been ploughed up and they are used 
for grazing by cattle or are cut for   
silage.In the winter the wet land      
attracts wading birds and some ducks,  
  Except at Shotley Point ,there is    
little mud exposed here at low tide,   
but there is an interesting area of    
saltmarsh near Crane's Hill.   The     
higher land is used for arable         
farming,mostly grain.
