		<title>03Pilsey Island</title>
		<content> Pilsey Island is connected to Thorney 
 by a causeway and West Pilsey, a      
 narrow isthmus of hard rocks with     
 between it and the island an area of  
 wet sand, having crops of sea         
 lavender, samphire &amp; bladderwort, with
 marram on the highest sands. This is  
 covered at high tide and is a feeding 
 ground for dunlin, snipe, plover, etc.
  The island, recently acquired by the 
 Royal Society for the Protection of   
 Birds, consists mainly of rough grass 
 and an area of gorseland. Rabbits and 
 birds, such as stonechats and larks,  
 inhabit this part, the seabirds nest  
 on the tideline. Part of the grassland
 is used as a testing ground for paints
 and preparations by the Ministry of   
 Defence. Many birdwatchers come here  
 and there is a good anchorage for     
 yachts on the E. of the island.
