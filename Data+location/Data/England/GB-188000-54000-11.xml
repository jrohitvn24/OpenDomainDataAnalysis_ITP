		<title>11TREFULLOCK MOOR</title>
		<content>   This settlement has grown over the  
 last 25 years, on moorland of little  
 economic value into a rather sprawling
 and from the outside an untidy        
 settlement. In 1940 the nucleus was   
 there in the form of 2 old railway    
 carriage dwellings. The variety of    
 moveable homes is great, including old
 caravans,chalets,old vans and coaches 
 in various states of repair. Some have
 wooden extensions. Often the plots are
 enclosed by poor fences of a mixture  
  of collected materials. A few of the 
 plots were empty. Several animals were
 kept as pets including ponies, dogs,  
 cats and birds. Some of the gardens   
 revealed a pride of possession as     
 plants had been introduced. In one    
 garden there was a young eucalypt, in 
 another a palm and bamboo. However    
 with the predominance of old vehicles 
 the area would not appeal to all.     </content>
