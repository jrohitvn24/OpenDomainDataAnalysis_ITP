		<content> Mrs. Anstis has taught at Cobham      
 Middle School for 33 years. At 26 she 
 had a class of 52 pupils with 50      
 desks. Her classroom was lit by gas.  
 The children brought fresh flowers to 
 school each Monday and 1d. for a      
 bottle of milk each day. In the       
 morning the children would do RE,     
 maths and English. In the afternoon   
 they would have history, geography and
 nature study. They went home at 1600. 
 Lunch was 1200-1345.                  
 She remembered that a girl that was to
 be Mary in a Nativity play came late  
 in a taxi.                            
 When she first taught at the school   
 there was a new cane each year. Girls 
 were caned on their hands and boys on 
 their bottoms. Once Mrs. Anstis was   
 hitting a boy with a ruler when it    
 snapped.
