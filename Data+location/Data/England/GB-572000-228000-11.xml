		<content>     {The Rev A.J.Irwin,}the vicar of  
 both{Shalford}and{Wethersfield        
 Parishes, conducts services at both   
 churches on Sundays and less often at 
{Blackmore End.                        
     {Shalford Church}was built in     
 the 14th century. Repairs were carried
 out around 1812, when the walls were  
 cemented. The clergy vestry and organ 
 chamber were added in 1872. There are 
 three tombs belonging to the{Northwood
{family, 14th cent. Lords of Shalford  
{Manor}and some glass of this time.    
 There is a plaited straw text over the
 chancel arch, probably made at the    
 same time as the framed plaited straw 
 altar frontal, which was shown in the 
{London Exhibition in 1872.}A white    
 ensign hangs in the church. It came   
 from{Admiral Beatty's flag ship, HMS  
{Lion,}which served at the{Battle of   
{Jutland,}in the{1st World War.        </content>
