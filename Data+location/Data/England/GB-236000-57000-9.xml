		<title>09TREVOLLARD HOUSE - TREMATON</title>
		<content> Trevollard House was built as a farm  
 house in 1709. A few years later it   
 became redundant and was converted    
 into a private school for young       
 ladies. In 1900 this school closed,   
 the building was de-roofed for the    
 valuable slates and it subsequently   
 collapsed. In the 1920s about a third 
 of the original house was salvaged for
 use by farm workers, farmers and      
 mothers. In 1975 planning permission  
 was granted for the remaining two     
 thirds of the house to be rebuilt.    
 The finished house was then sold to   
 the present owner, who carried out    
 further renovation before moving from 
 Saltash to live in it in 1977. Born in
 a cottage in Trematon, this lady      
 enjoys gardening and rescuing cobble  
 stones, and she helps the Womens      
 Institute and Merchant Navy Wives     
 club.                                 </content>
