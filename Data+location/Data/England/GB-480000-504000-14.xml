 What of the future ? We live in a     
{National Park}and have lots of        
 tourists - so we don't think the area 
 is going to change very much.         
                                       
 We hope our school will still be here 
 in 15 years time - the year 2000 - but
 our numbers are not very good. Perhaps
 we shall be in a large school with{St.
{Hedda's}and{Grosmont}- we hope not, as
 we have so many traditions that go    
 back to the year 1874.                
                                       
                                       
 We think that{Egton Show}will still   
 be here and the village will remain   
 unchanged.                            
                                       
{We really like living in the country !
