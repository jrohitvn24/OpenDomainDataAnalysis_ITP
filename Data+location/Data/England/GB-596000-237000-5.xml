		<title>05 Social concerns in Polstead</title>
		<content> Currently Polstead parish council is  
concerned with the state of the local  
roads,which are full of "potholes"after
the winter's snow and ice;the parish   
council is pressing for repairs and    
improvements.None are main roads or    
direct links with other places,but many
residents are commuters,and the ever   
increasing size of farm machinery and  
delivery lorries make the narrow lanes 
well used.The state of the village     
green is also high on the list for     
improvement,it is used freely for      
car-parking,and,in an attempt to       
preserve the appearance of the         
green,the parish council is in the     
process of purchasing some"Grasscrete" 
for a small area of the Green.This     
will be costly,but,should it prove     
successful,it is hoped to purchase     
more "Grasscrete" in order to tidy     
the green and facilitate parking.      </content>
