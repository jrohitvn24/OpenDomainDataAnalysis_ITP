		<content> Pauline Lawrance is a thirty seven    
 year old playgroup supervisor.  She   
 has lived in Portchester for nineteen 
 years.  She has no major problems in  
 life but believes the main problems   
 faced by the nation are unemployment, 
 inflation and nuclear war.  When asked
 her solution to these problems she    
 said the first two were too complex   
 and it would be unrealistic to expect 
 Britain to disarm unilaterally.  She  
 says a local issue at the moment is   
 the proposal to sell land south of the
 community centre.  It should be left  
 as open space.  Her main hope for the 
 future is for her two children to gain
 employment.  According to her, Britain
 has lost its credibility as a major   
 force during her lifetime.
