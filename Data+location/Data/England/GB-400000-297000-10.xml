		<title>10WALSALL'S LEATHER TRADE</title>
		<content> Walsall has been famous for leather   
 goods for hundreds of years,          
 particularly for Saddlery. To put our 
 minds back on leather, our class      
 walked around our streets and we found
 a few leather manufacturers, so we    
 still keep up our reputation.         
 We did a survey of the 'Yellow Pages' 
 to find out how many leather          
 manufacturers Walsall has. There are  
   Leather garment mfrs     1          
   Leather goods mfrs      51          
       and merchants                   
   Saddlers and harness    45          
          makers                       
 Walsall Football Club's nickname is   
 the 'Saddlers', there is a club in    
 Walsall called 'The Saddler's Club'   
 and Walsall's new shopping centre is  
 called 'The Saddler's Centre'.
