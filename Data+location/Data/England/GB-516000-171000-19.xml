		<title>19DERELICTION IN TWICKENHAM</title>
		<content>    There are many derelict buildings  
 in Twickenham, but two of the most    
 famous are the{Odeon Cinema}and       
{Twickenham Swimming Baths.            
 Once Twickenham Pool was a hive of    
 activity with a big cafe, two pools   
 and a diving board.Nowadays weeds grow
 between the paving stones and graffiti
 lines the pool instead of water. Now  
 instead of towels and sunbathers      
 around the edge of the pool, broken   
 bottles, old tyres and rubbish have   
 taken their place.                    
 The Odeon Cinema, originally the      
 Luxor, was opened on November 18th.   
 1929 at the junction of Heath Road and
 Cross Deep. It was then converted into
 a theatre and then back to a cinema   
 before becoming derelict in 1979.     
 Apart from being a lovely piece of    
 architecture, it is one of the biggest
 derelict buildings in the area.       </content>
