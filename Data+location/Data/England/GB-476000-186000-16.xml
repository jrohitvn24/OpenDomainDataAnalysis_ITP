		<title>16A Friendly Ghost.</title>
		<content>Pheasants Coombe cottage was once three
small houses built 300 years ago.When  
the present occupier first went to live
there,she developed bronchitis and she 
called in the doctor.He asked her how  
she was getting on with her poltergeist
Peter Pheasant.                        
  Peter Pheasant was a very friendly   
old man who once owned part of the     
cottage.The lady of the house noticed  
that a large lamp shade kept falling   
off and a strip light in an alcove was 
disliked by Peter.The light was always 
going out even after the wiring had    
been checked.Guests who stayed         
overnight and who brought bedside      
clocks found the clock on its face the 
next morning.Peter is friendly and the 
owner talks to him.He has never broken 
anything although a valuable brooch and
a cut crystal tumbler have been        
spirited away.                         </content>
