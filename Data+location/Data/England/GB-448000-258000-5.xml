		<title>05Portrait of a farm (NUMBER 1</title>
		<content>This first farm is 297 acres in size.It
is almost wholly within our block.It is
mainly an arable farm,though 47 acres  
are used for the rearing of            
bullocks.These animals are mostly from 
the Continent(Charolais and Limousin), 
but there are some Friesians as well.  
There are usually 50 or more bullocks, 
but some have been sold to Banbury Mar 
ket.No more have been bought yet as    
corn is so expensive.                  
The arable land is about equally       
divided between winter wheat,winter    
barley and spring barley.Yields have   
been low in 1985,on average half a ton 
per acre less than in 1984.About half  
the straw is burned,and half made into 
round bale silage for winter feed.     
All arable land here is ploughed before
sowing.The farmer didn't believe in"   
this 'ere minimal cultivation".
