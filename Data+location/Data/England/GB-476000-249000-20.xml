		<title>20Social Problems in Villages</title>
		<content>                                       
We have many social problems in the    
village.There is alot of vandalism     
as well as crimes committed like;theft,
burglary,a murder and an IRA arms and  
bomb cache.The council have done their 
best to supply things for the village. 
The worst thing about it is that things
keep on getting vandalized.They are    
planning to build a community centre.  
We  think it is going to be vandalized 
too .There is nothing for the younger  
generation.The most entertainment is   
for the older generation.Lots of people
complain but there was a football and a
cricket club and both finished because 
of lack of support.We think the trouble
is that so many people are new to our  
village that most dont feel they belong
to it at all so they dont bother.
