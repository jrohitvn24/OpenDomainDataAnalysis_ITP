		<title>07LOCAL SHOPS IN CORBY.</title>
		<content>Each neighbourhood has a local shopping
centre, but the new supermarkets have  
badly hit their businesses. Old folk   
and mothers of small children find them
most convenient. Pytchley Court has 12 
shops: a Co-op store, a newsagent,     
chemist, baker, butcher, hair-dresser, 
t.v./electrical shop, a bookmaker and a
fish &amp; chip shop which is very popular.
Studfall shops include a hardware store
and a greengrocer, while Welland Vale  
has a wine/off licence shop. Beanfield 
shops are similar. All of the owners   
liked their area, and said they had    
regular, friendly customers. Most      
shops open 6 days a week, from 9am to  
1pm and 2.15 to 5pm, with half day on  
Wednesdays. Between them they sell all 
that most people need: food, clothes,  
toys, paraffin, medicine, newspapers,  
sweets, cigarettes, ornaments, radios..
can you tell who sells what ?          </content>
