 The canal was completed in 1774. The  
 design of the bridges, lock-keepers'  
 cottages, paddle-gear and bollards are
 unique to the navigation. Commercially
 it served corn and textile mills and a
 malt industry. Other cargoes were     
 coal, lime and stone.                 
 Lee, Nephew &amp; Sons &amp; Squire Ratcliffe 
 &amp; Sons (Textiles) were notable mill-  
 owners. Their mills have now been sub-
 let to small businesses, having no    
 association with the canal. Bass      
 Charrington has continued the Malt    
 Industry initially established by     
 Crowther. The C.&amp; H.N.declined due to 
 railway and motor lorry competition,  
 but today enjoys a revival being      
 maintained by British Waterways Board 
 to serve the expanding pleasure       
 cruising industry.
