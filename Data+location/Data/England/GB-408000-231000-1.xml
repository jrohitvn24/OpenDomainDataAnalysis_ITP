		<title>01SNOWSHILL IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE</title>
		<content> This has always been an agricultural  
 district although there is some       
 woodland. Barley, wheat and sprouts   
 are the main crops but the area is    
 best known for sheep which have grazed
 on these hills since time immemorial. 
 At the north of the block lies the    
 oolitic limestone village of Snowshill
 which consists of the manor house, the
 pub, the village hall, the post office
 and houses and cottages clustered     
 around the village green and the      
 church. In the 1086 Domesday the      
 population was about 80 and now it is 
 approxiamtely 150. Snowshill has      
 always been a farming community and   
 this is still true although inevitably
 others have moved in and a few        
 cottages have become holiday homes.   
 The mainly sixteenth and seventeenth  
 century Snowshill Manir, belonging to 
 the National Trust, attracts visitors </content>
