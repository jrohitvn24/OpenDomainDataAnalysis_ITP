		<title>05JENNINGS FACTORY</title>
		<content>}Jennings deals with laboratory        
 equipment but they do not make many of
 their own products. The only thing    
 that they make, is done by the owner, 
 Mr.Jennings,who blows glass and has   
 invented a couple of things as well.  
 Jennings first went into business in  
{1952}but only moved to East Bridgford 
 in{1967.                              
 Many of the chemicals are corrosive.  
 Jennings sell their products to all of
 the U.K. and to some other countries  
 as well.                              
 There are{17}workers in Jennings,and  
{5}of them are from East Bridgford.They
 work for{8\}hours a day(9am-5.30pm).  
 Before Jennings,the factory was being 
 used by a Nottingham electronic firm. 
 Before then it was Batchelors peas,   
 and before that Masons peas.          
 A prototype video recorder was        
 invented on these premises.           </content>
