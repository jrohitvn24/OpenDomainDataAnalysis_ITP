		<content>      We carried out a traffic census  
 of all vehicles leaving the M6        
 motorway at junction 27, and          
 distinguished between traffic         
 travelling to the junction from North 
 or South, between private and         
 commercial vehicles, and between those
 going West, (probable destination     
 Parbold, Appley Bridge or Croston) and
 East (probable destination Standish or
 Shevington)  In all 243 vehicles were 
 counted in the 30 minutes(1.45 to 2.15
 pm) on a Wednesday.  Our findings were
 that twice as many vehicles entered   
 the area from the South as from the   
 North.  There were twice as many      
 private as commercial vehicles.       
 Private vehicles travelling East      
 exceeded those travelling West by 2:1.
 Of the commercial vehicles there were 
 slightly more leaving to the West than
 to the East.                          </content>
