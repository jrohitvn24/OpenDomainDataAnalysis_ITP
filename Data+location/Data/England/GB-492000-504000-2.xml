		<content> Along the road is St. Stephen's Church
 with a saddle back tower and          
 graveyard.Further along is the village
 of Robin Hoods Bay at the bottom of a 
 1:3 hill.  You are not allowed to take
 your car down to the sea where the old
 fishermen's houses cluster together on
 the hillside.  Now there is little    
 fishing and few local people live in  
 the old village.                      
 Beyond the slipway rocky scars lead   
 out to the cold grey North Sea. The   
 beach is interesting. You can find    
 fossils, shells and rocks, some from  
 other countries. There are small      
 patches of sand where you can play.   
 At the top of Bay Bank the houses are 
 not so old. There is an estate called 
 Mount Pleasant built when the railway 
 first came to accommodate holiday     
 makers and retired people.
