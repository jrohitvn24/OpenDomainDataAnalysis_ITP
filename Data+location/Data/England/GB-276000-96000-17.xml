		<title>17TRADITIONAL DANCING,Yeoford.</title>
		<content> At our school we do traditional       
 dancing. One of the dances we do is   
 called Maypole Dancing. There is a big
 pole in the middle and there are      
 different coloured ribbons. They are  
 red, blue, yellow and green. One dance
 that we do is called Single Plaiting, 
 another dance is called Double        
 Plaiting, another dance is the        
 Barber's Pole and the last dance is   
 called the Spider's Web. As well as   
 Maypole Dancing, we do Broom Dancing  
 with one of the teachers. One Saturday
 two teachers and one adult and nine   
 children went to the first{Exeter     
 Health Fair. It was a very enjoyable  
 day. We did broom dancing. The lady   
 who organised it gave the broom       
 dancers a tee_shirt each and a        
 certificate each. We also do Scottish 
 Dancing. The teacher who teaches      
 Scottish Dancing comes from Scotland! </content>
