		<title>03Buildings. Swainby &amp; Potto</title>
		<content> The most dominant buildings are       
{Swainby}Church, built in 1875-77, and 
 the Victorian Vicarage. The older     
 houses, dating from 1718, are of local
 freestone, with distinctive kneelers  
 and pantiled gabled roofs. Yorkshire  
 sliding-sash windows were traditional 
 in these buildings. The majority of   
 the old cottages have been modernised 
 and extended but maintaining the      
 vernacular wherever possible. The     
 bungalows for the elderly are         
 terraced single-storied brick units   
 with landscaped open-plan grounds. In 
{Potto,}the original cottages are of   
 locally made brick. Potto Hall, built 
 in the 1860s as a private house and   
 now a club/hotel, is the main         
 substantial building, standing outside
 the township. Modern building has been
 mainly restricted to bungalows, some  
 with dormer windows.                  </content>
