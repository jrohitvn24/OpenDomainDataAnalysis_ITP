		<content> We do not have a permanent surgery in 
 our area but the local Doctor comes   
 to Ingoldsby for surgery twice a week 
 on Tuesday and Friday.The surgery     
 takes place in the village hall at    
 about 4o'clock.The Doctor brings a    
 basket full of medicine so that you   
 do not need to go to his main surgery.
 I think this is a good idea especially
 for OAPs and ill people.The Doctor    
 calls in to see really ill people on  
 Tuesday and Friday.If you are very    
 ill and it is not Tuesday or Friday   
 the Doctor will come over.            
 Once a month on Wednesday there is a  
 clinic for toddlers and babies.The    
 clinic is run by two district nurses. 
 At the clinic the two nurses weigh the
 babies and sell good food for the     
 toddlers.If the baby is ill they will 
 give the mother tablets or medicine,  
 they also give injections.            </content>
