		<content> Jack Upperton's Gibbet is located in  
 Upper Wepham Woods, at a crossroads 6R
 051078.  A Gibbet was an iron cage to 
 keep an offender inside and stop the  
 family from taking the body.  In the  
 18th century many crimes were capital 
 offences.                             
 Upperton was hanged and gibbeted for  
 attempted robbery of the Royal Mail   
 which William Baldry was carrying on  
 horseback from or to Steyning.  Jack  
 Upperton was sentenced to death at    
 East Grinstead.  The Judge's sentence 
 conformed with the custom of the time,
 which was that the criminal should be 
 gibbeted as near as possible to the   
 place of the offence as a warning to  
 others.                               
 Today a metal post 6 feet high marks  
 the spot.  Originally the gibbet stood
 on open downland, today the forest has
 encroached on it.                     </content>
