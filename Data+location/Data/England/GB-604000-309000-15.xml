		<content>    Mr.Norton delivers his bread and   
 cakes to Barnham Broom,Barford,       
 Garvestone,Reymerston and Toftwood as 
 well as Mattishall.He employs two     
 other people.He has worked in the     
 bakery since he left school.On Fridays
 Mr.Norton shuts the shop at 18.00 and 
 starts work again at 19.30 until 01.30
 on Saturday.                          
     When Mr.Norton lived in the       
 village as a boy there were far fewer 
 houses and bungalows,far more open    
 fields. There was no doctor's surgery:
 when you were ill you went to the     
 doctor's house. He notices much more  
 traffic now,particularly heavy        
 traffic.He wishes someone would slow  
 the lorries down!                     
     When he went to school there were 
 only seventy-five school children in  
 the whole of Mattishall!
