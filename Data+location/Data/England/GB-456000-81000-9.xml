 Sandown were built after the 2nd World
 War.They are either Private Houses,   
 Guest Houses or Hotels.There are also 
 many bungalows which are 5 years old  
 or younger.There aren't many council  
 houses in are area.The buildings are  
 mainly a mixture of brick,pebbledash, 
 concrete blocks and stone.            
  The style of houses varies,they are  
 mostly semi-detached,detached and     
 terraced.In the Old Village the houses
 are mostly old cottages and stone     
 houses converted into shops.There is  
 also a pub called the Crab Inn which  
 is a stone built cottage with a       
 thatched roof.Most of the cottages    
 have thatched roofs in the Old        
 Village.
