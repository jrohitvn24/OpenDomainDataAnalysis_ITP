 School age children now have to attend
 Swaffham Bulbeck or Bottisham primary 
 schools. The secondary school for the 
 area is Bottisham Village College.    
 Lode village primary school was closed
 this year, as not enough children     
 attended. Most primary age children   
 from the fen are driven to school by  
 their parents, or taken to a bus      
 collection point in the village.      
 Parents seem generally satisfied with 
 the school standards and facilities.

 Medical services are available from   
 Bottisham surgery. Hospital facilities
 are available in Newmarket and        
 Cambridge, but delays of many months  
 are common for chronic cases.         </content>
