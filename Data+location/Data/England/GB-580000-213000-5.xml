		<content>  Witham is a small town with a        
 population of 25,000 people,therefore 
 we would not need a lot of places for 
 sport.                                
 There is only one main{sports centre} 
 in Witham. It is called The Bramston  
 Sports Centre and is part of the      
 Bramston Comprehensive School,one     
 of the two secondary schools in       
 Witham.It has three pools, a large    
 sports hall and several specialised   
 rooms .There are outside sports       
 pitches, and a canteen .It was opened 
 in 1973 by Henry Cooper.One of the    
 newest sports is American football.
