 Originally Farringdon School was in   
 the eastern part of the village in a  
 building now called The Old School    
 House. But in the late 1920's the     
 school transferred to its present     
 site, part of   Massey's Folly. In    
 1984 Farringdon and Selborne          
 Primary Schools officially merged     
 becoming known as Bushdown Primary    
 School. Merger was due to low numbers 
 but it was decided to keep both       
 buildings open. The headteacher is    
 Mrs. Ann Bamford, based at Selborne,  
 with Mrs.Grant and Mrs. Lodder        
 teaching at Farringdon.
