		<content>{ Livestock}still plays an important   
 part in the show, and is listed as one
 of the{main attractions.}Despite      
 modern technological leisure pursuits 
 the attendance has been and is        
{increasing,}although the{military     
{displays}are{much less popular        
 (perhaps because of T.V coverage) and 
 the{trade stands}have become much{more
{popular.}The showground is used for   
 many other{minor events}through the   
 year including dog shows, cub and     
 scout jamborees, gymkhanas and even   
 the Anglian Bible week. In fact, the  
 ground can be hired out for almost any
 event, but the{rules on trading are   
{very strict.}This is because it is a  
{charity organisation,}and of the 4\   
 thousand employees of the association,
 most of them are volunteers.
