		<content>   VISITING THE VILLAGE OF BREAN ON A  
SUNNY DAY IN MID-SUMMER,AS WE DID FOR  
THIS PROJECT,WE FOUND THAT DRIVING     
ALONG THE ROAD WAS HAZARDOUS.THIS WAS  
PARTLY DUE TO THE NARROWNESS OF THE    
ROAD,BUT DUE TO THE MANY CARS AND      
PEOPLE IN SCANT SUMMER DRESS.THE SUMMER
POPULATION,OF THIS TINY RESORT,IS ABOUT
TWO HUNDRED TIMES THE WINTER POPULATION
OF SOME ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE.            
   THE CHURCH OF SAINT BRIDGET HAS BEEN
RECENTLY REFURBISHED AND ITS INTERIOR  
IS PLEASING FOR THOSE WHO WORSHIP OR   
VISIT THERE.THERE HAS BEEN A CHURCH ON 
THE SITE FOR AT LEAST SEVEN HUNDRED    
YEARS.THE METHODIST CHURCH IS MUCH MORE
RECENT BUT IS EQUALLY INVITING.        
   IN WINTER BREAN SLEEPS.IN SUMMER IT 
IS ALIVE AND BUSY.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
