		<title>13RELIGION - KILMERSDON</title>
		<content> The Parish Church of St Peter and St  
 Paul - the only place of worship. It  
 is a fine building of perpendicular   
 Gothic with substantial Norman remains
 and a l00 ft high tower built about   
 l443. The living was in the gift of   
 the Jolliffe family who became Roman  
 Catholic a generation ago. Kilmersdon 
 has not had a vicar of its own since  
 l976.  The living is held in plurality
 with Radstock. Attendance is variable 
 but the church still has an important 
 part in village life and supported    
 well financially even by those who    
 rarely attend. Kilmersdon and         
 Babington Parishes united in l978, but
 numbers at St Margarets are now so few
 that only occassional services are    
 held there. Kilmersdon is fortunate in
 its vicar, but the loss of a resident 
 incumbent is still felt keenly. Other 
 denominations go outside the area.    </content>
