		<content>{ STAINLAND}                           
    Stainland is in the South Pennines 
 and is between the towns of Halifax   
 and Huddersfield. Stainland got its   
 name from stoney land because it is   
 built on sand stone. Most of the      
 houses are old and built of stone,    
 some have been sandblasted to make    
 them look new. There is a new housing 
 estate called Fall Spring Gardens, and
 these houses are built of yellow      
 brick. Other new houses are built of  
 fake stone called Marshalite.         
    In the middle of Stainland there is
 a park and playing field. Here you can
 play football and rugby in winter, and
 cricket, tennis, bowls and putting in 
 summer. There are swings, slides and a
 climbing frame to play on all year    
 round. The park was built as a War    
 Memorial.
