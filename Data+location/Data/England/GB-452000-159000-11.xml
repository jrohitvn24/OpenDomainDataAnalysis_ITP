		<title>11Lucy's School Day</title>
		<content>   I wake up at seven, then at seven   
 thirty I get dressed and go down to   
 have my breakfast which is toast and  
 tea.   Eight o'clock is time to get   
 ready for school and brush my hair.   
 I set off at eight thirty.   School   
 starts at nine.   At five minutes     
 past nine Mrs. Everitt comes to       
 collect money for dinners &amp; at        
 9.15 we go to assembly.   At 9.3O     
 we start Maths usually till break     
 at 1O,3O.   After break we do         
 English until lunch at midday.   Most 
 people have a dinner cooked at school 
 &amp; others have sandwiches.   Playtime  
 lasts until one o'clock.    From one  
 to two we have art, often clay        
 modelling, folllowed by another       
 play.The day ends with project        
 work,games and a story till 3.3O.
