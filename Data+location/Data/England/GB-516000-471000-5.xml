		<content>      {Education} is at the forefront  
 for the younger villagers starting    
 with the pre-school playgroup which   
 meet twice a week. The next step is   
 the village {Primary School}which has 
 recently been extended. At present 63 
 children are catered for between the  
 ages of 4+ to 11 years. Unlike many   
 village schools the number of pupils  
 has increased during the past few     
 years, due in part to the various {   
{housing developments}taking place.    
      Children of secondary school age,
 i.e. 11+ to 16 (or 18 in the case of  
 sixth formers) travel into {          
{Bridlington}to one of the two         
 comprehensives. From there some may go
 on to the{East Yorkshire}College of   
 Further Education or some other       
 educational establishment. Others will
 join the quest for employment.
