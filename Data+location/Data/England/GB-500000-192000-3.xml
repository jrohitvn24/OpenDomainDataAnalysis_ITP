		<content> have their lunch.When I finished      
 eating my sandwiches we practised     
 majorettes for the fete.              
   In the afternoon we did our project.
 My project is on music.Later we played
 rounders with the 3rd years.          
    When I got home from school I      
 watched T.V. until my dinner was      
 ready.For dinner I had chips,beans,and
 a beefburger.                         
    After dinner I went out to play.   
 When I came in I had my bath and went 
 down to watch Dallas.Dallas is my     
 favourite T.V. programme.I like it    
 because there are good characters in  
 it.Also the B.B.C think it out very   
 carefully.When Dallas had finished I  
 read my books for a little while then 
 went to sleep.
