   When my family and I go shoping we  
go into Derby we used to live there    
but some times we go to to Mickelover. 
In Mickleover there are shops and big  
super markets.                         
   In Pickwell where we live now       
there are NO shops. The nearest shop   
is in Somerby   it is a post office    
and it does'nt   sell everything like  
a super market.                        
   We usualy go shopping on a Monday or
Tuesday.                               
   My Mum shops in Somerby to buy      
stamps paper and sweets but she does   
most of her shopping in Melton Mowbray 
where there is a market and where the  
banks are.
