		<title>10RECREATION IN WHALEY BRIDGE</title>
		<content> There are two reservoirs in our area  
 these are Toddbrook and Combs which   
 both supply water for the canal these 
 also provide extra facilities such as 
 fishing,windsurfing and sailing.Both  
 reservoirs have clubs for sailing and 
 windsurfing which own optimists for   
 beginners,toppers for advanced        
 beginners,mirrors for two people and  
 GP's(general purpose)for two or more  
 people.I have been to one of these    
 clubs for a course on sailing. This is
 what I thought about it The first week
  after I'd struggled to put my life   
 jacket on when I got on the water I   
 pulled the rope in to go fast.        
  One side of the boat lifted out of   
 the water. I was terrified. I         
 wondered what would happen if I       
 capsized.I was so busy thinking about 
 capsizing I nearly hit the buoy. Then 
 I eventually got back I wished I could</content>
