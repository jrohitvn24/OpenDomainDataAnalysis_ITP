		<content>{    A BRANSFORD SCHOOL PUPIL'S DAY    
      It is Monday and Dad gets up at  
 6 a.m.  When he goes to work at 6.45  
 Mum gets up and at 7.00 she wakes my  
 three sisters and me.  We have break- 
 fast at 7.15, usually cereals or      
 toast, then watch T.V. until 7.45.  At
 8.00 one sister catches the school    
 'bus to Malvern and at 8.45 Mum takes 
 the rest of us to school at Bransford 
 then she goes to work herself at Leigh
 Court.  She starts work at 9.00 and   
 she is a cleaner.  My dad is a coalman
 and he delivers coal as far as        
 Worcester.  We take sandwiches for    
 lunch at school.  Mum picks us up from
 school at 3.45 and we have a cooked   
 meal before we go to Youth Club at    
 7.00 p.m.  At 7.15 Dad goes to crib at
 the 'Cross Keys' at Suckley.  Mum     
 picks us up at 9.00 and we go home and
 have a snack before we go to bed.     </content>
