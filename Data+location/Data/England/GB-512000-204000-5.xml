		<title>05VERULAMIUM PARK</title>
		<content>{Verulamium Park}is one of the most    
 popular recreational areas in St      
 Albans. It contains two lakes which   
 were excavated partly to provide work 
 for some of the unemployed from the   
 North during the Depression of 1930 - 
 1934. In the larger of the lakes there
 are two islands which provide         
 something of a bird sanctuary for the 
 many ducks, geese and swans which     
 abound. The park includes cricket and 
 football pitches and tennis courts.   
 Sometimes a fair visits the park on   
 August Bank Holidays. Much of the park
 covers what used to be the old Roman  
 city of{Verulamium}and parts of the   
 wall of that city can still be seen   
 there. Overlooking the park is the {  
{Cathedral and Abbey Church of St      
{Alban. }
