		<content>The Station possesses a finger print   
machine but no intoximeter. There are  
no cells, the nearest ones being at    
Wombourne where the nearest            
Magistrate's Court is also located.    
Stray animals are received and there is
a kennel. The animals are held for up  
to 24 hours before being taken away.   
The nearest Police Dog Handlers are at 
the main base in Stafford. The Codsall 
Police Officers involve themselves in  
the community in ways apart from their 
normal role. At the moment there is a  
S.P.A.C.E. (Staffordshire Police       
Activity and Community Enterprise)     
scheme in operation which provides     
sport and leisure activities for local 
children during the school holidays.   
WPC. Turner confessed to a liking for  
Police stories on TV !
