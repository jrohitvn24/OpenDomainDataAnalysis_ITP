		<title>15Ropley Pram Race</title>
		<content> The Ropley Pram Race is an exciting   
 event which is held each year on      
 spring bank holiday Monday.The race   
 goes round the three pubs in Ropley   
 and keen competitors practise around  
 the course in the weeks before the    
 race.There are sections for men,ladies
 and children.You need fast runners if 
 you want to win but some people just  
 enter the decorated pram competition  
 and some run the course for fun.Some  
 of the decorated prams are very good  
 and a lot of time is spent preparing  
 them.The winner this year was made    
 into a tank.The race starts at the    
 rec.and the course goes first to the  
 Star,then the Chequers and finally to 
 the Anchor.At each pub the adult      
 competitors have to drink half a pint 
 of shandy.The winners get a cup to    
 keep for the year.Then there is a fete
 and everyone has a good time.         </content>
