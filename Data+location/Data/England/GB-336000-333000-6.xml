		<content> In 1785 two brothers called Fullwood  
 set up a firm which was to become     
 Britains best known milking machine   
 manufacturer.Today they still stand in
 that position in the U.K.and in Europe
 Fullwoods give more help to the dairy 
 industry than any other business and  
 have medals to prove it.Fullwood and  
 Bland employ 218 people,but in the    
 1970's employed twice as many people. 
 But with a small workforce,they make  
 all the parts for the machines.They   
 have workshops for metal and plasic   
 parts and there is a demand for their 
 products.Fullwoods also make milking  
 machines for sheep and goats.Interest 
 in goat farming has increased in the  
 last couple of years and Fullwoods is 
 making it increase even more.Sheeps   
 milk is also in demand and Fullwoods  
 make a range of milking machines for  
 goats and sheep.                      </content>
