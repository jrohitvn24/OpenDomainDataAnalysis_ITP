   The{Youth Club,}on Allendale Rd., is
 is for people aged 7-21 and different 
 groups meet each night.  For example  
 there is a 'Girls 'Night',and a night 
 for those aged 7-10. It is organised  
 like this in order to cater for a wide
 range of interests.

 to be closed for a few days because   
 the outside of the building had been  
 badly vandalised.                     </content>
