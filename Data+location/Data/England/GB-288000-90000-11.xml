		<title>11PARKES PORSCHE,EXETER.</title>
		<content>   Parks Porsche is situated next to   
 Weddels slaughter house in St.Thomas. 
 Parks was formed in 1980 because the  
 director lived there.They believed    
 there was a gap in the market and     
 nobody was selling Porshes in the     
 South West.The nearest place that     
 sells Porsches is in Bournemouth.     
   Porsche cars are highly sophis-     
 ticated for maximum performance.Their 
 owners range from being rich business 
 men to ordinary working men.Porsches  
 can reach high speeds ranging from 160
 mph to 127 mph.                       
   Porsches are expensive cars but     
 their owners believe them to be       
 worth-while.Their costs range from    
 Â£13500 to Â£35000.Porsche have a lot of
 extras such as compact stereo,electric
 windows,heated wing mirror and aerial.
 There are truly luxury cars.No wonder 
 Parks are proud of these German cars. </content>
