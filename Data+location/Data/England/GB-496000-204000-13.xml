		<content> The Old Vicarage built 1875 on site of
  pub "Golden Eagle" and Smithy. These 
 moved to cottages on main road. Now   
 only "The Eagle" exists. Smith-Dorri- 
 ens employed their own village        
 carpenters,bricklayers, ect.,but some 
 of the population worked in boot      
 factories in Cheshem. With improved   
 methods of arable farming many agric- 
 ultural workers returned to the land. 
 In 1923 ten council cottages were     
 built to rehouse land workers. Once   
 only 15 dwellings surounded the green,
 today over 100.The Memorial Hall built
 after the 1914-18 war replaced by     
 larger R.A.F. hut in 1966 now the     
 Village Hall. Two Dells Lane named    
 after two brothers of Little Harriotts
 Farm.Hogg Lane called after a man     
 named Hogg who drove pigs along the   
 pathway.Johnslane was St.Johns Lane   
 and led to St.Johns Well,Berkhamsted. </content>
