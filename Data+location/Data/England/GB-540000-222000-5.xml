		<content>  The name Albury,(a main village in   
 this area),was first recorded as      
 Eldeberie,then later as Audebir (in   
 1230) and more recently by the name of
 Albury.This means 'Old Burh' or       
 'Ealda's Burh'.                       
  The main building of historical      
 interest is Albury Church of which the
 oldest part was built in the 13th     
 century.The nave was built in the 14th
 century and the rood screen (a screen 
 separating the main part of the church
 from the altar) was built in 1400.    
 There are 6 bells and 2 memorial      
 brasses are to be found on the floor. 
  There used to be a disused windmill  
 just outside the main street of Little
 Hadham but the owner burnt it down due
 to the great cost of restoring it.
