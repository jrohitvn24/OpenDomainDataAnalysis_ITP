		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO ABERDEEN.</title>
		<content>  Our study area is NW.of Aberdeen town
 centre.Aberdeen is called The Granite 
 City or The Silver City because the   
 old buildings are constructed in      
 granite which sparkles silver in the  
 sun.It is a booming town thanks to    
 north sea oil. Aberdeen is the 3rd    
 largest city in Scotland with 200,000 
 people.The main industries are oil,   
 fishing,farming &amp;tourism.There are 2  
 rivers,the Dee &amp; the Don.             
  Primary 7K of Scotstown School,Bridge
 of Don researched the information.We  
 went out on site and wrote away,and in
 class we studied the area with maps.We
 used newspapers and local directories.

 it was good fun.We saw things that we 
 didn't know existed.We met people who 
 told us interesting stories.The areas 
 studied include Bankhead,Danestone,
