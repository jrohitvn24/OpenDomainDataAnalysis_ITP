		<content> In the 19th century men used to smoke 
 clay pipes. Burrowbridge was famous   
 for the pipes which were made there.  
 In the 1851 census there were 22      
 pipemakers recorded as living there.  
 Recently a resident was digging in his
 garden and found hundreds of pieces of
 clay pipe which had obviously been    
 there for many years.                 
 The Baptist Chapel has still got the  
 rings mounted in the walls where      
 people used to tie up their horses    
 when they went to church.             
 A lady now living in Moorland         
 remembers being taken to school in a  
 wagon drawn by a horse.               
 Charcoal used to be made from the     
 willows which grow on the moors.      
 The most famous person associated with
 the area is King Alfred.
