		<content> could be improved.                    
                                       
 I am a managing director and have been
 for 10yrs.I work 3 days a week and    
 about 8hrs. a day.                    
                                       
 I have been a teacher for             
 7yrs.previously I was a worker with   
 Anglian Water.I spend 5 days a week at
 school and work about 7hrs. a day. I  
 think I deserve more pay.             
                                       
 I am a librarian.I work a 5 day week  
 of 37hrs.i think the pay is good and  
 I enjoy having so many books          
 available.Fewer hours a week would    
 improve the job.                      
                                       
 I am a mechanic working a 5 day 40hr. 
 week.I have had this job 20yrs.the pay
 is good ,but the working facilities   
 need improving.                       </content>
