		<title>12Heanton Parish Church.</title>
		<content> When{William the Conqueror}took over  
 England he took over{Heanton manor,}  
 and one of his followers became it's  
 lord. One of his descendants built{St.
{Augustine's church.}The present vicar 
 of the church has a variety of jobs   
 e.g the parstoral care of people in   
 the parish.This means visiting the    
 sick, and marrying people,conducting  
 funerals,baptisms etc.The hopes of the
 Reverand are that people continue to  
 go to church and live in a Christian  
 way.He fears that man trusts too much 
 in himself, that he sees little need  
 for God who can do so much for him.The
 church receives quite a few visitors, 
 especially in the mornings, although  
 this tends to be more from historical 
 interest, rather than from a religious
 point of view.
