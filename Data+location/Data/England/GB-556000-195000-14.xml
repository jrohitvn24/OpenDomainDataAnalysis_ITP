		<content>   I spend the weekends as a voluntary 
 helms man at Bradwell Sailing Centre. 
 Breakfast on Sunday is at 8.15.When I 
 arrive at 8.30 I'm left with stewed   
 tea.Work begins at 9.00.My job is     
 lunch preparation,helping making      
 sandwiches.The course arrive about    
 10.00,when in waterproofs and life    
 jackets we sort out who's with whom,  
 row them out to their dinghys and go  
 through our personal teaching         
 routines.When the safety boat's ready 
 we sail out of the creek and gather in
 the collecting area,follow lead boat  
 until lunchtime which is on the beach.
 During the sail home doing manoeuvres 
 improving basic skills,usually we have
 water fights.Once on our mooring,     
 everything goes ashore and is sorted  
 out.Lock up-5.30.Into the yacht club  
 before going home.When I arrive home  
 sort myself out and go to bed.        </content>
