		<title>12 Leisure Survey</title>
		<content>On Wednesday we went to Sevenoaks High 
Street to do a survey on leisure. Mrs  
Samways went with us and she started us
off. Lots of people were very pleased  
to help us but some people could not be
bothered. 28 out of 37 people enjoy    
reading, 20 of the people we asked     
lived in Sevenoaks and out of reading  
most people liked non fiction. The most
popular sports are football and tennis.
The most popular T.V. programmes are   
Wild Life and The News. We interviewed 
9 men and 28 women. The most unpopular 
way of passing spare time was jogging. 
Altogether we interviewed 37 people. 2 
out of 4 people use the new swimming   
pool.
