		<content> Services in this area are almost non  
 existant with no public transport of  
 any kind, no school, shop, garage or  
 public house. The Mobile Library stops
 in the village once a week and refuse 
 is collected bi-weekly. For all other 
 services the village is reliant on    
 helping its own community. The Church 
 of St.Mary's is the focal point of the
 village and there is a  newly built   
 village hall which is used for a table
 tennis club and private functions     
 only. The Womens Institute for the    
 area is located at the nearby village 
 of Stanford.
