 There are also reduced fees for

 A recent development in the area has  
 been the opening of Briggens Hotel    
 which is situated in Briggens Park,   
 north-east of Roydon. Access to the   
 hotel is either from the north side of
 the level-crossing at Roydon or from  
 the A 414. The Hotel grounds contain a
 nine-hole golf course, but this is    
 used mostly by hotel guests, many of  
 whom are attending small business con-
 ventions - an important part of the   
 hotel's business policy.              
 There is only one public hall in the  
 area. This is Roydon Village Hall,    
 which has been partly altered in      
 recent years and is well used by local
 amateurs for plays, as well as for the
 many other village activities.
