		<content> The first Young Farmer's Club was     
 started around Hemyock in l921 with   
 calf-rearing.This club is well        
 supported,as are the many Scouting and
 Guiding groups serving the Culm Valley
 area. The several churches encourage  
 groups including Mother's Union.A     
 flourishing Women's Institute with a  
 variety of interests and entertainment
 meets monthly throughout the year. All
 forms of country pursuit are supported
 mainly hunting,shooting,trout fishing,
 motor-bike scrambling,horse riding    
 from the local riding school or       
 privately owned horses or ponies.     
 Other than this there are manifold    
 activities ranging from calligraphy,  
 cricket,tennis,football to amateur    
 operatics.Inhabitants have to be self-
 motivated and mobile to partake of    
 interests in the local towns.The most 
 popular interest is television.       </content>
