 400 trailers, 4 coaches and 8 cranes. 
 They will carry anything, but mainly  
 carry steel for British Steel.Down at 
 Thorpes in the first shed a man put a 
 car on a ramp which was powered by    
 hydrailic rams.Then we went into      
 the lettering shed and there was a    
 truck being done up.The lettering was 
 in gold leaf.A man showed us how to   
 make a box out of metal.              
  LASER stands for light amplication
