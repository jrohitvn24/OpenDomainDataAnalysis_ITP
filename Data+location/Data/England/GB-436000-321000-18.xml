		<content> The area provides a wealth of         
 opportunities for walkers.It is criss-
 crossed with paths varying from wide  
 bridle paths &amp; metalled roads to very 
 narrow overgrown tracks.Sign posts are
 plentiful particularly for those paths
 which lie in the County of            
 Leicestershire and many of the paths  
 are well trodden. Some paths are      
 difficult to trace to their conclusion
 &amp; not all the farmers welcome         
 visitors; some actually discourage    
 them by covering footpath signs or    
 planting over the paths. But for those
 walkers who do manage to find their   
 way,the gently undulating landscape   
 will provide a variety of pleasurable 
 walks.
