		<content> The countryside is slightly hilly and 
 lies between 350 and 550 feet above   
 sea level. There are several streams  
 which flow into the small River Ive   
 which is in a deep valley.            
 There is a mixture of grassland and   
 woodland with a few fields of corn,   
 oil seed rape and turnips.            
 Field boundaries are mainly hedges,   
 with some post and wire fences.       
 Houses and farms are scattered        
 throughout the area. There are few    
 concentrations of buildings. The older
 houses are built of a greyish pink    
 sandstone, which is the local         
 underlying rock.
