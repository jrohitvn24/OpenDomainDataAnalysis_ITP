		<title>02ETTINGTON PARK HOTEL</title>
		<content>  Ettington Hall was completed in      
 1862. It was originally the home of   
 the Shirley family,one of the oldest  
 families in Britain.They were able to 
 trace their ancestors directly back to
 Saxon times.For the past hundred years
 it had been the property of the       
 Underhill family, descendants of the  
 Shirleys.                             
  The Hall is set in beautifully laid  
 out park land with many stately cedar 
 and wellingtonia trees.The River      
 Stour runs through the grounds.Most of
 the park around the hall is used as   
 grazing land for cattle and sheep.The 
 hall is built in the gothic style with
 lots of turrets and towers.Around the 
 outside is a frieze showing the       
 history of the Shirley family.        
 Inside the hall, now a hotel, has been
 carefully modernised, keeping the     
 frontage in its original state.       </content>
