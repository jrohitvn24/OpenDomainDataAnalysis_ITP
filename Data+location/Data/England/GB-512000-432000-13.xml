  The oldest children are 9. There are 
 only 207 children in the primary now, 
 but 120 in the nursery (60 attend     
 mornings only, and 60 afternoons only)
 The primary children are in 9 classes.
 The smallest class has 17 children and
 the rest have between 20-29. In the   
 primary school there are 9 class      
 teachers and a head teacher. In the   
 nursery there are two teachers and    
 four nursery nurses teaching the      
 children in six groups. A teacher     
 visits the primary for several hours  
 each week to help children with       
 reading difficulties.                 
                                       
   From 1988, the school, like all     
 primary schools in Hull, will again   
 have children up to the age of 11.
