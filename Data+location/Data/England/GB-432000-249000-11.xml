		<content> The{Police}Station was built 35 years 
 ago, replacing the old Police Station 
 which is now a private house.  The    
 Station is not always manned but there
 is a telephone to contact the Police  
 quickly.  The Station covers 250      
 square miles including Gaydon, Tysoe  
 and Wellesbourne and, of course,      
 Kineton.  10 P.Cs and 1 Sergeant are  
 stationed at Kineton.  They have a    
 Land Rover, Vans and an Austin        
 Ambassador for travelling fast.       
   There is a{Magistrates Court}in     
 Bridge Street.  It was built as a     
 private house in 1808 and was first   
 used as a courthouse 25 years ago.    
 The court usually opens once a        
 fortnight on a Wednesday.  The        
 Juvenile court is upstairs.  The      
 maximum punishment that can be        
 administered is 6 months imprisonment 
 or a Â£2,000 fine.                     </content>
