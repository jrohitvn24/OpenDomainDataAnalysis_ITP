		<title>09KEEPING A PONY.</title>
		<content> In 1981 I bought a pony called Pam, I 
 didn't ralise how much trouble and    
 hard work I was in for. At first my   
 dad got a nasty kick. We kept Pam at  
 Middlethorpe Farm but she only stayed 
 there one week because it was Â£5.50 a 
 week not including a stable. Once when
 I was just going  to mount Pam, a cat 
 ran under her legs. She reared up and 
 broke her saddle and snapped her reins
 I had to buy a new saddle and bridle. 
 Then I went to Middle Warren Farm. One
 day I clipped the leading rope onto   
 Pam's head collar but she wouldn't    
 move even though I pulled and patted  
 her. My dad phoned the vet and she had
 to get an x ray. I discovered that she
 had fractured her cannon (a leg bone) 
 I kept her a bit longer and then sold 
 her.
