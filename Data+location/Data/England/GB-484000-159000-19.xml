		<title>19The Royal Military Academy</title>
		<content> In 1812 the army bought some land in  
 Sandhurst on which they built the     
 Sandhurst Royal Military Academy. The 
 site covers about 1000 acres to the   
 north of the A30. It was originally   
{scrubby moor and heath land}owned     
 by Parliament, with a house at the    
 bottom of the grounds called          
 Parliament House.                     
                                       
 The army uses Sandhurst to train its  
{officer cadets}and they are a familiar
 sight around town, dressed in off-duty
 grey flannels and sports jackets.     
                                       
 The Staff College (for senior ranks)  
 is on the same site and many foreign  
 armies send their top men to train    
 there, creating a small but noticeable
 transient foreign population because  
 most bring their wives (in some cases 
 several) and families with them.      </content>
