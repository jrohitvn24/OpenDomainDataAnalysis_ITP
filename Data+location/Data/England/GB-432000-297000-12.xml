		<content> Witherley Playing Field was opened in 
 1955 as a memorial to those men from  
 the village who served and died in the
 Second World War. It was opened by    
 Mr D R Stokes, Chairman of the Market 
 Bosworth Rural District Council. It   
 was developed on what used to be      
 pasture land owned by the church.     
                                       
 There is a Playing Field Committee,   
 who raise money to keep the field in  
 good order, organising events such as 
 a New Year's Eve dance, and a "Field  
 Day" which comprises games and sports,
 with stalls, raffles and bingo.       
                                       
 People are asked not to take dogs on  
 to the field, and to take care that   
 no-one is put in danger if they are   
 playing with a hard ball.
