		<title>09FARMING.CALCOT,READING</title>
		<content> The Calcot area up until the end of   
 the 2nd World War was used largely for
 farming.Since that time increasing    
 amounts of land have been bought and  
 built upon.                           
   The main type of farming was arable 
 and dairy.In the 1960's one herd      
 contained over 100 cows.Now all that  
 is gone.Some fields in the North East 
 of the Calcot area are still used to  
 grow cereal crops but this may not    
 continue for long,since housing       
 development is planned in that area.  
   Some fields are used for grazing    
 horses,but these are fields which     
 would otherwise remain fallow.        
   As Calcot grows,and all the open    
 space gets built upon,it will         
 eventually become a suburb of Reading.
 At that time its past association with
 farming will be broken.
