		<content> They have to shut down in winter      
 because there is not enough business  
 but sometimes private boats do pass   
 through.                              
                                       
    They are cut off where they live   
 and have to get everything themselves.
{They spend Â£1020 on petrol a year     
 which covers all their transport costs
{ The milkman leaves milk about half a 
{mile away and only delivers when he   
{comes to collect his bill.            
                                       
    They don't get much chance to go   
 away because they can't afford to shut
 the shop.{Their last proper holiday   
{was in 1962.}They have no social life 
 because this also means shutting the  
 shop.
