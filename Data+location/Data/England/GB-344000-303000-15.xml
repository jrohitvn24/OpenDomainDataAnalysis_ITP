		<title>15LONGDEN SCHOOL (CONT)</title>
		<content> the school has a small playground area
 and large playing fields. The         
 buildings include four classrooms     
 connected by an activity area, a large
 hall and a canteen. School meals are  
 cooked on the premises and            
 approximately 50% of the school stay  
 to school lunch. The other 50% bring  
 their own sandwiches. No children go  
 home to lunch.                        
   Because of the large catchment area 
 of the school a coach brings children 
 from the Pulverbatch area and a       
 mini-bus brings children from the     
 Hook-a-gate area.
