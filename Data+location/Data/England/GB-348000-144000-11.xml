		<content>  East Court Manor is at present a     
 guest house and is owned by Mr. and   
 Mrs. C.J.Rowland and Mrs.W.Evans. The 
 previous owners were Mr. and          
 Mrs.G.Dyer who ran it as an old       
 people's home. The house was          
 originally built by the Salmon family 
 who were merchants and traders.       
  The grounds extend to four and a half
 acres and there are two self-catering 
 cottages. The coach house and the     
 stables have been converted into      
 accommodation. The house itself has   
 five reception rooms and eleven       
 bedrooms.                             
  An interesting story is connected    
 with the Perkins family who lived at  
 East Court for many years. Colonel    
 Perkins shot himself and his wife shut
 up the house and lived on her own     
 until finally she was admitted to the 
 Mendip Hospital in l97O.              </content>
