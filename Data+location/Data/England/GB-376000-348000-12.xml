		<title>12TRANSPORT TO SCHOOL</title>
		<content>The aim of this project is to find out 
how people get to school and how long  
it takes them to travel the distance.I 
also aim to discover the area the      
school gives a service to.I did a      
survey of 84 children between the ages 
of 12 &amp; 13 which is our second year.   
The results were as follows:-          
  DISTANCE(KM)   TRANSPORT   TIME(MIN) 
   &lt;1=14          WALK=52      >10=35  
  1-2=29          BIKE= 7    11-20=21  
  2-3=40          CAR =16    21-30=19  
   >3= 1          BUS = 9      >30= 9  
TRANSPORT: Although 48% of the pupils  
live >2km away it is suprising that the
majority of them still make their own  
way to school.Many of them walk or bike
along the course of the old railway    
line which ends at the school gate.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
