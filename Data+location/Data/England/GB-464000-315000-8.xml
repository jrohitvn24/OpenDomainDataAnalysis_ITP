		<title>08THE RAILWAY NEAR HOBY - 2</title>
		<content> Hoby did not have a railway station   
 just a railway line.                  
                                       
 The line from Leicester to London     
 might be electrified &amp; hopefully the  
 A.P.T.running from Leicester. That is 
 what the British Rail area manager for
 Leicestershire has got in mind for the
 late 1990,s.But neither Hoby nor      
 Melton Mowbray will be                
 electrified.British Rail are using the
 Leicester to Peterborough line for    
 tests on Sundays. Some of them come   
 from the Old Dalby Test track which   
 tests theories of British Rails       
 Technical Designers like for instance 
 for GEC who crashed Locomotive        
 No.46009 into a nuclear flask at      
 100mph.                               
                                       
 On any train that passes Hoby you     
 can see all of the village.           </content>
