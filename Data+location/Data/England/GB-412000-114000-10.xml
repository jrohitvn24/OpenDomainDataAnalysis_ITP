		<title>10Augustus John.</title>
		<content>        {Augustus John}was born in 1878
 and studied art at The Slade School,  
 London. As he became more famous he   
 became richer and was able to buy     
 Fryern Court in 1928.                 
   {Fryern Court}was originally a      
 monastery called Frerern Court. The   
 name was then changed to Fryern Court.
    The main part of the house was     
 designed in 1805. In 1932 the Johns   
 asked Christopher Nicholson to design 
 the front part of the house (front    
 door and windows) and a room going    
 off to the side.                      
    It is a Grade two listed building  
 which means everything the owners want
 renewed has to be made exactly like   
 the original. Augustus' new studio    
 has now been turned into flats.       
 In the Recreation Ground, on the bank 
 of the River Avon,{a statue}of this   
 famous artist can be seen.            </content>
