		<content>        {A day in my life.             
  'I get up at about 9.00a.m.on a      
 Saturday and then have a cup of       
 coffee.Most Saturdays my brother goes 
 to band practice after fighting with  
 me.My mam,dad and me go to do boring  
 shopping.I do not like shopping since 
 I lost one of my best earrings!       
  Nearly every Saturday we go to the   
 'Causey Arch'for lunch.I have         
 scampi.When we get back from lunch    
 I have an argument with my brother    
 as to who has to clean out our        
 hamsters cage.Some afternoons we go to
 a fete or a garden centre or maybe    
 more boring shopping.When we get home 
 we have tea and I stay up late.My     
 favourite supper is pizza or curry    
 rolls.I go to bed at 10.00p.m.My room 
 is very messy-mum calls it the        
 pigsty.I like to read until 11.00.'
