 Most children go to three schools     
 between 5 and 16 or 18. The children  
 at Alban Middle School at Great       
 Barford first went to a Lower School -
 some of these are very small because  
 less children are being born.         
 Some Lower Schools, like Tempsford    
 School have recently closed or may do 
 so in the future. Some people say once
 a school is too small it is too       
 expensive to run.                     
 Most children travel by coach from    
 smaller villages like Renhold, Roxton,
 Ravensden, Mogerhanger, Wilden and    
 Colmworth each day to Alban School. At
 present there are about 370 at Alban. 
 Middle Schools take pupils from age 9 
 to 13. Then they go to an Upper School
 - either in Bedford or Sandy until    
 they leave.
