		<title>09Wilmington Village</title>
		<content> Wilmington Village is a mixture of old
 and new houses. As one walks south    
 through the village the first notable 
 house on the right is Rose            
 Cottage. This is a 15th Century timber
 framed house with a tiled roof and    
 latticed windows. Beyond Ades Field is
 Pond Cottage with a half thatched     
 roof. The oldest house in the village 
 is Hunters Dene built in an L shape.  
 The Chantry is another thatched       
 building. If you look above the door  
 there is a carved head,supposedly a   
 caricature of an earlier vicar.       
                                       
 There are many clues about the history
 of the village in the house names such
 as the Old Bakehouse,Old Inn House and
 Pond Cottage.
