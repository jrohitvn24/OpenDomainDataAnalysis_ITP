		<title>08NEW SCHOOL IN MILTON KEYNES</title>
		<content> Giffard Park County Combined School   
 was open on 22.4.85. The opening was  
 delayed by frozen pipes which had     
 thawed and caused a flood. Giffard    
 Park is the newest school in Milton   
 Keynes. In the school there are 16    
 home bases but at the moment only 5   
 classes are being used. Each homebase 
 has a floor area of about 40 square   
 metres. They own 1 video, 2           
 televisions, 1 music centre, records  
 and a computer called Link 480Z. The  
 school is built by a canal and there  
 is the threat of the canal banks      
 breaking and part of the school       
 flooding. Giffard Park School can hold
 480 children but at the moment only   
 157 children go there. The school     
 hours are 8.55 a.m. to 12.00 noon and 
 1.15 p.m. to 3.15 p.m.
