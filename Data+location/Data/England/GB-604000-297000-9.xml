		<content> The buildings in Morley are of        
 different types and ages. There are   
 three large houses which date back    
 several centuries, namely Morley Hall,
 Morley Old Hall and Morley Manor. The 
 other houses are a mixture of old     
 styles and ages. The oldest are of    
 clay lump and have thatched roofs.    
 There are many local sources of       
 thatching material from the           
 Norfolk broads and coastal            
 marshland. The clay was dug up locally
 and many fields still have marl pits  
 tucked away in odd corners. Other     
 houses are of various modern designs  
 including timber frame and board and  
 brick. Many local houses have roofs of
 traditional Norfolk pantiles.
