		<content>{Childs Ercall church was in the       
{Domesday book of 1086.}The church has 
 got a hole, this hole is called a     
 hagioscope or squint, it was put there
 so that people from the south door can
 see the priest and the Altar, you     
 don't often see a hagioscope because  
 most of them have been covered up or  
 filled in. In the church there are    
 three bells one of the bells is       
 possibly original whilst two were     
 re_cast, one in 1620 and one in 1868. 
 There was some extensive work done on 
 the tower in 1984 following an        
 examination of the construction when a
 pinnacle on top broke. The vicar has  
 two parishes; St. Peters Stoke_on_Tern
 and st. Michaels Childs Ercall. Childs
 Ercall has a choir but not            
 Stoke_on_Tern but Stoke_on_Tern has   
 got a sunday school Childs Ercall has 
 not.                                  </content>
