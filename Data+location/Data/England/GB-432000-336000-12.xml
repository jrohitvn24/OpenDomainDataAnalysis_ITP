		<title>12Law and Order in NW Derby</title>
		<content> There are two major police stations.  
 The Divisional Headquarters on Full   
 Street, which also accommodates the   
 Central Sub-divisional HQ, and the    
 West Sub-divisioonal HQ on St. Mary's 
 Gate. There are also local police     
 offices at Kingsway and Park Farm.    
 Derby has a community policing policy 
 which puts more officers on the 'beat'
 patrolling a specific area. A Woman   
 Police Constable came to School and   
 explained that her job was to 'save   
 life and protect property'. The crime 
 detection rate in the County was 54.3%
 in 1984.                              
 The Magistrates Courts deal with      
 juvenile matters at Bold Lane and     
 adult cases at Derwent Street. There  
 is also a Crown Court Office on       
 Queen's Street.
