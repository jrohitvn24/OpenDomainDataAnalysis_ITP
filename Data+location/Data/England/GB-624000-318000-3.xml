		<title>03Coltishall children (2 of 2)</title>
		<content> Some of the differences we noticed    
 when we delivered the questionnaire   
 was that the school was much smaller  
 than ours, the buildings were older   
 and that their headmaster was a       
 teacher as well!                      
                                       
 We decided that the children of       
{Coltishall}were worse off than us in  
 quite a lot of ways. They had no      
 entertainment even nearby, like we    
 have in the city. They have no First  
 Division Team to follow, the shops are
 poor compared to Norwich, especially  
 there are no computer shops. The main 
 hospital is in the city.              
                                       
 There were some advantages; the       
 scenery, healthy air and open         
 countryside.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
