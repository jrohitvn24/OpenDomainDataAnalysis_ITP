		<content> WINTER TIME                           
 It is five o'clock                    
 Already it is dark                    
 We've got a nice warm fire            
 Outside you can see our snowman with  
 its scarf and hat on.                 
 The car all frozen up                 
 The trees with the snow on the        
 branches                              
 The birds searching for food          
 The icicles hanging from the garage   
 Now its dinner we have got hot toast  
 with butter oozing out.               
 Afterwards I will probably sit in     
 front of the fire and play a game.    
 In the morning I will most likely ask 
 one of my friends to play.            
 Then go out on our sledges and have   
 snowball fights.                      
 Then we will go skating on the pond.  
 I think its going to be great fun     
 tomorrow!                             </content>
