		<content> The Intimate Theatre in Green Lanes   
 was built in 1935 as a Roman Catholic 
 Parish Hall, but it was too big and   
 was turned into a theatre. Sir John   
 Clements owned it until 1968 as a     
 repertory theatre. From 1968-79 it was
 an amateur venue, until Rob Dixon, the
 present owner, bought it and it became
 a joint venue. All kinds of plays are 
 performed there, musicals, some light 
 opera but no ballet, and a pantomime  
 once a year. It is the only theatre in
 the south of England that is not      
 subsidised and relies solely on the   
 box office and eight carnivals a year.
 There are 430 seats-100 in the circle 
 and 330 downstairs with 4 wheel-chair 
 spaces. Many famous people have       
 performed there eg.Roger Moore, Jake  
 Thakray, and like all theatres it has 
 a'ghost'and one can sense its presence
 in the auditorium.                    </content>
