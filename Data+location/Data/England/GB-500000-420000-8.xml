		<content> Nowadays{Providence House}is used as a
 public{library}and an{adult education 
{centre.}The library has, on average,  
 100 visitors a day and the adult      
 education centre offers a wide variety
 of daytime and evening classes.       
 Providence House was built in the     
 19th.Century and has been used as a   
 private house, an orphanage and a     
 school. There are many stories told   
 about life in the{orphanage.}Recent   
 visitors recalled a story about a boy 
 who was made to sit in a baby's high  
 chair each mealtime for 3 days as a   
 punishment for crying. Another man    
 visiting the library noticed an       
 alteration in the ceiling and         
 remembered how he and his friends used
 to crawl along the false roof and     
 watch the matron in the bathroom      
 through a hole in the ceiling.
