		<content> Although most of the area is given    
 over to agriculture,this does not     
 provide many work opportunities for   
 the residents. Two or three full-time 
 workers to each farm and seasonal help
 from local women is the general       
 pattern. These women do such tasks as 
 pruning,weeding and fruit picking.    
 Foreman's,which is an Agricultural    
 Merchants, and Woodcock's,which is a  
 Haulage Company provide work for both 
 men and women as office staff,drivers 
 and representatives. The shops and    
 offices within the village employ     
 quite a number of people,some of whom 
 come from outside the immediate area. 
 The majority of people probably work  
 outside the village in towns such as  
 Maidstone,Ashford or the Medway Towns.
 Many commute to London - journey time 
 just over an hour. The unemployment   
 rate is fortunately quite low.        </content>
