		<title>18BIOGRAPHY OF A VILLAGER</title>
		<content>{ How long have you lived in the       
{village?                              
  71 years.                            
{Could you tell us somethong of your   
{school days?                          
  I attended Haslington County Primary 
 School until I was 14.As well as      
 lessons in the "three R's" I was      
 taught to cook and sew and boys from  
 another school came to our school to  
 do woodwork once a week. I had to sit 
 a scholarship when it was time for me 
 to leave to decide whether or not I   
 went on to Grammar School. I failed so
 I left to find employment.            
{What was your work and conditions?    
  I found employment in Crewe as a     
 printing apprentice earning seven     
 shillings and sixpence a week but by  
 the time I left I was earning 30      
 shillings a week.
