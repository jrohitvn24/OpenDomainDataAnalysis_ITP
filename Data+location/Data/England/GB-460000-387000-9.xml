		<title>09BLYTH PLAY GROUP.</title>
		<content> The play group is run by a supervisor 
 assisted by mums on a rota. There is a
 committee which meets once a month    
 where desisions are made and fund     
 raising events discussed as we are a  
 charitable organisation. We have a    
 grant for toys from social services.  
 We like parents to be involved as much
 as possible. Our aims are to let the  
 children learn through play and       
 watching others. We create a happy,   
 safe and secure environment. When     
 children leave the play group we hope 
 they are adjusted to school and can   
 socialise, share and listen. We like  
 to get to know our children but not to
 get too involved with their home      
 lives. You've got to love doing the   
 playgroup. It's no use if it's just a 
 job. It comes across with children    
 they need a happy loving and caring   
 atmosphere.                           </content>
