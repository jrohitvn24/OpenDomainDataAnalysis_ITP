		<title>13SHOPPING ON THE BRIDGE</title>
		<content> We interviewed some people to find out
 why they shopped on the Bridge.Most   
 people lived out of St.Sampsons.They  
 came to the Bridge because it was     
 near, there was enough variety, the   
 parking was easier than Town and they 
 could buy most things they needed so  
 they thought it was worth going there.
 Most people shopped on Friday,usually 
 in the morning.The shopkeepers thought
 Friday was the busiest day.Some people
 said the opening and closing times    
 were good but some would like shops to
 open earlier.Shopkeepers said there   
 was a demand for a late night shopping
 evening.Most people thought Town was  
 busier but the prices were about the  
 same.Everyone thought St.Sampsons     
 could do with a library and some      
 thought a good fish shop and a        
 childrens shoe shop would be handy.
