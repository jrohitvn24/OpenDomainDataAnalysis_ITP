		<title>15Goat-keeping 1:The Deverills</title>
		<content> The goat-keeper began keeping goats in
{Longbridge Deverill}in 1972 when she  
 bought a two year old goat called     
 Bella. Bella was a pedigree{British   
{Toggenburg}and the founder of the     
{Deverill Pedigree Herd.}The herd was  
 gradually built up and now consists   
 of 4O goats,- 2 billy goats, 2O kids  
 and 18 nanny goats for milking. The   
 goats are milked twice a day and give 
 three to six litres of milk. Their    
 milk is whiter and has a different    
 taste to cows' milk. It has smaller   
 fat globules, and is therefore easier 
 to digest and is popular with people  
 who suffer from allergies, the        
 goat-keeper began to keep goats       
 because she suffered with asthma. The 
 milk is frozen after milking and sold 
 naturally, unpasteurised. The milk is 
 also made into yoghurt and sold.
