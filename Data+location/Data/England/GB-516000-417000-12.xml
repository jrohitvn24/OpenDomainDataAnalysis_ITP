		<title>12Pollution In The River</title>
		<content> Many factories are found along the    
 Humber Bank and these all threaten to 
 spoil the environment. Many thousands 
 of pounds are spent on reducing the   
 pollution in the river but many people
 like{Greenpeace}say that not enough is
 being done. In 1985 great concern is  
 felt over the production if Titanium  
 Dioxide. The factory is found down    
 river at Grimsby but with tides in the
 Humber any pollution will be carried  
 up and down the river. The Goverment  
 says that Tioxide is useful but it{   
{should be controlled}and pollution    
 should be limited. The company claim  
 that{the effect of pollution is       
{over-exagerated.}Much has already been
 done to reduce the amount of effluent 
 put into the river. Careful recording 
 of all products put into the river    
 takes place. Local people (especially 
 fishermen) do not agree.              </content>
