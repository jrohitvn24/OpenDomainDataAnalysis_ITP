		<content>   {Skipping}is a game with a skipping 
 rope. A skipping rope is a rope with  
 wooden handles. You have to turn the  
 rope round your head and jump when it 
 comes to your feet. We sing songs     
 about skipping.                       
                                       
   {50}up is a game where somebody has 
 to count to 50 while the other people 
 hide. When the person has counted to  
 50 they have to go and find the other 
 people. If the person sees one of the 
 other people they run to the post. If 
 they get there first they say "50 up".
 If the other person gets there first  
 he or she says "50 up" and frees all  
 the other people.                     
                                       
    When I play outdoors I play on my  
{bike.}A bike is a thing with pedals   
 and it takes you places. It is hard   
 work riding a bike.                   </content>
