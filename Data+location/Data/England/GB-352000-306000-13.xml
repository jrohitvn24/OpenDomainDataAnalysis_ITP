		<title>13GIPSY SITE, CROSS HOUSES</title>
		<content>{At the junction}of the Pitchford road 
 with the main road (A458), there is a 
 small triangular area of land. It was 
 a sand and gravel quarry, then filled 
 in when a rubbish tip and on levelling
 became used by the County  Council for
 storing road gravel etc. About 8 years
 ago 1 or 2 gipsy caravans moved onto  
 this patch. Recently, as many as 6    
 trailers have been based there.       
{The Council}are now agreed to{upgrade 
 the land at the road junction to an   
 official site for about 5 years to    
 accommodate 4 or 5 trailers. Water    
 and toilets will be provided shortly. 
{A permanent site}for travellers is    
 being sought for the Shrewsbury area  
 and there are possibilities it could  
 be in the Cross Houses/Berrington     
 region.
