		<content> The most common forms of transport    
 used by local residents and visitors  
 to the village are the private motor  
 car or motorcycle.Whilst public       
 transport is provided by the National 
 or East Kent bus companies, busses now
 run hourly to Ashford and Maidstone or
 Hythe and Folkestone instead of the 20
 minute service of just a few years    
 ago. This is the only daily public    
 transport in the area,apart from the  
 school bus which is only for pupils of
 Brockhill School.A bus goes to        
 Canterbury and back on Wednesdays and 
 another to Presto supermarket in      
 Folkestone on Fridays,whilst a London 
 bound coach comes through the village 
 twice daily.The nearest railway       
 stations are Westenhangar,over 2 miles
 away,or Ashford,both of which give    
 access to trains travelling in the    
 London or Folkestone directions.      </content>
