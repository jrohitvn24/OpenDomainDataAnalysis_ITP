		<title>17FACTORIES IN SINFIN.</title>
		<content> There are five main factories in      
 Sinfin. They are Qualcast, Raleigh,   
 Reckitt, NEI International Combustion,
 and Rolls-Royce.                      
  Rolls-Royce is the biggest and most  
 important factory in Sinfin. They make
 engines for aeroplanes that are used  
 all over the world. There are more    
 Rolls-Royce factories around Derby.   
  Raleigh isn't far from our school. I 
 sometimes go past the factory and see 
 the bicycles that have been made there
 and the big long delivery lorries.    
  At Reckitts they make shampoo,       
 disinfectants and other cosmetics.    
  International Combustion make parts  
 for power stations it is also a very  
 large factory.                        
  At Qualcast they make lawn mowers.   
 They are the biggest makers of lawn   
 mowers in Britain.
