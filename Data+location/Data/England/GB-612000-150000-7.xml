		<content>{  Badgers}are still very much in      
 evidence in the area. Their sets and  
 dung pits are a common sight and it is
 by no means rare to see them at dusk  
 in certain places.{Foxes}too are      
 common - even bold at times, being    
 spotted in mid-afternoon on open      
 ground and have been known to cause   
 considerable damage to poultry etc.   
 They are still{hunted}with horses and 
 foxhounds.                            
  {Rabbits}cause damage to crops on the
 edge of fields adjacent to their      
 burrows. These can be spotted easily  
 when chalk spoil is excavated,        
 sometimes positioned many metres into 
 a field. These too are hunted, often  
 after dark using a shotgun fired from 
 a Landrover. Hares I have seen rarely.
{Mole}hills can be found occasionally  
 and{grey squirrels}too.
