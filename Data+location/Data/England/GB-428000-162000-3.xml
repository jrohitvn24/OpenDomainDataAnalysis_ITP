		<title>03THE ECOLOGY OF SHALBOURNE-1</title>
		<content> Shalbourne lies close to chalk downs  
 with a mainly greensand subsoil with  
 chalk and clay outcrops. It has its   
 own microclimate, exposed to the west 
 winds and cold air rolling off the    
 plain, but in summer it is often drier
 than surrounding villages.            
 The area is{designated for special    
{conservation.}A network of 49 old     
 footpaths is recorded: only about 20  
 are still in regular use. The lush    
 growth of nettles/grass requires      
 determined voluntary effort to keep   
 them open in summer. Though fields    
 have been enlarged for economic       
 farming,{bush hedgerows still survive 
 giving cover for much wildlife. There 
 are extensive{deciduous woodlands}at  
 Stype and near Great Bedwyn with many 
 fine old oak trees. There is some wet-
 land and an old{watercress bed}fed by 
 two 70ft bores and by Shalbourne brook</content>
