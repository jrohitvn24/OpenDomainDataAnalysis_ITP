		<title>07HIGH HURSTWOOD FARM PEOPLE</title>
		<content> There are 9 farmers and 10 employed   
 workers, including 2 managers. 6 wives
 or daughters help part-time. 8 full-  
 time workers are employed to look     
 after horses, casual labour is also   
 used. Wages at age 20 or over are     
 Â£89.70 basic, Â£103.16 for craftsmen.  
 There are 7 tied cottages. The Farm   
 Contractor, hiring out large equip-   
 ment is vital to the modern farmer.   
 Although most farmers would not want  
 any other way of life they are        
 pessimistic about the future. They    
 accept the long hours and continual   
 battle with the weather (particularly 
 bad in 1985) but feel "squeezed" by   
 the Common Market and report that     
 income is far down on lO - l5 years   
 ago. It is a case of survival of the  
 fittest.
