		<title>08Sutton Courtenay Church.</title>
		<content>    In the village of Sutton Courtenay 
 there is a{church}which is 900 years  
 old. In the first place the church was
 part of Abingdon Abbey. There are some
 fifteenth century pews and one of them
 looks like the tree it was made of!   
 During the English Civil War the east 
 window was blown out and the church   
 was used as a gunpowder store.        
    In the{churchyard}the vicar showed 
 us the grave of Eric Arthur Blair. He 
 is better known as the writer George  
 Orwell. In 1948 Orwell wrote a book   
 called 1984 which was supposed to be  
 his vision of Britain in 1984. It is  
 not a very nice description and I am  
 glad that his prediction did not come 
 true. I do not think that Big Brother 
 is watching me!
