		<title>08WOODLAND IN THE AREA</title>
		<content>     The largest area of{woodland}is   
 on the{Boconnoc Estate.}This area is  
 managed by a{Head Forester}and{two    
{Forestry workers.}There is a mixture  
 of{hard wood}and{soft wood}on the     
 estate, which is sold for a variety of
 uses. Much is used for{fencing posts  
 and as{pulp wood. }Some is sold to the
{South Crofty Tin Mine}at Camborne for 
{pit props.                            
     As areas are cut so               
{re-aforestation}takes place,this      
 maintains the productivity of the     
 woodland and also provides{cover}for  
 the{game birds}which are reared on the
 estate. It also however provides cover
 for various{preditors,}particularly   
 foxes.                                
     At several points along the       
 woodland tracks are old{water troughs 
 which were used to water horses years 
 ago.                                  </content>
