		<title>10LOCAL SHOPPING AREA, HARROW.</title>
		<content>  {Hatch End}boasts many{restaurants,  
 catering for all tastes and pockets!  
 residents can choose from a wide      
 variety of cuisine:{Greek, Chinese,   
{Indian}or{European.}The "Akropolis" is
 a Greek restaurant and food is bought 
 fresh in the morning and cooked on the
 premises. There are two "take-away"   
 facilities: a{fish and chip shop}and a
{pizza parlour.}For a shopping area of 
 this size, there are more restaurants 
 than would be expected. This reflects 
 the affluence of a London suburb such 
 as Hatch End, and the fact that adult 
 entertainment revolves around "eating 
 out".                                 
   Many of the other shops in Hatch End
 are expensive and range from fashion  
 shops and speciality food and         
 confectionary outlets to tobacconists.
 The most popular shop is Budgens:a    
 supermarket.                          </content>
