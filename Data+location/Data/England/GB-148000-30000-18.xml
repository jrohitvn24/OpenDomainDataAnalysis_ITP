		<title>18TRANSPORT IN THE GULVAL AREA</title>
		<content>{Buses}are the only public transport   
 serving the area. Services have been  
 cut recently, particularly during the 
 school holidays, and are less         
 convenient. The{railway}line to       
 Penzance lies just above the beach.   
 Access to the beach is by a new       
 footbridge across the line, or a level
 crossing. There is a locomotive       
 servicing depot at Long Rock. The most
 convenient form of transport is a     
 private{car.}Most visitors come by    
 car. The A30 road to Penzance, which  
 lies beside the railway, is very busy,
 especially in summer, when there are  
 long queues of slow-moving traffic at 
 times. There are plans to build a     
 much-needed by-pass around Long Rock. 
 The high density of summer traffic    
 also brings hazards to users of the   
 narrow winding lanes which are an     
 attractive feature of the country-side</content>
