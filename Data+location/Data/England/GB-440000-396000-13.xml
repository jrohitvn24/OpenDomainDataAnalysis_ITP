    The landscaped grounds of Wentworth
 Park contain one of England's finest  
 stately homes,{Wentworth Woodhouse.   
    The park contains many interesting 
 features including many of the        
 estate's 21 monuments. Among the best 
 known of these are{Hoober Stand,}the  
{Needle's Eye}and the{Mausoleum.}This  
 last commemorates the second Marquis  
 of Rockingham, twice Prime Minister of
 Great Britain. Today mining subsidence
 prohibits public access to these      
 monuments but their preservation is   
 the concern of the{Wentworth Amenities
{Trust}formed in 1979.                 
    There are also bridges, a bear-pit,
 estate lodges, sunken gardens, temples
 and a grotto.                         
    There is also a deershed - the park
 having a herd of seventy red deer.
