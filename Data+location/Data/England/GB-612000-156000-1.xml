		<title>01Canterbury and Planning</title>
		<content>    Canterbury is a religious centre, a
 market town, a centre for learning, a 
 place to live and work, a tourist     
 centre and the shopping and service   
 centre for East Kent.                 
    The broad{planning}strategy for    
 Canterbury is defined in the local    
 plan. This plan recognises the special
 character of the built{environment,}  
 but also acknowledges the city's many 
 and diverse functions.                
    The plan allows for a small        
 population increase up to 1991. To    
 meet this 2800{dwellings}are planned  
 for within the present urban area. To 
 provide for jobs, the plan sees growth
 in retail, tourism, recreation,       
 education and health services.        
    Canterbury is to be maintained as a
 sub-regional{shopping}centre, with    
 continual expansion of non-food /     
 company shops.                        </content>
