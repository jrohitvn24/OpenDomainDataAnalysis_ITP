    The{Macclesfield Canal}runs through
 our area.It carries mostly holiday    
 boats now, although it was built to   
 serve the many mills that sprang up   
 during the Industrial Revolution.It   
 links up the Midlands and the Cheshire
 ring.There are no locks on it, but    
 there are rows of bridges which       
 are numbered.The canal passes through 
{High Lane and Poynton}where there is a
 Marina.The tow paths are in quite good
 condition and it is possible to walk  
 along them without getting too muddy. 
    There is plenty to look at as you  
 walk alongside the canal.Blackberries 
 are growing and there are many        
 different kinds of plants and flowers 
 to enjoy.  There are fish in the      
 canals as well as smalll mammals like 
 water voles.
