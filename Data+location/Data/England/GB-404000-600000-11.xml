		<title>11Rothbury Carnival</title>
		<content> This has been the first year without  
 Rothbury Carnival. It was normally    
 held on an area of land called the    
 "Haugh" but this site was not         
 available last year so the organisers 
 moved the event to Pauperhaugh, not   
 far from here.                        
 The last carnival in Rothbury was in  
 the high street. There were a lot of  
 stalls including a coconut shy and    
 near the end of the day they sold off 
 at a cheap rate any coconuts they     
 thought were bad.                     
 There was also a Highland Pipe Band   
 and if you asked the drummers nicely  
 they would let you bang the drums.    
 There was also a beer tent at the     
 carnival and some people who had taken
 too much to drink ended up in the     
 river, especially if it was a sunny   
 day.                                  
                                       </content>
