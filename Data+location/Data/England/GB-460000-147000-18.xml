		<title>18SW BASINGSTOKE: SHOPPING</title>
		<content> There are two shopping centres at {   
{Brighton Hill}and{Kempshott,}serving  
 large housing estates. The village of{
{Cliddesden}has a combined Post        
 Office/shop, but at {Farleigh}is just 
 a small General Store. People use     
 these shops only for convenience as   
 their prices are higher, so they tend 
 to go to Brighton Hill or Basingstoke 
 for their main weekly shopping.       
    At Brighton Hill there are free car
 parks near a large Sainsbury's        
 supermarket. There is a ten pence     
 deposit to use a trolley to wheel the 
 shopping to your car. Altogether there
 are thirteen shops at the centre      
 including a chip shop, bank, chemist, 
 hair-dresser and newsagent/post       
 office. The shops are open six days a 
 week.
