WI: My husband went to work at 7.00am. 
Our children are on school holiday so I
left them with my mother before going  
to work at 8.30.Home at ll.45, did     
house work &amp; washing before a snack    
lunch.At 1.00 an elderly friend        
telephoned to ask me to clean up for   
her after the chimney sweep.Taking the 
children in the car, I arrived at      
2.00pm.After a chat,I did the cleaning 
while the children fished in a nearby  
river.They arrived back at 4.30pm with 
feet &amp; trousers very wet.Home again at 
5.l5pm,the children got clean clothes  
and I did more house work and prepared 
dinner.My husband arrived home at      
about  7.00pm.The children have a bath 
at   9.00pm &amp; go to bed. I have a bath 
then sit down,with a cup of coffee to  
watch television then went to bed at   
about 11.00pm.                         </content>
