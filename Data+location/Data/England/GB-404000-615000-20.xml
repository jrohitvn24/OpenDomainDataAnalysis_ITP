		<title>20A typical family weekend</title>
		<content> My name is Charlotte. I am eight years
 old and I live on a farm which is     
 just over the road from the school I  
 go to.                                
 On Saturday morning, like every other 
 day, my daddy is the first up. He has 
 to go out at about seven o'clock to   
 see what has to be done on the farm   
 that day. I get up at about eight     
 o'clock and I usually have coffee and 
 cheese on toast for breakfast.        
 Mum, Robert (my little brother) and   
 I usually go into Alnwick to do the   
 shopping on Saturday morning.In the   
 afternoons we go to the rugby         
 club.Some Saturdays I go hunting, if  
 Granda is going. On alternate Sunday  
 mornings we go to church at 11.00     
 a.m.After church I have a piano lesson
 because my teacher is the church      
 organist. I enjoy Sunday dinner which 
 is roast meat, potatoes and vegetables</content>
