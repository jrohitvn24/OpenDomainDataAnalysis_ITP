		<title>07HUNTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> OUR AREA WAS IN HUNTON VILLAGE. WE    
 STARTED AT THE SCHOOL, WHICH WAS BUILT
 IN 1963, MAKING IT JUST 22 YEARS      
 OLD.THIS MAKES IT VERY MODERN INDEED. 
 THERE WERE 42 CHILDREN WHEN THE SCHOOL
 WAS FIRST BUILT, AND WHEN THE PRESENT 
 HEADMASTER,MR.KEMP CAME THERE WERE 64 
 CHILDREN BUT NOW THERE ARE ONLY 36.   
 THERE ARE ALMS HOUSES NEXT TO THE     
 SCHOLL WHICH ARE OWNED BY THE CHURCH. 
 THERE ARE NO SHOPS, JUST A POST       
 OFFICE. THE MOST RECENT SHOP TO BE    
 CLOSED IS THE GROCER'S.               
 ACROSS THE ROAD FROM THE SCHOOL IS A  
 ROW OF HOUSES - QUITE NEW, ABOUT 5-6  
 YEARS OLD.                            
 THERE IS A VILLAGE HALL BY THE        
 TELEPHONE BOX AND THE LOCAL PEOPLE    
 CALL IT A "WORKING-MENS"CLUB.         
 ORIGINALLY THE HOUSES IN BENSTEAD     
 CLOSE WERE COUNCIL OWNED - NOW THEY   
 ARE PRIVATELY OWNED.                  </content>
