		<content> EDGWARE POLICE STATION                
    5 police officers are assigned to  
 Edgware Police Station to deal with   
 ordinary police business. The station 
 is controlled from Wealdstone Police  
 Station in "Q" Division. Because the  
 building is large, but with a limited 
 operational role, it is also used to  
 store police records. About 230 people
 visit the station each day. 1 or 2    
 murders are reported to the station   
 per year.                             
                                       
 PUBLIC OPINION OF THE POLICE          
    7 people were interviewed on the   
 subject. 5 of them said the police did
 an excellent job. The others          
 (unemployed, black youths) said they  
 thought the police were racially      
 prejudiced. 1 interviewee singled out 
 the speed with which complaints were  
 dealt with for praise.                </content>
