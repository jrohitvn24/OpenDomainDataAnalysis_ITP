		<title>11Conservation: A Local View</title>
		<content> Mr Fred Hunt of Immingham is an       
 amateur naturalist who has taken a    
 keen interest in{conservation.}Living 
 and working in the area for many years
 he has observed wildlife. His record  
 of the variety of species is          
 impressive but he{fears for the future
 of nature in the area. A list of once 
 common species now absent or under    
 threat include;{Badger(seven killed   
{this year)Vole, Shrew,Red Squirrel    
{(once found in Burkingshaws Covert)   
{Corn Mouse,Frog,Toad,Swan.}           
   Fred accepts the need for progress  
 but would like to see more concern    
 given to ecology. Different{habitats  
{could be protected}and money spent on 
 reducing the damage to the environment
 would be well spent.New developments  
 like underground gas stores can be set
 up with attempts to minimize damage to
 the environment.                      </content>
