		<content>  The only public transport in the area
 is provided by the National Red and   
 White buses. Their services X73, 31   
 and 38 go through hourly. The X73 goes
 along the A48 to Newport and Cardiff. 
 The 31 goes along the A48 to          
 Cinderford and Coleford in the Forest 
 of Dean. The 38 goes along the A40 to 
 Hereford. In the other direction all  
 the buses go to Gloucester. There are 
 some works buses which pick people up 
 to take them to work.                 
  Although we have a railway line      
 passing through, there is no station  
 nearer than Gloucester.               
  The lack of public transport means   
 that most people have to rely on cars.
