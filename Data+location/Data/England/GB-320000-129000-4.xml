		<title>04IVYTON FARM</title>
		<content> This farmer has been on Ivyton farm   
 for 30 years and his father before him
 and his father before him. This       
 stretches back to 1916. Since he began
 farming it has changed quite a lot.   
 The use of fertilizer and the         
 introduction of new crops have        
 increased production a great deal.    
 More people have also come to work on 
 the farm so work is done more quickly.
      The work is not particularly     
 difficult as it is on the edge of the 
 Quantocks, but the hill slopes can    
 make things awkward. In the winter it 
 gets very difficult when you have to  
 feed the animals twice a day          
      Altogether there are 325 acres   
 and 200 acres are ploughed. This farm 
 is a grade 3 farm which is below      
 average. There are 3 enterprises- 100 
 acres of corn, 100 acres of beef      
 cattle and the rest ploughed.         </content>
