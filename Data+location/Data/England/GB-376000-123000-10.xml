		<title>10Main drainage for East Stour</title>
		<content> Many village houses are built of local
 stone from quarries long since worked 
 out. One such old quarry at East Stour
 beside the A.30 road,has seen much    
 activity lately.On the other side of  
 the road,a new sewerage plant is being
 constructed. The spoil from the site  
 is being taken by dumper trucks across
 the road to fill in the quarry.Here a 
 bulldozer levels the earth and soon it
 will be dressed with topsoil and grass
 seed to become a field again. For more
 than a year the village streets have  
 been opened up to lay the new pipes.  
 East Stour looks forward to the end of
 1985 when it will at last be on main  
 drainage.
