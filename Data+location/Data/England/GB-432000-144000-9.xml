		<content>{Fashions}today can range from very    
 baggy trousers to very tight trousers 
 that people can hardly walk in, or    
 very short skirts to very long skirts.
 Fashions are changing all the time for
 instance in the old days people used  
 to wear very pointed black boots then 
 people stopped wearing them and they  
 went out of fashion, now they are back
 again. The clothes we wear are now    
 bought in shops or made by hand with  
 aid of a pattern. People will wear all
 sorts of things, different colours,   
 sizes and lengths.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
