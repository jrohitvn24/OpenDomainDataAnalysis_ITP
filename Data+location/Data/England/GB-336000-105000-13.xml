		<content> The house I like best in the village  
 is callled Lullingstone.It is an old  
 thatched cotttage that has been       
 modernised.It is a quarter of the way 
 up Fore St.The village has a          
 Church.Parts of it were built in the  
 13th century.The vilage also has a    
 Jubilee Hall,and a pub.It  used to    
 have 3 pubs but 2 closed down.There a 
 some old cottages along Western       
 Way.Most of the houses in Church St   
 are old.Next to the Church is the     
 Vicarage.Now a familiy live           
 there,instead of the vicar.The people 
 who live there are making it          
 modern.There are new houses in the    
 village,mostly in Davies Close.They   
 are council houses.There are some new 
 bungalows in Court St.The village is a
 mixture of old and new houses.
