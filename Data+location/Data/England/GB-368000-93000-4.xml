		<title>04E. CHARMINSTER - FARMING 1</title>
		<content>  The land is predominantly chalk, and 
 the sheep farming of the lusher river 
 valley meadows has given way to arable
 farming.                              
  Wheat, durum wheat and barley are the
 main crops, interspersed with fields  
 for hay and silage. There is an       
 occasional field of oil seed rape and 
 sugar beet, but they don't appear to  
 thrive in this area.                  
  There is a large grain dryer just    
 past Wolfeton Eweleaze, and this      
 services many farms over a large area.
  One or two farms have a small dairy  
 herd, usually Friesians, and one herd 
 of Aberdeen Angus is the only evidence
 of beef production.                   
  An interesting{sideline}on one farm  
 is an apiary, with Dorset honey being 
 produced and sold by the family.
