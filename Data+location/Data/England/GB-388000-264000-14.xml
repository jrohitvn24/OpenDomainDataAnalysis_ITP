		<title>14FARMING - dairy</title>
		<content> The main farming activities in a      
 mostly rural block is{dairy farming   
 and beef cattle.  There is a wide     
 variety of farm sizes although the    
 area is dominated by a collection of  
 five original farms now owned by a    
 Life Assurance Society with a Farm    
 manager in charge.  This 'collection' 
 totals some 1133 acres and is almost  
 entirely devoted to dairy cattle with 
 some animals culled for beef.  The    
 main dairy breeds here are            
 Friesian and Holstein.  Milk produced 
 is sent to the Birmingham Dairies.    
 The pattern remains the same on even  
 the smallest dairy farm with the same 
 breed of cattle being used.  The      
 average gallon production per cow is  
 significantly higher on the bigger    
 farm and the time taken on milking per
 cow is less.                          
                                       </content>
