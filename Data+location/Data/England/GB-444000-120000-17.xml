		<content> In the science department             
 They're planting seeds in pots        
 We're not sure what kind they are     
 It said 'Triffids' on the box.        
 We've seen the sights of Normandy     
 We've been to Gay Paris               
 Our French is really quite superb     
 Now we can cope with the E.E.C.       
 From work and concentration           
 We need to have a break               
 That's when the pigs amongst us       
 Have a double ice cream flake.        
 We all think Humanities               
 Is lots of fun you,see                
 We've all learnt better handwriting   
 It's called calligraphy.              
 We really want to thank you folks     
 For giving us this school.            
 To show appreciation                  
 We will use it to the full.
