		<title>11Arlington Reservoir: supply</title>
		<content>   The Reservoir was opened in 1971.   
   Approximate volume when full is 750 
 million gallons. Water is extracted   
 from the Cuckmere River.              
   Following storage in the Reservoir, 
 water is treated in Arlington         
 Treatment Works, approximately        
 5 million gallons per day.            
   Treatment at the works is fairly    
 sophisticated. It includes removal of 
 solids, filtration and sterilisation  
 using chlorine. Regular sampling is   
 carried out to check that the water is
 of adequate quality.                  
   The water is then pumped to         
 Folkington treated water reservoir at 
 night. During the day it gravitates to
 its distribution system to supply     
 parts of Eastbourne, Heathfield,      
 the whole of Hailsham, and sometimes  
 Bexhill.
