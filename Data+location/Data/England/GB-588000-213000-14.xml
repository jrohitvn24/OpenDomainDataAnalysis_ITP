 The Tiptree Book Service is near to   
 St. Lukes School. My dad, who works   
 there said:- He had worked there 16   
 years. He enjoys his job and starts at
 8.00a.m. and finishes at 5.00p.m. "Do 
 you think you'd get another job?" If  
 I am made redundant. Then we went to  
 see Tom Calaby. We asked him questions
 about his job. The first questions we 
 asked were:- What is your job? He     
 replied I am a book binder. Do you    
 work with machines? He answered yep.  
 He works at Hutchinsons of Tiptree. We
 asked if more men worked there than   
 women? Rather puzzled he replied no.  
 Do you think there will be changes?   
 Already we've had a change-a new      
 manager. He is American.
