		<title>07ASH DISPOSAL WORKS</title>
		<content> The Ash Disposal Works is situated two
 Kilometres East of Cridling Stubbs,   
 which is on the Western side of the   
 area                                  
 The Ash Disposal Works Site has been  
 open for Fifteen years,and in that    
 time there has been about 16.5 million
 Cubic Metres of waste been dumped.    
 There are no chemicals being dumped on
 the site, just ash and other waste    
 from the Power Station at Eggborough. 
 The lorries do not have far to travel,
 the power station is only a few miles 
 away. The reason why the site was     
 chosen at Cridling Stubbs is because  
 of the easy access to the Motorway    
 and other roads. The ash which is     
 loaded on to the lorries is taken to  
 builders all over Yorkshire and is    
 used for crusher run on the roads and 
 Motorways.
