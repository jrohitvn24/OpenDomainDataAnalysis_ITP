		<title>03Fishing in Flookburgh</title>
		<content>    Fishing at{Flookburgh}is unique.   
  Fishing is carried out on{Morecambe  
{Bay}using a tractor and trailer..fifty
 years ago they used horses and carts  
 and many people were involved.Now only
 twelve families work in this way.     
   Teena often goes with her Dad and   
 Grandad on fishing trips, leaving in  
 the early morning, before school.     
   They go down to their shed, Teena   
 checks the fuel,while Dad sorts out   
 the trailer with its nets and gear.   
 Then they drive out of the village on 
 to the marshes that lead to the vast  
 expanse of Morecambe Bay.They discard 
 the waste of yesterdays catch which   
 soon attract scavenging waders and    
 gulls.                                
   From here they drive onto the sands 
 and mudflats.Great care must be taken 
 as the{gullies,channels}and{quicksands
 have claimed tractors and fishermen.  </content>
