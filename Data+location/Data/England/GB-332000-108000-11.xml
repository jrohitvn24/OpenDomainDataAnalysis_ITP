		<title>11STORIES AND TALES IN CHARD</title>
		<content> Chard is a small town with many       
 strange secrets.The one which puzzles 
 most people is how one summer ten     
 children were killed in a strange way.
 The undertaker was so upset that he   
 killed himself rather than face       
 another body.Once he had done this the
 deaths stopped.                       
    Another story is about Chard caves.
 The caves have been filled in but the 
 tunnels are still there.One of the    
 tunnels runs under the Choughs Hotel. 
 These tunnels are to be explored in   
 September 1985.The start of the       
 tunnels is said to be a secret        
 place.People who worship the devil are
 said to hold rituals here.
