		<content> The parish church of St Marys is a    
 large and fine building, it is much   
 larger than any other neighbouring    
 village church. It contains all       
 varieties of 'English Gothic          
 Architecture'. In 1863 it was         
 restored. A new porch was added and   
 the north aisle rebuilt. If you look  
 at the spire from different places you
 can see that it is out of             
 perpendicular.                        
 On the south wall of the chapel, a    
 piscina, and a pew of eight seats,    
 these were probably placed there by   
 Chertsey Abbey.                       
 In the church are some Norman         
 features, especially an enriched south
 door, the chapel arch and a small     
 window in the chapel. Recently        
 discovered on the wall representing   
 the crucifixion and the last          
 Judgement, was a carving in wood      </content>
