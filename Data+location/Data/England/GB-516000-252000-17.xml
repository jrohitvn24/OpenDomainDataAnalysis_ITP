		<title>17Housing in Tempsford.</title>
		<content> Since the population of Tempsford has 
 remained static since after the second
 world war there has been a marked     
 decrease in the number of new homes   
 being built.Any new homes can only be 
 built on an infilling basis that is   
 they take up a space already occupied 
 by a building and build on to it or   
 round it.                             
 Homes in Tempsford fall into 1 of 3   
 groups.                               
 1.The older nut thatched cottages with
 17th and 18thC timbers inside,small   
 windows and doors.                    
 2.Modern bungalows built 1960s with   
 dormer windows in the roof and weather
 boarding on the outer walls.          
 3.Semi-detatched or terraced brick    
 built houses constructed late 1930s   
 very plain looking and certainly      
 detracts from any picture postcard    
 image of an old English village.      </content>
