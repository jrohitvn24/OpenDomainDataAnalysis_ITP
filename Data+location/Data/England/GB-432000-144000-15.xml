		<title>15STAMP COLLECTING</title>
		<content> I collect stamps.  Stamps are pieces  
 of paper with perforated edges.       
 They are used as fee's for sending    
 letters.  Some ofthe first stamps are 
 worth a lot of money nowadays.  New   
 stamps are issued every 2 months.  The
 penny black was the first stamp to be 
 issued and now is worth over Â£l5000.  
 We stick stamps on envelopes to show  
 whether they go first class (which    
 means it will go faster through the   
 post).  Or second class which is      
 slower.  In my collection I think I've
 got about l000 stamps.  One of the    
 stamps I've got is worth a hundred    
 pounds.
