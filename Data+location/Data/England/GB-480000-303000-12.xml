		<content> Launde Park Wood (803038) is 140 acres
 of ancient woodland stretching from a 
 ridge at 600ft above sea level down to
 the valley of the River Chater. The   
 wood is owned by the Diocese of       
 Leicester and managed by the Forestry 
 Commission.Before 1959 the wood was   
 coppiced ash, elm and oak with a rich 
 and varied coppiced shrub layer       
 containing much hazel. In 1959 the    
 Forestry Commission began felling and 
 replanting the southern part of the   
 wood with oak, beech and western red  
 cedar to the detriment of its         
 ecological interest.The northern part 
 was unaffected and still supports     
 bluebells and wild garlic as well as  
 rarer plants such as toothwort. The   
 tracks in the southern part were      
 resurfaced with crushed limestone     
 so introducing alien flora such as    
 wild parsnip and centaury.            </content>
