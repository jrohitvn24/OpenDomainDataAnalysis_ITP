		<content>  Harpsichord Camerata is an instru_   
 mental ensemble specialising in the   
 performance of Baroque music and has  
 the 18th century ensemble tradition of
 Flute, Oboe, Violin, Violoncello and  
 Harpsichord with occasional Bassoon.  
  The group is Welwyn based and was    
 founded in 1973 by Robert Gould who   
 has been its director ever since.     
 Harpsichord Camerata give approx 12   
 concerts each year to the benefit of a
 number of charities. Concerts are     
 generally but not exclusively given in
 and around Hertfordshire.             
  6 years ago a Welwyn based chamber   
 orchestra was formed in which all the 
 players from Harpsichord Camerata are 
 joined by another 10 instrumentalists.
 It has the name of the Camerata       
 Orchestra and has become well known in
 Herts for performances of music from  
 late 16th to 20th century.            </content>
