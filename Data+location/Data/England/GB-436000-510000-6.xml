		<title>06PUMPING STATIONS</title>
		<content> In 1948 Low Worsall 1 was built to    
 supply the needs of the ICI chemical  
 and British Steel industries. Industry
 on Teesside developed greatly. They   
 thought that they should build another
 pumping station as they needed more   
 water. Low Worsall 2 was finished in  
 1981  being 60 feet deep,the pipes are
 48 inches in depth and it only needs  
 one man to pop in for ten minutes     
 daily. The machinery is run           
 automatically with a radio link to    
 Thornaby office. When Low Worsall was 
 built they found the remains of the   
 old port. They built the station very 
 deep so that they could keep going    
 even when the river was at low tide.  
 The old station can be used if        
 necessary.Twenty three million gallons
 a day of non potable water is pumped  
 from Low Worsall 2 to the industries  
 on Teesside.                          </content>
