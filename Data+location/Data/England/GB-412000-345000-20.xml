We do Mathematics each day. The sums   
we do are addition,subtraction,        
multiplication and division and plenty 
of topic maths as well.                
Our school has a football team.The team
colours are blue and red.We play with 7
players and two reserves.              
On Monday afternoons the girls have    
gymnastics.There are four Awards in the
British Amateur Gymnastics Association 
scheme. There are ten tests in each    
Award.                                 
We write a diary about the things that 
happen to us at the weekend,where we go
and things like that.In English we read
stories and answer questions.          
Sometimes we paint pictures and make   
models.
