		<title>08Farming A Dairy Farm</title>
		<content>    On Tuesday, 2lst May, l985 we went 
 to a dairy farm to interview the      
 farmer.  He was a very nice man.      
    We sat on some straw bails and then
 we went to see some friesian calves.  
 They were very pretty and black and   
 white in colour.  The farmer had l44  
 cows.  He chose friesians because they
 gave the most milk.  He showed us the 
 milking shed and we watched the cows  
 being milked.                         
    The farmer also owned a young      
 Hereford bull which was not very big  
 but was very bossy. It had a ring in  
 its nose.  The bull went in with the  
 other cows and just stood and waited  
 until the cows were milked.           
    At another farm Michael saw a calf 
 that had been born less than 24 hours 
 before.  She was called Sarah.
