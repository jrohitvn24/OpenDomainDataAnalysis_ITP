		<title>11THE OLD BREWERY,FENSTANTON</title>
		<content>{    The Brewery}is an old house in    
{High Street.}It was built in{1850, }  
 but before that they used to brew at  
 Hall Green Farm, but only for 2 years.
    {The water supply}came from 2      
 wells,one behind the Brewery,         
 25 metres deep,the other in Swan Lane.
    {John Coote}first had the Brewery  
 and then sold it to{Robert Odhams.    
 In{1860}his son took over and later   
 sold the building to{R.W.Flick.}In    
 1887,he sold it to{H.J.Burt.}         
{  } There was a big fire in{1901}so   
 they stopped producing beer.Then the  
 Brewery was used as a bottling depot. 
     In{1906}it was sold and converted 
 into a house.                         
     In{1899}1 gallon of the best beer 
 was sold at 1/6d which is about       
 10pence in our money.Today a pint cost
 at least 70p.
