		<content>  Much of the area consists of farmland
 with a narrow residential section     
 running between the MOSS to the South 
 East and SANDHILLS to the North West. 
  The residential area lies between the
 villages of BIRKDALE and AINSDALE and 
 forms part of a large DORMITORY SUBURB
 with many of the inhabitants          
 commuting to LIVERPOOL  each day. Much
 of the older housing forms part of a  
 RIBBON DEVELOPMENT alongside the main 
 road between LIVERPOOL and SOUTHPORT. 
 Estates of council housing were later 
 built between the main road and the   
 MOSS.                                 
  The MOSS is INTENSIVELY farmed with  
 ARABLE CROPS being grown and DAIRY    
 HERDS kept.                           
  The highest point in an otherwise    
 flat landscape is a SANDHILL 15m above
 SEA LEVEL.
