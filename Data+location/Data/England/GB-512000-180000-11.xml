		<title>11THE CEMETERY IN GREENFORD</title>
		<content>                                       
   We went to the Greenford Cemetery.  
 There were many tombs which were about
 6-10 feet deep. There are two people  
 buried in each plot. As I walked      
 behind the rest I noticed a tomb stone
 for a baby which had died three days  
 old without a name. As I walked round 
 the corner there were a lot of        
 bouquets saying,'Nan and Mum,' in     
 forget-me-nots.                       
   We went past the Moslem plot. Last  
 time I went there some people were    
 praying and had red smoke going up    
 into the air. When people are buried, 
 their heads point towards Mecca.      
   There were two men rolling a grave  
 stone. I think they were going to put 
 another body in the grave. They were  
 using a steel pole to shift the stone.
