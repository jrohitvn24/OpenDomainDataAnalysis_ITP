		<content>      No form of{public transport}now  
 serves this area.   The{railway,}the  
 Station for which is one mile outside 
 Stogumber, was{closed in 1972}under   
 the Beeching Plan.   However it       
 reopened under{private ownership}a    
 couple of years later.   This is run  
 for{tourists}with steam trains.       
      A{mini bus}owned by Bryants      
 Coaches in Williton takes passengers  
{twice weekly to Taunton}from          
 Stogumber.                            
      Most{families own a car}and this 
 is certainly an essential part of life
 in this area.   Regular{weekly trips }
 are made by the{farmers to market}for 
 buying and selling stock.  {Mothers  }
 need to travel to the town for        
{shopping.}  The nearest{surgery}is    
{four miles}from the village.   Many   
 people{work}outside the area and      
{commute daily.    }                   </content>
