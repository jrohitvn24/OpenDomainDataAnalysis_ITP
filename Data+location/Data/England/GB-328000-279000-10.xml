		<title>10Historic Buildings of Clun</title>
		<content> The remains of Clun Castle consist of 
 the keep, part of two round towers and
 a small portion of wall. The keep is  
 unusual in that it is built on the    
 side of the motte. Clun Castle has two
 baileys. One is now a bowling green.  
 The Town Hall stands in the square.   
 Above the door is the coat of arms of 
 Lord Clive. The top storey of the town
 hall is now the parish council chamber
 and the bottom storey is Clun Museum. 
 The vicarage was built in about 1700. 
 There is one wood panelled room and an
 attractive staircase. The garden      
 contains large herbaceous borders.    
 In the Parish Church, the pyx canopy  
 above the altar, and north aisle roof 
 (with angels on either side), are     
 medieval.There is a Jacobean pulpit   
 and panelling in the Lady Chapel . A  
 brass memorial to Sir Robert Howard is
 also in the Lady Chapel.              </content>
