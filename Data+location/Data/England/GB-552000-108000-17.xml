		<title>17The Village Hall.</title>
		<content>  One of the most imprtant buldings in 
 the village of Upper Dicker is the    
 Village Hall for it is used as        
 ameeting place by various groups and  
 many functions are held there.        
   The Drama Group, which consists     
 mainly of villagers, is responsible   
 for producing a play in the summer, a 
 cabaret in the autumn and a pantomime 
 at Christmas. Several discos are held 
 during the year, organised either by  
 the villagers or by the local schools 
 for there is very little entertainment
 for schoolchildren and teenagers      
 within the area.                      
   Bonfire Night and Christmas parties 
 are also held, as well as Keep Fit    
 classes, Parish Council meetings,     
 jumble sales, an annual auction and a 
 local quiz called the Egg-head        
 Competition. The adjoining field is   
 used for football matches and Carnival</content>
