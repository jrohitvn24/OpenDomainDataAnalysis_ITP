		<title>17LANDSCAPE AROUND EDGEFIELD</title>
		<content> The land around Edgefield is gently   
 undulating, with several small copses.
 Fields for grazing and crops are      
 varied in size, none so big as to     
 create a prairie effect. There is good
 mixed hedging with mature trees,      
 primarily oak and ash, and some new   
 planting. Two areas of woodland are   
 coniferous with borders of deciduous  
 trees. Little Wood has been designated
 a site of special scientific interest 
 because of its sessile oaks, rare in  
 this part of the country and          
 particularly good for charcoal. A     
 fourth wood is an attractive walking  
 area with hidden ponds. Three streams,
 tributaries of the rivers Bure and    
 Glaven, wind through the area. Wild   
 plants and flowers can be found in the
 hedgerows and woodlands which provide 
 a good habitat for small animals and  
 birds.                                </content>
