		<content>{Casual clothes} are worn when we want 
to feel comfortable and relax. They    
are easy to wear and easy to take care 
of. We like to feel they make us more  
attractive. The most popular colours at
the moment are pale pastel, and        
different items are chosen to match    
each other.                            
{Sports clothes} are designed to be    
hard wearing, light and easy to move   
in. Some specialised sports clothing is
tough and gives added protection.      
Shorts and shirt are common for outdoor
sports, a leotard may be worn indoors  
by girls. Cricketers wear special pads 
to protect their legs, and hats to     
protect their heads. Shoes are very    
important too. Footballers have strong 
light shoes with studs in the soles,   
runners have spiked shoes to give added
grip, netballers wear strong, light    
flat soled shoes.                      </content>
