		<content> Unemployment in the area is below the 
 current average. A relatively large   
 proportion of locally resident workers
 travel outside the area to the nearby 
{Matthews Turkey}processing plant or   
 one of the two major building firms,  
{Denny &amp; Duncan &amp; Son}who serve a      
 large part of the surrounding area.   
 There is little new building in       
 Southwold itself. A smaller proportion
 travel into the area to work.         
  The{Southwold Hospital}provides      
 additional jobs of both professional  
 and ancilliary nature.                
  The fishing industry continues to    
 decline but a number of older local   
 residents are still engaged in small  
 boat activities.An unusual component  
 of the holiday trade is to be found in
 the large number of continental       
 vistors who arrive in their own boats.
