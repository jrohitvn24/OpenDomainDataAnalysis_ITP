		<title>17THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY</title>
		<content>Approximatly 12% of Castle School      
pupils are of the Muslim faith and,    
therefore,should have thier community  
represented in the Domesday Project.   
This Muslim Community is composed of   
two sets,Tabliq Muslims and Sunnie     
Muslims.Both sets have their own place 
of worship in Lancaster and each is    
close to were they live.The Sunnies    
use the Mosque in Blade Street and the 
Tabliqs use the one at the bottom of   
Albion street.Both Mosques are made    
from houses.In Castle School itself    
there are 16 Sunnie and 15 Tabliq      
children.The Muslim Community came to  
Britain from India because they thought
that they would have a better standard 
of living and better prospects for them
and their children than if they stayed 
at home.Some came on marriage grounds. 
Some came to join their families who   
had already come to Britain.           </content>
