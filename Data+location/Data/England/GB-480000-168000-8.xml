		<title>08WOKINGHAM _ TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> The{bus service}was started by the    
 Thames Valley Traction Co. Ltd.       
 between l920 and l925.  Long before   
 this the{railway}had come to Wokingham
 when the Wokingham to Guildford line  
 was opened in l849.                   
 The{roads}in the area offer access to 
 London and Wales via the M4.  The     
 A329(M) connecting Wokingham to the M4
 was finished in l973. {Congestion}in  
 the town and at junctions outside is  
 caused by excessive{traffic}to and    
 from Reading, Bracknell and London at 
 rush hour times. {Parking}is also a   
 problem as two supermarkets in the    
 town have a large area of influence.  
{Trains}run to Waterloo every half an  
 hour with extra services added for the
 rush hours.{ Buses}still operate      
 locally and coaches run over longer   
 distances, but the{car}is definitely  
 the prime mode of transport.          </content>
