		<title>20Our Pets</title>
		<content>{My name is Dawn.}I have two pets, a   
 canary and a rabbit.The rabbit often  
 escapes and we have to ambush him.We  
 jump out on him and put him back in   
 his cage.When mummy was hoovering the 
 bottom of the canary cage one day the 
 canary suddenly got sucked into the   
 hoover tube.Only his head was sticking
 out but he was not hurt at all.       
{My name is David.}My pet is an Old    
 English Sheepdog. Her name is Sheba.  
 When she is eating her dinner she     
 always gets her biscuits on the floor 
 with her dinner and her water on the  
 floor too.Sometimes I take Sheba out  
 for a play. When she isn't looking I  
 run away and she looks for me.When she
 finds me I stop and Sheba rolls on the
 ground. She likes that game.
