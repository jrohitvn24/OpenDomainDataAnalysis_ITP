		<content> INTERVIEW with a pupil who works at a 
 riding school.                        
 "I arrive at the farm at 8-30am. At   
 9am we bring the horses from the      
 field. First we give them a feed of   
 oats and bran and then we brush them. 
 At 10am the riding starts. There are  
 three rides, each lasting for one     
 hour. There are 12 horses but at      
 present we only use 6 because the     
 others have not yet been broken in.   
 At 1am we have our dinners and after  
 that we bring in our own horses, brush
 them, and put on their bridles and    
 saddles, which we calll their tack. We
 then go for a ride ourselves.         
 After we have ridden our own horses we
 take their tack off and feed them.    
 Then they are turned back into the    
 field."
