		<title>12HOUSES-ALLSCOTT</title>
		<content>    Some of the houses in and around   
 Allscott date as far back as 1722.    
                                       
    Most of the houses in the area we  
 are studying are of traditional brick 
 constrction,with tile or slate        
 roofing.However,one or two houses     
 within our area have thatched roofs.A 
 thatched roof is a roof made of straw 
 which is tightly packed together. As  
 there is a terrific fire risk with    
 these roofs they are getting scarce.  
 To insure these houses  the people who
 live there need to pay quite high     
 premiums.                             
 There has been developed a new type of
 thatch made from a plastic material, b
 ut again this is very expensive.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
