 and societies, the Women's            
 Institute, Mother's Union, Church     
 Choir, the Amateur Dramatic Club known
 as the Dedham Players who not only    
 perform plays but are also involved   
 with most local events. Dedham Arts   
 Group holds two exhibitions a year at 
 Littlegarth Studio, which belongs to  
 Miss Mallett, the lady who founded the
 Littlegarth Private School in 1940,   
 some of the tourists buy the exhibits 
 in this exhibition.                   
 There is an Antiques Fair held every  
 month in the Hewitt Hall, where the   
 Littlegarth School now meets. The     
 Hewitt Hall is also the library and is
 used for meetings and for plays by the
 Dedham Players. This Hall is shown in 
 some of Constable's paintings and was 
 at one time used for Hunt Balls.
