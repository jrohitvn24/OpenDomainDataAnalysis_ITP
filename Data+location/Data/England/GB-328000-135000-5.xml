 Few people work in Wembdon, most work 
 in Bridgwater or at the nearby Hinkley
 Point nuclear power station. In the   
 village there is a post office with a 
 small general store, a small grocer's 
 shop and an inn. A builder, an antique
 furniture restorer and a car mechanic 
 work in the village. An old people's  
 home has 13 residents and 2 staff.    
 The population of Wembdon is 1750 and 
 there is an infant school and a junior
 school for the children. The infant   
 school has 102 pupils and the junior  
 school 130.                           
 Guides, brownies, scouts, cubs and a  
 junior cycling club cater for the     
 children.                             
 About 250 people worship in the Norman
 village church and many social and    
 fund raising activities are centred   
 around it                             </content>
