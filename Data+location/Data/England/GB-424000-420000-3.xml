		<title>03A DAY IN MY LIFE BY JEAN</title>
		<content> Every Saturday I go into Dewsbury with
 my friend Dawn.We take our money and  
 some times buy earrings and beads.The 
 one thing we always buy is a "WHAM"   
 badge, book and poster."WHAM" is my   
 favourite pop group.When we've spent  
 up we look around the town.My Mum buys
 my clothes.She goes to Dewsbury and   
 buys what I like.I like to wear jeans,
 a sweater and a pair of trainers at   
 the weekend.If it is warm I wear some 
 shorts and a top.After my dinner I    
 slouch down in the chair and watch    
 television.We have two pets in our    
 house; one is a dog and the other is a
 budgie.Before I go out in the  morning
 I do my jobs- make my bed, wash up and
 tidy the breakfast bar, then look     
 after my sister Collette.In my spare  
 time I do some drawing and read Enid  
 Blyton books.On Saturdays we do gym   
 in my back garden.                    </content>
