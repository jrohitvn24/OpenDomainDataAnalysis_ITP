		<title>02Why Live in Whitminster?</title>
		<content> As a part of our survey we asked a    
 number of the local children why they 
 thought Whitminster was a pleasant    
 place to live, or if they didn't like 
 it.These are some of their            
 impressions.                          
                                       
 "Whitminster is a very quiet village  
 and very clean. It is a happy village 
 with friendly people".                
                                       
 "There is a lot of land to play on".  
                                       
 "Whitminster is a very quiet place    
 except when the lorries go by".       
                                       
 "At night it is quite noisy because   
 gangs go around shouting".            
                                       
 "In the Village Hall there are various
 events going on such as cubs and      
 scouts, badminton and a youth club".  </content>
