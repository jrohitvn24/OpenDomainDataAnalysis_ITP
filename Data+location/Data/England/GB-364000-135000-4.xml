		<title>04 A LOCAL FARMING FAMILY</title>
		<content>   Miss Collins,for many years was     
the school secretary at Sexey's in     
Bruton,mentioned in another block,     
but she is also the daughter of a      
farming family of some local standing. 
She was born on a farm near Milton     
Clevedon,called Greenscombe and        
followed the family into farming by    
taking over in 1962.                   
    She likes the farming life,but     
not the mechanical side.When she       
started,there were few chemicals       
involved,unlike today.She farms on     
hilly land,which she uses for sheep.   
She used to keep dairy cattle but now  
the land is all turned over to grass.  
There have been no real farming        
tragedies in her life,except once when 
an old blind horse died in harness,up  
on a hill,known afterwards as          
Breakheart Hill for some time.
