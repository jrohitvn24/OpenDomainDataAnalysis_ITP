		<title>15Sunday in Allenton, Derby</title>
		<content> On Sunday I get up and go for the     
 papers from T.C.News When I get back  
 my breakfast is ready. I usually have 
 bacon and eggs and beans. Then at     
 about half past nine I walk round to  
 Sunday School. We listen to stories,  
 sing songs and do quizzes. I am there 
 until eleven o'clock. Then I run home 
 to get ready to go trampolining. I go 
 to the Shaftesbury Centre in          
 Normanton. At a quarter to twelve I   
 meet my friend at the top of the      
 street. When I come back my Sunday    
 dinner is ready. We usually eat roast 
 beef with vegetables and afterwards we
 have apple pie and custard. Then I    
 play outside in the garden.If it's    
 raining I play in my bedroom with my  
 Barbie and Sindy dolls. At night we   
 usually watch a video then have a bath
 and go to bed.
