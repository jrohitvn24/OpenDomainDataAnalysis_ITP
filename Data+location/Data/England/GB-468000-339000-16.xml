		<title>16LIFE IN BINGHAM (1)</title>
		<content>    On this page and the few following 
 are comments from children between the
 ages of 6 and 13. Each comment is to  
 do with what they think of living in  
 Bingham.                              
    "I like Bingham because it is a    
 quiet and peaceful village."          
    "I like Bingham because it is not  
 too small to be a village and not too 
 big to be a town."                    
    "I like to take walks when it's    
 raining because I like being beneath  
 an umbrella and there is nobody       
 around."                              
    "I like Bingham because of the     
 Sports Centre and for the swimming    
 baths."                               
    "One of the things I like about    
 Bingham is that it has almost         
 everything in one place."             
    "It's near the countryside."
