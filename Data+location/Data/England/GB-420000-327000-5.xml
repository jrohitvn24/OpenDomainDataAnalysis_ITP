		<content>In the midst of the village stands the 
Â£Spread EagleÂ£.It used to be a resting 
place for horses and their riders but  
now it is a pub,restaurant and hotel   
with thirteen rooms.It has a well-     
stocked garden with a large lawned area
which is mainly used in summer time.   
Alongside the Â£Spread' runs the        
Alderbrook and many people,whilst      
enjoying a drink,will sit ,on the wall 
admiring the brook.
