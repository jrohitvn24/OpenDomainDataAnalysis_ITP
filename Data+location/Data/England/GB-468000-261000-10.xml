 This is at the Community Centre.      
It was finished  in 1972 at a cost of  
90,000 pounds, the money being provided
by the Nene Foundation.                
The pool is 25 metres by 10 metres,    
graduating from 1 metre to 3 metres in 
depth. It holds 100,000 gallons of     
water and is rarely completely emptied.
The water is pemanently filtered and   
is heated to 78 degrees F.  Every two  
months the pool is given a backwash'  
with some water taken out whilst fresh 
is added.                              
                                       
The pool, used by schools and clubs, is
open until 10.00 p.m.  It is open to   
the general public during school       
holiday.
