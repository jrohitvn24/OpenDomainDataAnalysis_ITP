		<title>14Moving into Much Marcle</title>
		<content> Before I moved to Much Marcle I lived 
 in New Ash Green which was about the  
 same size as the town of Ledbury.It   
 was quite big with approximately      
 thirty shops.At New Ash Green we had a
 house with three bedrooms, kitchen,   
 bathroom, lounge, diningroom and small
 garden.We moved to Much Marcle to have
 more land,to keep the ponies and      
 because my grandfather lives in       
 Cheltenham.The house we live in ,at   
 Much Marcle is in a mess ,but we are  
 slowly improving it.we have almost    
 finished upstairs,and now we are      
 improving the landing. I like  Much   
 Marcle  much better than New Ash      
 Green.There is so much to look out    
 for,I see rabbits running across the  
 road,birds in the trees,different     
 crops in the fields.I like being in a 
 small school because we get much more 
 work done.                            </content>
