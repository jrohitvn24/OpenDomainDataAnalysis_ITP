		<content> Each police force in England and Wales
 has a number of divisions,which are   
 based on large areas of land or       
 population.These divisions,with a     
 Chief Superintendent in charge,usually
 control a number of sub-divisions,each
 under the command of a superintendent 
 or a chief Inspector.A sub division is
 responsible for the day to day        
 policing of a small area.It will have 
 Inspectors,Sergeants,and Constables.  
 Most will also CID(detectives),traffic
 wardens,typists and other people to   
 support the officer on patrol.If you  
 were unhealthy before becoming a      
 policeman or woman you would have to  
 start a new life by joining a club to 
 make you healthy this helps you alot.
