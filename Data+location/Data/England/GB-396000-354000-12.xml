		<title>12CLUB DAY IN LEEK</title>
		<content>Club Day is a time when all the Sunday 
Schools,Cubs,Scouts Guides and Brownies
gather together and walk around the    
town.It happens usually in the middle  
of July. The Clubs start off at the    
Maude Institute and start to walk to   
the Market Place.There is open air hymn
singing  and prayers are read out.They 
walk all around the town.              
Afterwards , there is a party and a few
sport races .                          
I have been in Club Day and I liked it.
It makes your legs tired though,but the
party is good.                         
Club Day is nearly a 100 years         
old.Around 1810 it was known as Cap    
Sunday,because of the white caps worn  
by the girls,but later it was changed  
to Saturday.
