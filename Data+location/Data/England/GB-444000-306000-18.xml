		<content> The plant nursery has been in Thornton
 for 21 years.Mr.Smith the owner is a  
 fuchsia expert growing 210 different  
 types.In all,the nursery stocks       
 approximately 200,000 plants,and 600

 B.B.C.T.V."Gardeners World"and various

 kept at a temperature of 55 degrees   
 f.during the day and 45 degrees at

 the green house to kill the insects.

 The nursery employs 3 people full     
 time and 3 part time.Approximately    
 500 people visit the nursery each     
 week.We think it is a lovely  place   
 to visit particulary with the         
 reservoir across the road..           </content>
