		<content> Usually after school I change into my 
 play clothes,then call for my friend. 
 Much of the time we go on our roller  
 boots.We enjoy this because the road  
 has just been made smooth.Other times 
 we go for a ride on our bikes or a    
 short walk.                           
 One of my hobbies is reading.Every    
 week I go to the library to fetch four
 new books.My best author is Enid      
 Blyton.Her best series is Mallory     
 Towers about a girl who goes to a     
 boarding school.                      
 When I am by myself I like to play    
 with my pets.I have one hamster and   
 three goldfish.Most evenings I watch 2
 hours of television.At 21.00 I have a 
 wash and get ready for bed.Mum comes  
 up and says"Good-night" and I read for
 half  an hour.Then I sleep.
