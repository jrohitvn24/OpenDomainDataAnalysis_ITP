		<title>07Warsop's Oil Depot.</title>
		<content>  A new skyline was given to Warsop    
 when the B.P.Oil Depot was built about
 20 years ago.Three huge oil tanks     
 tower over the outskirts of the town. 
 They were built in the disused goods  
 yard at the once busy railway station.
                                       
 The tanks altogether hold about       
 1,651,000 litres of refined oil.Just  
 one train brings 750,000 litres from  
 the refinery.                         
                                       
  The oil is delivered by road to      
 farms,industry,haulage businesses and 
 private houses.                       
                                       
  In the summer about 250 tonnes of oil
 are delivered whereas in winter this  
 quantity is doubled.
