		<title>19Health in Norden</title>
		<content> The nearest doctor's surgery to Norden
 is about a mile away. There are four  
 doctors there who will go out on house
 calls within the area. They hold a    
 clinic for pregnant women but have no 
 special clinic for old people. The    
 opening hours for the surgery are half
 past nine until quarter past ten in   
 the morning and from three until five 
 in the afternoon.                     
    In Shawfield School we all have a  
 hygene test each term. The nurse comes
 in and looks at hair, nails etc.      
 Everyone has a tuberculosis injection 
 at the age of 10 or 11. Girls also    
 have a rubella injection at the age of
 11 or 12. A dentist comes in and looks
 at our teeth.
