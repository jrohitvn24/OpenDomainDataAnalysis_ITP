 mainly residential,the main feature   
 are the many small roads leading to   
 the houses. The main roads through the
 area are Warstock Road and School     
 Road. Lorries going to the factory    
 estate on Warstock Road use the main  
 Alcester Road South from the city     
 centre.                               
                                       
     RAIL: The railway line in the     
 area is between Yardley Wood Station  
 and Shirley Station. This is part of  
 the main line from Birmingham Moor    
 Street to Stratford-Upon-Avon.        
                                       
     CANAL: The Stratford-Upon-Avon    
 canal is used for leisure             
 activities,for example,barge trips,   
 fishing and canoeing. The canal       
 triangle Stratford-Severn-Avon is now
