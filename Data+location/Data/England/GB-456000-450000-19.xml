 There was an annual fair on the site  
 of St.Barnabas' School until 1885,when
 Clifton Green Preservation Society    
 stopped the fair and the bonfire on   
 the green,but they erect a Christmas  
 tree with coloured lights each        
 year.Carlysle Street had a bonfire    
 until they made a park;now,on November
 5th there's a bonfire on the playing  
 fields instead.St.Peter's School has a
 bonfire,but they don't burn a "Guy    
 Fawkes" because he was an old pupil!  
  On St.Barnabas' Day,June 11th,we sing
 and entertain the old people.We have a
 May Parade around the local streets.At
 Christmas we perform a musical play   
 and at Easter the Easter Bunny leaves 
 footprints and eggs in school.We have 
 a Sports Day at the end of the summer 
 term.
