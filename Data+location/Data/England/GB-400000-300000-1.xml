		<content> The memories of Mrs. Meeke reflect    
 Rushall's village_like past existence.
 Youngsters give a secure but detached 
 view of 'grown_ups'. These reflections
 contrast strikingly with tatting and  
 social concerns. The metal church in  
 Rushall and the poorly drained and    
 mineral worked swathe of green are    
 testimony to rapid housing development
 over the last hundred years. The      
 existence of community schools and    
 neighbourhood offices is noteable in  
 the area. Contributions from the west 
 of the area around Harden and         
 Blakenhall concentrate on attitudes to
 leisure, employment, population,      
 communications and housing. The east  
 of the area concentrated on ecology,  
 health, life-styles and general       
 historical element.
