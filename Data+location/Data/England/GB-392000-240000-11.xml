		<content> We examined the school log between the
 years 1935-1985. Between the years    
 1935-1940 we noticed that they had    
 days off for Royal occasions . In the 
 early Forties, children were fitted   
 with gas masks because of the outbreak
 of war. Evacuees were brought from    
 Birmingham and were taught with local 
 children. The Wings for Victory week  
 raised Â£200 to buy parts for          
 aeroplanes. In 1945 there were V.E.   
 day celebrations. Between 1950 and    
 1959, students came from Worcester    
 College. Children began to go on      
 school trips. There were open days for
 parents. In the Sixties, swimming     
 lessons started at Tewkwsbury pool,   
 cycling proficiency tests were given  
 and school sports were held every     
 year. In the Seventies there were 143 
 on the school roll. In the Eighties   
 the school got its first computer.    </content>
