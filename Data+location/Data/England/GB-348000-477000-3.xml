		<title>03Beetham Church St.Lioba</title>
		<content>    There was a church on this site in 
 Saxon Times.It was dedicated to a     
 little known Saxon saint,St.Lioba.    
  She was born in Wessex in 710 A.D.   
 and was a cousin of St.Boniface.      
  After a convent education she        
 accompanied Boniface on many of his   
 journeys.                             
  She died in 780 A.D. and was buried  
 next to Boniface in Fulda Cathedral in
 West Germany.                         
  It is supposed that the marks on the 
 top of the pillar in the nave may     
 indicate where a chapel dedicated to  
 her once stood.                       
  In 1982 a statue was erected in a    
 cell a little way up the hill, towards
 Slackhead, of St.Lioba holding a bell.
