		<title>16RATBY FAIR.</title>
		<content>    The Fair comes to Ratby once a year
 and is held on land near the Plough   
 Inn.There are five rides (so it's not 
 a big fair),they are the Cyclone,the  
 Chaser,the Waltzer,the Little Trains  
 and the Roundabout.All the rides cost 
 25p.There is also an arcade and some  
 'One Armed Bandits'.Of course there   
 are some other games to play for      
 prizes like the Shooting Gallery,     
 Hook-a-Duck and the Ball in the       
 Bucket.                               
    People enjoy going to the fair to  
 meet friends,to go on the rides and to
 try the food.The atmosphere and noise 
 are terrific and the latter can be    
 heard from the other end of the       
 village.The best time to go is at     
 night because the lights and activity 
 magically transform the fair and the  
 rides become even more thrilling.The  
 candy-floss is good too.              </content>
