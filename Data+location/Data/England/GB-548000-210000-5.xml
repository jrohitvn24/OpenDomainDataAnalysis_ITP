		<title>05Questionaire   Churchgate St</title>
		<content> We had more replies to our{question-  
{aire}from retired people{(OAP's)}than 
 from people who are working. As we    
 collected the questionaires during the
 day, only the retired people were at  
 home. So we can't give information    
 about working people.                 
                                       
 18 OAP's replied. 5 had been resident 
 in the village for more than 50 years,
{4 between 30 and 50 years,}2 between  
 10 and 29 years and{7 for less than 10
{years.}                               
                                       
 Of those who had been resident for    
 more than 30 years 8 had some or most 
 of their relatives living within 5    
 miles.                                
                                       
 11 Of the OAP's depended on the local 
 bus service                           
                                       </content>
