		<title>10RANSKILL SCOUTS &amp; CUBS</title>
		<content> Our local cubs are the 2nd.Ranskill   
 Cubs who meet at the Church Hall every
 Thursday at 6.30pm-8.00pm, the leaders
 include my mum(Mrs.Margaret Parnell), 
 Mrs.skelton and Mrs.Rynberk.I was once
 a cub, but i'm too old now(i'm 11),i'm
 a scout now at 1st. Sutton-Cum-Lound, 
 (there are no Scouts at Ranskill at   
 the moment because know one wants to  
 run it.Though there is some interest  
 now someone may run the Scouts.)The   
 cubs go camping once or twice a year, 
 they go camping at Sheffield(Greno    
 Woods),where Scout leaders Dave &amp;     
 Barry keep them in order!This year for
 the first time the cubs are going on  
 a circus fun camp at Walesby.With lots
 of cups,trophies and events to keep   
 them out of mischief!(They're quite   
 good really.)We win quite alot of     
 cups,trophies and events.
