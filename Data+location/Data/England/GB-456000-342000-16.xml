		<content> Sharon Gibson started javelin throwing
 at the age of 13 at her secondary     
 school.She did other sports as well,  
 such as netball,hockey,rounders and   
 tennis.Her best two sports were       
 netball and javelin.As she grew she   
 started to do the javelin full time,  
 so she decided to drop netball because
 she had to pay for equipment,but you  
 didn't if you did javelin.Sharon      
 started to become famous.She worked 6 
 houts a day and 6 days a week.She is  
 23 and says she will probably stop at 
 30.She has a coach called John Morgan.
 Sharon said her javelin cost 180      
 pounds.Her longest throw in the       
 Olympics was 61.44m.She hopes to break
 the world record someday.She was very 
 pleased that she came ninth in the Los
 Angeles Olympics in 1984.
