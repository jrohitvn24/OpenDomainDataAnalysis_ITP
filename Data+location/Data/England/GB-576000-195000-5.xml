 All Saints Church is dated from the   
 13th century, the tower is 15th       
 century.  In the north aisle is the   
 Humphrey Memorial which is 10 metres  
 high and is made of marble.  The 15th 
 century choir benches have animals    
 carved on them.  There is a good view 
 from the top of the tower.On the east 
 you can see the Crouch Estuary. There 
 is a priest's room which leads, by a  
 spiral staircase, to a flat stone     
 fragment of an intresting coffin lid, 
 dating from the early 13th century.   
 The oldest thing in the church is a   
 slab of stone, which is from the late 
 Norman period, it is beautifully      
 carved with birds and leaves.
