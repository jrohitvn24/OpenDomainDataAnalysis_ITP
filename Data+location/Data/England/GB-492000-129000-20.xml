		<title>20REMINISCENCE IN RHYME</title>
		<content>     By Mrs. Ruby Carne                
                                       
 A world wide slump is the cause today 
 Less working hours and much more pay  
 Mechanical machines do work of staff  
 So man's employment is cut by half.   
                                       
 Shops so efficient one serves oneself 
 With baskets taken from shelf to shelf
 No more the shopkeeper cuts the cheese
 With cheery smile,thankyou or please  
                                       
 As for vandals,that word wasn't known 
 A lot more respect for others shown.  
 But there was mischief always by some 
 Who knew that a good hiding would come
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
