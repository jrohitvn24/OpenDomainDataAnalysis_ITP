		<title>10A RAG AND BONE MAN : HULL</title>
		<content> Old Albie,as he is known locally,is   
 very proud of his trade.He collects   
 old washers,cookers,car exhausts-     
 anything in fact that he can sell to  
 the scrap merchant.For transport he   
 uses a gaily painted cart,pulled by   
 his horse,Ned.Both his father and     
 grandfather owned the cart which in   
 those days had metal rimmed wooden    
 wheels instead of the car wheels he   
 uses now.                             
     Albie tells of the times when he  
 really collected rags and bones,giving
 pennies or balloons to the the        
 children who eagerly listened for his 
 call of "Rag'n bo".He says the bones  
 used to be ground down and made into  
 glue.                                 
     Nowadays more and more unemployed 
 people are trying to to earn money by 
 scrap collecting in vans and even     
 prams and he is glad to be retiring.  </content>
