		<title>10LOCAL HISTORY - CHERINGTON</title>
		<content> 1985 sees the Bicentenary of the      
 publication of Ralph Bigland's        
 "Historical, Monumental and           
 Genealogical Collections Relating to  
 the County of Gloucester" in which he 
 recorded all tombstone inscriptions   
 then extant for the church of St.     
 Nicholas at Cherington. We have been  
 back to see what survives today.      
 Inside the church itself there were   
 16 monuments recorded.  Of these      
 9 can now be positively identified,   
 whilst 7 cannot be traced.  Curiously 
 5 exist today which pre-date Bigalnd, 
 yet are unrecorded by him.  Possibly  
 altered furniture or the removal of   
 pews may have brought these to light. 
 In the churchyard Bigland lists some  
 15 tombs.  Due to two centuries of    
 weathering these Cotswold stone       
 monuments have become largely         
 illegible, only 1 can be identified.  </content>
