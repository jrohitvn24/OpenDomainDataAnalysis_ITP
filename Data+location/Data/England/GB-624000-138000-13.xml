		<title>13THE WARREN</title>
		<content>   The Warren is the area of coastland 
 to the east of Folkestone Harbour and 
 Copt Point.Chalk cliffs lie above blue
 gault clay (highly fossiliferous). The
 Warren has been formed by rotational  
 landslipping of the chalk upon the    
 gault clay,caused by marine erosion   
 and massive slumping of the foot of   
 the gault.Landslides still            
 occasionally occur.Along the coast    
 concrete breakwaters and sea walls    
 have been built as sea defences. At   
 Lydden Spout a freshwater spring      
 appears on the foreshore and numerous 
 adits drain the chalk.                
    The Warren is designated a site of 
 'special scientific interest'.It has  
 areas of grassland with many rare     
 orchids and woodland where the        
 largest colony of Hart's Tongue Fern  
 flourishes.Many migrant birds,        
 especially Nightingales shelter here. </content>
