		<title>02LOVERSALL CHURCH</title>
		<content> Loversall is a very old church, it is 
 even mentioned in the Domesday book,it
 is about 900 years old. It is made out
 of local Limestone. Loversall church  
 needs a lot of repairs because it was 
 broken into a few months ago. They did
 not take much, just a few candles, but
 they did break a stained glass window.
 Just as you come into the church door 
 there is a font where babies are      
 christened. The floor of the church is
 stone with a red carpet down the      
 middle. There are two services every  
 Sunday, one where older people go and 
 another where children go, called     
 Sunday School. The church needs       
 repairing, some of the slates are     
 falling off. Not long ago we had a    
 Flower Festival which lasted three    
 days over the Whitsun Bank Holiday.   
 Nearly everything in the church is    
 original,that is about 11th century.  </content>
