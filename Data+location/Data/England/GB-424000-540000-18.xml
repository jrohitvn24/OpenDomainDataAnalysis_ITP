		<content> At the top of Nevilles Cross bank     
 there was an old Methodist chapel.    
 Next door to the Chapel was a Co-op.  
 store ,butit was closed down a long   
 time ago.Both of these buildings have 
 now been demolished and an extension  
 to the laundry has been built.        
 Next to Millburngate Bridge a new {   
{Shopping Precinct}is being built.The  
 firm building on the site is called   
 "John "Laing".Before it was a precinct
 it was a car park.While it was a car  
 park some excavators unearthed some   
 Saxon remains.                        
 St.Margarets hospital used to be a    
 workhouse for poor people, now it is a
 hospital for old people.
