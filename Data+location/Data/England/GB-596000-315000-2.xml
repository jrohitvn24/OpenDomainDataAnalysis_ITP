 Most of the children in our class went
 to either{Beetley C.P.School}(founded 
 in 1895),or{Gressenhall V.A.School    
 (founded by the squire John David     
 Hay Hill in 1842).Both schools closed 
 in July 1983 because the buildings    
 were old and overcrowded. We all liked
 our old schools very much, there were 
 not so many rules because there were  
 fewer children and they were more     
 friendly places because everybody knew
 each other.                           
 We started coming to our present      
 school in September 1983. It is called
 St.Mary's after the churches of both  
 villages.It has got over 170 children,
 aged from 5-11 years. There are 8     
 teachers on the staff,including one   
 headteacher, and two part timers.It   
 has 6 classrooms,a library and a hall.
