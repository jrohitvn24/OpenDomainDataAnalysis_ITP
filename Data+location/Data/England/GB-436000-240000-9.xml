		<title>09Weaving in Shutford</title>
		<content> Shutford's weaving industry was       
 established in 1747 by Robert Lees of 
 Banbury. The business was aquired by  
 the Wrench family in 1815. In 1851    
 William Wrench employed 23 men. Power 
 looms were introduced in 1885. A fire 
 in Shutford in 1913 destroyed most of 
 the machinery. The business was sold  
 by Mr H E Wrench in 1948 to Messrs J H
 Walker of Dewsbury in Yorkshire and   
 owrk at the Shutford factory came to  
 an end. The velvet fabric produced was
 known as Shutford Plush. It was       
 supplied from Shutford to most of the 
 Royal Courts of Europe including that 
 of Edward VII. The plush was exported 
 to Japan, Persia and South America.
