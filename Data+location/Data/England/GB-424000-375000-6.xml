 We wrote to  the  Severn  Trent water 
 authority and this is the information 
 they gave us. The reservoir and       
 treatment works at Barbrook were built
 in 1908. The reservoir's top water    
 level is 326.7 metres above sea level,
 and it holds 68.5 million gallons     
 (309.1 X 103 m3). Top water level area
 is 32 acres (12.9 hectares) and when  
 full its maximum depth is 7.7 meters. 
 Water from the reservoir is treated in
 the  building at the reservoir and    
 then is distributed to parts of       
 Homesford and Dronfield. Average daily
 output is 500,000.
