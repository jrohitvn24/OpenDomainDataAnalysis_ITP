		<title>19LIVING IN SHERBORNE</title>
		<content>        Sherborne is a quiet place.It  
 hasn't got much traffic,but is mainly 
 fields and farms.I like it because of 
 its quietness and natural beauty.One  
 of the dislikes is there is only one  
 shop.You always have to go to towns to
 buy things.It's a long village.There  
 are old lanes leading to the farms and
 there are a lot of hills and animals. 
 There are good views all around.In the
 valley is the Sherborne brook which   
 has lots of fish. Most of the houses  
 are made of Cotswold stone.There are  
 no activity rooms,and there are very  
 few things like you get in towns,but  
 there are lots of woods and flowers.  
 Sherborne is a small place.There are  
 not many people living here.I like    
 living in Sherborne.
