		<content> rats, stoats,weasels, hedgehogs,      
 pheasants and all the common small    
 birds.  Woodlands are mainly conifers 
 and support most of the above life    
 plus pigeons, magpies, jays, warblers,
 thrushes etc. while heron fish in the 
 pond and beck.  The open ground       
 supports partridge, plover, skylarks, 
 hawk, hare mice etc.  Summer visitors 
 include swallows, swifts &amp; martins    
 while winter brings fieldfare, redwing
 &amp; pigeon.  On average 24 inches of    
 rain falls each year.  It is usually  
 cold enough in January or February to 
 freeze the pond to allow skating for a
 few days and in the summer hot enough 
 to tan the inhabitants.  Gale force   
 winds are sometimes experienced mainly
 in March and November.
