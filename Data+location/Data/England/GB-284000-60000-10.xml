		<content> Torbay Chalet Motel offers full board 
 and can hold 570 people. A guide took 
 us around the camp and we realised    
 that there were many sports facilities
 available e.g. snooker, tennis, table 
 tennis, football, volleyball, putting,
 trampolining and a 3m deep swimming   
 pool. The adventure playground, though
 small had cost Â£20,000.               
 There are 168 chalets and 104 staff.  
 The camp also includes a ballroom,    
 bar, cafe,and television lounge.      
 Asked why they came to the Torbay     
 Chalet Motel some old age pensioners  
 said that they had come with a club   
 whilst a young couple said that it was
 in a brochure. A family said that they
 could recommend it.                   
 The Motel put on events such as       
 Glamourous Grannys, Knobbly Knees etc.
 Most people agreed that they were     
 having an enjoyable time.             </content>
