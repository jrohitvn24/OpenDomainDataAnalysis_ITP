		<title>09WELLCROSS AIRSTRIP, HORSHAM</title>
		<content>   The landing strip at Wellcross      
 Grange,is situated along Five Oaks    
 Road just before Lyon's Corner.       
 Various activities are found here but 
 the main activity is{crop spraying .  
   The farm was built in 1903. The     
 owners have{three aeroplanes}used for 
 spraying crops such as wheat, barley, 
 potatoes, oil-seed rape and grass     
 mainly for cattle grazing.            
   These aeroplanes spray large areas  
 on farms around the Horsham and       
 Slinfold area. A fourth aeroplane is  
 kept, but not used. The landing strip 
 is based a little further out from all
 the buildings. It is a long strip of  
 bare land slightly slanting upwards   
 among the oil-seed rape and other     
 crops.                                
   Amongst the other activities, there 
 is a furniture-making shed where one  
 man deals in making furniture.        </content>
