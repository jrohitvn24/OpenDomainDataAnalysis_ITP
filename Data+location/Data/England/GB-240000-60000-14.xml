		<content> Traditional Foods: The Pasty (Pastie) 
 was originally a meal for Cornish tin 
 miners. It consists of an oval-shaped 
 pastry casing, folded and crimped     
 together along one side, containing a 
 savoury filling of diced meat,        
 potatoes and onion. It is cooked in an
 oven and can be eaten hot or cold. The
 miners did not eat the pastry casing  
 but, when opened, used it as a 'plate'
 to rest on the dirty rocks or floor of
 the mine.The original pasty might also
 be meat &amp; sweet, with potatoe and meat
 at one end and apple at the other.    
 Star Gazey Pie consists of herrings   
 baked in a dish with a pastry lid and 
 is served with the fish heads poking  
 through the pastry.  A Cornigh Cream  
 Tea consists of scones (small cakes)  
 spread with home-made jam and clotted 
 cream (skimming from the top of boiled
 milk).                                </content>
