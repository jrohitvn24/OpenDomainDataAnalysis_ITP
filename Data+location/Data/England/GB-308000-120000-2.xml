		<title>02THE RIVER TONE</title>
		<content> The river Tone runs through six of our
 twelve KM squares. It starts up in the
 Brendon hills where lots of little    
 streams, called tributies, run        
 together. Then it comes down through  
 Wellisford and Thorne St Margret and  
 then through Runnington and           
 Wellington. Here the river is wider   
 and deeper and beside it runs the     
 remains of the Great Western canal.   
 Eventually it joins the river Parrat  
 which runs through Bridgewater and out
 at Bridgewater bay.                   
 There are trees growing along side    
 the river which are mainly Alder. The 
 river is the habitat for many         
 different birds.This part of the river
 isn't yet polluted and people often   
 fish along its banks but only for     
 minnoes,trout and possibly eels.
