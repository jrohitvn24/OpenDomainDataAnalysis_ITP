		<title>19Beech, Near Alton</title>
		<content>    I live in Beech, which is built    
 beside the road between Alton and     
 Medstead. It is a quiet village to the
 west of Alton, with many bungalows and
 houses. It is surrounded by fields and
 a Forestry Commission woodland, where 
 people can walk along paths in the    
 forest. The village has a small church
 with a corrugated iron roof and a     
 village hall in which a youth club,   
 scout troop and brownies meet and     
 flower shows are held. Car boot sales 
 are held there too.                   
    At the end of Beech is King's Hill.
 There is an Abbey where monks stay.   
 Every summer they have fruit picking  
 where you can go and pick strawberries
 and gooseberries. Very near the Abbey 
 there is a little shop called Abbey   
 Stores.                               
   One of the houses in Beech is a farm
 with sheep and hens. It sells plants. </content>
