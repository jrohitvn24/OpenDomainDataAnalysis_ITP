		<content>{My name is Pam;}I am 38, with two     
 children aged 18mths. &amp; 7yrs. My      
 husband is a manager in a medium sized
 engineering firm on the outskirts of  
 Birmingham 45mins car journey away. My
 house is detached in 1/4 acre.        
   My Wednesday &lt;like every other day> 
 starts at 7.15 with a shower and      
 breakfast. My{husband leaves the house
 at 7.30. I turn on Radio 4 &amp; prepare  
 the children's breakfast: tea,        
 Shreddies, toast &amp; butter. Then I see 
 that Michael is dressed, &amp; bath &amp;     
 dress Clare. Next I take Michael to   
 the{village school}50yds away. I do   
 some housework before going to        
{Playgroup}at 9.45. I take another Mum 
 in my old Mini to Chorley Village     
 Hall, 3miles away. We open the        
 hall &amp; lock up after the session at   
 midday before driving{home for lunch.
