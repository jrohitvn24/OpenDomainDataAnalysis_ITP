		<title>01Sywell - an introduction</title>
		<content>Sywell is a small village, N.E. of     
Northampton. It is divided into two    
parts - the old and the new. The houses
in the old village are more than 150   
years old. They were built around the  
church. Next to the church is the      
original school. The old buildings are 
built of local Northamptonshire sand   
and ironstone. There used to be a post 
office and a pub. The new village has  
been built since the 1930's. There are 
mostly bungalows along the main road   
with very large gardens. There are some
large and grand houses, some with      
swimming pools. The only shop is in the
new part and opposite this is the      
primary school. There is one pub       
(The Horseshoe) with a garden. There is
an airport for light planes and some   
light industry. There is a motel with a
restaurant and bars. Most of the land  
around Sywell is farmland.             </content>
