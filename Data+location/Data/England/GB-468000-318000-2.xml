		<content> Asfordby is alright as it is because  
 if anything big and bulky was built it
 would be too big for a village.Then   
 when the builders got here they would 
 probably start messing about with     
 things that don't concern them and    
 ruin the bit of countryside that      
 Asfordby has.                         
 I think that Asfordby is a nice place 
 to live.I think it is better than     
 Melton Mowbray because in places in   
 Melton Mowbray it is like living in a 
 battlefield with all the traffic      
 zooming around.
