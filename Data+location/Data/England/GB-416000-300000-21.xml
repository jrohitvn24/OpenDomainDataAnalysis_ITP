<title>21A5 Bypass</title>

<content>



This Bypass has been built and carrys the majority of traffic into, out of and through Tamworth. Probably the main reason for the development at Ventura shopping park making it easily accessable to all visitors. The bypass has relieved traffic on the A5 and has since led to the construction of the Hints bypass which is an extention on the old bypass taking commuters and heavy goods vehicles direct between the M42 and A38. The road has probably spilt the town in two now however, most noticeably on Kettlebrook road which has been completely disected.   &lt;br />
