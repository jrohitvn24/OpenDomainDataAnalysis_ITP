 set up . Inside the tent are displays 
 of flowers, vegetables, jams, cakes,  
 wines, hand made crafts, photographs  
 and work done by the local schools.

 other refreshments.                   
                                       
   Around the field there are trade    
 stands and pens where farmers show off
 their best sheep, cattle and goats.
