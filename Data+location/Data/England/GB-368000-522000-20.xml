		<content> A tin &amp; wood building,but well cared  
 for,this hall has a surprising amount 
 of room.Two domino drives are held    
 monthly,with 40-80 people attending.  
 One is arranged by the Institute      
 committee to cover running costs, &amp;   
 the other is a charity event,which has
 been going on successfully for 8 years
 in aid of Kidney Research.The WI use  
 the hall for monthly meetings,&amp; the   
 church Tuesday Group hold a childrens'
 Christmas party.In 1985,a school party
 from France used the building during a
 2 weeks camping holiday nearby, &amp; a   
 church group,walking the Pennine Way, 
 stayed overnight.
