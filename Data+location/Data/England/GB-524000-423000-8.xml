		<title>08THE VILLAGE OF KEYINGHAM</title>
		<content> Keyingham has been split into two     
 halves, with the A1033 Hull to        
 Withernsea road being the dividing    
 line. The north side of the village   
 being more developed with residential 
 housing and shops. The church of      
 England is on this side and the       
 village hall, much used by the many   
 village organisations. The south side 
 of Keyingham, while having much less  
 houses, does have shops along the main
 street, the two schools, both doctors 
 surgeries and the Methodist church    
 which allows its hall to be used as a 
 child welfare clinic once a month.    
 There is also a playing field which is
 shared by the junior school and local 
 residents. Once again a place with a  
 sense of community, with most people  
 knowing each other and choosing to    
 live there to sample country life     
 rather than living there for necessity</content>
