		<title>19Horses in Holmes.</title>
		<content> There are two types of horses in the  
 area Shires and Riding Horses.        
   The shires were used to work before 
 tractors were invented. They maybe    
 pulled carts, canal barges or ploughs.
 Now the shire horses are all on one   
 farm and are the Clydesdale Breed. The
 horses are famous for winning prizes  
 at many shows and are mostly exported 
 to Canada and America.                
   At the next farm Becconsall Stables 
 they stable about 35 horses. Some     
 belong to the stables  and some belong
 to riders who stable them there. There
 is a big indoor riding school. Horses 
 are "broken in" and trained. They hold
 shows and jumping competitions.       
 Children and adults can have riding   
 lessons. There are many fields round  
 the stables where the horses are      
 grazed and ridden. The stables are    
 kept busy.                            </content>
