		<title>15EVERTHORPE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>                                       
      Everthorpe is a small village. We
 walked from school to Everthorpe.  We 
 went along a public footpath across   
 some fields to get there.             
      We counted six farms as we walked
 around the village and about forty six
 houses.  There was one market garden. 
      Some of the farms had cattle but 
 most of them were arable farming.     
      The only amenities we could find 
 were a telephone kiosk with a post box
 attached to it.                       
      We walked back to school along   
 Shaw Lane and Ferry Road.  We walked  
 by The Youth Custody Centre and The   
 Telephone Exchange.  We were now back 
 in South Cave.
