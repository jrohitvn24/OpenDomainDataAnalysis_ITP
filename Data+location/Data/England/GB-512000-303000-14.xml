		<title>14John Clare (poet)</title>
		<content> John Clare was a poet who lived in    
 Helpston many years ago.He came from a
 poor background but got a little      
 education in the church porch at      
 Glinton.There is still evidence of    
 this as he inscribed his name on the  
 wall.                                 
   John Clare worked on a farm.The farm
 was owned by the Jones family.While   
 John was working on the farm he fell  
 in love with Mr. Jones's daughter     
 Mary.But he was not considered a      
 suitable match for her because of his 
 earlier life.                         
   Later John started to write         
 poetry.Most of his poems were         
 discriptions and rural matters.In 1837
 he went insane and was sent to an     
 asylum where he died in 1864.
