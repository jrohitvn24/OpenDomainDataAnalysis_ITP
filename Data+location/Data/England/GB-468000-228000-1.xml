		<title>01PADBURY AND HILLESDEN</title>
		<content> The area contains the main street of  
 the old village of Padbury in the     
 northeast corner and the village of   
 Hillesden on the western boundary. The
 land between consists almost entirely 
 of farms, with a tributary of the     
 Great Ouse flowing through from south 
 to north. On the right bank of the    
 river is Padbury Mill. In front of the
 mill is the site of an iron-age       
 village,Norbury. Off the main street  
 is "Old End" the site of the          
 Anglo-saxon village.The old village   
 school still stands but is now the    
 Village Hall.  Hillesden is also an   
 ancient settlemet but now much smaller
 than Padbury. The magnificent church  
 which dates from the 13th century     
 crowns the scattered village. The     
 school still stands but is now a      
 private house.
