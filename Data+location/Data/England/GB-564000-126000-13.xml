		<title>13Farming around Stonegate</title>
		<content> Although the land cover statistics    
 show a dominance of grassland,the     
 farming still shows much variety.     
 The grassland is used for hay and     
 silage production, and for grazing by 
 cattle,sheep and horses.The main      
 breeds of cattle are Friesian and     
 Sussex.Several types of sheep are kept
 including Kent and Mule - the latter  
 being a cross between a blue-faced    
 Leicester ram and a black-faced hill- 
 sheep ewe.Horses are kept for riding  
 and shire horses for exhibition.      
                                       
 The main crops grown include barley,  
 wheat,oats and hops.                  
 _                                     
 Goats,chicken,ducks and bees are often
 kept,but usually on a small scale.
