 village raft and bed races. The       
 Somershey Theatre, inaugurated in     
 1985, has risen from a barn in a      
 cottage garden. So far productions    
 have been for solo actors, with       
 aprofessional assisted by local       
 amateurs. Weather permitting, fetes,  
 garden parties &amp; carnivals abound. The
