		<content>    The primary school was built in    
 1870 for children of the village.     
 Since 1960 it has acquired extra      
 wooden classrooms to accomodate       
 children from Roborough and St. Giles 
 villages, where the schools were      
 closed.  The numbers on roll in the   
 summer of 1985 were 91 children, aged 
 5 to 11 years, plus 16 part-time      
 nursery children.  In 1984 another    
 wooden classroom was installed.  The  
 school has a large playing field, part
 of Rye Parks field, used for sports,  
 soccer and fetes.                     
   An active Parents-Teachers          
 Association mounts several activities 
 each year and supports the school with
 extra finance.                        
   The children from the other villages
 are bused to and from school, and on  
 reaching the age of 11 years, children
 usually go on to Gt. Torrington Comp. </content>
