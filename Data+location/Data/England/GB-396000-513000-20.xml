		<content> The major employer in Teesdale Is the 
 pharmaceutical giant Glaxo's Barnard  
 Castle factory.Such dependance on a   
 single employer cannot be the best    
 thing for an area whose history of    
 employment has been that of the small 
 family farm supplemented by part-time 
 employment in the mineral extractive  
 industry.The way forward is probably  
 through a major expansion in service  
 industry(Tourism)backed up by an      
 increase in forestry work and a move  
 towards adding value to the products  
 of Teesdale's agricultural industry by
 more processing of food products on   
 the spot.A promotion of greater       
 awareness among the local population  
 of the cash value to the local        
 economy of the assets of landscape and
 amenity which they take for granted   
 would do much to generate the         
 employment to keep the area alive.    </content>
