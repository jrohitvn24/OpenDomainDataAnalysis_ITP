		<content>  Devon has a great deal to offer to   
 tourists,{natural beauty,peace and    
{quiet}and a{good climate.}As such     
 travellers with{caravans}are a common 
 sight (and possible nuisance) during  
 the summer months.                    
  Both Battisford and Tuxton farms     
 allow{caravans}on their land,whilst at
 West Pitten and Smithaleigh{Bed and   
{Breakfast}is advertised.              
  Smithaleigh also uses 5 acres as a   
 touring{caravan and tent park}and once
 they install a laundry block they can 
 increase their number from 50 to 100. 
  A{children's farm}nearby shows common
 farm animals together with cottage    
 industries{Pottery,Weaving and Stained
{Glass}and has facilities to provide   
 cream teas.                           
  Many farms are themselves an         
 attraction dating back as they do     
 hundreds of years.                    </content>
