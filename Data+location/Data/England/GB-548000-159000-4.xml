		<content>   Halstead has a{Parish Council       
 consisting of{seven councillors}and   
 elections are held{every four years.  
   Mr William Rushen, an old boy of the
 school came to see us. He is the      
 chairman of the Parish Council, and   
 was elected by the six other          
 councillors. He has been the chairman 
 for eight years.                      
   Councillors are unpaid and look     
 after the play equipment on the       
{recreation ground.}They see that the  
{footpaths}are all right with no trees 
 across them, and comment on{planning  
{applications.}The money they use comes
 from Sevenoaks District Council and   
 is about{Â£4000 per year.              
  The chairman said the main worries of
 people in Halstead at the moment are  
 vandalism, planning applications,     
 public transport and rubbish          
 collections.                          </content>
