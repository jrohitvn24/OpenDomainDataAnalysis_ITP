		<title>13THE REVEREND HILDYARD</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
   The Reverend Hildyard seemed to be a
 very interesting man.  He called      
 himself Ingoldsby, after the village  
 and always signed himself Ingoldsby in
 his letters.  He wrote many letters   
 about the revision of the Book of     
 Common Prayer, these have been printed
 in a book known as The Ingoldsby      
 Letters.                              
    The Reverend was taken to court in 
 Victorian times because he thrashed a 
 boy from the village.The boys name was
 Schofield, we think that there are    
 some members of his family buried in  
 the graveyard in Ingoldsby. He was    
 fined Â£5 , the village policeman was  
 also fined 10s. for helping him. The  
 lime tree in front of the house is the
 same one under which the boy was      
 thrashed.                             </content>
