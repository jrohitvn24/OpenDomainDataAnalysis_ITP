		<title>16Natural History of Brownsea</title>
		<content> Brownsea Island has been owned by the 
 National Trust since 1962. Prior to   
 that it had been allowed to run wild  
 creating interesting animal and plant 
 communitites. One of the main features
 is the flourishing red squirrel       
 population- grey squirrels have never 
 reached the island. There are few     
 other mammals; no badgers,foxes,      
 weasels, stoats or other carnivorous  
 mammals. There are Brown Rats, Shrews,
 Pigmey Shrews, Wood Mice, and Harvest 
 Mice, but no Voles. There are no      
 snakes so reptiles are represented by 
 Lizards- Slow Worm, Common LIzard, and
 the rarer Sand Lizard.                
 Common heathland and woodland plants  
 are to be found and interesting salt  
 and freshwater marsh communities.     
 There is a large band of rhodendron   
 growth down the centre of the island  
 and daffodil fields on the south side.</content>
