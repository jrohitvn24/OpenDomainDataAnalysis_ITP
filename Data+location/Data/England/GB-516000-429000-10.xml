 Preston lies in the middle of the     
 country's largest pig farming         
 concentration.  Naturally therefore   
 the area itself tends to reflect this 
 fact.  There is a large slaughterhouse
 which deals almost exclusively with   
 pig meat. The slaughterhouse owned by 
 the Rawson family, is a large employer
 of labour.                            
 Within our area there are 2 small     
 engineering workshops, one owned by   
 the Jones Brothers which produces pipe
 work and metal fabrications and       
 another which produces smaller scale  
 farm related items.                   
 Several large farms and one very large
 garden centre provide employment for  
 local labour.
