		<content>my house was probably oriinally built  
in the sixteenth century and then      
appears to have been at least          
partially burnt down.(we can tell this 
because heating has turned some of the 
stone red)we think it was a yeoman     
farmers house.after the fire the ruin  
of the old yeomans house was built     
into two cottages making the house     
thinner and lower (the centre beam for 
example is not in the centre now.)the  
fireplaces were not altered and so they
were much too large for small labourers
cottages.one end was added about one   
hundred years ago it was a strange     
shape and is built of different stone. 
This end has at different times been a 
shop and a coffee tavern.The people    
that used to own the house were called 
Prince(that is why our house is called 
Princes Row).They were rose growers &amp;  
their workers lived in the house.      </content>
