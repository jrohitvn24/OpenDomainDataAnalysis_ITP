		<title>16MOBILE LIBRARY IN MILDENHALL</title>
		<content> The{mobile library service}to the     
 villages around Marlborough has been  
 operating since 1959.The van is well  
 equipped for its task.It is a 28 foot 
 Bedford van with 2,823 books, to cater
 for all tastes.The current annual cost
 of running the van is Â£3,250.Every two
 weeks the van visits places which are 
 too small and isolated to have a      
 permanent library.On a typical day in 
 the Kennet valley area the van travels
 40 miles, stopping in all the villages
 such as Mildenhall and Axford.        
  Unfortunately only about 30% of the  
 people in the villages use the        
 library.People questioned in Axford   
 and Mildenhall said they were too old 
 to get to the van's stopping place, or
 were too busy with young children to  
 read.However many people appreciated  
 the social contact provided by the    
 service.                              </content>
