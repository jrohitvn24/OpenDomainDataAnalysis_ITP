		<content> Services still available to the area  
 are limited to a twice daily postal   
 collection, weekly refuse collection  
 and weekly mobile library. Social     
 activities are centred on the Parish  
 Room which is the venue for the       
 monthly meeting of the Stanford with  
 Postling Womens Institute. A Craft    
 Fair is held by this organisation     
 yearly, the Church organises a        
 Christmas Fair at the beginning of    
 December and there is also a Summer   
 Fete. Meetings of the British Legion  
 are held at various locations in the  
 village throughout the year. There is 
 at least one service every Sunday at  
 the Church of All Saints which is     
 fairly well attended. In short        
 villagers are trying to keep the      
 community spirit alive under          
 increasing difficulties.
