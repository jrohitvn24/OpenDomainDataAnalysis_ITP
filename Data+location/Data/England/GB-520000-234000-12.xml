		<content> When the Letchworth Garden City       
 Company was founded in 1903 the       
 intention was to surround the City by 
 a Green Belt of farmland as well as   
 each house having its own garden and  
 the city itself laid out with wide    
 tree lined streets.There are still,82 
 years later some 2,400 acres of       
 farmland around the city despite a    
 great deal of building having been    
 done.In our area north of the city    
 there are 800 acres put down to arable
 farming,farmed by the Garden City     
 farm management,headed by Mr          
 Salway.The crops grown are largely    
 cereals,wheat and barley and also     
 large ares of Oil-seed Rape which is  
 used in the manufcture of             
 margarine.Some peas and potatoes are  
 also grown.
