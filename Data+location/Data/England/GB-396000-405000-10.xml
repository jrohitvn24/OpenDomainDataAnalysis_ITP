		<content>    The picturesque{Pennine village of 
{Delph}is situated in the valley of the
 River Tame surrounded by well kept    
 moorland fields enclosed by dry stone 
 walls. It is a{small, quiet village   
 with one main street (A6052) and      
 several side streets. The main A62    
 Oldham to Huddersfield road passes    
 through the southern end of the       
 village.                              
    Most of the{buildings}are          
 constructed from local Millstone Grit 
 and most date from{Victorian times and
{earlier.}There are many old{handloom  
{weavers' cottages}with their          
 distinctive mullioned windows. Some   
 are black from the atmospheric        
 pollution but many have been          
{sandblasted}clean recently. There are 
 modern houses too; large, detached and
 expensive and often built in the local
 stone to blend in with older property.</content>
