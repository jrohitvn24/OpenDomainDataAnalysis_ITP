		<content> Park Farm is now a rest home for old  
 people, which is run by Mrs Pratt. It 
 is about 385 years old and it has a   
 land cover of 4 acres. It is owned by 
 the Hampshire County Council but it   
 was owned by the Reeve of Hampshire   
 and was built for him by the Earl of  
 Southampton who used it as a hunting  
 lodge. It is priced at a hundred      
 thousand pounds. It's surroundings are
 trees and grass lands and grazing     
 lands for deer and other forest       
 animals. The house itself is very big 
 having twelve rooms. The house now is 
 listed by the Department of the       
 Environment in London as a category   
 grade two building.In 1743 another    
 story was added on on top.Mrs Pratt   
 told us she found a 1753 penny in     
 between the two stories.
