		<content> There's alot of wildlife in and around
 the canal.The fish do well in the     
 canal but sometimes there is pollution
 which kills the fish.There are various
 types of fish in the canal,one of the 
 most common is the stickleback but    
 there is also                         
 dace,perch,pike,eels,gugeon,ruffe,    
 roach,Millers Thumb or Bullhead,chub  
 and bream.There are quite a few people
 that come to fish in the canal.There  
 are some water birds that go to the   
 canal aswell.These are some of them   
 mallard,moorhen,swan and heron.There  
 are not many birds that go on the     
 canal because alot of boats go there  
 and it disturbs the birds.There are   
 water voles which make their nest in  
 the side of the canal.We also get     
 damsel flies there.
