		<title>18THE MAN THEY COULDN'T HANG</title>
		<content> John Lee was born in Abbotskerswell in
 the late 19th century.After being put 
 in jail for pawning his employer's    
 silver he was released by a Miss Keyse
 One night servants in the house smelt 
 burning in Miss Keyes' room.They ran  
 in and found her lying on the floor   
 with her head battered in. Later they 
 found blood on Lee's clothes and an   
 oil can and knife in his room. He     
 was tried and in half an hour         
 condemned to death. It was then that  
 his mum said "John will never hang."  
 Lee kept very cool about it and said  
 "The Lord knows I have done no wrong  
 and he will save me." Remaining calm  
 on execution day he even helped the   
 executioner tie the noose.The trapdoor
 was pulled.Nothing happened.Twice more
 it was pulled.It was stamped on,oiled,
 tested but each time failed to open.At
 last Lee's sentence was commuted.     </content>
