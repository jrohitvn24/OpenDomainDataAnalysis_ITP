		<title>12Living in Stanwell cont.</title>
		<content> Some people we talked to can remember 
 when Stanwell was nearly all fields   
 belonging to a family called Purser.  
                                       
 On the village green there is an old  
 plane tree that used to have a bench  
 around it. The tree grew too big so   
 they had to take the seat away.       
                                       
 Kelly's great great Grandad was the   
 village blacksmith and the forge was  
 where the DIY shop is now.            
                                       
 A lot of our land around Stanwell has 
 been used for gravel pits. That's     
 because of all the motorway building. 
 Lots more of the land has been used to
 build houses. The airport used up the 
 most.                                 
                                       
 Stanwell is still a good place to live
 though. Sharan Kundi 8yrs             </content>
