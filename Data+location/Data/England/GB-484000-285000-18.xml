		<title>18A MODERN FACTORY</title>
		<content> The{British American Tobacco}         
 factory                               
 is big, inside it is{automatic.}It    
 looks extremely well planned and it   
 blends in well with its surroundings, 
 they have{planted more than 40,000    
{trees and shrubs}to make it blend in. 
 It looked a bit smarter than an       
 ordinary factory because it was so    
 well shaped and painted.What most     
 impressed me was all the{computers    
 that are used for security and        
 things,the factory came to Corby      
 because it was near port Felixstowe,  
 the M1, the M6, Manchester, Liverpool 
 and Southampton.It only{employed 40   
{workers}which greatly astonished me,it
 has only been here about 2 years.The  
 planners obviously care about Great   
 Oakley because there is{no sign at all
{of them polluting}the area.I think the
 factory is making a{good profit.      </content>
