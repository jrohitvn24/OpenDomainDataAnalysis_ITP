		<title>14The Comunity Centre</title>
		<content> Within the village of Evenwood there  
 has recently opened a Community       
 Centre.This centre is in what used to 
 be the old primary school.When a new  
 school was built work was begun on the
 old one to convert it into the centre.
   The centre which is now fully       
 operational provides many varied      
 activities for the people of the area.
 Some of the activeties organised are  
 luncheon clubs etc. for the elderly,  
 adult literacy classes,art classes,   
 flower arranging etc.For the young    
 people they have junior and senior    
 youth clubs,discos,play groups and    
 dancing classes. Also incorparated    
 within the site is the county lending 
 libary for the town.This is open twice
 a week on Tuesdays and Fridays.The    
 community centre is a very well       
 supported local facilty.
