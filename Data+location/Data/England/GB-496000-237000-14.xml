		<content> HOUSING IN THE AREA CONSISTS MAINLY OF
 POST WAR DEVELOPMENT. THERE ARE A FEW 
 OLDER PROPERTIES MOST OF WHICH  DATE  
 FROM AROUND 1850, BUT SOME FROM AS FAR
 BACK AS THE 17TH CENTURY.             
                                       
 THE MAJORITY OF HOUSES ARE PRIVATELY  
 OWNED, THE OTHERS BEING RENTED OUT BY 
 THE DISTRICT COUNCIL OR A PROPERTY    
 COMPANY.                              
                                       
 AT PRESENT IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN  
 PLANNING PERMISSION FOR NEW           
 DEVELOPMENTS DUE TO THE CURRENT POLICY
 OF "INFILL DEVELOPMENT ONLY" AND THE  
 SEWERAGE SYSTEM BEING AT FULL         
 CAPACITY.                             
                                       
 THERE IS NO MAINS GAS IN THE AREA, THE
 ONLY MEANS OF HOUSEHOLD POWER BEING   
 ELECTRICITY,OIL,SOLID FUEL AND        
 LIQUIFIED PETROLEUM GAS.              </content>
