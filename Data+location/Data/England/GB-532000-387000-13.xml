		<title>13Hubbards Hills</title>
		<content> Perhaps the most famous place in Louth
 is Hubbards Hills.It is a valley      
 carved out by meltwater streams during
 the last Ice age.In places it is 100  
 feet deep and it covers 14 hectares.  
 During the 18 hundreds the valley and 
 surrounding hills came into the       
 possesion of Auguste Alphonse Pahud.  
 He came from Switzerland to teach     
 languages at King Edward IV Grammar   
 School. His wife died suddenly and    
 Pahud committed suicide leaving the   
 hills to the people of Louth. Today   
 the land is protected and is a        
 favourite place for wildlife and      
 recreation.                           
   Louth has a uniqe position on the   
 Greenwich Meridian longitude line. In 
 1948 a plaque was erected on Eastgate 
 to mark its position.Every day        
 hundreds of people pass from East to  
 West without realising it.            </content>
