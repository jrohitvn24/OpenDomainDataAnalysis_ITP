		<content> Built in 1982, it is the 2nd largest  
 in Gtr. Manchester and serves an area 
 covering local Stockport districts to 
 Bolton, 20 miles to the North East.   
                                       
 In the bus station there are 6 bays   
 where buses can come in and depart.   
 The rows of bus shelters are lettered 
 from A-Z which makes it easier for    
 people to find the service they want. 
 A control tower and information office
 are located near the A6. At the bus   
 station there are 184 buses, 600      
 drivers and 12 inspectors as well as  
 office and garage workers.            
                                       
 Under the viaduct are 2 garages where 
 they wash and repair the buses as well
 as refilling them with diesel,changing
 their tyres and housing them for the  
 night.
