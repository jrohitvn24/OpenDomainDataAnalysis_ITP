		<title>12WARESIDE VILLAGE STORES</title>
		<content> Every morning is the same at the      
 village stores.Dad wakes mum with a   
 cup of coffee.My brother delivers the 
 papers.Eventually I emerge from bed.I 
 have to wash,dress and tidy my room by
 eight o'clock.By then my brother is   
 serving early customers and calling   
 for me to take over so that he can    
 catch the school bus to Hertford.Soon 
 mum appears while I finish in the     
 house.                                
 By the time I arrive at school I'm    
 fully awake for what lies ahead.School
 is generally interesting although if  
 I'm tired my mind wanders,I lose      
 concentration,go into a daydream and  
 switch off lessons.                   
 School is out by half past three.I    
 play tennis or bowls with my friend   
 till seven o'clock.In winter I go home
 to watch television or a video.
