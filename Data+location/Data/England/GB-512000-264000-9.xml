		<content>    When we are four and a half years  
 old we can start school.Children from 
 outlying farms are picked up by taxi, 
 and all the Perry children come by    
 bus.                                  
    Our school has about 155 children  
 and six classes, each with its own    
 teacher. Our school uniform colours   
 are maroon and grey, and we have our  
 own, specially designed sweatshirt.   
    School starts at 8.45 a.m. and     
 finishes at 3.15 p.m. Nearly all the  
 children stay at school at dinner     
 time, but about a half of us bring a  
 packed lunch instead of eating the    
 school-prepared meal.                 
    We are a very happy school; the    
 older children like to play with the  
 little ones at playtime and help them.
    Our P.T.A. raises money to buy us  
 some 'extras'. When we are 11 most of 
 us go to Longsands School in St.Neots.</content>
