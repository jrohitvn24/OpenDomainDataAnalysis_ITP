 technology has changed drastically.

 20 years.In the police force they work
 in 8 hour shifts.In life,crime is ever
 increasing.The pubs in the area are   
 well run and they do not have a       
 reputation for fights.The policeman   
 keeps an eye on local discos and      
 parties in case of trouble.In
