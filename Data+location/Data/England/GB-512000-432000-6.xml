		<title>06The Old Hull to Hornsea Line</title>
		<content>   We studied the old{railway}line,    
 closed 20 years ago, between Ganstead 
 and Swine. There are no traces of the 
 track now, just black cinders. We     
 walked along the track to the old     
 station. It was derelict. There were  
 holes in the wooden floor and no glass
 in the windows. There were the brick  
 remains of coal cellars and we found a
 rusty nut and bolt.                   
   Along the track we saw dandelion,   
 clover and dog roses growing. There   
 were ants, butterflies, bees and some 
 rabbit pellets lying near the side of 
 the track.                            
   Opposite the station Mr &amp; Mrs       
 Southcoat live in Eastview Cottage.   
 They have been married 59 years and   
 they could remember when they used to 
 catch the train to{Hornsea}to do their
 shopping.
