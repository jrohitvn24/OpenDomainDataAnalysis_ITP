		<title>19BELSIZE VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> The main feature of Belsize,now that  
 all the shops have disappeared is the 
 pub.The pub has always had a great    
 significance since it was built,to the
 extent that the locals did not call   
 the village by its proper name but    
 insisted on calling it 'The Plough'.  
 Although the village has no shops     
 mobile shops and library do visit the 
 village.                              
 Many of the farms are run as they     
 always have been,although Ollieberrie 
 Farm,has been converted from three    
 small farm cottages into a large      
 private house.                        
 During the Second World War,the       
 German's were given false information 
 about where their V.1.flying bombs    
 were landing,so they increased the    
 range. Becuase of this two flying     
 bombs came down close to Belsize,but  
 did no damage.                        </content>
