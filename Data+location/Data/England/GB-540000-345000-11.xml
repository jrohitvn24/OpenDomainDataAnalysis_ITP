		<content> Although the land is intensively      
 farmed there are several areas of     
 mature trees and hedges,some open     
 grassland and the outmarsh which are  
 havens for wildlife.The drainage dykes
 are usually heavily polluted by       
 fertilizer and pesticides and do not  
 contain much wildlife beyond rats and 
 water voles.Mammals are represented by
 foxes,stoats and weasels,rabbits and  
 hares,grey squirrels,shrews,mice and  
 the ubiquitous rat.The grey squirrels 
 are confined to one small area and    
 have only arrived in the district     
 within the last three years and there 
 are now at least half a dozen.Foxes   
 and hares are fairly intensively shot 
 but tend still to survive in fair     
 numbers.Rabbits are no longer as      
 common as they used to be because of  
 myxamatosis which is still present in 
 the area.                             </content>
