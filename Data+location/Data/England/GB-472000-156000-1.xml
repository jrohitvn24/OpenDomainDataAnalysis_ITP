		<content>{ MATTINGLEY, DIPLEY}&amp;{HAZELEY}suggest 
 that the area was once an extensive   
 forest until clearings were made for  
 these tiny villages.{Street End Copse 
 survives as a large area of woodland  
 to the SW of the block whilst{Hazeley 
{Heath}covers a large part of the NE   
 corner of the block. The latter       
 (reaching 88m above sea level)        
 provides some fine views across the   
 block.                                
  The{River Whitewater}flows from South
 to North through the centre of the    
 block some 30m below Hazeley Heath.   
 The floodplain of this stream is low- 
 lying &amp; provides a route for a line of
 electricity pylons which create their 
 own mark on the landscape. The{River  
{Hart}just enters the NE corner of the 
 block. The remainder of the block     
 (approximately two thirds of the area)
 is farmed - see 'Farming'.            </content>
