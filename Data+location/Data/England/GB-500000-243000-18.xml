		<content> At the weekend from 10am till 4pm you 
 can go to the the stables and book a  
 ride.It is Â£3 for a ride and you can  
 choose your own horse or pony. There  
 are three places you can go: they are 
 a field called  Killpitts for         
 beginners with an instrutor called    
 Dawn.The next field is called the     
 Chequers Inn.There is a field  behind 
 it. It is the paddock. People call it 
 the middle ride and there is an       
 instructor called Jackie. Then there  
 is the big ride that goes round the   
 fields. You have an instructor called 
 Maureen for that.It is mainly girls   
 who go to the riding school. I go     
 because I like horses very much and   
 enjoy riding.
