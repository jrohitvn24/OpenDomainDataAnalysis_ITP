		<title>10THE LINHOPE BURN</title>
		<content> The Linhope burn is one of the major  
 tributaries of the river Breamish. It 
 joins the Breamish just south of      
 Linhope. There is a narrow bridge into
 Linhope across the burn. Along much of
 its length in this area, the burn is  
 in a steep-sided valley which         
 eventually becomes a deep gorge which 
 has woods running down both sides. The
 burn is rocky and has large boulders  
 in it along its length. It is narrow  
 and fast-flowing with occasional deep 
 holes. A major feature of this burn   
 are the number of waterfalls along its
 short length. The best known of these 
 is Linhope Spout but is just out of   
 this area. The remainder of the       
 waterfalls tend to be in the gorge    
 NW of Linhope but are on private land 
 belonging to the big house.
