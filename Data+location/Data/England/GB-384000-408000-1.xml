 Heywood is an industrial town of      
 27,000 people, part of the Borough of 
 Rochdale. It is not mentioned in the  
 original Domesday book but Rochdale   
 is,as "Recedham".The main industry    
 was textiles, especially the spinning 
 and weaving of cotton. That has now   
 declined and new light industries have
 developed around the old mills. The   
 motorway system and the proximity of  
 Manchester have led to the growth of  
 a large number of storage depots.Being
 part of Rochdale is a major factor in 
 the town's recent development and the 
 loss of identity is a real fear.This, 
 and the threat of unemployment, will  
 be some of the concerns we will look  
 at, as well as some possible future   
 trends. We begin by looking at some of
 the present features that remind us of
 the past.{           }                </content>
