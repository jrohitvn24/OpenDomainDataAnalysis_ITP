		<title>08      TORBAY RAILWAY</title>
		<content>   The Dartmouth and Torbay Railway was
 opened on August 16th 1864.The        
 station buildings were completed      
 several months later.The line  was    
 operated by the South Devon railway.  
 It is  now operated by the Dart valley
 Railway Association,a private         
 company.                              
   Kingswear is at the end of the line 
 from Paignton.There are two lines of  
 track beween Paignton and Kingswear.  
 Originally both lines were broad gauge
 but in May 1892 the track was         
 converted in one weekend to the       
 standard gauge now used. The engines  
 are all original steam engines and the
 trains are painted in the original    
 livery.
