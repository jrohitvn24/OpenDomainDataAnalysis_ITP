		<title>13FORD CASTLE</title>
		<content>          FORD CASTLE                  
   There has been a castle since       
 1338,when William Heron was given     
 permission to crenellate his dwelling 
 in Ford.In 1385 the castle was taken  
 by the Scots and held by them until   
 the next year.                        
   Shortly before the battle of Flodden
 in 1513, the castle was taken by      
 James IV of Scotland.The owner,William
 Heron,was being held prisoner in      
 Scotland and the castle was severely  
 damaged by the time the Scottish army 
 left to take up its position for      
 battle.In 1822 the Marquis of         
 Waterford inherited the castle.       
   During her years at Ford,Lady       
 Waterford made many alterations and   
 the castle to-day is largely the      
 result of changes made at that time.
