		<title>04HEALTH CARE IN BELLE VALE</title>
		<content>   Quite recently a health centre was  
 opened at the end of Hedgfield Road.  
 The facilites include a dentist &amp; an  
 optician.A lot of people from our     
 school go to the dentist there because
 it is so convenient for the people who
 live in the the Belle Vale area.Also  
 within the{health centre complex}is a 
 chiropodist &amp; a very good baby clinic 
 &amp; nursery.The local midwifes &amp; health 
 visitors use the centre as their base.
 There are six doctors &amp; if you want to
 make an appointment you only have to  
 make a phone call but failing this you
 may have to wait longer.Every family  
 has a particular doctor but if he is  
 off you are given any doctor who is   
 available.One disadvantage about the  
 health centre is that doctors have    
 moved from there original surgeries &amp; 
 may now be further away from their    
 patients.                             </content>
