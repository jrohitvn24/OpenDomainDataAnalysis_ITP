		<content> Twyning meadow and the adjoining      
 Summer Leasow lie beside the Avon.    
 Together they cover 260 acres and form
 one of the largest meadows in the     
 country. In the past many people had  
 rights there but now only eight own   
 the freehold meadow, presided over by 
 a head hay warden. Each has his own   
 patch of mowing grass and from the    
 12th August is allowed to graze first 
 cattle, then sheep. Most of these     
 pasture holders have rights to graze  
 neighbouring rough commons.           
 Brockeridge (188 acres), Showborough  
 and Hill End (22 acres)) and Lord Leys
 (37 acres). Only Brockeridge is fenced
 and a small number of cattle and sheep
 graze it. The principal occupants of  
 Showborough are long staying gypsies  
 who have 15 caravans, allthough a few 
 sheep are there. Five cottagers have  
 common rights but keep no stock there.</content>
