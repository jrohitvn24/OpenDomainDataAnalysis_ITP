		<content> The interaction of the clay,the glaze 
 and the firing temperature had to be  
 understood to be perfected and many   
 months of failure followed,each time  
 for a different reason.Being a purist 
 I also wanted my own glazes rather    
 than buy ready made colours.Test after
 test had to be made.In 1984 I decided 
 with trepidation to try to sell.      
 Gradually orders came in and I can now
 happily say that I am in business.    
 When I began I wanted to try          
 everything. I wanted to experience    
 everything that clay would do;        
 throwing,coiling,building from slabs, 
 and because there is so much to find  
 out I still feel the same excitement. 
 It will take me a lifetime - and that 
 is the wonder of it!
