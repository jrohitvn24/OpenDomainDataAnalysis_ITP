 We did a survey of employment among   
 the parents of the children at our    
 Primary School.  We found that most of
 the mothers of the children were      
 housewives or did part-time work in   
 offices or on the farm.               
                                       
 The males had a diversity of          
 occupations but the largest proportion
 were in jobs associated with          
 agriculture.  The next highest group  
 worked for the local authority, for   
 example, teaching.  None worked in    
 heavy industry.                       
                                       
 Only a very small percentage of those 
 who replied on the questionnaire said 
 they were unemployed.                 
                                       
                                       </content>
