		<title>04Dr.C.Irwin's Day</title>
		<content> The day begins at the stroke of mid-  
 night.It is the first of the night    
 calls.                                
 I put on my clothes,including a polo  
 neck sweater.I admit a holiday maker  
 to hospital with chest pains.         
 The next call is at 2.00 a.m.:an      
 allergic reaction to penicillin.I go  
 back to bed at 3.00 a.m.              
 I'm woken again at 7.00 and called to 
 the nearby village of Broadmayne.     
 Morning surgery begins at 8.45 a.m.   
 I see about twelve people, taking from
 five minutes up to thirty minutes each
 After surgery there are visits to     
 homes.                                
 Sometimes a visit could take most of  
 the day...babies being born at home   
 :or if someone very ill is going to   
 die,I go back several times during the
 day.This is not the most busy time I  
 remember.                             </content>
