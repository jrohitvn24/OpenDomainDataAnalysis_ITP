		<title>08BUCKHURST HAMLET</title>
		<content>   The hamlet is near to Buckhurst     
 Brow. The hamlet has now shrunk to 2  
 houses and a farm. One of the houses  
 used to be a school but this closed   
 down in the 1950's when many people   
 left to live in nearby towns. After   
 the school closed down it was         
 converted into a hen battery. It is   
 now a residential home run by Jim     
 Cleg.                                 
                                       
                                       
   Buckhust Farm was quite a large     
 farm when it was built in 1751. It was
 surrounded by 60 acres of grassland.  
 in winter 5 people work there and in  
 summmer 12.
