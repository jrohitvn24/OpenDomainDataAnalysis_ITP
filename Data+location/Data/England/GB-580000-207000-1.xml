		<title>01The Chelmer-Blackwater Vale</title>
		<content>    Our area covers the valley of      
 the River Chelmer,which joins with the
 River Blackwater at Beeleigh.The River
 Chelmer was made into a canal 200     
 years ago.It used to serve the farms  
 and two mills,that once worked at     
 Ulting and Langford,In our area.Now   
 it's barges have been converted into  
 floating restuarants which take       
 parties of people up and down the     
 river.Our area is mainly              
 farmland,although two gravel pits are 
 worked.There are two Hamlets on higher
 land above the flood plain of the     
 river:Langford and Ulting.One village 
 Woodham Walter is only part in our    
 area.The biggest single employer is   
 the Essex Water Company with it's     
 reservoir and pumping station at      
 Langford.
