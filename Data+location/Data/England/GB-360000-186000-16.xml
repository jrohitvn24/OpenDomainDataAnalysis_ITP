 surrounding villages. He orders some  
 5250 papers and 1000 comics and       
 magazines per week. The most popular  
 paper is the Daily Telegraph.         
 The busiest times of the day, in the  
 morning is about 8am when the children
 go to catch the school coach and      
 adults are going to work. Then in the 
 evening at about 4pm when the children
