		<title>12SANDON HALL FARM SANDON</title>
		<content>   There has been a farm on the land   
 since the 13th century. The present   
 farm has 410 acres. They have 333     
 sheep and 582 lambs. The sheep are    
 sheared in December and May. The      
 farmer thinks the sheep enjoy it and  
 the sheep are dipped three times a    
 year. They have two sheepdogs to help.
   As well as sheep, the farmer grows  
 wheat, barley, oats and rape. The farm
 buildings are used for storing corn   
 and housing animals. They have four   
 tractors, one combine harvester and   
 the other ploughs. They also have     
 chickens, ducks for their own use,    
 horses and a cat to chase away the    
 mice. To scare the birds, they use a  
 shotgun and a flare that sounds like a
 gun and they have a scarecrow.
