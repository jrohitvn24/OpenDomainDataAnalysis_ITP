		<title>10A Child's Saturday in Keyham</title>
		<content> On Saturday, 15th June, I got up at   
 6.30 am. I had cornflakes and a cup of
 tea for breakfast. At about 7.30 I    
 went to play basketball at my friend's
 house. I go to Leicester Karate Club  
 on Saturdays so at 9.00 my dad took us
 to Leicester. They went shopping and  
 picked me up at 11.30. My dad's car is
 a Ford Sierra Ghia (B reg). My younger
 brother was at home videoing{The      
{Saturday Picture Show}from the        
 television. We have a{Panasonic}video 
 recorder. We got home at 12.00 and I  
 watched what my brother had recorded  
 while mum prepared the hot-dogs for   
 our lunch. At 1.30 pm I went out to   
 play with my friend. My brother went  
 to  his friend's house. They played   
 teddy fights over the settee! I had   
 sandwiches for tea at 6.00 and after  
 watching{Jason and the Argonauts}on   
 television I went to bed at 10.00 pm. </content>
