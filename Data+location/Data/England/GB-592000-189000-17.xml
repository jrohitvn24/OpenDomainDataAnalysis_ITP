		<title>17PEOPLE'S LIKES AND DISLIKES</title>
		<content> The main things that people like about
 Barling are the countryside, the      
 peacefulness and the wild life. Most  
 people find it a friendly place to    
 live in. The main things that people  
 dislike about Barling are the heavy   
 lorries going to the pit. There have  
 been complaints of things falling off 
 the skip lorries. People feel that    
 they go too fast and damage the roads.
 Some people thought that the bus      
 service was poor. Others were worried 
 about the yacht club wanting to come  
 to the creek. This might mean more    
 cars going through the village.       
 Some people said that they did not    
 dislike any thing at all.
