		<content> The River Foss.                       
 We studied the River Foss from        
 Yearsley Bridge for 1/2 mile upstream.
 There were minnows,leeches and        
 tadpoles.There were also mallards and 
 water hens.Trees on the bank were     
 alder,willow,elder and birch.Smaller  
 plants were harebells,rose bay willow 
 herb and convolvulus.We took samples  
 of water and mud from the river.The   
 water showed no sign of polution.Mud  
 samples showed that sand and clay were
 present.We tested the depth of the    
 river.The deepest part of the channel 
 was about 80cms.The river is 6 metres 
 wide.We tested the speed of the river 
 by timing a piece of wood over 10     
 metres.The fastest time,near the weir,
 was 46 seconds.The slowest time,near  
 the bank,was 2 and a 1/2 minutes.
