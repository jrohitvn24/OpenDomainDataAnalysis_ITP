		<title>13All Saints Church Wimbish</title>
		<content> The original part of the church,the   
 nave,was built in the first half of   
 the 12th.century by the Fitzwalters of
 Wimbish Hall.The building has been    
 added to over the centuries and the   
 last major restoration was in the late
 1880's.In 1086 there were 2 priests   
 and 2 churches.Today there is 1 church
 &amp; a chapel but only 0.5 of a priest as
 the vicar is shared with another      
 parish.Church attendances these days  
 are small though regular services are 
 held.A Family Service is held on the  
 first Sunday of the month and on other
 Sundays there are services of Mattins 
 &amp; Communion.There is a club for       
 children under the age of eleven which
 is held on Tuesday evenings in        
 St.Pauls chapel.The Village Library   
 is  also here. At Christmas,Easter    
 &amp; Harvest time special services are   
 held when the church is then full.    </content>
