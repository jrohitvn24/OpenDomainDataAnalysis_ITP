		<title>17DARTMOUTH: A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>   My name is{Loretta.}I am 12 years   
 old and I live at 30 Churchfields.    
   It's{Monday}morning. I wake at 8    
 with the alarm, then change and have  
 cereal for breakfast.                 
   I leave for school at 8.35 and meet 
 my friends at the top of the estate by
 the{'No Entry'}sign. At school I meet 
 my best friend{Jennie}who lives in    
 Brixham. Our day at school is very    
 busy with lessons in English,         
 Humanities, Maths (my favourite), and 
 French (ahhh!). Jennie is staying the 
 night so we walk home together        
 exhausted.                            
   After tea we go to{"Good News Club" 
 followed by{Youth Club}where we sing, 
 and are learning to play the guitar.  
   Later my Dad takes us to{Dartmouth  
{Castle}at the mouth of the river.     
   I think Dartmouth is a pretty place.
