		<content> When I did my survey,{rounders and    
{hide and seek}were most popular. A lot
 of people liked rounders because it's 
{active and fun.}When I asked the top  
 class, a lot of the children liked the
 batting best and catching the ball.   
 Not many people liked to be fielders. 
 Hide and seek: the infant class liked 
 this best because it's fun to play and
 quite a lot of children liked seeking.
                                       
{This is how to play rounders:         
 When you set it up you have four posts
 set out in a square. When you've done 
 that, you have two teams; one fielding
 and one batting. When the batsman hits
 the ball he has to run around the     
 square of posts to score one rounder. 
 He can be got out by touching a post  
 before he gets there or by catching   
 the ball when he has hit it. When all 
 the team is out then the fielders bat.</content>
