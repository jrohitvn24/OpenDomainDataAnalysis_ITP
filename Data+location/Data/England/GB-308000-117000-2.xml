  There is only one Post Office in our 
 area.  The sub-postmistress is called 
 Mrs Burrows.  In our 12 squares there 
 are four post boxes.  When the postman
 delivers the letters it takes him five
 and a half hours to complete his      
 round.  There are four people who do  
 the Sampford Arundel round.  They take
 it in turns every week.  At Christmas 
 there are between 2,000 and 3,000     
 letters a week.  There is one         
 collection in the morning and one in  
 the afternoon.                        
            Telephone Exchange         
 Although Greenham is a small village  
 there is a Telephone Exchange.  A lot 
 of numbers are Greenham numbers in our
 area.  The longest Greenham number is 
 ten digits.  Some people in Sampford  
 have Greenham numbers.
