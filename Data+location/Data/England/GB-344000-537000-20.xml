		<title>20LIFE'S MOST IMPORTANT THINGS</title>
		<content> Our children were asked to indicate   
 the things they thought most important
 in life.  Understandably, they chose  
 such things as village life, farming  
 with all its machinery and livestock, 
 and power stations providing          
 electricity for family, community and 
 farming requirements.  In some ways   
 the choices made are surprising, in   
 that many of our children spend much  
 of their leisure time watching tele-  
 vision, with all that that medium in  
 1985 can interest a young person, by  
 way of goods, opportunities and wider 
 horizons.  Yet our children considered
 of greatest importance the things they
 knew well, in which they saw purpose  
 and a future.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
