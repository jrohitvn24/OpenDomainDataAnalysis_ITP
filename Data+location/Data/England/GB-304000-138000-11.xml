		<title>11Bungy Barnes of Yarde</title>
		<content>    {Bungy Barnes}came to{farm in}Yarde
 in 1931 when he married Eileen. He had
 160 acres which he farmed with two    
 workers increasing to four, Bungy     
 recalls that they were paid 30        
 shillings a week.                     
    It was a{mixed farm,}cattle,       
 poultry, pigs, sheep and crops. At    
 first the herd was a mixture but      
 became just{Pedigree Shorthorns. Up   
 until 1937 the milking was done by    
{hand, then electricity came to Yarde  
 so electric equipment was used. The   
 milk, in churns, was taken to the     
 collecting point at{Withycombe,}to go 
 on to{Minehead Dairy, first in the    
 back of his car, then on a trailer and
 later by lorry. For the first two     
 years on the farm Bungy was always up 
 by 4.30.a.m. to deliver the milk      
 between 6.00 and 7.00a.m.
