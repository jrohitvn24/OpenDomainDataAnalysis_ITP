		<title>04A farrowing unit</title>
		<content>The female pig (sow) produces her      
piglets 115 days after she has been    
serviced by the boar.In this particular
unit four sows were housed with an     
average of 10 piglets each.Each sow was
contained in a steel crate to prevent  
her rolling onto the tiny piglets while
they are feeding from her teats.Beside 
each crate was a creep-an area with a  
heat lamp keeping it warm-where the    
piglets could go to sleep.Soon after   
they were born they had their front    
teeth removed to protect the sow's     
teats.                                 
After three weeks the sow and her      
piglets were moved into a barn where   
the piglets began to feed on a mixture 
of oats,barley and wheat.              
When the piglets weigh about 75 kilos  
they are taken to Banbury Market and   
sold to other farmers for breeding or  
to butchers for bacon and sausages.    </content>
