		<content> Our block is in North Shropshire but  
 about one third of it is in Wales.    
 The Shropshire Union Canal is a major 
 feature. It runs right through our    
 block.                                
 In the east is the beginning of low   
 lying land known as "The Mosses", one 
 end is Wem Moss and the other end is  
 in Wales, Cadney Moss.                
 There are very main roads but a       
 honeycomb of country lanes and minor  
 roads.                                
 Four hamlets or villages make up our  
 block: Lyneal, Welshampton, Northwood 
 and Bettisfield.                      
 In Lyneal there is an avenue of trees 
 which dates back to the 1870's and was
 planted by the lady who built the     
 church.                               
 In Lyneal, we have a caravan site and 
 with the Shropshire Union Canal our   
 block gets alot of tourists.          </content>
