		<content>   There can be little doubt that      
 Wednesbury, Darlaston, Tipton has     
 suffered a downturn in recent years.  
   Many thousands of jobs have gone    
 from this block and unemployment      
 levels are high. Many young people now
 talk about having to leave the area   
 although most say they dont want to.  
   There is still a pride in being a   
 Black Country person which even young 
 people still speak of.                
   Some people stay optimistic and say 
 that with the large number of skilled 
 people available this area will be    
 able to meet the needs of a changing  
 world and be succesful again.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
