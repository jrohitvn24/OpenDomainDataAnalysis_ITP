		<content> I was interested to hear that your    
 class is taking part in the BBC       
 Domesday Project and wish you every   
 success.                              
 To answer your questions:             
 1. I have been the Member of          
 Parliament for Poole since May 1979.  
 2. One great change will take place in
 Poole if the exploration for oil in   
 Poole Harbour is successful.  We shall
 then have a large oilfield in the     
 harbour area.  The country needs the  
 oil and it will create more jobs in   
 this area, but we must make sure that 
 no damage is done either to the local 
 environment or to the traditional     
 industries, such as fishing, boating  
 and water sports.  B.P. now have      
 permission to drill four exploratory  
 wells on Furzey Island, and they have 
 promised to make the house and gardens
 on the island available for local use.</content>
