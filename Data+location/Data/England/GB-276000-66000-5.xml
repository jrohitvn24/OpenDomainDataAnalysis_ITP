		<content> At present the{farmers}pay Â£32 per    
 year per acre for the land which they 
 lease, and a negotiated rent for      
 buildings.                            
      Entry to the European Economic   
 Community has meant the introduction  
 of many restrictions on production at 
 every farm.The Ministry of Agriculture
 sends inspectors to make sure that the
 laws are obeyed.One such rule is that 
 no farmer may sell or give away       
 unpasteurized{milk}for consumption by 
 anyone other than his own family.     
       The{labourers}on the farm number
  from 1 to 6 usually in proportion to 
 the size of the farmers family.They   
 are paid a basic wage about Â£90 per   
 week.                                 
      The powerful{tractors}with all   
 kinds of sophisticated add-ons can    
 easily cope with all the farm work.
