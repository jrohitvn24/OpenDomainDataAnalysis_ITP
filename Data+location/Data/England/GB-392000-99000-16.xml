		<content> MANY FUELS ARE USED HERE TO MAKE      
 ENERGY.WE HAVE A BIG OIL TANK OUTSIDE 
 THE SCHOOL BUILDING.THE OIL IS PUMPED 
 TO A BOILER WHICH HEATS WATER WHICH IS
 PUMPED ALL AROUND THE SCHOOL.MANY     
 HOUSES HAVE THE SAME KIND OF CENTRAL  
 HEATING SYSTEM.OTHERS ARE HEATED IN   
 THE SAME WAY BUT INSTEAD OF USING OIL 
 FOR THE FIRE THEY BURN GAS.THE GAS    
 COMES THROUGH UNDERGROUND PIPES TO THE
 HOUSES.MANY FAMILIES HAVE GAS FIRES IN
 THEIR ROOMS INSTEAD OF CENTRAL HEATING
 AND MANY COOK THEIR FOOD ON GAS       
 COOKERS.THE OLDEST FUEL HERE MUST HAVE
 BEEN WOOD AND SOME HOMES STILL HAVE   
 WOOD BURNING STOVES WHILE MANY OTHERS 
 HAVE COAL AND COKE FIRES.ALL THE      
 HOMES I KNOW OF HAVE ELECTRICITY TO   
 GIVE LIGHT.SOME USE IT FOR HEAT       
 THROUGH NIGHT STORAGE HEATERS OR      
 ELECTRIC FIRES.
