		<content> In a pleasant wooded area full of     
 birds and animals is a sewage         
 works.Sid, Roy and Len work there and 
 told us about the works. The rather   
 out of date plant collects sewage from
 south of Billericay.It gravitates     
 through pipes into a screen which     
 removes bulky materials. The sewage   
 flows into settlement tanks where the 
 solids settle to the bottom and       
 cleaner water laps over the top       
 through more pipes,into the spinklers.
 Water pours through holes in pipes.As 
 these rotate,the water goes through   
 circular clinker beds.Clinker is      
 porous and like a hard sponge. As     
 water seeps through,the bacteria in   
 cavities feed on impurities in the    
 effluent.Next it filters through sand 
 beds which finally "polish"the water. 
 From  settlement tanks it goes to the 
 river.                                </content>
