		<title>05Lace Maker, Houghton</title>
		<content> The Houghton lace maker and has been  
 teaching for 13 years. She first went 
 to learn the craft when she was 12.   
 She produces trinket boxes, brooches, 
 hankies and various gifts. The lace is
 made using bobbins. Each thread       
 is held by a seperate bobbin. A       
 pattern is used called a pricking     
 which has tiny prick holes marked on  
 it. The design is created by weaving  
 the bobbins through the pins and for  
 complicated patterns as many as 200   
 bobbins are used. The different kinds 
 of bobbins are glass, wood, bone and  
 plastic. Hanging bobbins bear the     
 names of people who were hanged in the
 1800s. She prefers to use natural     
 threads e.g. linen and silk, since    
 synthetic threads are not suitable for
 lace making. It takes about an hour to
 make a square inch of fine lace. She  
 usually works for two hours a day.    </content>
