		<title>09BUS SERVICES FROM WORKSOP</title>
		<content>    There are 25 bus routes from       
 Worksop including school buses. They  
 go East to Gainsborough, North to     
 Doncaster, South to Nottingham and    
 West to Chesterfield. Some services   
 run buses every 15 minutes, some every
 two hours and some only once or twice 
 a week.                               
    Most buses are operated by a       
 driver who also collects the fares.   
    Fares are worked out on mileage. It
 is about 40-50 pence for five miles   
 for an adult and half-price for       
 children aged five to fifteen. Dogs   
 are also half-price. The highest fare 
 is Â£2.50p return. The company takes   
 between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000 per day in  
 fares.
