		<title>04LOCAL HISTORY - HEDINGHAM</title>
		<content>   There is a mention of Castle        
 Hedingham in the original Domesday    
 Book.                                 
   This was a busy and prosperous place
 in the middle ages and into the 17th  
 c. when it was a market town, but it  
 is now a quiet village with many      
 buildings (Listed) from the past in a 
 very good state of preservation.      
 Hedingham Castle was built by Aubrey  
 de Vere about 1140, but the Keep is   
 all that now remains. The de Veres    
 became the Earls of Oxford and        
 remained in the village until 1625.   
 They built St. Nicholas Parish Church,
 and the Nunnery, now a private        
 farm, which was founded for           
 Black-veiled nuns in 1190.            
   Woollen cloth was produced until the
 early 19th c.                         
   Hedingham pottery was produced here 
 in the 19th c. by Edward Bingham.     </content>
