{Sherburn.}A new private estate by     
 Persimmon Homes is being built on the 
 eastern side of Low Street.Additional 
 homes are also to be built off        
 Croftway.Planning permission has been 
 granted for 475 homes to be built in  
 fields behind Qualter's. Access to    
 these homes will be through Cardinal  
 Close and through the Persimmon       
 estate.The population of Sherburn is  
 expected to rise to 5,536 by 1991.The 
 in-fill policy of housing as stated in
 the North Yorkshire county plan can be
 seen to be followed in the residential
 development in Sherburn.The village   
 has expanded rapidly during recent    
 years due to the development of the   
 Selby Coalfield and the expansion of  
 the Enterprise Park Trading Estate on 
 Moor Lane.
