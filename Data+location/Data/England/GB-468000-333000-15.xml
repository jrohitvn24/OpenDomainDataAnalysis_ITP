		<title>15Colston Bassett, Part Three.</title>
		<content> The Colston Bassett Creamery produces 
 100 cheeses a day taking 1700 gals of 
 milk. The cheeses, weighing approx. 14
 1bs., win many prizes and are exported
 abroad.                               
    From the village we can see Belvoir
 Castle.  This is excellent fox-hunting
 country with many hedges. The Belvoir 
 Hunt meet here and the Quorn and      
 South Notts Hunts ride through.       
 We often see Prince Charles hunting.  
   The Hall overlooks the Park and     
 dominates the village. It is now      
 privately owned and the grounds have  
 been developed.                       
   The mobile library van calls weekly 
 and there is a weekly bus to Bingham  
 Market. The large Parish Church of    
 St.John the Divine is in the Wiverton 
 Group and has a service every Sunday. 
 The bell-ringers come to use the full 
 peal of bells ,recently restored.     </content>
