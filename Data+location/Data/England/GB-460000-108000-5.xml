		<title>05The Priory, Southwick</title>
		<content> The remains of the Priory buildings   
 are to be seen to the south west of   
 Southwick House. As the site of the   
 Priory has never been excavated, we   
 know nothing about the Priory Church  
 and what remains above ground appears 
 to be part of the Refectory. The      
 Parish Church of Southwick            
{"St James-outside-the-Priory-Gate"    
 contains windows and carved stones    
 removed from the Priory Church after  
 the Reformation.                      
 The destruction of the Priory was due 
 to the break with the Catholic Church 
 and the establishment of Henry        
 VIII-who had visited the shrine of    
 "Our Lady of Southwick" and made an   
 offering in 1510 of 6s 8d- as Head of 
 the English Church, the possesions of 
 the Priory were granted to John White 
 in 1539.                              
                                       </content>
