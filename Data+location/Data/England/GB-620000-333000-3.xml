		<content>Although under cultivation,Gunton Park 
today is much as the landscape         
artist of the 19th century planned.The 
principal Hanworth entrance built by   
Samuel Wyatt,the imposing Tower        
entrance to the east (Gilpin 1820),    
Elderton Lodge,now a hotel and         
Suffield Lodge have been restored to   
their origanal style,as have smaller   
lodges and cottages. Though sold or    
let most of the buildings within the   
park are listed as of architectural and
historical importance -Grade 2.The park
is designated  a conservation area in  
the County Plan.                       
   The 2 lakes and informal parkland   
gardens designed by Bridgman, Repton   
and Capability Brown, all surrounded   
by  a belt of mixed woodland make      
Gunton Park an area of great natural   
beauty abounding in wild life..
