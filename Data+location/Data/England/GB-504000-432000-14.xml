		<title>14New Village in Cottingham</title>
		<content> My school, Danepark Junior High, made 
 a survey of square number 6 in the    
 block. This is what we found.         
 The area is part of the New Village in
 Cottingham. Most of the land is       
 covered by nurseries and cultivated   
 land, although there is quite a lot of
 derelict land.{Plans to use some of   
{this for a BMX track have been        
{shelved.}Housing is typical of most   
 old villages but we found some large  
 modern detached houses and older      
 cottages, some over 120 years old, and
 rows of terraced houses of the early  
 1920s.  There were many semi-detached 
 houses between 10 and 80 years old.   
 The area looks prosperous; many people
 have their own cars which makes up for
 the infrequent bus services, one an   
 hour. New Village is poorly endowed   
 with shops, having only five,         
 including a hair fashion shop.        </content>
