		<title>16BUSINESS FAIRLIGHT, E.SUSSEX</title>
		<content> Each of the three village centres     
 Fairlight, Guestling, Pett in East    
 Sussex have small general stores to   
 provide groceries, toiletries and     
 hardware for the villagers.   Many    
 people travel to Hastings for their   
 weekly supply of groceries.  For      
 clothes, furniture, electrical goods, 
 etc. all villagers have to go to      
 Hastings or Rye, or further.          
                                       
 There are a few small businesses here.
 There is one firm of building         
 decorators and funeral directors. A   
 bricklayer, and a painter and         
 decorator can also be found in this   
 area.  There are two small businesses 
 not directly connected with serving   
 the needs of the villagers.  These are
 a lubricating equipment manufacturer  
 and a firm making moulds for          
 glassfibre reinforced plastics.       </content>
