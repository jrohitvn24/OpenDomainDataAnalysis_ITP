		<title>20     SIR ROBERT PEEL</title>
		<content> Robert Peel was born at Chamber Hall, 
 Bury the son of a cotton magnate. At  
 21 he became Member of Parliament for 
 Tamworth. During his political career 
 he formed the Metropolitan Police in  
 1829. These men became known as       
 "Bobbies" or "Peelers" after his name.
 He became Prime Minister in 1834 and  
 1841 at the head of a Conservative    
 government. He built up the party into
 a major political force. His greatest 
 achievement as far as the public was  
 concerned was the abolition of the    
 Corn Laws in 1846 which helped Britain
 on the road to Free Trade.He died in  
 1850 following a riding accident.     
 In his honour a tower was erected     
 after public subscription on Holcombe 
 Hill which overlooks the entire       
 Metropolitan Borough. Also a statue   
 stands in Market Place opposite the   
 Parish Church where he was baptised.  </content>
