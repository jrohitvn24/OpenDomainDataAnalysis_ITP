		<content>    Some children in our class talked  
 to one of our dinner ladies who has   
 lived in{Church Stretton}all her life.
 She told us about how it}has changed  
 over the last{50{years.               
    It has grown a lot. There are now  
 a lot more houses and people and there
 are now two schools. There used to be 
 one main school but there were a few  
 private schools as well.              
    There used to be a{cinema}but now  
 it is a shop called Spar.             
    There were not any houses in{      
 Lutwyche Road, Central Avenue and     
 Brooksbury but there are now.         
    The Fire Station used to be at{    
 Beaumont Court but now it is in {     
 Sandford Avenue.                      
    There only used to be a few cars   
 but now there are a lot.
