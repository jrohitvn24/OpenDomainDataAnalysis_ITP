 Hykeham is only 2 miles from the      
 beautiful cathedral city of Lincoln.  
 But you don't need to go to the town  
 centre to shop,in this area you can go
 to a super store,shopping precinct    
 within 1 mile.Where ever you are you  
 are not far from a very nice shop or  
 playing area,there are no factories in
 this area until you have driven a good
 few miles.For aeroplane buffs only 10 
 min drive away are R.A.F Swinderby,or 
 R.A.F Waddington.20 minutes away is   
 R.A.F.Scampton, base of the{RED       
{ARROWS}display team,and 25 minutes    
 drive away is R.A.F.Cranwell.This area
 is residential with 2 or 3 hotels on  
 the A46.You've probably heard about   
 sunsets in Japan and Cape Sunion in   
 Greece,but I would suggest you think  
 of this area as one of their rivals!
