		<title>04Modern day farming</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mrs. Speed at Beer Hall
 Farm. She told us about modern        
 farming. Nowadays they use tractors   
 and ploughs and have a lorry coming   
 every day to collect the milk and take
 it away.In the olden days the farmer  
 would milk the cows by hand, rather   
 than machinery, put it into churns and
 take the churns to the nearest village
 to sell. Now the cows are milked by   
 machines and the milk goes into jars, 
 then a  big milk lorry comes to the   
 farm to collect the milk. The milk is 
 taken to a bottling depot and then    
 delivered to us by the milkman.       
 Mr and Mrs Perry also have mainly     
 grazing land on which they keep mainly
 cows but also a few sheep. The cows   
 are Friesians and have a milk yield of
 about 1000 gallons per cow per year.
