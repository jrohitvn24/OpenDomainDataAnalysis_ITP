 half past seven,slowly I climbed out  
 of bed. After letting our cat in I    
 woke Tom,then we both descended the

 dad had got up we had breakfast it was

 bacon and sausages but it was tasty.  
 After breakfast dad and I went to pull
 up weeds in the garden while mum and  
 Tom did some baking. Dad and I worked

 was lunch time we had a salad. After  
 lunch mum made a picnic. Then we went 
 to the lake near the manor Tom and I  
 rode our bikes, I left my bike hidden

 calling for me.I giggled I thought if </content>
