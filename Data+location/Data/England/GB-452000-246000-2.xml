		<title>02CULWORTH VILLAGE</title>
		<content>Most of the old houses in Culworth are 
built of local stone obtained from     
nearby quarries of sandstone,limestone,
and ironstone.There is also Byfield    
blackstone used for flooring.There are 
thirty dwellings dating from C17 &amp; C18.
       More recently seventeen new     
houses have been built during the      
second half of the twentieth century.  
       One cottage called Old Walls is 
the only building to still have a      
thatched roof.One house is in the      
process of being built by its owner    
Mr Kilmister,a Banbury policeman.      
       There are twenty six buildings  
listed as being of historic interest in
the village plus headstones and        
memorials in the churchyard. Also      
listed is Culworth Mill just outside   
the village,believed to stand on the   
site of the mill mentioned in the      
original Domesday Book.                </content>
