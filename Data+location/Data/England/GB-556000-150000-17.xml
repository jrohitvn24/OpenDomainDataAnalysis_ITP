		<content> Once Dene Park was a big estate owned 
 by John Hollom it included 682 acres  
 of land,out buildings,stables and a   
 farm.Since then the estate has been   
 split up.John Hollom did many things  
 to make the building look old he had  
 an oak fire place built with 1591 on  
 it.Dene Park is no longer a private   
 house it is a residential college for 
 spastic teenagers.There are 50        
 students of 16-19 all of them are both
 mentally and physically handicapped.  
 The college has special equipment for 
 these students,such as electric       
 wheelchairs and computers which have  
 easy programmes.                      
 All students in the college own       
 animals, such as rabbits,fish and     
 birds,so that they can experience     
 responsibility.
