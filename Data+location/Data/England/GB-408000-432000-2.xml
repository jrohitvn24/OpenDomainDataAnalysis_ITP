		<content>   In our area the main use of land was
 for farming, mainly grazing.The second
 major use of land was for housing.    
 There was only one estate{(Ash Tree   
{Ave.)}.There were only two sources of 
 employment the{International Meat     
{Factory}and{Simmonites Land Rover     
{Garage}.                              
  A woman we interviewed said the buses
 were not frequent after peak hours,and
 said that there was only The White    
 Horse Inn for entertainment.There was 
 a disused railway line going through a
 tunnel to Denholme and under the main 
 road leading to Clayton.
