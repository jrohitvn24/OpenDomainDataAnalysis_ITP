		<title>03ST.MARY'S CHURCH CAPEL</title>
		<content>   St.Mary's church was begun in the   
 early 12th century. The porch was     
 added in the 14th century. At that    
 time the original chancel arch was    
 removed and the present, unique, rood 
 screen of three arches, with one above
 to accommodate the rood loft, was     
 built.One Norman window with a fresco 
 painting has survived and a triangular
 window, put in to light the rood loft.
   When the village 'moved' to either  
 side of the A20,St. Radigund's church 
 was built in the centre of the        
 village. Today St. Mary's is only used
 for weddings, baptisms and funerals   
 and is soon to be taken over by the   
 Redundant Churches Fund. This means   
 that although it will no longer be    
 used as a church, it will be cared for
 and maintained and the rood screen and
 other unusual features will be saved.
