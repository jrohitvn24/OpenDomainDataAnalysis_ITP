		<title>02WILDLIFE IN RODHUISH.</title>
		<content> The open countryside is full of many  
 animals of all shapes and sizes. At   
 different times of the year well known
 animals can be easily seen in the     
 wild. The most common and easily      
 spotted animals are rabbits, pheasants
 and magpies as well an endless variety
 of small birds.                       
 A patient watcher could spot and track
 deer, badgers and foxes. None of these
 are liked by the farmers as they come 
 down from the hills and destroy crops 
 or frighten small livestock.          
 Both the deer and the fox are hunted  
 across the Brendon Hills. Badgers are 
 thought to live closer to the farms   
 and the villages. They are suspected  
 of spreading the rubbish from the     
 black sacks before the dustmen collect
 them. On a sunny day a wide variety of
 butterflies can be seen drinking from 
 the many wild flowers.                </content>
