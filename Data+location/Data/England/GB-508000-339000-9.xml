		<content>    According to a survey which we have
 carried out a lot of people like      
 outdoor hobbies.Fishing seems to be   
 one of the popular ones and we can    
 catch pike perch and roach nearby and 
 dace cub and carp in waters further   
 afield. Other people seem to like     
 walking, (our area is very rural)     
 and gardening is a popular leisure    
 activity.                             
    A lot of people enjoy swimming and 
 there is a swimming pool 4 miles away 
 in Sleaford.There are several indoor  
 hobbies which are poular , including  
 knitting, sewing, winemaking and      
 reading.Television and videos are also
 popular leisure activities.           
    Many people use the village hall   
 where clubs are organised including   
 Bingo, Sports Club, coffee mornings   
 and Disco's. Coach outings are also   
 organised by local groups.            </content>
