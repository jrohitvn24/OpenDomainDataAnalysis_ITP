		<content> At about 1.30 I go in for my          
 dinner.Sometimes I have fish, chips   
 and mushy peas.After dinner I meet    
 Robert Watkinson and Matthew Sas and  
 we go swimming.We enjoy swimming and  
 football because they are good        
 sports.We make sure we get to the pool
 in time for aqua-fun.Last week they   
 had a "blue thing"out. It stretched   
 from one end of the pool to the other.
 We got on it and a man told us to get 
 in a straight line and hold each      
 others feet.He pulled me by my arm and
 we all went along together.           
 After we come out it is about 5       
 o'clock and we always walk round Clay 
 Cross market for half an hour.At 5.30 
 we catch the bus back to N.Wingfield  
 Green.I leave them here because I walk
 up{the perry}(short cut-wasteland)to  
 get home.  Jon Needham aged 11.
