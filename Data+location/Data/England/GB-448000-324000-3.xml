		<content>{Kegworths}first{school,}the{Queen     
{Elizabeth School,}was built in the    
 late 15 hundreds on{Nottingham Road   
 and run by the church. It is now a    
 cottage called Harrison house,named   
 after the Harrison family. The old    
{school}house on{Dragwell}is 142 years 
 old and the children used slate and   
 chalk to write on.In 1939 the children
 in the old{school}moved to the present
{school}on{High Street,}this was built 
 on the site of an old farm. In 1955   
 the playing field was added and in    
 1968 an infant block was built making 
 a total of 10 classes. The present    
 headmaster,{Mr Westhead,}came to the  
{school}in 1960.In 1975 an outdoor pool
 was built. The{school roll}of some    
 200 children  aged from 4 to 10 has   
 fallen over the last 9 years but at   
 the moment seems to be rising again   
 due to new house building.            </content>
