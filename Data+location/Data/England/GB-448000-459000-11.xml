		<content> The villages were once inhabited      
 mainly by agricultural workers.The    
 coming of the R.A.F.to Linton-on-Ouse,
 farm mechanisation and the sale of    
 Beningbrough Hall Estate has changed  
 both Linton and Newton.The R.A.F.has  
 provided local employment. Some       
 people,especially men,work for Airwork
 Ltd.,civilian contractors to the      
 R.A.F.Few people work on the local    
 farms and many commute to York and    
 other places of employment.Among these
 are Social Service workers, police,   
 teachers, architects and professional 
 people. A number of people are        
 self-employed and include a coal      
 retailer,joiner, builders,painter and 
 decorator, undertaker,dressmaker, shop
 keepers,garage proprietor, publicans  
 and farmers .All at Widdington are    
 connected with farming. Unemployment  
 is small and mostly seasonal.         </content>
