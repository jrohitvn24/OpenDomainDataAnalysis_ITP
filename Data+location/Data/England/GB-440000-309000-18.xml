		<title>18ST DENYS CHURCH, IBSTOCK</title>
		<content>    The last decade has seen extensive 
 restoration to{St. Denys Parish       
{Church, Ibstock.}                     
    In 1976 a new floor was laid and   
 thefts of lead from the church roof in
 the late seventies made it necessary  
 for a new roof to be installed.       
    Replacement windows have been      
 fitted and these have incorporated    
 copies of ancient stained-glass coats 
 of arms, including the ecclesiastical 
 coats of arms of Archbishop Laud, a   
 former rector.                        
    One of the more interesting changes
 brought about by the present rector,  
 the Rev. Derek Buxton, has been the   
 unblocking of a window on the south   
 side of the altar which Archbishop    
 Laud ordered to be concealed in 1618. 
 Whitewash from the 1500's was still on
 some of the ancient stones within the 
 wall.                                 </content>
