		<title>05STAINES BOWLS CLUB</title>
		<content>{ Staines Bowls Club}started in        
 1920.The first President was Mr.Fox   
 Warren who was on the board of Ashby's
 Brewery(now Courages).He and others   
 put up the money for the first green  
 to be built near Tothill Street       
 opposite the Pack Horse Hotel.The Club
 played there until the Council decided
 to build a road behind Staines High   
 Street and all existing premises were 
 purchased with a view to building     
 South Street and the new shopping     
 centre.                               
  The Club moved first to a Council    
 green at Fordbridge Park and then to  
 the green at Knowle Green where the   
 Club now has it's home.
