		<title>10HINDU DAY</title>
		<content> I wake up sleepy, I read a comic.     
 Then I go downstairs.  Most of the    
 time I don't have my breakfast because
 I'm going to be late for school.      
 I call for my friend's David and      
 Shabier and Shabier's brother.  Then  
 I go to the shops.  After that I go to
 school.                               
 After school I meet my friends and go 
 to the temple.  I come back at 7:15.  
 Then we go shopping.  I like to get   
 sweets, pop, cake, crisps and comics. 
 When I get home we watch a video.  In 
 the middle of the film I go upstairs  
 and read a comic.  When I am tired I  
 go to sleep.                          
 At school my favourite subject is     
 computers.  The worst subject is      
 Mental Arithmetic.  When I go to the  
 Temple I learn Punjabi.  I wear       
 ordinary clothes.  Only Hindu's are   
 allowed but I go to learn or have fun.</content>
