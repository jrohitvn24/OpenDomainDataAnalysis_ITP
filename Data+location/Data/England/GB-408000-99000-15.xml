		<title>15RECREATION CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content> There are many games which most       
 children play both at home and at     
 school, especially the game of{'It'.  
 To play 'It' is fairly easy and any   
 number of children can join in. You   
 have a chaser and all the rest of the 
 children have to be chased. Whoever is
 caught becomes the chaser.            
{Tennis}is very popular too. It can be 
 for two (singles) or four (doubles)   
 players. They each have a racket      
 and try to hit the tennis ball back   
 and forth over a net stretched across 
 the middle of the court. Points are   
 scored - 15, 30, 40. If a player hits 
 the ball outside the boundary lines, a
 point goes to the other player, also  
 if it goes into the net or bounces    
 twice. We have tennis courts at school
 where we can play one day a week      
 during play time. We will learn       
 properly when we are older.           </content>
