		<title>02LONGFORD HALL</title>
		<content>    Longford Hall was built around the 
 fourteenth century. Longford Hall is  
 very interesting. The Longford family 
 were the first people to live in the  
 Hall. The last of the family died in  
 1620. After that the Hall was owned by
 the descendants of Sir Edward         
 Coke. The Coke family no longer own   
 the Hall.                             
    Longford Hall was burned down in   
 1942. Then it was built again in 1949.
 It took seven years to rebuild. It was
 built just as it was in 1560.         
    There are nine chimneys on the Hall
 roof. There are two big gates at the  
 Hall. Robert Bakewell made them.      
    It is now the private home of a    
 business man.
