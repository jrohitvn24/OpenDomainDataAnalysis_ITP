{NORTH NORFOLK HOLIDAY HOMES.          
 This part of North Norfolk is truly   
 "seaside", and attracts holiday makers
 for weekend and Annual holidays.Many  
 of them hire caravans and many others 
 own their own, and the sites' owners  
 charge a high fee, or a rental        
 accordingly. This sort of holiday is  
 very popular, and there are many      
 caravan sites in this area. They are  
 mostly well run, with the proprietor  
 or a warden, on-site. They have good  
 amenities - Showers, Lavatories,      
 shops, clubs , and childrens' play    
 areas. The caravans nowadays have     
 mains electricity for lighting. Some  
 are quite luxurious.
