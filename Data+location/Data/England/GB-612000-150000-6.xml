		<content>     This layman's view of the wildlife
 in the area is based on observations  
 gathered while walking the area since 
 1980. The area is used intensively for
 agriculture and it is evident that    
 this has an impact on the flora and   
 fauna. Many hedges have been grubbed  
 and field margins are sprayed with    
 chemicals necessary for modern methods
 of farming.It is not unusual to see   
 chemically damaged specimens of       
 flowers in the field edges, primroses 
 and violets in Spring and poppies in  
 summer for example. However much of   
 beauty survives often in woodland     
 areas. Cowslips are still in a few    
 places and when found with primroses  
 ox slips may occur. Various orchids   
 may be discovered, particularly in    
 woodland, and bluebells smother the   
 woodland floor in spring. Poppies     
 brighten the summer fields.           </content>
