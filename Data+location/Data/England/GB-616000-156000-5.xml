		<content> There is irregular spacing between    
 trees and enormous old trees which    
 would have been cut long ago in a     
 commercial wood.                      
 The coppice woodland is mainly        
 associated with poor quality acid     
 soils(pH 5-6) based on terraced       
 gravels.  The area is immediately     
 south-east of the River Stour.        
 At the time of the survey many plants 
 could be seen including anenomies,    
 primroses and red campion.  Vast      
 numbers of insects such as butterflies
 and beetles could also be observed,   
 especially in Trenleypark wood.       
  The amount of land used for coppicing
 has significantly declined in recent  
 years. In the area surveyed, the      
 demand for timber has been reduced to 
 the extent that 17% of the land is    
 being converted to agricultural use.
