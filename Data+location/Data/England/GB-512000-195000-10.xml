		<content> Bushey Hall Farm is locat4d on swuare 
 05120197. The present early 18th      
 Century farmhouse occupies the site of
 Bushey's earliest manor house which   
 was recorded in the original Domesday 
 Survey. It was a moated manor and the 
 depression occupied by the moat is    
 marked on the Ordnance Survey map of  
 the area. During the 15th Century     
 another manor was built on the site   
 by the Earl of Salisbury. This was    
 destroyed during the 17th Century.    
 The present farm has a dairy herd,    
 market gardening and runs a farm shop 
 serving the local community.
