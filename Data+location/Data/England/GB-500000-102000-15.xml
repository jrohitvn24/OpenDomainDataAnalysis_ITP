		<content> Littlehampton Harbour was a major     
 shipbuilding port in the 19th century 
 specialising in the building of wooden
 ships.                                
 The ships built in the harbour in the 
 19th century were the Ketch,Brig and  
 Barque-the largest being the Barque   
 and the smallest the Ketch.           
 The river in the harbour was called   
 the Arundel River which cut through   
 the Chalk Downs and flowed towards    
 Horsham.                              
 The River Arun is constantly silted up
 with sand and mud flowing down the    
 river,so every so often it is dredged 
 to clear it.                          
 Famous names associated with          
 Littlehampton Harbour were Corney     
 &amp; Carver,Thomas Isemonger and Stephen 
 Olliver.With the help of these people 
 the harbour flourished.
