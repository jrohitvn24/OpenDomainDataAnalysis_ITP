		<content> On the farm their breed of cows are   
 Friesians from Holland which are black
 and white and produce a lot of milk.  
 They have one Friesian bull on the    
 farm but it is only a calf also they  
 have a Gurnsey calf which is only a   
 pet but when it is older they are     
 hoping to put it on show. An avarge   
 cow would cost about Â£500 at market. A
 female dairy cow needs a calf each    
 year before it can give milk. At birth
 the calf is taken away from its       
 mother, hand fed brought up in a pen.
