		<content>{Blackburn Rovers}were formed in       
 November 1874 and are the 5th oldest  
 club in the football league. The club 
 itself as won the{F.A. Cup}six times, 
 and they won it three times on the    
 run, and became first division        
 champions in 1911, 1912, 1913. In 1960
 at Wembley, they were beaten{3:0}by   
{Wolverhampton Wanderers}in the        
 FA cup final, after being reduced to  
 ten men when David Whelan broke his   
 leg. Substitues were not allowed in   
 those days. Their biggest ever cup    
 victory, was in beating Sheffield     
 Wednesday{8:1}in 1890. They are one of
 the few clubs to have won{first,      
{second and third division             
{championship trophies.}They are still 
 one of the few clubs to still play in 
 their original strip of blue and white
 halves.
