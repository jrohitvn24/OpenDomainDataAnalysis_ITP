		<content>Sywell people spend some of their      
leisure time at the local pub and motel
but many prefer sporting activities:   
football, cricket, squash, tennis, golf
shooting (at the Range), sailing at the
nearby reservoir and fishing. Keep     
Fit and Yoga classes are held at the   
local primary school. Flower arranging 
is also taught at evening classes at   
the school. Other adults attend classes
at Nene College and Moulton            
Comprehensive School.                  
Most people in Sywell enjoy at least   
one holiday a year. Many travel abroad:
by car to the Continent, by plane to   
the Mediterranean and the odd person to
U.S.A. and Canada. Caravanning and     
camping are popular both in this       
country and abroad. As most people have
cars, this is the most usual form of   
transport. Coach and train travel to   
London is common.                      </content>
