  On one of the windows in the main    
part of St. James the Apostle Church   
was a stained glass picture of an      
aeroplane. This was very colourful.    
Underneath was written the words :-    
  "This window is dedicated before God 
in remembrance of those who gave their 
lives for freedom during World War II  
while serving at Grafton Underwood     
1943-45; especially those memories of  
the 384th bomb group (H) The United    
States 8th Air Force. - Coming Home !" 
  This is linked with the memorial     
statue mentioned on Page 12.           
  At the back of the church are books  
for sale and a visitors book dating    
from 1928, containing interesting      
comments from people all over Britain  
and North America.
