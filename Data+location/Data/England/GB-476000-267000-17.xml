		<content>    Mrs.Kay says that the people in the
 community tend to use the village shop
 only for small purchases.It can offer 
 only a very limited range of groceries
 and these tend to be expensive. Since 
 everyone has access to a car,they much
 prefer to make the journey into       
 Northampton for food and supplies.    
    In winter, when the area has few   
 visitors, Mrs.Kay enjoys a walk along 
 the deserted reservoir bank. She      
 recalled the recent{protests}from     
 local people when the water authority 
 proposed to create a leisure park and 
 cycle track around Pitsford Water. She
 is pleased that the villagers were    
 successful in opposing the scheme.    
    The area has such a{low population 
 that a former neighbour was able to   
 use the field next to his house as a  
 landing strip for his privately owned 
 light aircraft!                       </content>
