		<content> Pliocene marine formation at St.Erth. 
      In places the moulding-sand is   
 capped with clay, and in l88l, when   
 the clay was being worked as a        
 puddling-clay, marine fossils were    
 discovered in it.  Since then many    
 collectors have visited the deposits, 
 a number of papers have been          
 published,and a general consensus has 
 emerged that the clay is Pliocene in  
 age.  The clay in turn is capped with 
 a layer of solifluction-earth or head.
      The first scientific paper to    
 describe the clay as 'a tough boulder 
 clay, with marine shells' was in l882 
 and it has been investigated several  
 times the most recent being l973 by   
 G.F.Mitchell on behalf of the Royal   
 Society.
