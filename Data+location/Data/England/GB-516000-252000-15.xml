		<title>15French Kier Construction</title>
		<content> In 1967 the company now renamed French
 Kier moved its headquaters to         
 Tempsford Bedfordshire in the grounds 
 of the old manor  house.The main      
 reason for this move was economical   
 Tempsford rates being much cheaper    
 than London,plus the sight was by the 
 side of the A1 trunk road so London   
 was less than an hours drive away.    
 Today the company is one of the major 
 employers in the area. It has         
 developed a high reputation in        
 building bridges, large jetties,and   
 multi storey car parks.  The famous   
 blue square {FK}symbol is a common    
 sight today and it is this sign which 
 first catches the eye as you enter    
 Tempsford Hall grounds,perhaps an     
 unlikely home for a great Empire      
 builder.
