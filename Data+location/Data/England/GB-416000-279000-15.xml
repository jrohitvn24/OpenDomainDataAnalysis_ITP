		<title>15A WALK ALONG HENWOOD LANE</title>
		<content>  The tree and hedge lined road        
 meanders towards the junction with    
 Berry Hall Lane. On a high wall is the
 notice 'Smallpox Keep Out'. This is   
 the outer wall of the Isolation       
 Hospital. We cross over the Grand     
 Union Canal by way of an old bridge   
 and onto the ford where the road      
 crosses the River Blythe. A wooden    
 footbridge runs alongside the road.   
 Here can be found the disused Henwood 
 Flour Mill. The water mill dates back 
 some 400 years. A little way on there 
 are some cottages within site of the  
  M42 motorway. A lady who has lived   
 here for 50 years describes the noise 
 of the cars, especially on rainy days.
 She described the sound like waves    
 beating the rocks on a seashore.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
