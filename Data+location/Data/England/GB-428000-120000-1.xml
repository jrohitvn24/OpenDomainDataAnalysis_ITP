		<title>01EAST WELLOW NEAR ROMSEY</title>
		<content> The area (East Wellow)is near Romsey, 
 bordering from the north by the main  
 road from Romsey to Salisbury.The area
 has many fields and chicken farms.The 
 crops that are grown are barley, wheat
 and oil seed rape. There are some     
 pigs,cows and chickens in East Wellow.
 Most people are quite wealthy, they   
 own quite big houses and gardens.The  
 houses that are thatched are mainly   
 from Tudor times. There is a church   
 in the middle of East Wellow which is 
 called St. Margarets.There are only a 
 limited range of shops selling mainly 
 essential goods.There are not many    
 leisure facilities but there is a     
 nearby golf course.Many of the lanes  
 are narrow which is becoming an       
 increasing problem as the population  
 in this much sought after area grows.
