		<title>17The School Fete.</title>
		<content>   We started to get ready for the     
 school fete quite early in the morning
 we had to take the chairs and tables  
 out of the classrooms and onto the    
 playground, it was overcast and we    
 hoped it would keep fine for the fete 
 so we coulkd raise money for the      
 school fund which would be spent on   
 books, equipment and visits.          
   Parents started to arrive about     
 twelve and they started to set up the 
 various stalls they were going to be  
 responsible for, there were book,     
 plants,  cakes and several games which
 you could play, these included 'Hit   
 the Rat' a game where a sock was      
 dropped down a tube and you had to try
 and hit it before it hit the ground.  
 Other games included Treasure         
 hunts,picking a square with a number  
 and the right number won a bottle of  
 whiskey.                              </content>
