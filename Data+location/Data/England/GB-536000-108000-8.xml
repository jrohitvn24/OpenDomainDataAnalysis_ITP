		<title>08LEWES TO BRIGHTON RAILWAY</title>
		<content>  The {Lewes }to {Brighton} Railway    
 runs parallel to the road and was     
 built in 1846.                        
 This first type of railway carried    
  carts and coaches just like those    
  used on the road, but now Diesel     
 Class Seventy Three run on this line  
 powered by a live electric rail.      
{The first }work was carried out by    
{Navvies},but now {Trackmen} do it,    
 who wear reflective {clothing }to     
 safeguard them. An accident happened  
 at {Lewes Station }where the boilers  
  blew up in 1879  and  the Driver,    
 Rookwood, was killed and his fireman  
 and a few others were hurt .Later in  
 1932, a child placed a sleeper on the 
 line which caused a de-railment,      
 killing  several people.   By STUART T
