		<content> DUNHOLME SPRING.                      
 The Spring located near the Beck and  
 the Church was bored in 1892 on orders
 of the Sanitary Authorities as the    
 people of Dunholme were drinking      
 polluted water and many were dying of 
 Diptheria.  The Spring is 100 ft deep 
 and it was restored in 1964. The event
 was featured on radio and B.B.C.      
 television.                           
                                       
 DUNHOLME PRIMARY SCHOOL.              
 Dunholme primary school children moved
 into new school buildings on the      
 Ryland Rd. in 1984. The old building  
 opposite the Church was originally    
 built as a Church School in 1861.It is
 hoped that the old school buildings   
 will be made into Parish meeting      
 rooms. Mr J. Jeffreys Headmaster of   
 the Primary school for 25 years       
 retired in July 1985. .               </content>
