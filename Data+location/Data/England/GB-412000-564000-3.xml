		<content>   Ryton Village Green}is the pride of 
 Ryton with the cross in the middle.   
 The cross was assembled by Thomas     
 Chancer in 1795 .The green as everyone
 calls it is one of the oldest things  
 in Ryton and it is said to be the     
  eart of Ryton.                       
   It was on the village green that the
 Ryton Hirings were held twice a year, 
 in May and in November.Although they  
 were mainly for the hiring of farm    
 servants,this was a day which drew    
 hundreds of people from neighbouring  
 villages to take part in the sports   
 and other attractions for the         
 visitors.The custom stopped in 1890.
