		<content>England's first canal was the          
Bridgewater canal which was built in   
1761.There was a problem of            
transporting coal from Worsley to the  
city of Manchester.The Bridgewater     
canal was so successful that the price 
of coal was halved.In the 60 years     
following this canal-mania resulted in 
many miles of new canals.The Preston to
 Lancaster link was finished too late  
for it to be of benefit to industry as 
a result the canal is used by pleasure 
craft during holidays and at weekends. 
Locks are used in the places when land 
is not level.Locks are water steps each
one having a set of gates to let boats 
in and out.The lock gates are opened by
a windlass on the winder.When the boat 
is in the lock the boat is driven in   
and the water is let up or down.With   
the water at the right height the boat 
is driven out.                         </content>
