		<content>  Every night when we come home from   
 school we go to the park.There are    
 swings,monkey bars and a slide.There  
 is plenty of space and we play        
 rounders,cricket,football and use the 
 wall ball.Sometimes we play games of  
 catch and even join in with the girls 
 when they start chanting songs.       
  We like to break dance as we         
 moonwalk,crabwalk and headspin.We can 
 also catterpillar,side slide and King 
 Tuck.It takes a lot of patience and   
 practice to break dance.              
  When we get bored we put our money   
 together and buy a choice of sweets   
 and organise competitions to win them.
  Occasionally we get out our bicycles 
 and build small ramps to jump over and
 obstacles to ride around.When you have
 a few friends to play with time seems 
 to fly.When there is nobody to play   
 with on my street it gets boring.     </content>
