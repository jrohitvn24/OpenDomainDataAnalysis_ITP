 in a deserted area of wasteland in    
 Camp Hill.The puppy was rescued around
 midnight by residents of Willow Road  
 after they heard it crying.           
                                       
 More than 50 energetic 'fun runners'  
 from the Griffin Inn have been        
 pounding the pavement to earn money   
 for charity.They raised Â£256.         
                                       
 An opportunist thief stole Â£150 kept  
 in a jar at a house in Hillcrest      
 Road.The occupier was working in the  
 garden at the time.

 reduce accidents at the A5 / Watling  
 Street junction with Higham Lane.A
