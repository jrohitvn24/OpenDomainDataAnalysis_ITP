		<content> The area is one of high wooded areas  
 disected by two minor streams, the    
 Umborne Brook and the Offwell Brook   
 which both run into the River Coly,   
 then via River Axe to the sea at      
 Seaton. The general appearance is one 
 of small dairy farming in the valleys 
 with woods and high meadows in the    
 elevated areas. The main Waterloo     
 Exeter railway line disects the east  
 section, with a short section of the  
 A35 (Honiton-Folkston Trunk road)     
 clipping the north east corner. 2     
 minor roads of local importance run   
 N-S connecting Honiton &amp; Colyton. The 
 other roads are unclassified. Parts of
 the low lying valleys are liableto    
 flooding with the unclassified minor  
 roads quickly closed.If the snow falls
 heavily this area is quickly cut off. 
 Rape is a currently popular crop.
