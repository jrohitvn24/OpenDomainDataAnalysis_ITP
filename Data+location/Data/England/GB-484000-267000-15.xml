 from 9 until 5. Every year there is a 
 Christmas concert and later in the    
 year a musical is performed. In past  
 years The Wizard of Oz, Oliver and    
 Oklahoma have been shown. There is a  
 staff of 65 teachers for 1000 pupils. 
 There is an intake of about 200       
 children in the first year. Originally
 the building was a factory and later  
 became Wellingborough Technical       
 Grammar School. Then it became one of 
 Wellingborough's first Comprehensive  
 schools, with a catchment area in the 
 western side of the town. The school  
 has a thriving orchestra and a Science
 Road Show which visit local Primary   
 schools.                              </content>
