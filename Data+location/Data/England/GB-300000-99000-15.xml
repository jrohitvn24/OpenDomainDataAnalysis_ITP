		<content> The Manor had a reliable gas supply at
 the beginning of the century. In the  
 cellar is the first oil boiler to be  
 installed in Devon.                   
 There were no washing facilities until
 the 1930's.                           
 There are 12 bedrooms but now we only 
 use 5. In the building beside the     
 house there is an organ loft built in 
 1890.                                 
 The entertainments room was built     
 later with a stage. It was used as the
 Village Hall until the present hall   
 was built in 1976.                    
 The army used the house during the two
 wars and we think that they built some
 of the out houses.There is still an   
 ammunition store (empty) in the little
 copse.                                
 The garden includes the old kitchen   
 garden which was given to the school  
 as a playing field.                   </content>
