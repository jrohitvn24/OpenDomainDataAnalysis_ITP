		<content> On Saturday morning I awoke early,as I
 was going riding with Melanie on her  
 pony,Toby.I got out my old clothes and
 had my breakfast.After I had washed   
 and cleaned my teeth,I set off on my  
 bike.When I arrived Melanie was       
 waiting with Toby.I had first ride,   
 which I thoroughly enjoyed.When it was
 time for dinner,I went home for a meal
 and collected my swimming things as I 
 was going to Coastfields Pool.There I 
 played on the slide and ducks.I was so
 brave and jumped off the diving board 
 which was at the deep end,but I was   
 really quite safe as I could swim 75  
 metres.After a bit of playing about in
 the water I went home for tea and got 
 changed.I went out with my Mum and Dad
 to the Three Tuns Pub.I had a bag of  
 crisps and a drink of Coke.On the     
 way home we bought some chips and then
 went to bed.                          </content>
