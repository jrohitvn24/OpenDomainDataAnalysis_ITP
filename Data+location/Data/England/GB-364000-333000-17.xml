		<content> There are three Dental Practices      
 in the town. All three are similar    
 although one, Geldeard's is more      
 recently established. They all carry  
 out all forms of treatment mainly     
 within the National Health Service but
 with a few private  patients. An      
 appointment system operates. Each     
 practice has two or three Dental      
 Surgeons, several Dental Surgery      
 Assistants and Receptionists. A       
 General Medical Practitioner visits   
 regularly to administer general       
 anaesthetics. Difficult cases are     
 referred to Shrewsbury or Stoke.      
 Dentures are made locally or in       
 Shrewsbury or Newcastle.There is now a
 greater emphasis on conservation and  
 prevention. A greater patient awarenes
 together with measures such as        
 flouride in toothpaste has brought    
 about a reduction in tooth decay.     </content>
