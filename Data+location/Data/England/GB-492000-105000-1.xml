 mainly pasture.The central area is    
 either arable land or for {market     
{gardening}. The eastern side is mainly
{housing}.Westergate is part of a      
 ribbon development that joins up with 
 Eastergate,Barnham,Yapton and         
 Aldingbourne to form the "5           
 villages".In recent years every piece 
 of land along the main roads has been 
 built upon with houses.{Local
