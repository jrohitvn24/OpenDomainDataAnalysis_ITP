		<content>            MRS. WRIGHT                
     A group of children went to       
 interview Mrs. Wright at her home.    
     She was born in the Nancy Inn and 
 she has lived in the village all her  
 life.                                 
     When she was born the Nancy Inn   
 was a blacksmith's, not a pub. The    
 pub. was in Cross Keys' Cottage which 
 is next to the church.                
     She was married in 1926 and during
 the war she changed her living room   
 into a shop. She closed the shop when 
 her husband died.                     
     Her Grandfather was the village   
 carrier and, today, Wright's Haulage  
 Contractors are still based in the    
 village.                              
     Mrs. Wright used to know all the  
 people in the village when she was    
 small but now it has grown bigger     
 there are many that she doesn't know. </content>
