		<content> At the moment,in our area,SDP(Social  
 Democratic Party)are in power.        
 Conservatives are not very popular in 
 this area,and Labour are in the       
 middle.The SDP seems to have made many
 promises and not kept them.Labour used
 to be in power,and were quite an      
 effective government,but,like the SDP 
 did not keep their promises.Labour    
 seemed more caring for your community 
 than either Conservative or SDP.At the
 moment,schools are used as polling    
 stations,as well as church halls,and  
 this makes it easier for people to    
 vote,as there are schools in almost   
 every community.
