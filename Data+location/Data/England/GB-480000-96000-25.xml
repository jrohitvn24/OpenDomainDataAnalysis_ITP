<title>25East Wittering - School Field</title>
<content>

The school field measures 265.5m long and 130m wide.  We are very lucky to still have such a large space for playing.  &lt;br />&lt;br />As well as being used for running and football our field has a maze made from long grass in which a lot of wildlife can be found.  There is also areas for wildlife at the end of the field.  Our field is one of the quietest places where you can relax or take time to think. &lt;br />&lt;br />On the field there are two trim trails - these are a lot of fun.  There is a bumble bee for ball games and the whole field is surrounded by trees.   &lt;br />
