		<title>01GENERAL BACKGROUND</title>
		<content>{FARMING}has been the dominant feature 
 of this part of Central Essex for many
 centuries.The{SOIL}is heavy clay but  
 fertile and currently specializes in{ 
{ARABLE}cultiviation.Land is expensive,
 as much as Â£2,800.00 an acre.{GREEN   
{BELT}policies restrict new building.  
{POPULATION}is small and centres on 3  
 hamlets. Many are now affluent commu- 
 ters. Only one{MAJOR ROAD}crosses this
 area,the A414 linking Chelmsford with 
 Ongar. Other roads are fairly quiet   
 country lanes. There are few{EMPLOY-  
{MENT}opportunities here,local farmers 
 employ only a handful of skilled men. 
{COMMUNITY LIFE}centres on a chapel    
 and 3 pubs.{FACILITIES}are inadequate 
 for those without their own transport.
 The siting of the 3rd London Airport  
 at Stansted and easy access to trunk  
 roads will put more pressure on the   
 Ecology and existing Social Structure.</content>
