		<title>16EGMANTON PILGRIMAGES</title>
		<content> Religion in Britain takes many forms. 
 On Saturday 17th August 1985 some     
 hundred or so people gathered in      
 Egmanton Church. They were making a   
 pilgrimage to the church which        
 contains the Shrine of our Lady of    
 Egmanton.                             
    The Patron of the church is one of 
 the Catholic societies of the Church  
 of England. One of its objectives is  
 "The promotion and maintenance of     
 Catholic teaching and practice."      
    The pilgrimages are run by the     
 "Society of our Lady of Egmanton".    
 Very few villagers are involved except
 in providing refreshments for the     
 visitors. Most village people do not  
 appreciate the historical significance
 of this very high church event.       
    Comper's reconstruction figure of  
 Mother and Child is paraded around the
 village.                              </content>
