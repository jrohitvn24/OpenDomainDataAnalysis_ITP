		<title>12SUPERMARKETS IN HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> Herns Bay's two busiest shops each    
 fall within this block they are the   
 large foodshops which belong to the   
 Safeway and Tesco chain of stores.    
 Work was begun on Safeways, the newer 
 of the two, in 1978 and the store was 
 opened two years later. This store    
 incorporates its own bakery and off   
 licence and it sells a range of       
 stationery and other non food         
 products. The roof of the store can be
 used by customers for free parking and
 this car park is served by            
 lifts.Safeways has become very popular
 and its wide aisles make for easier   
 shopping than in Tescos its main rival
 although the Tesco prices tend to be  
 slightly lower. Also as Tescos is some
 distance from a car park people buying
 in bulk would usually use Safeways.
