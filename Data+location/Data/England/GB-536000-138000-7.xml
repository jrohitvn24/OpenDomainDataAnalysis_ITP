		<content> Bus and train services are thought to 
 be poor making it difficult to visit  
 patients in Cuckfield and Crawley     
 hospitals.Therefore improvements were 
 wanted at the Queen Victoria Hospital 
 for better maternity and old peoples' 
 facilities,so that patients were      
 nearer home.Improvements to the clinic
 and the need for a National Health    
 Service Nursing Home for the elderly  
 were also considered necessary.       
 Legislation was wanted to restrict    
 smoking in public and to punish dog   
 owners who allowed their pets to foul 
 public places.There was concern about 
 the lack of discipline in schools and 
 many said that they would prefer      
 smaller comprehensive schools, or     
 return to selection and the           
 re-introduction of grammar schools.   
 Many considered that all schools      
 should have a nursery wing.           </content>
