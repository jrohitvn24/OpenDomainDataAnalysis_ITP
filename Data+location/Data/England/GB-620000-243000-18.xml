   My hobbies are dancing, swimming and
Cubs.   My  favouite  hobby  is dancing
because I am fairly good.   I go to the
Ipswich School Of Dancing and I have 64
medals, trophies, cups and shields, and
a big scroll made of wood.    I compete
in International and  Open competitions
in places  like  Norwich,  Hammersmith,
Crystal  Palace  and  The  Albert Hall.
                                       
                                       
   I  have  been  dancing  for  about 3
years and during that  time I have  had
three partners.   I went  to  two other
dancing schools  before the one I go to
now.  The Ipswich School Of Dancing has
not  been  beaten in competitions for 5
years.
