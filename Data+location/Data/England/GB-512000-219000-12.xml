 Oil can be recycled to be used for    
 purposes such as heat in homes and in 
 factories.Scrap metal can be recycled 
 also and used for special purposes.   
 But things like garden refuse cannot  
 be used again. The things range from  
 oil to garden waste. The most horrible
 thing that has been dumped was two    
 kittens in a plastic bag and they     
 would have been crushed but luckily   
 someone heard them mioawing and they  
 saved them. The rubbish is split into 
 4 different categories. These are     
 scrap metal,hardcore and soil,house   
 hold rubbish and garden refuse. There 
 is also a bottle bank there but it is 
 owned by Luton Borough Council. Some  
 of the money goes to charity. All the 
 rubbish at the weekend fills 5 extra  
 skips.
