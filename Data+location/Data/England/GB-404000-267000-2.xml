		<title>02Church Hill - a new estate.</title>
		<content>{Church Hill}was started to be built in
 1975 on farm land. Church Hill is now 
 fully built and maturing. The old     
 village of{Beoley,}with{St. Leonard's 
{Church}on the hill, overlooks Church  
 Hill. From the seat in my classroom I 
 can see the surrounding countryside.  
 Many trees, hedges and pools have been
 left from the old fields. This has    
 helped the new housing look more      
 established. Some new roads follow the
 routes of farm tracks and part of the 
 old{Icknield Street}has been made into
 a footpath through the estate. Several
 old buildings have been retained. The 
{Marlfield Barn}has been converted into
 a community centre by the{Residents'  
{Association.}Old houses have been     
 incorporated into the new{Y.M.C.A.    
 housing complex, and an old marl pool 
 included in the design of the local   
 shopping centre.                      </content>
