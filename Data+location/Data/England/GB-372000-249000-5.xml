      Suckley and its environs has only
 one area of housing at Longley Green, 
 some of the cottages dating from the  
 14th century.  The rest of the area is
 devoted to farms, many of which have  
 recently converted outhouses, oast    
 houses and barns into residential     
 accommodation.                        
                                       
      Two small pockets of council     
 housing have been constructed - one of
 'Airey' houses, built during the      
 Second World War and an adjoining     
 collection of retirement bungalows.   
                                       
      The only housing development now 
 permitted is a certain amount of      
 infilling at Longley Green.
