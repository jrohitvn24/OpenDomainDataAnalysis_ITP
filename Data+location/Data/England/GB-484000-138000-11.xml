		<content> FARMING.                              
 Much of the area is covered by        
 farmland.Most of this is used for     
 growing fruit and vegetables.When     
 these are ready for harvesting,these  
 farms are open for the public to      
 "pick your own".Strawberries,         
 raspberries,red and blackcurrants,    
 gooseberries and apples as well as    
 runner beans,broad beans,and peas     
 are grown on these farms.             
 Some of the produce is sent to market,
 but "pick your own" suits both the    
 farmer and the customer as it cuts out
 the middle-man.The housewife gets     
 really  fresh fruit and vegetables,and
 they are much cheaper.                
 A firm of Landscape gardeners is kept 
 very busy,especially in the bigger    
 houses,maintaining fencing and        
 footpaths,and planning gardens.       
 One farm keeps sheep.                 </content>
