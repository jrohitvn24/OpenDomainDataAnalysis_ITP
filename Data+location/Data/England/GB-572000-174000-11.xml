		<content>In January we went to London to see    
"Wind in The Willows" at Sadlers Wells.
We stopped at Greenwich for lunch and  
saw the Cutty Sark. In April we went to
Mr.Wright's farm and we saw a lamb     
being born.Our topic this term was     
Eskimos,and we did Pinocchio,Fairground
and made some puppets and theatres. We 
made an igloo that we can play in and  
some clay models.                      
In the Summer term we got a play house 
and fort for our field.A book shop was 
opened in our school and we had a fete.
Soon it will be Sports Day and we are  
going to visit London.Our topic this   
term has been the Domesday Project and 
we have had tadpoles and incubated some
eggs.At the end of term Mr.King,our    
headmaster,is going to retire.Then I   
will go into another class but I think 
being in Class 2 has been fabulous!!
