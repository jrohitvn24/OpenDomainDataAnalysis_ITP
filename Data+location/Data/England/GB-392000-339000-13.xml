		<title>13MEIR PARK DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content>Meir Park is a housing estate and it   
was started on the aerodrome in 1972.  
There are about 900 houses built and   
they are planning to build about 600   
more houses.There are a few companies  
building such as Lowe Homes,Tarmac and 
BarrattÂ£s.One way of building is called
self building.This includes signing a  
contract which makes you work several  
hours a week for 18 months.If you donÂ£t
complete your hours of work in 18      
months you are fined.Meir Park also has
4 factories called Staffordshire       
Potteries,Edwards and Jones,J.R Hill,  
Harrison Mayer Ramsden and a Telecom   
depot.These buildings are situated on  
the Northern side of Meir Park.There is
also a public playing field alongside  
the housing estate.The playing fields  
will partly disappear because the      
estate is growing but there will always
be some grass left to play and walk on.</content>
