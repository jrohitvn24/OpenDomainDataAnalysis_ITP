		<title>09A Workshift at the Pit</title>
		<content> I set the alarm for quarter to four in
 the morning. I get up get ready put   
 the dog out have a cup of tea.I have a
 smoke and bring the dog in. I set off 
 to work at about ten past five in the 
 morning.I meet my mates at about      
 twenty past five.Myself and my mates  
 set off to work.We walked to the pit  
 at Thurcroft.When we get there we go  
 to the time checks and then it is off 
 to get ready to go underground when we
 get underground there are  quite a lot
 of jobs that need doing.then          
 pick coal from the coal face using  a 
 pick.the coal is shovelled on to a    
 belt and taken to the surfase.I have  
 my break underground,eating sandwiches
 from my snap tin.After the break I    
 carry on working until 1.30.When I    
 return to the surface I go to the pit 
 baths to get cleaned up before        
 returning home.                       </content>
