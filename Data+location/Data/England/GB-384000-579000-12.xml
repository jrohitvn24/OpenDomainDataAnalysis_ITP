		<content> They called in a number of the        
 Colonels retainers to help. At about  
{midnight}Edward blew the dead man's   
 silver wind call, and soon afterwards 
 several riders approached. Edward     
 fired Copenhagen, which was a signal  
 for the other guns to fire, and four  
 robbers were hit. The remainder fled  
 but returned during the night to      
 recover the bodies of their comrades. 
 Although rewards were offered none of 
 the culprits were traced. In          
{Bellingham churchyard}is a grave stone
 in the shape of a long pack, but the  
 identity of the body which lies       
 beneath has never been discovered.    
 Near Birtley is the{Devil's Stone, }  
 which stands above the Holy Well. On  
 the stone are hoof marks,said to be   
 made by the Devil when he tried to    
 jump across the river but was drowned 
 in{Leap Crag Pool. }                  </content>
