		<content> I woke up, got out of bed and opened  
 my gerbil cage and looked at the      
 babies which had been born yesterday. 
 I went down stairs.  I was the last   
 person out of bed.  After breakfast, I
 cleaned my teeth and brushed my hair. 
 I said to my mum "What shall I wear?" 
 She replied, "We might be going       
 swimming so put on your bathing       
 trunks.                               
 We decided we would go swimming.  We  
 packed a picnic and drove to Wittering
 beach.  When we got there we sat on   
 the beach and unpacked our things.  I 
 have only just learned to swim in the 
 swimming pools,so I was finding it    
 hard to swim in the sea.  I made it in
 the end.  I came out and sunbathed but
 then we had to go home today was fun  
 and I would like to do the same again 
 soon.                                 
                                       </content>
