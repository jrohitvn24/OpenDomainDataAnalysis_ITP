		<title>13BROOK HILL HOUSE.</title>
		<content>{ BROOK HILL HOUSE}is situated on a    
 hill surrounded by coniferous trees,  
 on the outskirts of{BRIGHSTONE FOREST.
 It is a large,impressive building and 
 is one of the local landmarks.The     
 property may be seen from a distance  
 as it is very prominant.              
   This large residence was built in   
 1914 and was at one time inhabited by 
{J.B.PRIESTLY}.Recently the house was  
 converted into a series of flats for  
 holiday use.This move by the owner was
 not popular with the locals.          
   Further local feeling has recently  
 been aroused by the plans of the      
 landlord to build bungalows in the    
 grounds.                              
   The grounds of the the house are    
 very extensive and include tennis     
 courts.
