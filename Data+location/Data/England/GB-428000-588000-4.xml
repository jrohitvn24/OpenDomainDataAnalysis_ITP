		<content> IT FIRST CAME ON THE{BEACH} IN        
 1939,BEFORE THE SECOND WORLD WAR      
 STARTED. IT WAS TIPPED IN AS PIT      
 WASTE.IT CAME ON THE BEACH BY ARIAL   
 FLIGHT. WHEN THE TIDE COMES IN IT     
 WASHES IT OUT TO ANOTHER PLACE FURTHER
 SOUTH, WHEN THE TIDE GOES OUT PEOPLE  
 GO TO GATHER IT IN BUCKETS AND SMALL  
 SACKS AND USE IT FOR THEIR{FIRES.}    
 THE{COAL}WAGONS COME AND THE BULL-    
 DOZERS COME TO FILL THE WAGONS. THE   
 WAGONS TAKE THE COAL TO THE{POWER}    
{STATIONS.}                            
 BEFORE THE COAL WAS THERE IT WAS A    
 VERY NICE BEACH FROM THE MOOR TO      
 CRESSWELL POINT.WHEN THE N.C.B.ENDS   
 ITS LIFE THEY MUST RESTORE THE BEACH  
 TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE.NOW A DAYS      
 PEOPLE GO WITH HORSES AND CARTS TO    
 GATHER IT.
