		<content> Miss Pymm lives at Holly House, a     
 lovely old stone cottage built of     
 local limestone. It is situated       
 opposite the post office in the middle
 of Barrowby village. She is the local 
 secretary of the R.S.P.C.A. and is    
 involved in fund raising activities   
 such as coffee mornings and jumble    
 sales. If any animals are in          
 difficulty or hurt then Miss Pymm will
 help and will even find homes for     
 them. She has several cats for        
 company. Her numerous interests       
 include looking after the Reading Room
 in Church Street, being a school      
 governor at the local primary school  
 and a member of Barrowby Church       
 Council. She is very popular with     
 everyone and always has a friendly    
 greeting.
