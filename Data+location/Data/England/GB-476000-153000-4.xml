		<content>{St. Mary's Church,Winchfield}is       
 believed to date from 1150. The       
 Chancel Arch is Norman. The Church    
 contains memorials to the             
 Rudyerd,Beauclerk &amp; Charrington       
 families who have owned the Manor at  
 various times. Morning services are   
 held fortnightly &amp; afternoon services/
 Sunday-school are held every Sunday.  
    Near the M3 is the site of{Wintney 
{Priory}(founded c.1190 for Cistercian 
 Nuns). Only a section of wall remains.
{St.Mary's Church, Hartley Wintney,}was
 in regular use from 1234 until 1870   
 when St.John's Church was built in    
 nearby Hartley Wintney. St.Mary's is  
 now maintained as a redundant Church  
 by public donations. It is sometimes  
 used for weddings &amp; the cemetery is   
 next to it.The recently discovered    
{Medieval wall paintings}are the main  
 treasure in this rural Church.        </content>
