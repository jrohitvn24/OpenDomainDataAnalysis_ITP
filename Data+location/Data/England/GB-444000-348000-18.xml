		<content> In Brinsley itself there are not many 
 places of employment.A good many      
 people will be redundant or be        
 transferred to other local mines in   
 Underwood very shortly for the pit is 
 being closed down.Brinsleys own pit   
 closed down a few years ago and this  
 sadly is similar to the situation in  
 other parts of Britain today.Many     
 people go out of the area to work :to 
 Eastwood,Nottingham,Derby and other   
 places.There is certainly a problem of
 unemployment for some people in the   
 area.We have some farms in the        
 area,including arable farming,pigs and
 cattle.There are few industries.      
 One of note is a local"Craft Shop"    
 which is as near as we come to a      
 tourist industry in the area!There is 
 a small firm that does a lot of       
 fencing,several self employed         
 electricians,plumbers and small shops.</content>
