		<title>14Social Provision in Adisham</title>
		<content>  There is no evidence of poverty in   
Adisham and little unemployment.  The  
villagers organise a prescription      
service and arrange outings. Home Helps
are sent as needed and there is a      
visiting barber. There is a telephone  
box, two postal collections daily and a
mobile library visits weekly. Money is 
raised locally for equipment for the   
children.  General fears were the atom 
bomb, violence, burglary, drugs,and    
pollution. The elderly regretted the   
loss of trees and atmosphere due to    
increased building and population.     
They also feared the closure of the    
station and shop.  Canterbury Planning 
Authority were condemned for allowing  
excessive building and planning        
generally. Farmers stubble burning and 
spraying aroused concern. There was    
also concern about the lack of poten-  
tial leaders for future activities.    </content>
