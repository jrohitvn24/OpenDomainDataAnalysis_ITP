In my spare time I do canoing,sailing, 
reading, fishing and lots of other     
things. My favourite leisure is        
fishing. The biggest fish I ever caught
was on holiday. It was a mackerel. It  
was about 47cms long and 6 cms wide. We
had 49 mackerel. I helped my dad and   
brother gut the fish. I cut off the    
head, tail and fins and also scrape    
the guts out. My hands were covered in 
blood. We put the guts in a sealed bag.
  My brother and I saw a boy with a    
sword fish. It was about 52 cms long.  
It was only a little one. It had a     
pointed nose.                          
  For tea we had mackerel, peas and    
chips with butter on the peas and fish.
It was very nice indeed.
