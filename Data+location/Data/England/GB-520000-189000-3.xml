		<title>03THE R.A.F. MUSEUM - HENDON</title>
		<content>   The R.A.F.Museum was opened in 1972.
 During the war,the Grahame White      
 Aircraft factory and the London       
 Aerodrome were all nearby. This is the
 reason for the present site of the    
 Museum in which approximately 80      
 people work.                          
   Most of the planes in the Museum    
 were in World War II and while some   
 could work again, it would be a very  
 expensive operation.The oldest plane  
 here is called the Bleriot and a model
 of an early glider can also be        
 seen in the Museum.                   
   In 1957,there was a large air       
 exhibition which could be seen for    
 miles around as the Grahame Park      
 Estate had not been built.The Museum  
 is a permanent reminder of the early  
 days of flying and frequently attracts
 visitors from all over the world.
