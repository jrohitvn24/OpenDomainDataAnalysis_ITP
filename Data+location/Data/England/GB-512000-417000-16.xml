		<content>   If a footpath was built it would    
 make the road dangerously narrow near 
 the bend. Many large lorries use this 
 road.                                 
   The Shopping Centre is small because
 the village is small. Many families   
 shop outside the village at           
 Supermarkets such as Tates in         
 Immingham, Fine Fare in Barton or     
 Asdas in Grimsby. Prices are lower in 
 those shops and there is a wider range
 of goods for sale. Families without   
 their own car usually use the village 
 shops because travel is expensive and 
 difficult with few buses.             
   Other families use the village shops
 when they only want a few items or    
 haven't the time for a 'big shop'. A  
 survey carried out in the school      
 showed that most people used the      
 village shops to buy newspapers, bread
 and sweets.                           </content>
