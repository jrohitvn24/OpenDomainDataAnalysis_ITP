		<title>06Stodmarsh Church.</title>
		<content>    {St. Mary's Church}is small and    
 very old and can seat up to sixty     
 people. It has a small square wooden{ 
{bell turret}which has a shingled      
 spire. There are two{bells}which are  
 believed to be some of the oldest in  
 Kent. Near the door are some          
 crusaders' marks. The newest part of  
 the church is the{north wall}which    
 fell down a hundred years ago. The    
 beams are oak, and they are original  
 which means they have been up since   
 the church was first built.           
     Behind the curtain it is very damp
 because of the{high water table;}never
 _theless the rest of the church is    
 clean, bright and cheerful. When      
 Gregory Holdstock died recently they  
 could not bury him in Stodmarsh with  
 his family because the grave would    
 have filled up with water. The last   
 grave was dug in the 1930's.          </content>
