		<content> Broadhempston is a beautiful old      
 village with a population of about    
 400 living mainly in old houses of    
 character or more modern houses       
 and bungalows built to fill in        
 gaps along the main street or in      
 the separate area on the hill         
 known as Houndhead. The               
 village was mentioned in Domesday     
 and has grown up around the church and
 a valley street with a pub at each    
 end. It has resisted change in its    
 character so a present proposal to    
 build 17 starter homes and 6 Council  
 pensioners' homes is very unpopular.  
 Because of small numbers the church,  
 the school, the single shop and the   
 four times daily bus service to Newton
 Abbot are always under threat.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
