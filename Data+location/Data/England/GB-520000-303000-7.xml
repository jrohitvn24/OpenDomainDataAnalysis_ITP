		<content>  In the sample of the population      
 surveyed only 30% did their weekly    
 grocery shopping in the nearest       
 supermarket.The rest travelled some   
 two to six miles further.For clothes  
 and household items over 60% shopped  
 in Peterborough,the nearest city      
 centre.Many considered village prices 
 higher than normal for all retail     
 goods.                                
  In this age of the plastic credit    
 card and cheque guarantee card it is  
 surprising to find that 81% of the    
 sample actually used cash.This may    
 well be because many of the population
 are agricultural workers and these    
 employees are still payed weekly in   
 cash.                                 
  It was hardly surprising to find that
 the most popular shopping days were   
 Friday and Saturday with Thursday a   
 close third.                          </content>
