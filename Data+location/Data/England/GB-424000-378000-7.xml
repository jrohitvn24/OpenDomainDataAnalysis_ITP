 series of familiar calls and whistles 
 from his master to follow the set     
 course until the sheep are finally    
 penned. Points are awarded for each   
 manoeuvre and a time limit is imposed 
 depending upon whether the Trial is a 
 single or double dog class. On the    
 Thursday, the hound trail provided the
 spectacular sight of dogs chasing rags
 dipped in Aniseed and Paraffin across 
 the moors. Also, a dog parade for best
 Bitch and Dog was sponsored by the    
 Sheffield Telegraph and Star, an event
 which has no doubt improved the       
 appearance of the competitive dogs.   
 Highlights on Saturday were the Local 
 and Novice classes but the trials     
 provide an entertaining day out for   
 all age groups.
