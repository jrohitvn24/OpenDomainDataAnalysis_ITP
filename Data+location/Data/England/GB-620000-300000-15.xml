		<content> The Rev. Philip McFadyen is the vicar 
 of Swardeston Church. He is in charge 
 of four parishes and five churches.   
 These are Intwood, Keswick,           
 Swardeston, East Carleton and         
 Ketteringham.                         
 The main areas of a vicar's work in   
 this area are raising money for the   
 churches and trying to make people    
 aware of Christ. A vicar is also      
 responsible for training people to    
 read services. He goes to Christian   
 studies at the University, visits     
 schools, and also goes to the         
 Cathedral.                            
 His normal day's work consists of     
 studying, prayers, services, visiting 
 people in hospitals and meetings. He  
 enjoys visiting old people and        
 dislikes having to raise money.
