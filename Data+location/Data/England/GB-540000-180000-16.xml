 The Mayflower Centre costs 160,000    
 pounds to run each year. Edward       
 Furness, the warden, has over thirty  
 staff. Between 1,000 - 1,500 people   
 use the Mayflower each week, including
 pensioners, unemployed, teenagers,    
 youngsters, mums and toddlers, mums   
 and grans, nursery groups and youth   
 clubs, Church Fellowship, sports hall 
 and Advice Desk. In the hungry 1930's 
 if you went to church you would get   
 some soup and a roll. In 1957 the     
 Mayflower Centre was opened and run by
 David Sheppard. The new Sports Hall   
 was opened by the Queen Mother in     
 1981. The Mayflower is a Christian    
 Centre that serves all the family.
