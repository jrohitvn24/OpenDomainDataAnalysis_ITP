		<title>18Traffic On Whitchurch Lane</title>
		<content> The road system consists of a network 
 of country lanes on either side of the
 A37.One of these,Whitchurch Lane,has  
 changed in the last twenty years from 
 a quiet,narrow country lane to a busy 
 suburban road.People who live on the  
 modern housing estates use the road   
 to commute to the centre of Bristol.  
 Whitchurch Lane also provides a route 
 from the industrial areas in South    
 Bristol,including large enterprises   
 such as 'Harveys' and 'The Imperial   
 Group'at Hartcliffe,to the A37 road.  
 Here are the results of a traffic     
 survey taken on Tuesday 16th July 1985
 in Whitchurch Lane.                   
                cars lorries vans buses

 During the rush hour the traffic      
 increases.There are no pedestrian     
 crossings but there is a subway.      </content>
