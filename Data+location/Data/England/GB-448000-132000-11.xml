 industries in the area since early    
 times.There are tenant farms,private  
 ownership farms and Bridgets the      
 Experimental farm.                    
   The five tenant farmers rent their  
 land from the Hampshire County Council

 approximately 100 acres (40           
 hectares).The  farms are mainly dairy 
 farms with Friesian herds and         
 heifers to restock.The cows are       
 milked in herring bone parlours,the   
 milk collected in bulk carriers each  
 day.Some farms have a sheep stock and 
 sell free range hens eggs.

{Husbandry}farm taken over by the      
 Ministry  of Agriculture in 1948.
