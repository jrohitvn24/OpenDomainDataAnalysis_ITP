		<content>{  CATERHAM CARNIVAL}is held annually  
 with a fair. It was first held in 1957
 and has been going ever since. The    
 Carnival Committee aims to raise funds
 for various causes. In 1985 money was 
 given to the{12th CATERHAM SCOUT GROUP
 to renovate their H.Q.; to{CATERHAM   
{S.C.C.}to buy equipment &amp; canoes; the 
{ROTARY CLUB}of Caterham for repair and
 decoration of the{COMMUNITY CENTRE.}  
   In 1985 there were 18 floats in the 
 procession led by the Carnival Queen. 
 The scout group made a 'ghost buster' 
 float and there were a Viking Ship, an
 Egyptian float and a British Telecom  
 float.                                
   Although it was exciting to watch   
 one of the cubs said the best part of 
 the Carnival was getting ready for it.
  In 1985 the{CATERHAM WIND BAND}played
 and in the arena guides gave displays 
 of tent pitching &amp; fire lighting.     </content>
