		<content>{Public:-}The nearest railway stations 
 are at Cambridge (12 miles) and       
 Dullingham (8 miles).                 
     The buses are the only kind       
 available in the area and run as      
 folllows: Several daily services into 
 Cambridge Monday to Saturday; a twice 
 weekly service into Haverhill, the    
 Friday (market day) one introduced    
 only this year due to the initiative  
 of a West Wickham housewife; one      
 weekly service to Newmarket also on   
 market day. Unfortunately there are no
 buses on Sundays or after 6pm. Free   
 school buses are provided. One daily  
 each for the primary school children  
 to Balsham and secondary school       
 children to Linton.                   
{Private:-}Nearly every household has a
 car or has access to one. This is     
 supplemented by locally run taxi      
 services.                             </content>
