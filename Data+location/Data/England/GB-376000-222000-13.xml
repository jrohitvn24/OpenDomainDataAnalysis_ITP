		<content> Through the area two important roads  
 provide access to the M.50; B4216     
 Highnam-Newent and A.417 Gloucester   
 -Ledbury. It is proposed to reclassify
 the B4216 to become an 'A' road - main
 route to the motorway. From a traffic 
 count outside Hartpury School we found
 that 380 vehicles per hour pass; the  
 rate increases on Gloucester Market   
 Days. The Survey also showed that 77% 
 of villagers wanted the speed limit   
 lowered to 30 m.p.h., because of the  
 two dangerous bends in the centre of  
 the village. Whilst the majority of   
 families have a car, we found that 15%
 of those surveyed still used public   
 transport. There are 3 bus services ; 
 Swanbrook Transport for Hartpury; the 
 National Welsh Omnibus along B.4216;  
 and Bennett Coaches to Highleadon.
