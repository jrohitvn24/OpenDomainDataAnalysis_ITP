		<title>14Leisure in Woodhalls</title>
		<content> The small farms which occupy this area
 offer their occupants very little     
 spare time,and it is significant that 
 many so-called 'leisure'activities are
 an integral part of rural life.These  
 include the making of jams and        
 chutneys,the preserving of meat and   
 vegetables,and the brewing of wine and
 beer.Needlework and flower arranging  
 are also popular, as are reading and  
 television.Evenings spent wining and  
 dining are also occasionally enjoyed, 
 both at home hosting friends and at   
 local hotels and pubs.                
     There is considerable support for 
 community affairs encompassing church 
 and chapel, political organizations,  
 local council committees,farming      
 associations etc.Outdoor activities   
 strongly associated with rural life   
 cover:-riding club events,hunting,    
 shooting,fishing and wildlife studies.</content>
