		<title>13LAW AND ORDER IN BROMPTON</title>
		<content> The village policeman resident in     
 Brompton has also to cover Danby Wiske
 ,Streetlam,part of Deighton,Winton ,  
 Kirby Sigston,Sowerby-under-Cotcliffe 
 &amp; Bullamoor outside Northallerton town
 area.Farming matters involving fire   
 arms,poaching,trespass &amp; farm         
 accidents form a part of his work     
 which is otherwise largely taken up   
 with domestic disputes,under age      
 drinking,drunkenness &amp; vandalism.These
 cases are relatively few &amp; there is   
 little serious crime in the area.The  
 constable controls people &amp; traffic on
 village occasions eg.Whitsuntide      
 Carnival.His local knowledge is       
 invaluable in solving petty crime &amp;   
 would be a starting point for any     
 major investigation.He is also        
 actively involved in the community    
 eg.Youth Club,Squash Club,Rugby Club &amp;
 giving talks on crime prevention.     </content>
