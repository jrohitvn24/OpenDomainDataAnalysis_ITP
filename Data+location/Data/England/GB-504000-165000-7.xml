		<content> There is a dense network of good roads
 in Chertsey. Just outside the section 
 is the M25 London Orbital Motorway    
 giving fast connections with all      
 routes from London. The nearest       
 interchange with the M3, which runs   
 to the north of the block, is at      
 Thorpe. It leads west to Southampton  
 and east to London. The M25 links the 
 M3 with the A3 at Wisley. St. Peter's 
 Way is a new road connecting          
 Addlestone and Chertsey to the M25.   
 Areas of congestion in the locality   
 are at Chertsey Bridge and Hatch Farm 
 Roundabout. Heriot Road has helped to 
 relieve congestion in the Town Centre,
 as Sainsbury's car park has increased 
 parking facilities and Guildford      
 Street has been made a one-way street.
