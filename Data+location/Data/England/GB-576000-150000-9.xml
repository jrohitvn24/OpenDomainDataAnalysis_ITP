		<content> Most of this small village sits on top
 of the Greensand ridge overlooking the
 Weald of Kent to the south, though    
 there are some houses down the slope. 
 The older dwellings tend to be        
 timber-framed and weather-boarded.    
 There are some private houses around  
 little closes, and also a large area  
 of council houses on the west of the  
 village. A few of the latter are      
 examples of the post-war              
 pre-fabricated Airey houses which were
 not supposed to last for long, but    
 people are still living in them. The  
 village is well looked after and the  
 gardens pretty. There is a Post Office
 which is also a general store, a pub  
 called the 'Buffalo', and an          
 off-licence. Nearby, to the west, is a
 large house called Amberfield which   
 stands adjacent to the old Rochester  
 to Hastings Roman road.               </content>
