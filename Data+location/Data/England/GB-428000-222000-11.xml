		<content>  The Women's Institute of 24 members  
 meet monthly in the Village Hall.     
 The WI is involved in village life and
 helps most of the charity events.     
  The Mother's Union, attached to the  
 church holds monthly meetings around  
 the village.   Current projects are   
 to provide a caravan for deprived     
 families, and arrange for prison      
 visitors to have a room in Oxford.    
  The Cricket Club plays here most     
 summer weekends, against other local  
 teams.                                
  The Playgroup is run for local       
 pre-school children on three mornings 
 a week in the Village Hall.           
  The Over Sixty Club meets            
 fortnightly, and the members play     
 Bingo, etc. and have the odd outing.  
  The Wolf Cubs, for boys of 7-11, meet
 weekly.   They take part in scouting  
 activities.                           </content>
