		<content> The Amenity Area was built by         
 Clyst                                 
 Hydon Parish Council in May 1981.The  
 river Clyst runs next to the Amenity  
 Area.There are two trees in the       
 Amenity Area and a bush.There are two 
 benches both made out of wood.There   
 are two plaques for the best kept     
 village next to the trees.A wooden    
 fence surrounds the Amenity Area.The  
 grass in the Amenity Area is cut      
 every two months.                     
                                       
 There are 3 buses and 2 mini buses    
 that travel through Clyst Hydon.They  
 come every day apart from Sunday.On   
 Thursdays and Fridays they only come  
 in the afternoon.Sometimes the buses  
 make small trips like from the Merry  
 Harriers to the bus stop which is near
 the Amenity Area.
