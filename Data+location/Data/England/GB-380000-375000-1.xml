		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF CHELFORD</title>
		<content> Our area is a rural area  close to    
 Knutsford and Macclesfield. The main  
 employment in the area is farming. The
 housing has increased in the last ten 
 years with the building of a new      
 housing estate. It also includes some 
 of the older part of the village of   
 Chelford.                             
   Also in the area are parts of Nether
 Alderley and Great Warford. Great     
 Warford has a lot of land belonging to
 the David Lewis Epileptic Centre and  
 the Mary Dendy Homes for people with  
 mental illnesses.                     
   Chelford has a general market and a 
 cattle market which serves the local  
 farming community and a larger        
 surrounding area.                     
   Everyone we spoke to enjoyed living 
 in this area and thought it a         
 beautiful place to live.
