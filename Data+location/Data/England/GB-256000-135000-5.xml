		<content>  In 1985, there are quite a number of 
 clubs and social activities in the    
 district of Shirwell.  There is a     
 Women's Institute which meets at the  
 village hall monthly on a Tuesday     
 evening.  An annual subscription is   
 paid, half of which goes towards the  
 cost of running county and national   
 headquarters.  In Shirwell, country   
 crafts are particularly encouraged.  A
 member is sent each year to the Annual
 General Meeting in London to vote on  
 motions according to the wishes of    
 Shirwell's Institute.                 
   The Shell Group is a club for       
 children which meets at the Methodist 
 Chapel in an evening.  Games are      
 played and handicraft work is taught. 
 Sometimes there are displays.         
   During the Summer months, a         
 playscheme is often operated for the  
 younger members of the community.     </content>
