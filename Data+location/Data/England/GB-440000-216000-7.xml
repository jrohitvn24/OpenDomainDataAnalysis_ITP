		<title>07AKEMAN STREET</title>
		<content>Akeman Street is the course of an old  
Roman road which runs from one side    
of our area to the other.              
Akeman Street forms part of the        
Oxfordshire way and runs through       
Stonesfield steps, Littleworth farm,   
Akeman Street Farm, Blenheim park and  
near the site of a Roman Villa. A Roman
coin which was found 1911 may be       
something to do with the roman         
road. The man in charge at Akeman      
Street Farm said that he did not mind  
Akeman Street running through his farm 
because it does not get very many      
people walking along it.
