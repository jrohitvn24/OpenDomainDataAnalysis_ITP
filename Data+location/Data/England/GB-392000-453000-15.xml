		<content> Matters under recent consideration    
 have included:-                       
{Travelling People}-These came and     
 settled on {Low Green}and caused a    
 mess with the scrap metal they were   
 collecting. Last year posts had to be 
 put round{Middle Green} to discourage 
 them. Now some way has to be found to 
 keep them off Low Green.              
{B.M.X.Track}-To be built on the{      
{Playing Field}(provided by the{       
{Coulthurst Trust}) for an experimental
 period of six months.

 Motor Bikes, Dog dirt, Street Lighting
