   Within the area the majority of     
 households have two working adults.   
 This explains why there is a          
 predominance of expensive cars in the 
 area. These are used for travelling to
 and from work.{The majority of        
{people are employed in the area.      
                                       
   In households where there is only   
 one working adult there are usually   
 children who have to be looked after. 
 This means one adult will stay at home
 to look after them,{this is not       
{necessarily the woman.                
                                       
   The adult who remains at home often 
 has a car as well and this is used for
 shorter trips such as shopping and    
 taking the children to school. This   
 car is usually an inferior one than   
 that used for work.                   </content>
