		<content>{THE POST OFFICE}                      
     The Post Office in New Hartley is 
 open almost every day. The owners like
 living here, the shop is of average   
 size and they get quite a lot of      
 customers. The shop does not need any 
 improvements, but it would be better  
 if the{Paper Hut}was with the rest of 
 the shops.
