		<content> Most of the land in this block is     
 owned by the Weld family. They have   
 been Squires since 1641 and are an old
 and distinguished Roman Catholic      
 family. Since Humphrey Weld purchased 
 the Estate the family have played a   
 prominent part in local affairs.      
 The present family seat, Lulworth     
 Castle, lies to the East of the block.
 It is from there that the Estate is   
 managed.                              
 Colonel Sir Joseph Weld, O.B.E., T.D. 
 is the present head of the family. He 
 was, for many years, Lord Lieutenant  
 of Dorset.                            
 The Estate currently extends to       
 approximately 5,040 hectares within   
 the Civil Parishes of Chaldon         
 Herring, East and West Lulworth,      
 Winfrith Newburgh and Wool. It is     
 administered by a Board of Trustees.
