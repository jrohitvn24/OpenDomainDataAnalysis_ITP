		<content> Buying food and eating habits have    
 changed a lot.Our results show that   
 57% buy in supermarkets,15% in        
 separate shops.Average prices in      
 supermarkets today and how they would 
 be in 50 years,inflation taken at 5%  
 per annum are shown below:            
 Brown bread 44p,Â£4.81 Sugar 47p,Â£5.38 
 1lb Apples 62p,Â£7.10 Chicken 72p Â£8.25
 pint Milk 21p,Â£2.40 6 Eggs 50p,Â£5.73  
 Tea Â£1.15,Â£13.18.                     
 Convenience foods are eaten by 15%    
 population,60% eat fresh.A vegetarian 
 diet adhered to by 5% population.We   
 noticed a marked increase in          
 convenience foods but a large         
 percentage of the population still eat
 healthily probably in response to     
 publicity persuading people to look   
 after their bodies and to eat healthy 
 foods.
