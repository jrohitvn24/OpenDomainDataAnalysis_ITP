		<title>20FRUIT FARMING</title>
		<content> A big percentage of the apples and    
 pears grown at Mockbeggar are stored  
 in large cold stores for up to three  
 months.                               
   Mockbeggar also grows a lot of soft 
 fruit such as strawberries,rasberries,
 gooseberries and they have a very big 
 'Pick your own' part to the farm as   
 well as their own Farm Shop.Straw is  
 also used extensively with the        
 strawberry crop and they use special  
 machines for laying the straw under   
 the plants.Polythene is also used to  
 protect the young fruit plants from   
 the frost.                            
           Acknowedgments              
 THanks to the children of CLass M at  
 Chattenden CP School for the research 
 work. To Lt.Col Fawcus 12 RSME, Maj.  
 Alexander PR&amp;A, Maj.Hogben EODTIC,
