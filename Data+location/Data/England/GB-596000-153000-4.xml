		<title>04THROWLEY SCHOOL CLOSURE</title>
		<content> When Mr J.E.C.Viner, our last         
 headmaster, got another headship in   
 Rochester, the Kent County Council    
 looked into the future of the school. 
 12th September 1984 - the schools sub-
 committee recommended the closure of  
 Throwley school to the County Council.
 8th October 1984 - the full education 
 committee decided to close Throwley   
 school.                               
 26th October 1984 - The closure notice
 was issued and displayed outside the  
 school.                               
 The parents and friends, as well as   
 the governors both prepared detailed  
 reports supporting the school, through
 a lot of evening meetings. An appeal  
 was then sent to the Minister.        
 3rd June 1985 - It was announced that 
 the appeal had been rejected by Sir   
 Keith Joseph. Throwley school closes  
 at the end of this term.              </content>
