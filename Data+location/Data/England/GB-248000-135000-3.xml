		<title>03St Brannock's Church.</title>
		<content> Brannock decided to build a church in 
{550}A.D.He started work on the top of 
 a hill over looking the present       
 church. His men started work, and the 
 legend says that every time he built  
 it, it kept falling down the hill,so  
 he gave up and started to build it on 
 flat land .The church you see today   
 was built by the year{1300}.About     
 another 300 years later{a Ms Deborah  
{Keene}was buried: she was probably the
 first person to be buried in the      
 graveyard. Over{3000}people attend    
 church in a year,and it costs over    
{Â£21,000}to run it.The ages of people  
 going to church are spread between the
 youngest babies and the eldest        
 pensioners.The vicar when             
 interviewed,said that his job was     
 rewarding (but not in the sense of    
 money) and that he likes teaching     
 people about Jesus.                   </content>
