		<title>05SHOPPING IN THE CLUNTON AREA</title>
		<content> The block is sadly devoid of shops.   
 Although Clunton is a fairly large    
 village it's shop has been closed for 
 over a year because it wasn't         
 financially viable. It is possible    
 however to buy goat's milk and cheese 
 from the Goat Farm in Clunton and     
 no-one need ever be short of an egg as
 several people have boards advertising
 the sale of free range eggs. In       
 addition it is possible to buy        
 ice-cream and homemade jam from Bush  
 Farm which is a small but popular     
 caravan site.                         
    On Friday the postmistress from    
 Hopesay holds a Post Office at the    
 Crown Inn at Clunton which saves many 
 pensioners and the odd Mum the journey
 to the nearest office two miles away. 
 It also acts as a meeting place for   
 people who might not otherwise see one
 another all week.                     </content>
