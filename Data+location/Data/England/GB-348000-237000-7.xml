  There are 3 main Catholic churches   
 in or near Hereford.{Our Lady's}is a  
 small, modern building served by      
{Vincentian Fathers.}Our school is     
 attached to it.{St. Francis Xavier's  
 is an old building in the city centre 
 but the school is a mile away.        
{Belmont Abbey,}2 miles away, is a     
{Benedictine Monastery}where young men 
 may train for the priesthood. The     
 monks run a very famous public school.
   Polish people may go to the church  
 run by the{Marian Fathers}at Lower    
 Bullingham. They have very,very long  
 sermons in Polish!                    
    We have a Convent of{Poor Clares,  
 an enclosed order of nuns, which one  
 of our teachers entered. There is also
 a Convent of the{Sisters of Charity.  
    I go to Belmont Abbey where I am   
 a server.                             </content>
