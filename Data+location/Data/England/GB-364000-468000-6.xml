		<title>06FARMING IN BENTHAM</title>
		<content> The sector lies in the Wenning Valley 
 in undulating countryside. The farms  
 are small carrying mostly dairy cattle
 and sheep. Most pasture land is       
 improved and used for silage and hay. 
 Store cattle and lambs are kept and   
 one battery hen farm lies at Dumb     
 Toms. An Auction Mart is held at      
 Bentham every Wednesday, serving farms
 within a radius of twenty miles. The  
 Auction building was erected in 1903  
 but a market has been in existence in 
 Bentham since 1306. Fat sheep and     
 cattle, calves and dairy cattle are   
 sold each Wednesday and special sales 
 of store lambs, breeding sheep and    
 store cattle take place between August
 and November, mostly on Saturdays.    
 Annual prize shows are held for fat   
 stock and dairy cattle and in June an 
 annual horse fair creates a local     
 spectacle.                            </content>
