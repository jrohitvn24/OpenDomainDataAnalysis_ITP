		<title>12HOUSE OF DESPINA</title>
		<content>  This business is named after the     
managers wife,Despina and has now been 
going for over eight years.They        
manufacture all sorts of toiletries.   
Handcreams,lotions and soaps are just a
few of them.They buy porcelain         
containers which they then fill.       
  The manager doesn't sell his products
in the House Of Despina or straight to 
the shops but to the wholesalers.      
  They have a childrens section called 
Bianca.This is named after the managers
child.Quite a lot of new mixed scents  
(several flowers and herbs)are named   
after the managers family.             
  The manager specializes in herbs and 
dried flowers which are imported       
separately from countries all over the 
world e.g.Africa,Egypt,China etc.      
  He then mixes the pot pourris himself
and names them.These are then exported 
to over 56 countries.                  </content>
