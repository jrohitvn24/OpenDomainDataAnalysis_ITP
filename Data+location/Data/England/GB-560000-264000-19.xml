		<title>19 BRICKFIELD STUD, EXNING</title>
		<content>We went to visit a local stud. It      
covers an area of 87 acres. As well as 
the American-style stables there are   
offices, sitting-up rooms and workers' 
houses. The owner has his own house,   
garden and tennis court.  There are no 
stallions at this stud. The mares are  
sent away to other establishments to be
covered, quite often to Ireland. This  
breeding season they had 8 fillies and 
6 colts but sadly 2 colts died. In the 
winter the mares stay in the stables   
but in the summer they graze in the    
paddocks. The hay is imported from     
America because it is much richer in   
protein. The yearly bill for hay is at 
least 15,000 pounds. The stud employs 8
men. They work from 7.00am to 7.00pm in
the summer but finish work at 5.00pm in
the winter.
