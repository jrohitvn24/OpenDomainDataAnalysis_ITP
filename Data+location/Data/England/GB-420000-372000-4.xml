		<title>04Calver to Hassop.</title>
		<content> The B.6001 road, which leads uphill   
 out of Calver village, is on the edge 
 of a hill and subject to subsidence.  
 Formerly there was a mine above the   
 road which conveyed waste down into   
 the valley, where there were tailings 
 lagoons but now these are grassed     
 over.                                 
 Hassop Avenue itself is tree-lined,   
 with mature and aging trees, now being
 replaced by the Park Authority. On the
 upper side of it is a works on the    
 site of an old mine, which extracts   
 and processes minerals, especially    
 barytes for use on the North Sea Oil  
 Rigs.
