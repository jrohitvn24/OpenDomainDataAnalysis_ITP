		<title>18PROJECT HQ. - HEDINGHAM</title>
		<content>   In March 1983, a committee was      
 formed with the intention of raising  
 funds to build a Group Headquarters   
 for the Scouts, Guides, Brownies and  
 Cubs in the area. A local farmer      
 leased them a plot of land on the     
 outskirts of the village. This        
 included a derelict cart lodge which  
 has been renovated and is now being   
 used for storage. A total of Â£7,500   
 has been raised so far, the concrete  
 base has been laid for the new meeting
 hall, and all the drainage work has   
 been done. It is estimated that a     
 further Â£5,000 will be needed to      
 complete the project. The committee   
 try to organise a fund-raising event  
 each month. The site work is done by  
 men through the Manpower Services     
 Commission.                           
   Over 100 children will ultimately   
 benefit from this community project.  </content>
