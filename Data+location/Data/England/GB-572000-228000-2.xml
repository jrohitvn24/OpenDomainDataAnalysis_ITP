{W.I.}(p18-20). About 15% replied and  
 the following picture emerged. Of 100 
 adults living in 41 houses, 23 are    
 pensioners.  There are 30 children    
 under 16. 46 people have paid         
 employment; a small majority working  
 within 15 miles of home. Almost all   
 houses are owner occupied. 34 homes   
 have pets - dogs and cats being most  
 popular. More than half the families  
 have relatives within 15 miles. Only 3
 households have no private transport. 
 About half use local buses and a few  
 use trains. Almost all use the{village
{shop}but get their main provisions in 
{Braintree,}going to larger towns for  
 special items. Most people go to      
{Braintree}to see a doctor. Some go to
