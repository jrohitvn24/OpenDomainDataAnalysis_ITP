		<title>04Sheep Farming on Horse-Eye</title>
		<content> On Horse-Eye Level, mainly a flat area
 there are 2 types of animal farming.  
 One is sheep, the other being cattle. 
 The type of sheep that graze on the   
 marshland are Southdown &amp; Romney      
 Marsh. They are reared for their wool 
 as well as for their meat. The lambing
 season in the 1980s is now anytime    
 from late autumn to mid spring. The   
 ewes are taken in during lambing time 
 in order to prevent, where possible,  
 problems arising from multiple births.
 Modern day farming having to be cost  
 effective, loss of stock at birth - 3 
 lambs being not unusual - cannot be   
 tolerated. Depending on weather       
 conditions the ewes with their new    
 lambs are turned back out on the      
 marshes anything from 24 hrs to 7 days
 after their birth. Only in very       
 extreme weather conditions are the    
 sheep taken in.                       </content>
