		<title>09THE UNDERSHAW HOTEL</title>
		<content>       THE UNDERSHAW HOTEL GOT ITS NAME
 FROM 'SHAW', AN OLD NAME FOR 'WOODED  
 GROUND'.THIS HOTEL REALLY WAS         
 SITUATED UNDER WOODED GROUND.         
  SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE LIVED IN THIS 
 HOTEL WHEN IT WAS A HOUSE. HE WROTE   
 THE STORIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND    
 WHEN HE WAS WRITING HE WOULD OFTEN TRY
 OUT THE THINGS HE WAS WRITING ABOUT.  
 E.G. HE TOOK DRUGS WHEN HE WAS WRITING
 ABOUT A DRUG ADDICT.                  
  CONAN DOYLE CAME TO HINDHEAD BECAUSE 
 AT THAT TIME HIS WIFE WAS SUFFERING   
 FROM TUBERCULOSIS, AND THE AIR IN     
 HINDHEAD WAS SAID TO BE BENEFICIAL TO 
 SUCH SUFFERERS.                       
  CONAN DOYLE'S FAMILY TREE REMAINS    
 ETCHED IN STAINED GLASS, AS DO THE    
 SPECIALLY BUILT SHALLOW STAIRS. FANS  
 OF THE WRITER, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH  
 A BELIEF IN THE SUPERNATURAL, STILL   
 HOPE TO SEE HIS GHOST HERE.           </content>
