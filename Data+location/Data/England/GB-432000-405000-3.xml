{A school day.                         
 I get up about 8 o'clock.I usually go 
 to school in black cotton and         
 polyester trousers.I set off about    
 8.45 and arrive at 8.55 when school   
 starts.I walk up three flights of     
 stairs to my classroom.At 9o'clock our
 teacher does register and then we have
 assembly where we sing and listen to  
 stories.After this we do basic maths  
 or SMP.At 10.45 we have playtime after
 which we write stories or have music  
 until dinner at 12.00.Most chldren    
 stay for dinner at school.In the      
 afternoon we do games such as football
 and rounders.We also do project or    
 topic work.We are doing a topic about 
 London because our class are visitng  
 London next week.After games or topic 
 it is usually ten minutes to four     
 which means it is time to go home.    </content>
