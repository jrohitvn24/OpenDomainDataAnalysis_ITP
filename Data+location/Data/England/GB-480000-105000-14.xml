		<content>  As yet the{high unemployment}figures 
 experienced in other areas has not    
 affected this area.There has been a   
{dramatic transformation}in the type of
 employment residents have.During the  
 years between the wars the greatest   
 employment was connected with the     
 land.Today a combination of           
 mechanization and mobilisation has    
 altered the situation.                
  The local{farms}now require{fewer }  
{workers}and car ownership has meant   
 workers can travel further to         
 employment.                           
  An increasing number of residents    
 work in{industry or businesses}based  
 further afield.Some even commute to   
 London daily.                         
  Although{farming}is still the{major} 
{employment}in the area the percntage  
 of residents working on the land is   
 low.                                  </content>
