		<content> From having no main services at all a 
 generation ago, all the houses now    
 have electricity and mains water.     
 Along the main road the houses are    
 connected to the gas main, but down   
 the lanes away from the A48 people use
 bottled gas or none. Waste water runs 
 to septic tanks to decompose and      
 purify before seeping away through the
 earth. The school shares a septic tank
 with the next-door house which used to
 be the headmaster's house but is now  
 privately owned. We have a weekly     
 refuse collection from the Forest of  
 Dean depot. The telephone is          
 universally available. The only public
 buildings in the area are our primary 
 school and a village hall; churches,  
 chapels and two more village halls are
 in adjoining blocks.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
