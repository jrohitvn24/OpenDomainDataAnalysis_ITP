		<title>02 A Dairy Farm.</title>
		<content> John Kingston of Home Farm has 150    
acres all grassland.He has 140 cows of 
which only 90 are in milk at any one   
time.Breeds include Ayrshire,Fresian   
and crossbreed Herefords.Mr Kingston   
is unique in that he sells much of his 
milk in the village,and 1600 pints to  
the MMB at Oxford.Each cow produces 4  
gallons daily.He only has a dairy herd.
He prefers to breed his own            
replacements.He has 16 fields, 9 of    
which are for grazing and 7 are laid   
for hay.Hay is used for winter feeding 
when the cows are kept in the yard.    
He acquires straw bales from           
neighbouring farms because he does not 
grow any corn himself.To supplement    
the hay during  the winter,he feeds    
the beasts with a  special cake        
supplied by the BOCM of Basingstoke.   
Each cow receives about half a bucket  
full  a day.                           </content>
