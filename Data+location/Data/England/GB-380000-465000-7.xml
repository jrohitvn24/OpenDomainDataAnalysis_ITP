		<title>07A FARM IN STAINFORTH (1)</title>
		<content> Farming is the major industry in this 
 area. Like most other farms around    
 here, this one is mixed. It is mainly 
 dairy, having about 70 Fresian cows   
 (though the number being milked varies
 throughout the year). There are also  
 about 200 sheep, 20 hens and 3 working
 dogs. The farm landscape consists     
 mainly of pasture land and meadowland.
  In summer, some of the meadowland is 
 mown for silo and the rest for hay.   
 There is some rough land which is     
 grazed by sheep. Most of the farm     
 buildings are nucleated round the     
 farmhouse, except for a couple of hay 
 barns which are in the meadows, but   
 these are used a lot less than they   
 used to be. The buildings in the farm 
 yard consist of a barn, a couple of   
 shippons and a new milking complex    
 which was built only last year.
