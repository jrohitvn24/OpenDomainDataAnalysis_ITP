		<title>06KEMPSEY'S POLICE STATION.</title>
		<content>   Kempsey is a large village of 3000  
 people. Although there is little crime
 a police officer is still needed.The  
 P.C. Brooks is the only regional      
 constable and has a lot of work on    
 'petty' crimes. The police station in 
 Kempsey is in fact one room attached  
 to a house and has only been there for
 40 years. There is nowhere to deal    
 with very serious offenders who are   
 taken to Worcester where they are     
 detained before they come before the  
 courts. Involvement with Worcester    
 Division is rare and prevented        
 whenever possible.                    
   The constable has a 16 hour working 
 day which consists of paper-work,     
 calls and regular visits to the local 
 primary school. He sees his job of    
 being one of community policing rather
 than simply appearing to do a job in  
 an emergency.                         </content>
