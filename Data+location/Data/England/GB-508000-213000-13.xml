		<content> 1 {ANNABLES MANOR}- this house was    
 built by a family called Kynnsbourne. 
 Only the foundations are original and 
 in the garden is a sixteenth century  
 wall.  The farm connected to the manor
 was originally a dairy farm but in    
 1962 was converted to cereals with    
 some animals.  The farm has a donkey  
 wheel used for grinding corn.         
 2 {BYLANDS}- was built in 1700 and    
 underneath the house are tunnels used 
 by the monks of St Albans Abbey to    
 escape when necessary.  The house has 
 both oil and solar heating.  It has a 
 rare plant, a snake fritillary in the 
 garden.                               
  Generally the housing in the area is 
 Victorian with some which is very     
 recent as in the expanding area of    
 new, private houses in north-west     
 Harpenden.
