		<title>10Why I like Bakewell</title>
		<content>     Bakewell is a very nice place to  
 live in. There are beautiful flowers  
 in {Bath  Gardens, }and  I  see  the  
 gardener  there  every  day  of  the  
 week,  looking  after  the  flowers,  
 watering them and sometimes planting  
 new ones.                             
     Best of all I like the{fair,}but  
 it only comes  once a year.   At the  
 fair  this year there was a new ride  
 called the orbiter,  but I didn't go  
 on that because it went too fast.     
     This year I went on the cyclone,  
 the skid and the barrels of fun.      
     In Bakewell every year there are  
{Well Dressings,} and  this  year the{ 
{2nd Bakewell Brownies}did a  picture  
 of the children in Ethiopia  who are  
 starving because of a terrible drout  
 and famine.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
