		<title>15THE NUCLEAR POWER STATION</title>
		<content> The Druridge Bay beach has always been
 a refuge for birdlife and is regarded 
 as a local beauty spot. However,there 
 is a proposal which would shatter this
 tranquility, the building of a huge   
 nuclear power station immediately by  
 the dunes.When word escaped about this
 proposal a great number of people     
 were extremely shocked,while a lesser 
 number support this idea. The many    
 opposers to the power station have    
 staged many controversial protest     
 marches and they have also sent       
 petitions to Alan Beith (our local    
 M.P)and parliament.Most of the        
 protesters argue their case on the    
 grounds of destruction of the         
 enviroment,and possible dangers to the
 health of the local people.
