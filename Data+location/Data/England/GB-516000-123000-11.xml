		<content> The{clay soils}in this block can be   
 used to support most types of farming.
 The{arable}tends to be on the west    
 side of the block and the{livestock   
 farming in the east. It is a{breeding 
 area for cattle, deer, llama and game 
 birds. The arable farming is highly   
 mechanised and it is a rush to        
 harvest, plough and replant before    
 the soil becomes too wet to work. Once
 a crop is established it does well    
 because the clay holds the moisture in
 dry spells. The smaller farms are     
 taken over by{smallholders}who, with  
 their families manage to make a       
 living. There are two developments    
 which might change farming patterns   
 and these are: the introduction       
 of{organic farming}(at Belmordean) and
 the imposition of the uncertainties of
{EEC milk quotas}- several farms are   
 finding profitability handicapped.    </content>
