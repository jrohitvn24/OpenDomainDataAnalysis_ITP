		<title>01Fertile Land Near Tollerton</title>
		<content> This area is flat agricultural land,  
 part of the fertile Vale of York. The 
 farming is mainly cereal and          
 vegetables with a small amount of     
 livestock. The east coast main railway
 line crosses this section as does the 
 A19 trunk road from York to the NE. On
 the eastern edge of the section there 
 are small woods and coppices, all that
 remains of the ancient Forest of      
 Galtres. The land is well drained by  
 ditches passing the streams into the  
 River Kyle and then to the River Ouse.
 A new pipeline distributing natural   
 gas has recently been laid alongside  
 the A19 road. There are farms and     
 small-holdings scattered across this  
 section.
