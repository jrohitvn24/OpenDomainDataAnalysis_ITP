		<title>16PRINTER MANAGER</title>
		<content> My father's occupation is printing.   
 He works for Bowaters which is a firm 
 on the Faverdale industrial estate.He 
 works on the Pre-print departmant     
 known as Bow-print.He is a printing   
 machine manager on a machine named the
 Cobdan Chadwick which is one of the   
 most advanced printing machines in    
 Britain.This process of printing is an
 extremely new advancement in the      
 container industry.Before Pre-print   
 days all cartons were printed after   
 the paper was converted into the      
 cardboard which was used for making   
 the customers boxes.This form of      
 printing is known as post-corrugater  
 printing.The pre-corrugater printing  
 means that the layer of paper used  to
 make up the outside of a container  is
 printed before being made into        
 corrugated board on the corrugater    
 machine.{(Continued P.17)}            </content>
