      An independent{'bus service,     
 operating from Bromyard, goes daily to
 and from Worcester, with stops on both
 the Alfrick and Suckley Roads.  The   
 public 'bus service operates between  
 Hereford and Worcester along the      
 A4103 road.  However, the services are
 infrequent and the latest service     
 returning from Worcester is six p.m.  
 Consequently people rely heavily upon 
{private transport}and most families   
 own at least one car.                 
                                       
      The{Great Western Railway}built a
 line between Worcester and Leominster 
 and there was a station at Leigh.  It 
 fell under the 'Beeching Axe' in the  
 1960's and the line dismantled, though
 its path is still clearly evident.
