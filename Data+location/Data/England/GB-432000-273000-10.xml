		<content> The schools in the area have been     
 greatly affected by the nearness of   
 the Warwickshire County Boundary. In  
 Baginton village there was a primary  
 school,next to the church.This school 
 is now closed and the old school      
 buildings are now the church hall.The 
 schoolhouse is a  private dwelling and
 the children of the village have to be
 bussed into Kenilworth for their educa
 tion.Three schools exist in Finham,the
 Comprehensive,Finham Junior and Finham
 Infants.These were all part of Warwick
 shire until 1965 when they became part
 of the Coventry system,although still 
 geographically outside the city limit.
 In the Junior school hall there is a  
 tapestry which commemorates this event
 It shows the links by including       
 Warwick Castle and Coventry Cathedral.
 In 1986-7 the Junior and Infants will 
 combine on the site of the former.    </content>
