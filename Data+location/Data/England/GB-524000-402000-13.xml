		<content>    Many teenagers of today can be     
 seen carrying round with them personal
 stereos.Using these they listen to    
 live or taped music from the pop      
 charts which reflects the top selling 
 songs and pop groups.                 
    In addition to producing music on  
 record and tape many groups make      
 video tapes to be shown on television 
 whilst the song is played.Most        
 teenagers watch B.B.C. television's   
 programme, "Top of the Pops"to find   
 out the current"Number One"selling    
 record.                               
   The records from the charts are     
 played at discos, with flashing       
 lights,where most young people do     
 "break_dancing","robotics" and "body- 
 popping" also, some girls jazzdance.  
    The dancing includes athletic      
 movements which indicate how today's  
 people like to keep fit and healthy.  </content>
