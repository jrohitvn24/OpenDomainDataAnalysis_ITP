           BOROUGH OF CASTLE MORPETH   
 The {castle}is now in ruins,only the  
 gatehouse remains.It was lived in     
 during the reign of Charles the First.
{MORPETH}_means the town on the path   
 over the moor.It was called{Morepathia
 by the {Romans.}It has no written     
 history before the {Normans}came.{    
{Stobhill}and{Hepscott}were also parts 
 of the{De Merlay}barony,which was     
 granted rights,as a market town by    
 King John 1199.                       
{Stobhill}is at the top of the hill.   
 stob could mean a stump of a tree or a
 signpost.An old mile stone still      
 stands near the British Legion Club.It
 has always been an extension of       
 Morpeth,a place for those working in  
 the area to live .                    </content>
