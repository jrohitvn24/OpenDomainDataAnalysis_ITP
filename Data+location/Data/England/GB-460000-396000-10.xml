		<content>    There are no organised men's soccer
 teams in Rossington but there is a    
 Rossington Colts football team for    
 boys and a Station  Juniors team.     
     Most schools in Rossington have a 
 football team which competes against  
 teams from other schools.  There is a 
 men's Rugby Union team called the     
 Hornets and the team plays at the     
 Rossington Miners' Welfare Ground on  
 West End Lane.                        
     On Wednesday evenings there are   
 cricket practices and anyone can go   
 along, these practices are also at the
 Welfare Ground good players are picked
 for the Rossington Teams.             
     Fishing is also a popular sport   
 for people of all ages.  Most of the  
 pubs have darts teams for both men and
 women, snooker is also played at pubs 
 and clubs in Rossington.
