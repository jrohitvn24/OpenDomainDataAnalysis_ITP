 There are two groups of local shops   
 and a grocer.The shops are mainly food
 shops and newsagents but in Queensway 
 there are also a Post Office and a    
 hairdressers.There are two hot food   
 shops.On Wednesday when we went the   
 busiest shop in Queensway was the     
 newsagent and in the Precinct it was  
 the grocer.We went on Wednesday       
 morning and about 150 people went to  
 the Precinct and about 154 people went
 into Queensway;most people we met were
 local and travelled there by car or on
 foot.They said they came two or three 
 times a week.Many people thought the  
 litter was terrible and there were too
 many things in the windows of some    
 shops.Most people we interviewed said 
 they wanted a chemist.
