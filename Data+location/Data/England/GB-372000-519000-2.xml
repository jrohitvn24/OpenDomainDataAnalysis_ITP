		<content> Geologically the area attracts a great
 deal of attention having one of the   
 widest  age-ranges and rock types in  
 Britain. It merits its own            
 literature, described in geology of   
 the Appleby District" and the local   
 deposits of lead were one reason for  
 the development of settlement here.   
 (See local history section).          
 In geological times the area was also 
 affected by volcanic activity and     
 later glaciation, leaving dramatic    
 landforms like the nearby High Cup    
 Gill with its steep cliffs of volcanic
 whin sill and the distinctive conical 
 shape of Murton Pike. The hillsides   
 are scarred by crags of both limestone
 and sandstone, both of which have been
 quarried for building.
