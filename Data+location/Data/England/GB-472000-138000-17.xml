		<content>    Throughout its history Alton's     
 continued prosperity has relied on the
 variety of industry in the area. This 
 is still reflected in the modern{     
{Industrial and Trading Estate}which   
 was built on the low ground between   
 the railway and the river during the  
 1970's, and serves a wide range of    
 manufacturing and trading             
 requirements.                         
                                       
    The Estate is arranged in units,   
 with each block being served by       
 service roads and parking spaces.
