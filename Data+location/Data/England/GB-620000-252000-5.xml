		<title>05THE VINEYARD AT CLOPTON</title>
		<content> There is a small vineyard situated at 
 Clopton. This is a family run small   
 business started about 7 years ago.   
 The grape vines are harvested and sent
 to another local vineyard for         
 bottling. The wine is then sent back  
 to Clopton for clearing by Customs and
 Excise before being sold to a hotel.  
 This year the grapes have been very   
 poor as a result of the bad winter of 
 1984 and they will not be harvested.  
 This is the first time this has       
 happened.                             
 The family also run the local Post    
 Office from a room in their house.
