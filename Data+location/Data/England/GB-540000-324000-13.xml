{14th }Century . It has a solid stone  
 spire. The bricks probably came from  
{Hull}. It has solid stone floors and  
 the tower is about {159 }feet high.   
 It has {six }bells,and it has one of  
 the lightest peals in {England}.It    
 is white washed inside and there are  
 many tombs in the church , of old     
{important}families .The wall around   
 the grave-yard was paid for by a{     
{Mr.Putterill },  in{ 1545}.There are  
 still Putterill's living in the       
 village today. The vicar of Lutton    
 church is {Mr.Hawes }and he lives     
 in the {vicarage.                     
 The church still plays an important   
 part in village social life and many  
 different functions are organised by  
 the church for the village each year.
