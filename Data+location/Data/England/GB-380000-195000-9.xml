		<content> 32 housholders(c.45% sample) responded
 to our{housing}questionare.  These    
 consist of 28 owner-occupiers, 3      
 private tenants, no council tenants   
 (there are none), and 1 "other"       
 unspecified.  27(84%) of these houses 
 are built in Cotswold Limestone, with 
{buildings and landscape}in harmony.   
 Most houses are old, over half date   
 from the 18th and 19th c. and some    
 others are much older. The few 20th c.
 houses all post-war with significant  
 groups in the late 1960's, and        
 especially the 1980's which is        
 represented by a close of "executive" 
 detached houses and two more          
 traditional terraces.  All are stone  
 built, owner-occupied and expensive.  
 25 housholders offered"type"          
 descriptions, 10-detached, 4-semi     
 detached, 5-terraced, 3-farmhouses,   
 and 3-cottages.                       </content>
