		<title>12River Warden at Alstonfield</title>
		<content>     The job of river-warden involves  
wear repairs and construction, stocking
the river with fish, and keeping       
records of fish caught and killed etc. 
He is not responsible for the footpaths
- they are the responsibility of the   
County Councils, the Peak District     
National Park and the National Trust.  
There has been a river warden for about
50 years - so far there have been 7.   
     The River Dove has been known to  
dry up and also flood, especially after
heavy snow melts.  Axe Edge Moor in    
Derbyshire is the source of the river  
and it flows 50 miles to the River     
Trent.  The Trent flows into the sea   
at the Humber Estuary.                 
     There are about 135 members of the
fishing club who use the river.  Many  
of the fishermen return all their      
catch.  Only a few are allowed to kill 
their catch, depending on the wieght.  </content>
