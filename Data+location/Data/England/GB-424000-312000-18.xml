		<content>   Grange Wood is the largest area of  
 deciduous woodland in South           
 Derbyshire. During the second world   
 war many mature trees were felled in  
 the centre. This area has since been  
 regenerated with silver birch and     
 rhododendron. The woodland wildlife is
 much richer in the margins rather than
 in the centre. Grey squirrels are     
 common and a large active badger sett 
 is found in the north eastern corner. 
 Wood warblers, chiff chaff and willow 
 warblers are regular summer visitors. 
 Resident birds include crows, magpie, 
 jay, treecreeper, blue tit, great tit 
 and chaffinch. In spring the woodland 
 floor is carpeted with bluebells.     
 Patches of violets and primroses can  
 be found. The wood is privately owned 
 and is not managed.
