		<title>10BURGHLEY:DAIRY FARM</title>
		<content> At the dairy farm there is an old     
 stone building probably used for      
 storage.The shape of the building is  
 rectangular.The roof is thatched with 
 a window in it.The stone is very      
 old.Mr.Barnes rents the farm.It used  
 to be called the dairy farm but now   
 they have no cattle.The buildings     
 consisted of the main farm house,a    
 stone cottage,a wooden bungalow,cattle
 sheds,a thatched stable and a stone   
 barn.Then we walked through an archway
 to the gamekeepers cottage.At the     
 gamekeepers cottage there is a        
 hatchery for pheasants.We looked at   
 the incubator.The eggs have to stay in
 it for 21 days.They hatch 3 days      
 later.After they have hatched they are
 put into pens where they stay for 16  
 weeks.They are put into a big pen in  
 the wood and released into the wild.
