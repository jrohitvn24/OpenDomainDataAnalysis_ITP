     {A new housing estate} called     
Twelve Leys has just been built.  The  
first houses were finished four years  
ago.  However a newer part of the      
estate has only just been finished.    
     At present there are 65 houses on 
the estate but most of them are very   
small.  Most of the houses are big     
enough to houses four people.The       
houses consist {of 3 bedrooms, a       
bathroom, a small kitchen and          
a larage living room.}  They also have 
a small garden and a garage.           
     The vast majority of houses are   
old, there also are some concil houses.
The oldest house in the village was    
built in the {sixteenth centurey.}
