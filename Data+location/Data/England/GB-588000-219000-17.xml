		<title>17POPULAR PASTIMES.</title>
		<content> The two of  us decided to go out and  
 ask some people and children about    
 games. One old lady told us about     
 making a spinning top because her     
 parents couldn't afford to buy her one
 so she had to make her own.You take a 
 cotton reelthat becomes the middle of 
 the spinning top,you get a bit of wood
 and poke it up in the middle of the   
 cotton reel and you put a nail in.You 
 take a stick and some string and wind 
 it round and paint a decoration on    
 top. Other people played with a       
 spinning top as well.One lady played  
 hop scotch,marbles and with a         
 top when she was a girl. Some children
 liked playing football and rounders   
 and riding their bikes.Also           
 drawing,hockey,snooker,netball reading
 and board games were popular ways in  
 which children enjoyed themselves.
