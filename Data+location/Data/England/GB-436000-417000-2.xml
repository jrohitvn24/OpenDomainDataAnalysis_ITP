		<title>02The Beach Family</title>
		<content>  There are 3 people in our family:    
 Mum, Dad and myself. I go to bed at   
 9.30, Mum goes at about 10.30 and Dad 
 goes at 11.00. I get up at about 8.00,
 Mum gets up at 7.45 and Dad gets up at
 about 8.30. Saturdays my Dad's up     
 first. I have 7 uncles and aunties and
 9 cousins. Auntie Janice and Uncle    
 George live in London so I don't see  
 her very much. She comes up as much as
 possible to see the family. Uncle     
 George travels to other countries     
 taking orders. He is a representative.
 My Mum's brother, Uncle John, lives in
 France and has a son called           
 Gal'Pierre. I have never seen him but 
 I have a photograph. At school I play 
 netball, the recorder and the guitar. 
 I go on holiday with my Mum and Dad   
 except for school trips to France and 
 Hornsea.
