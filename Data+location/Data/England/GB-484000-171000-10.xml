		<title>10I.C.I JEALOTT'S HILL</title>
		<content> I.C.I. has a plant north of Bracknell 
 (the largest of its kind) at Jealott's
 Hill that discovers and develops crop 
 protection chemicals e.g. weedkillers 
 and insecticides. Innovations are     
 looked for to solve crop problems of  
 the world, this led to the            
 presentation of the Queen's Award for 
 Export. 130 chemists are continually  
 working on problem solving            
 experiments. Conservation is of such  
 importance that preservation of old   
 hedgerows and bird surveys are        
 essential work. The station brought   
 650 jobs to the area and numbers are  
 growing. Workers come from a 20ml     
 radius. It helps with the Y.T.S and   
 employs a large % of females.         
 Bus and car are the main transport    
 systems. Workers are kept happy with  
 the playing field and clubhouse.
