		<title>06Interviewing Mr. Banfield</title>
		<content> Mr. Banfield told us something about  
 the area. Nearly all of the parish was
 originally owned by the Abbots of     
 Cerne. After the dissolution of the   
 monasteries the owners of Shute Barton
 took over most of the land.There were 
 three Manors: Philliholme, Wylde Court
 and the Rectorial Manor. Lord Bridport
 owned these until the estates broke   
 up. The first church was dedicated by 
 the Bishop of Crediton. Thomas Hardy, 
 the famous author, has connections    
 with the area. Francis Kilvert, the   
 Wye diarist, spent childhood summers  
 in Hawkchurch. Charles II is reputed  
 to have sought sanctuary at Wylde     
 Court on 22nd September 1651.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
