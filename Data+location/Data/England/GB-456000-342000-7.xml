		<content> In summer I like riding my BMX bike.I 
 sometimes go on the track on the      
 Forest.Before I go I have to check my 
 brakes and chain for faults.When I get
 back I have to clean it as it gets    
 very dirty.Indoors I usually play on  
 my computer.I have lots of games.Some-
 times I watch TV or go into the garage
 to maintain my bike.In the school yard
 I usually play cricket.We use the lamp
 post as one wicket and the edge of the
 wall as the other.If the ball touches 
 the far wall it is a six and if it    
 goes over the line it is a four.Some- 
 times we play dobby ball.One person   
 tries to hit the other person with the
 ball to make them on.Some people play 
 marbles.They use the grates in the    
 yard,but everyone argues about who has
 won.
