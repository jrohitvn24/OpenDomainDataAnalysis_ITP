		<title>12Interview with Mr. Ager</title>
		<content>   Mr. Ager was a pupil at this school 
 between{1923 and 1929}and he told us a
 lot about it. In those days there was 
 only the old part of the school in use
 but there were about a 100 children   
 there. It must have been very crowded 
 because the children stayed there     
 until they were fourteen.             
    There was one big stove which the  
 teacher stood in front of (we can     
 still see the marks on the floor). Mr.
 Ager brought in a school photograph   
 from the time and all the boys were   
 wearing shorts and hob nailed boots.  
 There was no school field and much    
 less playground than there is now. The
 toilets were all outside and they     
 were only buckets and there was no    
 water - it had to be fetched.         
    There were two teachers and two    
 pupil teachers; our headteacher's aunt
 was one of these at the time.         </content>
