Most of area is rural and we visited   
the Cattle Market to see what happens  
to the cattle and sheep which can be   
seen in the fields. We went on the     
busiest day which is the last Friday   
of the month. The busiest time of the  
year is Autumn. First we saw the sheep 
being sold in a small semi circular    
ring. Some men called drovers, hit the 
sheep with sticks to get them to go    
round the ring. A man at the front     
said the prices very quickly and       
pointed at the farmers with a stick.   
The farmers bid just by nodding their  
heads or twitching a finger. The       
cattle were sold in a bigger ring. They
were weighed first. Most of the cattle 
we saw were British Friesan and the    
average cost per cow was 600 pounds.
