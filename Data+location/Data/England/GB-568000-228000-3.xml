		<title>03CROSS FARM</title>
		<content> The present owner of Cross Farm has   
 lived there since 1954.He farms 92    
 acres of land some of which is        
 tenanted. The land is used for growing
 carrots,potatoes,sugarbeet,barley and 
 wheat.The farm as well as having all  
 these crops is a pig farm.There are 3O
 sows and 3 boars.The 3O sows produce  
 on average 5OO to 6OO piglets a year  
 which are sold for fattening up.The   
 average sized litter of piglets that  
 a sow has is 7 to 15 but litters of   
 over 15 or 2O are not unknown.When a  
 sow is 6 years old it is sent off     
 to be slaughtered. The breeds of pig  
 that are reared on Cross Farm are     
 Large White and Landrace.             
  A varied selection of machinery      
 enables the owner to work the farm    
 with a minimum of extra help.
