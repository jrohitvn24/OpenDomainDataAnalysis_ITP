 I live in the White Cottage which has 
 a lounge,a kitchen,a living room,4    
 bedrooms, a bathroom, a toilet        
 downstairs, a playroom and a spare    
 room. It was built in the{16th century
 and was originally 2 small cottages.  
 Underneath the floorboards in the     
 lounge is a well. At the back of the  
 house is a 6foot wall which the       
 railway track ran along. We have about
 3/4s acre of land.                    
          {11,MAYNARD TERRACE}         
 Our house was a miner's cottage built 
 in 1900. There are 56 houses in       
 Maynard Terrace. I live in number 11. 
 They are quite small. They have 3     
 bedrooms,2 small living rooms,1       
 kitchen and 1 bathroom. Both of our   
 gardens together are approximately 1/2
 acre.
