		<content>                                       
The Parish Church of S.S. Peter and    
Paul was built around 1350 and         
overlooks the Market Place.Three       
services are held on a Sunday and one  
each day. The twelve bells are rung at 
every service. Above the North Porch   
there is a tiny room where the Priest  
used to rest. The church contains many 
artifacts from the past. A 16th century
chest contains documents and registers 
which were stored in the church for    
safe keeping and were never claimed.   
There is also a 17th century book desk 
with chains for two books. The         
Victorian West Window is in memory of  
Canon Lindsay who built St. Andrew's   
School. There are also windows         
depicting the life of Mary the mother  
of Jesus and a modern window depicting 
St. Crispin and St. Crispian, patron   
saints of shoemaking.                  </content>
