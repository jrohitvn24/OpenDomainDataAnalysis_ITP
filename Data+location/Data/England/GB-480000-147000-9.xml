 has some breakfast,usually a bowl of  
 cereal.After getting shaved,washed and
 dressed he would normally leave       
 between 7.15-7.30 depending on whether

  It is a distance of three miles to   
 dad's office building in Aldershot,at 
 which he arrives at about 8.00a.m.The 
 mornings are usually spent doing paper
 work,stopping for a mid morning coffee
 around 10.00a.m.                      
  His lunch is taken in the staff      
 resturant at 12.30-1.15p.m.The
