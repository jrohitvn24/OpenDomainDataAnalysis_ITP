		<title>11FARMERS WIFE</title>
		<content>    After lunch, this {West Torrington 
 farmer's wife  may have time for      
 wine-making, baking, or gardening, if 
 the weather is suitable. The          
 primary-school aged child is picked up
 from the school bus at 3.30pm, the    
 other children are collected from the 
 secondary-school bus at 4.20pm. Dinner
 is eaten at about 5pm, then the       
 children may need ferrying to and from
 piano lessons, gymnastics or other    
 clubs, which may be in Market Rasen,  
 eight miles away. The farmer's wife   
 may also go out to meetings or clubs, 
 such as Parent- Teacher Associations, 
 badminton, Farm Women's Group or other
 occasional meetings which may be      
 arranged in surrounding villages. She 
 will hope to get to bed shortly after 
 10pm.
