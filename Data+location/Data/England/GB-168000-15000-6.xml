		<title>06St.Rumon's cottage</title>
		<content> There are many cottages in the area   
 which are similar to this one.It is   
 about 200 years old.The walls are two 
 feet thick and are made of cob.It used
 to have a thatched roof and before the
 extension six people lived in only two
 small rooms.The ceiling has beams and 
 floorboards.There is an inglenook     
 fireplace where an old cornish range  
 used to be.In our garden there are the
 remains of another cottage in which   
 the postman lived.People thought he   
 was eccentric because he wore a       
 long,black cloak.On the deeds of our  
 cottage,the remains of the postman's  
 cottage and our neighbour's           
 house,which used to be a priory,were  
 all called Goblin's Corner!It is      
 believed the cottage gets its name    
 and the area it is in,St.Ruan,from    
 the time of the old Irish Saints.
