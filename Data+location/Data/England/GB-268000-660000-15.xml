		<title>15Viewpark Gala Week</title>
		<content>                                       
       Our gala week is all about      
getting as many people in the commun-  
ity as possible to be happy and have   
fun. The week starts off with a parade 
of decorated floats with adults and    
children dressed up. In 1985 we only   
had 3 floats.                          
      The gala queen arrives in a Rolls
Royce;her attendants come in two Mer-  
cedes. Each of the four primary sch-   
ools has a chance to provide the queen 
and attendants.                        
     Sometimes parachutists drop in.   
The main attraction is the fun- fair   
in the park. The Umbrellas and         
Speedway are popular. There are sta-   
lls where you can throw darts or sh-   
oot and win a goldfish or teddy-bear.  
Next year,1986, will be our school's   
turn for the queen and attendants.
