 Sharnfold Cottage is a nice home      
 because i can walk across the fields  
 and i like it .Ican get strawberries  
 from over the road because there is a 
 pick-your-own-fruit opposite us.We    
 have two horses and two stables and a 
 paddock for the horses along the side 
 of the house.We have six little chicks
 and a hen.I have a cat called sooty,my
 sister has a cat called fluff and my  
 mum and dad have a cat called         
 skippy.Our house was built by         
 labourers from Preisthaws Farm.I think
 next-door was built at the same time.I
 like living in the country because it 
 is quiet and calm unlike the busy town
 .I wish we could have a village shop  
 instead of haveing to go into town.
