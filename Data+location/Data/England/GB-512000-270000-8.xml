		<content>  Ellington Gala is held every year.A  
  barbecue and fun-fair type           
 amusements are set up,and novelty     
 races.The  funds raised are put       
 towards village facilities.E.g. Swings
 and slides for the playing-field and  
 money for the  village club.A group of
 volunteers organise the gala.It has   
 been going for approximately 40 years.
 It all started in the garden of a     
 longstanding villager.It then expanded
 and moved to the village green.Another
 local festival is the Spaldwick flower
 festival.Flowers are aranged around   
 the church and a painting competition 
 is held.The church is open to the     
 public and the festival is held in    
 September.The festival may have       
 originated from the St.James patron   
 festival.
