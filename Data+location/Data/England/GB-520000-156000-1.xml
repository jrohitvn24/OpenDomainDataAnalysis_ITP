		<content>     The area covered by our three     
 schools contains many varied          
 features. Much of it is{residential   
 with examples of large individual     
 houses, suburban 'semis', large       
 council estates and 'high rise'       
 blocks of flats.                      
     There are also large areas of     
{open public space}in particular,      
{Epsom Downs}which are used for        
 many open-air leisure pursuits.       
     Dominating the Downs is{Epsom     
{Race Course,}and several of our       
 pages are used to describe{Derby      
{Day }and it's effects on the local    
 environment.                          
     We have also covered{Tadworth     
{Village Week}and the{Tadworth         
{Court Children's Hospital,}recently   
 saved from closure by public support.
