		<content> Here are some of the games played by  
 children at Landulph School during    
 lesson breaks at mid-morning,lunchtime
 and mid-afternoon.                    
 Red Letter.The game starts with a     
 number of children with their backs to
 a wall,facing a single child who is   
 also backed to a wall.The idea is to  
 cross the space inbetween by jumps    
 without jumping when the red          
 letter,nominated at the start, is     
 called.                               
 Ball It.The game starts when someone  
 is chosen to be IT.The person who is  
 IT has a ball and has to throw it at  
 the other players.If they are hit they
 become IT and have to throw the ball. 
 Urki. This is the name of someone who 
 counts to 200 while the others run off
 to hide. When Urki leaves the Urki    
 Post to look for them they have to try
 and touch the Post before being seen .</content>
