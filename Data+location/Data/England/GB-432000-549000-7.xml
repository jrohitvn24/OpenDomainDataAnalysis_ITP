		<content> Houghton quarry is a magnesian        
 limestone &amp; sand quarry on Miller's   
 Hill overlooking the town,&amp; is        
 overlooked by Newbottle village.      
 Quarrying has taken place here for    
 many years &amp; the working now covers   
 13.5 hectares (34 acres) with faces   
 about 50 metres high.It will be       
 eventually restored to about normal   
 ground level by filling it with waste 
 materials.Fieldhouse quarry is a sand 
 quarry situated to the north east of  
 the town &amp; is visible from a wide area
 to the south.The quarry is located  at
 the site of an old sand pit and while 
 working has increased in recent  years
 this is still a relativly small quarry
 occupying about 5 hectares (12 acres) 
 with working faces about 30 metres    
 high.
