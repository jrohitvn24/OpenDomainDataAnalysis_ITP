		<content> My mum wakes me up about half past    
 seven. Sometimes I have  breakfast.   
 Then I go and get dressed. After that 
 it's  time to go for the taxi.        
 When I arrive at school I have about  
 ten mintues play. At nine o'clock we  
 go in the hall and have assembly. A   
 group of us play recorders. Soon it's 
 time for maths, followed by English.  
 After that we go out to play.         
 Sometimes we do reading in a morning. 
 Often we have radio or television     
 broadcasts. Soon comes dinner, I have 
 sandwiches most children have dinners,
 cooked in the school kitchen. After   
 dinner play-time soon ends. Back in   
 school we do a number of things,      
 French, science, art, topic or perhaps
 swimming, P.E. or baking.             
 School ends at 3.30pm. At home I watch
 television, have tea, then play until 
 my mum calls me for bed.              </content>
