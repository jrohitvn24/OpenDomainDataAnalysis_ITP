 The final example of a local employer 
 is far more traditional. {FROMEBRIDGE 
{MILL}is a flour mill that was         
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Book. The mill employs two men, one to
 run the office and another to load and
 unload lorries and run the mill       
 itself. The mill buys oats, barley,   
 wheat and maize in bulk from farmers  
 and grind it to sell as food for      
 horses, chickens and cattle. Farmers  
 can also take their own cereals there 
 to be ground for use on their own     
 farms.                                
                                       
 The mill is still driven by water     
 power from a weir on the river Frome. 
 The water power used to run a cider   
 press at the mill as well.
