		<title>17OUR SURVEY IN CLAYPOLE</title>
		<content>       Our grid reference is 85,48 and 
 our teacher helped us to find it on   
 the map. We left school and walked    
 down Doddington Lane. We noticed most 
 of this part of the block was made up 
 of buildings. We were asked to notice 
 what was grown in the fields we were  
 going to survey.                      
       Mr Clark, one of our local      
 farmers met us to take us around his  
 farm. He showed us the fields and     
 talked to us about the crops. He      
 showed us different kinds of corn and 
 explained the difference between wheat
 and barley. Mr Clark has twelve fields
 most of which are arable. He also     
 showed us two dykes and explained how 
 they drained his land.                
       We left the farm, after thanking
 Mr Clark for his time, but first noted
 what was in each field so we could    
 complete the survey.                  </content>
