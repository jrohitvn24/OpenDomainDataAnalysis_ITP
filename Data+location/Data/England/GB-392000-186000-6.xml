		<title>06Industries in Malmesbury #1</title>
		<content>    The three main industries in       
 Malmesbury are{T.M.C.,Linolite and Lux
{Traffic Controls.                     
    T.M.C. stands for Telephone        
 Manufacturing Company. It employs 400 
 people who work in telecommunications,
 and make things like telephones,      
 terminals and some small business     
 exchanges. During the second world    
 war, Cowbridge House was chosen as a  
 good secluded site for assembling     
 "unspecified" radio equipment. In 1960
 T.M.C. was taken over by Pye, but in  
 1967 it was taken over again by       
 Phillips, an international corporation
 based in{Holland.}Little manufacturing
 now takes place in Malmesbury, which  
 is now the main centre for Phillips'  
 telecommunications research. This     
 moved recently from Dulwich near      
 London, and has created a great many  
 jobs in Malmesbury.                   </content>
