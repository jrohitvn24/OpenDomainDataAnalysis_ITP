 farm in the area in all 230 acres.The 
 land used to belong to Earl Spencer.On
 the farm the farmer uses a plough, two
 tractors, an old combine harvester, a 
 sprayer and a seed planter.When the   
 farmers father died 5 people worked on
 the farm. Until recently he was there 
 on his own but now he has a helper who
 is working for 5 months on a youth    
 training schene. Sandridgebury farm is
 an arable farm. The farmer also owns  
 Sandridgebury Stables and 75% of his  
 money comes from farming and the other
 25% was from the stables. On his farm 
 he grows winter barley, winter wheat  
 and oilseed rape, next year he is     
 going to grow peas for protein. As the
 EEC quota system is limiting their    
 production,the farmer thinks in future
 they will have to provide leisure     
 activities such as riding stables.    </content>
