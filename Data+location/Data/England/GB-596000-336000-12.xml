		<content> The village has easy access to much of
 the North Norfolk Coast,providing one 
 has a car. Within the village there is
 a playing field for use as a cricket  
 pitch. Formerly there were also two   
 football teams. These are unlikely    
 to be revived as so many houses are   
 only used at weekends or in the summer
 and the resident population can no    
 longer provide enough young men to    
 make up the teams.                    
  There is a flourishing bowls club.   
  Outside the village it is possible to
 sail, play golf and fly light         
 aircraft.                             
  The Gallows sports centre at Fakenham
 provides additional facilities for the
 residents who are able to travel using
 their own transport.                  
  Recreational evening classes at      
 Fakenham and Wells are also used by   
 the people in the village.            </content>
