		<content> At the Gala in the recreation field   
 each summer we have a Gala Queen and  
 attendants who lead the parade up     
 through the village into the          
 recreation field where we are met by  
 the opener. The opener has to crown   
 the Queen and give them all a present.
 The Queen gives out the prizes to the 
 competition and games winners and     
 helps to draw the raffle. All the     
 girls in the junior class have their  
 names put in a bag at the May Day Pie 
 Supper in school and the first name   
 out is the Queen. They do the same in 
 the infant class and two names are    
 drawn out for the Queen's attendants. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
