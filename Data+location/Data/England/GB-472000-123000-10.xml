		<title>10PETERSFIELD MARKET</title>
		<content> There has been a weekly market in     
 Petersfield almost since the town     
 began about 800 years ago.  Nowadays  
 there are stalls that sell clothes,   
 food, toys, materials and antiques.   
 There are more food stalls than       
 anything else, and especially fruit   
 and vegetables.  The market is held in
 the Square and at first it was a      
 cattle market, but this stopped in the
 1960s.  The market is on Wednesdays   
 and Saturdays. It starts at about 8.00
 a.m. and goes on till 6.00 p.m.  The  
 market sells quite cheap things. The  
 cheapest stall is the 50p stall. It   
 sells a lot of different things all   
 for 50p.  Usually on a Saturday there 
 is an ice cream van there.  The stalls
 do good business with all the people  
 coming in from the surrounding        
 villages to do their shopping.
