		<title>18THE VILLAGE OF SHREWTON.</title>
		<content> The housing in the village varies in  
 age, style and size. The oldest       
 residences include Maddington Grange, 
 Maddington Manor, Shrewton Manor, and 
 the Old School House which all date   
 back to the seventeenth century. Later
 buildings include attractive cottages,
 along the High Street, made of chalk  
 mud and rubble, or brick and flint.   
  The Flood cottages were built after  
 the Great Till Flood of January 1841, 
 when thirty houses were destroyed and 
 three people died.                    
  Tanners Lane has been redeveloped    
 during the past thirty-five years, the
 old cottages being replaced by more   
 modern, privately-owned, dwellings.   
  Other developments since the Second  
 World War include a large council     
 estate built in 1957 called Furlong   
 Way. Meadway, a private housing       
 estate, was built in 1968.            </content>
