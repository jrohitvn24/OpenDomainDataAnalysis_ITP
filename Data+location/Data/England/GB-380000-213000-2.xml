		<title>02Why live in Tuffley?</title>
		<content>  A number of people were asked what   
 they found particularly attractive    
 about the area. By far the commonest  
 reasons for liking Tuffley are: the   
 handiness of amenities, being close to
 the city and to the countryside at the
 same time, and being a quiet, friendly
 area with a community spirit. The     
 amenities referred to, were listed as 
 good schools for all ages from 5 to   
 18, adequate shops, sports centre,    
 dentists, good bus services and good  
 housing. Other features which are     
 appreciated are Robinswood Hill and   
 the absence of pollution.             
  On the other hand, concern is felt   
 about the poor state of repair of the 
 roads and footpaths, the increasing   
 volume and speed of traffic and the   
 apparent lack of activities for young 
 people.
