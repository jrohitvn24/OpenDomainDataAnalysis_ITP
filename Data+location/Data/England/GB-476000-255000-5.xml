		<title>05 Simpson Barracks, Wootton.</title>
		<content>  The barracks and surrounding land    
covers quite a large area on the       
northern edge of Wootton village. It   
is the main training establishment for 
recruits to the Royal Pioneer          
Corps.The recruits can join the Army   
when they leave school and may leave   
again when they are 22. The officers   
can start at the same age but may stay 
on until they are 45.                  
   The barracks was built in 1942 on   
farmland. It provides quarters for     
families to live in and a mess for the 
officers.                              
   The soldiers practice with hand     
weapons on the small firing range and  
there are seven vehicles of various    
kinds for them to work with. There is  
a museum of weapons and uniforms in    
the barracks.
