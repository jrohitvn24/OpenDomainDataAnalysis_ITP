       Farms are usually between 100   
 and 300 acres. Stock-rearing (sheep,  
 beef and dairying) is predominant,    
 most crops providing animal fodder:   
 grass for grazing, silage and hay;    
 barley for animal feed and bedding.   
 Dairy cattle are commonly Friesians,  
 sometimes Jerseys. Most milk goes to  
 the cheese factory, but some farmers  
 sell milk direct to the public or make
 cream and yoghurt, feeding the skim   
 milk to the pigs. Dairy cattle,lambing
 ewes and young beef cattle are        
 normally in-wintered and fed silage,  
 hay, barley straw and crushed barley. 
 In spring the muck is spread on the   
 fields; some artificial fertilisers   
 are also used. Few labourers are used 
 as most jobs are mechanised and profit
 margins are small. Wives are often    
 active partners on the farm.          </content>
