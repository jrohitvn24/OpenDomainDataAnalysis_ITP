		<title>05Crime in N.St Ives.</title>
		<content> St.Ives is a sleepy area (previously, 
 St.Ives was called Slepe).Police      
 protect the area well.There is not a  
 great deal of major crime,although    
 recently a man was murdered at R.A.F  
 Wyton.Vandals are about the worst     
  criminals in our area,apart from the 
 occasional break-in and very          
 occasional murder.Punishment suggested
 for crimes are birch,hard labour,and  
 community work.Not many people are    
 burgled in our area.Our school has    
 been vandalised. The swimming-pool was
 ripped,and concrete. slabs have been  
 thrown in the pool.I have friends     
 whose property has been vandalised,   
 which might prove that vandals are the
 main problem in our area. Altogether  
 St.Ives is a peaceful place, except   
 for a murder. Vandals are the only    
 problem, and the problem is getting   
 worse,every week,and every year.      </content>
