		<title>04THORNDON COUNTRY PARK 1</title>
		<content> Thorndon Country Park is very large   
 covering an area of about 4 square    
 kilometres. Some parts of the park    
 have very old woodland from the time  
 of the Domesday Book 1086, when it was
 part of the Manor of West Horndon     
 belonging to the Swain of Essex. As   
 the park was once a Deer Park there   
 are some 500 or 600 year old pollarded
 oak trees. The trunk was cut above the
 reach of deer and new shoots could    
 grow without being eaten. One of the  
 trees is called {'The Crinoline Lady'.
 It has a strange skirt-like growth  at
 the base of the trunk. This may have  
 been caused by the deer rubbing the   
 velvet off their antlers against the  
 tree. The trunk had a girth of 7.30   
 metres; it took six children and one  
 grown-up to hold hands and reach right
 round it.
