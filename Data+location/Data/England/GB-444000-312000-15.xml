		<content> doctors, railway stations,bus stations
 and so on.Quite a few of the fields   
 were kept as enclosed rough grazing   
 land although a few towards the       
 extreme S.E. corner were used for     
 crops such as barley.Everwhere is     
 covered in fields,woodland and        
 vegetation of some kind or other.We   
 passed one Inn on our survey (The     
 Bull's Head) and nine farms:Pettifor's
 Farm,Rise Rocks Farm,Burch Hill Farm, 
 Charley Mill Farm,Greenhill Lodge Farm
 ,Upper Greenhill Farm, Irish Farm and 
 Kellam's Farm_although not all of them
 are still fully working farms.We also 
 noticed that our area is well covered 
 by signposted footpaths all of which  
 are obviously frequently used by local
 people.
