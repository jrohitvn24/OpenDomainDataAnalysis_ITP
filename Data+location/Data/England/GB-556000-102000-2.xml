		<title>02HOUSES IN WILLINGDON</title>
		<content>   Most of the older houses are in     
 Church Street where flint has been    
 used quite extensively. A terrace     
 opposite St. Mary's Church has three  
 types of flint facing _ pebbles,      
 random and square. The dates 1611 and 
 1857 are carved there.                
   In Upper Willingdon, described by   
 Estate Agents as "Olde Worlde Village 
 of Willingdon",panels of flint feature
 as decorative motifs in more recently 
 built houses, and care has been taken 
 to conform to existing dwellings.     
   The area as a whole contains a good 
 mixture of housing stock.             
   Of the newest houses to be built    
 those at Willingdon Trees are         
 lower_cost type and more modern in    
 style.At Haystoun a group of          
 higher_priced detached houses is      
 nearing completion.                   
   Very little building land remains.  </content>
