  St. Lawrence is a well organised     
little school with a high-spirited     
group of respectful 4.5-9 year olds.   
There are ten classes  with about 28   
pupils in each making a total of 272   
well-cared for, good average pupils.   
There is an old building, a new        
building built in 1972 and an annex.   
  The 12 teachers  cover 11 subjects   
as well as extra curricular activities 
including dancing, football, athletics,
gymnastics, chess and birdwatching.    
The polite children respond well in the
happy, working atmosphere. The walls   
are brightly decorated with a high     
standard of pupils' artistic and       
written work.                          
  Pupils in Class 8 (aged 9) took part 
in the Domesday Survey.
