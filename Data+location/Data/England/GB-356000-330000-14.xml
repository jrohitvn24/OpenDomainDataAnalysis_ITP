		<title>14SILVER CLUB LOWER HEATH</title>
		<content> A meeting of the parishioners of{Fauls
 was held on 10.10.77 because of the   
 expressed hope of many who took part  
 in the{Queen's Silver Jubillee        
{Celebrations,}that "Something be done 
 to perpetuate the spirit of fellowship
 and co-operation".{Fauls Silver club  
 was formed.It has a unique age range  
 of members from 9 weeks to 90 years.  
 It has mixed religions; political     
 views; walks of life:it is a complete 
 cross-section of the community.Its    
 members enjoy a wide range of social  
 and educational activities-{dances,   
{quizzes,treasure hunts,lectures.}They 
 raise Â£1000's for{charity}and for the 
{parish.}They have found hidden talent 
 which shows up most in the all-member 
 production of the annual{pantomime -  
 full houses for three nights.Since its
 formation 8 years ago the Club has    
 become the nucleus of the parish.     </content>
