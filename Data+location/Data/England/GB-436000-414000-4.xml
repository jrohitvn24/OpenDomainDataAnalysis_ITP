		<title>04BARNSLEY CANAL,NEAR RYHILL</title>
		<content> The Barnsley Canal from the river     
 Calder east of Wakefield to Barnby    
 Basin near Barnsley was completed in  
 1802 and carried mainly coal and corn 
 until closure in 1953.It runs through 
 much attractive countryside and 10 of 
 the original 16 miles are still in    
 water or unobstructed.Two short       
 stretches run through the block;they  
 provide opportunities for fishing,and 
 woodland and towpath walks in Haw     
 Park.                                 
 The Barnsley Canal Group was formed in
 1984 to press for restoration of the  
 canal as far as Barugh.Some work      
 within Barnsley has been done by      
 Barnsley Trades Council Community     
 Programme.Local authorities are       
 sympathetic but a 'Four Council(WYCC, 
 SYCC,WMDC,BMDC)Officer Group formed to
 consider the proposals is not yet able
 to offer financial help.              </content>
