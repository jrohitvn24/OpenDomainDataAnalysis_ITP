		<title>02CHILDRENS HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> My home is very big because I live in 
 a court. My bedroom is full of toys. I
 have got a beanbag and a great big    
 teddy. I help my Mum to do the cooking
 and I make my own bed. We went        
 strawberry picking yesterday and had  
 strawberries and cream last night.    
 ______________________________________
 I live in a flat. I am 7. My Mum is 30
 years old. My brother is 10. We have a
 rabbit, its name is Chalky. Every     
 evening I play school with my dolls.  
 My favourite tea is baked beans and   
 potatoes.        (age 7)

 My Mummy is always in bed, now she is 
 in hospital. I have to help my Dad so 
 he won't lose his job. I make the     
 beds and help to cook the dinner. When
 my Daddy is at work my Granny comes to
 look after me.   (age 7)
