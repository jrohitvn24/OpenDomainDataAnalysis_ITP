		<title>03Housing in Scunthorpe</title>
		<content>   Our square kilometre (0489 0409) is 
 a largely residential area with very  
 few shops or public buildings. The    
 housing is varied, by far the largest 
 proportion is of the semi detached    
 type.                                 
  At the centre is the village of{Old  
{Brumby}with a cluster of cottages from
 the early 19th Century, mostly        
 converted into modern homes. Further  
 development at the beginning of the   
 century on the Gainsborough road      
 enlarged the village and the next     
 housing phase was in the 1920s and    
 1930s along Ashby and Cemetery roads. 
 At this time the new bypass, the      
{Queensway,}was built crossing land    
 owned by{Brumby Farm.}Since the       
 population explosion after the war the
 rest of the farm was taken over.
