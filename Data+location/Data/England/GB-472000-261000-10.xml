		<title>10THE EDGE OF TOWN</title>
		<content>TO THE NORTH AGAIN, AND ONLY CONNECTED 
BY THE WELFORD ROAD, IS ANOTHER, MORE  
MODERN, HOUSING ESTATE, STARTED IN THE 
1970'S AND JUST BEING COMPLETED. THIS  
IS AN OPEN PLAN ESTATE WITH NO HEDGES  
OR FENCES TO THE FRONT GARDENS AND THIS
TOGETHER WITH WIDE PAVEMENTS AND GRASS 
VERGES EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD, GIVES A
VERY SPACIOUS FEEL TO THE ESTATE.THE   
ROADS ARE ALL CURVED AND THERE IS A    
WIDE VARIETY OF HOUSES HERE. THERE IS A
SMALL ROW OF SHOPS IN THE CENTRE BUT   
VERY LITTLE TRAFFIC AS THERE IS NO     
THROUGH ROAD AND ONLY ONE ENTRANCE AND 
EXIT TO THE ESTATE.THE CATS LIVING HERE
WERE ABLE TO LIE QUITE PEACEFULLY IN   
THE FRONT DRIVEWAYS OF THE HOUSES AND  
THE ONLY SOUND TO DISTURB THE PEACE WAS
THE OCCASIONAL RUMBLE IN THE DISTANCE  
AS A TRAIN PASSED BY ON THE NEARBY     
RAILWAY.                               
                                       </content>
