{The Battle of Roundway Down (1643)    
{                                      
{ }During the English Civil War the    
 town of Devizes was put under siege by
 General Waller and his Roundhead Army.
 They were stationed on top of Roundway
 Hill. This gave them an elevated      
 position from which to bombard the    
 town. Cannonball has been found in the
 roof of St.James church near the      
 Crammer.                              
   The Royalist troops counter attacked
 the Parliamentarian troops, durring   
 the night. The Roundheads were driven 
 down the side of the hill, towards the
 covert and slaughtered in the drainage
 ditches below. The ditch is still     
 known as the "Bloody Ditch" today.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
