		<content>    Our Youth Club provides much       
 pleasure and varies activies and      
 interest for young people. The        
 activities include photography,       
 tennis, badminton and computer games. 
    They also run a Junior Club on a   
 Thursday night which involves much the
 same thing.                           
    The Youth Club today helps         
 unemployed and youngsters in trouble. 
 To help the unemployed our youth club 
 started a Contact Club which involes  
 games of pool, badminton, television  
 or any other sport.                   
    The Youth Club leaders help members
 in different ways. They help with     
 problems and they help the unemployed 
 find jobs. After 3 months, if the     
 members have not got a job, they take 
 them on as volunteer workers. Our     
 Youth Club is run by a neighbourhood  
 worker called Dave Russell.           </content>
