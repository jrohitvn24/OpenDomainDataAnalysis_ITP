		<content> My mum works at Revill's all the year 
 round. She pulls onions and cleans    
 them. There are a hundred bunches in a
 crate. If the onions are small , she  
 puts 25 onions to a bunch, and if     
 they're big , 10 to a bunch. Then she 
 puts a rubber band  around the top and
 bottom. There are English and Japanese
 onions. In the winter, when the onions
 are frozen, a tractor comes with a    
 digger on the back and lifts the      
 onions  up out of the ground. If the  
 onions are frozen solid, the workers  
 pull leeks.{Revill's Packing Station:-
 My mum is a Horticultural worker. She 
 works on a conveyor belt packing      
 spring and summer cabbage. I asked mum
 how it was packed. She said it is cut,
 put into crates and brought into the  
 packing shed, where the cabbages are  
 put in plastic bags and then into     
 boxes. The boxes are taken to market. </content>
