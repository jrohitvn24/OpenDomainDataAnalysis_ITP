 Tenant farms with tied cottages were  
 rented from 4 estates on which the    
 owners lived &amp; employed estate        
 workers. Break up of estates began    
 about 20 yrs ago. Little new building 
 is allowed by planners so value of old
 houses is high &amp; are now modernised by
 retired people &amp; commuters.           
 Occupations include Merchant Banker,  
 Accountant, Solicitor, Barristers,    
 Librarian, Civil Servant, local       
 businessmen, Builder, Journalists,    
 Dental Surgeon. These contrast with   
 long standing residents recently      
 employed on estates. Local work       
 includes farming, forestry. Two inns &amp;
 some farms do bed &amp; breakfast for     
 tourists. There are no shops in the   
 area.
