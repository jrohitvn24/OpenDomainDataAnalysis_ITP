		<title>03SOME INTERESTING HEDGES</title>
		<content>   There is a house in Farnley which is
 very interesting. The hedges have been
 cut into different shapes. There are  
 two trains, a boat and a few little   
 houses. The hedges have been there for
 50 or 60 years. The present owner says
 that they were all there when he moved
 into the house. It was quite a shock  
 when he first saw them. Four people   
 had looked after them before him. He  
 cuts the hedges with electric shears  
 and it takes him three to four hours. 
 He cuts them about every two weeks    
 from May to October but they do not   
 need cutting in winter. Nobody helps  
 him trim the hedges, especially not   
 the children because the shears are   
 dangerous for them. He likes the      
 hedges very much but they are a bit of
 hard work.
