{English}only as{a second language.}We

 out that 21 people speak{Punjabi,}3   
 speak{Urdu,}3 speak{Bengali,}2 speak  
{Pushto,}1 speaks{Yugoslavian}and two  
 speak{English,}making a total of 32.  
       In my house I speak English to  
 my sisters and to my brothers,but to  
 my Mum I speak Punjabi.On my table at 
 school 3 people speak Urdu and 2 speak
 Punjabi.Only one person speaks Pushto.
       My friend Wajeea speaks Urdu.Her
 uncle can read and speak{Arabic.}My   
 teacher is English and so are all the 
 rest of the teachers apart from Mrs.  
 Shah and Mrs. Qureshi who speak       
 Urdu.There is a girl in our class     
 called Suzanna Kolar who speaks       
 Yugoslavian.She is the only one who   
 speaks Yugoslavian in this area.
