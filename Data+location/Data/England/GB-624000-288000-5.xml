 children,90% have children under 13.

{Accents:}a majority of Norfolk dialect
 _many London accents,1 German.        
 Newcomers are welcomed &amp; encouraged to
 join in with village activities,but   
 those who enjoy a quiet life will have
 their privacy respected.              
 The area has been spared modern       
 development but has enough newcomers  
 to keep the village viable.With the   
 "Baby Boom" prospects look good for   
 the future.
