		<title>18 Howfield Manor and Farm</title>
		<content>An important amenity in the            
Howfield Wood area exemplifies the     
growing importance of tourism to       
Canterbury in the seventies and        
eighties.Howfield Manor has become a   
hotel and guest house.Incidentally,the 
oldest part of this dwelling coincides 
almost exactly with the date of the    
first Domesday Survey.It has been a    
hotel since 1974.It has 12 rooms,7 of  
them bedrooms.It costs 35-45 pounds a  
day.People from Tokyo,Argentina and New
Zealand are amongst the most distant   
guests.The hotel possesses a well with 
one and a half feet of water at the    
bottom.The well was built in the 12th  
century.At Howfield Wood Farm a        
thriving riding school has sprung up   
with the bridlepaths that run through  
the deciduous woods.
