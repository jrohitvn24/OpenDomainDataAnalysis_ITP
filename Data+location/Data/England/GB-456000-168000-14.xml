		<content> There is a small executive housing    
 estate where most of the people work  
 from their own homes. Opposite Carbins
 Wood is a small counil estate, mostly 
 bungalows.The rest of the houses are  
 scattered.The Avenue across the common
 woodland is of oak trees.It is said   
 the Avenue is haunted by a coach and  
 horses who trying to by-pass the      
 closed road gate drove into a pond.   
 The Bladebone got its name from a     
 mammoth shoulder bone found when      
 digging the foundations.There is a    
 small general and Post Office and a   
 sheltered housing unit for old people.
 The doctors surgery is part of a      
 practice that caters for 6,000 people.
 There are three doctors, a health     
 visitor and three nurses.
