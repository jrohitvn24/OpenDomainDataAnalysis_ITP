The area around Hartwell and Ashton is 
heavily farmed.Most of the farms are   
arable and grow monocultures of wheat  
or barley with occasional fields of oil
-seed.Only one farm has beef cattle and
there are no dairy herds.The boulder   
clay soil is so heavy that Park farm   
has to deep plough every year with a   
crawler.Recently some farmers have     
begun to grow potatoes but already the 
prices are making this not worthwhile &amp;
there is talk of a return to beef or   
sheep herds,the traditional farming for
this area.In Salcey Forest new planting
must now be oak and conifer mixed since
the forest is now a {Site of Special   
Scientific Interest}.Some coppices have
wood banks still but the timber crop is
taken by clear-felling and this changed
the whole character of the forest.
