		<title>15MUNCHING IN MOUNTSORREL</title>
		<content>     In Mountsorrel there are 8 Public 
 Houses, one cafe, one Chinese         
 take-away.                            
     Most of the Public houses provide 
 food in the form of either a hot lunch
 or a cold meal, or just a cob.        
     Along the A6 there is the         
 transport cafe, where lorry drivers   
 can enjoy an early morning fried      
 breakfast with a pot of tea and chat  
 with their friends. It also provides  
 mid-day meals &amp; teas.                 
     The Chinese takeaway has recently 
 changed the location of its premises  
 from opposite the Buttermarket to a   
 larger building a quarter of a km     
 along the A6 towards Loughborough. It 
 seems to be very popular and          
 convenient way of having a meal. It   
 supplies hot food in silver foil      
 containers which consists of things   
 such as rice and vegetables.          </content>
