		<content>  Our area that we are doing is mainly 
 country side. But some of our area    
 which is called{Askern}is covered in  
 shops and houses. The country side    
 which we are doing is covered in a    
 mixture of crops, grassland of some   
 kind, houses and farms. If you go back
 into{Askern}you can see a big         
 difference. Litter is all over the    
 ground and the fumes and smoke coming 
 from the{pit}makes it worse. Most     
 houses in{Askern}are grey and dull    
 with dirt: this is caused by the{     
{mining}and {coalite}industry. Out in  
 the country side the houses stand on  
 their own or with farm buildings. On a
 normal shopping day the market place  
 in{Askern}is usually busy with rushing
 people trying to get their shopping   
 done. About half of the buildings in  
 the country side are farm buildings.
