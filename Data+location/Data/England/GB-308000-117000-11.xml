 The village fete takes place every    
 year.  It is in the street or in a    
 field.  This year there is a coconut  
 shy and a cake stall, a band and lots 
 of other things.  Sir Edward Du Cann  
 is going to open the fete.            
{The Beating of the Bounds}            
 The beating of the bounds takes place 
 on special occasions.  Lots of people 
 from the parish walk 7\ miles around  
 the parish boundaries.                
{Youth Club}

 It starts at 7 p.m.  For juniors it   
 ends at 8.30 and for seniors it ends  
 at 10.  The Youth Club Leader is Mrs  
 Paterson and she is very nice and lots
 of fun. Since it started in Feb. l984
