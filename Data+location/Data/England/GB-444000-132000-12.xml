 him forty questions about what he     
 does.We found out that only seven     
 people work for him.He lives on the   
 premises and is married with two      
 children who are still at school doing
 the{Domesday Project.}He has sixty to 
 seventy horses from January to June   
 and ten to twenty horses from July to 
 December.They are all thorough breds  
 and there is only one stallion,he is  
 black and has{forty}mares.The stud    
 owns eighty boxes and three paddocks. 
 On the land there is a drovers' drive 
 and an Iron Age fort.The foals are    
 born between January and June ,this is
 so that the foals will be the right   
 age to race with their age group.All
