		<title>10CHEVELEY BUILDINGS &amp; CHURCH</title>
		<content> In Cheveley, there are 55 buildings   
 along the main street from the church 
 towards Saxon Street. We estimated    
 that 37 are old, 9 are new and 9 are  
 in between. The roof materials on the 
 buildings are a mixture of thatch,    
 tiles, pantiles, slates and asbestos. 
 Many of the buildings are listed      
 buildings. Mrs Cazenave, the clerk of 
 Cheveley Parish Council, told us about
 them: they are buildings that can't be
 knocked down without permission. If   
 one of the windows falls out, it has  
 to be relaced with the same materials 
 and design.                           
 We visited St Mary's Church Cheveley. 
 It has stained glass windows and white
 walls. 40 people have signed the      
 visitors' book in 1985: most have come
 from Newmarket(9) and 2 have come from
 abroard. There are 202 graves occupied
 and 12 people have been buried in 1985</content>
