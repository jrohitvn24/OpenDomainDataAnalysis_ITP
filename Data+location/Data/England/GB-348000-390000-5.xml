		<content> money hs helped to pay for further    
 expansion. Three new all-weather      
 tennis courts have been built with    
 flood lighting and it is not unusual  
 to see members playing tennis early in
 the morning and at all times of the   
 year. Further additions are planned   
 with money received from a Sports     
 Council grant. The Club is an         
 important part of the life of the     
 Rainhill area.                        
                                       
 Cost of membership for the tennis     
 section is Â£10 for juniors, Â£16 for   
 'intermediates' and Â£28 for adults.   
                                       
 The bowling section costs Â£2 for all  
 ages.
