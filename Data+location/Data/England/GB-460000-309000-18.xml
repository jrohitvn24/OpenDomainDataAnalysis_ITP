		<title>18Changes in Thurmaston.</title>
		<content>    Thurmaston has grown a lot over the
 last fifty years. Many of the fields  
 and allotments have now become housing
 estates. Sand and gravel for building 
 came from local pits that have now    
 disappeared along with the brickworks.
 New industrial estates have grown up  
 on the edges of Thurmaston.           
                                       
    The people have changed too. Many  
 have left to find work elsewhere.     
 Others have move out from Leicester.  
 In a survey of third and fourth year  
 children at Church Hill Junior School,
 17% had moved there in the last three 
 years; 15% between 3 &amp; 6 years ago and
 another 28% between 6 &amp; 10 years ago. 
 That means over half the children in  
 the school were not born in the       
 village but their families had moved  
 in later.
