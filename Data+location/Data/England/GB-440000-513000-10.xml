		<title>10        FEELINGS</title>
		<content> Feelings are something inside you.    
 They make you weak or strong.         
 And when you disagree,                
 No matter what others might say or do,
 Someone is always wrong.              
 Through black and white,              
 Religion and war,                     
 Friendships sometimes break;          
 People think that only they can be    
                                  right
 And turn to violence and hate.        
 Be careful of what you plan to say    
 And how you behave towards others;    
 Do you really want your friendships to
                          be destroyed,
 Or to hate your sisters and brothers? 
 Stop all this evil fighting and       
                            falling out
 Or it will go on forever.             
 Remember all people have feelings,    
 Say, "Sorry!" and be friends          
                            altogether.</content>
