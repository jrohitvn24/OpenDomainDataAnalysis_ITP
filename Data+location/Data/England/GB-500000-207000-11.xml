		<title>11POTTEN END-THE GREEN I.</title>
		<content> THE CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE GREEN IS    
 WHERE THE VILLAGE HALL IS NORMALLY    
 FOUND. SUCH IS THE CASE IN POTTEN END 
 WHERE THE PRESENT VILLAGE HALL WAS    
 BUILT IN 1927. NEXT TO THE HALL IS THE
 HOLY TRINITY CHURCH WHICH COMBINE     
 THEIR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN THE VILLAGE 
 COMMUNITIES WAY OF LIFE,WHICH BECOMES 
 MORE DIFFICULT AS THE AREA DEVELOPS.  
                                       
 EACH YEAR AT EASTER A TRAVELLING FAIR 
 MEETS TO ENTERTAIN THE COMMUNITY,THIS 
 FAIR HAS GOT ALL THE SAME RIDES AND   
 ATMOSPHERE AS ANY OTHER FAIR,BUT I    
 WOULDN'T THINK THAT IT IS QUITE AS BIG
 AS OTHER FAIRS BECAUSE THERE IS SO    
 LITTLE SPACE FOR THE FAIR TO SET UP   
 IN. THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR AS LONG
 AS ANYBODY IN THE AREA CAN REMEMBER.
