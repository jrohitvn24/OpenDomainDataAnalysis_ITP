		<content> Birkdale station is situated near the 
 edge of the small village.It is easy  
 to get to from most roads in and      
 around Birkdale.It was built in the   
 late eighteen hundreds.               
   When the station was owned by       
 British Rail,the trains ran from the  
 station every half hour in the        
 evening.                              
   Recently,the station has been taken 
 over by Mersey Rail.This means that   
 the trains run more often,every       
 ten minutes.                          
   The trains consist or six           
 carriages,each containing seventy-two 
 seats                                 
   There are 22 stations at which the  
 train has to stop,the last one        
 being,Hunts Cross.It takes fifty-five 
 minutes to get there from Birkdale.   
   The cheapest fare is 5 pence for    
 children and ten pence for adults.    </content>
