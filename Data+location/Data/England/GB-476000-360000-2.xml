		<title>02Farms in Norwell &amp; Cromwell</title>
		<content>   This is mainly a{cereal growing     
 area, oil seed rape being the main    
 crop, followed by wheat and barley.   
 There is a small amount of oats. Other
 crops such as beans and peas and      
 occasionally potatoes and sugar beet  
 tend to be grown in rotation.         
   It is a{mixed farming}area. There   
 are 5 dairy herds of British          
 Friesians, 2 intensive beef units, 1  
 traditional suckler herd, 1           
 traditional beef herd and 3 farmers   
 with flocks of sheep.                 
   Farming in the area is{heavily      
{mechanised}and so the amount of labour
 required has fallen sharply. The      
 farms tend to be family concerns,there
 only being 4 outside employees in the 
 whole area. The size of farms ranges  
 from{55}to{400 acres.}There are still 
 20 acres of glebe land belonging to   
 the church.                           </content>
