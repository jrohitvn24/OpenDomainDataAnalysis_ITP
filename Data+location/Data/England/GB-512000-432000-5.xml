		<content>   The Hull and Hornsea{Railway}was    
 built and opened in 1864 and became   
 the rail link for the North East      
 Railway. It contained 33km of double  
 track which started at Wilmington     
 Junction and finished in Hornsea. Now 
 the old track has been changed into a 
 tarmaced{footpath.}The old bridges    
 have collapsed or been replaced with  
 new concrete ones.                    
   Sutton-on-Hull and Swine stations   
 are of{local historical}interest.     
 Sutton station was demolished to make 
 way for a playground and the B1237{   
{road.}Swine station still stands but  
 has been gutted by fire. It was       
 converted to a Kingston Training      
 Workshop.
