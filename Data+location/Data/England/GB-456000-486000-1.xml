		<content> This area is within the North York    
 Moors National Park.  It comprises    
 mainly conferous forest, owned by the 
 Forestry Commission, mixed woodland   
 and mixed arable land.  There are no  
 villages but many individual          
 farmhouses all still achively farming 
 the land.  There are is very flat, a  
 plateau with several wooded valleys   
 cut into it.  These are only 3 roads  
 crossing the area and many footpaths  
 enabling walkers to reach the more    
 attractive parts.  Farming is         
 intensive here with crops growing both
 in the winter and summer; there are no
 significant physical restrants to     
 farming or communication.  The River  
 Rye runs across the western edge of   
 this area.
