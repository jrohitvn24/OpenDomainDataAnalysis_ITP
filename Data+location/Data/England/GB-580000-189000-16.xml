		<content>{Fairview}has been a park for 60 years.
 It was once Fairview House,garden and 
 orchard.The perimeter is 968m.We saw  
 6 tennis courts,4 tarmac and 2 grass. 
 Cricketers and footballers use the    
 pavilion,and during the week an under 
 5 playgroup use it.There were swings  
 and a giant back-bend climbing frame  
 in the children's playground.         
                                       
{King George's Field}is in the town and
 it has a big children's play area with
 swings,slides,roundabout and tunnels. 
                                       
{Brooklands}is like a large garden and 
 has been a park for about 6 years.We  
 walked 400 paces around the park and  
 115 paces around the pond.We saw 4    
 sticklebacks and 7 water-lilies.      
 The fir tree was the tallest tree.    
 It started to rain and thunder so we  
 hurried back to our school.           </content>
