		<content> Country people often discard their own
 natural amenities and the arrival of  
 piped water made stock feeding easier.
 The pond was no longer needed and so  
 forgotten.In Coronation year a small  
 committee was set up,a fund started,  
 raising Â£150.New trees were planted,  
 daffodils naturalised along the bank, 
 and reeds established.Help came from  
 Girl Guides,the Parish Council and    
 local farmers.The writer and others   
 brought fry to stock the pond with    
 fish and a local farmer provided 5    
 ducks and a mallard drake.What had    
 been an eyesore started to respond,   
 within a year and over the last 20 yrs
 has become a pleasant aspect of the   
 village at any and every season.      
{Footnote:}Recent vandalism has seen   
 losses of many fish and fowl.It is    
 hoped this will cease before legal    
 action is taken by the warden of pond.</content>
