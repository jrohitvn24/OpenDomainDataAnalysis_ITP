		<title>05THE DEVIL'S STONE</title>
		<content> The Devil's stone is a large rock     
 which lies in front of the great oak  
 which stands before the church room in
 Shebbear village.A few years ago      
 scientists extracted a small piece of 
 it and found it was unlike any other  
 rock in our area.Our vicar has a      
 theory that the stone was put there in
 the Anglo Saxon period when people    
 believed in the Pagon Gods and used it
 as a place of worship.Every year the  
 church bellringers with crowbars turn 
 over the stone.The vicar believes that
 this custom started when some people  
 still worshiped the pagan gods but the
 main were Christians.They turned over 
 the stone to show what they thought of
 the pagan gods.It is the oldest living
 custom in Europe.
