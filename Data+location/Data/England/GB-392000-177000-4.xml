		<content> There is one school in Sutton Benger, 
 which serves both that village and    
 Draycot Cerne. It is a Church of      
 England Controlled Primary School,    
 with a role of about 80 pupils aged 5 
 to 11 years. There are three full-time
 teachers, and two part-time teachers. 
 Good parental support provides extra  
 activities, like music, cookery and   
 woodwork.                             
 Older pupils are transported to the   
 large Comprehensive School in         
 Chippenham, where there is also a     
 Technical College.                    
 The parent group, the Friends of      
 Sutton Benger School, hold many fund- 
 raising events to provide "extras" for
 the school. In recent years they have 
 financed the erection of the school   
 hall and lobby area. Their latest     
 purchases include the BBC computer and
 a radio cassette recorder.            </content>
