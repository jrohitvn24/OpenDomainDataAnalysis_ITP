		<title>13KILWORTH'S FLOWER FESTIVAL</title>
		<content>  At intervals of about four years a   
 flower festival is held in st.        
 Andrew's Church,North Kilworth.The    
 most recent of these events took place
 in 1985.They last for three days.     
  The theme for that festival was "The 
 Kingdom".The whole church was         
 decorated with beautiful,intricate and
 cleverly conceived flower arrangements
  .Outside the Church was a flower     
 decorated plough.The porch door was   
 ringed with flowers,whilst inside,    
 on the stone seats, were two "Well    
 Dressing"boards,with texts in flower  
 petals,made by the schoolchildren.    
  Inside the church every window       
 sill,pew end,corner and crevice held  
 its arrangement.Hanging from the light
 fittings were flowers in picture      
 frames.The Chancel was a riot of white
 and gold,with flowers climbing to the 
 top of the East wndow.Â£900 was raised.</content>
