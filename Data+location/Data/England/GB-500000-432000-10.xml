		<title>10High School Buildings.</title>
		<content>  We looked around the main building,  
 the hall, the cloakroom and           
 classrooms. There were four           
 playgrounds, tennis courts, and a     
 swimming pool. The swimming pool was  
 in the open air but it looked very    
 nice. There were two other main       
 blocks, the Art block and the Maths   
 and Science block built in the 1970's.
 There were two dining halls where the 
 pupils serve themselves and can choose
 what they wish to eat. We cannot      
 choose at our school and so I am      
 looking forward to going to Harland   
 Way. The school has a uniform which is
 mainly maroon and grey.
