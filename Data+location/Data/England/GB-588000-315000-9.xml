		<title>09  BIOGRAPHY OF PENSIONER</title>
		<content>  Every Thursday in Litcham there is a 
 Silver Lining club,where nearly all   
the old aged pensioners get together   
and do things like sewing,bingo and    
they also watch the television.        
 When they wake up they usually make   
a cup of tea and listen to the radio.  
Then they will start on the housework  
or tidy up the garden.The housework    
they do is:vacuum cleaning the house   
and the washing.Most old aged people   
are not allowed to do much housework   
as they have some serious illnesses.If 
they do not feel well they can just go 
across the road to the doctors as the  
Health Centre is opposite the old      
aged pensioners home.                  
 Although this lifestyle seems dull    
and boring,most of the old people      
enjoy living in Litcham and the slow   
pace of life suits them.
