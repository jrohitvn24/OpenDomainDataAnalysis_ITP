		<title>16SOUTH MOOR MEMORIAL PARK</title>
		<content> In 1920 South Moor Colliery presented 
 a park to the village to commemorate  
 the miners and other local inhabitants
 who died in the 1914-18 World War.    
 The park today provides tennis courts 
 and bowling greens while the children 
 play on the swings and roundabouts,   
 although the slide has gone.The       
 paddling pool also has proved too     
 expensive to repair and will be made  
 into an extended play area.           
 The whole family can enjoy a walk in  
 extensive natural woodlands through   
 which runs Stanley Burn,crossed in    
 several places by small footbridges.In
 this area many wild flowers are to be 
 found,as well as cultivated ones in   
 the more formal flowerbeds.           
 The park is now cared for by the local
 council who continue to provide an    
 attractive family area.
