		<title>03Farming in Much Marcle</title>
		<content> In Much Marcle there is quite a lot of
 flat land but in places it is quite   
 hilly.Most of the land is very fertile
 and supports crops such as            
 rape,wheat,barley,oats,beans,peas and 
 tayberries. There is good pasture land
 for rearing dairy and beef cattle plus
 sheep. The farmers use a lot of sprays
 to keep the weeds out of the fields,  
 and fertilisers to increase crop      
 yield.Most of the farmers use tractors
 and modern implements and combine     
 harvesters. The farmers are very busy 
 from Spring until Autumn with the     
 different crops ripening at different 
 times.The quiet time of the year is   
 Winter. Farming has changed very much 
 over the years. Nowadays we use       
 tractors instead of horses and we grow
 different varieties of crop. Finally  
 we spray the crops more.
