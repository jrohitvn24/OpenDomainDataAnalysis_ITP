		<title>10MALBOROUGH HOUSING</title>
		<content> There are many{Housing Developments } 
 in our{District.}One of them is in    
{Galmpton}where seven new houses are   
 being built. Each house is made of    
 stone, and they are all modern        
 designs. Another development is       
{Portlemore Close}which has recently   
 been built and  added on to{Jubilee   
{Road,}which is a council estate.There 
 are many other housing developments   
 that have been developed over the     
 years.{Malborough Park}was another    
 building site which was built on for  
 the war for a special purpose. The    
 houses were built for the{R.A.F.      
 serving  in{World War Two.}The prices 
 of the houses in{Galmpton}are higher  
 than anywhere else in the{D-Block     
{because}they have a sea view. They are
 also the only houses that have been   
 developed with a sea view.
