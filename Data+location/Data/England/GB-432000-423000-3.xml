        HIDE AND SEEK                  
 A GAME WE PLAY AT SCHOOL IS 'HIDE AND 
 SEEK'.   THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PLAYING GO
 AND HIDE AND ONE STAYS AT A WALL AND  
 COUNTS UP TO TEN WITH THEIR EYES      
 CLOSED.   AFTER HE OR SHE HAS COUNTED 
 THE PERSON AT THE WALL GOES AND LOOKS 
 FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE TO HIDE  
 AND WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND THEY    
 RACE BACK TO THE WALL TO TRY TO TOUCH 
 IT FIRST.   THE LAST ONE TO TOUCH IS  
 'ON'.   THE RULES ARE THAT THE PERSON 
 COUNTING HAS NOT GOT TO LOOK WHERE THE
 OTHER PEOPLE ARE HIDING WHILST        
 COUNTING OR THEY WILL KNOW WHERE THEY 
 HAVE GONE.
