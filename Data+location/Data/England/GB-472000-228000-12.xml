		<content> Mrs Jenny James runs her practice from
her home at Manor Farm Padbury.She     
visits about 60 farms in the           
area,treating live stock, but does not 
work with horses.                      
Surgery appointments may be booked,    
mon - fri 8.30 - 10.30am &amp; 4.00 - 7.00 
pm.Times may vary, especially at       
lambing time.Mrs Masterton also works  
in the pratice.                        
Cats,dogs and small pets such as       
hamsters, tortoises and guinea pigs    
form the main part of surgery work but 
goats, ferrets, stick insects and      
snakes  are also her patients.         
Work can be physically demanding,      
especilly calving cows.It is difficult 
to fit holidays into the busy schedule.
Luckily there are few night calls.     
Mrs James also runs a cattery at manor 
farm.                                  
                                       </content>
