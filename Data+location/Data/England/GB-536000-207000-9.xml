		<title>09THE CLOCK TOWER</title>
		<content> The Clock Tower is considered to be   
 the centre of the town and helps to   
 give the town its identity. The first 
 clock tower was built of wood and was 
 finished in 1705.                     
  It has been used as a fire           
 station with a horse drawn engine.    
  The old wooded Clock Tower rotted and
 was replaced with a new brick-built   
 one which was completed in 1836. Part 
 of the funds were raised from the sale
 of the old bell. Bricks were donated  
 by local benefactors. The new building
 had beneath it a public bath house.   
 All of the associated buildings have  
 now been demolished, leaving the tower
 surmounted by a weather vane in the   
 shape of a mermaid.
