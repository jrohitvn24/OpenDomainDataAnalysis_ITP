		<title>13LEDCREICH HOTEL BALQUHIDDER</title>
		<content> Ledcreich is situated halfway along   
 the north side of Loch Voil in 20     
 acres of grassland surrounded by oaks,
 birches and some large pines and      
 larches. It is bound on the west by   
 Allt Gleann Cratha, a steep burn with 
 waterfalls, and on the east by an old 
 march wall or "creich".               
 Earliest deeds to hand date from 1731,
 where the owner was Patrick Stewart.  
 In 1756 it was taken over by the      
 McVean family and a century later by  
 the Carnegie family when Ledcreich was
 occupied by various tenants. From 1953
 it was owned as a summer house by Lady
 June Audley, whose permanent          
 housekeeper was district nurse Meg    
 Ferguson. In 1978 the Hilditch family,
 hoteliers from Skye, bought and       
 converted Ledcreich into a luxury     
 hotel and restaurant which receive    
 acclaim from near and far.            </content>
