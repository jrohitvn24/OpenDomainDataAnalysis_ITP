		<title>09Greenhow Hill Farm, Gt.Ayton</title>
		<content> This farm is on the western edge of   
 Gt. Ayton. The buildings are on a very
 low hill a few metres above the stell 
 that drains this area into the River  
 Leven.                                
  Mr.L.Martin owns and farms this land 
 with the help of his wife and two     
 workers. He owns 225 acres and rents a
 further 30. Much of the land is under 
 rotational grass for his dairy herd   
 and some sheep, but he also grows     
 wheat, barley, potatoes, oats,        
 turnips, peas  and 'Tyflon' (an       
 experimental green crop).             
  The farm used to be two seperate     
 units, but now includes Manor Grange's
 fields:this typical of many local     
 farms.
