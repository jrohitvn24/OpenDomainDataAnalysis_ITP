		<title>12CHANGING LIFE IN A VILLAGE</title>
		<content> There has been a settlement at Lutton 
 since Saxon times, when the village   
 was at the very edge of the sea.The   
 present church, built in the          
 thirteenth century, and named after   
 St.Nicholas, is a tenuous link with   
 the villages sea-faring past.The sea  
 is now some two miles distant, and the
 surrounding landscape is not one of   
 marshes, but of rich and fertile      
 agricultural land.Life in the village 
 has changed immensely over the last   
 thirty years, and many inhabitants    
 remember the days of non-mechanised   
 farming.Social life in the village has
 changed little,the village church,pub 
 and school being the centre s of      
 village social functions.The village  
 shop and mobile businesses provide    
 most residents with their needs,but   
 most major shopping expeditions make  
 for King's Lynn,Wisbech or Spalding.  </content>
