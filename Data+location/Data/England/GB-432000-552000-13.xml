		<title>13Hastings Hill and Grindon</title>
		<content>   The Bronze Age burial site of       
 Hastings Hill overlooks the south     
 western edge of Sunderland.It also    
 forms the beginning of a green belt   
 stretching two and a half kilometers  
 towards Penshaw and Shiney Row.       
   From the vantage point of Hastings  
 Hill Bronze Age settlers could have   
 surveyed forests of deciduous trees.  
 Today looking north east and south    
 east from the hill produces a totally 
 different picture. Here lies the post-
 war building development of Sunderland
 a mixture of private and council built
 residential houses. One of the most   
 important roads in the north east,the 
 A19, borders this residential area.   
   Both Grindon in the north and Middle
 Herrington in the south have easy     
 access to the countyside and the town.
 They also have their own small local  
 shopping areas and services.          </content>
