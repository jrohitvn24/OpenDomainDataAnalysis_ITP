   This stone edifice is  dedicated  to
 All Saints.It is a simple stone church
 with  a nave and a chancel.  The Vicar
 is the Rev.Mike Alexander  who is also
 Vicar of Hazelwood.  Services are held
 each Sunday.The Church magazine is the
{Turnditch  and  Windley  News }but  it
 contains  information  about all sorts
 of  other  things   happening  in  the
 parish.The churchwardens this year are
 Mr.F.Yoell and Mr.P.Waldron. There was
 no  burial  ground  until  1846.  More
 ground was consecrated in 1890.Mr. and
 Mrs.V.Vallance  keep  the  church  and
 churchyard tidy.                      
   The ecclesiastical parish covers the
 whole of Turnditch and Windley,  there
 never having been a church at  Windley
 so far as we know.Until 1846, it was a
 daughter  chapel  of  Duffield  Parish
 Church in  the  Hundred  of Appletree.</content>
