		<title>15Shopping Survey</title>
		<content> Sixty four people were interviewed in 
 the village. The majority lived in    
 Balsall Common, but some lived in     
 Kenilworth, Solihull or even Coventry.
 Balsall Common is an average sized    
 shopping area for a small town but    
 tends to be used for small items. The 
 shop which is used the most is the    
 newsagents, closely followed by the   
 greengrocer,the banks,the Co-op and   
 Gold-seal (a food shop).              
 There is a mixed opinion about the    
 parking space in Balsall Common, some 
 think it is satisfactory, but the     
 larger amount of people thought not.  
 Over half of the people interviewed   
 were satisfied with Balsall Common    
 although a chip shop and a shoe shop  
 are largely in demand. Most of the    
 people that we interviewed shopped in 
 Balsall Common once or twice a week.
