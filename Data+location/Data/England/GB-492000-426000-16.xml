		<title>16FIRE SERVICE - BROUGH</title>
		<content> Brough Fire Service is sited at       
 British Aerospace, and recently became
 a Retained Station. It is manned by 14
 factory workers,  each equipped with a
 signal unit operated from a control   
 point to which there is a maximum five
 minute response. The firemen have a   
 two_hour training session weekly,     
 participating in lectures and drills. 
 They are drilled as paid firemen, not 
 just classified as such, and are paid 
 an annual retainer as well as for call
 outs and drills. Uniforms and un_dress
 uniforms are provided free. The       
 station has a water ladder engine,    
 holding 400 galls and 13.5 m. ladder, 
 and a water tender holding 400 galls  
 and a 10.5m. ladder. Each crew        
 comprises 6 men. If a major incident  
 causes the main station in Hull to use
 all their equipment, Brough equipment 
 is sent to West Hull on standby.      </content>
