    Warrington has been an important   
 area concerning transport since Roman 
 times. It was the furthest point west 
 where the River Mersey could be       
 bridged.                              
    The first important road in our    
 region was the Roman road which went  
 through Warrington to Hadrian's Wall. 
 This has always been the major road   
 through the town.                     
    In 1831 a railway line was built   
 joining Warrington with the           
 Liverpool/Manchester railway and by   
 1846 the town was an important station
 on the main north/south line from     
 Carlisle to Birmingham (LNWR).        
    Waterways have been important in   
 the east/west movement of goods,      
 chiefly between Liverpool and         
 Manchester.                           </content>
