		<content> Hartington is a popular tourist area  
 attracting many people because there  
 are so many interesting places to go  
 to and many beautiful walks. Because  
 of this Hartington has plenty of gift 
 shops and guest houses. There are     
 excellent public houses. Many coaches 
 stop here to let the tourist visit the
 gift shops and buy ce creams and      
 refreshments. People we interviewed   
 said that they liked Hartington. It   
 was so pretty. They visited the cheese
 shop to buy Stilton. One of our finest
 old houses, Hartington Hall, is now   
 the youth hostel visited by hundreds  
 of people throughout the year.        
 Although more people visit the village
 in the summer and spring, we still get
 many visitors in autumn and winter.
