		<title>13   A VILLAGE EVENT</title>
		<content> A barbecue was held in the Rectory    
 garden on Friday 13th July at 7.30pm. 
 It was to raise money for repairs to  
 the church roof and some proceeds to  
 charity.  It was a pleasant evening   
 and about 40 people were present.     
 The food consisted of hot dogs and    
 beefburgers cooked by Mrs Hall and Mrs
 Bunn, afterwards there was            
 strawberries and cream.  There was    
 also a stall selling drinks.  There   
 were several games with prizes for the
 winners.  Each entry ticket had a     
 number on it which was drawn for a    
 prize. There was also a raffle.  At   
 10.15pm it began to get dark and the  
 barbecue was brought to a close.
