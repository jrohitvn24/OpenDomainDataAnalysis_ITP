 council houses and a few live in      
 mansions.These houses have many       
 different rooms.One of these rooms is 
 a KITCHEN. A kitchen has a sink with  
 hot and cold running water(a place    
 where dirty crockery and cutlery are  
 washed).A kitchen also has an oven    
 where food can be heated and cooked.  
 A grill would be adjoined to the oven 
 where food can be cooked and grilled  
 at the same time.In a kitchen there   
 are cupboards where crockery is stored
  Another room in the house was a {    
 BEDROOM.In this room people sleep in  
 a bed and have time to themselves.    
 There was bed,a lamp to read by at    
 night and there may also have been a  
 desk. Most houses are quite old       
 although some are fairly new.
