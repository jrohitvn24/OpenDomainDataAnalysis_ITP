		<title>02WISLEY/OCKHAM AIRFIELD</title>
		<content> On the Wisley/Ockham border is the    
 derelict airfield constructed in 1943 
 by Vickers Aviation(on land scheduled 
 to be restored later to agriculture)  
 as an addition to their Weybridge     
 works. Hangars and workshops were     
 removed in 1973, but failure to remove
 the runway and a recent application to
 turn the area into a terminal for     
 light aircraft  caused concern. Public
 opposition and a costly enquiry raised
 issued such as erosion of green belt, 
 damage to natural beauty, pollution   
 affecting  plants at the RHS near-by, 
 noise and traffic increase. As a      
 result barriers now cross the runways 
 and footpaths are restored, but the   
 future of the land, now growing some  
 crops again is still in doubt since,  
 in spite of the M25 road link, it is  
 being claimed for a Heathrow/Gatwick  
 helicopter base.                      </content>
