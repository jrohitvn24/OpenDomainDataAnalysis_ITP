		<content> In Apperley there are five parents who
 work at{Cheltenham}for the {Government
{Communications Headquarters }which    
 has occupied two sites there since    
 1952. It is a highly secret           
 organisation, achieving publicity     
 during 1984 when the{Conservative     
{Government of Mrs. Thatcher           
 arbitrarily banned trade unions on the
 grounds of 'national security'.       
 Workers there are highly educated and 
 comprise many academic disciplines    
 including engineering, mathematics,   
 linguistics electronics and computing.
 Accordingly they seek accommodation in
 attractive housing areas such as      
 Apperley.  Other major employers of   
 professional people within commuting  
 distance of Apperley is the           
{Severn-Trent Water Authority}and      
{Dowty Mining,}making hydraulic pit    
 props in{Tewkesbury.                  </content>
