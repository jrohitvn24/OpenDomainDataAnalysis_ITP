		<content>The present building, dedicated to St. 
Mary and All Saints, dates from the    
early twelfth century, being           
extensively rebuilt in 1844. It was    
once part of the Sutherland family     
estate but now serves a growing parish 
of new homes. A yew tree reputed to be 
1300 years old and the base of a cross 
dedicated to St. Werburgh in 875 A.D.  
may be seen. Some Jacobean silver      
Communion ware is kept in the church   
and Charles I Coat of Arms, with       
Cromwellian bullet holes, hangs over   
the North door. A new vestry was built 
in 1933 and extended in 1967. In 1982  
the Church Centre was built. Since the 
Domesday book there have been 42       
priests and priors, but at the moment  
the parish is awaiting the appointment 
of a new vicar.
