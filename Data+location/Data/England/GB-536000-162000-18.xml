		<content> MEN GO TO WORK.MOST PEOPLE DO THERE   
 FOOD SHOPPING AT SAINBURYS IN WEST    
 WICKHAM.I DONT THINK THEY HAVE HAD AND
 BURGALARIES BECAUSE IF THEY HAD THEY  
 WOULD HAVE HAD MORE BURGLAR ALARMS.IT 
 SEEMS A VERY MIDDLE CLASS AREA,THE    
 HOUSES ARE QUITE LARGE BUT THE MOST   
 ROOMS A HOUSE HAS GOT ARE ONLY        
 ELEVEN.THE FAMILIES IN THE AREA ARE   
 ONLY SMALL ONES WITH THE MOST BEING A 
 FIVE PERSON FAMILY.OVER HALF HAVE     
 DOUBLE GLAZING BUT THIRTY FIVE HAVE   
 CENTRAL HEATING AND THIRTY FOUR OF    
 THOSE ALL HAVE GAS.THE FAVOURITE DAILY
 AND SUNDAY PAPERS WERE THE EXPRESS AND
 MAIL.THE PEOPLE DONT SEEM TO HAVE MANY
 LUXURIOUS THINGS LIKE A VIDEO AND     
 COMPUTER AND THEY DONT SEEM TO BE VERY
 RELIGOUS WITH ONLY TWELVE OUT OF FIFTY
 PEOPLE GOING TO CHURCH REGULARY.WHEN  
 PEOPLE GO OUT THEY SEEM TO PREFER     
 ENGLISH RESTAURANTS TO FOREIGN ONES.  </content>
