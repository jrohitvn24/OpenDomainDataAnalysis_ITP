		<content> Parents fight for school choice.      
 Parents have been complaining that    
 their children have got a different   
 school completely to the one that they
 wanted.  One parent has written to    
 Mr.Crawford at the Education          
 Department to show her disgust and    
 anger.  Children who have been forced 
 to go to schools not on their choice  
 forms may show little interest in the 
 subjects at that school.  A compaign  
 is being mounted by the families whose
 children have been given a different  
 school.  Part of this problem is that 
 Fairfax School has only taken 150     
 pupils compared to last year's 210.   
 Because of this the Education         
 Department are trying to cover up by  
 merging Fairfax with John Willmott.   
 The parents are getting together to   
 organise a march to try to get the    
 Education Dept. to change it's mind.  </content>
