 Mr.Richard Froud and his two brothers 
farm 1,000 acres on the Downs south of 
Wantage.They employ 5 men.They own 2   
combine harvesters.                    
They grow wheat for bread and biscuits,
and barley for beer and animal feed.   
The crops are sprayed to kill the weeds
which are wild oats,goose grass and    
couch grass.In a barn we were shown all
sorts of pipes and switches and a big  
underground tank where the grain is    
stored.                                
 They also grow hay.It is taken to a   
barn where there is a big fan to dry   
it.This prevents it from overheating in
haystack.                              
 They used to rear beef cattle but this
is not profitable now.
