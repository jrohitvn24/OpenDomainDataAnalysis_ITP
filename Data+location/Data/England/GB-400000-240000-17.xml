 SHOPPING ON THE NEW ESTATE            
                                       
    We used to do all our shopping in  
 the town but Mum always found it      
 difficult to find a parking space for 
 the car. Now we do most of our        
 shopping at the Presto supermarket in 
 the middle of the Four Pools estate   
 where there is a big free car park.   
    Dad uses the new Great Mills Do It 
 Yourself store to buy paint, wood,    
 nails etc. but he is sorry that two of
 the older established hardware shops  
 in the town have just closed down. The
 new places have a good selection of   
 goods but you don't get the personal  
 assistance and advice found in the    
 town shops.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
