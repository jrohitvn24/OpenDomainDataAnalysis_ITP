		<title>12Fun Day in Frogmore.</title>
		<content>{Fun Day }is held every year. It has   
 stalls, races and a rounders' match - 
 Sherford against Frogmore.            
 The races are great fun and nobody    
 minds losing. The obstacle race is the
 most fun. You have to start off       
 together and then you have to climb   
 over a large trailer with bales of    
 straw on, run through a gap in the    
 hedge, run up to the bank and jump the
 stream, then run into the forest along
 the path, up to the plank bridge, walk
 across it, under the bridge that is   
 made of two bales with tarpaulin over 
 the top and then up to the finishing  
 line. There are other races like the  
 wheelbarrow race, sack race, running  
 races and slow and fast bicycle races.
 The winners get a lolly pop or some   
 sweets.
