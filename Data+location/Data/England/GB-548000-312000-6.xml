 Suttons Roses in the village of West  
 Walton is an inportant local industry.
       Mr Sutton grows three main types
 of roses ,Tubercular roses, Bush roses
 and Climbing roses.                   
     The dark soil in this area is very
 good for growing most roses. Although 
 he does use fertiliser to make his    
 plants grow better and produce a      
 better crop. This summer in 1985 he is
 growing over one million roses.He     
 actually owns about thirty three acres
 of land and he rents another three    
 hundred acres.                        
      There are many problems how ever.
 Rose plants suffer from a disease     
 called  mildew. This is when the plant
 is exposed to the damp and fungi grows
 on it. The fungi can also cause a     
 disease called rust which produces    
 spots on the leaves.                  </content>
