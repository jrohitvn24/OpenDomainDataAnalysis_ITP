 problems in Britain today and{Heywood}
 too is affected. A small survey       
 carried out at a centre for unemployed
 showed that the majority had had work 
 if only for a short time, but periods 
 of unemployment ranged from 3 weeks to
 5 years. {The causes }were seen as a  
 lack of available jobs and the failure
 of the Government to act and help. The

 money to spend on recreation and      
 clothes were seen as the main personal
 problems and all saw a connection
