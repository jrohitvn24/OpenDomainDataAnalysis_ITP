		<title>09MY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> I have lived in Little Clacton all my 
 life &amp; I would not like to move to any
 other place. All my friends live here 
 too. There isn't much vandalism &amp; it  
 is quite quiet. Most of the homes are 
 bungalows &amp; it is a place for older &amp; 
 retired people. In the winter they    
 don't like us throwing snowballs, but 
 really its a friendly place to live.  
 There are farms all round the village 
 &amp; it has three caravan sites. Our     
 playing field has a climbing frame but
 the swings &amp; the roundabout have had  
 to be taken down. During the summer   
 time, London Road gets very busy      
 because of all the holiday makers     
 coming through. They are going to the 
 beaches or to one of the caravan      
 parks. It is difficult for us to cross
 the road. But Little Clacton has all  
 the facilities that my family needs &amp; 
 I think its a nice place to live.     </content>
