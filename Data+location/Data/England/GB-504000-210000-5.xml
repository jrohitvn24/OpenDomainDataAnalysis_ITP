		<content> I come to school by car. When I arrive
 I can go in to class. My headmaster   
 teaches us all the time. There are{28 
{children}aged 5 to 11 yrs. in two     
 classes. We have our own cook and     
 everyone stays to dinner. Our parents 
 are painting the office and corridor. 
 The headmaster has ripped the rotten  
 wood from the large cupboard. Our     
 school was opened in 1877. We have the
{Log books.}We all go{swimming}each    
 week. Our parents take us by car to   
 Hemel. We can use the P.E. equipment  
 at playtime. We have two tennis       
 nets. We each have our gardens and    
 there is a pond too. We have{pets}in  
 class: Russian hamsters, gerbils,     
 stick insects and a budgie. Our stock 
 cupboard is full of things from the   
{Childrens' Scrap Project,}London. Our 
 problems this year were frozen pipes, 
 woodworm, dry rot, moles and wasps.   </content>
