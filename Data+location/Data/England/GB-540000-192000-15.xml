		<title>15LOCAL NEWS,BUCKHURST HILL</title>
		<content> Our local newspaper is the West Essex 
 Gazzete.There are 9 different editions
 of it covering 9 different areas.Our  
 edition covers 3 different areas      
 Loughton,Buckhurst Hill and Chigwell. 
 In the local Gazzette office in       
 Loughton there are 3 reporters,       
 receptionist and 2 part time ladies.  
 There are 8 photographers.The part    
 time ladies deal with the             
 advertisements. A whole page          
 advertisement costs Â£1,000.The chief  
 reporter tells people what to do.The  
 reporter we spoke to found the        
 dramatic stories the most interesting 
 and council meetings most boring. The 
 stories for the paper are typed in    
 Loughton then taken to the sub-editors
 who put it on pages.Then they are sent
 to Southend for printing.
