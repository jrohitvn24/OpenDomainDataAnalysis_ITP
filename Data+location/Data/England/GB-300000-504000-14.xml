		<content>  The vast majority of the people of   
working age in the area are employed at
the Sellafield Site. They work either  
in the Calder Hall Neuclear Power      
Station or in the chemical             
reprocessing plant of the Windscale    
Works.                                 
 There are several farms in the area   
providing work and some private        
businesses such as garages and building
fims.                                  
  Most women are housewives. Some have 
their own private business such as the 
hairdresser.                           
  There is very little unemployment in 
the area except for the new school     
leavers for whom jobs are very scarce.
