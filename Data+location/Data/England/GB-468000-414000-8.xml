 no fun going outside on a cold        
 night.In the fifties there were       
 some-times more than ten in a family. 
   The children went to church many    
 times a week,three times on a         
 Sunday,twice during the week and then 
 Sunday school. This was about normal  
 for the children.                     
   Most children liked school and most 
 walked to it each day. Every-one wore 
 school uniform and if they did'nt wear
 it they got the cane. When any child  
 did something wrong they got two to   
 four strokes of the cane. No-one ever 
 told their parents because they then  
 got the slipper for doing something   
 wrong in the first place.             
   After school all the children used  
 to play in the street. They had to    
 make up their own games, for there    
 were no televisions and few radios.   </content>
