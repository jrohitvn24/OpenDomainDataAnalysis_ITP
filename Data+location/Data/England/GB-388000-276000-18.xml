		<title>18Red Hall Farm</title>
		<content> This is a typical farm and has 13     
 fields covering 240 acres. It has been
 owned by the Pheysey family since     
 1912. My uncle Peter (the present     
 owner) is interested in rare breeds of
 cattle and he keeps a mixture of Devon
 Reds, Old Gloucesters and Limousin    
 together with modern Charolais,       
 Herefords and Friesians. The cattle   
 eat grass in the summer and silage    
 in the winter. He also keeps 800 pigs 
 which are reared and sold through a   
 farming syndicate. They eat a mixture 
 of soya bean, fish meal and corn. The 
 crops produced are mainly wheat, grass
 for silage and hay and barley. Good   
 barley is used to produce malt which  
 is used to make beer, the rest is used
 for bread flour and the poorer quality
 for animal feed. My uncle uses a lot  
 of modern machinery, but he shares the
 more expensive items. (Pamela Pheysey)</content>
