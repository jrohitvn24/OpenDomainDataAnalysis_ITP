		<content>    North of this block the{Fosse Way  
 crosses another Roman road,the{Watling
{Street}(A5) at High Cross and carries 
 traffic to the M1 and M6.             
   Before the{Oxford Canal}was         
 straightened there was a village dock 
 yard for boat building and heavy      
 goods.A boat hire business is still   
 at Stretton_under_Fosse.In the past,  
 folk travelled by foot or carriers    
 cart.Now most families run their      
 own car or travel by public transport.
 Coaches can be hired from a local     
 garage.Contract coaches carry local   
 children to Middle and Secondary      
 schools.Brinklow once had its own     
 station for the London to Birmingham  
 railway,but today people must use the 
 stations of Coventry and Rugby.Within 
 easy reach are the airports at        
 Coventry and Birmingham enabling      
 locals to travel to foreign parts.    </content>
