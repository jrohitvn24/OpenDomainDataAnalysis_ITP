		<title>03The Village of Blackwell A</title>
		<content> A small village on the fringe of      
 Derbyshire, Blackwell is a close knit 
 community which owes much of its      
 growth and character to its mining    
 industry - Blackwell pit. The         
 colliery has since closed but the     
 village retains many of the features  
 of a pit village. The original pit    
 houses lie in the bottom of the       
 village whilst looking down from{The  
{ Mount}were built the pit managers    
 houses. Despite the closure of the pit
 many of the older families still live 
 here but on the modern council estate,
 whilst newcomers occupy the private   
 properties on{The Mount.}
