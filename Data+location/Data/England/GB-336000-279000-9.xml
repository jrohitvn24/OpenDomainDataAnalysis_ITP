		<title>09MY LIFE IN CLUNBURY</title>
		<content> My name is{Jacqueline}and I am 11     
 years old. For breakfast I usually    
 have toast and tea. I check my two    
 horses, clean my teeth, wash, brush   
 my hair and make my packed lunch. At  
 8:40 I go down the drive to wait for  
 the daily bus. There are 10 children  
 on my bus. I go into school and       
 practice the hymns for assembly. At   
 9:00{Mrs Hibbs}comes out and calls    
 everyone in. 7 of us play recorders in
 assembly, we have 35 children in the  
 school. we do maths and English in the
 mornings. At lunch break we take turns
 on the{B.B.C computer.}About half the 
 school have packed lunches; the others
 have a cooked meal brought in a van.  
 After lunch we have a story, then     
 games, art, swimming (we go in a bus  
 every week) or topic work. After      
 school I ride{Sunney}and{Miggy}then I 
 have tea, then I go to at bed at 9:30.</content>
