		<title>16ROCK CHAPEL/ST.MARY'S(CofE)</title>
		<content> During the 19th century Methodism     
 was important to the people. A        
 Chapel was built at the Rock. The     
 first part of it was built in 1861.   
 The stone came from a nearby quarry.  
 The second part was built in 1877.    
 Before they had the Chapel people met 
 in a cottage. In 1851 there were 48   
 people meeting there. In 1976 there   
 were 12 members at the Rock Chapel.   
                                       
                                       
 The local church is St. Mary the      
 Virgin (C. of E.) at Red Lake. It was 
 built in 1799 from grey stone. It has 
 large stained glass windows. It has a 
 graveyard round it. One of the graves 
 said that a man was 100 years old when
 he died. Outside the gate is an old   
 pump which gave water to the village.
