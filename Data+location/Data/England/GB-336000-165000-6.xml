		<title>06FARMING IN WOODSPRING</title>
		<content>  Although fewer people are employed on
 farms now than formerly, farming is   
 the only source of employment in King-
 ston Seymour and Wick St. Lawrence.   
 The average size of a farm holding is 
 100 acres and most farms are owner    
 occupied. Cattle are raised for milk  
 or beef. It requires about half an    
 acre of land to support one cow.      
 Sheep are reared on some farms.       
 Farmers produce hay in the early      
 summer if there is enough sun to dry  
 the grass. Silage is made for winter  
 feed. The grass can be cut twice a    
 year if it grows well. No other fodder
 crops are grown. Some farms have apple
 orchards.  The apples are used for    
 cider making. Nowadays the apples are 
 taken to a factory outside the        
 villages, and cider is not made on the
 premises as it was when cider was the 
 staple drink.                         </content>
