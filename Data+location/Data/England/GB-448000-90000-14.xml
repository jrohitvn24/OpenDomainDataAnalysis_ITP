		<title>14Mystery Animal.</title>
		<content> For two years there has been reports  
 in the area of a mysterious animal    
 with more than a hundred alleged      
 sightings.It is generally described   
 as panther-like and bigger than an    
 alsation dog. A number of sheep have  
 been killed or gone missing around the
 area of Parkhurst Forest.Some have    
 been found with savage wounds with a  
 side torn open and eaten away.The     
 wounds are not such as would be       
 expected from a dog or a fox.Many     
 local people are sceptical about the  
 existence of any unusual animal in the
 area but others believe a large member
 of the cat family is at large and some
 are reluctant to venture out in the   
 countryside alone at night.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
