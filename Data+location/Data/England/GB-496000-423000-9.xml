		<title>09ATTITUDES IN N.FERRIBY.</title>
		<content>    North Ferriby faces the following  
 general problems.There are too many   
 cars going too fast around the        
 village,people do not like it.When    
 children come home they buy sweets and
 drop their paper in the village making
 it untidy.On Monday and Thursday night
 the fish and chip shop is open and    
 this results in a lot of extra litter.
   Some people feel that the bus       
 service is inadequate especially for  
 the retired people without a car.Also 
 some residents complain that their    
 roads are in need of repair and are   
 inadequately lit.                     
   North Ferriby should be a quiet     
 village but because of motor cycles   
 the village can be quite noisy.       
  The village has lots of dogs and     
 horses so some roads and paths can be 
 badly fouled.                         
                                       </content>
