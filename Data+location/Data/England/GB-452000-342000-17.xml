		<content> In the area we found the{Clubs}to be  
 mostly{Youth Clubs, Playgroups}and    
{Cubs, Scouts}and{Boys Brigade.}       
 The{Youth Clubs}totalled 6 and were   
 found in a range of places. They take 
 place in Church Halls, Junior Schools 
 and Community Centres. Only in two    
 cases were the{Clubs}in places        
 designated specially for their use.   
 The{Cubs and Scouts}are based in a    
 Church Hall. The{Boys Brigade}is      
 organised in a different Church Hall. 
 They generally meet at least once a   
 week and are involved in numerous,    
 wide ranging activities.              
 The{Playgroups}involved mothers and   
 toddlers. The bases for these groups  
 to take place were again Community    
 Centres, Infant Schools and Church    
 Halls.                                
 There are also 6 groups for those over
 sixty years.                          </content>
