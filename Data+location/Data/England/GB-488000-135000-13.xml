		<content>  WE FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE    
 POPULATION IN OUR AREA WERE AGED 5O OR
 OVER, WITH FEW PEOPLE BETWEEN 2O AND  
 3O YEARS. THERE ARE FEW VERY YOUNG    
 CHILDREN, MOST BEING AGED 5 UPWARDS.  
 THE CHILDREN OF SCHOOL AGE TRAVELLED  
 AT LEAST ONE MILE TO SCHOOL, USUALLY  
 BY CAR, SOME TRAVELLING AS FAR AS     
 GUILDFORD AND FARNHAM USING PUBLIC    
 TRANSPORT.                            
  ABOUT 53% OF THE WORKING POPULATION  
 OF OUR AREA WERE IN EMPLOYMENT IN     
 LONDON AND ABOUT 2O% IN GUILDFORD.    
 MANY OF THEM MADE REGULAR USE OF THE  
 FAST A3 - M25 LINK TO HEATHROW        
 AIRPORT.FEW PEOPLE USED GATWICK       
 BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULT CROSS COUNTRY
 JOURNEY INVOLVED.                     
  WE WERE INTERESTED TO FIND THAT QUITE
 A LOT OF WOMEN WORKED AT FULL-TIME    
 JOBS IN OUR AREA TOO, USUALLY FROM    
 CHOICE RATHER THAN NECESSITY.         </content>
