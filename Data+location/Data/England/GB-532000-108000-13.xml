		<title>13FARMING</title>
		<content> In Coldean there is alot of forestry  
 land,and ost of it belongs to parks,  
 i.e:Wild Park and Stanmer Park.There  
 are five farms in the area:Court Farm,
 Housedean Farm,Balmer Farm,St Mary's  
 Farm and Stanmer Farm,just off of the 
 A27 and owned by the council.The area 
 is quite hilly,so the five farms raise
 livestock as well as groing crops.The 
 main crop which is grown is barley,   
 both winter barley and summer barley. 
 It is used as animal food.The only    
 cattle and sheep farm is Stanmer.     
    Crops are grown more because of the
 good climate in the South of England. 
 Some other crops are wheat and silage.
 The farmland in Stanmer park is under 
 the eye of the county council to place
 part of the proposed Brighton By-pass 
 in the park,and it could destroy a    
 park which has good farming prospects.
