		<title>10MY HOUSE AND FAMILY IN HOOK</title>
		<content> My house is 21 years old and sited    
 on a corner in Bell Meadow Road-we    
 moved in 4 years ago.The property is  
 semi-detached,has 2 big bedrooms and a
 tiny box room which is now my sisters.
 My bedroom faces the back garden,is   
 nice and light and painted yellow     
 and white.The house was in a terribly 
 neglected state and the garden was    
 overgrown with knee high grass.We have
 rebuilt the kitchen and the garden is 
 lovely now.                           
 My Mum works part time at Jill Homer's
 day nursery at the Old Schoool.My Dad 
 works in Andover and is the accounts  
 manager for a firm of school suppliers
 -he travels there daily by car.We have
 a dog and we walk him in a field near 
 Hook School but not for much longer as
 I expect it will be built on just like
 the rest of Hook.    Soon there will  
 be no places left to play on near us. </content>
