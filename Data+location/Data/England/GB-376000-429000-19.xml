		<title>19HOBBIES AND PETS</title>
		<content> My favourite hobby is Fantasy.Fantasy 
 is a mixture of space and Middle      
 Earth.Middle Earth is about swords    
 goblins and heroes.I like {reading}and
{drawing} as well.                     
  I live in Accrington and go to {Peel 
{Park School.}I travel to school by bus
 but I walk home.                      
 I have got a   pet cat called Bouncer 
 who is always eating,sleeping and     
 biting.He is fat,fluffy and makes the 
 ground shake when he walks or should  
 I say plods along.My grandma has a cat
 as well but it is completely different
 from my cat. It is called Timmy.      
   The sports I like are football and  
 cricket.                              
                Edward Foster.
