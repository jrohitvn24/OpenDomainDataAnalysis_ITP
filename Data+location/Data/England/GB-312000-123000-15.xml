		<title>15POPULAR GAMES AT OAKE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>     THERE ARE THIRTY-SIX CHILDREN AT  
 OAKE. THEY GO TO PLAY IN THE FARMER'S 
 FIELD OVER THE ROAD. THE MOST POPULAR 
 GAME IS FOOTBALL. IT IS MOSTLY BOYS   
 WHO LIKE FOOTBALL. THE RULES ARE:-    
 YOU HAVE ONE GOAL AT EACH END OF THE  
 PITCH, AND ELEVEN PEOPLE IN EACH      
 TEAM, SIX CENTRES, TWO ATTACKERS, TWO 
 DEFENDERS AND ONE GOAL KEEPER. THE    
 IDEA IS:- THE TOP END HAS TO TAKE THE 
 BALL DOWN TO THE BOTTOM END AND GET   
 PAST THE GOALKEEPER TO SCORE A GOAL.  
 THE TEAM WITH THE MOST GOALS WINS.    
 ANOTHER GAME THEY LIKE TO PLAY IS     
 BRITISH BULLDOG. ONE PERSON IS "ON    
 IT". IF THAT PERSON SAYS "FREE        
 PASSAGE" YOU MAY GO PAST WITHOUT BEING
 CAUGHT. IF THE PERSON SAYS "BRITISH   
 BULLDOG" YOU HAVE GOT TO RUN IN FRONT 
 OF HIM OR HER WITHOUT BEING CAUGHT.   
 THE LAST PERSON TO BE CAUGHT IS "ON   
 IT".                                  </content>
