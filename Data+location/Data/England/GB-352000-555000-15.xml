		<title>15PUBS IN CASTLE CARROCK</title>
		<content> There are two public houses in Castle 
 Carrock.   The "Weary Sportsman" has  
 been an inn for over 200 years and was
 originally a coaching inn, as shown by
 the old stables and outhouses at the  
 rear.   The interior boasts oak beams 
 and much brassware.                   
                                       
 The "Duke of Cumberland" has also been
 a public house for many years,        
 although it was converted from a      
 house, and is decorated in an         
 old-style manner.                     
                                       
 Darts and dominoes are major          
 attractions at the "Weary", whereas   
 the "Duke" concentrates more on       
 providing special evenings with food, 
 music, and decoration all related,    
 i.e. Italian Evening.   Both pubs are 
 patronised by people from many miles  
 around.                               </content>
