		<title>09LOCAL NEWS (2)</title>
		<content> The news this week has been dominated 
 by the invasion of tinkers and their  
 families.They arrived in large numbers
 in Carlisle and set up camp on a      
 public car park next to carlisle      
 castle.They had all come for a        
 tinker's wedding.                     
   But everyone in and around Carlisle 
 is talking about them because of the  
 mess they made and the huge task of   
 clearing up after them.The tinkers say
 they have nowhere to go and so must   
 use places like the car park.         
  There have been plans for many years 
 to provide permanent gypsy sites      
 either in the old army camp at        
 Houghton or at Kingstown.The site at  
 Hadrian's Camp is in the middle of    
 our Domesday area and naturally       
 everyone is most concerned.It seems   
 no-one wants the travellers near them.
