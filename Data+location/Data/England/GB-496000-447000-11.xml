		<title>11Farms and farming.</title>
		<content> There are a lot of farms in our       
 Domesday block .They are mostly of    
 about 200  acres. Some of the farms   
 have sheep and cattle but mostly they 
 are arable farms.The crops which are  
 grown are wheat, barley, oilseed rape 
 and peas.The peas are grown for Birds 
 Eye to be frozen.Most of the oilseed  
 rape goes to Cranswick Mill for       
 processing, about four miles east of  
 the block.The barley is used mainly   
 for cattle feed and wheat is sent     
 away to be stored.Some farmers gave a 
 tonne of wheat for Ethiopia.When the  
 sheep are sheared the wool is set to  
 the woollen mills.ome farmers grow    
 kale,swedes and sugar beet.There is a 
 huge sugar mill in York where the beet
 is taken.
