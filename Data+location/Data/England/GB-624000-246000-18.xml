		<title>18 WOODLAND NEAR WOODBRIDGE.</title>
		<content>                                       
There are only small areas of Woodland 
in this part of Suffolk. The Woods we  
walked through were desciduous trees,  
mostly oak and sycamore.               
 The Sycamore trees are often cut so   
they don't grow very tall. The saplings
are used to make hurdles for the sheep 
farm. The farmer makes them into pens  
to collect his sheep together.         
 In the middle of the woods is a small 
cottage where an old lady lives alone. 
She used to draw her water from a well 
by her front door. We saw her pump     
which still works. Now she has a tap in
her kitchen.She has to walk 500 metres 
each day - to fetch her milk from the  
gate at the edge of the woods.She told 
us she likes living in the woods and   
watching the squirrels scampering up   
the trees surrounding her house.
