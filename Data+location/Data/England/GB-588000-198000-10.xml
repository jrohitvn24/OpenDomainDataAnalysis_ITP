		<title>10MY DAY   PART 1</title>
		<content>  My Name is Grace Bentley and I live  
 in                                    
 Ramsey Chase which is in Latchingdon. 
 I get up between 7.00 and 7.30 a.m.   
 get dressed and go down stairs to have
 breakfast, which is usually toast and 
 jam, between 7.40 and 7.50. Then I    
 have my hair brushed and clean my     
 teeth. At about 8.20 a.m. I usually   
 sit down and read a book or something 
 until it is time for school. At 8.40 I
 leave for school and arrive at school 
 and I am in the cloakroom at 8.45 then
 me and all the other children are in  
 the classroom by about 9.50. First I  
 go down to assembly with my class and 
 then I go back to the classroom about 
 9.30 I do some work until 10.30 which 
 is playtime then I go and do the menu 
 with my friend and we put up all of   
 the labels for the food we are having 
 for dinner then I go out to play.     </content>
