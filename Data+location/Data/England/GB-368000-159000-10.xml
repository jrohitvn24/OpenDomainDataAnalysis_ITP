		<title>10FARMING IN THE PRISTON AREA</title>
		<content> Farming in the Priston area is mainly 
 dairy and arable. The majority of     
 fields are sown grassland for the     
 Friesian cows. Crops grown include    
 corn, wheat and barley. There is one  
 beef herd, a few sheep and a small pig
 unit in the area. The farms average   
 300 acres and are generally worked by 
 a family, with a few full-time workers
 living in tied cottages and extra help
 from casuals or contractors. Due to   
 increased wage demands from farm      
 workers, less permanent men are       
 employed these days, as the farmers   
 cannot afford the wages. Mechanisation
 allows the farmer to cover the        
 workload himself. For some farmers the
 EEC quotas make it difficult for them 
 to expand so they look for other areas
 for increased buisness. e.g. Priston  
 Mill farm has instituted 'farm tours' 
 for visitors, mainly school parties.  </content>
