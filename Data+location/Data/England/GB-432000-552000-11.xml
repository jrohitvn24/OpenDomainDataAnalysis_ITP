		<content>   The village of Penshaw is the oldest
 village in this area and its rural    
 origins can be found at{Old Penshaw.  
   Here we can see the Church which    
 dates back to 1746. Around the church 
 are some of the oldest buildings      
 including "Hill Farm House" and the   
 large majestic stone built "Village   
 Farm" house which now forms part of   
 Penshaw Hill Riding School and        
 Equestrian Centre. Along side these   
 buildings we can also find two old    
 village pubs and the remains of the   
{village green}as well as many modern  
 detached bungalows and houses.        
   Behind the church is a small terrace
 of stone built cottages, Lambton Place
 dated 1821. Around the corner can be  
 seen{terraced housing}dated 1881 along
 side{post war development.}The most   
 recent growth is in council &amp; private 
 housing built in the{60's and 70's.   </content>
