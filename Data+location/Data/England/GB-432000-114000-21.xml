<content>

Calmore Community Centre has two large halls and a smaller hall for hire, alongside a bar and changing rooms to accompany the Multi-Sport area outside. A recent addition is the Patch Childrens Centre, which was built out into the car park, and provides support for parents and a basic childrens service. It is joined by the playgroup Bumble Bees playgroup and the many other groups who use the halls, including Brownies, St. John Ambulance Badgers group, Judo and Weight Watchers to name a few. The hall also hosts the annual St. Annes church fete, as well as a christmas party for local children.   &lt;br />
