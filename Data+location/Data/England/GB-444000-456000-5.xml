		<content> The Green, the  oldest housing in the 
 village is round the green.Many houses
 are Georgian or even earlier and they 
 are built of hand made bricks.We could
 see from some of the ends of the      
 houses that they had been altered and 
 made higher and stone material had the
 earliest parts.Many roofs were old    
 tiles with stone coping slabs,a few   
 had slates.These houses were farm     
 houses or cottages.Not many houses    
 were built in the Victorian age,though
 some earlier ones were probably       
 altered.The pub is 18th century.More  
 than half of the village has been     
 built since 1930.Many houses have been
 built in the post_war period          
 1945_1985.These are modern brick with 
 red tile roofs.They are built along   
 the roads and lanes.The church and one
 house are made of stone.
