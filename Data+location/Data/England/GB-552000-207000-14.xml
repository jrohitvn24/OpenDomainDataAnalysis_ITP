		<title>14COLLINS  FARM HIGH LAVER</title>
		<content> Collins Farm is a 400 acre farm in    
 High Laver,near Moreton. Mr.Collins   
 showed us round his farm.The average  
 size of field is 40 acres.He grows    
 wheat, barley, potatoes and grass. The
 potato crop covers 76 acres,barley 120
 acres and wheat 176 acres.These are   
 rotated every 5 years. The balance is 
 made up of grass,farm buildings and   
 yards. Potatoes are his most          
 profitable crop but they are also the 
 most risky because the heavy Essex    
 soils do not guarantee consistent     
 yields. The average annual yield is 20
 tonnes per acre. We saw where , and   
 how the potatoes are cleaned, sorted, 
 graded and bagged,all by one machine. 
 The bagged potatoes are sold to the   
 London market.
