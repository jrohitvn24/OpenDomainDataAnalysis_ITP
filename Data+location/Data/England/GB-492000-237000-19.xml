		<title>19RELIGION A WAY OF LIFE</title>
		<content> Religion is mostly traditional. There 
 is a Protestant church in each village
 St. Nicholas', a Tudor church in      
 Hulcote and the l3th century St.Mary  
 the Virgin in Salford. The minister   
 lives in Cranfield. During each month 
 there are three services held at      
 Salford one of which is a Family      
 Service specifically for younger      
 members of the congregation who attend
 with their parents. Hulcote holds a   
 Communion Service once a month.       
 Services for Harvest Festival and     
 Christmas Nativity are held in the    
 evenings and are well attended. At    
 other times of the year a dedicated   
 core of worshippers attend regularly. 
 Roman Catholic worshippers attend the 
 church at Woburn Sands three miles    
 away.
