		<title>12The Redditch Advertiser.</title>
		<content> Each week{every household}in the area 
 has the Redditch Advertiser delivered 
 free. It was started 10 years ago in  
 1975 by Chris Bullivant who believed  
 that{free newspapers}made sense; the  
{advertising}paid for the paper and was
 sure of being seen by many people. The
 paper was initially 16 pages and      
 compiled as a{cottage industry}in an  
 amateurish manner on the living room  
 floor of Chris's house. By 1978 the   
 Advertiser was a success and expansion
 from Redditch began. Today the paper  
 has incorporated the old traditional  
{Redditch Indicator.}It averages 96    
 pages and 34 000 copies are delivered 
 weekly. It carries local advertising  
 and an extensive{Property Guide}      
 besides photographs of{local events}  
 and reports of interest to the        
 locality. Schoolchildren deliver the  
 Advertiser each Thursday.             </content>
