		<content>{PROBLEM IN SOCIETY.                   
  The main problem today in our Society
 is{unemployment}in both young and old 
 alike.The older people who have been  
 employed and were made redundant or   
 have left their jobs and now cannot   
 get one,are those mostly,that are     
 married with two or three children to 
 support,and this causes alot of       
 problems in families.The younger      
 people who leave school and have no   
 job to go to hang around in gangs or {
{Vandalise}places because they have    
 nothing better to do and often end up 
 in prison.Another major problem of    
 today is drugs,were apart from        
 damaging their health and killing     
 themselves most of them turn to       
 stealing and mugging to get the money 
 for drugs.....
