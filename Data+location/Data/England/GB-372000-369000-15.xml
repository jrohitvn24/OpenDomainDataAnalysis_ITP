		<content> Allostock Rose Fete.                  
 June 15th was the day of Allostock    
 Rose Fete.  The procession gathered in
 Wash Lane at 1.00 PM.  The procession 
 started at 1.30 PM.  We arrived at the
 field at 2.00 PM and proceeded up the 
 centre of the field.  The Queen was   
 crowned and then we watched Morris    
 Dancers and powerlifting.  There were 
 Pony rides and other games and        
 sideshows and many stalls.  There was 
 also a beer tent.  At 8.00 PM there   
 was a disco.
