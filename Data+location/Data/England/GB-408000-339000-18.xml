		<title>18A boy from Denstone.</title>
		<content>   I am Andrew.I live in a new semi-   
detached house in St.Chad's Close      
Denstone with my mum,dad,brother who is
19,and sister who is 16.My dad is a    
butcher in Uttoxeter and my brother is 
a mechanic at the bus station.My mum   
visits people's houses and sells       
household goods at parties.            
   In the holidays I go to the playing 
fields with my friends to play cricket 
or football.If it is raining I play    
with my computer in my bedroom.I like  
to ride my bicycle and often go to the 
village of Alton and especially like   
going to Alton Towers.                 
   There is a youth club on Thursday   
but otherwise there is not much to do  
in Denstone and very few buses to      
Uttoxeter.If we wish to go to the      
cinema, library,or swimming,my mum has 
to take us by car to Uttoxeter.
