		<title>08No.1 SOMERSETS COTTAGES.</title>
		<content> Sited on what was once common land, by
 the crossroads in the centre of the   
 village, the present cottage retains  
 its{two bay open hall}and three       
 remaining{cruck trusses.}Although     
 added to at numerous times, the house 
 retains its steep pitched roof sloping
 to first floor level, and it is now   
 tiled rather than thatched. The timber
 framed walls have been replaced and   
 bricked over. Inside the central      
 hearth remains together with the      
 original soot blackened rafters, now  
 built as an inglenook. Some of the    
 wattle and daub in the closed truss at
 either end of the hall is also sooty. 
                                       
{This is one of the few cruck cottages 
{in this area and dates probably from  
{the early fifteenth century.          
                                       
                                       </content>
