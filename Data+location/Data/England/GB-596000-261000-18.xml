 It is a legend in Woolpit that in the 
 reign of King Stephen a very strange  
 thing happened.In those days our      
 village was called Wulfpit.           
 Some men were in the fields one day   
 when one of them looked down into the 
 holes which were called wolf pits and 
 there he saw 2 green children.Everyone
 crowded round.The men were frightened 
 of the children and the children were 
 frightened of the men.The green       
 children were hungry but they would   
 not eat anything the villagers could  
 offer them.Every lovely food was tried
 until someone thought of green food   
 for green children.This of course was 
 the right thing to do.The children    
 were taught english and treated well  
 but they were not happy and soon the  
 boy died.Eventually the girl knew     
 enough to tell her story.             </content>
