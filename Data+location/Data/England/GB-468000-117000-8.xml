		<content> Because of the high cost of labour,   
 many people who have a large area of  
 land around their houses, run a few   
 sheep to keep the grass under control.
 Each winter the Country Park Centre,  
 in conjunction with Hampshire College 
 of Agriculture,organises a three day  
 sheep management course to help these 
 people.Facilities are also made       
 available for the compulsory dipping  
 of sheep against fly and scab.A sheep 
 shearing service is also available    
 which provides an interesting and     
 educational experience for visitors to
 the Country Park.Television has made  
 sheep dog trials very popular as a    
 spectator sport.Competitions are held 
 each year for local farmers and       
 shepherds.The trials are organised by 
 the Butser Shepherds Society which    
 provides visitors with the chance to  
 see the shepherd and his dog at work. </content>
