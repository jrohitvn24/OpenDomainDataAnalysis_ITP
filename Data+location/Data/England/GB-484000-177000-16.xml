		<content> In our group we did a survey of the   
 craft activities available in our     
 area. We found out which crafts were  
 the most popular in our famlies.      
 We looked at which craft was enjoyed  
 by diffrent age groups  and we found  
 that sketching was the most popular   
 and metal work was the least popular  
 with one person doing it .We have     
 found out that there are not many     
 craft shops in our area. Most         
 newsagents sells craft books and      
 magazines weekly and monthly.Here are 
 a few craft magazines and books" Work 
 mate" and "Do it" are both wood work  
 magazines and" Sew it" is a sewing    
 magazine.
