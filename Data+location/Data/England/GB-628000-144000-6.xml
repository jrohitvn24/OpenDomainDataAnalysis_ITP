		<content>These are some of the games that       
children in our Primary school         
playground.                            
SKIPPING GAMES :-'Unders and Overs' is 
very poular, the rope is turned and    
you have to jump over and run out      
before being caught. You then turn     
round and run under the rope.          
SITTING GAMES :- 'Chinese Whispers' for
examlpe is when you sit in a circle and
pass a message in the ear of the person
next to you. The idea is to see if the 
message is exactly the same by the time
it gets to the last person.            
RUNNING GAMES :- 'Off Ground Touch' is 
a game where one person is 'on it' and 
the rest run round the playgrond       
without being 'had'. You cannot be     
caught if your feet are off the ground.
