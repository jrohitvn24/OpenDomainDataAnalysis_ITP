		<content>   This rich farming area 8km South of 
 Bristol contains isolated farmsteads, 
 the dispersed village of Ridgehill,   
 and some of Winford and Chew Stoke.   
   Farms are large and mainly rear     
 dairy cattle with sheep and some      
 arable crops. Cider making is a farm  
 activity, the apples being picked from
 small orchards in the area. Patches of
 deciduous woodland add to the variety 
 in the landscape.                     
   Disused quarries reflect past       
 industry but today the Avon Livestock 
 Centre is of regional importance. A   
 garage, inn, glass firm and farm shops
 complete the services available.      
   Those inhabitants not employed in   
 agriculture or services in nearby     
 villages may commute to employment in 
 Bristol, and this is reflected in     
 housing development in the South of   
 Winford.                              </content>
