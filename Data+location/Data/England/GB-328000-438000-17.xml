		<title>17BLACKPOOL SEA CADETS</title>
		<content> In the centre of Bispham is the       
 building where the Sea Cadet Corps    
 meet. Boys and girls between the ages 
 of 12 and 18 may join, and work for   
 badges or promotion - they may become 
 officers after they are 18. All kinds 
 of subjects are studied, such as      
 sailing, shooting, signals, camping,  
 canoeing, rowing and stores. Sailing  
 is studied from an elementary level,  
 right up to being qualified as an     
 instructor; canoeing and rowing are   
 taken at different levels and the     
 stores badge is awarded to cadets who 
 look after the equipment.The boys'    
 parade night is held every Tuesday,the
 girls' night every Thursday, and a    
 joint parade every Friday.There is a  
 small subscription fee. Every Monday  
 the Sea Cadet Band meets to practise, 
 and has a very high reputation at the 
 moment.                               </content>
