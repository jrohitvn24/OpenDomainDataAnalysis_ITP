		<title>11Communications near Baldock</title>
		<content>  Baldock was famous in the 18th       
 century as a staging post for         
 travellers up the Great North Road    
 from London and today national coach  
 companies still retain Baldock as a   
 stop-off point from London to the     
 North.                                
                                       
  A daily coach route from Oxford to   
 Cambridge also passes through Baldock.
                                       
  Within the block, communications are 
 very poor.  Minor roads run through   
 the block to villages outside it.     
 They are narrow and twist about,      
 probably following old enclosure      
 boundaries.                           
                                       
  There are only two telephone boxes   
 and one post box outside Baldock!
