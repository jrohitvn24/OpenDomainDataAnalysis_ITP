		<content>   The main type of farming in the area
  is{dairy farming.}Although from the  
 farms studied in the block other      
 types of farming were arable,cerial{  
 and pig farming. Most of the farms do 
 not specialise in just the one type of
 farming.                              
    The farms varied in size from forty
 acres to 240 acres.The farm of forty  
 acres was previously 80 acres prior to
 the building of the M.56.             
   Some of the farms contained  unusual
 features. E.g. Home Farm has old      
 cock-fighting pens and a dovecote,    
 Pool Bank farm has a motte &amp; bailey   
 Roman site called Watch Hill.One farm 
 also had an ancient berial mound (see 
 fairy brow).                          
   The farmers rely on either relatives
 working on the farm,full time         
 labourers and seasonal labourers.
