		<content> Garton is a tiny village with almost  
 no recreational facilities. There are 
 no sports facilities or village hall. 
 Two organizations, a Darby and Joan   
 Club and Garton Wives meet regularly. 
 A keep fit class meets at the school  
 during the winter months. A           
 questionnaire revealed that a majority
 of people would like a public house   
 and a village hall. It was found that 
 the villagers have a very wide range  
 of hobbies and interests, gardening   
 being by far the most popular.        
 In spite of the poor recreational     
 facilities 82% of the people who      
 answered the questionnaire spend most 
 of their spare time in Garton and 98% 
 like living in the village. About 60% 
 take their holidays in different parts
 of the U.K. while 16% go abroad. The  
 remainder prefer to holiday in Garton.
