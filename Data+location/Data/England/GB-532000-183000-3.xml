		<content>some of the concerns,conflicts and     
opportunities in Islington today.A     
particular effort was made to involve  
people with little or no previous      
experience of this activity.20% of all 
 participants were from ethnic minority
 c ommunities,and 31% lived in council 
accomodation.Of these,64% of the former
and 49% of the latter had 'Never done  
anything like this before'.According to
a report the production 'met and often 
exceeded peoples expectations'.The     
majority (80%) of those responding to  
the survey were seen as very keen to   
participate in more activities.        
Significantly,among those who had had  
no previous experience the level of    
interest was high.The follow up phase  
is aimed to build on the confidence,   
and energy generated by phase one.An   
Arts Association has been formed to    
develop work in the locality.          </content>
