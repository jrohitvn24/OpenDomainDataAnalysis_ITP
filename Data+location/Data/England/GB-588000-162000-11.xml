		<title>11SHOPPING</title>
		<content> The shops go down both sides of the   
 street.There are two modern           
 precincts,one either side,the Forum   
 and the Roman square.Vandals prove a  
 problem in the Forum but the police   
 cannot shut it off every night for it 
 is a public right of way.Shop owners  
 have turned to employing security     
 guards.Ten shops on the last count are
 closed.The market takes place in the  
 old cattle market every Friday and    
 Saturday.Most people like the shops   
 being close together and there is good
 parking space.The elderly would like  
 to see the derelict shops to be       
 re-opened eg.Marks and Spencers,C.and 
 A. etc.The elderly don't use the      
 market because of the crowd but the   
 parents use it regularly.
