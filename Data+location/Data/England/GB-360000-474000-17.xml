		<content>{IN THE PAST}From talking to older     
 people in our village we discovered   
 that the old Fraser Institute,now the 
 estate office, was once a thriving    
 billiards club attended by lots of    
 farm men and villagers. This was also 
 used as a library,and for village     
 meetings and social events. There were
 football,cricket,tennis,and bowling   
 clubs. Over the years these have been 
 abandoned through lack of interest or 
 the falling population.               
{NOWADAYS}We asked people in our survey
 what they did in their spare time.Out 
 of doors, the most popular activity   
 was gardening followed by fell-       
 walking, sport, shooting, photography,
 fishing and sailing. Indoor activities
 included reading, knitting and sewing,
 singing, bellringing, flower          
 arranging,model making, drawing,      
 dancing and television.               </content>
