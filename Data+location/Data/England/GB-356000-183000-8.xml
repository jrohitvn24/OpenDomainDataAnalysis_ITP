 People are all very interested in     
 preserving our heritage and take an   
 active interest in the subject. Many  
 grow plants known to be attractive to 
 wildlife. People are very conscious of
 the threat of Severnside and listen to
 reports on monitoring the pollution.  
 They are interested in the idea that  
 the sum of pollution from all the     
 works may be dangerous while each one 
 on its own is not. In a rural area    
 like this people are concerned about  
 the loss of amenities which will      
 reduce living standards. They wish to 
 keep the village school, station,post 
 office and bus services.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
