		<title>07ST BARNABAS CHURCH, FACCOMBE</title>
		<content> First built about 1860 and renovated  
 several times before 1910. The church,
 which has a square tower, is built of 
 flint. The Churchyard is well kept and
 used as the burial ground.            
 The Lych gate was erected in 1953 as a
 memorial to a previous owner of the   
 Manor, as was the wood panelling in   
 the Chancel. The pipe organ was       
 installed in 1928. The electric blower
 must have been added later.           
 The font is very old. There are two   
 memorial plaques which came from the  
 old church at Netherton.              
 The church is one of four churches of 
 the United Benefice of Hurstbourne    
 Tarrant, where the Vicar lives.       
 Services are held twice a month, Holy 
 communion being celebrated at one of  
 these.                                
 There are two Churchwardens and a     
 Parochial Church Council.             </content>
