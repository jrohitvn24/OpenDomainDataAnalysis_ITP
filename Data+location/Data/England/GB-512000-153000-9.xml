		<title>09Schools in Bookham</title>
		<content> All pre-school playgroups and nursery 
 schools are private, though with      
 falling numbers, many children are    
 starting at first school earlier.     
                                       
 There are 3 first schools; Eastwick,  
 South Bookham and Great Bookham. The  
 children from Gt.Bookham and Eastwick 
 progress to middle school on the same 
 sites, when they are eight. S.Bookham 
 has no middle school, so pupils must  
 choose one of the other schools.      
                                       
 At 12, pupils move to the Howard of   
 Effingham school or another secondary 
 school. Some parents choose to send   
 their children to fee paying schools. 
                                       
 The original Victorian Bookham School 
 is not now used and villagers hope it 
 will become the library. Manor House  
 School is an independant girls school.</content>
