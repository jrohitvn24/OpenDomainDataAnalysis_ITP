 Ladies were here so their families    
 could go on holiday.                  
 Some have no relatives so they hardly 
 ever go out.                          
 But once they all went to Whitley Bay.
                                       
 We asked one lady why she decided to  
 live here.                            
 She said "Do you know I've never      
 ridden a bike before in my life."     
 We tried again.                       
                                       
 "I couldn't manage on my own," she    
 replied.                              
 And we all knew it was true.          
 "I couldn't manage on my own," she    
 said again.                           
 "but my sons are doing very well."    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
