		<title>17A FAMILY SUNDAY</title>
		<content>  My name is Chloe and I am 11 years   
 old.I have a sister who is 9.         
 This is a typical Sunday in the life  
 of my family.We usually get up at     
 about 9.30 am.but sometimes dad has to
 be up by 5.0 am.in order to go to work
 because he is on shifts.Our dad works 
 at the I.C.I.factory.Our mum doesn't  
 go to work because she has to look    
 after my sister and me.               
   We play outside if it is a nice day 
 but if it's raining, we play quiz     
 games or practise our violin and      
 cello.We have dinner at 12.30.It is   
 usually a snack but sometimes we have 
 a Sunday dinner consisting of roast   
 beef or chicken,roast potatoes,carrots
 and peas,pudding or fruit.After dinner
 we go and play or read books.I don't  
 like the washing-up. We have tea about
 5.0 pm.Then we stay inside and watch  
 t.v.Bedtime is about 8.0 pm.          </content>
