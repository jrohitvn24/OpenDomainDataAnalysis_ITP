		<content>   My name is Mark. I enjoy programming
 the 64K Commodore computer which I    
 keep in my bedroom on a special table.
 Besides the keyboard and processor I  
 have a cassette player for loading    
 programmes and use a T.V. set as a    
 video display unit. I also have some  
 joysticks. I type in small educational
 programmes for my younger sister. I   
 share the computer with my Dad who    
 uses it for his business; for stock-  
 taking and calculating profit margins.
   Every couple of weeks I go with my  
 friend to a computer shop in Ringwood 
 to buy a new computer game. The shop  
 assistant advises us which game to    
 buy. When we get home we load in the  
 new game and sometimes play all day.  
 At the moment my favourites are the   
 adventure games "The Hobbit" and "The 
 Impossible Mission."
