		<title>10WEAVING IN GRAFFHAM</title>
		<content> I saw a weaver who began because she  
 wanted to create something.  She      
 taught herself to weave a rug.  She   
 has been weaving for 33 years and     
 weaves daily.  It takes between 20 &amp;  
 72 hours t make a rug, and some       
 patterns are very complicated.  They  
 are inspired by the country-side.     
 They dye wools with walnuts which make
 browns and fawns, onion skins which   
 make yellows and oranges, and indigo  
 which make purples and blues.  They   
 also use chemical dyes.  There are at 
 least 7 large floor looms to weave    
 rugs on and several table looms for   
 smaller pieces.  Each large loom costs
 Â£700 to Â£1000.  Evening &amp; day courses 
 are organised when people can weave   
 and dye.  You can buy rugs, cushion   
 covers, scarves &amp; lots more. I like   
 the knot rugs which she makes because 
 they are less tiring to work on.      </content>
