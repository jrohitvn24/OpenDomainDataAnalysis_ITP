		<content>   The first{station}at St.David's was 
 opened in 1844; the present buildings 
 were completed in 1914. During the    
 first half of 1985 multi-aspect       
 signalling has been introduced,       
 controlled from a{new power box.}This 
 box controls the signalling on the    
 main line from near Taunton to Totnes.
 It{replaces 30 mechanical boxes,}cost 
 Â£850,000 and is operated by 4         
 signalmen. At the same time the track 
 layout at St.David's has been         
 simplified, and made more versatile;  
 many conflicting movements have been  
 eliminated.                           
   Almost{400 people}work at the       
 station including 102 guards and 200  
 drivers. The station has 251 passenger
 and parcel arrivals and departures on 
 a weekday. A new Travel Centre has    
 just opened at a cost of Â£280,000.
