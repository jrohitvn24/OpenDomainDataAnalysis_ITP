		<content> Apart from the modern housing estates,
 and a small amount of development on  
 the Kirton and Falkenham road, the    
 area is rural and mainly flat except  
 in the area of the Sink.There are both
 old and modern barns and farm         
 buildings scattered over the          
 landscape. The land slopes gently down
 to river level and the low lying land 
 has been drained by dykes.            
 The River Deben is contained by high  
 wide earth banks which have recently  
 been reviewed and strengthened.       
 On the riverside mud flats are        
 revealed at low tide and in the river 
 itself there are moorings for many    
 small craft.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
