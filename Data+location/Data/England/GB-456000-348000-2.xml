 There are 120 children,5 teachers a   
 headteacher and 7 dinner ladies  in   
 school.It is a{small junior and infant
 school.We leave when we are 11 to go  
 to a comprehensive school.Our school  
 is surrounded by countryside.We cover 
 many{subjects,}art, maths, topic,     
 language,P.E.and music.We come to     
 school on a Trent bus and arrive at   
 8.30am.Leasons begin at 9.00 and      
 finish at 3.30pm.We have an area of   
 grass and a small playground to play  
 on at playtimes.We have lunch in the  
 school hall at 12.00.My favourite     
 dinner is curry,rice and peas followed
 by jam roly poly.Then we go onto the  
{Pingle}to play. The{Pingle}is our     
 field.I like the school because it is 
 built in a lovely area with wildlife  
 and countryside all around.
