		<title>01INDUSTRY IN KEIGHLEY</title>
		<content>  Industry in the Keighley area has    
 historically been based on the        
 availability of water for both power  
 and for use in various processes in   
 the{textile industry.}Today the{      
{textile industry}has declined as the  
 major employer in the area with many  
 mill closures being forced by a lack  
 of demand for domestically produced   
 wool and cotton products.             
      In {1985}approximately {60%}of   
 Keighley's working population are     
 employed in{tertiary}industries such  
 as Airedale Hospital,British Telecom, 
 Local Administation and Retailing.    
{Secondary industry}employs about{38%} 
 of the workforce in firms like Peter  
 Black's and Magnet and Southern's.{   
{Primary industries}such as Farming and
 Quarrying employ the remainder.Many   
 Keighley people commute daily to work 
 in Bradford and Leeds.                </content>
