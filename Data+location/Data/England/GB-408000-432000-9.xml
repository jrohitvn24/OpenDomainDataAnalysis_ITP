 land cover is{housing.}               
 All the people have cars, as there is 
 no public transport.Most people have  
 telephones, because there are no      
 public phoneboxes.The nearest         
 amenities are in Thornton village.The 
 only leisure facility is a riding     
 stable.The people have to organise    
 their own leisure or go into Thornton.
  As the primary land cover is farmland
 there are a lot of farmhouses. However
  houses are slowly being built.7 out  
 of 10 people find life boring in this 
 square.The others like living in this 
 area.{
