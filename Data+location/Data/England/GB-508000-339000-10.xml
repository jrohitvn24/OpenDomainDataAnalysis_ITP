 about 130 acres of land with his      
 brother David.Most of the land is used
 for growing crops but he has 4        
 bullocks in a paddock by the house.Hay
 is grown for his own stock and the    
 surplus is sold.Other crops grown are 
 grain ,sugar beet,beans and           
 oil seed rape.He gets up about 5.30   
 and returns home for breakfast at     
 9.30.Followed by a quick visit each   
 day to his elderly mother who is      
 92 he works again until 12.30 has     
 dinner and goes back to work.This     
 means tractor driving,constructing    
 new buildings, hay making etc.        
 After tea he works in the garden      
 watches a favourite TV programme and  
 goes to bed early.
