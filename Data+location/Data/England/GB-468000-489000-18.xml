		<title>18Sarkless Kitty of Gillamoor</title>
		<content> Kitty Garthwaite of Gillamoor was     
 engaged to Willie Dixon from Hutton le
 Hole. On Whitsunday 1787, they        
 quarrelled and he abandoned her at    
 Lowna. Next morning her body clad only
 in a white sark,was found in the river
 there. Meanwhile the repentant Willie 
 rode to York for a marriage licence.  
 Upon his return the body and sark were
 missing.He searched unsuccessfully and
 the next day his body was discovered  
 in the same pool. Three weeks later,  
 local children saw Kitty's naked      
 apparition, and over the next twenty  
 years,sixteen men drowned in that     
 pool.Kitty's ghost was finally laid by
 book and candle in 1809. A possible   
 explanation is that a Quaker couple,  
 wishing to spare Kitty a crossroads   
 burial,then traditional for suicides, 
 secretly buried her with their        
 daughter at Lowna Quaker Burial Ground</content>
