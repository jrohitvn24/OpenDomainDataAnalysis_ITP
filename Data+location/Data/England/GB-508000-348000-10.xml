 the Lincolnshire Education Authority  
 are investigating the falling role in 
 the local schools.                    
                  There have recently  
 been meetings in many of the schools  
 with parents listening to the         
 authority plus putting over their own 
 ideas on how the education of their   
 children should be conducted.         
                 The local people      
 belive that one of the rural schools  
 may have to close.
