		<content> There is a great variety of landscape 
 from woodland to industrial areas.Adel
 has changed very much from a bog to a 
 community.                            
 A small area of woodland houses many  
 different kinds of vegetation,but is  
 called "The Hollies"because there are 
 many coniferous trees.Although dogs   
 are walked here,there is everything   
 from ants to foxes.The stream down the
 middle contains sticklebacks,bullheads
 and caddis fly larvae.                
 From open fields you can see a        
 dense,built-up city and wonder what   
 will happen to the fields in the next 
 ten years.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
