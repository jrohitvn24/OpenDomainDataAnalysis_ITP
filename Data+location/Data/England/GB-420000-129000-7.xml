		<title>07FARLEY'S HISTORIC BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> Farley is on the edge of Clarendon    
 Forest,an ancient wood that used to   
 cover most of the area. Farley means  
{"far meadow".}There are some older    
 houses, but the most notable buildings
 are the Church, Wardenry and          
 Almshouses.                           
 These were paid for by Sir Stephen    
 Fox, an advisor to king Charles II and
 later a member of Parliament for      
 Salisbury. He was born in Farley and  
 bought the estate here. The Wardenry, 
 originally the vicarage, was built in 
 1681. The architect was Alexander     
 Fort, an associate of Sir Christopher 
 Wren.                                 
 The buildings are of red brick. The   
 church has five stained glass windows.
 The Wardenry, although a simple       
 outward design, has attractive oak    
 panelling and elaborate plaster       
 ceilings inside.                      </content>
