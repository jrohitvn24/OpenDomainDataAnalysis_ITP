		<title>05Surrey Docks city farm.</title>
		<content>At surrey Docks farm there are animals 
but it is not a farm where they plough 
fields. The farm is in what was once   
Surrey Docks,next to the River Thames  
It is                                  
a city farm The farm is 10 years old   
(it was started in 1975.) The farm  is 
just over an acre.It was set up so     
that people who live in cities can see 
what a farm is like.There are          
these animals on the farm :11 geese, 24
goats 50 hens, 2 donkeys, 6 ducks, 2   
pigs,2 sheeps , and 5 rabbits .        
There is a stoney hill.it has a        
little pond  where the ducks are.      
The chickens are put away at night     
because the fox might eat them. The    
geese do not have to be put away       
because they stay close together. They 
sell their produce which is meat,      
eggs, goats milk, youhurt and soft     
cheese.                                </content>
