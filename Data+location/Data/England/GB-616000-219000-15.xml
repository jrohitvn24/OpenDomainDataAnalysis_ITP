		<title>15LITTLE CLACTON FUN RUN</title>
		<content> Little Clacton Fun Run took place on  
 Sunday 19th May. The weather was fine 
 and sunny &amp; there was a choice of a 13
 or a six &amp; a half mile course. There  
 were 45 runners for the 13 mile course
 of which 12-14 were juniors &amp; for the 
 shorter course there were 115. Among  
 these were 40 children from a local   
 junior school with their teacher.     
 On the longer course all but three    
 people finished &amp; for the other they  
 all completed it. Most of the people  
 who ran were sponsored for different  
 charities.                            
 A shield was being awarded for the    
 best sponge station &amp; we won it. We   
 were dressed up as 'All sports for all
 sorts' because the boys were dressed  
 as girls &amp; the girls as boys. I was a 
 rugby player, but I was glad I was    
 helping &amp; not actually running.
