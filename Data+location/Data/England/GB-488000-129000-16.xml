		<title>16PEOPLES ATTITUDES</title>
		<content>    I interviewed a couple in our area 
 and found out their attitude to life. 
 These are their comments.             
    People have forgotten how to look  
 after things. They have no respect for
 life or property. I think the country 
 is going from bad to worse. There are 
 no tradesmen left. Vandalism and      
 mugging are getting worse. Peoples    
 attitudes to each other need to be    
 changed.                              
                                       
    Most of the people in our area are 
 middle class, conservative in their   
 outlook and with a large proportion of
 retired and older people. They are    
 interested in preserving amenities.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
