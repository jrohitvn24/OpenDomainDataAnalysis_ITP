 gently undulating form in the lee of a
 sandstone escarpement. Much of the    
 land used for growing crops, cattle   
 and other pasture. The most prominent 
 residential area village within the   
 block is that of Bobbington in the    
 South west corner and towards the     
 centre a large area is covered bbyy a 
 private civil aerodrome at Halfpenny  
 Green. Some quarying has taken place  
 in the Eastern side of the block, this
 is now being filled, at present and   
 used as a golf course. A popular      
 commuting area for the West midlands.
