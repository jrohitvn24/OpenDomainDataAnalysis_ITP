		<title>10A Weekend Day</title>
		<content> On Sunday the day starts off slowly,  
 not like in the week when we have to  
 rush to get ready for school! When the
 whole family is awake we decide what  
 to do for the day . Often we phone a  
 friend to see what his family is doing
 and arrange the day together. One     
 Sunday after our bacon and egg break  
 fast, we met our friends and walked   
 the dogs across Southport and Birkdale
 golf links. We threw sticks for the   
 dogs to fetch. There is a large pond  
 nearby where there are Natterjack     
 toads;it was here we stopped to have a
 picnic. After eating,we played French 
 cricket. At 2pm. we went  home to wash
 and change for a birthday tea for my  
 Great Grandma who was 90 years old.   
 There were many relatives there. We   
 had a lovely tea-party and everybody  
 sang Happy Birthday when Grandma cut  
 the cake.                             </content>
