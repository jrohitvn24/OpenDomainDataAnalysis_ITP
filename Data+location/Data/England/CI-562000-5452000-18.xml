		<title>18A Jersey Farm</title>
		<content>      I live on a farm in St. Lawrence,
 Jersey. My dad grows crops, potatoes  
 to export to England, mangolds and    
 kale for cattle feed in the winter. We
 have nine fields and they were all    
 recorded in the 1985 Domesday survey. 
 We have sixteen cows, two bulls, six  
 heifers, five cats and one dog.       
      We have a big farmhouse with an  
 old arch, all made of granite. All the
 water we use comes from a well. We    
 used to have pigs, chickens and       
 rabbits. There was a big garden where 
 the new shed is now and apple trees   
 grew all around our house. Probably   
 the apples were used to make cider.   
      My dad has lived at our farm all 
 his life. My grandfather lived there  
 too. I think my great grandfather     
 built the farm.
