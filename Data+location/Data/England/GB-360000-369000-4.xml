		<content> The present owner has lived on the    
 farm for 20 years.  The farmer has 80 
 milking cows, 27 large heifers and 29 
 other cows.  Approximately 85 calves  
 are born each year.  Some are sold but
 most are kept.  The owner also grows  
 cereals - wheat and barley.  The wheat
 is sold and the barley is kept for    
 winter feed.                          
 The farm consists of 278 acres.  This 
 includes all the cows' fields and all 
 the cereal fields.  There are 120     
 acres for cereals and 130 acres of    
 grassland.  The remaining acres are   
 waste and woodland.                   
 There are 85-90 tonnes of fertilizers 
 used each year, 30 tonnes of nitrogen 
 and 60 tonnes of other compounds.  The
 owner does not mind using fertilizers 
 and weedkillers because the soil is   
 very sandy with little goodness but   
 excellent drainage.                   </content>
