		<title>19Chatteris - Fun Run</title>
		<content> Wednesday 26th June was quite an      
 exciting day for some people.  There  
 was to be a Mini Fun Run around the   
 town.  Among the people entering was  
 Cannon David Towers, changing from    
 robes to running shorts.              
                                       
 They started from Chatteris Football  
 Club in West Street, near the bypass. 
 They ran right around the town and    
 back to the field where they did as   
 many laps as they could.  The winner  
 was Jonny Allen who completed it in   
 about fifteen minutes.  One runner,   
 whose name was Dave Mills, had an     
 unfortunate encounter with a BMX      
 cycle.  He continued for a while but  
 had to drop out.                      
                                       
 Young and not so young people entered 
 and thoroughly enjoyed themselves     
 working up quite a sweat.             </content>
