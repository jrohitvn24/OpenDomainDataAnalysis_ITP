 old wharf building at the end of the  
 Oakham to Melton canal. It was        
 converted into the Barraclough Hall in
 1953. It didn't have very good        
 facilities, so in 1984{OAKHAM SCHOOL  
 decided to reconstruct it interior.The
 new theatre now has improved equipment
 such as: sound and lighting rooms,    
 bars and fully equiped dressing rooms.
 Sloping upwards from the stage there  
 are fixed seats. The theatre has a    
 seating capacity for 220 people.      
     The theatre was opened by the{    
{QUEEN }in November 1984, (the school's
 quatercentenery).Since then a variety 
 of plays and musicals have been       
 performed.
