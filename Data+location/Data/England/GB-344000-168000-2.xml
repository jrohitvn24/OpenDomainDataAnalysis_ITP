		<title>02Local History of Nailsea</title>
		<content> When the old{ Domesday Book}was       
 created,{Nailsea}was under another    
 name.{Nailsea}originated from{        
{Nigel,}who owned the land then.       
 Today,{Nailsea}is mainly a{residential
 area ; acting as a{"dormitory"}suburb 
 for the many Nailsea residents who    
 work in Bristol.                      
 The majority of people travelling to  
 Bristol go by their own transport,    
 such as car or motorcycle.Some other  
 people go by bus or train for a       
 farther destination.                  
 Modern Nailsea started to grow very   
 fast in the late 1950's and early     
 1960's. It had a{modern clinic,       
{library}and{shopping centre}before    
 most of the new houses were built.
