		<title>17CHURCH STRETTON LIBRARY</title>
		<content>   The library building was built in   
{1861.}The materials used to build it  
 were stone and brick. Before the      
 building was a library it was a school
 for all aged children.                
   Quite a few years later a new       
 primary and comprehensive school was  
 built so there was an empty building  
 which became the library.             
   It opened in{1968.}It serves most   
 areas around Stretton and opens on    
 Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and      
 Saturday.                             
   The library is up to date with a    
 microfisch which tells you what books 
 are available. The most popular books 
 seem to be historical ones. It also   
 lends records.                        
   There is an{information centre}in   
 the library building. This gives      
 information on the area such as       
 interesting places to visit.          </content>
