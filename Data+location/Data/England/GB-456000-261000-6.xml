		<content> Almost 180 companies registered       
themselves on a list of Daventry's     
companies compiled by the Council      
Estates Dept. this year. The vast      
majority of these occupy units on the  
two big industrial estates- Long March 
and Royal Oak. The few others occupy   
individual sites around the town.      
 Most companies in Daventry have been  
established here in the last 20 years  
(many in the last 5), but a few have   
been here longer e.g. White &amp; Co (still
involved in the "traditional" footwear 
industry), the BBC, and British Timken.
 The newer companies are very varied   
both in size and business. Three of    
the biggest employers in the town      
(with hundreds on each payrole) are:-  
Ford Motor Co, a massive distributor &amp; 
training cetre for the car company;    
Cummins, who make &amp; export diesel      
engines all over the world;    (cont 7)</content>
