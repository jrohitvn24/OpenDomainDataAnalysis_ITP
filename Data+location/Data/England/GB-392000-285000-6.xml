		<content> There are many different aspects of   
 school education in this area today.  
 The pupils come from a variety of     
 economic backgrounds although         
 comparatively there are no pupils very
 poor or very rich.  Our school is a   
 very modern building with good        
 educational facilities.  The rooms are
 large enough to take the tables,      
 chairs and pupils, although the colour
 schemes are very dull and grey.  we   
 are lucky enough to have carpets in   
 the classrooms and along most         
 corridors.  Sports facilities are     
 excellent and music is very good too. 
 The curriculum includes all of the    
 important subjects like Maths,        
 English, Humanities and Sciences. We  
 also do Religious Studies I think this
 subject ought to be taught because we 
 not only learn about the Christian    
 faith but other religions too.        </content>
