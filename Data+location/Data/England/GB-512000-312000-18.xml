		<title>18THE VICAR &amp; CHURCH LANGTOFT</title>
		<content> The church was built of limestone in  
 the 12 hundreds.The vicar is fairly   
 new.He has four  churches,they        
 are Langtoft,Baston,Wilsthorpe and    
 Braceborough.In langtoft they have    
 about 7 weddings and 5 funerals and 5 
 christanings a year.On a Sunday       
 the reverend John Duckett has to do   
 four services,first he does a service 
 at Langtoft for an hour then he goes  
 home for a little time then he goes   
 over to Baston then at 12 o'clock he  
 goes home for lunch he has a rest then
 goes over to Wilsthorpe for a service 
 at Braceborough.He has a very long day
 on a Sunday.The church was built      
 because people want to pray in a      
 civilized manner,in a beautiful       
 building dedicated to God.
