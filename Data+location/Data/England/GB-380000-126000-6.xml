		<title>06A FAMILY DAY IN GILLINGHAM</title>
		<content> Home life is most important at        
 weekends,when members of the family   
 see more of each other.Most families  
 have three meals a day.Mealtimes are  
 usually later at the weekends.Many    
 children have breakfast by themselves,
 and usually the whole family are      
 together only for the main meal of the
 day.Sometimes children go shopping    
 with their mothers,but otherwise spend
 much of the day playing with their    
 friends or watching television.Many   
 families have more than one television
 set,and most children watch during the
 day and before going to bed.Most      
 families do not see a lot of their    
 relatives:usually one visit a week is 
 made by a close relative,often for    
 afternoon tea.Most children say they  
 enjoy their home life.
