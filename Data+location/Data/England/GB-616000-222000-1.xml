		<title>01THORPE-LE-SOKEN DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> THORPE-LE-SOKEN IS A FAIRLY LARGE     
 VILLAGE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FARMING    
 AREA. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THERE HAS 
 BEEN SOME RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT BUT 
 ONCE THE LANDERMERE GREEN ESTATE IS   
 COMPLETED THERE WILL ONLY BE INFILL   
 BUILDING PERMITTED FOR THE FORSEEABLE 
 FUTURE. THERE ARE MANY ATTRACTIVE OLD 
 HOUSES IN THE AREA AND RECENTLY A WELL
 KNOWN LOCAL BUILDING FIRM, THOMAS WEBB
 AND SONS, HAS TIDIED UP THE HIGH      
 STREET BY RENOVATING TWO SETS OF      
 DILAPIDATED COTTAGES. PROPERTY IN     
 THORPE TENDS TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN
 IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS DUE TO THE   
 POPULARITY OF THE VILLAGE AND THE EASY
 ACCESS BY ROAD AND RAIL TO LONDON. IT 
 HAS A WIDE RANGE OF SHOPS, INCLUDING A
 CHEMIST, AND SERVES AS A CENTRE FOR   
 THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES OF TENDRING, 
 STONES GREEN AND BEAUMONT-CUM MOZE. 5 
 OF ITS SHOPS ARE ANTIQUE SHOPS.       </content>
