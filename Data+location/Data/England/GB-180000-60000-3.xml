 income for Newquay.It has many fine   
 beaches,beautiful scenery and quaint  
 villages-which attract people from all
 over the country.                     
                                       
    Newquay is well known for surfing. 
 The European Surfing Championships    
 were held here in 1983.This proved to 
 be so successful that it may become   
 an annual event.                      
                                       
    There are many gift shops,'rock    
 shops',souvenir shops and cafes-a     
 large proportion of which close for   
 the winter.

 guest house,hotel or youth hostel-

 large number of seasonal jobs.
