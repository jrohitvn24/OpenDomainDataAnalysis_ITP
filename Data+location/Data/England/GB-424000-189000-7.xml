		<title>07Farming at Broadleaze Farm</title>
		<content>Broadleaze Farm in our 'D' block covers
180 acres.The farm specialises in beef 
cattle.Mr Cripps the owner,has lived in
the 350 year old farmhouse for 2.5     
years.There are 106 head of cattle on  
the farm at the moment,when they are   
1.5 to 2 years old they are sold to the
butchers .It cost 150 pounds to buy    
a calf but hopefully when sold will    
rise 400 pounds.The cattle are mainly  
Hereford cross and Friesians.When sold 
a fully grown animal weighs            
approximately 400 kg.On this farm      
Mr.Cripps keeps 73 acres of grass for  
the cattle and another 90 acres of     
wheat which he harvested and sold.It   
costs approximately 70,000 pounds a    
year to run the farm.As Broadleaze farm
is not a dairy farm he finds it easier 
to leave the cattle and he doesn't have
to get up too early in the mornings.
