		<title>16    Power Station</title>
		<content>    This Power Station is in East Cowes
 and can be seen very clearly from the 
 school.  We visited the site on 16th  
 July and saw Mr Fisher.  Here are the 
 questions that we asked him about the 
 station.                              
                                       
   1). How much Power do you use a day?
            {140 Megawatts             
   2). How many people do you employ?  
             { 8 people work here      
   3). What sort of electricity do you 
       produce?                        
       {Electricity is the same        
{       everywhere.  All power stations
{       feed the National Grid and     
{       people take power from this    
{       Grid. }                        
   4). How old is the building?        
       {It was started in 1978 and     
{       finished in 1982 }             
                                       </content>
