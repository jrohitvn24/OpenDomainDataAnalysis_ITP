		<title>12Haddon Hall</title>
		<content>    In 1087  Haddon  Hall  was owned by
 William  Peverel,   whose  father  was
{William the Conqueror.} In 1153 it was
 passed to the Avenel family.   Then in
 1170  the  Vernon family took it over.
 It has  belonged to their descendants,
 the  Manners  family, since 1567.  The
 present owner  is  the Duke of Rutland
 who lives at{Belvoir Castle.          
    Today  Haddon  Hall is  open to the
 public every day during the summer. It
 is  interesting  because  it is a fine
 example  of  a Tudor house, containing
 pictures, furniture and{tapestries.   
    In addition  to the income from the
 paying public,  Haddon Hall is still a
 profitable  farm  and  receives  extra
 income  through  the  sale  of fishing
 rights on the {River Wye}and  shooting
 rights from the surrounding land.
