		<content> A goad is a whip or a stick measuring 
 13 feet and used for prodding cattle  
 to move forward. it is interesting to 
 note that most cottages built about   
 this time had rooms measuring 13 feet.
 The furniture would have been very    
 plain an simple and made of wood. The 
 windows in the cottage are small      
 because of the superstition that the  
 deavil would not come throught small  
 windows. Each house has a living room,
 kitchen and bedroom. It was usual for 
 families to be large. The children    
 would have to sleep in the parents    
 room or in the loft. there are two    
 wells in the garden of Cherrycroft    
 cottage. Mrs. meller does not use the 
 well water. The well a covered over.  
 Cherrycroft cottage is now a single   
 house for Mrs. meller who has lived   
 there for 10 years.
