		<content> Several types of recreation are       
 pursued around the area. Walking is a 
 favourtite pastime with most of the   
 population and there are some good    
 footpaths especially along the banks  
 of the Oxford Canal.                  
                                       
 Boating is very popular on the Canal  
 in summer when the water becomes      
 crowded with narrow barges which can  
 be hired locally.                     
                                       
 There is a recreation ground in the   
 village where games of football are   
 played between local teams.           
                                       
 The air base has a large sports centre
 but this is only used by military     
 personnel.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
