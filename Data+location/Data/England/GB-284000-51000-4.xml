		<title>04DARTMOUTH FERRIES (1)</title>
		<content>     There are{three}ferries that run  
 between Dartmouth and Kingswear. They 
 replace the{"Mew",}a large coal_fired 
 vessel (later converted to oil) which 
 used to carry both cars and passengers
 between the pontoons. There is        
 evidence that there has been a        
 crossing point here since{1365.       
{  The Higher Car Ferry}(built 1960) is
 propelled by two large paddle wheels  
 and guided along two steel cables. It 
 can carry up to 18 cars, or 4 coaches,
 and runs every 15 minutes.            
  {The Lower Car Ferry}is pulled by    
 one of three diesel tugs: Hauley 2    
 (made at Percy Mitchels Yard,         
 Mevagissy) Hauleys 4 and 5 (made      
 at Philips of Dartmouth). Each ferry  
 can carry up to 8 cars every 20       
 minutes. Two ferries are used during  
 the summer months.
