		<title>02A SCHOOL DAY AT BITTESWELL.</title>
		<content> Nearly all the primary age children in
 our block attends St. Mary's Church   
 of England Aided School.There are     
 about 70 in all.Two thirds of them    
 live too far away to walk,so most of  
 them come on a school bus,although a  
 few are brought by car.               
 We have to be at the bus stop at 8.30 
 or 8.40 depending which village we    
 live in.The bus usually gets to school
 by 8.55 except if it breaks down or it
 is icy or snowy.The journey is from   
 Frolesworth to Leire to Ashby Parva to
 school.                               
 School starts at 9.00,play is from    
 10,30. to 10.45.,sandwich is from     
 12.00 to 1.30., and school finishes at
 3.30.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
