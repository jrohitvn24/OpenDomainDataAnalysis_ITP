		<content>  We visited two farms in the block one
 near Wroxeter and the other on        
 Charlton Hill.                        
  {MR BEDDOES' FARM, EYTON-ON-SEVERN}  
  The farm has four main products, corn
 sugar beet, potatoes and sheep. There 
 is 400 acres of ploughing land and 70 
 acres of grass and buildings. There   
 are only four farm hands who work on  
 the farm so Mr Beddoes has many       
 machines to save labour. There are    
 several tractors, ploughs, a potato   
 harvester, seed drills, a combined    
 harvester , a baler and a corn dryer. 
  {MR DAVIES' FARM, CHARLTON HILL      
  Mr Davies' main product is pigs and  
 there are over 500 of them as well as 
 some sheep and cattle. The main crops 
 are corn and sugar beet which are     
 grown on the 300 acres. Mr Davies only
 has one farm hand so he also has  many
 machines to help with the work.       </content>
