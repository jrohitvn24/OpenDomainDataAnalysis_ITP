		<content> We went to interview{Mr Mason,}the    
 headteacher. He was very helpful and  
 showed us the first {Log Book} of the 
 school. It opened as {Grinlow School} 
 in{1876}with a head and two teachers  
 You can see the old school and school 
 master's house opposite the Park Inn; 
 today High Peak College use it. The   
 Junior School moved to Trent Avenue in
 1951 when the council estate was built
 and it was enlarged in{1975}to cope   
 with the children from the new Foxlow 
 estate. Today, there are{274 children 
 and{10 teachers;}nine classes in      
 Harpur Hill and one teacher and 11    
 children at Chelmorton School. A      
 caretaker &amp; two cleaners look after   
 the school. When we visited the top   
 two classes had just returned from a  
 school journey to the {Isle of Wight.
