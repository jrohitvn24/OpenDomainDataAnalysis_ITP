		<title>10MY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> 75 children attend this school from   
 5 to 9 yrs old.  I leave this         
 September.  Mrs. Hayward teaches my   
 class.  Mrs. Scott teaches class one  
 and Mrs. Dredge has class two.        
 Mr. Nolan is the Headmaster. He takes 
 everone for reading and other lessons.
 Mrs. Shearman is the Secretary.       
 We have a swimming pool. In summer we 
 use it every day. Girls play netball  
 with our dinner lady and the boys play
 football.  We like our play boat, sand
 pit and play bars.  We enjoy country  
 dancing and our May pole.  Our class  
 uses Fletcher, Lomond and Hesse maths 
 books.  Mrs. Brooker our caretaker    
 keeps the school very clean. Two      
 dinner ladies serve us and Mrs. Overy 
 helps the children.                   
 We have just bought a second computer.
 We watch some television programmes.
