		<title>13Haddenham Shops Described</title>
		<content> There are{24 shops}in Haddenham.{12 of
{them are food shops}and the others are
 Florist, Chemist, Hairdresser,        
 Electrical/TV, Hardware, Craft,       
 Carpets, Betting, Drapers, Newsagent, 
 Post Office and Off Licence.          
 Some of the shops are in very old     
 buildings which give them a lot of    
 character. The{Beehive}in Churchway   
 used to be a public house before 1834 
 and was then converted into a shop. It
 housed the{Post Office}for a while,   
 but this is now further up Churchway. 
 The Bakery has been used for the same 
 purpose for 200 years. There has been 
 a butchers in Station Road for the    
 same period. Over the last 50 years   
 many shops have changed their function
 and older villagers remember shops no 
 longer in existance. Haddenham is     
 fortunate to have retained so many    
 shops that offer a friendly service.  </content>
