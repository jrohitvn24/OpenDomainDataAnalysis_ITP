		<content> St Martins church was restored and    
 re-built in{1882/83.}Much of the old  
 church was kept.In the{19th century   
 ,during rebuilding several old stones 
 were found including fragments of a   
 cross shaft and cross heads dating    
 back to{850}to{1000}AD.Flat grave     
 covers from the 13th century are built
 into the Vestry, chancel and the porch
 The two Norman arches still exist.    
 Identification of the person buried is
 carved on graves e.g. priest-a chalice
 and missal.Although no trace of a     
 building has been found it is thought 
 that a church existed on this site-The
 9th century.The vicar is the Rev.     
 D. Moore who has been here for 13     
 years.St Hillary's church Picton is   
 the daughter church of St Martin.It   
 was built with brick and covered in   
 plaster.It does not have a licence    
 for burial or a graveyard.            </content>
