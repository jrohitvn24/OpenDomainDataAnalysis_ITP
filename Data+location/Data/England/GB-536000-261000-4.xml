		<content>   We travelled to the other two       
 villages in our area.                 
   Lolworth is a tiny "cul-de-sac"     
 village and we had a small part of it 
 in our block,just a few houses and a  
 farm.The farm is also a riding school.
 Lolworth is a very old village but    
 there has been a few new houses built 
 there in recent years.The village has 
 been developed ribbonly along two or  
 three roads.                          
   Both Lolworth and Dry Drayton were  
 originally developed as agricultural  
 villages.Today,although some of the   
 residents do work on local farms,they 
 are mainly dormitory villages for     
 Cambridge.
