 Most people had come from other parts 
 of England.  They travelled by Coach, 
 car bus, train, ferry or hovercraft.  
 Many tourists were not staying in the 
 West Wight, they were on day trips.   
 Most people liked the West Wight's    
 beautiful countryside, the sea, and   
 the uncommerciallised beaches.  The   
 weather was bad so many people said   
 they didn't like the wind and rain so 
 no one had been swimming.  The things 
 people didn't like were the stones and
 the buildings close to the sea.  Most 
 tourists didn't want to go home.
