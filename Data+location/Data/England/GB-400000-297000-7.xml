		<title>07WALSALL MARKET</title>
		<content> Dating from{C12}with a{Royal Charter, 
{Walsall Market}winds down a hill      
 between the shops from{St Matthews    
{Church}to the town centre. It is an   
{open air}market with canvas covered   
 stalls which sell almost everything.  
 Open on Monday,Tuesdays,Fridays and   
 Saturdays,it is noisy and crowded with
 a superb atmosphere, as the friendly  
 stall holders shout their wares in all
 kinds of weather. There are over{100  
{stalls,}and many have been in the same
 family for centuries. Most stall      
 holders are{Midlanders}but a few come 
 from as far as{London}and{Burnley.    
 They arrive at 6.30am,start trading at
 8.00am and finish at 5.00pm.Customers 
 come from the local area and on the   
 day we surveyed,visitors had come from
{Australia}and the{U.S.A.}It is not    
 certain whether the new supermarket   
 development will affect market trade. </content>
