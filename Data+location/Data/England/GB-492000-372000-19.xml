		<content> Road, rail and waterways all pass     
 through our area. The major road is   
 the A57 joining Lincoln to Saxilby.   
 This has been improved with the bends 
 removed. Minor roads join the villages
 of Skellingthorpe and Burton to this  
 main road. The new Lincoln Relief Road
 passes through the south of our area  
 and includes bridge constructions to  
 cross the Fossdyke and Railway close  
 to the Pyewipe Inn. An elevated       
 section then crosses farm land to the 
 corner of Long Leys Road. The road is 
 expected to be opened in 1986. The    
 Railway line from Lincoln to          
 Gainsborough passes close to the      
 Fossdyke Canal. Crossing the canal by 
 road is only possible at Saxilby or   
 Lincoln. This has cut the area into   
 two sections.
