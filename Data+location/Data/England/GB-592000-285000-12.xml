		<title>12Changes in Bridgham</title>
		<content> Bridgham has changed greatly over the 
 last 50 years.   Before the last war, 
 nearly all the inhabitants worked in  
 or around the village - as farm or    
 forestry workers.   Most were Bridgham
 born, or came from nearby villages and
 lived in council or tied houses.      
 Much more land was used for cattle and
 sheep and fewer machines were used, so
 much labour was required.  Families   
 were larger too.  The church was well 
 attended and Bridgham had its own     
 Rector, not shared with East Harling, 
 as now.                               
                                       
 The village had two general stores and
 a Post Office.  Most people shopped   
 here, or in East Harling.  Transport  
 to Thetford was difficult and         
 villagers walked or used bikes.  A    
 wealthy few had cars.  Bridgham was   
 then a fairly self sufficient village.</content>
