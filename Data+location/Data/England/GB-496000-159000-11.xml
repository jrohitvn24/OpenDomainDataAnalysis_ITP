		<content>      The land around our school,      
 Sythwood First and Middle, is mostly  
 used for housing but we also have a   
 lot of uncultivated land with various 
 types of trees, gorse and grass.      
 There are several nurseries in the    
 area and we have some allotments too. 
 We also have a farm in the area  down 
 Carthouse Lane. The only bus route in 
 the area comes from Guildford through 
 Horsell and on into Woking. Near our  
 school is a very large housing estate 
 (believed to be the largest in Europe)
 called{Goldsworth Park,}and there are 
 still many houses being built. In the 
 middle is a small shopping centre with
 a large supermarket, general stores,  
 filling station and a half built pub  
 and health centre. Also on this estate
 is a lake which is being developed for
 recreational use.
