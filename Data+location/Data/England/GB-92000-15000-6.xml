		<title>06THE POST ON ST.MARTINS I.O.S</title>
		<content> Living on a remote island means the   
 postal service will be different.For  
 example on some days the local        
 residents collect their mail from the 
 island sub-post office and on others  
 the local post lady delivers it.Also  
 there is only one collection a day    
 from the only postbox on the island.  
 The time of collection is governed    
 by the arrival of the launch,and her  
 schedule is affected by tide          
 conditions.In the summer there are six
 mails in and out per week.This winter 
 we got five mails in and five out     
 which is more than previous winters   
 because of the newly introduced sky   
 bus service to the main island of     
 St.Marys.The local post mistress hand 
 cancels stamps with a hand stamp and  
 then sorts the mail into St.Marys and 
 Penzance bags.These are then taken to 
 the quay by van and put on a launch.  </content>
