		<title>12Brightwell Dairy Farm</title>
		<content>I went to talk to the owner of         
{Brightwell Dairy Farm,} my grandad Mr 
L. Everex. He   told me that he had    
been farming for 69 years and has been 
at Brightwell for 53 years. There are  
80 milking cows which are worth about  
500 pounds each. He has 5 gilts valued 
at 100 pounds each. A sow that is in   
pig is worth about 150 pounds. The     
pigs he breeds are a cross between     
Welsh and Large White, each pig can    
have a maximum of 15 piglets. The sows 
and gilt eat breeding nuts and         
fattening pigs eat pigmeal. On the     
farm there are four tractors which are 
used for many jobs such as carrying    
things and clearing up.
