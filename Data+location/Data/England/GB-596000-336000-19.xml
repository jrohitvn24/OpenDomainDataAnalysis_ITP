		<content>   In a simple village setting, events 
 which may seem old fashioned are still
 important. The village school invites 
 older residents and parents to its    
 Sports Day, Christmas Concert,Leavers 
 Service and the School Sale. These    
 occasions are very popular.           
   The Methodist Church hold a Flower  
 Show and Fete to which most villages  
 will go. The Parish Church has a      
 Festival each July with a concert,    
 exhibition and special service.       
   Hindringham Sports, once a large    
 social occasion on Whit Monday, has   
 been revived though it is now a       
 village occasion and draws only a     
 small crowd.                          
   The Village Players produce a       
 Pantomime each year which is always   
 well attended. The year is punctuated 
 by these events and all sections of   
 the community attend.                 </content>
