		<title>07    Dane Park</title>
		<content>    Dane Park is in a large residential
 area of Margate. It is a recreation   
 park, mostly used by the local people.
 Some children bring their footballs,  
 bikes or skates to the park but their 
 are swings, a slide, and two climbing 
 frames and a large rockery on which   
 children can climb. There are large   
 grassed areas with flower bed, and    
 benches to sit on. Many different     
 kinds of trees grow in Dane Park, but 
 about 40 trees have died, mostly from 
 Dutch Elm disease - these have been   
 replaced by saplings. There are also  
 facilities for adults - you can watch 
 Margate Cricket Club play other clubs 
 most Sundays and bowling by the Dane  
 Park Bowling Club, but the bowling    
 green and two tennis courts can be    
 hired by the general public.
