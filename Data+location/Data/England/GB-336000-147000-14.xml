		<title>14Drainage System around Mark</title>
		<content> The average height above sea level of 
 the Somerset Moors is 17ft. and it can
 be as low as 7ft. in places. The      
{drainage system}has to cope with all  
 the rainfall and the run-off from the 
 surrounding hills. As hightides are   
 sometimes 40ft. it is necessary that  
 the sea walls are kept in good order  
 (breaking occurred in Dec. 1982 with  
 disasterous results in the Burnham and
 Huntspill areas).                     
 The first stage of the system is a    
 network of{ditches}which also serve   
 as fences to fields and are the       
 responsibility of local farmers.This  
 ditch system is linked to a system of 
{rhynes}which are larger and deeper    
 than ditches and are the              
 responsibility in Mark of the{Drainage
{Boards}who levy a drainage rate on all
 householders in the area.Continued on
