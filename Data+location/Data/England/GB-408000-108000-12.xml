		<content> We have lunch in the school hall if   
 the weather is not good. At playtime, 
 after{lunch,}we usually play{football 
 and see if we can get a goal. After   
 playtime we read a few pages of our   
 reading books, then we do{art and     
{craft.}That's when we do sewing,      
 painting and draw pictures. At 3.05   
 p.m. it's home time. I go home with my
 friend Jamie. When we get back, we go 
 to my house, then we go out to play.  
 At 6 o'clock we have{Cubs.}At Cubs we 
 do all sorts of things. We play games 
 and cook things. Then when I get home 
 I watch 'Birdwatch' on TV. Then I play
{cricket}in the garden with my sister  
 who always has to bat first. Then I go
 in to watch 'Dallas' on TV. Before I  
 go to bed, I clean my teeth. Then I   
 choose a book to read in bed. When I  
 get a bit tired of reading, I fall    
 asleep.                               </content>
