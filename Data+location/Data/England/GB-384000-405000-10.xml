		<title>10HOUSING IN MIDDLETON</title>
		<content>     Before assimilation into Rochdale,
 Middleton undertook an extensive      
 building programme. Council estates at
 Hollin, Moorclose, Boarshaw,          
 Cheapside, Rhodes and Middleton       
 Junction were planned as complete     
 units with houses, flats, bungalows,  
 shopping areas, schools, churches etc.
     A Manchester overspill estate was 
 built on Langley where high rise flats
 were constructed despite considerable 
 local opposition. Also on Langley are 
 maisonettes and flats above shopping  
 areas which are now being demolished  
 in favour of more traditional housing.
     Private developments have taken   
 place on fringe areas ;Alkrington     
 being the largest area.Much new       
 building has taken place in Higher    
 Boarshaw whilst much older cottage    
 property still exists in Birch and    
 Bowlee.                               </content>
