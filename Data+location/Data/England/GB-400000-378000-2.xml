		<title>02RELIGION IN WHALEY BRIDGE</title>
		<content>    There are two churches in the      
 parish of Whaley Bridge.The oldest is 
 in  Taxal,the church of St.James.The  
 church was first built in the 14th    
 century but was rebuilt in 1880.The   
 tower is original one.                
           The first rector was called 
  William   Downes he was there in 1287
 .The windows are stained glass        
 cathedral windows with a shell in     
 each,the shell sign of St. James.     
           The vestry was enlarged in  
 1927. The tower has 3 floors. The     
 top floor houses the 6 bells,the      
 middle is empty.The bottom floor is   
 where bell ringing takes place,there  
 are also a few memorial stones.       
 Bell-ringing practice  is on Thursday 
  night.There are normally about       
 eight people in practice,including me.
 The tower captain is called  Herbert  
 Heaton.                               </content>
