		<content>  The oldest part of  {King's School}is
 that which occupies Old House;  this  
 is largely 16th century.  In 1872, New
 House was built as a Headmaster's     
 House and dining hall.  Priory House  
 was purchased in 1942, and in 1954,   
 Lyon House was opened on the site of  
 the original sanitorium.  Blackford   
 House was built in 1960, and in 1984, 
 Wellesley House was acquired for the  
 girls. The Memorial Hall was opened at
 the start of the century and          
 incorporates four classrooms, the     
 Norton Library and the assembly hall. 
 In the 1970's, a new dining hall, and 
 Art and Geography Schools were built, 
 as was a new house for the Headmaster.
 A Sports Hall and Theatre complex were
 opened by the Bishop of London on 20  
 November 1979, and in 1983, a Craft   
 Centre was opened in the old Board    
 School.                               </content>
