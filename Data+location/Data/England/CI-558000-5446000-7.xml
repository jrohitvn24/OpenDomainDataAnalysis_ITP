		<content> St. Brelade's Bay is the main beach   
 in our D block. It is one of          
 the favourite beaches with tourists.  
 There are many hotels along the       
 promenade and numerous shops selling  
 souvenirs. There is a pier which      
 children dive off when they are       
 bathing. There are many water         
 facilities which you can hire out,    
 such as paddling boats, rowing boats  
 and wind surfers. There is a lovely   
 long sandy beach where older people   
 can sit on deck chairs and youngsters 
 can bounce on trampolines. At one end 
 of the beach there are rocks to go    
 climbing on. Behind the beach there is
 the Winston Churchill Memorial Park   
 which is pleasantly set out with      
 waterfalls, fountains, and flower     
 beds. At night the night clubs and    
 discos get into full swing.
