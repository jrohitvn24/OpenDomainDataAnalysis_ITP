 Mr R Griffiths lives at Bury Farm (the
 largest farm in this area).  He moved 
 there in 1959 when it was mainly      
 arable ane stock as it is now.  He    
 told us of the changes that he has    
 seen; a drastic drop in the number of 
 labourers employed and the use of     
 bigger and more modern machinery.     
 Silage has almost taken over from hay,
 but wheat and barley are still the    
 main crops although oilseed rape is   
 slowly catching up.
