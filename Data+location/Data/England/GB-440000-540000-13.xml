		<title>13In Praise Of Peterlee.</title>
		<content>{Peterlee is not a very big town but   
 the council are trying to improve it. 
                                       
 Some people think it is boring in     
 Peterlee but there are{playparks,}lots
 of{grass, a leisure centre}and lots of
 other things too. In Peterlee town    
 centre the council are going to       
 rebuild the town and make it          
 bigger.                               
                                       
 A few bus stops get paint sprayed on  
 and some houses get broken into. The  
 school that I go to is{Acre Rigg      
{Juniors.}I am in the 3rd year, and    
 when I go to the Seniors, I want to go
 to{Shotton Hall Comprehensive}because 
 it is a good school.                  
                                       
 There are lots of other{schools}in    
 Peterlee such as Howletch, Dene House,
 Eden Hall and North Blunts.           </content>
