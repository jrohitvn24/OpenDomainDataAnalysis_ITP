		<title>03FARMING.</title>
		<content> The director of a local arable farm   
 told us that the farm is ten thousand 
 five hundred acres yet employs only 35
 full time workers, plus up to 60      
 seasonal casual workers.The           
 computerised farm office has a manager
 and 7 secretaries.The computer keeps  
 records aids decision making invoicing
 and payments.Winter wheat, barley,    
 oil_seed rape,peas,potatoes and fruit 
 are grown.Some crops are transported  
 to other parts of the country but     
 potatoes are sold to a local merchant 
 Some peas are sold locally for home   
 freezing and the fruit is a pick your 
 own crop. Pests and disease are       
 contolled by spraying from a          
 helecopter and by good husbandry.     
 About membership of the E.E.C.the     
 farmer said"The idea is good basically
 because it tries to give all farmers a
 good living but it's hard to be fair".</content>
