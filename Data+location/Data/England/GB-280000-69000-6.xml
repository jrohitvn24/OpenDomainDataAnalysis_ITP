		<content>  Our school building was originally   
 only the hall which is over 100 years 
 old and is made of granite.In 1976 the
 main part was built.We have three     
 modern open classrooms and a shared   
 practical area with big sinks and     
 several painting tables.We also have a
 quiet room in which we keep all the   
 library books,the T.V. and the video  
 recorder.There is one mobile classroom
 on the field at the moment and we are 
 having another one delivered during   
 the summer holidays.We have a field   
 which we play on during the summer and
 which we use for football during the  
 winter.                               
   We have a small garden in which we  
 grow flowers and vegatables ....      
 and weeds.The hole for a pond has been
 dug and we hope to have some water in 
 it soon.
