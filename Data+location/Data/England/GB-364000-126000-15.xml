		<content> part of their social life,a visit to  
 the cinema was an infrequent event.   
   They had found holiday jobs while   
 still at school easy to get provided  
 transport could be found and you were 
 willing to do anything;casual labour  
 on farms or local pubs.               
   All 3 appreciated their 'luck' in   
 finding jobs after leaving school and 
 none had anytime for the Y.T.S.scheme.
 They felt these were a form of cheap  
 labour and excuses for jobs,providing 
 no real training or proper insight    
 into the world of work.               
   Wider world issues concerned them   
 little.They showed a minimal interest 
 in political,social or economic       
 problems of other countries or        
 peoples.They freely admitted to this  
 apathetic attitude and thought too    
 much consideration of other peoples   
 problems was depressing.              </content>
