		<title>16FARM SHOPS ON LONGTON MOSS</title>
		<content>   On Longton Moss are some{farm shops 
 which sell greengroceries and plants. 
 Customers drive into the farm-yards   
 and buy garden products from the      
 greenhouses or surrounding flower beds
 and seed boxes. Fruit and other       
 produce is kept inside an old farm    
 building and purchased there for the  
 comfort of shoppers, particularly in  
 winter.                               
    {Eggs}are often on sale at the     
 farms,and are also sold wholesale to  
 shops and retailers in the towns.     
 Cracked eggs go for food processing.  
 There are large battery houses in this
 area. Other farms have 'free range'   
 hens. Most people who call at these   
 shops buy their eggs by the tray,     
 which contains two and a half dozen   
 eggs. Prices depend on the size of the
 eggs and are about 5 pence cheaper per
 dozen than the normal shop prices.    </content>
