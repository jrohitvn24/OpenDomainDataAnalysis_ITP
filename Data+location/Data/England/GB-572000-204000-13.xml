 In 1613  a large house called         
 The Vines stood where the Vineyards   
 shopping centre is now.The house was  
 owned then by the{Petre family.}It    
 later passed into the possession of   
 the{Bullen family}who were descendants
 of Anne Boleyn one of{Henry VIII's    
 wives. The{Vineyards Shopping Centre, 
 which replaced the house, serves the  
 local{community}with most of its daily
 needs. There are two banks, a post    
 office, a supermarket and a variety of
 smaller shops.The local library is    
 situated close to the Shopping Centre 
 as is the refurbished{Parish Hall.}A  
 short walk away is the local fire     
 station.
