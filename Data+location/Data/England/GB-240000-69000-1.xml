        Gunnislake and District.       
                                       
       Our  area  consists  of  certain
 geological features  which  include  a
 granite ridge. This ridge links Bodmin
 moor on the West  with Dartmoor on the
 East. It shelters  the  whole  of  the
 Tamar  Valley  from  the  North winds,
 allowing early fruit and flowers to be
 grown.                                
       The ridge runs across  from West
 to  East  and   the area is cut on the
 Eastern   edge  by  the   River  Tamar
 running from North to South.There is a
 main  road running  parallel with  the
 ridge , and a railway linking the area
 with  Plymouth which is  approximately
 20 miles away.                        
       The  area  is  very  fertile and
 most of it is  farmland, in the Parish
 of Calstock.                          </content>
