		<content> Before the 2nd World War  unemployment
 was a lot worse than it is now. It was
 not  the  young  that  were   affected
 but  the  fathers  with   families  to
 keep. Some  wealthy  people  put  some
 money  together  and  gave it  to  the
 unemployed. The  unemployed then built
 the  social centre. It has  been there
 ever since.It is now run by a         
 management committee of 16 members.   
   There are lots of people who use the
 centre  regularly, a theatre  group, a
 rabbit club, there is an  antique fair
 on  once a  month and a ladies  flower
 club.                                 
     There is also bingo, craft fairs a
 keep fit club  and a  karate  club and
 the WI (Woman's institution).         
     It is sometimes used for          
 children's  parties  discos,  concerts
 and  fashion  shows.
