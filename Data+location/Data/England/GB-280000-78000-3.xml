		<content> The snow stays a little longer        
 in Hennock because of the height and  
 because it is exposed to the north    
 easterly winds.The ice stays on       
 hills and makes it hard to travel.    
 Because of the close proximity of     
 Dartmoor the rainfall is quite high.  
  The River Bovey runs through our area
 and eventually having joined  The     
 Teign,meets the sea at Teignmouth.    
  In the past the River Bovey has      
 flooded and caused problems in the    
 Dolphin Square area of Bovey          
 Tracey.This year has seen a new flood 
 alleviation scheme put into operation.
  The soil around about Bovey Tracey is
 mainly Ball Clay,hence the abundance  
 of potteries in the surrounding areas.
