		<title>01Landscape of Croft area</title>
		<content> The area that we have been given to   
 survey is mostly rural.Over two thirds
 of the area is for agricultural       
 use.The nothern part of the area is   
 equally divided for the growing of    
 wheat and rapeseed.The southern part  
 is mostly for cattle pasture and      
 for the growing of silige.Just over   
 one twelth of the area is covered     
 either in disused quarries or the ever
 expanding E.C.C. Croft Quarry.This is 
 the largest synite quarry in          
 Europe.There are two major transport  
 systems crossing the area the main    
 rail link between Birmingham and      
 Leicester.The second is the main      
 motorway M 69 which links Coventry to 
 Leicester.There are two villages in   
 the area,Croft and the larger Stoney  
 Stanton.The latter village has many   
 disused quarries,the most notorious   
 being Stoney cove.                    </content>
