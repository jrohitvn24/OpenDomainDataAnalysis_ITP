 THIS PART OF THE LONDON BOROUGH OF    
 HARROW IS ESSENTIALLY A RESIDENTIAL   
 AREA. POPULATION IS DECLINING WITH    
 SMALLER HOUSEHOLDS BEING THE NORM AND 
 AN INCREASING PROPORTION  OF          
 HOUSEHOLDS OVER PENSIONABLE AGE. THE  
 PREDOMINANT HOUSING TENURE IS         
 OWNER-OCCUPATION. THE TYPE OF HOUSING 
 REFLECTS THE HISTORICAL GROWTH OF THE 
 SUBURB. THE OLDEST DWELLINGS TEND TO  
 BE COTTAGES, TOGETHER WITH LARGER     
 HOUSES ON THE HILL WHICH HAVE SPREAD  
 OUTWARD FROM THE RAIL STATIONS. BY    
 1939 THE "TUDORBETHAN" SEMI WAS       
 EVERYWHERE WITH SOME INTER-WAR        
 TERRACED HOUSING. PRESENT TRENDS      
 INCLUDE THE BUILDING OF LUXURY        
 FLATS AND DETACHED NEO-GEORGIAN HOUSES
 ALL REFLECTING THE PLEASANT BUT       
 EXPENSIVE HARROW ENVIRONMENT.         </content>
