		<content>     The  five  elected {Hunton  Parish
{councillors }have  been kept very busy
 in 1984/5. Their main concern has been
 to improve the area around the village
 Institute at "the Greens."    Whilst a
 separate committee  has  much improved
 the  building's interior, the Manpower
 Services  have been employed to re-lay
 the front verges  and  to construct  a
 car park at the rear. Nearby wasteland
 is gradually  being  converted  into a
 much  needed  recreation field.  Money
 making events have had to  be planned,
 volunteers co-opted.  Dogs fouling the
 pavements, problems with the sewerage,
 worries about unstable trees, building
 applications,thoughtless parking, care
 for Common Land and the  War Memorial,
 all have concerned the councillors.   
   Three of them are also Hunton School
 Governors.Each one performs a valuable
 voluntary service to our community.   </content>
