   This area lies in the south-west of 
 Derbyshire,on the border with         
 Staffordshire from which it is        
 separated by the River Trent.         
   The river runs through the area in a
 northerly direction in a flat valley ,
 with hills rising to a height of about
 92 metres in the east.                
   This is a farming area,with some    
 extractive industry (gravel) on the   
 river washlands.                      
   It is not densely populated,but is  
 in easy reach of such large cities as 
 Derby and Birmingham.                 
   The area contains part of the       
 village of Walton on Trent which is   
 about 5 miles south of Burton on Trent
 and 6 miles north of Lichfield.
