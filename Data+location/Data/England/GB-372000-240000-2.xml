		<title>02Hope End Hotel</title>
		<content>  The poetess Elizabeth Barret Browning
 spent the greater part of her life    
 at the estate of Hope End, an unusual 
 name which means 'the house at the end
 of the valley'.She may well have      
 felt that the estate was aptly        
 named, since her life there was was   
 very unhappy, mainly due to her cruel 
 father, and a serious spinal injury   
 from a riding accident.The house had  
 ample grounds. It lay empty for a long
 time in this century and was rescued  
 from total dereliction. It is now a   
 country hotel. An unusual feature of  
 the outbuildings is that a previous   
 owner had them embellished with       
 Moorish turrets and minarets - this   
 was done at a time when it was in     
 vogue to have exotic architectural    
 features on an estate. They certainly 
 give the outbuildings a distinct      
 Eastern feel.                         </content>
