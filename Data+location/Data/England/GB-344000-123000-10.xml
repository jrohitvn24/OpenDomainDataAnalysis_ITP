		<title>10The Village Hall and Us</title>
		<content> Built in 1972 it is used every day    
 including some Sundays. After the     
 Church and school it is the hub of    
 village life. The Sports pavillion is 
 run separately, but in conjunction    
 with the Hall. Tennis and cricket are 
 keenly supported in the village, and  
 as with the bellringers, social events
 are held at the Hall. The W.I., Old   
 Time dancers and Friendship Club all  
 meet regularly at the Hall, and the   
 Youth Club use the Hall for most      
 months of the year, as do the artists 
 and gardeners. The Hall committee     
 organises a large flower show annually
 and bingo every week. The Playgroup   
 hold their sessions in the Hall, and a
 doctor's surgery is held once a week. 
 Outsiders use the Hall regularly, and 
 it is also used for plays and         
 voting.The Hall abutts the recreation 
 ground and sports areas.              </content>
