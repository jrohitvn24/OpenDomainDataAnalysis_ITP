		<content> AT SCHOOL I PLAY FOOTBALL WITH MY     
 FRIENDS. AT HOME I PLAY FOOTBALL      
 WITH MY BROTHERS OUTSIDE IN THE       
 GARDEN. FOOTBALL IS A GAME WERE TWO   
 TEAMS PLAY AGAINST EACH OTHER. THE    
 TEAM THAT GETS THE MOST GOALS WINS AND
 BOTH TEAMS GET A PRIZE. BUT THE       
 WINNERS GET A GOLD OR SILVER CUP THAT 
 MEANS THE PEOPLE WHO GET THE CUP ARE  
 THE WINNERS. THE PLAYERS PLAY WITH A  
 FOOTBALL AND THEY HAVE TO SCORE PAST  
 THE GOALIE AND IF YOU DO YOU CALL IT A
 GOAL. THE GOAL POSTS ARE WHAT YOU USE 
 SO THE PEOPLE CAN SCORE. THE PLAYERS  
 WEAR FOOTBALL BOOTS FOR PLAYING       
 FOOTBALL. THE GOALKEEPERS WEAR GLOVES 
 TO PROTECT THERE HANDS FROM GETTING   
 HURT. ALL THE TEAMS HAVE NUMBERS ON   
 THERE TEESHIRTS AND THEY HAVE COLOURS 
 SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT TEAM THEY ARE  
 ON. THE REFEREE HAS TO DECIDE IF IT IS
 A PENALTY.         BY GARRY HESLOP.   </content>
