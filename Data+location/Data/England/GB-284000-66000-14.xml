		<title>14TRADITIONS IN ABBOTSKERSWELL</title>
		<content> Beating the Bounds is a once every    
 five years tradition. In the old days 
 they did not have maps but they had   
 stones to mark the boundaries of the  
 parish.The outskirts of Abbotskerswell
 parish is about 11 miles. Adults and  
 children walk around the outskirts of 
 the parish and bump people on the     
 stones lightly to mark the stone so   
 they remember the boundary.           
  On Mayday there is a mini market in  
 the Village Hall, whilst outside the  
 May Queen is crowned and the children 
 from the village school dance round   
 the Maypole and sing.                 
  At one end of the village there is a 
 well, called Ladewell or Lady's Well. 
 The waters from this well are supposed
 to be effective in curing eye         
 diseases.                             
  There is a small Quaker Burial Ground
 just off Wilton Way.                  </content>
