		<title>01Exmoor and Barle Valley</title>
		<content> This aera is predominantly moorland   
 dissected by one large and one small  
 river. It is very sparsely populated, 
 with only 3 remote, stonewalled farms 
 and is served by  less than one mile  
 of public road.                       
 The only industry is subsistance      
 agriculture based on sheep (Exmoor    
 Horn Scotch blackface) and a few      
 cattle. Wild life is abundant with    
 peripatetic herds of indigenous red   
 deer and Exmoor ponies,               
 salmon,trout,and buzzards too.  The   
 landscape is virtualy treeless part   
 from a few beech tree topped stone was
 (known as dykes)and a small plantation
 in the sheltered river valley (or     
 combe) near Cow Castle, an ancient    
 monument.  In high summer, tourists ae
 seen walking in the 'Goyles'7 or steep
 valleys and canoeists appear on the   
 river in flood.                       </content>
