		<title>15Peak Forest Canal,Marple.</title>
		<content>     The Peak Forest Canal runs from   
 two termini,Whaley Bridge and Buxworth
 through Furness Vale, New Mills and   
 Disley to Marple,where it meets the   
 Macclesfield Canal. It descends a     
 flight of 16 locks falling 210 feet   
 and crosses the River Goyt by means of
 a three arch stone aqueduct more than 
 100 feet high.                        
     The canal provides a busy leisure 
 facility and most days,even in winter,
 narrow boats are seen following the   
 Cheshire Ring. There are now narrow   
 boats providing day trips as well as a
 boat that has been converted into a   
 floating restaurant.                  
     After descent of the flight of    
 locks the canal proceeds to Romiley,  
 Hyde and Dukinfield and finally to a  
 junction with the Ashton Canal.
