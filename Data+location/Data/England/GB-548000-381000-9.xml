		<content>{Mr. Reynolds}moved here because he has
 some holiday flats in Sutton on Sea.  
 Before he came he lived in            
 Nottinghamshire for 10 years. He has  
 been in Sutton for 6 weeks.The village
 that{Mr. Reynolds}used to live in     
 didn't have any shops. His hobbies is 
 steam engines and vintage cars.One of 
{Mr. Reynold's}houses was near a river 
 called the Trent and the other was    
 near the Chesterfield Canal. The thing
 he likes about Sutton is the sea. The 
 part he doesn't like is the winter. He
 will live here for most of his life.  
 Where he used to live he had to go 7  
 miles to the shops but here he only   
 has to go out of his front door.
