		<title>08The Village Fete in Lavant 1</title>
		<content> On Saturday the 29th.June,the Lavant  
 Fete took place on the Village Green  
 and in the Village Hall.There were a  
 number of stalls,and the brownies were
 running a jam tart stall,there was    
 also a book stall in the marquee,and  
 the school ran a tombola stall.There  
 was a pocket money stall,where        
 everything was under 50p.I bought     
 three packets of stamps.The stamps    
 were 10p,20p,and 15p.Christine        
 Buckland and Karen Hancock kept on    
 saying _"Could we interest you in a   
 jam tart for 5p each?".Every time they
 came to me I always said _ "No thank  
 you!".The Chichester Recorder Band    
 played in the arena.Not many people   
 stopped to listen.But we didn't mind  
 because they were all buying the      
 different things there.
