		<content>    Here are some of the ways{Scawsby  
 has been spelled and their  date.     
 Scalchebi(1086 - Domesday Book),      
 Scalzbi (1147), Scousby(1226),        
 Scauteby(1316), Scausbye(1620),       
 Scorsby(1771), and{Scawsby}(1870).    
 Most of the names start with 'Sca'.   
    In the book "THE PLACE-NAMES OF THE
 WEST RIDING OF YORKSHIRE" by A.H.SMITH
 (Pt 1,1961) it says they think{Scawsby
 came from{Skalds-by }an Old Norse word
 which means {Skalds farm-stead.}The   
 name Skalds itself means a poet.      
    In 1536 during the Pilgrimage of   
 Grace, Robert Aske and his men camped 
 on{Scawsby Lees}and the army of       
 Charles I camped there in 1641. Lees  
 has also been spelled Leas and Leys   
 and  probably means a clearing or     
 meadow. Henry VIII visited{Scawsby    
{Lees}in 1541, and was told it was one 
 of the richest valleys in Europe.     </content>
