		<content> Evidence of the reason behind ours    
 being labelled the age of technology  
 may be found in most homes. Besides   
 the aforementioned television and     
 video recorders, the majority of      
 families also own a car, sometimes    
 more than one, a refrigerator,        
 freezer, telephone, washing machine   
 and other gadjets such as home        
 computers, microwave ovens and stero  
 units. Many homes are also centrally  
 heated and/or double glazed. Families 
 now have the transport to travel      
 further afield than previosly. Shown  
 by the popularity of forign holidays  
 and numbers visiting places such as   
 Skegness, Blackpool and Alton Towers  
 in a day. Long distance coach travel  
 has also increased to the point where 
 day return trips to London, the Lake  
 District and Wales are becoming       
 popular.                              </content>
