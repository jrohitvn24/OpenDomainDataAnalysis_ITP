		<content> One of the major types of crime at    
 Snelsmore common is theft from parked 
 cars.The other is stolen cars and     
 motor bikes being dumped on the common
 and taken apart for scrap.            
 Snelsmore is patrolled nearly every   
 day and an eye is kept on a number of 
 V.I.P.'s who live off the Wantage Road
 in the area, such as the Lord         
 Lieutenant of Berkshire and affluent  
 business people who are subject to    
 prowlers.                             
 As for country crimes,there are few.  
 In the past 13 years only a few sheep 
 and cows have been rustled and there  
 is no poaching of any of the Mankjack 
 deer. There are no illegal campers    
 allowed to use the common.The local   
 country P.C. broke his leg 8 months   
 ago and because of policing cuts he   
 retired early and the villages are now
 without their P.C.                    </content>
