		<title>02Alresford - Population (1)</title>
		<content>  Over the last 80 years there has     
 been a dramatic rise in Alresford's   
 total population and this figure now  
 stands at 2300. The increase in       
 population was caused by three main   
 factors: firstly ruralisation, which  
 was made possible by greater transport
 facilities, secondly, a somewhat      
 idealised view of village life and    
 finally, the development of the       
 housing estate and new primary school.
 The housing estate catered mainly for 
 the London overspill population,      
 especially those from the East-end who
 brought with them a totally different 
 lifestyle.                            
  Today's population can basically be  
 split into 3 groups. Traditionalists  
 consist mainly of older people who    
 have lived in Alresford for many years
 and these tend to be scattered around 
 the site of the original village.{cont</content>
