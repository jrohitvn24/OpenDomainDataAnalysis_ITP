  A WILMSLOW GARAGE                    
  There are four garages in the area,  
 North Cheshire Garages is one of the  
 larger.  In 1945 the repair shop first
 opened, today about 10 people work    
 there. The workshop opens  at 8.30am. 
 The mechanics repair about 100 cars a 
 week.                                 
  The car showrooms  opened in 1950,   
 at that time they sold very few cars. 
 Now they sell about 14 cars a week,   
 although they only have 8 cars        
 displayed in the showroom.The Vauxhall
 Cavalier is their best selling car    
 this year.The cheapest car is the     
 Vauxhall Astra which costs Â£4949.     </content>
