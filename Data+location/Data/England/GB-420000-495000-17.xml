		<title>17TRAVEL THROUGH CATTERICK</title>
		<content> The parish of Catterick with Tunstall 
 is very popular with visitors. Both   
 villages have beautiful churches,     
 lovingly cared for by faithfull       
 worshipers. Inside the churches are   
 kept in pristine condition and the    
 church yards are always well tended.  
 Catterick is situated just off the A1 
 motorway, tourists heading for        
 Yorkshires upper dales take the road  
 through Catterick and Tunstall. This  
 takes them along by the stream and Low
 Green, named so as Catterick has a    
 High Green too. The stream, known     
 locally as the beck, is a great       
 attraction to picnicers as are the two
 public houses conveniently placed at  
 both ends of the green. Tunstall's    
 public house boasts a quoits team and 
 this attracts a great many spectators 
 on summer evenings.
