		<title>13BAGTHORPE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{  Bagthorpe}is a small village in the 
 county of Nottinghamshire. It is      
 situated in a valley to the south of  
{Selston}and to the east of{Jacksdale. 
   The village has a very rural        
 atmosphere with a small stream,       
 Bagthorpe Brook, running alongside the
 only through road. Along this road    
 there are numerous small copses and   
 farms on both sides.                  
   The village has a primary school,   
 which is quite old. When the shool was
 first opened oil lamps were used to   
 light the classrooms and water was    
 pumped from an outside well.          
   Bagthorpe has 2 public houses:      
 the Shepherd's Rest and the Dixies    
 Arms.                                 
   To the west of the village is the   
 site of Wansley Hall now demolished to
 make way for a modern farmhouse.
