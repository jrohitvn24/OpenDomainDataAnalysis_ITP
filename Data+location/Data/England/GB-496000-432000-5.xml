		<content>  In the village area there are self-  
 employed builders and decorators, but 
 they also work outside the village    
 area.                                 
  There are 5 farms which employ a     
 small number of people regularly plus 
 some casual labour.                   
  There is an antique-restoration      
 business and a quarry which at this   
 moment is not being worked.           
  Because there is so little work      
 actually in the village, most people  
 have to look for work somewhere else  
 and need to travel (or move house).
