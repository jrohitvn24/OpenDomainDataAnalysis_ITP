		<title>04HORSE BREEDING(COLLEGE BARN)</title>
		<content>  College Barn is a horse breeders.    
The main breeds of horse are part      
bred Anglo Arabs.The business has      
only been going for 2 years although   
horses have been bred there for 20     
years.                                 
  The building dates from about 1400.  
All the beams in the house were floated
up the river and all bricks were hand  
made.It is thought that they are the   
oldest bricks in Great Finborough.     
  It is obvious that the house was     
built before fireplaces and windows    
were invented.All the windows have     
shutters and the rafters in the roof   
are black because of fires that were   
made in the middle of rooms.           
  With the house there are 31 acres of 
mostly pasture land.The horses are     
mainly for showing but there are some  
hacks and hunters.
