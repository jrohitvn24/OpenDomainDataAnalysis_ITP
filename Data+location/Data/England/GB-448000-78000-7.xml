		<content> There are very few facilities for     
 leisure and recreation apart from a   
 network of{public footpaths.          
    The footpaths in the Roud area do  
 not look like they are used very      
 often.                                
 They are not all clearly marked at the
 road and are overgrown.The small      
 stiles are unstable and starting to   
 decay. The bridge which crossed a     
 small muddy stream was old and        
 decrepit. One end is falling apart. It
 was hard to continue along the        
 footpath as it was overgrown with     
 stinging nettles and thistles.        
    There are only two footpaths going 
 in and out of Roud. This could be     
 because Roud is not widely known. Roud
 has no facilities for leisure such as 
 a recreation or football ground.
