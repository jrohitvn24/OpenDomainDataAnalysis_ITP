 The trees which are growing are       
 deciduous hardwoods,hornbeam,ash,     
 elder and oak.The undergrowth is      
 mainlly stinging nettles.There is     
 no access at all to the quarry        
 where sand and gravel was quarried    
 but which  has now been abandoned.    
 Our area is very isolated.There are   
 only two cottages but the road going  
 through the area is very busy.One car 
 passed us every minute or so.The area 
 is mostly woodland apart from the     
 abandonded quarry.It is very difficult
 to walk along the road because there  
 is no path.
