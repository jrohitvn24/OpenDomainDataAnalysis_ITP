		<content> Most sheep farmers in the area have on
 average 200 sheep,some share lambs and
 some for breeding.The farmers do not  
 shear the lambs the first year of     
 their lives. Shearing time is in June.
 After shearing the sheep,the wool is  
 sent to the wollen mills at Bradford. 
 Share lambs are sent to market after  
 they have been fattened up,some       
 farmers growing turnips especially for
 fattening up the lambs (The fattened  
 up lambs are sold for Â£40 in the local
 market at Darlington).The breeding    
 lambs are{Swaledale, Border, Leicester
 and {Masham}breeding ewes which are   
 fed on mainly grass, hay, rolled      
 barley and oats.                      
 Most farmers grow their own crops     
 although some do buy them in.
