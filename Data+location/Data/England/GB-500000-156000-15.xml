   The centre can only allow 1450      
 people in because that is what the    
 Centre is licensed for. Every Leisure 
 Centre is governed by the Health and  
 Safety rules which put a limit on     
 spectator accomodation. More people   
 could be allowed in if more fire exits
 were created.                         
   The Deputy Manager, Mr Stan Craven, 
 likes to be able to participate. He   
 does not like to sit behind his desk  
 and dictate to people what they should
 do.  He coaches squash, cicket,       
 badminton, and gymnastics. He pointed 
 out to have a job in this day and age,
 is something, but to have job         
 satisfaction is something which people
 crave for. He has worked there from   
 the very beginning when the Centre was
 just a shell. He has been there almost
 ten years                             </content>
