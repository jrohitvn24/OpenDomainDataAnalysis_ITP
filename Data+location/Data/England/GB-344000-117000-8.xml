		<title>08A Big Farm</title>
		<content>     One farm we went to  had 450      
 acres. They grow wheat, potatoes,     
 kale, fodderbeet and barley. They have
 200 acres of grass for grazing cattle,
 silage making and hay. To plant 25    
 acres of potatoes it takes about 10   
 days. The milk quota affected them    
 them when they joined the EEC         
 because the farmers had to cut down on
 milk. This particular farm sold 10    
 cows for slaughter. They  now have  88
 cows. The big farms have facilities   
 for making silage because they have   
 more modern equipment which is very   
 expensive.
