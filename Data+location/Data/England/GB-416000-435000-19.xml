		<content>   We had a discussion in our class and
 these are the things that scare us.We 
 are afraid of the dark,especially when
 we are in bed at night, nightmares,   
 murderers,graveyards and noises in the
 dark.We are scared that we might see a
 ghost.Creaking boards make our blood  
 run cold.We don't go near haunted     
 houses either.We are scared of wars   
 and bombs,especially nuclear bombs    
 that can destroy the World.           
   Some of us don't like people doing  
 karate.They might fling us to the     
 ground and hurt us.Some animals scare 
 us,like snakes, cheetahs ,dogs ,owls  
 ,rats ,mice ,gorillas ,big fish and   
 also bees and wasps.We also fear fire,
 electric shocks and high places.
