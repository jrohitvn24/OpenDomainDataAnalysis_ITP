		<content> Marshwood, with church and primary    
 school, but no village hall, overlooks
 the north western edge of the         
 Marshwood vale.   This is a lowlying  
 area of fertile clay soil suitable for
 growing grass which supports the      
 predominantly family farms of the     
 district.   The farming is mostly     
 dairying, with some beef &amp; sheep, a   
 small amount of corn and a high area  
 of commercial conifer woods.   The    
 settlements consist of scattered      
 farmhouses and cottages.   In an area 
 of outstanding natural beauty, there  
 are two pubs near Lamberts Castle, and
 at Birdsmoorgate, and one combined sub
 post office/village store/garage at   
 Marshwood.   There is virtually no    
 employment other than in agriculture, 
 apart from seasonal small scale       
 accommodationfor holiday makers.   A  
 private firm runs the only bus, a once</content>
