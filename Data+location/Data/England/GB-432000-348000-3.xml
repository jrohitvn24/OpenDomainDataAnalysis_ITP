		<content>   At{Sycamore Farm}they have a special
 breed of sheep called Dorset Polled   
 and Dorset Long Horns.They are special
 because they mate twice a year. The   
 Hills have lived there for 14years and
 say it is very hard work. The breeding
 season starts in September so that the
 lambs are ready for market at Easter. 
 If the weather is wet it could kill   
 the lambs.Mr.&amp; Mrs.Hill have very good
 quality sheep and they win a lot of   
 shows. When it is the breeding season 
 the ram has a strap with an ink pad on
 his chest.When the ram mounts the ewe,
 you know which ram is responsible.    
     {Nether Nook Farm}has Charollais, 
 Hereford and Guernsey cattle. There is
 an old windmill that used to pump up  
 water for{Nether Nook,Crowtrees}and   
{Palefence.}Crowtrees and Palefence    
 have Friesian cows and Palefence Farm 
 has four horses.                      </content>
