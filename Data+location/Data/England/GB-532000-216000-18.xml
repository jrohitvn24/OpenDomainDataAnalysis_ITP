		<content>Every year thousands of people of all  
ages walk through the lanes and across 
the fields in this area. It is the     
Christian Aid Walk which is a 50km.    
sponsored walk and although different  
routes are always followed, some part  
of the area is covered. This year's    
walk went through the gravel pits to   
Thundridge, back to Wadesmill, up to   
Sacombe Park and out to Stonyhills and 
then on.                               
Where possible the local people act as 
stewards but the walk is organised     
centrally by the Hertford Council of   
Churches. Wherever there is a change of
direction a steward is positioned to   
make sure no-one is lost.              
The charity Christian Aid is an        
organisation which gives help to needy 
communities and individuals in any     
country regardless of race,colour,     
politics or religion.                  </content>
