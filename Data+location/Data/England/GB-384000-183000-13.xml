		<content>  There are 3{shops}selling general    
{groceries,}one also being the village 
{Post Office}and{newsagent},2{butchers,
 one being mainly concerned with       
 wholesale and frozen meat, a{baker}and
 a{clothier}and{florists}shop.         
  Our survey showed that about 20% of  
 shoppers do most of their food        
 shopping in the village. About a third
 of shoppers buy some specific items   
 regularly. Of the 80% who seem to do  
 most of their shopping elsewhere they 
 go equally to Cirencester, Chippenham 
 or Yate.                              
  About a third of the shoppers replied
 that they go to{supermarkets}outside  
 the village because they find that    
 prices are lower and there is greater 
 variety. For some these towns are also
 their places of work.                 
  Meat and bread are the items bought  
 most regularly locally.               </content>
