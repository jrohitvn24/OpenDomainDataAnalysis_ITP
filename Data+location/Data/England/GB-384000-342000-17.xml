		<title>17Travelling in Stoke</title>
		<content>  Stoke has many forms of transport.   
  From Stoke Station we can catch      
trains to Manchester,Birmingham and    
London.The railway line is important   
especially for football supporters     
coming to the Victoria Ground.         
  About seven years ago a new road     
system was built,the A500.This road,   
also called the 'D' road and the       
Queensway goes through the Potteries.At
Hanford there are lots of roads which  
cross each other.From here we can get  
onto the M6.These roads are a great    
advantage to the factories.            
  A long time ago the factories were   
dependent on the canals to transport   
their goods.Today the Trent and Mersey 
Canal which passes through our area is 
used by pleasure craft.                
  The River Trent is very good for     
fishing in!It's a pity that it is a    
little polluted by litter.             </content>
