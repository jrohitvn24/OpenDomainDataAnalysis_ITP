		<title>15TRANSPORT IN EAST HADDON</title>
		<content>In a village served by five buses a day
to Northampton it is obviously         
important to have a car or cars. It is 
a problem for many young people to find
that the last bus leaves Northampton at
5.15p.m. This causes problems with     
regard to working and leisure.         
                                       
There is neither garage or petrol      
facilities available in the village.   
                                       
During the summer months a Sunday      
afternoon special bus visits the       
village on a countryside tour.         
                                       
With just one small shop in the village
shopping is difficult also for the     
elderly as the bus service to Long     
Buckby is equally limited.             
                                       
Nearest rail station- Long Buckby.
