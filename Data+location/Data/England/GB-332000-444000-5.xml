		<title>05EMPLOYMENT IN FLEETWOOD</title>
		<content> Unemployment is steadily rising in    
 Fleetwood. In October 1984, in the    
 Fylde alone, the rate of unemployment 
 was 19.3%. At present (1985) this     
 figure has risen to 21.6%, of which   
 65% are male. However, this does not  
 reflect the true amount of unemployed 
 women as many housewives and mothers  
 do not register.                      
 On leaving school, 13% of children go 
 straight into employment, 70% go on   
{Youth Training Schemes.}30% of those  
 partaking in YTS are actually kept on 
 when their time in training expires.  
 This leaves 17% some of which go to   
 6th form or Technical Colleges and    
 some inevitably are on The Dole.      
 The industries that employ the        
 greatest amount in this area are      
 (a){Lofthouses = 140                  
 (b){ICI        = 1880
