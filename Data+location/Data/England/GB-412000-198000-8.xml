{July 1985.}During the week before the 
 show many aircraft arrived attracting 
 people to take{photographs}especially 
 the arrival of the Blackbird, which   
 landed at Friday lunchtime. The police
 errected a one  way system into the   
 base. On Saturday the{weather}was     
 sunny with blue skies but on Sunday   
 there were low grey clouds, which     
 forced the air display to a lower     
 altitude. The crowd numbered about    
 250,000. Dakotas were there to        
 celebrate their{50 anniversary.}Other 
 notable aircraft were WWII aircraft,
