		<content>           In common with other parts  
 on the Isle of Sheppey this area has  
 suffered a reduction in the bus       
 service and the loss of a{rail        
{service.                              
           The Sheppey Light Railway   
 opened in 1901 providing a service    
 from Queenborough to Leysdown with    
 halts at Brambledown and Eastchurch   
 within this block. It was a single    
 line track giving a restricted service
 until road transport improved         
 resulting in its closure in 1950.     
           Part of the site of the     
 railway can still be seen at Sheppey  
 Light Farm and the wooden shelter from
 Brambledown Halt can now be seen at   
 the cricket club in Eastchurch        
 Village.                              
           An infrequent{bus service   
 and{transport}by car now provide the  
 only means of{travel.                 </content>
