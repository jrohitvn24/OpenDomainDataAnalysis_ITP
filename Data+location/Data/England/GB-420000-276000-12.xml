		<title>12Transport around Balsall (2)</title>
		<content> The station is on the main line       
 between Coventry, Birmingham and      
 London.The station is just outside our
 block.                                
 Then if you want to catch an          
 aeroplane, Birmingham airport (which  
 is now International) is only 15 miles
 away by car. If you catch the train   
 to Birmingham International Station   
 (at the N.E.C) the year old Mag Lev   
 (which is the first successful one    
 in the world) will take you there.    
 Buses go to a majority of places      
 around Balsall Common but take a long 
 time because they go through all the  
 villages.                             
 For the energetic types the lanes     
 through the villages around Balsall   
 Common make lovely walks or bike      
 rides.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
