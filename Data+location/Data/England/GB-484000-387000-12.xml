		<title>12Mr. Lidgett. Part Three.</title>
		<content>  At one time the village had a mobile 
 shop that used to call every week but 
 now they have to shop in Corringham   
 and Gainsborough. Mr. and Mrs. Lidgett
 have a very good postman who brings   
 their pension and runs errands for    
 them.                                 
  They told us that until recently if  
 you were ill and wanted the doctor to 
 call you put a white flag in the hedge
 in front of your house on the day that
 the doctor drove through the village. 
 That was before most people had       
 telephones.                           
  For our final question we asked Mr.  
 Lidgett what he thought was the       
 biggest change he has seen in his     
 lifetime.He told us it was the use of 
 machinery on the farms. When he was a 
 boy all of the work was done by hand  
 and horses. Now they use tractors and 
 machines so less men work in the area.</content>
