		<title>03A NORMAL SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> We start school at 8.55 in the        
 morning.  The register is called and  
 then we go into Assembly. The         
 Headmaster talks about different      
 subjects.  Assembly finishes around   
 9.45.  We then go back to the         
 classroom and start doing Maths. By   
 the time we have finished our Maths.  
 it is Playtime. We usually go on the  
 field if it is sunny, we walk round or
 play cricket or throw balls.  Break   
 finishes at 11.00. We line up and     
 lead back to the classroom.  We then  
 have English or sometimes T.V. for a  
 while. At 12.00 we go home for dinner 
 and school starts again at 1.00. We   
 read a book for 20 minutes and        
 sometimes we have Art or games. In    
 games we play rounders.  At 3.00 we   
 can go home because that is when we   
 finish school.
