  At 7.30 we are woken by a teacher and
 we go downstairs to wash and then have
 breakfast.After breakfast we go into  
 chapel for some prayers,make our beds 
 and then go into classes.We have three
 lessons until break when we go outside
 for half an hour.We then have another 
 three lessons which are followed by   
 lunch.After lunch there is playtime   
 until 2.00 p.m.when we have another   
 two lessons,except for Wednesdays and 
 Saturdays when we all play            
 games,either rugby in the winter or   
 cricket in the summer.Tea is at 4.15  
 and that is followed by an hour's     
 studies.At 6.00 p.m.the day boys can  
 go home or stay to join in some of the
 activities,like photography,computing,
 chess or just play with their         
 friends.Supper is at 7.00 and all the
