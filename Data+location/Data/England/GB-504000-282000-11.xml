		<title>11 Mr. Marriott's Farm</title>
		<content>                                       
 When I went to see Mr.Marriott he said
that he owned the farm because his     
father had owned it before him. He had 
been the only boy in the family and so 
he had to own it. The farm has about   
250 acres of land used for arable      
farming that is growing cereal crops   
( wheat, barley, and a few oats ). The 
farm used to be a dairy farm, producing
milk, butter and cheese for sale in the
village. He still has some sheep which 
gave him 94 lambs this year. Mr.       
Marriott's two sons John and Robert    
help him on the farm and his favourite 
job on the farm is ploughing, even     
though he lost one hand when he was    
young while he was playing with the    
combine.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
