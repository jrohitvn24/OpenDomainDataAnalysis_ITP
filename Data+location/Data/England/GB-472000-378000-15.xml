		<title>15THE POPULATION OF GROVE.</title>
		<content> The current population of Grove       
 appears to be about 90 with less than 
 10 being of school-age.Some of the    
 older inhabitants originally worked on
 the Grove Estate,which included the   
 fine Grove Hall,woods and acres of    
 farmland.The whole estate was sold in 
 1946,when the estate workers were give
 the chance of purchasing their        
 homes.Hithertoo,the familt tradition  
 of all villagers was to work and live 
 on the estate.In turn,the estate woods
 and lands were sold to private farmers
 and the Great Hall demolished.A       
 bungalw,Bodway House,now stands in the
 middle of the former front lawns.Most 
 of the local population are still     
 involved in agriculture and a number  
 commute daily to Retford.Some         
 cherished memories of the Great Hall  
 are retold by visitors, who lived     
 their as displced persons,in 1945.    </content>
