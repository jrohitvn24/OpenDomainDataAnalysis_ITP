		<title>01THE SURVEY AREA</title>
		<content> OUR AREA IS RURAL WITH SMALL,         
 SCATTERED VILLAGES, THE LARGEST BEING 
 GREAT BENTLEY WITH ITS GREEN OF       
 45 ACRES, SAID TO BE THE LARGEST IN   
 THE COUNTRY.  THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES
 OF FRATING, THORRINGTON AND AINGERS   
 GREEN ARE ALL SMALL WITH A POST OFFICE
 CUM GENERAL STORE AS THEIR ONLY SHOP. 
 THE COUNTRYSIDE IS LOW LYING AND      
 VIRTUALLY FLAT, BORDERING ON COASTAL  
 SALT MARSHES TO THE EAST. FARMING IN  
 MANY AND VARIED FORMS IS THE MAINSTAY 
 OF THE AREA, WITH LARGE AREAS OF      
 DECIDUOUS WOODLAND. ONE OF THE MAIN   
 FEATURES OF THE AREA IS THE EARLY     
 NORMAN CHURCH AT GREAT BENTLEY, ADDED 
 TO OVER THE YEARS, BUT RETAINING MANY 
 OF ITS ORIGINAL FEATURES. THE AREA IS 
 PART OF THE TENDRING PENINSULAR,      
 MID-WAY BETWEEN THE EAST COAST RESORTS
 OF CLACTON AND WALTON AND THE HISTORIC
 TOWN OF COLCHESTER.                   </content>
