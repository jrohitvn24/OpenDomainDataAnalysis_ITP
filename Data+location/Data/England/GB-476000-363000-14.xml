		<title>14St.Mary's Church,Carlton.</title>
		<content> An ancient chapel attached to the     
 vicarage of Norwell was taken down in 
 1850 and a new church erected. It was 
 dedicated in 1851.The Church spire is 
 a dominating feature of the flat river
 valley landscape.                     
                  The present vicar    
 lives at Sutton.                      
                 The old school,now    
 closed, is used for village functions.
                 Many social events are
 organised by the church and many joint
 activities take place with Sutton     
 Church.                               
        In the Church is an old Saxon  
 font shaped like a vase.It was found  
 in a garden in Carlton in 1825.       
                                Legend 
 has it that Dick Turpin stopped at the
 blacksmith's shop, not far from the   
 Church,to have his horse shod in      
 reverse to deceive his pursuers.      </content>
