 local crafts, music,food,dancing,etc. 
                                       
 The modern Alnwick fair began in 1969.
  Every year it begins on the last     
 Sunday in June and lasts a week.  It  
 is a reminder of the old traditional  
 fairs and everyone dresses in         
 costumes, dating from 1750 _ 1850.  In
 those days boys and men used to go to 
 the Fairs and shout, "I'm for hire,"  
 and hope someone would give them work.
                                       
 There are lots of stalls set up in the
 Market Place selling roast ox         
 sandwiches, home_made sweets, pottery </content>
