		<content> JARVIS TRUST STAUNTON ON WYE          
 The Jarvis Trust was set up in 1790.  
 The original charity school building  
 was until recently a Youth Hostel and 
 is now run as an Activities Centre    
 with canoeing, pony trekking etc. Part
 of the building is still occupied by  
 Staunton Primary School. There are 12 
 almshouses in 2 blocks of 6 let at a  
 low rent to pensioners from Letton,   
 Staunton on Wye and Bredwardine but if
 there is no applicant for a vacancy   
 from one of these parishes people from
 other areas are taken. A resident     
 handyman looks after paths etc. and   
 helps residents with heavy jobs. The  
 Store house also belongs to the trust 
 who have their boardroom in the ground
 floor and let the remainder.
