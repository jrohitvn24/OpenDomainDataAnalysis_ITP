		<title>02TRAMWAY MUSEUM</title>
		<content> This museum is situated in part of a  
 derelict limestone quarry originally  
 opened by George Stephenson.The       
 tramway is laid on part of the track  
 bed of the old narrow gauge mineral   
 railway.                              
 At the museum there are about 50      
 tramcars from Britain and abroad      
 _horsedrawn,steam and electric.A town 
 street has been reconstructed with the
 tram running through.                 
 In one year up to 106,000 people visit
 the museum, and the most popular tram 
 is the LCC 106.                       
 Once a year a Transport Extravaganza  
 is held when as many as 30,000 people 
 come.This is held at the August Bank  
 Holiday weekend.There are many other  
 special events held there _such as a  
 Teddy Bear's outing.
