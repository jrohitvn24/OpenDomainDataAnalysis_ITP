		<content>      {St Teresa's Garden Fete}takes   
 place very year.  The weather wasn't  
 all that good this year.  We were     
 surprised when a lot of people came.  
 There was a bouncy castle, rifle      
 shoot, darts, golf, bowls, animal     
 croquet and lots of different stalls. 
 Bingo was played inside the nursery.  
 The coconut-shy also was a large      
 attraction,and many coconuts were won.
                                       
      {Jimmy Montgomery,}the famous    
 goalkeeper, came to open the garden   
 fete.  Hot dogs, chips, sweets and    
 drinks were on sale.  Raffles were    
 held with prizes such as a video, a   
 patio set and 2 watches.  Although the
 weather was bad the number of people  
 that came was enormous.  Jazz bands   
 came and played music.  The money was 
 for St Teresa's church and school.{
