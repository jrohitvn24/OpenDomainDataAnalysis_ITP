 Porlock in the past was much more     
 important as a shopping centre for    
 local people and many Exmoor villagers
 and farmers.Many stores remained      
 in the hands of the same family for   
 many generations.100 years ago        
 Porlock had at least 3 Ironmongers who
 supplied the village with every day   
 things, shovels,nails,oil and         
 lamps.There were 2 bakeries,a gents'  
 outfitters,ladies dress shop,chemist, 
 dairy and{Parlour shops}selling       
 chocolate and tobacco.Today there are 
 a surprising number of shops for a    
 village.With the introduction of the  
 motor car people shop in towns so     
 Porlock shops have adapted to the     
 immediate needs of the village and    
 tourists.There are a large number of  
 gift and grocery stores and shops     
 catering for country pursuits.        </content>
