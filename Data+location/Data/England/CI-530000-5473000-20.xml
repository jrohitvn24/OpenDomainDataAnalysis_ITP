		<content>{BUSES}The bus service in this area is 
 good,with 6 buses passing through,all 
 following different routes.The        
 Guernsey bus is white,but several have
 colourful advertisements showing local
 attractions.{CARS}Most people own cars
 and the roads leading to town are     
 fairly busy.The traffic becomes       
 congested during the rush-hour.{      
{BICYCLES}There is one cycle-hire shop 
 near to the St Martins Church Hall.   
 Many tourists like to hire bikes in   
 order to explore the very narrow      
 Guernsey lanes,which cause great      
 difficulties to other modes of        
 transport.Residents also use bicycles,
 but it is a very hilly area and a long
 cycling distance from town.
