		<content>    My Motor-bike. I am ten years old  
 and I have a motor-bike that I use for
 Trails. First I get it out of the     
 shed and then I kick start it, then I 
 put it into gear and rev it up and    
 ride it up to the fields. It feels    
 smooth on the road but when you get   
 onto the field it is very bumpy. When 
 I go over bumps I stand up but if I'm 
 travelling over smooth surfaces I sit 
 down.                                 
    Emily's hobby is stamp collecting, 
 she has about 2 million stamps from   
 many different nations. Emily and her 
 friends really enjoy sorting and      
 learning about the stamps and their   
 country of origin.                    
    Darren, Damian and Stuart collect  
 foreign coins and have collections    
 that include Spanish Peseta, U.S.A.   
 Dollars, French Francs and old        
 Â£.S.d. English coins.                 </content>
