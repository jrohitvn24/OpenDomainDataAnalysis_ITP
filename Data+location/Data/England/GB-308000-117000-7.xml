		<content> There are 21 farms in our area.  The  
 biggest farm is Sampford Farm.  It has
 255 cows, 225 sheep, 3995 pigs and 3  
 horses.  The horses are not cart      
 horses, they are hunters.  The farm   
 has got 385 acres.  The farmer did    
 have more land but he sold 20 acres.  
 He uses some of his land for corn and 
 most of his land for grass for his    
 animals.  He feeds his pigs on pig    
 nuts.  There is one other big farm in 
 our village.  It is called Home Farm. 
 It has 60 cattle and 110 sheep. In the
 winter our survey has shown that most 
 farmers feed their animals hay,       
 silage and cake.  They use their land 
 mainly for grazing and crops.  The    
 main crops are corn, barley and       
 potatoes.  An east-facing slope is    
 best for potatoes because the sun     
 shines on it nearly all day.
