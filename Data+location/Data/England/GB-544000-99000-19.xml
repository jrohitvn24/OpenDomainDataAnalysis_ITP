		<title>19WHAT CONCERNS NEWHAVEN FOLK</title>
		<content> To discover the attitudes of Newhaven 
 people we compiled a questionnaire    
 which was completed by a cross-section
 of the population.                    
 There was concern about local flooding
 from the Ouse and a desire for flood  
 barriers.  The closure of the Valley  
 Hospital also evoked criticism.       
 People were pleased that Fort Newhaven
 had been restored but considered its  
 charges excessive.                    
 Worries about young people seemed     
 widespread: many felt parental        
 discipline was lax and that vandalism 
 was increasing.  People believed that 
 everyone should be able to work even  
 if only part-time.                    
 We found disappointment at the sale of
 the ferry Senlac to the French and a  
 desire for more shops in Newhaven, but
 a general satisfaction with life in   
 the town.                             </content>
