 BUILDINGS_LANDSCAPE_QUARRYING.        
 The community,village,farms and field 
 walls are constructed with local stone
 and give the area a pleasing          
 aspect.The stone used comes from the  
 Bath stone quarries and the layer of  
 surface Cornbrash.Indeed stone is so  
 plentiful there is only one red brick 
 house in the area,all others being    
 stone or stone faced.                 
  The land is undulating &amp; fertile,the 
 underlying clay layer means that wells
 abound.Consequently building took     
 place over a wide area,a long narrow  
 village developed on both sides of the
 Bath road.                            
  Extensive quarrying,since Roman      
 times,has resulted in the northern    
 part of the block being honeycombed by
 passages,many of which are now        
 utilised by the military for storage. </content>
