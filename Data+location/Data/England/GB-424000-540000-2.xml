		<content> There are {two distinct regions       
 within the block:-{city}and{village.} 
 Within the city region housing is a   
 mixture of both period and style. The{
{oldest building}is the medieval Tythe 
 Barn (Hallgarth St). There are also   
 examples of {Tudor}(Owengate),{       
{Georgian}(N. Bailey, Market Place),{  
{Victorian/Edwardian}(The Avenue) and  
 modern housing (Archery Rise). Styles 
 range from terraced (some divided into
 flats), semis and detached.           
    The terrain has influenced the     
 layout of this housing which is       
 mainly built of brick. Slate roofs are
 predominant on old housing while tiles
 are seen on modern homes.             
    Villages have a nucleus of small,  
 terraced miners' homes around which   
 more modern semis, terraces and       
 council houses have been built.
