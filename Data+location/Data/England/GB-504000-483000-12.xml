		<content> Up to 1945 the villages had a balanced
 population of mainly farmworkers and  
 tradesmen. Then many retired people   
 came to live here in new houses built 
 for them. Light industries then came  
 and 4 new estates were built for the  
 young families who moved in. As the   
 estates and families became older the 
 population became more balanced again.
 The population changed little from 519
 in 1821 to 850 in 1941,but rose to    
 3400 by 1981.                         
 The number of children at Cayton      
 Primary School had the same pattern.  
 In 1945 there were 70 children,rising 
 to 326 by 1976 but falling to 230 in  
 1985.                                 
 There is a lack of amenities;only 6   
 shops,no library,doctor,chemist or    
 bank.The green areas have been filled 
 in by houses and heavy lorries use the
 narrow main street.                   </content>
