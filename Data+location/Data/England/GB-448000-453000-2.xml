		<content>   In the North-West corner of this    
 block flows the{River Nidd}a tributary
 of the {River Ose}which flows through 
 the centre of{York.} A smaller        
 tributary of the Ouse also flows      
 across the South-East corner of the   
 block,{The Foss}although this is      
 little more than a stream.            
   The only topological feature of this
 block in an otherwise completely flat 
 landscape is{Wilstrop Wood}a small    
 coppice of deciduous trees which is   
 largely maintained as a widbreak for  
 the nearby{Wilstrop Farm}             
   Other windbreaks can be seen along  
 the A59 road (originally of Roman     
 construction).  These are the         
 distinctive straight rows of poplar   
 trees alongside farm buildings.  These
 trees have given their name to the    
 nearby villages of{Upper}and{Nether   
{Poppleton.}                           </content>
