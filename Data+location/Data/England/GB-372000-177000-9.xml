 The farmhouse was built in 1734 and   
 most of the original buildings are    
 still there, but many have been       
 reroofed and some altered. No boy had 
 been born in the house for over 200   
 years until a son was born to the     
 present owners in 1980.  The farm is a
 dairy farm with 100 dairy cattle and  
 70 replacement cattle(young ones) and 
 30 beef cattle.The beef cattle are    
 sold at Chippenham market.Two men are 
 employed, a herdsman who looks after  
 the cattle and a tractor driver who   
 looks after the feeding of the        
 animals.The working day starts at 7   
 with breakfast at 9. After lunch at 1 
 o'clock the farmer often has office   
 work to do.The family enjoy their     
 life,using the car to go shopping and 
 to church in Wapley and the farmer is 
 sometimes involved in local politics. </content>
