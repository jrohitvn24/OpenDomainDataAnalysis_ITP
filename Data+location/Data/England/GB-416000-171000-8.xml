		<content>{Ogbourne St Andrew}seems to have      
 changed very little in the past few   
 hundred years.The village still lacks 
 many basic public services and        
 amenities and compared with           
 Marlborough has few new buildings.    
 Evidence of the early life of the     
 village is in the beautiful 800 year  
 old{church}which has a well preserved 
 appearance though is being repaired.  
{Houses}are mostly old, though there   
 are a few built more recently         
 including several council houses. Many
 old houses have kept their individual 
 characters with moss and ivy covered  
 walls and thatched roofs.Some of them 
 show signs of restoration, renovation 
 and even modernisation.Other buildings
 include a 400 year old{forge,}a small 
 private{primary school,}a{post office 
 and a local{pub.}On the outskirts     
 stand old barns and farm buildings.   </content>
