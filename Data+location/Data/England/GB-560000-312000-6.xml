		<content> Strawberies are a common summer crop, 
 and many local people (including      
 children !) pick them in season.

 I like picking strawberries becaue I  
 eat them when I get half way down the 
 row. When I get home, I often have    
 strawberry stains on my clothes. My   
 mum makes strawberry wine.            
                                       
 Between the village and Kings Lynn is 
 a large sugar beet factory, and many  
 local farms supply it, though they    
 may have their total crop size        
 regulated by government quota rules.

 Sugar beet is a stinking thing. But   
 when it is a sunny day at harvesting  
 time, it is more stinking than before.
