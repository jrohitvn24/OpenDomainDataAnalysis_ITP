		<content>      The area, consisting of Appley   
 Bridge, Shevington Vale, Shevington   
 Moor and Shevington, can best be      
 described as a group of dormitory     
 villages.  Close to the motorway and  
 the conurbations of Manchester,       
 Preston and Liverpool, many residents 
 travel some distance to work as there 
 is virtually no local employment      
 outside farming and the service       
 industries.                           
      From the early 15th. century the 
 land was owned and administered by the
 Standish family but in 1922, at the   
 death without issue of the head of the
 family, it was sold by auction.  The  
 development of the area for           
 residential purposes began then;  the 
 present population is in excess of    
 12000 and increases steadily.         
 Legacies of the industrial past are   
 being adapted to leisure uses.        </content>
