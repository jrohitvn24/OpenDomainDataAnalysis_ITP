		<title>15TERLING LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> The name Terling comes from the old   
 English -Terlinges- meaning "Tyrhtel's
 People", and has been spelt in many   
 different ways over the years:_       
 Terlinga, Terlinces, Thirlengs,       
 Therlyng, Tharlinges, Therlyng,       
 Terdling, Torling and Tarling. There  
 has been a settlement here since the  
 Iron Age, and we know that the Romans 
 were here, because a hoard of Roman   
 treasure was found in 1824. The Saxons
 were here, and Terling is mentioned in
 the Domesday Book, when the population
 was only 125. The Manor of Terling was
 owned by the Bishop of Norwich, who   
 built his Palace here, and later      
 exchanged it with Henry VIII for the  
 Monastery of St.Benet de Hulme. It was
 a Royal Manor for 2years before it was
 given to Henry's Lord Chancellor,     
 Thomas Audley. There's proof that     
 Henry VIII came here several times.   </content>
