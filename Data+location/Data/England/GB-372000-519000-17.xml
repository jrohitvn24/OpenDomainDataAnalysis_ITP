		<title>17LOCAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content>    Their local concerns are much the  
 same as elsewhere: the cost of living 
 and the weather.  Of particular       
 concern from time to time is the      
 E.E.C. and the effect of regulations  
 upon local farming. The current       
 question of creating the Pennines as  
 a conservation area of great natural  
 beauty could also affect farming and  
 bring about more unwanted regulations.
    Another very current anxiety is the
 proposed closure by British Rail of   
 the Settle-Carlisle Railway, and many 
 local people are involved with the    
 protest movement as this would        
 adversely affect the quality of life  
 here.
