		<title>06BURTON DISTRICT HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>The hospital was finished in 1971 and  
opened in June by Princess Margaret .  
There is accomodation for 250 nurses   
and doctors.There are beds for 400     
patients and the hospital costs 283,000
pounds to run each week.The hospital   
covers the whole of East Staffordshire 
and parts of Derby,Tamworth and        
Leicestershire.There are 80 doctors,   
600 nurses and 700 ancillary staff.When
we went on a tour we saw the X-ray     
rooms and the store where they keep the
medicines. In the Physiotherapy Dept.  
we saw the machines used to treat      
injuries.In winter about 30 people are 
treated per day,in summer more patients
are admitted because more people go    
out. The newest piece of equipment in  
use is a laser used to X-ray pregnant  
women. All the staff and the people    
who were in the hospital seemed happy  
and cheerful.                          </content>
