<title>22St. Edith's Well</title>
<content>

Edith was born in Kemsing in 16/09/0961, the daughter of King Edgar and Lady Wulfrith. She lived most of her short life as a nun in Wilton. When she died in A.D.984 there were reports of miracles. These claims were examined and she was canonised. Her feast is Sept. 16th.  &lt;br /> &lt;br />In the Middle Ages a cult grew in Kemsing and a atatue was erected in the Churchyard. Pilgrims stopped here en route to Canterbury. Her emblems are a wheatsheaf and a goblet of water representing powers of curing diseases of corn, and curative powers of water.  &lt;br /> &lt;br />In the 16th. century the shrine was demolished but the well remains. Every 10 years since 1961, the anniversary of her birth, the St. Edith Festival is held in Kemsing. The 2011 Festival saw the dressing of the Well.   &lt;br /> &lt;br />
