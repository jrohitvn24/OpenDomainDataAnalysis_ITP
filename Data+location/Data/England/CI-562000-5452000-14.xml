		<content>      We visited a man who lived in our
 square. He told us how the land that  
 he owned had changed since he was a   
 little boy. The land, he pointed out  
 had once grown apple trees but now    
 supported crops. The land behind the  
 house used to grow cider apples. He   
 has got a lot of land used for crops. 
 But he does not farm the land himself 
 he has a tenant farmer. We saw some   
 people in his field lifting potatoes. 
 Part of the house is very old the date
 of it is 1776. We went inside the     
 house and up the stairs to the roof.  
 We had a bird's eye view of all the   
 land including his enormous garden.
