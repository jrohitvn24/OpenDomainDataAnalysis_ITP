 Approximately 558 of the businesses   
 are local firms.808 of the companies  
 which replied to the questionnaire    
 have been in the area for over 10     
 years.Over half moved into new        
 premises,the manufacturers going      
 mainly to the new Birches Industrial  
 Estate.Other firms moved into existing
 premises which included a Blacksmith,a
 convent,the Southern Railway Stables  
 and the house of Sir Robert MacAlpine.
 The goods or services provided by all 
 except three companies were for the   
 home market,but the value of the      
 exports which included scientific     
 instruments,computers,and electronic  
 machinery,of those 3 exceptions       
 amounted to billions of pounds.
