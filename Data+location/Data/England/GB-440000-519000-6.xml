		<title>06A TYPICAL DAY.</title>
		<content> In the morning I get up at 7.30 am.   
 I get dressed and go downstairs.      
 I play snooker while mum gets Rachel. 
 At 8 o clock I feed the cat and if she
 gets in the way I only give her half. 
 Rachel won't get up until 8.30.       
 I have my breakfast and then leave the
 house to play on the rope swing which 
 we call a Tarzie. Stephen Wearmouth   
 comes for me at 8.30 and we go in the 
 car to school. School finishes at     
 3.30. and I arrive home at 3.45.      
 Steven Wearmouth calls for me at 4.00 
 and we play up thefield.At 5.30 I have
 my tea and then play toy fights with  
 my dad.Rachel joins in and gets a bit 
 out of control.Then me and dad play   
 snooker for about 5 frames. I watch   
 T.V. for an hour. At 8 pm me and      
 Rachel have fights in my bedroom and  
 throw things out the window.We both   
 get sent to bed.                      </content>
