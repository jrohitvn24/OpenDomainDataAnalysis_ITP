		<content> We live up to our reputation as a     
 nation of gardeners.The weather,so    
 changeable and unpredictable that it  
 forms a constant topic of conversation
 works to our advantage.Vegetables     
 which need water to survive are widely
 grown _ brassicas,potatoes,runner and 
 broad beans.Soft fruits are popular _ 
 strawberries,raspberries,gooseberries 
 and blackcurrants.Apple trees grow in 
 many gardens.We sentimentalise over   
 our flowers.Such plants as dahlias and
 pelargoniums,more suited to a         
 Mediterranean climate are grown under 
 glass or on house window sills to     
 protect them from winter frosts.We    
 take pride in our lawns which, in     
 season,are mown twice a week.Our      
 efforts in 1985 have gained us the    
 award of best kept small village in   
 the county.Our gardens reward us with 
 colour and fruit and vegetables to eat</content>
