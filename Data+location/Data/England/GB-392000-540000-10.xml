      Silage is becoming more popular  
 everywhere, including Rookhope, more  
 and more being made every year. This  
 is due to its consistently high feed  
 value and less dependency on the      
 weather than hay. The silage is stored
 both in specially made pits and also  
 in sealed round bales.                
      As the climate and the steep     
 fields are totally unsuitable, no     
 cereals are grown on any of the farms;
 therefore all dry feed and straw has  
 to be bought in.
