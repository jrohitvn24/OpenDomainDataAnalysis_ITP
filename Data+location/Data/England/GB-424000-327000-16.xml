		<title>16HORTICULTURAL SHOW AWARDS</title>
		<content> There are a number of cups awarded at 
 the show for such things as the most  
 points in each section, the best      
 potato and the best kept allotment in 
 the village. The allotments are off   
 Blacksmiths Lane and provide much     
 needed extra space for those with     
 smaller gardens. An allotment should  
 be of a size to grow enough vegetables
 for a family for a year.              
 At the end of the show, the produce is
 usually donated by the exhibiter to   
 the auction which is held then. As the
 Horticultural Society is non profit   
 making, the majority of the money     
 raised at the auction goes to local   
 charities or causes.
