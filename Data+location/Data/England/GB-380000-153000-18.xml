		<content> The main land use is dairy farming    
 with some wooded areas used for       
 pheasant rearing for profit-making    
 syndicate shoots and private shooting 
 parties. Hedged fields and meadows    
 with some wheat and barley provide the
 scenery, which has been marred by the 
 death of hundreds of elms, killed in  
 the late 1970's by disease. The river 
 Frome with its ruined mill (recorded  
 in Domesday Book 1086), weir and      
 pathways provide fishing, walking and 
 picnicking for people from nearby     
 towns. Cobbled steps, an old pack     
 horse bridge and footpath cross the   
 valley, allowing no route for         
 vehicles. All other lanes are         
 metalled, steep and narrow, affording 
 no passing places. The village is     
 famous for its peace, with no through 
 traffic, and is visited by artists and
 naturalists.                          </content>
