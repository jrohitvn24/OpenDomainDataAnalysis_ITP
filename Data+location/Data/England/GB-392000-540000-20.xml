		<title>20THE FAMILY</title>
		<content>                                       
       Members of the family are very  
 supportive of each other. Each member 
 is responsible for certain duties     
 during the day.                       
       One child observed that he had  
 to do the coal in his house for the   
 fire. His brother had to feed the     
 animals. His mother did the washing   
 and cooked the dinner; she liked to do
 this. His father, however, had to go  
 to work everyday.                     
       The family do many things       
 together. They shop at the weekend;   
 they eat an evening meal together;    
 they help each other with jobs around 
 the house and in the garden.          
       This strength and depth of      
 feeling for one another is an         
 admirable quality.                    
                                       
                                       </content>
