		<title>20POLICING IN TIBBERTON 2</title>
		<content>{COMMUNICATIONS}-W.P.C.Adams has been  
 policing in Tibberton for three years.
 Over that time she has not noticed any
 great changes in the country,except   
 many of the trees have died and two   
 new houses have been built. In the    
 rural areas,like hers,a great emphasis
 is put on making contract with the    
 community. She does this by going to  
 talks and mettings-functions laid on  
 by groups like the Women's            
 Institute-School contacts, such as    
 cycling proficiency tests and by      
 talking to people in the streets.
