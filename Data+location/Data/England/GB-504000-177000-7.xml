		<title>07CREATION OF NATURE RESERVE 1</title>
		<content> During 1984 the London Borough of     
 Hillingdon announced its proposals to 
 sell school land in this Borough for  
 building development.                 
                                       
 A piece of "waste" ground belonging to
 this school (West Drayton Primary) was
 among those to be sold.  Our Parent   
 Teachers Association worked hard to   
 prevent this action taking place and  
 after many petitions and meetings with
 the Council, have saved the land.     
                                       
 We now have one and a quarter acres of
 stinging nettles and brambles to      
 reclaim as a Nature Reserve. So far we
 have cleared one small patch about 6m 
 by 4m and planted flowers to attract  
 butterflies. We have made several     
 paths so that children can walk       
 through and find interesting things to
 watch and draw.                       </content>
