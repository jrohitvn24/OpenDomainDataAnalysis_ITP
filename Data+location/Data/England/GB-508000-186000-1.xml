		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW RUISLIP</title>
		<content>   Hillingdon Borough is in the western
 part of Greater London.Ruislip is     
 found in the north west of Hillingdon 
 It is a very popular place to live    
 because of the good communications    
 with Greater London.Most of the houses
 were built in the 1930's but now new  
 estates are going up.Prices are very  
 high. Most people work in service     
 industries there are few factories in 
 Ruislip. There are several shopping   
 centres :- Ruislip, West Ruislip,     
 Ruislip Manor, Ruislip Gardens and    
 Eastcote.The Ruislip area has a lot of
 greenery.There are 2 farms,a golf     
 course ,a wood,a small Leisure complex
 and several playing fields. The Lido  
 at the northern edge attracts many    
 visitors to our area,for the water    
 sport. We think Ruislip is a pleasant 
 place to live, being near urban       
 amenties but green.                   </content>
