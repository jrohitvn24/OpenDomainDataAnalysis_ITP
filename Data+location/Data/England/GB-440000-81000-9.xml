		<title>09THE POST OFFICE,BRIGHSTONE</title>
		<content>  The Post Office is housed in a       
 delightful thatched building. It has  
 low dark beams and the post_mistress  
 estimated that 5 to 10 people bumped  
 their head every week.                
  Thursday is the busiest day for the  
 post_mistress as this is the day when 
 pensions are paid and there are many  
 pensioners in Brighstone. The invasion
 of the village by visitors also makes 
 her much busier in summer. In the     
 height of the season the post box is  
 full mainly of postcards showing views
 from all over the Island and even some
 places on the mainland as well.       
  The Post Office is a place where     
 locals stop to talk to her and to     
 each other. The post_mistress said    
 that all the different characters made
 her job very interesting.
