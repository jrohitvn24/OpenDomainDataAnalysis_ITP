		<content> Block is dominated by high wastal     
 cliffs in the southern third. At 550  
 ft. there are impression views east   
 and west, and of the coastline and    
 disused alum quarries. Hilly farmland 
 inland from cliffs have no centres of 
 population, just a few farms amd one  
 country road. Popular with tourists   
 for its scenery the area is accessible
 along several footpaths and           
 importantly the Cleveland Way long    
 distance footpath follows the cliffs  
 which are lower in the west. Rocky    
 intertidal area. The residents are    
 seemingly all involved in farming and 
 there are no amenities or tourist     
 facilities other than roads and       
 footpaths (and an interpretive board  
 at the disused quarry) so the area is 
 enjoyed by day trippers and walkers.  
 Part of the area is in the North York 
 Moors National Park.                  </content>
