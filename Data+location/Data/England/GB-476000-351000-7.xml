		<content> I wake up by myself. I get dressed and
 wake up everyone else. That is my     
 brother and three sisters. After my   
 wash, I brush my hair and have        
 breakfast usually cornflakes and      
 coffee, tea or drinking chocolate. My 
 sister and I leave for school at 8.20.
 A.M. Its a long walk to school so we  
 arrive there at 8.55. When the bell   
 goes at 9.00., we line up at the      
 classroom door, then go in and read a 
 book for about 15 minutes. We do      
 language work before play and maths   
 after play. In maths I am on Peak book
 5. At dinner time I go to my granny's 
 and eat crisps or chips. I leave for  
 school at 1.05 p.m. We arrive at      
 school at 1.20. We play till 1.30. We 
 do all sorts of work until hometime.  
 We call at Granny's on our way home   
 for a drink. Back at home I watch T.V.
 then ride my bike or play records.    </content>
