		<content>    The area is wholly agricultural in 
 the north, with mainly arable and     
 dairy farming. Near Morden Heath in   
 the south, most of the land is wooded.
 The land is generally undulating, with
 the highest area in the middle        
 section.                              
    The main{A31}trunk road between    
 Poole and Dorchester passes on an E-W 
 line through the bottom half of the   
 area, and although further south is   
 popular with tourists, this part is   
 rarely visited and has therefore      
 remained therefore largely unspoilt.  
    There are four settlements; Morden 
 and Bloxworth (which together count   
 for 75% of the total population of    
 about 570), and East and West Morden, 
 all of which are situated off the main
 road.
