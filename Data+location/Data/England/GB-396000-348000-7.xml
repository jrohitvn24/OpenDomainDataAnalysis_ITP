		<title>07Seismic survey near Consall</title>
		<content>Horizon Oil Co. conducted a seismic    
survey in the Consall area to search   
for oil. They brought delicate         
electronic instruments and crews of men
into the small village.                
The first person who came was a        
representive obtaining permission for  
the survey. Then the survey crew came  
to find out where to put the listening 
devices and then the geophones. The    
information was transmitted by wire to 
the recording truck. Electronic        
instruments recorded the waves for     
computer analysis. The waves were      
generated by big vehicle mounted       
vibrators. The vibrating took about 30 
seconds at each point.                 
After the survey finished the crew     
tidied up and left. Now the villagers  
just have to wait for them to analyse  
the information and then to tell them  
whether there is oil at Consall.       </content>
