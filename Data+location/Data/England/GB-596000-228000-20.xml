 ALTHOUGH I HAVE COORDINATED THIS      
 PROJECT,THE MAIN BULK OF THE WORK HAS 
 BEEN DONE BY THE FIRST AND SECOND FORM
 PUPILS OF THE SCHOOL.SOME OF THEM HAVE
 THEIR NAMES PRESERVED FOF POSTERITY ON
 THIS DISC,BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF    
 THEM FELT THAT TO PUT ALL THEIR NAMES 
 ON THE PAGE WOULD HAVE TAKEN UP TOO   
 MUCH VALUABLE SPACE.WE HAVE ALL       
 ENJOYED DOING THE WORK THAT HAS       
 RESULTED IN THIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE  
 DOOMSDAY PROJECT,AND WE ONLY HOPE THAT
 FUTURE GENERATIONS FIND IT AS USEFUL  
 AS WE DO THE ORIGINAL DOOMSDAY BOOK.
