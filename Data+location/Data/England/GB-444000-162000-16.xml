		<title>16Shopping in Wash Common</title>
		<content> We visited the shops in our block, a  
 newsagents, a fish and chip shop, a   
 wine merchant's and a supermarket     
 called Budgen's.In 20 minutes 119     
 people went into these shops. We asked
 them five questions about shopping in 
 Wash Common and found that most people
 shopped locally once or twice a week. 
 People also go into Newbury to shop on
 average twice a week. To the question 
 which shop would you like to see here,
 most people wanted a chemist but a boy
 of 15 wanted a record shop. Only two  
 people surveyed bought everything     
 locally. Later this year a chemist    
 shop will be opening in Wash Common   
 which according to our survey should  
 please the local people. We also found
 that the majority of people shopped in
 a town away from Newbury about once a 
 month.                                
                                       </content>
