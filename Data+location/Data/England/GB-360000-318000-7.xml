		<content> There are two churches within the     
 area.   Originally there was also a   
 methodist chapel to the north of      
 Crudgington, but this was bought      
 privately and converted into a fine   
 house.  {Rowton}church was built in   
 medieval times, but greatly changed   
 during the late 19th century.   It is 
 of little note except for a very small
 bell tower.                           
 Waters Upton church is built of the   
 local New Red Sandstone.   It was     
 constructed during the 19th century   
 and designed by G.E. Street.
