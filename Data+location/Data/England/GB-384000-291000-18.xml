		<title>18My Friday, Wombourne</title>
		<content> My mum  wakes me up at 7.40. I get up,
wash, then go downstairs for breakfast.
I  have  Kellogs  Cornflakes  and  milk
then I watch TV.AM. Mum brushes my hair
and I put  on my school uniform.I reach
school at 8.51,go in when the bell goes
then sit down quietly whilst Mrs Murray
calls the register.                    
 We have spelling and tables tests.When
the bell rings we go out to play for 15
minutes. Then  we work  on our projects
until dinner time.I have school dinners
in the dining room.We play on the field
when we are all finished.              
 When the register is taken we have  RE
till  playtime. After playtime we go to
Assembly. When it  finishes  we  have a
story until school finishes at 3.30.   
 On Friday  after  school  I  visit  my
great-grandparents. My dad fetches me.I
have a meal &amp; go to bed at 7.30.I watch
my portable tv until I fall asleep.    </content>
