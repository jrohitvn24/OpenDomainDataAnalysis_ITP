		<title>07NICOLA'S TYPICAL WEEKEND</title>
		<content>We got up Saturday morning quite early.
Dad went outside to work and mum did   
the cleaning while my sister and I     
watched television. At 11.45 I went to 
have my ears pierced, then we went to  
my nanna's. Mum went home and we had   
pork, runner beans, broad beans,       
Yorkshire Pudding, and a sausage,      
followed by yoghurt for dinner. When we
had cleared away, we watched television
all afternoon, until our cousins came  
with the twins. After tea we played    
games until they went home at 8.00 and 
I went to bed at 10.15.                
On Sunday morning I got up and made a  
cup of tea for my grandad. I got       
breakfast when nanna came down. At     
11.00 I went home to mum and dad. We   
had a roast dinner at 1.45 and then    
watched television all afternoon.
