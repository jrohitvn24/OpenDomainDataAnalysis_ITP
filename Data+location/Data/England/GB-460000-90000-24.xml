<title>24Puckpool Park in 2011</title>
<content>

Puckpool Park is still a very popular leisure park with people of all ages, and apart from some updating of its facilities it is much the same as it was in 1986.&lt;br />&lt;br />It still has a children's play area, a cafeteria, tennis courts, and a crazy golf course. The swings and slides etc in the children's play area have been recently updated, as has the crazy golf course.&lt;br />&lt;br />However, the pitch and putt course has gone, the bowling green has gone, and very sadly both the aquarium and the aviary are gone; these are all much missed by those of us who remember them.&lt;br />&lt;br />Entrance is still free, and surprisingly car parking is also free - at the moment - but the ticket machines are still there. &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
