		<content> We saw a lot of{cuckoo spit.}This is  
 really a froth which contains the     
 light green nymph of the frog-hopper. 
 It is called cuckoo spit because it is
 seen in April and May as the cuckoo   
 arrives. We found it on elderberry    
 plants and bracken. We also saw some  
{red and black chequered beetles.}These
 were about 2cm long with 6 legs. There
 were lots of{blue dragonflies}and some
 red and black ones. The blue ones we  
 later discovered are called Hawkers,  
 so named because of their fast 'hawk  
 like' flight. They are large and      
 brightly coloured. The males are known
 to fight to defend their own stretch  
 of water. Among the Hawkers you can   
 find the Aeshna dragonfly. A fully    
 grown Hawker has a wingspan of up to  
 10cm and a length of 7cm. Ours were   
 3cm long with a wingspan of 4cm.
