		<content>   The growth of Felsted has been      
 dominated by the Public School founded
 in 1564 and the population of         
 approximately 2,600 has grown in line 
 with its needs.                       
                                       
   The centre of the village consists  
 of old properties around the church   
 which dates from Norman times.        
                                       
   Some new properties have been built 
 around the outskirts of the village   
 since the 1950's.
