 Southern end of Worsbrough            
 Reservoir,in the valley below         
 Worsbrough Village.It was the site of 
 the home of the{Rockley family}from   
 the time of the Conquest until about  
 1280 whwn it was lost by marriage to  
 the{Everingham}family.The present Hall
 is an Elizabethan building which has  
 been added to at different times in   
 its long life.                        
 Until recently the building was used  
 as a farm and became quite derelict.A 
 few years ago major reconstruction    
 took place and the building was       
 converted into a small number of      
 luxury dwellings.One of the first of  
 the new occupants was{Jackie Charlton

 footballer.Living there at the moment 
 is{Kathy Staff}the actress who plays  
 Nora Batty in Last of The Summer Wine.</content>
