		<title>18Leisure in Nether Kellet</title>
		<content> There are plenty of opportunities for 
{recreation }for people of all ages in 
 Nether Kellet.  When you are very     
 young you can go to playschool. Then, 
 as you grow older, there are cubs,    
 brownies, scouts and Youth clubs.     
 There is a Women's Institute and there
 are whist drives for older residents. 
 Through the year we have bonfire night
 parties, dances and discos. We have a 
 mobile library which comes to our     
 village every week. There are Field   
 Days and a New Year's Eve party. There
 is also a sports day at the school. On
 Shrove Tuesday the Women's Institute  
 organise pancake races on the village 
 green. In the summer there are many   
 teams who enter a rounders league.    
 They play on the village green.
