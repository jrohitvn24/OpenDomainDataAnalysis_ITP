		<title>04Traffic Survey  -  Part2</title>
		<content> The group decided it would be a       
 worthwhile exercise to conduct a      
 smaller traffic survey of movemnet in 
 and out of Tempsford and flow of      
 traffic through Tempsford north and   
 south bound on the A1.The following is
 a table of results taken from         
 11.00a.m. to 12.00 noon Thursday June 
 13th 1985.                            
{A1 South bound traffic.               
{Cars   Lorries  Coach/B   Peds  Bikes.
  452    130      4         3     0    
                                       
{A1 North bound traffic.               
{Cars   Lorries  Coach/B   Peds  Bikes.
  315    121      5         2     4    
 Even though this was not peak traffic 
 times the survey showed just how busy 
 the dual carriage way is.A constant   
 stream of cars and goods vehicles     
 passing up and down the A1 straight   
 through Tempsford.                    </content>
