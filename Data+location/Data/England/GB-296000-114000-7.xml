		<content> The Vicar of Chevithorne lives in a   
 lovley old vicarage designed by       
 Burgess in 1871. Burgess is the man   
 who designed Knightshayes Court. The  
 Vicar is part of the Exe Valley       
 Churches Team Ministry which consists 
 of three Ministers serving fourteen   
 village churches. The Vicar holds     
 services in St.Thomas' Church every   
 week. Some of these services are      
 united with people from the Methodist 
 Chapel in Chevithorne. There are about
 twentysix people who attend church.   
 They come from all around the area.   
 The Vicar's job, as well as organising
 Sunday services, involves meetings and
 visits to people and sometimes a      
 funeral. Some clubs,such as the Young 
 Farmers, hold their meetings at the   
 vicarage.
