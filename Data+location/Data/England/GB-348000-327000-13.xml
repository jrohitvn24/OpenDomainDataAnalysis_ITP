		<title>13Transport and Shop Survey</title>
		<content>  The survey showed most people thought
 public transport in Wem inadequate.   
 Most of them walked into town or used 
 cars and bikes.The train service to   
 Shrewsbury was said to be good, and a 
 third of those asked used it often.   
 But bus services into the town were   
 thought to be poor,infrequent and     
 often quite empty for these reasons.  
 Many buses only run on market day,    
 Thursday. Most people thought the     
 shops and main services were good,    
 although many people said Wem could do
 with a large general store, a good    
 clothes shop and a decent book shop.  
  Shops to be found include;           
 3 fish and chip shops, 2 supermarkets,
 2 fishmongers, 5 butchers, 2 hardware 
 stores, a good bread and confectionary
 shop,4 sweet and paper shops, 1 shoe  
 shop,5 clothes shops, 3 chemists, 4   
 banks, Post Office and 2 fuel outlets.</content>
