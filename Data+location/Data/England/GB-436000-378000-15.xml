		<title>15TUESDAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>      School starts at{9:00}and we     
 first of all go and join class 1 for  
 assembly. We come back to our class   
 for our first lesson which is maths   
 until{10:30}when we have a break until
{10:45}. The next lesson is English    
 which is from a book with passages of 
 writing taken from children's story   
 books. Each passage has questions     
 about it.                             
      I stop for at school for my      
 dinner which costs 45p per meal.      
 At{12:30}we have a long break until   
{1:15}.                                
      After that we have craft when    
 we do things like sewing, macrame,    
 corn dolly making or woodwork. At{2:30
 we have another break until{2:45}after
