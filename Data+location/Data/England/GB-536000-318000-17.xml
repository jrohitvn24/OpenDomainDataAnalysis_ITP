 The tower is about 17 metres high, and
 can be seen for quite a distance as   
 the surrounding countryside is very   
 flat. In 1878 a lot of work was done  
 to the brickwork which was wearing    
 away, and more recently , a great deal
 of money had to be raised to repair   
 the church.                           
  In 1920 the clock was placed in the  
 tower as a memorial to those killed in
 the Great War.                        
  There is a green in front of the     
 church where a garden fete is held    
 every year. Children from the school  
 dance around the Maypole at the fete.
