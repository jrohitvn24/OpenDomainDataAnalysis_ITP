		<title>17Housing in Longdon</title>
		<content>  There are some{88 houses}in the area;
 33 being built post-war by the{Council
 and  some  of these are now {privately
{owned.} There is a  developement of 10
 private  houses.  The {remaining prop-
{erties}in the area are{farm-houses} or
{individually designed}homes.  Some are
 obviously   modernised   and  extended
{cottages.                             
  At  least  14  houses are  of {timber
{construction}and some of the renovated
 cottages could well have interior  oak
 beams.                                
  There  are three  post-war  bungalows
 near  farms  which were  most probably
 built for the old folks  when the next
 generation took over the farm-house.  
  The  grandest  house  is {Birtsmorton
{Court,} parts  of which  date back  to
 the{12th Century.} It has  a moat,  as
 does {Moat House,}near the Church.    
  There is a{Mobile Homes Park.        </content>
