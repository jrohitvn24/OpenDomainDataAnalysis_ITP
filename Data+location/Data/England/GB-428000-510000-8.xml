 marbles and golf.The girls used       
 to play skipping.Some people had a big
 sledge which held 6 people.They would 
 go into the hedge or the river.They   
 sometimes played whip &amp; top and       
 hopscotch they used to swim in the    
 river until 1.30am.The bus was called 
 the Gas Bag because it was like a     
 double decker but was half full of    
 gas.The Grange used to belong to the  
 Spielmans.At night in Hurworth a man  
 used go round with a gas pole and     
 light the lamps.The railway station   
 was at Croft Bank.The train went from 
 Hurworth to Darlington.
