		<title>18Nesley Farm:A Worker's Day.</title>
		<content> I have farmed for fifty-one years.    
 I have been at Nesley Farm for        
 thirty-nine years.The four other      
 workers and I live near the farm.I    
 work a 40 hour week and enjoy my job. 
 My hobbies include gardening,playing  
 skittles and darts and drinking beer! 
 I get up at 6.30 each morning.My day  
 varies:I might be preparing fields,   
 spraying them or building,tiling or   
 plumbing.I usually finish at about    
 4.30.                                 
       For breakfast I eat cereal      
 (usually Cornflakes).I eat cake and   
 meat sandwiches for lunch.I have a    
 cooked meal in the evening.None of my 
 food comes from the farm.I grow my own
 vegetables.I reckon to spend about    
 half of my pay on food.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
