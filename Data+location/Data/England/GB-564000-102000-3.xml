		<title>03Pevensey Castle</title>
		<content> Pevensey castle is one of the most    
 famous landmarks in Britain,and the   
 oldest castle in Sussex.It was built  
 as a fort by the Romans,who named it  
{Anderita}in 340 A.D.to defend the     
 coast from raiding Saxons.Historically
 important as being near the site where
{William of Normandy}landed in 1066,was
 given by William to his half-brother  
{Robert of Mortain,}who made a smaller 
 castle inside the Roman wall with a   
 moat and keep.The castle is made of   
 Roman tiles,sandstone,ironstone and   
 flint.It is the only castle in Britain
 to have been repeatedly used for      
 defence through the ages;Roman and    
 Norman times,during the Armada threat 
 in Elizabethan England and in the 2nd 
 world war when it was used as a       
 command and observation post by allied
 forces until 1949.
