		<title>06Transport in Hannington</title>
		<content> The village is situated 2 miles from  
 the main road (A339) &amp; only has the   
 service of a bus on market days, Wed_ 
 nesdays &amp; Saturdays _ destination     
 Basingstoke &amp; villages in between.    
 Therefore, private transport is essen_
 tial.  Some families have two or more 
 cars but many elderly rely on the bus 
 service.  At the age of 16 youngsters 
 buy 50cc motorbikes as soon as they   
 can afford them, &amp; graduate to a car  
 at the earliest opportunity.  School_ 
 children who attend the designated    
 school in Kingsclere are transported  
 by a private coach _ others have to be
 taken to school by Parents.  The roads
 are single track with 'passing' cut _ 
 outs, &amp; large vehicles have difficulty
 driving through the village.  A small 
 privately run airstrip exists used by 
 enthusiasts of light aircraft.
