 We went along to visit a midwife she  
 told us that she had to go through{4  
{and a half years}training. She has    
 been a midwife for 8 years and she has
 only delivered 3 sets of twins. At the
 moment she delivers mostly girls.She  
 delivers approximately{5 babies in a  
{month.}In a week she approximately    
 travels 100 miles.The oldest patient  
 she has delivered a baby to is 43     
 years old and the youngest is 18 years
 old.                                  
     The average weight of a baby is   
 7lb. She said that the nicest thing   
 about her job is the happy families.  
 She said that her job had changed     
 because there was more specialized    
 equipment and more involvement of     
 fathers and family.
