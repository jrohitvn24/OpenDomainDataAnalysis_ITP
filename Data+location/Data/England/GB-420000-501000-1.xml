		<content> A sleepy,quiet rural corner of North  
 Yorkshire.At first sight little       
 changed for many years.A closer look  
 though shows up one busy village;that 
 of Moulton;and part of another;Skeeby.
 As well as these typical Northern     
 agricultural villages the area is cut 
 almost into two halves by the very    
 busy A-1 trunk road,a four lane dual  
 carriageway along which heavy lorries 
 race endlessly and an important North 
 -South route for businessmen's cars   
 and tourist traffic.Land use is one of
 mixed  farming - grass and arable -   
 with some woodland both deciduous and 
 coniferous.The farmland is still very 
 much a 'patchwork quilt' of fields.It 
 is sparsely populated area containing,
 outside the village, only :-17 farms. 
 In the villages themselves apart from 
 houses are:- 3 churches,1 chapel,     
 1 Public House                        </content>
