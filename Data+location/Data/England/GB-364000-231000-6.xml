		<title>06Houses in Much Marcle</title>
		<content> In Much Marcle there are many         
 different houses.There are lots of    
 cottages and farmhouses which are     
 built of stone or are half timbered.  
 There aren't many modern bungalows but
 there are four or five council houses.
 There are no flats or housing estates.
 In the village there are old houses   
 which people buy and renovate.Opposite
 the school there is a very old house  
 which has been rebuilt.Part of it was 
 Tudor wattle and daub.They have made  
 it into a very nice house to live     
 in.The houses in Much Marcle are      
 expensive to buy.For example a three  
 bedroomed bungalow near school cost   
 eighty-two thousand pounds.It seems a 
 lot of money but it is worth it to    
 come and live in Much Marcle.
