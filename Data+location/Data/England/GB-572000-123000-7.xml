   This is a large 13th century        
 building made of Hastings             
 sandstone,noted for its tall western  
 tower,The present vicar is Rev. John  
 Lambourne.                            
  {Local History}The present church is 
 built on the site of a simple Saxon   
 building and the earliest parts are   
 believed to be dated between 1220 and 
 1250.The monks from the Abbey took    
 charge and added to the building up to
 1350.Little change was made until a   
 major restoration took place in 1861  
 when the interior was completely      
 altered.                              
  A Tithe Map may be seen in the church
 which shows the size of every field   
 and its owner and rent.Some family    
 names are still known in the Parish.
