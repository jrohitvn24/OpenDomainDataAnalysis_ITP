		<title>15THE GRANTHAM CANAL</title>
		<content> Yesterday we went with Mr. Meadows,   
 our teacher, to visit the Grantham    
 Canal. We found it on the map at grid 
 reference 3666. The canal is very old 
 and has got bricks falling from the   
 side. The canal is at least 20 feet   
 deep in places. It has trees growing  
 in it now. Near to where we visited   
 there was a bridge over the canal. The
 bridge had a number 11 on it. We had  
 to go through a gate. It was very     
 stiff.                                
 We had to be careful with our feet;   
 you could tell that cows had been     
 there! We could see three farms. On   
 our walk we passed Manns bridge and   
 Hollygate Farm. We had to walk round  
 the back of the pit tip. The tip is   
 very big and it is interesting to     
 think that all the stuff came from    
 hundreds of feet underground.
