		<title>01BOREHAMWOOD-AN INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> Borehamwood was a small village until 
 the 1950s when there was a rapid      
 expansion to provide housing for      
 families relocated from North London. 
 Separate estates, each with their own 
 parade of shops, were built; and a    
 main shopping street, Shenley Road,   
 also developed around the parish      
 church. Employment centred on the film
 and television studios, as well as    
 industrial estates whose occupants    
 include Sellotape, GEC and the        
 cold-storage depot of Christian       
 Salvesen. The area also includes      
 specialist concerns such as the       
 Blood Products Laboratory and the     
 Fire Research Station. In the centre  
 of the town are the Civic Offices,    
 the Civic Hall entertainments centre, 
 swimming pool, library, college of    
 further education, and fire, police   
 and ambulance stations.               </content>
