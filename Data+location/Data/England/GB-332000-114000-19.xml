		<title>19THE ILMINSTER BY-PASS</title>
		<content>   The final go-ahead for the long     
 awaited by-pass came in 1985.         
 Ilminster is one of the last great    
 bottlenecks on the A303 and the       
 by-pass will help ease the flow of    
 traffic especially in the holiday     
 season when it sometimes seems like   
 the whole of Britain is trying to get 
 to the west country. There are some   
 worries about the effects the by-pass 
 will have on trade in Ilminster, and  
 some of the local farmers are unhappy 
 at having their farms cut in two by   
 the road. Work is due to start in     
 1986.                                 
   It will be interesting to see       
 whether the new road unifies the      
 villages of Horton and Broadway more, 
 as at the moment they are divided by  
 the existing A303. there will also be 
 an increase in the value of property  
 in the area once the traffic goes.    </content>
