		<title>07Interview- school leaver</title>
		<content>   We chose to interview Blair because 
 she was at Shipbourne School and she  
 now has an interesting job.After      
 leaving school she went to work at    
 Fairlawn Home Farm where there are    
 2200 acres of arable,beef and sheep.  
 She does many jobs including mucking  
 out the cows,littering up,lambing and 
 harvesting.In the summer Blair works  
 very long hours and in the winter     
 works from 8.00am till 5.00pm.        
 Blair has had some adventures at      
 work.Once when she was in a field     
 a fire started and she had to         
 beat it down and call for help on     
 her C.B. Another time she was in her  
 tractor and sliding down a hill so she
 had to change gear quickly.Blair      
 leaves Fairlawn in September and goes 
 to the Harper Adams Agricultural      
 College where she will train to be an 
 agricultural engineer.    James.      </content>
