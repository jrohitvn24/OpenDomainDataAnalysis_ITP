		<content> THE FARM MANAGER AT{NAFFERTON}TOLD ME 
 HOW THE {EEC MILK QUOTA SYSTEM}HAD    
 AFFECTED HIS FARM.IN{1984}HE HAD TO   
 REDUCE MILK PRODUCTION BY{9%}BASED ON 
 THE PREVIOUS YEARS FIGURES.THE CUTBACK
 IN 1985 WAS A FURTHER 1%.IN ECONOMIC  
 TERMS THIS REPRESENTS A DROP IN INCOME
 FROM {Â£144,000 TO Â£122,000}BECAUSE    
 MILK PRODUCTION IS BELOW QUOTA OVER   
 THE WHOLE OF BRITAIN HE IS ALLOWED TO 
 INCREASE HIS HERD SLIGHTLY,BUT WILL   
 NEVER REGAIN PRE 1984 LEVELS.         
{FUTURE TRENDS }THE MANAGER SEES 10% OF
 PRESENT FARM LAND BEING TAKEN OUT OF  
 USE,MAINLY FROM SMALL LESS EFFICIENT  
 FARMS.MANY PEOPLE WILL BE FORCED OUT  
 OF AGRICULTURE,WITH INCREASING UN_    
 EMPLOYMENT IN RURAL AREAS.ONLY THE    
 MOST INTENSIVE UNITS WILL SURVIVE,AND 
 THESE WILL HAVE TO BECOME MORE        
 EFFICIENT AND MECHANISED.
