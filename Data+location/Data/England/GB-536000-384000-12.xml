 It is very  interesting to watch      
 television. Every night there is the  
 News and on Saturday there is a sports
 programme called Grandstand. There is 
 a very good programme called Roland   
 Live. Kevin the Gerbil,Glennis the    
 Guinea-pig, Errol the Hamster and a   
 little rat called Little Reggie are   
 puppets in this show. On Tuesdays and 
 Thursdays there is a serial called    
 Emmerdale Farm. In this programme     
 there is a little boy called Sam. He  
 is only 2 years old and is a very good
 actor for his age. There is also a    
 very good programme called Animals in 
 Action. The man who introduces the    
 programme talks about different       
 animals and insects.Our  school likes 
 watching Blue Peter and cartoons like 
 Dog T'Artagnan,Dungeons and Dragons   
 and Inspector Gadget.                 </content>
