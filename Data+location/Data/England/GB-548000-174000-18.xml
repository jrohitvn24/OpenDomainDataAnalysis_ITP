		<title>18THE FIRE STATION</title>
		<content> Bexleyheath Fire Station (Code E28),  
 has 33 fire officers and one          
 appliance.  The men are divided into  
 four watches, Red,Blue, Green, and    
 White, plus one Divisional Officer.   
 Each crew consists of a station       
 officer, a leading fireman and 6      
 firemen.  On each 999 call ther must  
 be at least 5 crewmen.  The Divisional
 Officer does not travel on the        
 fire-engine but has his own vehicle.  
 The most common call-out is to small  
 domestic fires, mainly chip pans.  The
 work is sad at times, but usually it  
 is enjoyable.
