		<content> In {Hanbury }thirty years ago very few
 people could afford holidays. Those   
 who could spent a week at a seaside   
 resort in England hardly anyone went  
 abroad.                               
 Sundays were occupied by going to     
 church although most of the farming   
 community had to work as usual.       
 Most village people travelled to work 
 on bicycles or used the bus if they   
 wanted to go further afield to        
 Droitwich or Bromsgrove to visit the  
 cinema. Today there is no regular bus 
 service in the village and most people
 use private cars.                     
 There used to be one shop in the      
 village which also served as the Post 
 Office together with a telephone      
 exchange.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
