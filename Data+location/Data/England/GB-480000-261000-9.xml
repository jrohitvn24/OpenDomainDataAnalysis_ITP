		<content>Ecton is just off the A4500 the old    
main road from Wellingborough to       
Northampton. To the south of the       
village is the new A45, a dual         
carriageway that joins to the M1.      
A group of children went up to the     
footbridge near Ecton Brook on Friday  
17th May 1985 at 9.30a.m. They had a   
checklist each and ticked off the      
number and types of vehicles they saw  
in a 15 minute period. They saw:       
95 cars, 27 vans, 19 lorries, 2 buses, 
5 coaches, 1 motor bike, 1 bicycle,    
1 tractor, 2 pick-up trucks, 4 taxis,  
1 landrover, 1 police car and 1        
ambulance.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
