		<title>03WEALDEN IRON, BEDGEBURY AREA</title>
		<content>   Mining and smelting of Wealden iron 
 ore began before the Roman conquest,  
 reached its peak in Tudor times and   
 ended by about 1800.  Archaeological  
 features, names and chalybeate springs
 remind us of the former industry.     
   The most abundant deposits were     
 found in the Wadhurst Clay near its   
 junction with the Tunbridge Wells or  
 Ashdown Sand, generally the latter.   
   Numerous small ponds are minepits   
 from which iron was extracted and     
 taken to nearby furnaces for smelting.
   Larger lakes were formed to provide 
 power for furnace bellows or smelting 
 hammers, usually known as Furnace or  
 Hammer Pond, a Pond Bay being the dam.
   Known furnaces here are at Frith    
 Farm and Furnace Farm, the latter less
 than a mile from the Bedgebury Forge, 
 at Forge Farm to the northwest, which 
 was operative till about 1600.        </content>
