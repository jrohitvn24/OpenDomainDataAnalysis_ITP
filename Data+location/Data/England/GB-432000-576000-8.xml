		<content> as we got onboard had to make tracks  
 for the rigging while the rest fell   
 back into the boats. Rats, I never    
 sawso many in my life and never hope  
 to again. Great, hungry, lanky, lean  
 looking rats many of them with teir   
 tails chewed off. Swarmed up from     
 below in never ending thousands,      
 squeaking and squirming one over      
 another in a manner sickening to      
 behold particulary to those of us up  
 in the rigging. At last we cut off    
 some loose ropes knotted them into    
 convenient lengths and so we descended
 armed and attacked the rodents        
 eventually succeeding into beating a  
 passage to our boat." What happened to
 the rats is not recorded but the wreck
 was salvaged in parts by the Tyneside 
 Shipping Company.
