		<title>13Balloon Wood Flats.</title>

 The Â£3m Balloon Wood access flat      
 development was part of a national    
 response to the problems of slum-     
 clearance and re-housing.Its          
 philosophical justification was       
 'terraced streets in the sky',but its 
 actual function was closer to mass    
 resettlement on the cheap.Within a    
 month,the first tenants were          
 complaining of walls with mould and   
 over the next 15 years damp became an 
 increasing problem as the concrete    
 sweated from within and corroded the  
 steel reinforcing from                
 outside.Inevitably,as the monolithic  
 ediface deteriorated,it became highly 
 unattractive to potential tenants and 
 developed into a dumping ground for   
 people whose problems were compounded 
 by such an environment.In 1984        
 permission was granted for demolition.</content>
