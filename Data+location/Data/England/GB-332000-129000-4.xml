		<title>04Basket Making</title>
		<content> Withies are the thin twigs which grow 
 on willow trees.They grow beside a    
 ditch because they need a lot of      
 water.Some withies are grown in       
 special beds near the basket works so 
 they are handy for the basket         
 makers.On the road from Burrowbridge  
 to Lyng there is a place where they   
 make baskets.They grow the withies on 
 the land behind the shop.There were   
 three different colours.The dark      
 brown ones have been steamed with the 
 bark still on.The light brown ones    
 have been boiled for a short time with
 the bark still on.The white ones have 
 had the bark taken off while they are 
 still fresh.We watched the men making 
 the baskets.They sat on the floor and 
 worked so fast that I could hardly see
 what they were doing.In the shop and  
 outside we saw the baskets, cots and  
 stools they had made.                 </content>
