 Stanley common is a linear settlement 
 based on the A609. This road goes from
 Belper to Ilkeston. We recall seeing  
 around 100 fields in all. These fields
 are mostly rough grazing land and     
 derelict fields. In Stanley Common    
 there is 3-4 acres of deciduous       
 woodland. This is called Morleyhayes  
 Wood. There is a little recreation    
 ground. There are 5 farms which are   
 used for different purposes and there 
 is also a dismantled railway. Some of 
 the farms had animals and others had  
 crops like barley and wheat. Hayes    
 Farm is being refurbished as a place  
 for parties to eat out.               
 In the village there is a small sports
 centre which has enough facilities for
 the village. There is a fair sized    
 shop which was built as a Co-op but   
 was then changed to Cresswells.       </content>
