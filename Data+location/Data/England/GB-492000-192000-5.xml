		<content>   Many children between the ages      
 of six and eighteen enjoy attending   
 groups or{clubs}in the                
 nineteen_eighties.These include       
 established organisations like the    
 Boys'Brigade and the Scouting Movement
 as well as local youth groups.        
  Being a member of the Boys'Brigade   
 or the Scouts involves attending      
 weekly meetings where one can work for
 awards and badges.These include       
 sporting activities,hobbies and       
 interests as well as first aid,fire   
 prevention and other safety measures. 
 The atmosphere is pleasant and        
 friendly and enjoyed by everyone.     
  In the area studied there were Scout 
 Troops,Cub Packs,Girl Guides,Brownies 
 and Boys'Brigade units;as well as     
 local Church and Youth groups.These   
 may become a thing of the past as more
 and more people prefer to watch T.V.  </content>
