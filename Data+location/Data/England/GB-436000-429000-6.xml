		<content>    I attended the old stone-built     
 parochial school which was erected in 
 1865.It was used until 1964 and is now
 a Youth Club.The only houses in sight,
 when I started school in 1915 were the
 old rectory,the Almshouses in Church  
 Lane and the schoolhouse,adjacent to  
 the school, which was the home of the 
 headmaster,Mr.J.Watson, and his wife. 
 We had a variety of playground games  
 including hopscotch, whip and top,    
 shuttlecock and battledore and        
 pingball. There was a maypole in the  
 girls' playground.                    
    At that time it was a Church of    
 England school.The rector used to give
 us religious instruction and an       
 inspector came regularly. The lady of 
 the manor would come occasionally to  
 visit us and award prizes. If we met  
 her outside school we were expected to
 curtsey.                              </content>
