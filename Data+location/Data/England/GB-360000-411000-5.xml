		<content>    The original Domesday Book recorded
 how the ordinary people in each       
 village made their food from the land.
 Someone in 1,000 years from now might 
 be interested in the diet of a typical
 class of primary schoolchildren.      
                                       
  Breakfast: cereal, toast, fruit-juice
 or tea                                
  Lunch: school meal; packed lunch     
  Evening meal: beefburgers the most   
 popular; favourite vegetable chipped  
 poatoes                               
  Supper: sandwiches were favourite,   
 followed by cereals, then biscuits,   
 all washed down by milk or fruit      
 juices.                               
                                       
    Incidentally, the favourite pets of
 our class were 1:cat  2:dog  3:fish.  
                                       
    How typical are we for 1985?       </content>
