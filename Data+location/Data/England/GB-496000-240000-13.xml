		<content> In the north-west between Marston     
 Moretaine and Cranfield is an area of 
 old woodland known as Marston         
 Thrift.This mixed deciduous wood was  
 coppiced for Hazel up to the beginning
 of the 2nd World War.After the war    
 about 40% was cleared and replanted   
 with conifers.The remaining 60% was   
 unattended except for shooting        
 rights.About 10 years ago the Beds and
 Hunts Wildlife Trust acquired the     
 rights from the Forestry              
 Commission,who themselves leased the  
 wood,to manage the area for Nature    
 Conservation.This area is also a Site 
 of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).
 South of Marston Thrift is the ditch  
 around the northern and western edge  
 of the clay pit.This is an area of    
 specialized plant and animal life-a   
 mass of Coltsfoot in the Spring,and is
 to be safeguarded from restoration.   </content>
