		<content> Primary education for children living 
 in our area is available at {The      
{Clinton School,Merton }. Children can 
 start attending this school at the    
 begining of the term during which they
 become 5.                             
                                       
      Before 1962 when this school was 
 built on land provided by {Lord       
{Clinton},children attended four       
 schools situated in each of the four  
 contributory parishes.                
                                       
      When the children of the four    
 parishes reach secondary school age   
 they are offered a place at Great     
 Torrington School.Some choose to      
 attend private schools.
