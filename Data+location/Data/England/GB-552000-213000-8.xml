		<title>08Hatfield Heath Festival (2)</title>
		<content> Although the actual festival lasts for
 two weeks, the main events are held   
 during a weekend in the middle of     
 June.  As well as all the sideshows   
 there are many arena events such as   
 demonstrations in Karate and B.M.X.   
 riding.  The local children are       
 involved in a pageant or fancy dress  
 competition and they also give a      
 display of country dancing.  There is 
 an exhibition of paintings by local   
 artists in the village hall.  There   
 are various contests such as horse    
 shoe throwing, tug of war and custard 
 pie throwing.  This year on the Sunday
 there was a 5 mile Fun Run which      
 attracted about 150 competitors.      
 During the fortnight other events     
 include a children's film show, an    
 inter-village quiz, plays in the      
 village hall, a B.M.X. evening and    
 many, many more.                      </content>
