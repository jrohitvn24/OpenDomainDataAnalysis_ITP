		<title>05A HISTORY OF SEND SCHOOLS</title>
		<content> Send Primary School opened in         
 September 1854. It was built on Send  
 sand pits which belonged to the Earl  
 of Clandon. The school accomodated 100
 children and included a school house  
 for the teachers. Improvements were   
 made to the building over the next    
 118 years. In 1939 St.Bede's C.of E.  
 Secondary School opened in Bush Lane. 
 In 1972 Send Primary School moved     
 its premises from Church Lane to the  
 Bush Lane site and re-opened as       
 St.Bedes C.of E. Primary School with  
 about 313 pupils. Secondary school    
 children were taken by bus to the     
 Guildford comprehensive school whilst 
 the closure of Ripley Primary School  
 brought children from Ripley, Okham,  
 Wisley and Clandon to St. Bede's.     
 Subsequently St Bede's became a Middle
 School with pupils from 8-12 years. In
 1985 the school had 232 pupils.       </content>
