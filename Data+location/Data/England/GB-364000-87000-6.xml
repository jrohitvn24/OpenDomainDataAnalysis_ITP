		<title>06  Martinstown Today.</title>
		<content>   Martinstown has changed considerably
 in the life time of Mary Clarke(nee   
 Bowring).It has seen a significant    
 development of housing at its eastern 
 end and there has even been an oil    
 test drilling.                        
   In the last years the school has    
 closed and village children now travel
 by bus to Dorchester Schools.Despite  
 this Martinstown is increasingly      
 popular as a residential area being   
 attractively rural and within easy    
 reach of Dorchester.                  
   Employment patterns have changed;   
 most of the inhabitants do not work in
 the village and few are involved in   
 its traditional occupation-farming.   
 Those social activities associated    
 with agricutural and once enjoyed by  
 the village have faded away-barn      
 dances,hay-making picnics and the     
 November fair.                        </content>
