		<content>  I get up at about seven thirty in the
 morning and get dressed.Next I go down
 to get washed and have my breakfast   
 then I pack my violin and catch the   
 bus.                                  
  I get to school about eight thirty.  
 Our first subject on a Friday is maths
 then we have play. After play we have 
 language then play. Our next subject  
 is art and craft. At two thirty we    
 have our last play then games. I go to
 cricket.We usually play a match. Then 
 it is time to catch the bus home .    
  When I get home I feed my rabbits and
 my mouse. I feed my rabbits on grass  
 and pellets and my mouse on hamster   
 food. After I've fed my pets I ride my
 bike and watch the television until   
 five thirty when I go horse riding.   
  I get back at about seven thirty and 
 then I ride my bike and watch  the    
 television and practise my violin.    </content>
