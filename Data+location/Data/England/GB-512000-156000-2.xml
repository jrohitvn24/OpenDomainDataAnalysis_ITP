		<content>    The{Yehudi Menuhin School}is a     
 music school. Yehudi Menuhin formed   
 the school 21 years ago. The building 
 is old and is set in beautiful        
 grounds. You need talent to be        
 accepted at the school. Each day is   
 divided between lessons and music.    
 There are 45 children in the school   
 who are arranged in groups of 4 to 7  
 for teaching. Ages range from 8 to 18.
 The children rise at 6.30am and go to 
 bed at 9.30pm.                        
   {The drive}is lined with very tall  
 trees which prevent much light getting
 through. The grounds are impressive.  
 There is a small clump of woodland in 
 the middle of a beautiful lawn. There 
 are tennis courts, a swimming pool and
 a football pitch.                     
    All the children agree that it is  
 great fun being at the school.
