		<content> I get up about 8am and get washed,    
 dressed and go downstairs for         
 breakfast. I often go out riding on   
 my bike, it is very peaceful in       
 Eastoft. The land around is used to   
 grow cereal crops and sugar beet. Many
 of the farms are very big but there   
 are still a few small ones. When we   
 reach 11 we have to go school in      
 Crowle and travel each day by bus. The
 population of the village is about 300
 which makes it a small place. We have 
 a Post Office, a church, a Village    
 Hall and a primary school. There used 
 to be fish in some of the streams     
 around here but many have died,       
 probably as a result of pollution.
