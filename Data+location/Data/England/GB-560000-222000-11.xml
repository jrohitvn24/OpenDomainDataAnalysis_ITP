		<title>11INDUSTRY AND EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content>   Most light industry in Dunmow is    
 situated on the industrial estates.We 
 found a small company called Triton   
 Electronics,employing seven people    
 operating from Bigod's Hall.We        
 interviewed Mr Tapp who is a partner  
 in the busisness and he discovered    
 that the Elizabethan building had been
 used in the 1900's by Lady Warwick to 
 house a progressive school.In the 1950
 Kelvin Hughes produced radar equipment
 there.Triton make laboratory test     
 equipment for water and chemical      
 companies and they export 60% of their
 products.There is a small forge near  
 the church producing ornamental iron  
 work.Many residents have expressed    
 concern that shops are being replaced 
 by hairdressers,building socities and 
 restaurants.There are many new job    
 opportunities in Dunmow,but most of   
 our paents work outside the town.     </content>
