		<content>   The beautiful church spire of KING'S
 SUTTON can be seen for miles as this  
 large village stands on rising ground 
 surrounded by good agricultural land. 
 This prosperous farming area has both 
 arable and grass fields.   The village
 is in Northamptonshire, just over the 
 border from Oxfordshire.              
    The River Cherwell, the Oxford     
 Canal and the railway all pass close  
 by the west of the village as they run
 south from Banbury to Oxford.   There 
 is a small station at King's Sutton.  
 The new motorway should soon be built 
 along this valley too.                
    The manor house and the old part of
 the village are near the church.   Now
 there is Council housing and plenty of
 new private housing too.
