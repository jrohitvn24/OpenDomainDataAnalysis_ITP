		<title>12FIXBY JUNIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> We went to Fixby School.  We went to  
 the Head and while we were waiting we 
 looked at the pictures and we were    
 very impressed with the details and   
 the painting.  Then we saw a bird.  It
 was stuffed and it was called a Black 
 Backed Gull.  Then the head came up   
 and we went to a class and we asked   
 some questions about the school.  The 
 school was actually started by Mrs    
 Smith and it was built in 1977.  In   
 the school they had two computers and 
 they both had disk drives.  One was   
 for the Infants and the other was for 
 the Junior school.  They had 30 disks.
 In the school there are 207 pupils.   
 The Head said that they liked         
 projects.                             
 The boys liked playing soccer and     
 netball.  The girls like playing      
 different games.  There was a big     
 field and it was about 7 acres long.  </content>
