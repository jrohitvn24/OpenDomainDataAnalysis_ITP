		<content>  We open again at 6pm and we start    
 getting busy at about 7pm.  If it is  
 nice weather we have lots of boats in.
 The most number of boats we have ever 
 had in is eight.  I  usually go       
 upstairs at 7.30 and watch the        
 television.                           
  Sometimes when it is nice weather    
 people walk from Evesham across the   
 fields and will stand on the other    
 side of the river and shout for the   
 ferry.  My dad or I will go over on   
 the ferry and pick them up.  We have  
 to pull on a chain to make the ferry  
 move .  We charge them about 10p a    
 person.  During the flood about three 
 weeks ago the ferry chain snapped.
