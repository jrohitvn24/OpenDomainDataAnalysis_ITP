 We carried out a survey of all the    
 10 &amp; 11 year old children in Kingmoor 
 Junior School to find out what their  
 mums &amp; dads did for a living. Most of 
 the working mums in the Lowry HiII    
 area worked in shops. Most dads were  
 managers of one sort or another. One  
 mum worked as a lolly pop lady. (She  
 helps children across the road before 
 and after school). Another mum was a  
 creche assistant. One dad was a       
 medical doctor &amp; another worked in a  
 bank.All dads were employed.About     
 three quarters of the mums had jobs.  
 Nearly all working mums &amp; dads worked 
 in Carlisle city.
