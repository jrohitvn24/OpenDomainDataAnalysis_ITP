		<content> Our section of map is a rural area    
 comprising many small village         
 communities, as well as part of       
 Falmouth, the nearest town.We are very
 conscious of the fact that we are     
 never far from the sea, Falmouth      
 having grown up from the port         
 site,near the docks.It follows that   
 the two most important sources of     
 employment are the docks and the      
 tourist industry. Inland,farming is a 
 major occupation.There is very little 
 other industry in the area.           
 Although new housing is being built in
 Budock to accomodate young families,  
 we have a very high proportion of     
 retired people in the area, and       
 unemployment is generally high,       
 especially when the tourist season    
 finishes.
