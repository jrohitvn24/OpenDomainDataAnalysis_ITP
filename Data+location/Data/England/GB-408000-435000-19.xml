		<title>19WILDEN GALA</title>
		<content> Wilsden Gala is an annual event, held 
 in July. There is a procession with   
 floats which starts the gala by       
 wending its way through the village,  
 finishing up at the park by the       
 Village Hall. A Gala Queen and her    
 attendants open the gala. All sorts of
 activities then begin. This year,     
 1985, there were two contempary dance 
 displays. One was{'DISCO'}type        
 dancing, and the other was{'BREAK'}   
 dancing. Break dancing is currently   
 the new rage. It is a very gymnastic  
 form of spins, turns, flips and dives 
 to special 'Break Dance' music. Stalls
 included plants, books, second-hand   
 items, pop and crisps and ice cream.  
 There were other entertainments for   
 the many gala goers, such as bouncing 
 on a large inflatable castle, smashing
 crockery, and a coconut shy. In the   
 evening there was a dance for adults. </content>
