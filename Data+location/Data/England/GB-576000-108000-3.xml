		<title>03The Coastline</title>
		<content> The coast runs roughly E-W.The beach  
 is mainly pebbles,protected at many   
 points by groynes.There is some       
 concrete sea wall along the coast to  
 protect the promenade at St.Leonard's 
 and other potential inundation points.
 Sandstone cliffs at Glyne Gap are     
 still being undercut.Notices warn the 
 public not to walk near the cliff     
 edge.Longshore drift still carries    
 pebbles eastwards.A few small diesel- 
 engined fishing boats at W.St.Leonards
 still work the inshore waters.Swimming
 sailing and sailboarding take place,  
 and many beach huts which are just    
 above high water mark are often       
 damaged or smashed by stormy seas.    
 Rubbish is strewn on the beach near   
 these,washed up by the sea or         
 deposited from landward.Plastic       
 wrappings and containers abound,as do 
 metal drink cans.                     </content>
