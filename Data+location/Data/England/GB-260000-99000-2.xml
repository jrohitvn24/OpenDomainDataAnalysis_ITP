		<title>02Farming in the Sampford area</title>
		<content> Farms are mainly seeded pasture for   
 grazing.Dairy herds are diminishing   
 because of the milk quotas.Sheep and  
 beef are increasing,there is some     
 arable farming.There is rough grazing 
 on Chapple moor which is boggy in     
 places.                               
  The future of farming is intricately 
 linked to changes in the Common Market
 Agricultural policy.Dairying will     
 probably decline further,with         
 increases in sheep,beef and arable.   
 Environmental concern may lead to     
 better management of woods and the    
 retention of permanent pasture on the 
 wetter land.Changes in the occupancy  
 of a number of farms could lead to    
 pressure on these areas against the   
 general trend.A move towards world    
 commodity price levels would produce  
 pressure on farm incomes and a need to
 combine farms or supplementing income.</content>
