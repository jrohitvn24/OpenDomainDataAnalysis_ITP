		<title>03Fashion in 1985</title>
		<content> Fashion varies depending on the season
 Some clothes are designed for         
 spring/summer,others for autumn/winter
 Summer clothes are often made of      
 cotton,a very light weight material.  
 Winter clothes are made from heavier  
 materials such as wool and polyester. 
 The style in 1985 tends to be very    
 loose:baggy trousers,jackets,jumpers  
 and shirts.The rules of fashion are   
 very strange.Ladies may wear skirts,  
 blouses,trousers and shirts.Men may   
 wear trousers,shirts and ties.Both men
 and women wear jackets.This means some
 clothes are unisex.Some people have to
 wear a uniform.This is a set of       
 clothes that people have to wear      
 because of their job.Nurses,doctors,  
 transport staff,postmen and soldiers  
 and many other people have to wear    
 uniform.Some schools have a compulsory
 uniform for the children.             </content>
