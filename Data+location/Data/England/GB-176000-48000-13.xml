		<title>13CALLESTICK, NEAR TRURO.</title>
		<content> This neat village of 20 old cottages &amp;
 farmhouses among trees on the east-   
 facing slope of a small valley, was   
 formerly a mining village: the miners 
 walked to work at the lead mine whose 
 engine-house still stands a mile from 
 the village.  It is a non-development 
 area with only 4 recent houses,       
 restricted to agricultural housing.   
 Many of the village residents are     
 middle-class people with work in      
 nearby towns.Whereas once people would
 congregate to chat in the village     
 street, this is not done now. There is
 no village shop;a weekly shopping trip
 to Truro is standard. The local pub is
 the "Plume of Feathers" at Penhallow 1
 mile away. Callestick Methodist Chapel
 was demolished 10 years ago due to    
 falling congregations;  the Methodist 
 cemetery is now cared for by members  
 of Perranporth Methodist Church.      </content>
