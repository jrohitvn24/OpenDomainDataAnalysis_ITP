		<title>04Health Care In Thorpe Hesley</title>
		<content> In the last ten years there has been a
 big change in this area in the way    
 that health care is approached the    
 people who work for Rotherham Health  
 Authority are now interested in       
 preventative medicine. We have a new  
 doctor's surgery which has just been  
 built in the village which is the     
 centre for this Primary Care          
 Team. There is no flouride in the     
 water supply which means that gum     
 disease and tooth decay have worse    
 effects in our area. Some farmers and 
 those involved in health care have    
 been concerned by the pollution from  
 the coking plant. Chest diseases and  
 illnesses caused by stress are worse  
 in our area.
