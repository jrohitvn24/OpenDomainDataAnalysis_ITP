		<title>09LEE MOOR-CHINA CLAY-TRANSP.</title>
		<content> There are no major waterways or       
 railway lines in the area.This means  
 that anything which has to be carried,
 has to go by road.Fortunately,the     
 china clay can be gravity fed         
 (suspended in water)to Marsh Mills for
 drying,through a pipe.However,the     
 better quality clay (S.P.S.)is taken  
 back up to Lee Moor by road to be     
 further refined,and then carried again
 to where it is needed by road.Carrying
 the clay by road is only viable for   
 the better quality clays.The cost of  
 carrying the waste sand by road is not
 viable in economic terms,which is why 
 the waste tips have developed.Another 
 problem with the sand is that it tends
 to be 'sharp' sand,which requires more
 cement than other types of sand to    
 make concrete.Other uses for this sand
 are being sought but at the moment no 
 other use is considered to be viable. </content>
