		<title>09VICTORIAN ATHERSTONE</title>
		<content>The improvement in communications due  
to the development of the canal and    
railway was linked to a growth in      
population and the development of      
industry in Atherstone.By 1891 the pop.
was 4991.In 1851 there were 4 hat      
manufacturers,the two main ones being  
Joseph Willday and James Vero.The town 
itself was limited to large private    
houses,shops and Â£yards' where most of 
the pop. lived-accommodation was over- 
crowded(10 to a house),the workhouse   
provided alternative shelter(sited at  
the present day Regal Cinema).Although 
conditions were hard, life had its     
compensations-Atherstone has always had
more than its fair share of pubs and   
many of the yards had their own ale    
house facing the street eg Hand and    
Bottle, Swan and Neck and the Angel.   
The sign "The Angel Yard" can still be 
seen by The Angel pub in Church Street.</content>
