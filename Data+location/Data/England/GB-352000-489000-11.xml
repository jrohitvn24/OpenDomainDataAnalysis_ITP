		<title>11KENDAL MATERNITY HOSPITAL.</title>
		<content>{ The Maternity Hospital}has stood for 
 ninety-five years. Cotton merchants   
 owned the building until 1892 when    
 they handed it over to the health     
 service and it was converted from a   
 house into a hospital.                
  There are ten wards and forty-five   
 staff. The{operating theatre}and      
{labour ward}date from 1955 and the    
 lift and fire escape from 1958.       
 1965 saw the addition of the{ante_    
{natal clinic nursery and milk kitchen.
 while in 1967 new kitchens and staff  
 dining facilities were added. In 1984 
 three{new delivery rooms}were opened, 
 as well as an{admissions room and duty
{station.}Today, a programme of repair 
 is in constant operation.             
  Two{babies}are born each day, most   
 being allowed home during their first 
 week. March is the busiest month for  
 the hospital staff.                   </content>
