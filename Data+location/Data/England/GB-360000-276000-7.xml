  In the area which we are doing about 
 the shops are combined with the other 
 things Post Offices, garage and       
 restaurant.                           
 Most people travel out of the area to 
 buy their groceries at bigger shopping
 places like Ludlow Cleobury Mortimer  
 or Kidderminster.                     
 People who use the local shops place  
 orders. There is a mobile van which   
 sells most things that people need and
 calls at the houses twice a week.     
 There is also a butcher which delivers
 meat and poultry.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
