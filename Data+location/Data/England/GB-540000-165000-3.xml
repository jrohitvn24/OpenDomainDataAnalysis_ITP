		<title>03NORMAN PARK</title>
		<content>    Norman Park is very large and has  
 many sports pitches for games like    
 football, cricket, hockey and         
 korfball. It has six changing         
 pavilions. The children's playground  
 is quite exciting and has slides,     
 seesaws, swings, a roundabout and even
 a helicopter and tank.                
    There is a floodlit athletics      
 stadium and two large carparks. We    
 found out that the name of the park   
 came from Montague Norman who owned   
 the nearby estate.  He must have been 
 very important because he was the head
 of the Bank of England and signed all 
 the pound notes.                      
    They have many events in Norman    
 Park such as circuses, fairs, motor   
 shows, sports tournaments, horse      
 trials and dog shows.  It's a very    
 busy place. The River Ravensbourne    
 runs through a tunnel across the park.</content>
