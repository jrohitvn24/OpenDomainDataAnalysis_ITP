		<title>09Talbot's End Pond</title>
		<content> The purpose of the pond in former     
 times was to provide drinking water   
 for horses and to allow farm carts    
 with wooden wheels and iron rims to   
 drive through to prevent the shrinking
 and falling apart of the wheels . For 
 there reasons the pond was regularly  
 maintained, and mud removed. With     
 mains water and cattle troughs,this   
 regular maintenance has stopped. A    
 couple of years ago the pond was      
 drained by some villagers cleared     
 out, and repaired. A survey of the    
 pond this year has revealed, that the 
 following creatures live there :      
 newts, caddis fly, mussels, water     
 boatman, broad-bodied libella, Water  
 crowfoot, damsel fly, Watersnail,     
 toad and moorhen.
