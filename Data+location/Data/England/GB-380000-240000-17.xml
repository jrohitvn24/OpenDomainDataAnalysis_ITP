		<content> There is little in the form of        
 organised leisure for the young       
 children of Hanley Swan.Generally they
 play in each other's homes or gardens.
 However on Friday evening there is an 
 exodus of small boys as they go to    
 Cub Scouts.The pack meets at Hanley   
 Castle High School and is well        
 supported.At their meetings they play 
 games,learn knots,go tracking and work
 for merit badges.Akela takes them on  
 joint ventures with other cub packs in
 the area.Recently with the Scouts they
 put on a concert and had such fun     
 dressing up. At the concert the Scout 
 Master was presented with a Medal for 
 long service in the Movement.The Scout
 pack is a Sea Scout troup and quite   
 popular with the older boys.In        
 addition to the usual Scout activities
 they go canoeing and sailing.
