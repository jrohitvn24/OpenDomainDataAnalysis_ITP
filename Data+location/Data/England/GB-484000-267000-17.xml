		<title>17THE WAENDEL WALK</title>
		<content> Since it began in{1979}this event has 
 become an international one with      
 people from all parts of the world    
 participating. There are three        
 distances that those taking part can  
 tackle:-{9 km. 18 km. or 27 km.}The   
 event is non-competetive and takes    
 place over a weekend in the early part
 of June. The event is named after a   
 tribal leader of the area, Waendel,   
 who, it is thought, gave his name to  
 Wellingborough. All the walks start   
 and end at Weavers Sports Centre and  
 cover as much of the Borough of       
 Wellingborough as possible. The       
 emphasis is on participation and      
 enjoyment for whoever takes part. Many
 who take part, for example scout      
 groups, camp for the weekend on the   
 centre's outdoor areas.
