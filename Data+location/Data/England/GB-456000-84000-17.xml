		<content> The area is divided into distinct     
 areas; downland, woodland, water      
 meadows and roughland.  The plant and 
 animal life in each area has a        
 character of its own.                 
{1.DOWNLAND}Here on the chalk downland 
 the grass is short and coarse.  Few   
 trees grow except stunted hawthorn,   
 used mainly for hedging.  In the      
 spring cowslips can be seen but these 
 are not as common as they were.  In   
 the spring cowslips can be seen but   
 these are not as common as they were. 
 A decade ago the downs were a mass of 
 yellow in April and May, now however, 
 they are quite difficult to see.  In  
 the summer the sharp eyed walker can  
 occasionally spot a bee orchid, but   
 these are now very few and far        
 between.
