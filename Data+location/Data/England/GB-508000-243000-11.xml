		<title>11Attitudes at the School</title>
		<content> As may be seen the aim of the school  
 is to ensure that all children have   
 access to a wide curriculum and great 
 emphasis is placed on the children    
 using and experiencing their own      
 environment. One project, the         
 development by pupils of a school     
 garden, has given them the opportunity
 to watch the changing seasons. The    
 resulting pride in their acheivement  
 has in turn created a caring attitude 
 towards their environment which it is 
 hoped will extend beyond the school   
 community. The caring attitude        
 prevalent in this school is typified  
 by one lady employed to work in the   
 kitchen, but who is often to be found 
 helping the children with their       
 garden.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
