		<title>15THINGS MADE IN AMPNEY CRUCIS</title>
		<content>  Many women have learned an art or    
 craft by joining the W.I. It is       
 possible to see lace making, basketry,
 macrame, embroidery, lampshades and   
 cushions at W.I shows in the Village  
 Hall. There is fine needlework,       
 tapestry work and dressmaking done all
 over the area. A magnificent patchwork
 quilt was made by many local adults   
 and children 4 years ago. It was      
 raffled for church funds. The church  
 kneelers were worked by parishioners. 
 Sewing parties meet occasionally to   
 make things at church bazaars. Some   
 beautiful brightly knitted jumpers    
 were made for Ethiopia by W.I.        
 members. A professional potter,       
 furniture maker, garden furniture     
 designer and maker, and a design      
 artist live in the area.
