 On the 9th of July the{Duke of Kent   
 came to the{Westcroft Estate}to       
 celebrate it's{50th anniversary.}He   
 came at 3.20pm. He was talking to Mrs 
 May then he made a speech to the      
 people and a lady called June played  
 'God Save The Queen' on her keyboard. 
 Then he planted a new tree and a girl 
 presented a rose to him on a silver   
 tray. He asked her "Were you the girl 
 who presented me with the rose last   
 time?". Then the newspaper reporter   
 took a photograph of them.            
   The Duke of Kent walked into the    
 Kent Hall and he had a drink. Children
 were not allowed into the hall but    
 outside they had drink and food.
