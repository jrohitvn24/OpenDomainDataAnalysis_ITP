		<content> St. Giles church Pitchcott was        
 recently made redundant. The village  
 does field a very succesful amateur   
 football team although many of the    
 players are not villagers. The        
 recreation ground is the envy of many 
 larger villages. The county was famous
 for its productive grassland. As a    
 result of EEC food policy, much of    
 this is now ploughed up for unwanted  
 cereals. The village however remains a
 peaceful and very pleasant one in     
 which to live.
