		<title>10TOURISM IN NETHERBURY</title>
		<content> Spring here sees not only the return  
 of the daffodils, but also the        
 re-appearance of "B &amp; B" signs on     
 cottage walls and at farm gates.      
 Overnight accommodation is available  
 in a hotel, several pubs, guest houses
 and private homes.  Good home cooked  
 food is available in restaurants and  
 pubs.  There are several public       
 footpaths for pleasant walks with good
 views and antique shops for tourists  
 to browse in.  Our most important     
 tourist attraction is Parnham House   
 with its furniture workshop and       
 woodworking school, art and craft     
 exhibitions, outdoor theatrical       
 productions, lectures and musical     
 evenings.
