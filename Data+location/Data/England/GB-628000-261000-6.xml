		<content>Thomas Mills died a rich man in 1703   
and was buried in his own garden. The  
tomb is still visible from Station     
Road. In his will he left money for 8  
almshouses to be built; they stand at  
the side of the Tomb House. He also    
left money for a grammar school to be  
built. In 1978 a comprehensive school  
called Thomas Mills High School was    
opened and the old grammar school was  
sold for $60,000. A large plot of land 
beside the almshouses has been sold and
101 houses are being built there. The  
trust also owns other pieces of farming
land in the area. There is $450,000 in 
the trust now and this money is        
invested. It is used to maintain, heat,
light and insure the almshouses. At the
moment they are being extensively      
modernised. Trust money is also granted
to Thomas Mills High School. Interview 
with Mr.M.Ashwell, Chairman of Trust.  </content>
