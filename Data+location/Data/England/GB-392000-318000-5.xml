		<content>  At Barnfields Primary School, out of 
a population of 386 children we found  
that Andrew and Claire are the most    
popular christian names.  The second   
most popular are Mark and Nicola.      
Andrew and Claire were chosen mainly   
because parents just liked them but in 
one case Andrew was chosen as it was in
the Bible and Claire because the mother
liked the song 'Claire' by Gilbert     
O'Sullivan and she had the same initial
as her brother.                        
  Of the children born in 1979-80 the  
most popular names are Lisa, Andrew,   
Jonathan and Mark.  In 1973-74 the most
popular again are Claire and Andrew.
