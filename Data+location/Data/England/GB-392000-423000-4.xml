		<content>   Todmorden's industrial heritage is  
 based on the fortunes of the cotton   
 industry.At the height of its         
 prosperity there were 34 cotton mills,
 but today only four remain in         
 business.As a result the population   
 has fallen from 24,500 to 14,500.     
   Many former mills have changed their
 use or have been demolished.A large   
 variety of firms have moved into some 
 mills,e.g.electrical contracters, tent
 makers, plastic manufactures.None of  
 these footloose industries employ many
 people.The largest employer in        
 Todmorden is Warman International, who
 make industrial pumps and employ about
 350 people.                           
   Slide 'C' shows Robin Wood Mill,    
 which was once Todmordens largest     
 employer.It now stands derelict, and  
 largely disused, as a monument to     
 'King Cotton'.                        </content>
