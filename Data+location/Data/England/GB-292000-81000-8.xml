		<content>   {Talking to a school governor       
{ }Most children in our class did not  
 know what a School Governor did. Since
 every school in the country has       
 govenors we invited one of ours into  
 the class. We had some information he 
 told us that a school govenor has lots
 of jobs.                              
  One is apointing staff and help the  
 headmaster like all other governors.  
 He is the eyes and ears around the    
 village,and if hears any complaints or
 comments he tells the headmaster.He   
 also discuses the schools future      
 and past with the headmaster. He      
 enjoys just popping into see the      
 children and staff.
