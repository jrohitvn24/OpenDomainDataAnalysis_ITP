		<title>11A Day in my life in 1985.</title>
		<content> At{7.45 am.}my mum comes in my bedroom
 and wakes me up for school. I don't   
 get up straight away - I lie in bed   
 reading my favourite book. At{8.00 am}
 I get up and go into the bathroom. I  
 brush my teeth and wash my face. In 5 
 minutes I'm dressed and go downstairs 
 for my breakfast, with my brother     
 Adrian. At{8.20}Dawn comes to call for
 me and we set off for school. When I  
 got home from school my mum had       
 fishcakes and chips ready for my tea. 
 They were very nice. Dawn came round  
 at{4.50}and we played golf till{6.30.}
 Then we went to Dawn's house and her  
 Dad asked me if I wanted to go roller 
 skating at Adwick with them. But my   
 mum said I couldn't as I would be     
 going to Sheffield on Saturday and I  
 had to go dancing. My mum took me, and
 my dad picked me up at{8.45pm.}Then I 
 watched T.V. I went to bed at{9.30pm. </content>
