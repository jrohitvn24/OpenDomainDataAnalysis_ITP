Home Meadows Nursery is situated on the
south facing slopes of the River Fynn, 
which is a tributary of the River      
Deben.                                 
 The Nursery has eight long greenhouses
in which grow different varieties of   
flowers. The greenhouses are heated in 
winter by a coal furnace, which is     
automatically controlled by a computer,
to keep the temperature at 50 degrees  
Celsius. The insulation is thermal     
bubble polythene against the glass.    
 They have 30,000 Chrysanthemums plants
all at different stages of growth.     
Autumn is the best time of year to see 
them when they are ready for sale.     
 An unusual flower grown here is the   
Icelandic Poppy in hues of white,orange
and yellow. It has won many prizes at  
the Chelsea Flower Show.
