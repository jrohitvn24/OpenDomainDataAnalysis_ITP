		<content> Records are not readily available but 
 the earliest date that the school is  
 mentioned in local historical text is 
 1829.This puts the school at 156 years
 old.The children used to remain at the
 school in Brailsford until they       
 reached 14 years of age but now they  
 transfer to the Comprehensive School  
 in Ashbourne,six miles away.At its    
 peak the schoolhad about 120 pupils   
 but in recent years the number of     
 children on roll has been around      
 72.The children come from two         
 villages,Brailsford and Shirley,as    
 well as outlying farms.The school is  
 organised into three classes to cover 
 the primary age range.The school is   
 fortunate to have its own cooking     
 facility and dining area which enables
 most of the children to enjoy a good  
 meal during the day.
