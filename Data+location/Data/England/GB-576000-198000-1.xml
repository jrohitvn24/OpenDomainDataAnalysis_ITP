		<title>01Life in Woodham Ferrers</title>
		<content> The following extracts are taken from 
 childrens' writings: "My life is all  
 for sports, such as karate, swimming, 
 football, rounders and cricket. My    
 best friend is called Darren. He is   
 12. We go for walks over the fields,  
 make camps in bushes, climb trees and 
 ride our bikes. My brother Michael and
 I look after foreign birds. We have   
 got four budgerigars, one zebra finch,
 one Californian quail, a cockateille  
 and a pair of canaries. My Mum has her
 own company called Matrix             
 Communications. My Dad works at a     
 bank. Soon my Dad will leave his job  
 and work with my Mum. My favourite    
 school work is maths, games, country  
 dancing and PE. In 12 years time I am 
 hoping to be a solicitor. In my spare 
 time I want to be an astronomer. On my
 birthday I want a big telescope."
