		<title>18VECHILE SURVEY</title>
		<content> A survey was carried out in July 1985 
 on cars in our area.  We found there  
 was a total of 98 vehicles.  Of these 
 58 were British, 13 Japanese, 13      
 German, 8 Italian, 4 French and 2     
 Swedish.  There were also 4 vans.  We 
 visited 80% of the houses and farms   
 and found that out of these, 6 houses 
 did not own a car or other vehicle of 
 any kind.  This means that for        
 approximately every 16 houses, 1 house
 does not own a car.  We (the children 
 in school) were pleased to find in    
 this area most people buy British     
 cars.                                 
 A thrice daily bus service runs from  
 Derby via Long Lane to Longford.
