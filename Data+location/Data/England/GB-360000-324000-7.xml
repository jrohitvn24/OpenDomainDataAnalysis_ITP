		<content> The chapel of the Epiphany is a very  
 small chapel which is part of Hodnet  
 Parish; up until 1948 it was a private
 chapel belonging to Peplow Hall.      
 Services are held on all the main     
 Festival Days plus Evensong each 1st  
 Sunday in the month, Choral Communion 
 each 3rd Sunday and Family Service,   
 with a bias towards the children, held
 when there is a 5th Sunday in the     
 month.                                
 The church shares its Rector with     
 Hodnet &amp; Weston-under-Redcastle. Being
 a farming community the Harvest       
 Festival service held in October is   
 very well attended with numbers for   
 ordinary services averaging less than 
 20.                                   
 Most of the money needed to keep the  
 church running has to be found through
 Fund Raising and Covenants.
