		<title>11SUDELEY CASTLE - HISTORY Pt1</title>
		<content> The name Sudeley, comes from two Saxon
 words - 'sud' 'lega' which means south
 place. The castle was a Royal Manor   
 which belonged to King Ethelred II. In
 Saxon times the castle was at the     
 centre of the Kingdom of Mercia.  (7) 
 Sudeley was a very important place.   
 In 1066, after the Norman conquest,   
 William gave away all the best land.  
 The castle then belonged to the De    
 Mantes family. As they were part      
 French they were able to keep the     
 castle. After the De Mantes family had
 died, they left the property to the De
 Sudeley family.They were in occupation
 at the time of King Stephen. John De  
 Sudeley married Matilda, and after    
 disagreements with King Stephen the   
 castle was lost to the family and     
 turned into a garrison. After the     
 King's death, the castle returned to  
 the De Sudeley's remaining until 1367.</content>
