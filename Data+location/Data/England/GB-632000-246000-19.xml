		<content> Apart from the USAF Base this is an   
 area of few houses. The Base has a    
 Youth Centre and football, basketball,
 baseball,tennis,etc. are played. Local
 foresters' interests are mainly out-  
 door: ornithology, photography, P.T., 
 and walking. Riding in the forest is  
 by permit and deerstalking and shoot- 
 ing are leased out. Poaching is not an
 official sport but certainly goes on! 
 Local people have practical interests:
 car maintenance, fishing, gardening   
 and apiary; other hobbies are poetry, 
 goldpanning, folkdancing and singing, 
 beachcombing and shadow puppets. Some 
 help with Guides, Senior Citizens and 
 the physically handicapped. In winter 
 winemaking, reading and T.V. are      
 popular. Most keep dogs who guard the 
 more remote homes. One historian/actor
 provides a weekend retreat for com-   
 posers and actors.                    </content>
