		<title>18Dialect in Ulverston</title>
		<content>   Dialect words are still part of     
 everyday speech in Ulverston. The fol-
 lowing is an example.                 
   "I traipsed out of our ginnel. I was
 in a right epie and booted a l'al     
 clemmy in t'dyke. I went t'park yonder
 and see'd a girt seapie. I took up    
 mi buttie an' ligged it at it,but it  
 jus' flew off. I recon it were a bit  
 kysty. An' I recon it were nesh an'   
 all cos it were reet kecken itsen.    
 Then I went yam."                     
   In ordinary English this means:     
   "I walked out of our alley. I was   
 feeling really angry and kicked a     
 small stone into the hedge. Then I    
 made my way to the park over there and
 saw a big seagull. I took up my sand- 
 wich and threw it to it,but it just   
 flew off. I think it was being fussy  
 and I think it was soft too because it
 seemed frightened.Then I went home."  </content>
