		<content> Our school is called ST. JOSEPHS      
 R.C.V.A. PRIMARY SCHOOL.It was built  
 in 1891,but it has been added to since
 then.The sisters of LA RETRAITE own   
 the building and have to keep it in   
 good condition.We have 7 classes      
 now,one for each year.Our headmistress
 is a nun,as is the deputy.            
 School starts at 8:55 and we do 5 and 
 a half hours work each day.We enjoy   
 playing on the adventure              
 playground,and also enjoy all our     
 sports.We have lots of helpers to     
 cook,clean &amp; supervise us during the  
 day.Some mums come in to hear us      
 read,&amp; sometimes we go out on trips to
 Taunton Museum,Torquay,Kilve &amp; even to
 London.We have to wear school         
 uniform,blue in colour.Our P.T.A.     
 helps us to make some extra money to  
 buy equipment we couldn't otherwise   
 afford.Ours is a HAPPY SCHOOL.        </content>
