<title>15Hemsford in 2011</title>
<content>

Hemsford has now moved into full residency from it's former holiday venue role. I bought the main farmhouse with my wife Liz, sons Bill, Lewis and Myles, and my wife's now elderly parents, Joan and Bob. The cottages are now partly owner occupied and partly for rental. We also own one of the rental cottages, lived in by Ada, a previous Dutch domicile. There are some real eccentric characters living here, and some stories to tell!  We love living here deep in the Devon hills, being the quietest place on Earth on occasion. We keep horses and chickens and occasionally fish in our trout pond. Joan has a thriving market garden going, feeding everybody who needs it. I'm looking forward to my eldest son Bill turning 18, so we start walking to the local pub for research purposes. The dark skies we get here give a fantastic view of the moon and stars on clear winter evenings. I honestly feel I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.   &lt;br />
