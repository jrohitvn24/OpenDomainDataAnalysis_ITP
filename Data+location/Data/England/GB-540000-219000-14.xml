		<title>14 Architecture of Much Hadham</title>
		<content>   At the North end of the village the 
 houses are practically continuous and 
 the natural curve of the road         
 emphasizes the row of different sized 
 buildings abutting straight onto the  
 pavements with no front gardens. These
 houses date mostly from the 16th and  
 17th centuries. They are of timber and
 plaster construction with steep       
 pitched roofs. Some have Georgian     
 fronts, some are half timbered and    
 there are prominent gables, tall      
 chimneys and pretty windows and       
 porches. Most of these buildings were 
 small shops.This year marked the end  
 of Betty Saunders' little shop, much  
 loved by the children especially.     
   Together with these are a number of 
 medium sized country houses of some   
 architectural interest.Most of these  
 houses are ofthe Georgian period but  
 are built on the sites of older ones. </content>
