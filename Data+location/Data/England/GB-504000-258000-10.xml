		<title>10Charity Trusts, Thurleigh</title>
		<content> There are 2 charitable trusts that    
 have been set up in Thurleigh. Free   
 School Trust - This was set up with   
 the interest made on the sale of the  
 Old Lace School in Thurleigh. The     
 money is available to help any of the 
 village children to pursue further    
 education. It is available to help    
 towards the purchase of books or if   
 anyone is fortunate enough to get an  
 apprenticeship money will be provided 
 for buying tools. The Harvey Charity -
 This money is the interest on the sale
 of the Old Red Lion public house.     
 Originally the interest was handed to 
 the poorest of the poor every         
 Christmas. Now money is given to all  
 the pensioners at Christmas and       
 hampers to families in special need   
 and single parent families. In the    
 case of a diaster the charity gives   
 financial aid to those in need.       </content>
