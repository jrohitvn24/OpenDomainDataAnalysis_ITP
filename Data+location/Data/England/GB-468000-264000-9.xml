  Apart from Althorp Park which are the
grounds of Althorp House,the area is   
undulating farm and grass land with    
several pockets of woodland.Walkers    
should beware of large hidden holes    
where thick undergrowth has colonised  
old quarries.                          
  Harlestone Firs is unique in the     
County.Lying on a belt of acid sands,  
most of the trees are conifers.It is a 
popular haunt for walkers,horse riders 
and nature lovers;a nature trail       
opening up in the 1970s.               
  There are many footpaths and bridle  
ways especially around Harlestone.The  
main footpaths are clearly marked with 
gates and metalled surfaces.           
  The climate is equable with less than
average rainfall.
