		<content> Like so many old villages,Brereton had
 its own{water-mill,}but because it had
 to be built where there was a constant
 supply of water,it stands about a mile
 from the centre of the village,in the 
 valley of the{River Croco. }          
 The present mill was built in about   
 1800 on the site of previous mills    
 thought to go back to the original    
 Domesday period.The mill is in part   
 now used for living accomodation,but  
 the workings and wheel are still in   
 existence awaiting a new lease of life
      {The church ofSt.Oswald}stands in
 peaceful surroundings near the Hall.  
 The earliest date that can be         
 identified with this beautiful church 
 is around 1200 AD. Perpendicular in   
 style,the fabric was rebuilt during   
 the 15th Century.Now built of red     
 sandstone,there are clues that the    
 original construction was of timber.  </content>
