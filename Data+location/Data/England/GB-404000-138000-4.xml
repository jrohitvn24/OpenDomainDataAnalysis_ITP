		<title>04Berwick Church: St.James</title>
		<content>{St.James}is built largely of local    
 materials: field flints to reduce the 
 expense of stone from a distance,     
 though clay tiles have replaced the   
 original thatch.                      
 Berwick church is 75 feet long and    
 without aisles. Its oldest feature    
 is the{twelfth century doorway,}with  
 carved heads supporting the beams     
 inside. The medieval stone pulpit is  
 one of two surviving in Wiltshire,    
 originally entered by a staircase in  
 the wall halfway down the nave.       
{Reverend Adams,}the present incumbent 
 is extremely unusual nowadays in that 
 although at present he covers Berwick,
 Stapleford and Winterbourne Stoke he  
 uses no form of transport at all and  
 is often to be seen walking between   
 his parishes.                         
{Services}are held once a fortnight.
