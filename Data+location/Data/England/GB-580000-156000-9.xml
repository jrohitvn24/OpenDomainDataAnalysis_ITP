		<content> Thurnham School is a Church of England
 School, and the basic philosophy is a 
 Christian one. Assembly is held on 4  
 days and one per week is conducted by 
 the local clergy. Children start      
 school in the term after their 5th    
 birthday, and go to Junior School in  
 the September following the 31st Aug  
 by which time they are 7. The main    
 subjects taught are reading, language,
 handwriting and mathematics. Art and  
 craft play a large part, and the      
 younger children spend most afternoons
 choosing their own play. For the older
 ones the lessons are more intensive.  
 The school day is from 9am. to noon,  
 and 1.30 to 3.30pm. with a 15 minute  
 playtime in both sessions. A cooked   
 lunch is provided at a cost of 60p per
 day, though more than half the pupils 
 choose to bring packed lunches.
