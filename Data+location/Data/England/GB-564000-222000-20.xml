		<title>20Farming,Stebbing Essex</title>
		<content> The land in our part of Essex is some 
 of the richest farmland in the country
 There is very intensive arable farming
 and most farms are between 100 and 200
 acres.Farming is highly mechanised and
 a farm can be efficiently run by only 
 two or three men using sophisticated  
 machinery.The main crops are          
 wheat,barley and potatoes.Some sugar  
 beet is grown,but since acreage was   
 limited by the Common Market ,farmers 
 grow less.They now grow quite a lot of
 oil seed rape,which is used in cooking
 oils and margarine.                   
  There are some poultry farms         
 producing eggs,but virtually no other 
 livestock,apart from a herd of        
 Highland cattle and many horses and   
 ponies.
