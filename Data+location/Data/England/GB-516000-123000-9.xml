		<content> The first question we asked was were  
 they scared about burglaries. We got  
 an abrupt answer NO.Then we found out 
 that in 1889 it was a{blacksmiths     
 forge.It changed 27 years later into  
 the{Nuthurst Arms}, but it was not a  
 pub for long because it became a shop 
 in 1918 (two years later).We asked the
{value of their stock}when they were   
 fully stocked. It would come to about 
{Â£4000-Â£5000}.Their oldest products are
 butter and cheese.The{opening times   
 are (in the week) 9.00am - 5.30pm. On 
 Saturday its only open from 9.00am -  
 1.00pm (it's not open on Sundays).    
 There are two big deliveries a week,  
 from either{Chichester}or{Maidstone.  
 The most bought product is groceries. 
 The people who own the shop are Mr and
 Mrs Gladdish. They have to keep the   
 post office open but the shop brings  
 in more money.                        </content>
