		<title>17Ampleforth Cadet Force</title>
		<content>  Ampleforth College has a Combined    
 Cadet Force comprising three sections:
 Army, Navy and Air Force.             
  The bulk of the ranks are made up of 
 14 and 15 year-olds, who have to do 2 
 years basic training. The rest of the 
 members are volunteers from the senior
 part of the school. The aim of the CCF
 is to give the boys an idea of the    
 forces and to encourage those         
 interested in military careers. In the
 army section the cadets are given     
 basic training in drill, weapons,     
 field crafts and survival. In the Navy
 the trainees are instructed in ships  
 of the line, navigation, basic drill  
 and take part in army events. The RAF 
 cadets are taught the basic rudiments 
 of flying and put them into practice, 
 in their second year, in the air at   
 RAF Leeming, and on the ground with   
 computer flight simulators.           </content>
