		<title>11THE LANDSCAPE OF EAST WELLOW</title>
		<content> The landscape of East Wellow is       
 basically a rural one, but one that   
 is also changing. Farms are becoming  
 bigger and highly mechanised and this 
 means that big fields are needed for  
 crop growing. Crop growing is         
 concentrated in the east of this area 
 and this is where the enlargement of  
 fields and removal of areas of        
 woodland and hedges has been most     
 notable. Some new woodlands have been 
 planted, especially poplar            
 plantations, which are a              
 characteristic of this area of        
 Hampshire.                            
                                       
 Agricultural land uses dominate the   
 area completely.The west is dominated 
 by grassland in smaller fields for    
 livestock important among which are   
 horses. The east of the area has more 
 arable land,but also more woodland.   </content>
