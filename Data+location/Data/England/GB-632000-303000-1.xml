		<content>{ An"overview"of the study area.       
 The study area as a whole is          
 sparcely populated,mainly rural in    
 character,and for the most part well  
 away from the main lines of national  
 communication.The reduction in the    
 "farm" labour force has made an impact
 particularly in Claxton,and to a      
 lesser extent in Rockland St.Mary,    
 cutting back the population           
 dramatically in the immediate past,   
 consequently the elderly who tend not 
 to move,constitute a very high        
 proportion of the total.Latterly  an  
 influx of"new blood",into newly built 
 "character"properties has stemmed this
 drift;most owners working in Norwich. 
 It is likely that its comparative     
 remoteness,its lack of direct         
 comunications and its inclusion in the
 "Green Belt"and Coun. Develop.Scheme  
 will save it from more develop.       </content>
