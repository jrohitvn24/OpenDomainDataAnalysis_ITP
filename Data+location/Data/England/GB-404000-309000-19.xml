		<title>19GERALD HOWARTH M.P.1.</title>
		<content>                     Robert Leadbeater.
On Sunday 30th June Robin Budinac,Paul 
Jones and myself went for an interview 
with the M.P. for Burntwood and        
Cannock,Gerald Howarth.We asked him 12 
questions about his job and duties.    
  Gerald Howarth represents 70,000     
people over the age of 18 that live in 
Burntwood and Cannock area.He is one of
650 M.P's in the U.K..He was elected to
Parliament in June 1983.               
  His job involves taking part in the  
great national debates in the Houses of
Parliament.All sorts of things are     
brought before Parliament.             
  Gerald Howarth's job is very         
complicated.This is a  typical day:-   
  The first thing that he does is to   
open the post to see what people have  
written about.People write to him about
all sorts of things.They write in to   
tell him their ideas and problems.     </content>
