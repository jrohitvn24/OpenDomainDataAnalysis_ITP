		<title>10The River Stour</title>
		<content>In the past London needed wheat and    
barley for bread and beer and bricks   
for building.Villages and towns along  
the Stour could provide them.Roadswere 
bad So a company was formed to widen   
and deepen the river from Sudbury to   
Maningtree allowing barges to carry    
these goods to London and coal to be   
brought back.Locks and weirs were built
and the barges were pulled by horses.  
Mills,warehouses and wharves were also 
built and the company charged tolls to 
use the river.The building of the Gt.  
Eastern Railway caused the company to  
close in 1914 and destroy their barges.
The river today is only used for       
leisure (fishing and boat trips) but   
Cornard Lock is to be rebuilt,Cornard  
Mill remains as do the wharf and       
warehouse at Sudbury.The Colchester/   
Sudbury Railway built in 1849 caused   
the closure of the Stour Navigation.   </content>
