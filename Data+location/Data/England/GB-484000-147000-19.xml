		<title>19Hop Kilns Project</title>
		<content>    The Hop Kilns were built in{1886}  
 for the purpose of drying hops. The   
 kilns and the land were owned by Mr.  
 Walter Tice.                          
    The{restoration project}was started
 8 years ago and will probably take    
 another 6 years to finish. The land   
 and the kilns were purchased for      
 Â£16,000 and already more than{Â£55,000}
 have been spent on the restoration.The
 money was raised by the local people. 
    The first rooms in the restored    
 building were opened on{4th May 1985 }
 by  Mrs.Virginia Bottomley who was the
 local Member of Parliament.           
  { The Hop Kilns are now used}by play 
 groups for pre-scholl children,wives  
 groups,an American Football team and  
 as a practise hall for a local band.
