   The Pharmacy is owned by a          
Pharmacist who has been there for 25   
years. The shop used to be a family    
cottage. Four people are employed in   
the Dispensary and five staff in the   
shop. It is open on Saturday but       
closed Wednesday afternoon. Sometimes  
emergency prescriptions are provided   
outside these hours. To qualify as a   
Pharmacist one has to take a B.Sc.     
course and then do a year's practical  
training. Most of the 200 to 300 daily 
customers are from Shoreham, Otford and
Kemsing. The busiest times are winter  
for the Pharmacy and summer and        
Christmas for the shop. The dangerous  
drugs are locked in a special cabinet. 
Supplies are obtained from Unichem who 
take three hours to deliver and from   
Burroughs Welcome who have computerised
memory lists.                          </content>
