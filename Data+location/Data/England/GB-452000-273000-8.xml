		<content> Long ago canals were used for         
 delivering iron,steel and coal.The    
 boats were horse drawn but when they  
 came to a small bridge the horses     
 would go round it.The men would have  
 to use their feet to push on the      
 bridge to make the boat go along.When 
 they came out on the other side they  
 put the horse to work again.Nowadays  
 most canals are used for fishing and  
 pleasure boating.A lot of people take 
 a holiday on the canals.              
 The canal running through Hillmorton  
 is the Oxford canal as it runs through
 to Oxford.The canal was opened in 1790
 There used to be three single locks   
 but as traffic increased three new    
 locks were made in parallel and still 
 stand today.In 1842 no fewer than     
 20 859 boats passed through this part 
 of the canal.The locks are built to   
 take boats up to 72' long and 7' wide.</content>
