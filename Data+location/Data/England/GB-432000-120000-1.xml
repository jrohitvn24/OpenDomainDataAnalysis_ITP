		<title>01ROMSEY - INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>                                       
 ROMSEY is situated where town meets   
 country.  On one side it is almost    
 urban sprawl right down to            
 Southampton.  To the south-east many  
 new estates are being built destroying
 copses and open areas.  But for the   
 green belt Romsey would be a suburb of
 Southampton and Portsmouth.  On the   
 north side of Romsey there are new    
 companies housed in an industrial     
 estate making things such as plastic, 
 shoes and spices.  In the Middle Ages 
 the wool industry made Romsey rich.   
 Salmon and trout thrive in the cleaner
 Test.  Most farms are dairy so Romsey 
 does not have the problem of          
 fertiliser polution or destruction of 
 hedges to make larger fields.  There  
 are many buildings with preservation  
 orders and tourists flock in to see   
 the Norman Abbey and Broadlands.      </content>
