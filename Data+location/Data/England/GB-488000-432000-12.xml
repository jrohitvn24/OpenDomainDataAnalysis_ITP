    "Come on Suggy, let's go down to   
 Skipo's"  "All right, we can maybe    
 lark army as well"   "Shall we call   
 for Anne?"  "Only if Skipo's playing" 
 "Let's go then".                      
 "Are you larking Dave?" "Okay"said    
 Dave"let's go and knock for Anne"     
 "Are you playing"said Suggy, "Sure,   
 just wait a minute while I get my     
 bike" Anne replied.   All four of us  
 went to our den and then to Jacko's to
 see him scramble on the building site.
 Jacko said"Shall we have a course like
 "Kick Start" "Okay" said Dave. James  
 went first and got bogged down and    
 finally Ally fell in the mud. We all  
 laughed but I don't think his mum did.
 Anne stalled and she was last.   We   
 all had a great afternoon and bought a
 Mr. Freeze icepop from the paper shop.
