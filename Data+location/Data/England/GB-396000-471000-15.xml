		<content> The Youth Hostel - In the last 12     
 months this has provided 42,000 meals 
 and 12,000 bed-nights, catering for   
 groups, schools and individuals.  It  
 is one of only six activity centres   
 listed by the Y.H.A., and is also a   
 Y.T.S. training centre for Manpower   
 Services. Caving, climbing,           
 pony-trekking, cycling, visits to     
 farms and lead-mines are part of its  
 schemes.                              
 Hag Dyke - once a lonely farmhouse    
 high up on Great Whernside, is now an 
 adventure hostel, with beds for 40    
 young people, up to 600 bed-nights a  
 year, run by 1st Ben Rhydding Scout   
 Troop since snow-bound 1947.  The     
 chapel adjoining is believed to be    
 Englands highest place of worship. A  
 wall-plaque commemorates the 40 Allied
 airmen of World War II who died on the
 surrounding hills.                    </content>
