		<content>    The{village}or{community policeman 
 is responsible for law and order in   
 the area.Although he is under orders  
 from the police headquarters,the      
 policeman covers a rural area  of     
 about 30 sq miles and is based at a   
 small police station/house.The        
 policeman works shifts the most common
 one being starting at 7.00a.m. and    
  finishing at 3.00p.m.                
    Much of the policemans time is     
 spent dealing with burglaries,traffic 
 problems and domestic arguments.In    
 the absence of the lollipop lady ,the 
 policeman will cross children over the
 road.The job the policeman dislikes   
 most is informing people after a death
 and signing a death certificate.      
    The policeman drives a small blue  
 car or van to travel round his area.
