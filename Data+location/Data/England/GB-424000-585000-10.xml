		<title>10Life Styles.</title>
		<content> The life style in Ashington varies a  
 lot in fashion.Most people wear what  
 they want then other people follow    
 them and most clothes become very     
 common.Some people wear very unusual  
 clothes such as tartan pant's with    
 studs,and a very glamerous hairstyle  
 to match.                             
   Another way of following friends is 
 by popstars.Some bands are very common
 and have millions of fans just in     
 Britain.Concerts are attended and lots
 of songs are sung.Now you can even buy
 T-shirts or join their fan clubs.     
   Evenings become a bit boring if you 
 are just watching television so most  
 people go out to clubs or old people  
 tend to go gambling at the local      
 bingo.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
