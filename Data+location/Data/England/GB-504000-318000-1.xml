		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO SOUTH LINCS</title>
		<content>                                       
     In this unspoilt area the land    
 cover is arable with some permanent   
 grassland and mixed woodland. There   
 is a variety of birds, butterflies,   
 wild flowers and animals.             
   The district, which is very sparsely
 populated, includes the small hamlet  
 of Lound,  part  of  the  hamlet  of  
 Scottlethorpe and a few farms.        
   Two main roads, the A151 Bourne  -  
 Colsterworth  and  A6121  Bourne -    
 Stamford run through the area,with an 
 infrequent bus service on each.  The  
 land rises gently to the west of the  
 small market town of Bourne, not too  
 distant from the Lincolnshire fens.   
   Recreational facilities are confined
 to horseriding, nature trails,walking,
 shooting and birdwatching.
