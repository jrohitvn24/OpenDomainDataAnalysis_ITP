		<content>   This section relates to page 19 -   
"Ghost village near Brackley".         
   The following is an excerpt from    
"History, Topography and Directory of  
Northamptonshire" by Whellan (published
in 1874).                              
   "Astwick and Plowman's Furze form   
the south and west sides of this       
parish. The former place contains about
670 acres and the latter about 500     
acres, the whole belonging to Magdalen 
College, Oxford. The village of        
Astwick, now consisting of a few       
scattered houses, is situated 11/2     
miles SW of Evenley. "It appears" says 
Bridges "to have been formerly a large 
town, as may be seen from the ruins,   
which are called the Old Town. There   
was formerly a manor house, the site of
which now is overgrown, but there is   
still remaining a moat full of water,  
150 paces along and 10 yards wide.""   </content>
