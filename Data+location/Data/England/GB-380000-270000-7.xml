 Fortified and crenellated by          
 successive Bishops,it became their    
 principal residence in the 16th       
 Century.In 1846 Hartlebury became the 
 sole palace of the{See of Worcester.  
   Over the years Hartlebury has       
 accommodated{Edward 1,}troops during  
 the Civil War and has been a prison   
 for Royalists and a College for       
 clergy.                               
   In 1964,the North Wing was adapted
