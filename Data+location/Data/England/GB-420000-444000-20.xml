		<title>20A Typical Saturday in Otley</title>
		<content> On a Saturday I awake at 9.00am.I get 
 dressed then go down stairs for my    
 breakfast,which is a bowl of          
 Cornflakes and a cup of tea.After I   
 then watch the television for three   
 quarters of an hour.                  
   I then go into town with my Mum and 
 buy the necessery things for that     
 week.                                 
   I then have my lunch which is       
 something light so it won't fill me up
 if I want to go out to play.          
   After my lunch I either play or     
 watch GRANDSTAND(a sports             
 programme)till about 5.00pm.Then I my 
 tea which is usually some salad.      
   After I watch television.While      
 watching I have some sweets,at a time 
 of about 10_10.30 I go to bed.
