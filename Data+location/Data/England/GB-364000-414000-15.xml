		<title>15BLEACHING AND DYEING</title>
		<content> Belmont Bleaching and Dyeing Company  
 has dealt in{textiles}for about       
 hundred years.It was originally a     
 paper mill.It is owned by a local     
 family.The company is the place of    
{employment}for about hundred workers. 
 85 of them are men.In earlier times   
 many{villagers}worked there,but       
 because of the attraction of the rural
 location of Belmont village,the price 
 of its property is now quite expensive
 and often bought by more affluent     
 commuters. Less than ten villagers now
 work there.                           
 The company is also able to waterproof
 and brush cloth as well as dyeing     
 cloth for dresses etc.It deals with   
 special cloth used in the{manufacture 
 of some attire for our military       
 forces.About 6,000,000 metres of cloth
 are dealt with in a year.
