		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF BLOCK</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
                                       
 Rottingdean and Saltdean are situated 
 along the southern coastal edge of the
 block with Ovingdean to the northwest 
 of Rottingdean. In the far northwest  
 the southern part of Woodingdean comes
 into the block. These communities form
 roughly half of the block, the        
 remainder being downland.  Some       
 downland is farmland used for crops   
 and animal husbandry, but much is open
 downland with wooded areas.  There is 
 also an area of Common Land at        
 Telscombe Tye to the east. There are  
 good local shopping, hotel and        
 entertainment facilities attractive   
 views for walkers and, nearby, all the
 amenities of Brighton.
