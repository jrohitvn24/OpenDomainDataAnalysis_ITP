		<title>08Farming-A Tickhill Farmer</title>
		<content> The man who lives at{Bagley Farm}has  
 been farming from when he left        
 school.Farming has always been in his 
 family since his grandfather started  
 farming and perhaps his father before 
 that.He has always lived and worked at
 Bagley Farm since he was a little boy.
 The farmer has{three people}working   
 for him on his{720 acre}farm.He       
 sometimes gets up at{0730}but at      
 pea-picking time he has to get up at{ 
{0630}which is very early.Sometimes he 
 has to get up in the middle of the    
 night to help with{lambing}or{calving.
 The farmers favourite job is using the
 power harrow because it makes his     
 fields look neat and tidy.And the job 
 he likes least of all,is fetching     
 pea-pickers from a neighbouring town. 
 His{wife}keeps the books and attends  
 to any secretarial work.Farming is a  
 seven day week job.                   </content>
