		<title>15CAMBERLOT HALL (cont.)</title>
		<content> After landing, the airman and the rest
of the crew were examined by an        
American doctor. This examination was  
carried out at what the airman calls a 
"fine mansion" somewhere near the      
airfield. The airman remembers the     
"fine mansion" under the name of       
Â£Camelot'.                             
 In 1984 resarch into this story was   
being carried out and the occupier of  
Camberlot hall recieved a letter with  
respect to this research.              
 Letters to the south coast press and  
the national aviation magazine         
Â£Flypast' and reference to salvage     
records appear to confirm the          
whereabouts of the airfield.           
 At this present moment in time it is  
still being established where the crew 
of the Liberator spent that night in   
July 1944 - but surely it was at       
Camberlot Hall !                       </content>
