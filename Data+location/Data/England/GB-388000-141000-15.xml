		<title>15A POSTMAN IN SUTTON VENY</title>
		<content>   My Dads job is a postman and so he  
 has to get up at 3 o'clock in the     
 morning. In winter time it can be very
 cold. Sometimes I go downstairs to see
 him get ready.                        
                                       
   It takes at least two to three hours
 to do one of his rounds.  He does     
 three deliveries.  He does a first    
 post, second post and a parcel        
 delivery to peoples houses.  On       
 Fridays he comes in at 7 pm and on    
 Saturdays at 11 am.                   
                                       
   A postmans job is very tiring       
 because he sometimes has to cycle or  
 walk, often he drives a post van.     
 One morning when it had snowed I had  
 to help my Dad deliver the post.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
