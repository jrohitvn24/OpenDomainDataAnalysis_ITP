		<content> AMONGST OUR AIMS THIS YEAR WE WANT TO 
 INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BOOKS AT THE   
 SCHOOL. WE ARE HOPING TO ADD TO THE   
 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE SCHOOL,    
 AND TO PURCHASE A LANGUAGE MASTER.    
    SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT    
 THEY WOULD LIKE TO SPONSOR A BOOK OR  
 BUY A BOOK FOR THE SCHOOL.            
    THE NEWSPAPER COLLECTION IS GOING  
 WELL AND THE SCHOOL HAS MANAGED TO BUY
 MANY USEFUL ITEMS WITH THE PROCEEDS   
 RAISED FROM ITS SALE,INCLUDING TWO NEW
 COMPUTER PROGRAMS.                    
    THE SCHOOL HAS ALSO STARTED A      
 BOTTLE BANK, AS YET WE RECEIVE NO     
 PAYMENT FOR THIS. WE DO HOWEVER FEEL  
 IT SERVES THE COMMUNITY,AND EVENTUALLY
 WE HOPE TO OBTAIN A USEFUL AMOUNT OF  
 CASH FOR THIS SERVICE.
