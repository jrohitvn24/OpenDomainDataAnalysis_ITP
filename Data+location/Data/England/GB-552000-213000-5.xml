		<content> Our school is 86 years old.  The      
 school was built in 1899 and on the   
 foundation stone it says,{"This stone 
{was laid by the very Reverend Henry   
{Montague Buttle D.D. Master of Trinity
{College, Cambridge.  Wednesday 25th   
{October 1899."} There is a legend     
 that behind the foundation stone      
 there is a pot of gold.  We have about
 130 children attending our school with
 five classes.  As well as the old     
 Victorian building we have a new block
 which at present houses the younger   
 children and we have our own swimming 
 pool.  Unfortunately we do not have   
 our own hall and we have to make use  
 of the nearby village hall for dinners
 and other activities.  There are many 
 out of school clubs at school such as,
 football, netball, chess, computers,  
 country dancing, athletics, swimming, 
 cricket and 5 star awards.            </content>
