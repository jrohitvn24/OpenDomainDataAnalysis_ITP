		<title>04Fire Service in Clun Area</title>
		<content> There are 11 firemen in Clun and none 
 of them are fulltime workers. The     
 engine is a Ford diesel and it will   
 hold 6 crewmen. It was installed in   
 the year 1979.The water tank will hold
 1800 litres. The diesel engine powers 
 the pump at the back of the vehicle.  
 The main clothes worn by a fireman are
 boots,leggings, fire tunic, helmet and
 gloves. The fire service has been in  
 Clun since the middle of the second   
 world war. Firemen know when to go to 
 the fire station because of their     
 alerters. The alerters are small black
 boxes which emit a sound when a       
 bleeper is activated. The fire men    
 must rush to the fire station  as soon
 as possible.
