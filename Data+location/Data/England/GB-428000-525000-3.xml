The farm we visited is called Carrsides
Farm. The farm is owned by Mr. and Mrs.
Wilkinson. They live in the farmhouse  
with their two sons, one daughter and a
nanny. Four people work on the farm but
more people help when they are busy.   
The farm covers 300 acres. There are   
eight large fields. The fields are used
for cows and crops. It is a big farm   
with lots of buildings  animals and    
machines. The farm was on the Eden     
Estate and has been there for over 300 
years. There is a combine harvester, a 
tractor and silage machinery. They grow
grass, wheat, barley and oilseed rape. 
There are 80 cows with their calves,   
500 hens and 12 sheep. The farmer marks
his cows with a brand mark or an ear   
clip.                                  </content>
