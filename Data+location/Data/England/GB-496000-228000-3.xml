 Bedford in the 1880s, two farms and   
 the rectory and{Church of St. Peter

 contains 54 people and 15 households  
 at the 1961 census. In 1377, 128      
 people lived in the area in 21 houses.
                                       
 The church, dating from the 13th      
 Century, is still used, sharing a     
 vicar with Milton Bryan and Woburn.
