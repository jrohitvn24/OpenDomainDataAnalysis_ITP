		<title>03FARMING : A WEARDALE FARM(2)</title>
		<content>    Our cattle are Aberdeen AngusX,and 
 GalawayX cows which all breed Limousin
 calves. We have 65 cows altogether.   
 All are beef cows. In the winter we   
 keep the cows inside at Weeds but they
 sometimes go to Killhope in the       
 summer.                               
                                       
    Our crops are silage and hay we    
 buy straw as well. They used to be all
 hay but we changed to silage in 1982. 
 The most important times of year are  
 lambing time, the auction sales and   
 looking after the stock in winter.    
                                       
   {NB.}Some Weardale farmers are now  
 changing from the traditional hay crop
 to silage production. 1985 was a      
 particularly wet summer and it was    
 very difficult to harvest the hay.
