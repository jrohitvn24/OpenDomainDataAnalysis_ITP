		<title>16TRANSPORT IN STOW</title>
		<content>{Pulham and Sons}of Bourton provide a  
 bus service from Stow north to        
{Moreton.}Most buses go to{Cheltenham  
 through{Bourton}though a few go       
 through{Lower Swell.}One bus a week   
 was provided to get to{Cirencester    
 after local government reorganisation 
 placed the District Council's offices 
 there.                                
  Moreton is the local{rail-head}after 
 the local station (2 miles away!) was 
 closed under the Beeching plan in     
 1962. From Moreton{London}is little   
 more than 90 minutes away.            
  Inevitably most people are obliged to
 have a{car}of some sort with a        
 surprising number of families having  
 two or even three vehicles.           
  The principal road through the block 
 is the A429, the Roman Fosse Way, a   
 busy holiday route from the Midlands  
 to the South and South-west.          </content>
