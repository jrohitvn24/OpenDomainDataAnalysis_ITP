		<title>04Halesworth Economics.</title>
		<content>Halesworth is the focul point for the  
economic activity of an area within a  
five mile radius.The main economic     
activity is retail trade,followed by   
financial services provided by banks   
,building societies,estate agents &amp;    
accountants.There is a large service   
area dominated by 5 garages.Rapid      
growth of Halesworth over the last 20  
years has meant that building companies
and retail suppliers have been very    
active,as have building societies and  
estate agents.Matthews Turkey factory  
is a major employer in the area. Grain 
production and storage is the dominant 
agricultural activity.Industry has     
declined since the 1960'swhen Howard   
Rotavators employed up to 600 people   
but two small industrial sites have    
been provided to encourage the return  
of industry to Halesworth.
