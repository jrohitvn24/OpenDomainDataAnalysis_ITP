Today Otley is a fairly small village  
with a few light industries.  There is 
Post Office and General Stores and a   
coach firm.  In the past it was not    
always so quiet.                       
                                       
Around the Post Office                 
----------------------                 
Here was the greatest amount of        
business and interest.  C. O. Jessups  
grocery and pork shop was noted because
he killed his own pigs.  Then there was
a harness maker who was always kept    
busy because of the number of horses   
used on the land.  There was Otley Hall
which ground farmers corn and supplied 
grain and maize or peas to be added to 
the mixture for pig feeding.  Then     
there was the grinding of oats and     
beans for cattle and horses.
