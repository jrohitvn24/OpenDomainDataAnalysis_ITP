		<content>Only about 5 of the farms in the area  
keep milking cows (about 500 in all),  
with between 300 and 400 followers.    
The predominant breed is Friesian,     
although one farm has Guernseys. About 
four farms keep sheep (mainly the      
Suffolk breed), and the flocks average 
around 400 in number. For beef cattle, 
the major breeds kept are Hereford and 
Friesian, but there is also one herd of
Limousin. Only two farms keep hens :   
one of these also has some Muscovey    
ducks (for meat), the other also has   
500 turkeys. About 20 goats are kept by
another farmer who sells the goats'    
milk.  Five farms keep horses for      
pleasure, although one uses the horses 
for farmwork.  Three of these five     
farms also breed horses. Millaway Farm 
which used to have a riding school, is 
a farm as well as Livery Stables.
