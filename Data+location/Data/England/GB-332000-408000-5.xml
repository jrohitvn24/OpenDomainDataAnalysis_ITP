		<title>05FARMING - THREE MOSSES</title>
		<content> Farming in this tract of land is      
 exclusively arable, producing crops of
 grain, potatoes and brassicas.  The   
 land is mainly of grade 3 quality. The
 crops grown are mainly send to markets
   at Liverpool, Preston etc., for     
 distribution in the Mid and South     
 Lancashire areas.  The brassicas are  
 of a very high quality, some being    
 packed at a local packing distribution
 centre.  Farm machinery does most of  
 the heavy work once done manually,    
 thus areducing the number of farm     
 workers needed.  There are only 8     
 farms in the area aemploying mainly   
 local people or family members.       
 Additional works are needed in the    
 Summer, these are usually made up of  
 students or those on job creation     
 schemes.
