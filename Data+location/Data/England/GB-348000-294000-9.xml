		<content>                                       
   The bus service was founded in the  
 1920's for transporting animals and   
 passengers to Shrewsbury market.The   
 business expanded rapidly when school 
 children from surrounding villages at 
 11+,needed transporting to Secondary  
 Schools in Coalbrookdale,Shrewsbury,  
 Church Stretton and Ludlow.           
    We now have a fleet of 14 vehicles 
 ranging from 12-53 seats with heaters,
 air-conditioning and air suspension,  
 the most luxurious having a toilet    
 compartment and television.           
    School transport is still the      
 backbone of the business but day      
 trips,holidays and tours-both home and
 Continental-form a substantial part of
 the firm and provide employment for 20
 full-time and part-time drivers.
