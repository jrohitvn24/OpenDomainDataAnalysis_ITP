 In 1929 Nettleton mine was            
 started.There were 8 strong horses to 
 pull the trucks up.Iron and steel was 
 mined out of the mines.They used      
 dynamite to make the mine bigger.There
 were trucks that held 1 ton and others
 that held 5 tons.There were 200       
 workers in the mine.There was 1 train 
 to pull some trucks in and out of the 
 mines.There were 4 entrances.All the  
 entrances are now bricked up.Behind   
 the mine there is a quarry.Chalk,lime 
 and granite were dug out of it.The    
 mine was closed in 1955 because it was
 too expensive to run.
