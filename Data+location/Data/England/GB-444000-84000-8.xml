		<title>08"Bowcombe"-Farming Changes 1</title>
		<content>   All the farmers in the area, and the
 older men in particular, testify to   
 the dramatic changes which have taken 
 place in farming in the last 50 years:
 akin to{a second Agricultural         
{Revolution.}                          
  {The most important have been the    
{developments in machinery which have  
{greatly improved efficiency, but more 
{significantly for society have reduced
{dramatically the number of people     
{employed in farming.}Of the cottages  
 along the road which 50 years ago were
 almost all occupied by farm workers;  
 only one is so occupied. Most have    
 been bought for use as retirement     
 homes or holiday homes by people, many
 of whom are from the mainland.        
  {A total dependence on machinery also
{brings problems when that machinery   
{breaks down. "Repairs are expensive   
{and spares are unobtainable".}        </content>
