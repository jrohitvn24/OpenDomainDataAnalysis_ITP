		<title>13LIFE STYLES IN MARSHFIELD</title>
		<content> The distinct geographical and social  
 community includes those whose roots  
 go back centuries and newcomers who   
 often choose to stay.  The sense of   
 identity found here along with the    
 beauty of the countryside creates a   
 friendly community where doors can be 
 left unlocked.  There are differences 
 of income, class, age and sex that    
 affect life styles, as does working in
 or out of the village.  The majority  
 of inhabitants lead peaceful lives and
 interact through a wide range of      
 societies.  The High Street when busy 
 with shoppers, reflects a relaxed     
 approach to dress, with the occasional
 high heel or green welly high-lighting
 opposite life styles. The young people
 anxious to assert their independence, 
 parade in jeans, play pop music and   
 manoeuvre with the opposite sex.
