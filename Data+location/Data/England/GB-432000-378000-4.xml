		<title>04        HOLMLEY LANE</title>
		<content> Holmley Lane is the last line of      
 development in this part of northern  
 Derbyshire.The path of the road lies  
 halfway down a steep slope and from   
 it, the land continues to drop away   
 and then flatter out northwards       
 towards Sheffield. In this directoin  
 the land cover is grassland for a few 
 farms and a piggery. The houses are   
 older semi_detached private housing.A 
 large old house with some more moderm 
 buildings behind set amongst the      
 housing is a hospital for handicapped 
 people.There are only a few shops     
 close in the nearby village of Coal   
 Aston but a bus service runs into     
 Sheffield.There is a doctor's surgery,
 pub and Infant School,near which is a 
 children's playgroud.There are a few  
 allotments for older people.
