		<title>06FAIRVIEW FARM, ALLET, TRURO.</title>
		<content> This is a mixed beef &amp; arable farm of 
 57\ acres run entirely by the middle- 
 aged Mr.&amp;Mrs.G.who intend to move soon
 to a smaller,more easily managed farm.
 Hay is produced as a crop, some of    
 which is sold locally although in most
 seasons it is sold further afield in  
 areas of short supply.  This is done  
 through relatives &amp; friends in the    
 north of England.  Capital is limited,
 so that the owners could not consider 
 either dairy-farming or large-scale   
 cereal production, both of which would
 require considerable investment &amp;     
 which are, it is felt, governed by too
 restrictive E.E.C. rules.  Cereal     
 production would be very risky without
 having full drying &amp; storage          
 facilities, apart from the fact that  
 there is already over-production.     
 E.E.C.quotas would make a change to   
 dairy-farming unviable.               </content>
