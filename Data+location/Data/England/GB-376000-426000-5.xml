		<content>   St. Pauls church belongs to our     
school and also  has a Sunday School.  
The Mother's Union, the school and the 
Sunday School also use the church.     
About thirty babies are christened     
there each year.  Only  two or three   
couples are married per year in the    
church. Some of the children of the    
school were baptised at the church.    
   Ebenezer Baptist Church was built on
the site of an iron foundry in 1856, in
Peel Street. Mr.MacGregor the pastor,  
and the elders own the church. The     
church has a Sunday school with about  
25 children and a mother and toddlers  
group.                                 
   St.Anne's New Memorial Church is a  
Roman Catholic Church. The priest there
likes to be called father. The church  
is 60 years old and is in the shape of 
a horizontal cross.
