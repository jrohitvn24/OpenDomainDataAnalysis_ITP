		<title>09ANCIENT HISTORY IN NETHERTON</title>
		<content> Originally known as Faccombe          
 Netherton, with Faccombe Up Street    
 being the hamlet on the hill. In the  
 14th and 15th centuries the Manor was 
 split and Faccombe Up Street became   
 the more important of the two         
 villages. The word Faccombe was       
 dropped from Netherton.               
 From 1967 to 1980 excavations were    
 carried out on the site of the 14th   
 century Manor, revealing approximately
 35 households. With a standard of 5 to
 6 people per home, the population was 
 about 200. Subsequent digging         
 uncovered remains from Saxon times.   
 The church was allowed to fall into   
 disrepair and the parishioners at     
 Netherton began to worship at the new 
 church in Faccombe in the late 19th   
 century. The original churchyard      
 remains at Netherton, the             
 well kept lychgate is dated 1896.     </content>
