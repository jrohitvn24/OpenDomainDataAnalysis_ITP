		<title>01   THE HIGHCLIFFE AREA</title>
		<content>             Our block for the Domesday
 Project overlooks{Christchurch Bay.}It
 includes the following local places:  
{Hinton, Eastern Highcliffe, Walkford, 
{Barton_on_Sea, Western New Milton}and}
{Old Milton.}The land is fairly  flat }
 and about 30 metres above sea level.  
 Many retired people live here and they
 mainly live in bungalows. Most of the 
 bungalows have been built since the   
 2nd World War. Many holiday-makers    
 come to the two caravan sites and some
 go to the beach. In the north there is
 some agricultural land. We are near   
 the{New Forest.}A railway station is  
 in the north of our block. Until 1974 
 all of our block was part of          
 Hampshire, but now part of it  is in  
 Dorset. There is just one small       
 industrial estate in{New Milton}which}
 has grown in the last few years.
