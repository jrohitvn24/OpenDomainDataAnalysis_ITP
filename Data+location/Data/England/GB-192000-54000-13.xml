		<title>13No Crime in Trethosa!</title>
		<content> An inhabitant of Trethosa was recently
 visited by an old friend from London. 
 They had met as schoolboys when the   
 Londoner was evacuated to Cornwall    
 during the war. The visitor found the 
 visit so relaxing after the constant  
 need fo security, guard dogs, and     
 burglar alarms back home. His host    
 explained in turn that if going out,  
 he would need to leave the door open  
 so that callers such as the football  
 pools collector would be able to      
 collect the money from the kitchen    
 table!                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
