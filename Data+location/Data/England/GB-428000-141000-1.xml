		<title>01THE AREA - General</title>
		<content> The area is entirely rural .It has    
 been found that most of it is         
 covered with crops.There is an        
 abundance of wild flowers to be found 
 .There are four plantations of        
 larch,cherry and evergreen trees.     
 The highest part in the area is 105   
 metres above sea level.Only a few     
 fields are to be found left for       
 grazing land.There are to be found    
 several disused chalk pits.The        
 chalk was used to build the local     
 houses in the distant past.           
 There are several woods in the area,  
 mostly made up of evergreen trees.It  
 is to be found that larch trees grow  
 in one of the plantations. Evergreen  
 trees grow in all of the plantations. 
 All the woods have deciduous trees    
 mixed in with the evergreens.
