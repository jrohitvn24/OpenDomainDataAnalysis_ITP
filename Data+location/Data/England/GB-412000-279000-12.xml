		<content> Solihull is served by the West        
 Midlands Passenger Transport Executive
 which provides routes passing through 
 and terminating there. Regular        
 services go all through our block     
 linking with Birmingham, Coventry, all
 local villages and stations. The      
 trains at Solihull station are timed  
 to provide a connection with the bus  
 service. The station is not very busy.
 Most of the trains are local, going   
 from Birmingham to Stratford. Close by
 is the main line station Birmingham   
 International on the National         
 Exhibition Centre site. Trains to     
 London Euston can be caught here.     
 There too is Birmingham Airport. The  
 M42 and M6 motorways are also near and
 when the M42 is completed soon these  
 motorways will be connected to the M1 
 and M4.
