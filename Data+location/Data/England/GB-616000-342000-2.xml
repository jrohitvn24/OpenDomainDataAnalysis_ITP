		<content>{Sheringham}is mentioned in the first  
{Domesday Book}but really refers to    
 what is now{Upper Sheringham.         
 Sheringham has been actively connected
 with the{fishing industry} since{1300,
 when letters of privilege were granted
 by the King.  The peak period was in  
 the{1880's when 26 large sailing      
{luggers and 250 small boats}operated  
 from this village.  In{1887}the       
{railway}came and Sheringham ceased to 
 be isolated.  Up to{1914}it was a     
 small quiet select resort but after   
 soldiers had been involved with local 
 coastal defence during the{1914-18    
 war, it became a popular resort and   
 the population increased.  Since the  
 Second World War the holiday patterns 
 have changed from long-stay to        
 week-end or week, camping, caravanning
 and educational school holidays. The  
 local Sheringhamite is a{"Shannock".  </content>
