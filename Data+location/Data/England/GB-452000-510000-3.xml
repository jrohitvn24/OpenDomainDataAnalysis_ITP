		<content>  Guisborough Road is the main A173    
 road running through Gt.Ayton from    
 Stokesley to Guisborough, so it       
 carries a lot of traffic (about 400   
 vehicles an hour in day time), mostly 
 cars but some buses and lorries. The  
 part-time Police Station is here as is
 the Victorian Christ Church, the      
 church hall and the village cemetry.  
 Here also is Yatton House, a day      
 centre for handicapped adults         
 partially ran and funded by charity   
 and partly by the social services.    
  Housing along the road begins as 19th
 century terracing at the Stone Bridge,
 the early 20th. century semi-detached.
 To the east is the 'Linden' area which
 is partly privately owned and partly  
 council estate, the houses of which   
 are now being bought by the tenants.  
 To the west are allotments and the    
 executive-type Skottowe estate.       </content>
