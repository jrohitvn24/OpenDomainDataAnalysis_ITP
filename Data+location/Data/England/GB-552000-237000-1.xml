 Saffron Walden is in the centre of our
 12 square kilometres. It is a market  
 town surrounded by farmland. The      
 nearest large towns are Cambridge to  
 the north and Bishop's Stortford to   
 the south.                            
 Saffron Walden's importance as a      
 market town has decreased over the    
 last two decades. This is because     
 there has been a move to arable       
 farming and because the town has grown
 as a residential are for people who   
 work outside the area. More than half 
 the working population commute to work
 outside the town. The main places to  
 which they go are Cambridge,          
 Stortford, Harlow and London. A lot of
 new housing has been built in the last
 15 years. The population has doubled  
 to 18 tousand.
