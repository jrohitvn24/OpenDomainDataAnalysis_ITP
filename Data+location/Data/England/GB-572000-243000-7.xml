		<content>  This school is due to close in July  
1986.It has only 7 children on roll.The
village put up a strong fight in 1977  
when closure was first suggested.In    
1979 the county council voted down the 
closure proposal but Stoke agreed to a 
self help scheme.The Mary Barnes       
Charity agreed to make an annual       
contribution to the costs and the      
county agreed to keep the school open  
until 1986.                            
                                       
  128 years after it was first         
established it will close;a  cause of  
concern to those in the village who    
believe this may have a   profound     
effect on the future of Stoke itself.  
  Will new families move to a village  
with no school or are they more likely 
to move to larger centres of           
population?
