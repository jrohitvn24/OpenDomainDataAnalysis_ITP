		<content> Pidgeon House Farm is a dairy farm and
 like many other farms in the area,it  
 is a family farm.The farmer has a herd
 of 130 cows,most of them Fresians with
 three Guernseys.He starts milking at  
 6:30am and finishes approximately     
 three hours later.He gets around 4,000
 litres of milk from each cow every    
 year.In 1985 the Milk Marketing Board 
 pay 10_15p for a litre of milk during 
 the year.Each cow has a calf annually.
 He sells the male calves,they fetch   
 about Â£50 each at market.Half the     
 female calves are kept and half go to 
 market,these fetch Â£40 each.A good    
 milking cow could cost Â£700 to buy,but
 the farmer rears his own replacements.
 Two_thirds of the cows have calves in 
 Autumn. Milking is done in a parlour  
 and collected in a tank.The local     
 dairy company collect,test and give   
 the farmer a computer number label.   </content>
