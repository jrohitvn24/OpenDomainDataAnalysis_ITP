		<content>     Most of us live in{houses}but some
 in{bungalows.}There are lots of cars  
 parked on the roads because there is  
 at least one car per household,       
 sometimes two, and lots of people     
 don't own a garage.                   
                                       
     There are narrow alleys connecting
 the streets; these are called{jitties}
 or {jennels}. These are short cuts    
 which save time when going from one   
 place to another. As we walk along    
 them, we can see the gardens which    
 belong to the houses: the flowers and 
 vegetables, garden sheds and the      
 fences all different colours, red,    
 blue and white.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
