 In{Langworth}there are not many       
 people.There is a play park in {      
{Langworth.}The school is very         
 small.There are shops in{Langworth}and
 a church. The church is not very big  
 but our vicar,The Reverend Raymond    
 Gibson has a group of four            
 parishes.This is a Church of England  
 (Controlled) School.Our special       
 assemblies and celebrations at        
 Christmas, Harvest and so on are often
 held in one of the churches before a  
 large congregation. Our village is    
 small and has few social              
 activities.However the Fete and       
 other events are well attended.
