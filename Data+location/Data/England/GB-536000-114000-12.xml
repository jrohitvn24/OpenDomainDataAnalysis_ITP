		<content> Trains go through Plumpton from Lewes 
 to London,Victoria or London Bridge.  
 There are few trains that stop        
 at Plumpton.They come from the South  
 coast,from Hastings or Eastbourne.They
 run extra trains on Plumpton race     
 days.The trains are not very plentiful
 now because local people  use their   
 cars to go to work in London,Haywards 
 Heath or Lewes.There are three bus    
 servicesin this area. The Southdown   
 bus only runs on a Friday,and goes    
 from Haywards Heath to Brighton,      
 passing through Plumpton. The         
 Lewes coach company runs every day    
 from Lewes to Haywards Heath.The new  
 bus,is the Village Rider.It runs      
 through Plumpton to East              
 Chiltingtington,but only a few times  
 during the day.It has a special ramp  
 for disabled people.
