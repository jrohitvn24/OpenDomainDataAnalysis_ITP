		<title>11A Tale of Two Pubs</title>
		<content> In Halfway House there are two pubs   
 next door to each other joined in one 
 building. This is unusual.The 2 pubs  
 are called 'The Seven Stars'and 'The  
 Halfway House Inn'.There is a lot of  
 difference between the 2 pubs.We live 
 in the 'H.H.Inn' which is bigger.It   
 has been said that the building (which
 is 200 years old) was one big one, but
 the family who owned it had a row.Some
 of the family put a brick wall between
 the two.We have a fairly good trade   
 but the other pub's trade is light.   
 The 'Seven Stars' has a lot of O.A.Ps.
 The 'H.H.Inn' has a more varied       
 clientele. Recently due to road       
 alterations the pub is no longer      
 situated right on the A458. The       
 landlord has therefore arranged chairs
 and tables outside the front. Unlike  
 the 'H.H.Inn' the 'Seven Stars' does  
 not cook food or have music.          </content>
