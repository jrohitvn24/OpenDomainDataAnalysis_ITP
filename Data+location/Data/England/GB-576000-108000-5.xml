		<content> On land by the Pebsham Landfill Site  
 the Rother District Council           
 administers a permanent site for      
 caravan dwellers.It opened in 1984.It 
 has 12 hard standings for caravans,   
 each with its own mains electricity   
 point and water point and mains       
 drainage,as well as a shower unit.Rent
 for each pitch is Â£11 per week.The    
 site is landscaped and well appointed,
 with vehicle parking space and an area
 for carrying on the business of scrap 
 dealing.Some of the site children     
 attend W.St.Leonard's School,but      
 others go to Saxon Mount and Torfield 
 Special Schools and Grove             
 Comprehensive School.School attendance
 is often irregular.The site caters    
 for those living in E.Sussex for some 
 time prior to applying for a place.The
 law now forbids gypsies to camp on    
 unofficial sites in this area.        </content>
