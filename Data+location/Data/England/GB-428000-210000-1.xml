There is a game called marbles. What   
you have to do is to tap each other and
roll the marbles along the ground.     
There are many ways to play marbles.   
This is how I play. I get a marble     
and I throw it in to the drain cover.  
It is the other persons go. The one    
nearest the drain goes first. If they  
get the marble in it is still their go.
If it does not go in it is the other   
person's turn. If he or she gets it in 
then they have won.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
