		<title>03Farm Life by Vicki Collin</title>
		<content>My dad is a farmer &amp; he, mum, my       
sister I live on a 68 acre farm 1 mile 
from Ambrosden.We have 54 cows, 7      
sheep, 9 lambs, 75 hens,7 chicks,8     
geese,8ducks, 6 ducklings.It is mainly 
grassland &amp; sometimes we grow crops of 
kale&amp; maize. Mum &amp; dad get up at 6     
every morning to milk the cows &amp;  I    
get up at 7.Morning milking takes 2    
hours as the tanker has to collect the 
milk to take to London. Evening        
milking takes 1&amp;3/4 hours then dad     
comes in &amp; tells us what the day has   
been like while we have dinner then we 
watch TV.Usually I take the dogs for a 
walk.When I get home from school I     
change, feed the cats &amp; hens &amp; help    
mum do the goats.At 4.45 I help mum    
get the cows in &amp; at 5.30 mum &amp; dad    
start milking.At weekends &amp; holidays I 
help mum in the mornings &amp; evenings &amp;  
sometimes I help with the milking.     </content>
