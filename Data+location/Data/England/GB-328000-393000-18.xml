		<content> The increase in popularity of cheap   
 foreign travel, together with an      
 increase in pollution of the River    
 Mersey and the gradual erosion of the 
 beaches lead to the decline of New    
 Brighton. Even today, several hotels  
 and houses display "For Sale" signs.  
 Many premises in Virginia and Victoria
 Roads are empty and derelict.         
 In recent years there has been an     
 increase of interest in New Brighton  
 as a recreation and amusement centre. 
 Pop concerts have been staged at the  
 open-air swimming baths. The Floral   
 Pavilion theatre is often filled to   
 capacity. The tennis courts, amusement
 arcades, bowling greens, sea fishing, 
 crazy golf, bowling aley and          
 restaurents attract, not only locals, 
 but also more and more people from    
 Liverpool.                            
                                       </content>
