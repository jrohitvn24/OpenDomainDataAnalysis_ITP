		<content>     At our school we did a survey of  
favourite programmes.We found that     
"Street Hawk" was the most popular.It  
is an American programme about a man   
who rides a motorbike and catches      
crooks.The next most popular was "Blue 
Peter" which tells you about things you
do not know.The presenters show you how
to cook things such as barbecue food   
and how to make things such as a doll's
house or Christmas cards;they also look
at things like a meteorite or miniature
Shetland pony."Biskits" was equally    
popular with "Blue Peter".It is a      
cartoon about puppies  protecting      
kings' treasure.
