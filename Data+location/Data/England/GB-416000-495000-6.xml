		<title>06PASS OFF PARADE</title>
		<content> The Brigadier was wearing a dark blue 
 suit with two red stripes down each   
 leg and a red stripe round his hat.The
 Brigadier inspected the troops and    
 talked to some of the soldiers.       
 Unfortunately,one poor lad fainted and
 had to be taken off the square.The    
 Brigadier moved to the dais.The band  
 began to play again as the troops     
 marched past,first in slow time,then  
 in quick time. As the troops passed   
 the marker they turned their heads to 
 the Brigadier while he took the       
 salute.To {Auld Lang Syne}the Pass Off
 Troops marched off in one direction   
 and the parade troops in another      
 direction.The Parade lasted 1 hour and
 10 minutes.The Pass Off troops will go
 elsewhere for Trade Training.
