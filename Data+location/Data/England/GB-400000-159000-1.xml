		<title>01DEVIZES,AN INTRODUCTION.</title>
		<content> Devizes is a market town with a       
 population of 11,000 and is one of the
 oldest boroughs in Wiltshire.Most of  
 Devizes early history centres around  
 the Castle,built on a site where two  
 Manors met,hence Devizes,from the     
 Latin "Ad Divisas," meaning "At the   
 boundaries."                          
 For nearly a century it has been a    
 garrison town but due to changes in   
 military structure the last personnel 
 left in 1983.The market and shopping  
 facilities are good and annual events 
 include a carnival,canoe race,and some
 exchanges related to the Towns of     
 Waiblingen in Germany and Mayenne in  
 France with whom Devizes is twinned.  
 Industry is centered around the       
 brewery and factories manufacturing   
 card products and foodstuffs.The chief
 source of employment is the large     
 Hospital at Roundway.                 </content>
