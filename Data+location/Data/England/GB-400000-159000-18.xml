		<title>18WILDLIFE IN DEVIZES.</title>
		<content> The best places to see wildlife in    
 Devizes are the old railway line and  
 the canal.Along the railway,foxes have
 their earths and badgers use it as a  
 passageway on foraging expeditions.The
 canal supports a variety of insects,  
 amphibians and waterbirds.            
 Devizes is the centre of the Wiltshire
 Trust for Nature Conservation,who have
 their offices there,together with a   
 shop selling many items related to    
 wildlife.The Trust was formed in 1962 
 and today manages over 40 reserves.Its
 aims are to safeguard important       
 wildlife sites,to advise on           
 conservation and to increase public   
 awareness of it.It depends upon       
 voluntary help and the support and    
 enthusiasm of its members.Junior      
 members belong to the 'Watch' group   
 and special talks and outings are     
 arranged for them within the County.  </content>
