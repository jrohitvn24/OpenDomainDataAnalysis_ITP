		<title>16NACTON HEATH SCHOOL,IPSWICH.</title>
		<content> This school is an 11-16 High School   
and is the main school for teenages in 
the South-East of Ipswich.             
 Following the introduction of         
Comprehensive education in the 1970's  
this school  was a result of the       
joining together of  two main schools, 
and even in 1985 has a split site.Only 
in  two years will the pupils of       
this school share the same site on     
Nacton Road. The Landseer road site    
will close.                            
 Much renovation is going on to improve
on the state of buildings,this has been
made more necessary by a fire,early in 
1985 which destroyed the school hall.  
 The school has approximately 1,100    
pupils and the site is adjacent to     
Priory Heath Infants School.
