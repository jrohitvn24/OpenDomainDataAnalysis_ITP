		<title>15ST. JOSEPH'S R.C. SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   St. Joseph's Infant and Junior      
 School is a Catholic school.The school
 was built in 1930 with the latest     
 additions being made in 1979.There are
 11 teachers at the school.The         
 Headmistress is Sister Monica and     
 there are 2 other nuns who teach at   
 the school.There is only one male     
 teacher.                              
   The school has a uniform, which is  
 red tie, navy jumper and white shirt  
 or blouse.There are about 290 pupils  
 at the school and they come from a    
 much wider area than most schools.    
 Some come from E.Tilbury by school    
 bus.The reason for this is that St.   
 Joseph's is the only Catholic school  
 in this area.The Infant school has 4  
 classrooms.In our survey the most     
 popular subjects taught were Art,     
 Computer work and Clay.
