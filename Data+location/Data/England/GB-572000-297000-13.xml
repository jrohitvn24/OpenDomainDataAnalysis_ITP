		<title>13EMPLOYMENT IN NORTHWOLD</title>
		<content> A large proportion of the population  
 of Northwold are self-employed within 
 the village and its local area.These  
 jobs include shop-keepers,newsagent,  
 coppersmith,artist, builders,         
 chartered quantity surveyor and       
 farmers.Although much of the land     
 around the village is farming land,   
 farming is not responsible for the    
 employment of a large number of people
 because farms tend to be highly       
 mechanised.                           
 Employment outside the village tends  
 to be divided equally between         
 professional and manual jobs.         
 Although some families have all adult 
 members employed outside the home,the 
 majority tend to have a working       
 husband with the wife staying at home 
 to bring up the children.             
 Northwold has a small proportion of   
 its population unemployed.            </content>
