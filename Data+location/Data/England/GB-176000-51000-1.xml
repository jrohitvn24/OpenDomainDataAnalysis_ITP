 Our area for the Domesday Project     
 consists mainly of arable land. There 
 are occasional holiday camps scattered
 throughout the area and a lot of old  
 disused tin mines especially around   
 Ventongimps and Wheal Frances where   
 mining used to be popular.            
     The area contains several small   
 villages but there are few shops and  
 so people have to travel to their     
 nearest town from time to time to make
 purchases. The majority of the        
 population,however,is connected in one
 way or another with the land and      
 consequeuntly is reasonably self      
 sufficient as far as the provision of 
 fresh food is concerned.              
  Apart from farming and work on the   
 land,many of the population suplement 
 their income from the tourist         
 trade which is a growing industry.    </content>
