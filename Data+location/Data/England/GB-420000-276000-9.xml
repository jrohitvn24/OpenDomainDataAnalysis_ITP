		<title>09Springfield  House.</title>
		<content> Springfield House was originally 196  
 acres, but now it is much smaller.    
 There were many owners:The Fishers    
 and Richard Moland,1739_1798,The      
 Boultbees,1798_1904,the Jacksons      
 1912_1941,and now finally it has      
 been turned into a boarding school    
 for disadvantaged children.           
   Before  Springfield House was built 
 there was another house in its place, 
 the floorboards of the present house  
 came from the former one.             
 When the Jackson family bought the    
 house in 1912 they made changes,the   
 glass conservatory was knocked down   
 and made into a ballroom.In the 2nd   
 World War the stables were used as a  
 hospital and a sort of tent was put up
 as extra area.The old walled kitchen  
 gardens have been turned into a nature
 reserve and recreation area and only  
 the apple trees remain.               </content>
