		<title>10SHOPPING IN BROWNHILLS.</title>
		<content>   Shopping in Brownhills has changed  
 considerably over the past 60 years.  
 The shops today are much larger and so
 are fewer than in the past. In        
 Brownhills in the 1920's you would    
 find such shops as milliner's,        
 blacksmith's and  pawn brokers. There 
 were 35 food shops at this time, but  
 now there are only 21. However,Tesco's
 supermarket is ten times larger than a
 1920's shop.                          
   A survey regarding shopping         
 facilities held on a market day       
 canvassed 46 ladies, the majority of  
 whom shopped in Brownhills at least   
 twice a week and this included their  
 main weekly food shopping. Some ladies
 did shop in Walsall Wood and Bloxwich,
 but clothes were bought mainly in     
 Walsall. Most people would like to see
 more childrens' clothes shops or      
 department stores in Brownhills.      </content>
