		<content> Transport in Ewelme is confined to    
 road transport. There is no railway   
 within the village the nearest station
 being at Cholsey Henley or Didcot,    
 some 5,10 or 9 miles away             
 respectively. Each station provides   
 fast commuter servics to and are used 
 by several Ewelme residents. The River
 Thames flows about 3 miles away from  
 Ewelme with all its attendant river   
 traffic but the stream flowing through
 Ewelme itself is not large enough for 
 boating. Several families in the      
 village do, however, enjoy sailing and
 boating as a leisure activity. Cars   
 are the most common form of transpot  
 for most villagers, indeed, there are 
 many families with two or more cars.  
 The car has become a virtual necessity
 to most people as public transpot has 
 become very limited. There are 4 buses
 a day which go into Wallingford from  </content>
