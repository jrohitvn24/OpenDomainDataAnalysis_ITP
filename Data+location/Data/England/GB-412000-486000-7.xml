		<content> Middleham and the surrounding area    
 attracts many tourists. James         
 Herriot's books and television series 
 have revealed its beauties far and    
 wide.   There are many guest houses,  
 inns and houses offering bed and      
 breakfast. Particular interesting land
 -marks are the castle built around    
 1170 on an impressive site over look- 
 ing a small town. It is known as the  
 'Windsor of the North' and is famous  
 for its connections with Richard 111. 
 The stone houses are solid and        
 impressive; many built of stone       
 pillaged from the castle.   Middleham 
 Church dating mostly from the 14th &amp;  
 15th century is very attractive.      
 East Witton is a charming picturesque 
 village with its green sandwiched     
 between 2 rows of pretty stone        
 cottages.
