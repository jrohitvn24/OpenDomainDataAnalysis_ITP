		<title>19Lundy's Past.</title>
		<content> He improved the castle (see p.4) and  
 continued to hold Lundy long after    
 the Parliamentarian victory.Eventually
 Lundy once again became the haunt of  
 pirates.                              
 In the 1700s Thomas Benson leased     
 Lundy.He became an M.P. and took on a 
 contract to transport convicts to     
 Virginia and Maryland.Infact he only  
 took them to Lundy where he put them  
 to work,farming and building.He was   
 also engaged in smuggling and Benson's
 Cave can be found just below the      
 castle.                               
 After a succession of owners Lundy    
 was bought in 1834 by William Hudson  
 Heaven and thus began a period often  
 called the Kingdom of Heaven.Certainly
 many improvements and developments    
 were made by the Heavens. In 1836     
 Millcombe was built and a new road    
 from the beach was constructed.{(cont)</content>
