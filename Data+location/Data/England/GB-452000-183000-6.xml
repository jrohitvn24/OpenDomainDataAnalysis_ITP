RESULT OF A BEQUEST"FOR THE BENEFIT OF 
THE POOR OF BLEWBURY"BY WILLIAM        
MALTHUS,A NATIVE OF THE VILLAGE,IN 1700
HE HAD DIRECTED THAT THE BISHOP OF THE 
DIOCESE(SALISBURY IN THOSE DAYS)SHOULD 
PROVIDE A SCHEME FOR ALLOCATING THE    
MONEY.THE BISHOP'S SCHEME WAS THEREFORE
TO ESTABLISH A CHARITY SCHOOL.NOTHING  
COULD BE DONE FOR SOME TIME,BUT IN 1707
A HOUSE WAS RENTED AND A SCHOOL FOR    
FIFTY POOR CHILDREN STARTED.LAND WAS   
PURCHASED AT NOKE,NEAR OXFORD,AND THE  
RENTS FROM THIS PROVIDED THE INCOME FOR
THE SCHOOL.SO,IN 1709,THE SCHOOLHOUSE

PURPOSE.
