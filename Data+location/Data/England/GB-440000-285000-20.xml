		<content> The production of the{MOTOR CAR}some  
 100 years ago has had a dramatic      
 effect on village life over those     
 years. Before the advent of the car   
 some villagers hardly ever left the   
 confines of the village during their  
 whole life-time. Now-a-days most      
 villagers are able to{TRAVEL}virtually
 at will. Linked with this freedom to  
 travel has been an increase in{LEISURE
{TIME}due to shorter working hours.This
 has led to people wanting and becoming
 involved in more and more leisure     
 pursuits. In Wolvey there is a        
 plethora of activities covering all   
 age groups. With increased{MOBILITY  }
 villagers can now go to nearby towns  
 for activities not provided in the    
 village.
