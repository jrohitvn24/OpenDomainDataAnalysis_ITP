		<title>07The Tricorn Shopping Complex</title>
		<content>   The Tricorn Centre, voted 3rd most  
 ugly building in Europe, consists of  
 spiralling concrete above shops.      
                                       
 "The Tricorn Centre, a horrible place,
 Lacks all beauty and has no grace.    
 Grey concrete walls weathered and worn
 Spray-paint graffiti's been drawn.    
 You have to drive up a spiral ramp    
 At least two storeys high             
 To reach the dingy car park           
 Way up in the sky.                    
 Avoiding steep ramps and bollards     
 You pay to park your car.             
 Use the stairs to descend             
 You'll be walking very far.           
 The other way to leave the park       
 Is by lifts, both dank and dark.      
 To the ground you do descend,         
 Reach the shops, with money to spend."
