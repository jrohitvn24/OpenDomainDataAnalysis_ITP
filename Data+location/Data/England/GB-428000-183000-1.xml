		<title>01Uffington-Downland Farms</title>
		<content> The area covered by block 4km x 3km is
 principally agricultural and mainly   
 cereal foods (wheat, barley, oats).   
 There ae also large areas of grassland
 for grazing, silage and hay. Woodland,
 often referred to as spinneys and     
 plantations are to be found bordering 
 the cultivated and grassland areas.   
 The existance of the Ancient Monuments
 Wyland Smithy and the Ridgeway Path,  
 attracts the walker and tourist.      
 During the summer months the area is  
 teaming with visitors to the White    
 Horse, Wayland Smithy and the         
 Ridgeway Path.                        
 The Downs provide good exercise areas 
 for race horses and since Uffington   
 has racing stables at Kingston-Warren,
 training gallops cover part of this   
 area.                                 
 The farming community is rather small,
 most of the farms being tenanted,     </content>
