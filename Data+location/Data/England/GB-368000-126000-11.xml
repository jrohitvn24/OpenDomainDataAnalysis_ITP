		<title>11RELIGIOUS LIFE IN WINCANTON</title>
		<content>  I talked to the{Rector}of the Parish 
 Church. The Rector deals with many    
 people in trouble. When someone dies  
 he visits the relations, tries to     
 under-stand their feelings and        
 arranges the service with them. He    
 talks to sick people in hospital and  
 old people in nursing homes and helps 
 to make them feel better. He takes the
 Sunday{Services}in church, baptises   
 babies and conducts marriages.He opens
 fetes and makes speeches, such as     
 crowning the Rose Queen at the Primary
{School}Revels. Other churches are     
 Catholics,Methodists, Baptists,Quakers
 and Wincanton Christian Fellowship.   
 All churches teach that{Jesus Christ  
{died}so we may be forgiven by God, and
 rose from the dead so people, who put 
 their faith and trust in Him, may live
 in heaven for ever.
