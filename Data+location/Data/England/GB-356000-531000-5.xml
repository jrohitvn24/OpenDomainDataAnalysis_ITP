		<content> Phillip's Mum wakes  him at 7.15am. He
 lives  outside  the  village so he has
 two  buses to catch. David  comes from
 Edenhall  by car. We  start  school at
 9.00 am. We  have  a  wide  range  of 
 lessons to do. In the morning we some-
 times  do  maths from  our  textbooks,
 other days we  do topic  maths  which 
 extends  textbook  work. After  break 
 we do  language work which can include
 English  exercises , essays or our own
 opinion work. Topic and  project  work
 includes history,science,geography,art
 and  craft. We  are  just  finishing a
 particularly interesting project about
 natural  resources .We discussed wind,
 sun and  water  power.We  made  models
 using  meccano,  lego and old  plastic
 bottles. Our  project has taken  us on
 to  plastic and  fibres. We can  go to
 Penrith  pool once  a week and  nearly
 every one can swim.                   </content>
