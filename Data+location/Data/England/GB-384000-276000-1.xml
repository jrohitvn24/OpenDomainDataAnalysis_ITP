		<content>{Detached Houses.                      
 My house is made of plywood and brick.
 It has wood round the windows and     
 doors and sixteen windows. Of these   
 there are four at the front, two at   
 each side and eight at the back. The  
 colour of the door and the garage is  
 yellow. The rest of the paintwork is  
 white. We have three chimneys and a   
 television aerial. All the windows are
 double glazed and we have a patio     
 door.The garage is attached to the    
 house. Behind and above it we have    
 built an extension which has made the 
 kitchen bigger and added a shower     
 room.                                 
 My house is detached. It is made of   
 bricks, wood and pebble dash. It is   
 very new. There are six rooms upstairs
 and three downstairs.
