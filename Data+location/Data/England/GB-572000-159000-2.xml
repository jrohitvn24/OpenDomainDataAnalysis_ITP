		<title>02LAND USE AROUND AYLESFORD</title>
		<content> Our area is on the north side of the  
 geological structure of the Weald.It  
 includes three different rock         
 types.The northern edge of the        
 Folkestone sand is exposed along the  
 south edge of the block.This is mostly
 covered with woodland but building    
 sand is extracted from a large area   
 adjacent to Aylesford.Gault Clay      
 extends over the greater part of the  
 block and provides the subsoil for    
 most of the agricultural land.Chalk   
 outcrops in the northeast corner of   
 the block producing high ground       
 coveredin woodlands.A group of        
 children from St Peters recorded on a 
 map the crops of each field.Commonest 
 crops are:wheat/barley,fruit,hops.The 
 waste ground is mostly disused chalk  
 and clay pits.The grazing mainly feeds
 sheep,with some horses,beef cattle and
 goats.                                </content>
