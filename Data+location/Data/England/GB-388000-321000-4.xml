		<title>04 Killer Virus in Stafford.</title>
		<content>         The Legionnaires disease      
started in late April 1985.What caused 
the outbreak is still uncertain.It     
could have been a water cooling tower  
or a ventilation fan in the District   
Hospital.Scientists tests point to the 
water supply.The name of the bacteria  
is Legionella Pneumophila.             
         The biggest proportion of the 
people who died were elderly.There were
about 200 suspected cases.By May 31st, 
39 people had died.                    
         The symptoms are difficulty   
with breathing,feeling weak and other  
'flu' symptoms.The patients were helped
to breathe using a ventilator machine  
and treated for other 'flu' symptoms.  
It isn't contagious and as yet there is
no cure.At the moment this disease     
cannot be prevented.                   
         Some people avoided the       
Hospital and area during the outbreak. </content>
