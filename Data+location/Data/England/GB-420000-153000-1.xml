		<title>01Collingbourne Kingston Area</title>
		<content> The four mile by three mile area of   
 this report consists of two villages  
 seperated by farmland.                
 The village of Collingbourne Kingston 
 lies to the north east of the area and
 was orignally known as Collingbourne  
 Kingstone. This village was mentioned 
 in the first Domesday Book.           
 The village of Everleigh lies to the  
 south west of Collingbourne Kingston  
 some three miles away. There have been
 eleven births in Everleigh during the 
 last twelve months which shows that   
 although only a small village, like   
 that of Collingbourne Kingston, it is 
 regenerating.                         
 The farmland between the villages     
 covers most aspects of farming,       
 including a 'Pig Village', which is a 
 large number of mobile stys which are 
 moved from field to field as required.
