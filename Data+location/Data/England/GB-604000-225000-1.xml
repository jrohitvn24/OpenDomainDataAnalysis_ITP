		<title>01THE ELMSTEAD AREA</title>
		<content>    Our area covers{Elmstead,Burnt     
{Heath,Crockleford Heath}and parts of  
{Gt.Bromley}and{Ardleigh.}It is        
 predominantly a{farming}area,but      
 unusually for this part of{Essex,}it  
 is not only{arable,}there are{orchards
 and{nurseries;}because of this many   
{hedges}remain and the area is rich in 
{woodland.}Houses are scattered, apart 
 from the dwellings in{Burnt Heath}-   
 these are mainly  occupied by retired 
 people or commuters. The houses are   
 not modern, some are old,but many have
 undergone alterations, e.g.extensions 
 and windows.There are few amenities,  
 there is no mains drainage or gas. The
{New By-Pass}has had a considerable    
 effect on the farms as a number have  
 been divided into 2,and one has been  
 divided into 4. Bridges have been     
 built to facilitate the moving of     
 agricultural machinery.               </content>
