{Trout,}a variety which grow very      
 rapidly and are thought by many to be 
 a finer flavour table trout. They are 
 amenable to living in the relatively  
 confined conditions of the fish tank, 
 they are also disease free, another   
 important factor in fish farming.     
 Eleven people work at the Trout Farm  
 on a shift rota for someone must be   
 there seven days a week to feed the   
 trout.Most of the trout are bred at   
 the farm though a proportion are      
 raised at the hatchery at the         
{Bishopstrow Trout Farm.}The fish are  
 fed on pellets graded according to    
 their size, small fry are fed several 
 times a day, larger trout twice a day.
 The largest trout they have raised is 
 12lbs but the preferred size for      
 smoking is 5lbs. The most popular size
 for the table is 3/4lb.               </content>
