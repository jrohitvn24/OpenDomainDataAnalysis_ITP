		<title>13BRITISH RAIL, CREWE WORKS</title>
		<content> Crewe works has an area of 90 acres   
 and you can fit 100 locomotives in    
 there at one time. 3,991 men and 138  
 women are employed at the works. Some 
 workshops work 1 shift, some work two 
 and some 3 shifts. The loco test area 
 works three shifts because the locos  
 sometimes go non-stop for over 24     
 hours. The youngest worker is 16 and  
 the oldest is 64 years old. The       
 longest length of service is 49 years.
 In the last year there were 53        
 accidents but none of them was        
 serious. In Crewe works the wages     
 range from Â£32 for a new apprentice,  
 to over Â£20,000. The works will do any
 engineering, from mending electric    
 motors to casting anchors for oil     
 rigs.
