		<title>08Housing in the Wolfords</title>
		<content> In the Todenham area of the block and 
 Great Wolford the majority of the     
 houses are owner occupied, with a     
 small number being second homes only  
 used at weekends. Little Wolford and  
 Todenham have a handful of tied       
 cottages nearly all for agricultural  
 workers. There are three cottages in  
 Great Wolford let for Holiday visitors
 and one in Little Wolford. The three  
 villages have a number of council     
 owned houses and bungalows, 10 in     
 Todenham, 13 in Great Wolford and 8 in
 Little Wolford. Little Wolford is     
 unusual in having a large proportion  
 of its houses privately rented: in    
 fact only about 14 are owner occupied 
 while 8 belong to the council and 22  
 are either tenanted or tied cottages  
 and houses, the majority of these     
 belonging to one estate.
