      Camping sites take up a large    
 part of the landscape, and perhaps the
 most popular is the Bethesda          
 Camping and Caravan park.             
      They are busiest in the Summer,  
 when they have on average 1000 people,
 80% of whom, return from the previous 
 year. They bring there own caravans   
 and tents. On average they spend one  
 week there. There are 12 acres of     
 camping land, 30 altogether.          
{CORNISH COLISEUM                      
{    }The Cornish Coliseum at Carlyon  
 Bay, near St. Austell is the centre of
 Cornish entertainment.                
      The largest facilities are the   
 two beaches, although not the most    
 popular. That honour belongs to the   
 actual coliseum, where the concerts   
 and shows are staged.
