		<title>15Life today in Coddenham Area</title>
		<content> Home life in the villages of Coddenham
 and Hemingstone is probably much more 
 comfortable in the 1980's than even   
 only 30 years ago; until then there   
 was no main drainage. Electricity is  
 now widely available enabling most    
 people to have televisions, washing   
 machines, freezers and refrigerators. 
 Many homes have videos and Hi-Fi's and
 some a computer. Relative income      
 levels are much higher than in earlier
 years. Most families have a car and   
 with an adequate bus service, people  
 living here nowadays are able to enjoy
 a much fuller life. Inside homes in   
 this area life goes on in much the    
 same way as urban areas. Most people  
 now live in the country because they  
 choose to do so; in earlier years they
 had no choice as they depended on     
 agriculture for their living. Many    
 homes have pets &amp; a few keep chickens.</content>
