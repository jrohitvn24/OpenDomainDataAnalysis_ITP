		<content> With a population of approximately    
 1000 Temple Cloud is the largest      
 centre of population.It grew as a     
 linear village along the Bristol-Wells
 road.In 1901 the population of the    
 parish was 403,having fallen from 643 
 in 1841.During the last 20 years there
 has been Local Authority and private  
 housing development,accomodating      
 Bristol overspill and commuter        
 families.Temple Cloud is identified as
 a 'centre for growth' in the County   
 Structure Plan,so further growth is   
 anticipated.                          
 The oldest building in the parish is  
 Cameley church,while Cameley mill     
 dates from the seventeenth            
 century.Many houses are made of the   
 locally quarried Temple Stone.1985 saw
 the opening of the village hall.Both  
 the village pub and St. Barnabas'     
 Church,in Temple, are twentieth cent. </content>
