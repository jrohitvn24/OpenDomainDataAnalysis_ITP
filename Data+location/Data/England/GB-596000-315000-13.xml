		<title>13MY HOME AND GARDEN</title>
		<content> I live in a house on Tavern Close,    
 Beetley.It is a new housing estate.We 
 moved into our house in 1980 and while
 we have been living there we have had 
 two extensions built.One was a kitchen
 because our old kitchen was too small,
 so we changed it into a dining room.  
 The other extension was a porch over  
 our front door.                       
 Our house has 4 bedrooms,lounge,dining
 room,kitchen,bathroom,2 toilets ,hall 
 and a porch.                          
 We have a 1 acre garden with a big    
 pond at the bottom.                   
 My father runs a chain of 4 local     
 shops and commutes regularly to London
 for purchasing.My mother runs a beauty
 parlour on the first floor of the     
 Dereham shop.                         
 I have one younger sister who is at   
 school with me.
