		<title>16The Community Tutor</title>
		<content> The Community Tutor considers         
 her main function in the local        
 community is to find out what people  
 want like an institute or club of some
 sort.She also tries to solve their    
 problems and to help them.A typical   
 day for her would be rather hectic.She
 said she would tell us about today as 
 her typical day.First of all she came 
 to our school to tell us about her job
 as a Community Tutor,then she would   
 go to her office at Cherry Hinton     
 Community School,Cambridge.She would  
 write a few letters to invite anybody 
 who would be interested to help in the
 Cherry Hinton Festival.She will also  
 get some telephone calls about the    
 same thing.People are most likely to  
 drop in for all different reasons.Then
 she will go to a meeting in the       
 evening about community matters.
