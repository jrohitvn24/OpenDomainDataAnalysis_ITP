		<content> In our area we have an army head-     
 quarters. Not many people know what it
 is there for. When we sent out our    
 survey only two people said{Western   
{District H.Q.}When we asked forces    
 personel where they worked they       
 responded with only one answer, {     
{Copthorne Barracks.}One person said   
 that they had worked for the army and 
 the R.A.F. Most people started working
 for the forces between the ages of 18 
 and 22, and most are able to see their
 family daily. We were surprised that  
 not many people were aware of the army
 presence especially as there is a     
{Territorial Army Headquarters}close to
{Coleham School}as well. In addition   
 the{Light Infantry}have been in       
 Shrewsbury at{Copthorne}for over 100  
 years. Soon the infantry is to leave  
 and{Copthorne Barracks}is to house the
{Western District Headquarters.        </content>
