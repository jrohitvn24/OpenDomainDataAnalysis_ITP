		<title>14SMEATHARPE - LOCAL ISSUES</title>
		<content> Smeatharpe Village School was closed  
 amid protest from parents.  The child-
 ren were then transported the 3 miles 
 to Upottery Primary School by free    
 minibus.  In 1984 the local education 
 authority decided that children over  
 the age of 8 would have to pay. It is 
 now Â£2O per child per term.  Parents  
 feel this is blackmail as the road is 
 too dangerous to walk.  It is unlit,  
 has no pavement, is sparsely populated
 and carries cars and heavy lorries.   
 In September, l985 the staff at       
 Upottery School will be reduced from  
 4 to 3 full-time teachers, due to     
 falling rolls. It is a constant       
 source of concern that this reduction 
 in children will continue so that the 
 teaching staff will again be cut or   
 that the school will eventually close 
 altogether.-
