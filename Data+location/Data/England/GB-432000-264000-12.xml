		<title>12THE JOB OF A HOUSING ADVISOR</title>
		<content>   My father, Roger Grenville, works at
 the housing advice centre at Bath     
 Place. He has been working there for  
 nearly six years. His job entails     
 helping people to find somewhere to   
 live when they move into the area and 
 helping famlies who are in danger of  
 eviction by helping them to find ways 
 of clearing their debts. He also      
 advises people who believe that they  
 are paying too high a rent on rented  
 property. He spends the majority of   
 his time telling people their legal   
 rights and helping them to get them!  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
