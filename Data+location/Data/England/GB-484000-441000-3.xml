		<content>      The railway lines were closed in 
 the l960s and the nearest mainline    
 station is at Brough (l2 miles).      
 Public Transport is provided by East  
 Yorkshire Motor Services Ltd., who run
 scheduled services from Hull via      
 Market Weighton and Shiptonthorpe, to 
 York and Leeds.  There is a weekday   
 service of 10 buses a day in each     
 direction with a reduced service on   
 Sundays.  A local coach firm provides 
 tours and excursions to places of     
 interest in the summer, and, together 
 with a newer firm, have a number of   
 coaches and mini buses available for  
 contract work and private hire.       
      The road haulage industry is well
 represented in the area, mainly       
 providing bulk transporters and cattle
 trucks.
