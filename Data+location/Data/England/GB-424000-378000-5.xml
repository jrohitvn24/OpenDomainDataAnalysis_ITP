		<title>05The Longshaw Estate</title>
		<content> The Longshaw Estate is now owned by   
 the National Trust and covers some    
 1500 acres. From the Grindleford to   
 Fox House road can be seen the dark   
 and imposing Longshaw Lodge and its   
 Chapel. The Lodge now houses private  
 apartments, and was once a hunting    
 lodge for the Dukes of Rutland. The   
 public footpath passes close to the   
 front of the Lodge and between this   
 and the small gatehouse are the       
 welcoming cafe, giftshop and          
 Information Centre which are very     
 popular with locals and tourists      
 alike, particularly with weekend      
 walkers, as the home made snacks are  
 to be recommended. Much of the land is
 used for sheep grazing and comprises  
 streams, grassland, moorland and      
 woods.
