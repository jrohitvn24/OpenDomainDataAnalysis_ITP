		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION- HAMPTON</title>
		<content> This Domesday Block situated at the   
 extreme west of Herne Bay is over 95% 
 sea with only a tiny portion of land  
 in one corner. It is part of the area 
 known as Hampton. The land rises quite
 steeply from the sea and is mainly    
 used for housing with fine views over 
 the Thames Estuary and towards the    
 Isle of Sheppey. The lower land by the
 sea contains a grassed recreation area
 with a boating pool and some club     
 houses. However although most of this 
 area is now sea it should be noted    
 that erosion, mainly caused during the
 last hundred years has meant that the 
 remains of several old streets and    
 houses now lie beneath the waters. At 
 low tide blocks of the old sea wall   
 rise out of the mud a hundred yards   
 from the present wall. Some houses now
 1/4 mile inland are built of material 
 from houses threatened by the sea.    </content>
