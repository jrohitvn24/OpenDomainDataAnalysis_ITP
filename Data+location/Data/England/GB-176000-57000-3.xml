		<title>03LOCAL HISTORY - THE CHURCH</title>
		<content>                                       
 The ancient church consists of a      
 chancel, nave and 4 bays with Early   
 English and Perpendicular features.   
 The font and pulpit are of unusual    
 design being made of old bench ends.  
 Much of the church was destroyed by   
 lightning in l848 and was rebuilt     
 in l852. The spire, repaired again in 
 l980 and almost unique amid Cornwall's
 square towers, is an important        
 navigational reference point used by  
 both Trinity House and the RAF as well
 as fishermen. The spire stands 3OO ft.
 above sea-level and houses 3 bells.   
 In l980 a fine 'Father' Willis pipe   
 organ was installed. This was formerly
 built for the library at Lanhydrock   
 House near Bodmin.
