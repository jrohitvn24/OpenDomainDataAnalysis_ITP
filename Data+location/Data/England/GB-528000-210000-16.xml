		<title>16The Hertingfordbury Project</title>
		<content> Hertingfordbury School has been one   
 school amongst six taking part in a   
 Hertfordshire Project investigating   
 the use of microcomputers in Primary  
 Schools. The Project, known as The    
 Hertingfordbury Project, was financed 
 jointly by Herts County Council and   
 The Trustees of The Cowper Foundation 
 (who are also the Trustees of         
 Hertingfordbury JMI School). It was   
 inaugurated in January 1984 and was   
 completed in December 1985. The main  
 purpose of the Project was to look at 
 the ways in which children (and       
 teachers) use microcomputers for the  
 purposes of handling information in   
 the Primary School. The main family of
 programs used were the QUEST family,  
 developed by The Advisory Unit for    
 Computer Based Education.
