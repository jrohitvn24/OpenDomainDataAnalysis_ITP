		<content>  I decided to climb a treee.It was    
 easy to climb the elm tree because it 
 has nails in.I have carved my name in 
 the tree.I looked at my watch,it was 5
 o'clock;When I had my tea I watched   
 television.Then it was time to go to  
 bed.                                  
    On a school day I get up at quarter
 to eight and get all my school things 
 ready.After I had got all my school   
 things ready,I had my breakfast,then  
 it was time to go to school.On Tuesday
 morning I did my Spellaway then our   
 teacher wrote our spellings on the    
 blackboard for us to copy.Then it was 
 dinnertime.We normally have a cooked  
 dinner and a pudding to follow.We     
 sometimes have water to drink.After   
 lunch we have a big playtime.After    
 playtime we have History with Mrs.    
 Fraser then it is play again.After    
 that we just carry on with our history</content>
