 valley. It is only really noticeable  
 from Rockside, a road leading upwards 
 on the southern side of the valley.   
                                       
 Hoylands, a small umbrella factory in

 and employs     people, includiong    
 local people who do some assembly

 Originally there was a number of water
 powered corn mills along the river,   
 hence the name Millhouse. Now there is
 only one firm, Goldthorpes, still in  
 operation. Goldthorpes have extended  
 their business from their original    
 site at Bullhouse, Millhouse, where   
 they manufacture animal feedstuffs.   
 Broadbents haulage company is based in
 Millhouse.                            </content>
