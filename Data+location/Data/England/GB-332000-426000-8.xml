		<title>08St Annes - Tourist Interview</title>
		<content>     People staying in hotels thought  
 them good value in view of good food  
 and entertainment.One family in       
 holiday flats thought them expensive, 
 another in a Blackpool flat was       
 pleased.Caravans were also seen as    
 good value.There was plenty for       
 children to do it was thought: parks, 
 the beach,miniature- railway,         
 and trampolines.But teenagers were    
 more difficult to accommodate.The     
 visitors thought the locals to be     
 friendly and helpful although one     
 found them 'rather off hand'.People   
 found drinks to be more expensive,    
 otherwise things were similar in      
 price. Only one person would not come 
 again,all the others enjoyed their    
 holiday.Most people  compared St Annes
 favourably with other holiday resorts,
 in Britain as being more relaxed,not  
 brash 'just right for us'.            </content>
