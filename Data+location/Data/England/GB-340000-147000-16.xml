		<title>16LOCAL OPINIONS IN WEDMORE</title>
		<content>   From our questionaire results we    
 have found out that the majority of   
 people in Wedmore like the{peace}of   
 the village and the{countryside. }    
   Most people object to the traffic   
 which travels through the village, if 
 it is a big lorry it can be very      
 dangerous going around tight corners. 
 They also do not want double yellow   
 lines or a one way system. They want a
{car park}preferably by the vicarage,  
 near the shops.                       
   Villagers also like being near main 
{tourist attractions}and big towns.    
 Hardly anyone wants Wedmore to get    
 bigger, with new housing estates and  
 to become a busy town.                
   Older residents used not to regard  
 anyone who came to live in the village
 as a{"local"}until they had served    
 twenty years!
