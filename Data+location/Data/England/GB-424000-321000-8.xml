		<title>08St Peter's Bridge Carnival</title>
		<content>     After many years Burton is to have
a second river crossing.   The old     
Trent Bridge has been unable to cope   
with the peak-time traffic for a very  
long time, so 1985 is an important year
for the town.                          
     To celebrate the occasion a       
carnival was held on the bridge before 
it was actually opened to traffic.     
     There was a procession of over    
forty floats, and an aeroplane (BAC    
111) flew over carrying people who had 
paid to see the carnival from the air. 
There were some stalls selling         
souvenirs and anyone who paid a pound  
was presented with a certificate to    
commemorate the occasion.   Races were 
held over the bridge and there were    
other competitions.   It was an        
interesting and exciting day, spoiled  
only by the rain which began to pour   
down half way through the afternoon.   </content>
