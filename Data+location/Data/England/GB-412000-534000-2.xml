		<title>02Life on Low Mown Meadows.</title>
		<content> Low Mown Meadows is a quiet housing   
 estate.There are five shops but two   
 are vacant at the moment.One is a fish
 and chip shop, one is an off license  
 and the other is a hair-dressers.If we
 want anything we have to go to the    
 supermarket.There are a lot of houses 
 in Low Mown Meadows,most are council  
 houses.Some are terraced,some are     
 semi-detatched and a few are          
 bungalows.My house has a dining room, 
 sitting room, kitchen, four bedrooms  
 and a bathroom. There are few leisure 
 facilities on our estate except for   
 Hartside school which is also a       
 Community centre.
