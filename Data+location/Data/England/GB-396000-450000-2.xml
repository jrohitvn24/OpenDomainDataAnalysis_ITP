		<title>02DAY IN THE LIFE OF J.PICKLES</title>
		<content>    When I'm woken up in the morning by
 my super-sonic clock radio, I reach   
 down to my{record player,}and put on a
 record by Michael Jackson. Next my    
 uniform! Then I scramble an egg in the
{Microwave,}and put on the coffee      
 maker. Kirsten calls for me. We walk  
 to the bus stop. I have a Boring day  
 at school and I can't wait for the    
 bell. When it does go, I go to home   
 and put on my jeans, jumper, and coat,
 and go for Kirsten.                   
    Then we walk to the Summer seat, or
 sit by the river. At 7.pm we go to the
{youth club.}We usually sit behind the 
{disco unit,}or have a game of{pool.}I 
 go home at 9.30pm, up the stairs at   
 10.00pm, and watch{television}in bed. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
