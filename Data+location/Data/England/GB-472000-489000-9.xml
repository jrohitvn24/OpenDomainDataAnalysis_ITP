		<content>{Tourism}affects all who live here,    
 though not necessarily by choice.     
 There is either a positive,           
 antagonistic or indifferent approach  
 by the residents. Those with a        
 positive approach recognise the       
 benifits tourism brings &amp; that it is  
 becoming an important part of the     
 rural economy. Some may be upset by   
 the changes in their normally tranquil
 lifestyle as during the summer months 
 the small country lanes become busy.  
 However,the underlying attitude is a  
 willingness to share with others what 
 they themselves enjoy all the year    
 round. The area is a good centre for  
 visitors to explore the North Yorks   
 moors &amp; coast. The scenery is varied  
 with hills,woods,fields &amp; moorland.   
 Stone built farms &amp; cottages blend    
 into the landscape which changes with 
 the seasons.                          </content>
