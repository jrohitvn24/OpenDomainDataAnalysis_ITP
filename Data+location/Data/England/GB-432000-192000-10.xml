		<content> One lady has lived in the mill in     
Stanford for 44 years. The mill was    
powered by water and was used for      
grinding corn. She has loved dogs all  
her life and has been training them for
7 years. She enjoys living in the      
village.                               
 One man living near the school was a  
policeman for 30 years. He gained two  
awards :- long service and good        
conduct. One crime he remembers was    
people stealing clothes in World War   
Two because clothing was rationed. He  
said that he would like to see more    
sport in the village.                  
 The Vicar lives in a new vicarage in  
Stanford but is in charge of several   
other parishes as well. His job        
includes leading services, Baptism and 
Christenings, confirmation, weddings,  
funerals, visiting the sick and        
helping people to be better Christians.</content>
