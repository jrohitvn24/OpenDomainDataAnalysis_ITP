 Most of the houses of Rowhedge are of 
 brick and most are over 50 years old. 
 One of the special features of some   
 houses is the{sail loft or boat store 
 still attached to them, and which were
 used to store gear from the fishing   
 smacks and racing yachts.             
      There are approx. 720 houses in  
 the village, 430 privately owned and  
 240 Council houses.  The rest are     
 rented privately or part of housing   
 association schemes.  There are no    
 plans at present to expand the        
 village.  In Fingringhoe most of the  
 housing is situated around the High   
 Park Corner.  A number are old,       
 including Thornfleet.  In the last 10 
 years a new estate has been developed 
 along Frere Way and the development   
 has caused this part of the village
