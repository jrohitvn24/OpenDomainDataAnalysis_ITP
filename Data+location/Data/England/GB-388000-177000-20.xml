{Commission.}There is a mixture of     
 evergreen and deciduous trees. There  
 is a{Roman Villa}there. In Stanton    
 Park, not far from the Roman Villa is 
 a{Black Pond,}it is called Black Pond 
 because there was a murder there.     
 There were two sailors on leave, one  
 was William Jacques, the other was    
 George Hartford. William Jacques spent
 all his Â£28, he spent it at the Dragon
 Inn at Malmesbury. Hartford followed  
 Jacques to Hullavington pub. When they
 were on their way back to Chippenham  
 they went through Stanton Park. When  
 they got near to the pool, Jacques    
{murdered}Hartford by hitting him on   
 the head with a hedge stake, he left  
 him by the pool and took his money. He
 was later caught and hung in          
 Hullavington.
