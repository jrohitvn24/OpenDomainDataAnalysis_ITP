		<title>20RETIREMENT IN BUDE</title>
		<content> 75% of retired people tend to join {  
{The Ever-Green Club}which organises   
 day trips.It is run by {Flexbury      
{Methodist Church}and is run by local  
 people of similar age.Many retired    
 people feel that there should be      
 public transport because it is too far
 to walk to Bude.Shopping in winter is 
 a problem and people have to walk to  
 the village store where prices are    
 higher.The lane to the village is     
 narrow and lacks a pavement.          
    Other problems arise from the lack 
 of local hospital facilities.Although 
 there is a cottage hospital at        
{Stratton,}most people have to receive 
 treatment at{Plymouth}or{Barnstable. }
 Hospital cars are provided by the{    
{health authorities,}but visiting for  
 older people is very difficult.       
                                       
                                       </content>
