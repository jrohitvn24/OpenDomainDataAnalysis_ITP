		<title>09A BARNARD CASTLE PUBLICAN</title>
		<content> My name is Emma Dobson,I am 10 years  
 old.My parents run a public house in  
 Barnard Castle called the Cricketers  
 Arms.We have the public bar and lounge
 where meals are served and my mam does
 the cooking.Friday nights and         
 Saturdays are the busiest times.The   
 men like Strongarm Ale and the ladies 
 drink lager, martini or wine.For      
 entertainment we have a Juke Box,a one
 armed bandit ,dart board and dominoes.
 Our darts and dominoes teams play     
 other pub teams.Our customers are     
 mostly local people of all ages and   
 anyone causing trouble is barred,but  
 this does not often happen.Mam and Dad
 have one day off a week and two weeks 
 holiday a year.A friend comes in to   
 run the pub for us then.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
