		<content>     The area lies in{BRECKLAND}which  
 is a{lowland area}with distinctive    
 and individual characteristics.       
                                       
     It is a{low plateau between 100   
{and 200 feet above sea level.}The     
 sub-soil is a mix of chalk, gravel,   
 sand, loam and chalky boulder clay,   
 but the area is unified by sand       
 covering these deposits. Often the    
 sand is only a few inches in depth,   
 but in some places it is several feet.
                                       
     The{sandy soil}forms a perfect    
 filter bed absorbing water with great 
 rapidity, and even during the heaviest
 showers pools of water are not formed 
 on the surface.{The rainfall is low   
 and the bulk falls in the summer, so  
 much is lost by evaporation.
