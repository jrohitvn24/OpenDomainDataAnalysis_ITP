		<content>      The area covered by reference    
 number 04040417 is on the boundary of 
 Yorkshire and Lancashire, but is in   
 West Yorkshire. The area is in a Green
 Belt and is known locally as the Black
 Brook Valley. It is a very hilly area 
 close to the M62.                     
      This survey was compiled by      
 Bowling Green School. As the area is  
 rural and there are few bus routes we 
 explored on foot or by bike. We       
 divided our area into 12 sections and 
 took a small group of children to each
 one. We gave each section a grid      
 reference and name:-{Ripponden Bank   
{0419,Barkisland 0519,Branch Road 0619 
{Stainland 0719, Ringstone Edge        
{0418,Krumlin 0518,Stainland Dean      
{0618,Sowood 0718, Withens End         
{0417,Scammonden Road 0517,Broom Hill  
{0617,Marsden Gate 0717. }
