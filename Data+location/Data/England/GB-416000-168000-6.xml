		<title>06THE MARLBOROUGH MOP FAIR</title>
		<content> The Mop Fair is in an unusual place - 
 it is in the middle of the High       
 Street, which is closed except to     
 fire engines, for the day. It is held 
 on two Saturdays nearest to October   
 10th. It is called "The Mop" because  
 it used to be a hiring fair about 150 
 years ago, and people could come and  
 choose new servants, who carried the  
 tools of their trade (e.g. a mop).    
                                       
 All the rides and attractions of the  
 fair are put up all through Friday,   
 ready for Saturday. The fair is       
 very noisy and carries on well into   
 Saturday night.  By magic, everything 
 is cleared away in a couple of hours  
 early on Sunday morning and by        
 breakfast the fair has gone.
