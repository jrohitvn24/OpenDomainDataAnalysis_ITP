		<title>03CHANGES IN KILLAMARSH TOWN.</title>
		<content> Killamarsh is a small village in north
 Derbyshire.It has grown in size       
 over the last 50 years.The population 
 has risen from 5,000 in 1935 to 11,000
 in 1985. This was partly caused by the
 new housing estates.Over the past 50  
 years there have been many changes in 
 work.In 1935 almost all men used to   
 be miners but now they have many      
 different jobs, in and out of the     
 village. Many women have jobs now too 
 instead of being mainly housewives.   
 Transport has changed as well.In 1935 
 only rich people had cars but nowadays
 almost everyone has a car or even     
 two.1935 shopping facilities were poor
 but now there are two supermarkets and
 many small shops.Rother Valley Park   
 was built nearby,providing various    
 water sports.There are also better    
 recreation grounds with new playing   
 fields,parks and the leisure centre.  </content>
