 The sector reflects the landscape     
 of the western outskirts of           
 Scunthorpe.The western edge of the    
 sector runs along the bank of the     
 River Trent and then the sector runs  
 in a north easterly direction to      
 Scunthorpe.At first we have flat      
 agricultural land but as the sector   
 reaches Scunthorpe the land rises up  
 a ridge.Here the ridge is known as    
 Atkinsons Warren.It begins as a large 
 area of deciduous woodland but as the 
 ridge rises this is replaced by sandy 
 heathland.At the top of the ridge is  
 another area of woodland but this is  
 mainly composed of coniferous trees.
