      St.Chad to whom the church is    
 dedicated was a great figure in the   
 early English Church. He died in 672  
 and his feast day is kept on 2nd      
 March.There is a stained glass window 
 at nearby{Ladbroke}depicting Chad.    
      The church stands to the north of
 the village in a high position,which  
 suggests that before Christianity came
 to Britain it may have been a pagan   
 place of worship.                     
      The church dates back to the 12th
 century and is made of local{Edge Hill
 and{Hornton}stone.The Saxon or Norman 
 font is still used.The first recorded 
 vicar of the church,in 1327, is Hugo  
 Leyng.A memorial slab to{Walter Savage
{Landor}is in the south aisle and the  
 east chancel window is dedicated to   
 Frances Eliza,wife of Charles Kingsley</content>
