		<title>15GARDEN FETE</title>
		<content>     Ever since the school was built in
 1951, we have had a garden fete.      
     The P.T.A hold the garden fete on 
 the first Saturday in June.           
     The day before, Mr Moxon, the     
 headmaster hands out magic tickets to 
 the people who have sold the most     
 tickets,for the prize draw and the    
 most programmes, so they can have a go
 on everything.                        
     Every year we have a different    
 theme, this year it was music.        
     This year, we had the school      
 orchestra, the Highland Pipers,the    
 Loughborough Town band,and the        
 Boys Brigade band.                    
     In the arena we had maypole       
 dancing,the high jump, and other      
 events.
