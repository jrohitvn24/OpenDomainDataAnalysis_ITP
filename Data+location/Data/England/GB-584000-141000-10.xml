		<title>10Smarden West - Buildings</title>
		<content> There are many interesting buildings  
 in this section. Old farm houses,     
 weatherboard cottages clustered round 
 the churchyard, converted oast houses 
 and barns. Two of the most outstanding
 are Hartnup House, a picturesque 17th 
 century building, with the Church     
 making a perfect backcloth, built by a
 physician; and the Cloth Hall, built  
 by the church c.1420 as a farmhouse.  
 In 1450 a wool merchant converted it  
 to a residence cum warehouse and it   
 has since been used as a farmhouse,   
 army quarters in the 1938-45 war and  
 then, after restoration in the 1940s, 
 a private residence. By contrast the  
 Oaks, a row of council houses built in
 the 1930-40s, is uninspiring, but has 
 provided homes for people needing     
 cheap rented houses and so helped to  
 keep the village alive.
