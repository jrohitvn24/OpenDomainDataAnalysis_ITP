		<content> Mrs Prideaux has lived in Bridport for
 fourteen years.She started the kennels
 she now owns in 1979.Police from five 
 different police stations bring their 
 stray dogs to Mrs Prideaux. They are  
 Portland,Weymouth,Lyme,Beaminster     
 and Bridport.Before bringing the stray
 dogs to Mrs Prideaux the police write 
 down a complete description of the dog
 so that if anybody came in claiming a 
 dog they would know all the           
 information about the dog.The first   
 thing that Mrs Prideaux does when she 
 gets a stray dog is give it a full    
 medical check up and keep it away     
 from other dogs.She feeds her dogs on 
 a complete dogfood 'Omega'.When she   
 gets a stray dog she treats it with   
 extra loving care and it will trust   
 her.The police only pay for it to be  
 kept at Mrs Prideaux for one week then
 Mrs Prideaux finds homes for them.    </content>
