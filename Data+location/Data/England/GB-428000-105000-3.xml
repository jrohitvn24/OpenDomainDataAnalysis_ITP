		<title>03Stock Breeding-Waverley Farm</title>
		<content>    This farm specialises in breeding  
 dairy cattle.   The cows generally    
 produce 1 calf p.a.   There is a 50%  
 rate of male and female.   65 heffers 
 are kept, 4 young bulls, 2 stock bulls
 for serving and 155 breeding cows.    
{ Artificial Insemination}is the main  
 method of reproduction used.   Bulls  
 are needed to serve cows which cannot 
 accept this form.   The success rate  
 for A.I. is 62%.   The semen used is  
 kept in tanks of liquid nitrogen and  
 has lasted 38 yrs. and has still been 
 successful.   Embryos are stored along
 with these and have lasted            
 successfully for 28 yrs.   An average 
 number of 150 young calves are        
 produced p.a.                         
  The remainder of the cattle produced 
 are sold at Salisbury market for beef,
 each fetching up to Â£132, depending on
 the quality of the calf.              </content>
