		<title>01General Survey</title>
		<content>    This is an area of lowland, drained
 by the little River Leadon and a few  
 minor brooks, with Limbury Hill on the
 southern edge of the area the only    
 eminence, rising to some 40 metres    
 only. It is part of the parishes of   
{Upleadon}and{Corse,}containing both   
 those parish churches, but the        
 villages they serve are outside the   
 survey area, so apart from an         
 extension of Hartbury in the south-   
 east corner and some development along
 the A417 this is a district of        
 scattered farms and other homes.      
    A questionaire delivered in the    
 area produced 33 returns, representing
 under 30% of the area's residences.   
    Information gained from this       
 limited sample showed the following   
 facts:- {16 adults were born locally  
 while{38 have moved into the area     
 within the last 20 years.             </content>
