		<title>04My Day-Paul Sanderson Age 10</title>
		<content> I got up at 7:25. My breakfast was    
 toast and Marmite. I washed and       
 dressed. My Mum drove me one and a    
 half miles to catch the school bus. At
 9:00 we had Assembly, then Scripture. 
 Then we made house labels for Sports  
 Day. At 10:20 we did Maths. After 15  
 minutes play outside we did English.  
 At 11:55 we went by coach to Deeping  
 Leisure Centre for our swimming       
 lesson. At 13:30 we returned and ate  
 our packed lunches. After a short     
 playtime we had music - practicing    
 recorders and songs, to perform to the
 Senior Citizens. At 15:00 we worked on
 our Water Project. At 15:30 the bus   
 came. My Mum met me in our Ford Capri 
 car. I watched ITV until tea time. At 
 18:00 I went for 2 hours swimming     
 training. When I got home I watched TV
 until 21:45, bed time.
