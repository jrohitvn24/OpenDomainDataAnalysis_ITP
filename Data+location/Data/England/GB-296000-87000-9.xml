		<title>09TOPSHAM SCHOOL POND</title>
		<content> In our science lessons we are finding 
 out about our school pond. It measures
 2 metres by 3 metres 30 cm and is     
 becoming rather overgrown. There are  
 irises in the middle and other types  
 of reeds around them. There are lots  
 of plants and creatures in our pond,  
 for example pond skaters, a baby newt 
 and some water boatmen. Around the    
 pond there are beatles. We did have   
 some goldfish but we have not seen    
 them for quite some time now. We do   
 not know if they are alive or not and 
 just hiding in the reeds. In our      
 science lessons we often go to the    
 school pond to find insects and study 
 them, but we always put them back     
 afterwards.
