 DOWNHILL RESERVOIR LOCATION NANNY COW 
 HILL                                  
 This original reservoir was in a state
 of bad repair and midway through 1984 
 Mowlem a London-based firm of Civil   
 Engineers were awarded a contract to  
 repair and enlarge the existing       
 reservoir.  Four children from St.    
 John Bosco R.C. School arranged an    
 interview with the site manager who   
 very kindly explained to them the     
 purpose of Mowlem's operation and the 
 benefits the local community might    
 receive. This is to enable the        
 reservoir to cater for the area in the
 1990's.
