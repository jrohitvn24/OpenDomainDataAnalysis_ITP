		<content>On Friday 28th June 1985 plans were    
released in the local press of a       
solution to the problems of the A5 in  
the form of a spine road running       
parallel to the A5 from Wilnecote to   
Mile Oak. This idea was suggested 20   
years ago but has been held up by a    
disagreement between the County Council
and the Department of Transport as to  
who should be responsible for the bill.
Local reaction to the scheme is        
generally mixed. Many people are       
pleased and feel that the spine road   
will help to solve many problems. Some 
are in favour of the idea but question 
the design of the road. One shopowner  
on the A5 was completely taken back    
when asked her views on the scheme-it  
was the first she had heard anything   
about it!
