 Our area is mainly agricultural.It    
 is a shallow valley bounded by hills  
 rising to almost 1000 feet to the     
 south and west.{Bishops Castle}is the 
 main centre of population(approx      
 1700).                                
 It is a small market town set on a    
 hill in the SW corner of the block.   
   There was a{Norman castle}but all   
 that remains is part of the wall which
 is in a public park (The Castle Site) 
 next to the Bowling Green,which is    
 claimed to be the second oldest in the
 country.                              
   The main street runs down from the  
 castle to the church.                 
   The tower is the oldest part of the 
 church.It was built in Norman times.  
 The rest of the church was burnt but  
 was rebuilt in 1860.
