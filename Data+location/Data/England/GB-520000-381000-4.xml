		<title>04BENNIWORTH VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Benniworth is not a  very big         
 village,                              
 and has not many commercial or public 
 properties,in fact there are only     
 thirteen commercial  properties most  
 of which do not sell direct.There are 
 five public and community services,a  
 church down Church Lane,down Main Road
 there is a Post Box and a Telephone   
 Box.Along North Street there is a Wall
 Post Box.                             
  Another main feature is the Council  
 Building Plot which  seperates Meadow 
 Lane and Tennyson Close,this is used  
 as a playing field as the Council have
 not done anything with it.There is    
 also some building taking place down  
 Meadow Lane which  will bring the     
 total resedences down that road  to   
 nine.                                 
  Benniworth Church is thought to be   
 Norman though we can not be sure.     </content>
