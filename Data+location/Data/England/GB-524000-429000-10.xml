		<title>10THE HOLDERNESS DIARY</title>
		<content>      The Diary was started in 1983 as 
 a hobby for Mr. and Mrs. P.B.Smith.   
 The Diary was never meant to be too   
 much like a newspaper. It is more for 
 local interest and includes a Diary of
 Local Events. They particularly avoid 
 printing BAD news.                    
      The Holderness Diary is designed,
 typed and prepared at 17 Kissing Gate,
 Burton Pidsea. The Smiths do          
 practically all the work themselves,  
 apart from the printing and they find 
 the work very absorbing. They spend a 
 lot of time collecting information and
 reading articles at the Local History 
 Library. As soon as one issue is      
 complete work begins on the next one. 
      Local businesses help to finance 
 the Diary by paying for advertising,  
 although classified advertisements are
 free. 2000 copies are given away free 
 each month.                           </content>
