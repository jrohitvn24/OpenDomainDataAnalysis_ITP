		<title>02HOUSING IN THE SEND AREA</title>
		<content> More than 70% of all houses in Send   
 and Sutton Green are detached and, of 
 these, about 10% stand in plots of    
 land greater than one quarter of a    
 hectare. Of the rest, most are        
 semi-detached with just a few pre-    
 first world war cottages built in     
 small terraces.                       
 There are a few notable old houses    
 which range from a Medieval farmhouse 
 to a handful of large Victorian       
 dwellings. The majority of houses were
 built after the second world war,     
 including a fairly substantial number 
 of detached and semi-detached         
 bungalows.                            
 Most properties in the area are       
 privately owned but there are three   
 medium-sized council estates in Send, 
 one of which includes a small number  
 of bungalows for the elderly.
