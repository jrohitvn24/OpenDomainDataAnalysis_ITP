		<title>08Debach and Boulge.</title>
		<content>     Debach is a very small village and
the only amenities are a post box and a
public telephone box. There was a      
church and a school but they have both 
been converted into houses.            
     Boulge is even smaller and only   
has a post box but the church has been 
restored. There is a font that was made
from limestone. It is square outside   
and the round where the dip is for     
the baby to go in, is sixty two        
centimetres across. It was made in     
1150. The walls are made of flint      
but the tower was built much later     
in red brick. The bell was all broken  
and rusty so when Mickfield church     
was closed its bell was brought to     
Boulge. The church is dedicated to St. 
Michael and all Angels. In the church  
yard is the grave of Edward Fitzgerald 
1809-1883, poet and translator of the  
Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.              </content>
