		<content> We interviewed our local policeman,   
 Mr Searle, who lives in the police    
 house next to the school.             
                                       
 He told us that the hardest crimes    
 he usually has to deal with are       
 vandalism and theft. The sort of      
 trouble that young people tend to get 
 into stems from boredom _ petty       
 vandalism etc. In the country, quite a
 lot of farming machinery is stolen.   
                                       
 The policeman also said that the most 
 money ever stolen was Â£500, from an   
 old lady. The oldest  person he had   
 ever arrested was 70 years old (for   
 drinking and driving), and the        
 youngest person was 16 years old (for 
 theft). Mr Searle also said that the  
 biggest burglary lately was in our    
 local jewellery shop.
