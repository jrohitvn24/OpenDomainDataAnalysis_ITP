		<title>19TOURISM:ASHLEWORTH</title>
		<content> This is a mainly unspoilt rural area  
 with winding lanes,wide verges and    
 pleasant views over the water meadows 
 to the{River Severn}and beyond.In     
 summer motorists take to the lanes in 
 search of a picnic spot,while in      
 autumn they are blackberrying.The main
 tourist attractions are a fine group  
 of buildings near the river comprising
 the Church,Court,Manor and the{Tithe  
{Barn }(the latter owned by the        
 National Trust) and the Boat Inn at   
 Ashleworth Quay,where a{ferry}used to 
 take passengers across the river and  
 barges called in on their way up or   
 down river.Nowadays many small craft  
 tie up at the Quay and their crews use
 the facilities at the Boat Inn.A few  
 paying guests stay in the village and 
 there is also a cottage which is let  
 to tourists.Sometimes Americans stay  
 at this cottage.                      </content>
