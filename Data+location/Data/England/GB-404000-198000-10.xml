		<title>10THE VILLAGE OF DRIFFIELD</title>
		<content> In many ways Driffield is a typical   
 Cotswold village. The population has  
 declined over the years ( there are   
 now 113 on the Parish electoral       
 roll),due largely to the mechanisation
 of farming. However, there are now    
 more houses, and the people living in 
 the village all seemed very pleased to
 be there. It is an attractive, well   
 kept village, with a beautiful Manor  
 House, owned by Mr. Michael Ingram.   
 Some years ago, the land farmed as    
 Manor Farm, was sold to its present   
 owners, Messrs. Henly, Swettenham, and
 Ford.The old school is now a private  
 dwelling, as for some time there have 
 not been sufficient  village children 
 to justify keeping a school open.     
 These changes in the pattern of life  
 in a village, from a busy agricultural
 community,to a beautiful,sleepy back  
 water are familiar in the Cotswolds.  </content>
