		<title>12Chapel St. Leonards Farming</title>
		<content> Chapel St. Leonards is well known for 
 its  crops.There are quite a few      
 farms in Chapel St. Leonards.There are
 two fields at the back of my house.We 
 usally grow wheat and barley.Every day
 when I get up I always hear the       
 cattle.One third of the land is used  
 for farming in Chapel St. Leonards.   
 Chapel St. Leonards surrounded by     
 fields and farmland.Most of the cows  
 in Chapel St. Leonards do not give    
 milk they are kept for their          
 meat.There is an animal market in     
 Alford every Tuesday where the cattle 
 are bought and sold.
