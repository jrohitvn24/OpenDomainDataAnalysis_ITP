		<title>02RIVER WYRE &amp; RESERVOIR</title>
		<content>    The R.Wyre flows through a winding 
 steep-sided wooded valley  and though 
 a swift response to heavy rainfall on 
 the surrounding fells produces rapid  
 changes in level, flooding is not a   
 major problem. It is not navigable and
 is crossed in this stretch only by two
 small footbridges. Below Abbeystead a 
 dam was built by Lancaster Corporation
 in 1853 to supply compensation water  
 for mills (now derelict) downstream.  
 Due to silting the capacity of the    
 present reservoir (less than 14M      
 gallons) is very much smaller than    
 its maximum 185M gallons and its area 
 has been reduced to less than 1/3 its 
 original 60 acres. The water is now   
 controlled by the North-West Water    
 Authority and just below the dam, on  
 each side of the river is an outflow  
 chamber for water diverted via a      
 tunnel from the R.Lune. (see Page 3)  </content>
