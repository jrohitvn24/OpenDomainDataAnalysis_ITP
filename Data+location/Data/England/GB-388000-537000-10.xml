{the countryside.}Most tourists and    
 caravaners come from Tyneside and     
 Wearside. In Westgate there are three 
{caravan sites}and one in St Johns     
 Chapel. Altogether there are about 100
 caravans in our area. At the petrol   
 station is a{campsite}for small       
 caravans and tents. Sometimes we get  
 visitors from Holland, France and     
 Germany. The petrol station sells     
 sweets, cigarettes and calor gas for  
 them. The camp site in Westgate opens 
 from March to October. In St Johns    
 Chapel there are some{Bed and         
{Breakfast houses}and at the Golden    
 Lion there are some{holiday flats.    
{Many day trippers}come to have a      
 picnic in Slit Wood which is a local  
 beauty spot near Westgate. Tourists
