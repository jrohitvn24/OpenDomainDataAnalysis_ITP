		<title>08Restoration of old mill</title>
		<content>Sponsored by Oxfordshire County Council
(Department of Museum Services) there  
is a restoration project by the Wantage
Industrial Archaeology Group for the   
mill on the River Ock. The Mill is to  
be restored to working condition and   
open to the public as a site museum.   
Work began in l977. The machinery was  
treated for rust and woodworm, the     
stonework has been brushed and         
repainted, and some window sills and   
floorboarding have been renewed. A new 
access stairway is now under           
construction. A replacement wheel has  
been obtained, and is undergoing       
restoration. It will be then be fitted 
to the original shaft. Volunteers work 
on the project every alternate Sunday  
morning. Much remains to be done, but  
when all is completed, there will be a 
working mill on this site which was    
recordede in the 1st Domesday survey.  </content>
