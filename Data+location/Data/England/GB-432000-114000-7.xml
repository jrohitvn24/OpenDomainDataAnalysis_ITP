		<content> When the M.27 was planned across the  
 Hampshire countyside,gravel had to be 
 extracted to make concrete,one site   
 chosen was on the proposed route near 
 the River Test.{The flooding of the   
{pits in 1975 with water from the river
{created Broadlands  a coarse fishing  
{lake on the estate of Lord Romsey.}The
 lake was opened to the first fishermen
 in 1977.{It covers an area of         
{approximately 11 acres and is 13 feet 
{deep at it's deepest point,}many      
 millions of fish start life in the    
 lake,they include Carp,Mirror Carp,   
 Tench,Bream,Roach and Pike.The largest
 fish caught to date has been a Pike of
{39 lbs 4 ozs},12 ozs short of the     
 British record.{Fishing cost Â£2.70 a  
{day Â£1.35 for a junior under the age  
{of 16.}In the summer months 300 to 400
 people come to fish every week,Sunday 
 being the busiest day.                </content>
