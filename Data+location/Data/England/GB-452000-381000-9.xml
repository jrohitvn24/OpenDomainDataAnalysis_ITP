		<title>09Comparing the Villages</title>
		<content>{Woodsetts,Shireoaks}and{Thorpe Salvin 
 are all completely different villages.
{Thorpe Salvin}probably has the most   
 expensive houses in the three         
 villages because they are large,old   
 and attractive.If you lived in{Thorpe 
{Salvin}you might not choose to buy a  
 house in{Shireoaks}because it is a{pit
{village}and some of the houses are    
 terraced.{Thorpe Salvin}is a small    
 village with not many houses.It is    
 surrounded by farmland.{Woodsetts}is  
 not such a wealthy village,but some   
 houses are expensive.There are more   
 houses in{Woodsetts}than in{Thorpe    
{Salvin.}Most houses in{Woodsetts}are  
 attractive and new.In{Shireoaks}many  
 families may work at the{mine.}The    
{mine }is near the houses.
