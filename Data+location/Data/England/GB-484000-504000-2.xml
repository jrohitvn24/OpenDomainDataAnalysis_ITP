 Southbound from Sleights and "the last
 petrol for 17 miles", the A169 makes a
 1 in 5 ascent to the{Bluebank}top car 
 park and a view of Whitby Abbey. The  
 road then continues straight across   
 the moor to the{Bronze Age burial site
{Pen Howe,}and the junction of the A169
 with the road to Grosmont.            
                                       
 This is the{heather dominated upland} 
 section where black-faced sheep can   
 sometimes be seen grazing in peril at 
 the road side verge.                  
                                       
 Cleared by snowploughs in the winter  
 blizzards but thronging with traffic  
 in the summer sun, the A169 is for    
 residents and visitors alike,{a       
{vitally important route}between Whitby
 and the Vale of Pickering.
