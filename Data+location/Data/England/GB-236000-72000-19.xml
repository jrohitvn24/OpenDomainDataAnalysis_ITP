		<content> IT IS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT IN  
 A CHANGING WORLD THE SURVEY AREA IS   
 CHANGING MORE RAPIDLY THAN MOST.      
 PHYSICALLY, IT HAS CHANGED LITTLE, AND
 WHAT CHANGES THERE HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN
 FOR THE BETTER. THE DUCHY HAVE        
 RECENTLY GIVEN PERMISSION FOR THE     
 EXTRACTION OF MINE WASTE AT LUCKETT,  
 THE WORK AND REINSTATEMENT OF THE     
 LANDSCAPE TO TAKE UP TO A YEAR TO     
 COMPLETE. RATHER THE CHANGES HAVE BEEN
 IN THE POPULATION AND THE DIFFERENT   
 ATTITUDES AND LIFE STYLES THE         
 NEWCOMERS HAVE BROUGHT TO THE AREA.   
 FOR THE MOST PART, THE INTEGRATION HAS
 BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH LITTLE RESENTMENT
 OR SUSPICION ON EITHER SIDE. IT       
 REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOWEVER WHETHER THE
 INEVITABLE DEMISE OF THE CORNISH      
 MAJORITY WILL HASTEN THE FEAR THAT THE
 AREA WILL BECOME LITTLE MORE THAN A   
 MIDDLE CLASS DORMITORY OF PLYMOUTH.   </content>
