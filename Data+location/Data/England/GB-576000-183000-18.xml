		<title>18Benfleet - The Village</title>
		<content>  Originally,in the early part of the  
 century,the old village centre        
 clustered around St.Mary's church.    
 There was a general store and school, 
 the area would have declined          
 completely when the shops spread up   
 the High Road, were it not for the    
 location of the railway station in    
 Ferry Road. This brings commutors to  
 Benfleet village where they park their
 cars on the car park,situated on the  
 site of the ancient 892 battle between
 the Saxons &amp; Danes.(There is a plaque 
 commemorating this event on the church
 wall).Benfleet is also alive at       
 weekends,as the village has several   
 leisure orientated businesses such as 
 the three pubs with gardens,two       
 restaurants,a shell fish bar,boat     
 builders,yacht club and moorings.     
 There are several small businesses    
 located there as well.                </content>
