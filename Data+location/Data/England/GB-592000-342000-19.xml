   The severity of the winter is much  
modified by the coastal location of the
area and most of the cereal crops are  
winter grown.  However, conditions in  
the Spring with low rain fall amounts  
and temperatures above 5 degree C. are 
ideal for seed bed cultivation and     
germination of spring barley.          
   Apparently detrimental to the role  
of the area as a holiday resort is the 
high rainfall in August.  However this 
is restricted to a few rainy days with 
heavy showers or thunderstorms created 
by high land temperatures setting up   
convectional air currents.             
   Increasing rainfall in October and  
November occasionally holds up the     
sugarbeet harvest but once again the   
modified winter temperatures mean that 
in this area the beet can be stored in 
the open without too much damage.      </content>
