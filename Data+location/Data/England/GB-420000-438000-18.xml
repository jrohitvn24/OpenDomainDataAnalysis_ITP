		<title>18Farming-Rawdon + Horsforth 2</title>
		<content>{Local History-}Much of the farmland in
 the area belonged to a mere handful of
 families.The Craven family were       
 landowners until 1941.They were in    
 fact tanners.Tanhouse cottage still   
 exists near Scotland Beck.The Inghams 
 lived in the area and their           
 descendants,the Pullans still do.The  
 Pullans had built up a thriving flax  
 bleaching works but this suffered at  
 the end of the 19thC.as linen was     
 replaced by cotton.The Stanhope family
 also owned much estate in the Bayton  
 area.Their land adjoined that of the  
 Rathmell family in Rawdon.Most of the 
 farmland was reclaimed moorland.Much  
 of the farming area(probably 10%)has  
 been lost since 1931 to the Leeds     
 Bradford Airport.There are two        
 extensive golf courses,and a great    
 deal of housing development in the    
 area.                                 </content>
