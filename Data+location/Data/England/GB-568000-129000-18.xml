		<content>    The nearest public indoor swimming 
 pools are at Tunbridge Wellls and     
 Hastings. Our local secondary school, 
 Uplands Community College, Wadhurst   
 has an outdoor pool that is made      
 available during the summer holidays. 
    We do not have a swimming pool at  
 our school but are able to use the    
 pool at Uplands during the summer     
 term. This year we had eight one hour 
 sessions which were used by the two   
 older classes. We travel by coach     
 hired from a Ticehurst firm. This year
 for the first time parents were       
 invited to donate Â£1 per child towards
 the cost of swimming.                 
    We think school swimming is        
 important because in the three younger
 classes there are only 13 children who
 can swim  but in the two older classes
 55 children can swim.
