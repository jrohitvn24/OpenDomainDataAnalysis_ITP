		<content> This area is quite an old area. Some  
 of the houses and cottages are over   
 five-hundred years old. Most of the   
 old buildings are obviously toward the
 centre of the villages. Certain more  
 recent road redevelopment has changed 
 the aspect of Whatton, and there is   
 now a distinct old village and a new  
 one separated by a road.   There has  
 been little new development in        
 Scarrington; what there is can be seen
 as individual buildings built at      
 different times over the years.  In   
 Aslockton and Whatton, a number of    
 small private and council housing     
 estates have been developed firstly to
 serve the area as a dormitory village 
 and later development because         
 Nottinghamshire villages have become  
 desirable places to live, for the more
 wealthy.                              
                                       </content>
