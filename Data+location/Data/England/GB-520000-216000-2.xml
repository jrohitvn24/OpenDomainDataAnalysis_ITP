		<title>02ORIGINS OF CODICOTE/WELWYN</title>
		<content>  In pre-Roman times, in a forest      
 clearing, lived Cedda or Cudda in his 
 hut or cot. Over the years Cudda's    
 Cot, or Codicote grew and by 1085     
 there was a village housing about 24  
 people, a manor and an estate owned by
 St.Albans.                            
  Welwyn, meaning "by willows", grew   
 by the ford across the River Mimram,  
 which enabled the Belgic settlers to  
 travel between Wheathampstead and     
 Braughing. Later the Romans used the  
 ford on their route between St.Albans,
 and Colchester.(The remains of the    
 bathing suite of a Roman villa have   
 been preserved for all to see under   
 the motorway at Welwyn.) By 1085      
 Welwyn had a population of about 200  
 and it continued to grow especially   
 when the road through it became "The  
 Great North Road".
