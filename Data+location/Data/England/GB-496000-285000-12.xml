		<title>12FARMING BROTHERS IN LYVEDEN</title>
		<content>  There are two brothers who farm in   
 Lyveden very close to each other.     
 Their farms are about half a mile     
 apart. They have lived there for over 
 two generations. They own about 250   
 acres each, and they farm arable      
 crops, cattle and sheep.              
 The two farms are called Springwood   
 House and Springwood Lodge.           
  In winter Lyveden particularly       
 suffers, as the harsh snow falls drift
 a lot in that area.We were told by the
 inhabitants of Springwood lodge that  
 in the winter of 1981 they were snowed
 in for five days. During that time no 
 vehicles could get through the snow   
 blocks. They claimed the snow was at  
 hedge height(5 or 6 feet). This whole 
 area is usually very dry and averages 
 less than 25 inches of rain per annum,
 which is one reason why lots of cereal
 crops are grown on arable farms here. </content>
