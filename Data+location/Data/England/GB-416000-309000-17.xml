Our groups have made several different 
field trips to the different woodlands 
in our square.In Brookhay wood and     
Wetleyhay wood we found Oak trees and  
evidence of many of the living things  
that find a home in an Oak tree.They   
were grey squirrels,rabbits,woodmice,  
caterpillars,Oak galls and others.The  
grund was soft and springy with leaves.
We also found Larch and Alder.In other 
areas there were Brambles and other    
sadly dumped rubbish.It was very       
exciting and peaceful in the woods.
