		<title>12Epping Forest:Hawk Wood</title>
		<content> The{Hawk Wood,}part of{Epping Forest} 
 extends into square 3895 and is       
 important ecologically being          
 designated an SSSI.The wood is        
  composed of {oak and hornbeam}       
 secondary woodland with an understorey
 of holly,bramble and honeysuckle.Until
 1878 many trees were{pollarded}2/3    
 metres above the ground,a practice    
 which provided poles for firewood and 
 many other uses,but left a permanent  
 trunk or 'bolling' from which         
 successive crops of poles would sprout
 at a height at which grazing cattle   
 and deer could not reach.             
  Since 1878 pollarding has ceased and 
 as a result the pollards are now tall 
 and top heavy.Shading of the ground   
 layer by the spreading canopies       
 results in little light reaching the  
 forest floor and consequently the     
 ground flora is relatively sparse.    </content>
