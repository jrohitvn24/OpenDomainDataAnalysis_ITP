		<title>18The Huntsman Public House</title>
		<content>    There are three public houses in   
 Fryerning, but the only one in our    
 area is The Huntsman. The building    
 there at the moment is about one      
 hundred years old and has a well at   
 the back.                             
    The inn used to be The Maypole,    
 probably because it overlooks the     
 village Green, where an annual fair   
 was held. It was later called The     
 Woolpack, but was renamed The Huntsman
 about eight years ago.                
    Mrs.White told us that the inn used
 to be owned by Charrington's, but is  
 now a Free House, which means that    
 they can sell beers from different    
 breweries.                            
    There is no restaurant, but snack  
 meals can be ordered from the bar at  
 lunchtimes and in the early evening.
