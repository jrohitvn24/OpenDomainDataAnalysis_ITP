		<content>   Sandhole Wood,owned by the District 
 Council and neglected for 40 years,was
 leased in 1984 to be developed as a   
{nature reserve.}Its half a hectare is 
 largely covered in overgrown chestnut 
 coppice with individual stands of oak 
 ash,beech,maple and willow.Bramble    
 clearance and some felling is allowing
 the natural flora to regenerate.Vinca,
 balsam,bluebells,anemones,elecampane, 
 cuckoopint and hogweed flowered this  
 year.Two pheasants overwintered;      
 rabbits have a warren and a slowworm  
 was sunning itself on a sandy bank.   
 The soil is sand or sandy loam with   
 layered rock outcrops.A pond made from
 a wartime sewerage settling tank is   
 filling and ferns already fringe it.In
 all 7 trailer loads of litter,gathered
 laboriously by hand,were removed and  
 rottable rubbish buried in a 15ft.long
 trench.The paths are now walkable.    </content>
