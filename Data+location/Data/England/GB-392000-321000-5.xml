		<title>05THE NEW HOSPITAL IN STAFFORD</title>
		<content>  The new Stafford and District General
Hospital was officially opened on June 
5th, 1984 by the Duchess of Kent.      
     The building stands on the site of
the 150 year old Coton Hill            
Hospital, about 2 miles from the centre
of Stafford.       When it opened,three
smaller hospitals outside the town     
were closed,  but the old Staffordshire
General Infirmary is still in use,   at
least for the present.  The new site is
easy for patients and visitors to      
reach,     and there is a very good bus
service to the hospital.   The hospital
has 320 beds at the moment.   There are
five operating theatres,  a most modern
physiotherapy and X-Ray department,    
and of course a large well equipped    
Accident and Emergency area.        The
hospital cost 20 million pounds and is 
providing Staffordshire with the very  
best of medical and surgical care.     </content>
