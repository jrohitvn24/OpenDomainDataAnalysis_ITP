		<content> Cutsdean Church is a sister Church of 
 St. Mary's, Temple Guiting. They share
 an incumbent,Rev.S. Wilson. Services  
 are held in the church every Sunday   
 morning and it holds its own major    
 religious celebrations such as        
 Christmas and Harvest.                
 The church is very small with room for
 no more than 30 people and has no     
 Vestry,the door opening directly onto 
 the Farmyard of Cutsdean Farm in which
 it stands somewhat hidden away. It can
 just be seen from the Ford to         
 Snowshill lane which passes to the    
 West of Cutsdean.                     
 The church is a Church of England     
 church.
