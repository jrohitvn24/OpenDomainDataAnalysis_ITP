		<content> The landscape is flat to gently       
 undulating, chiefly given over to     
 arable crops such as cereals, sugar   
 beet and oilseed rape. Very little    
 grassland, but two dairy herds and    
 some intensive pig and poultry        
 husbandry. Very sparse woodland of    
 ash, elm etc. The soil is boulder     
 clay. The population is roughly 1100, 
 mostly occupied with the needs of the 
 farming community and some light      
 industry. Stradbroke was formerly a   
 market town with its own railway      
 station, now vanished. Public         
 transport being minimal, most people  
 rely on their own car for reaching    
 their place of work and for such      
 shopping items as cannot be obtained  
 within the village. The Primary and   
 High Schools serve surrounding        
 villages, and pupils transfer to      
 Framlingham, for VIth Form education. </content>
