		<content> The club or 'Friendly Society' is     
 unique being the oldest of only 2 such
 clubs in Devon. It is for men only.   
 The club was founded on August 27th   
 1838 with an annual subscription from 
 members to provide sick pay: 5s a week
 if a bed case, 3.6s a week for walking
 sick with a death benefit payment of  
 Â£40. This is still valid today. 51    
 members pay an annual subscription of 
 50p. On reaching the age of 70 years  
 they are made life members and are    
 awarded free membership. The club     
 celebrates its anniversay on May Bank 
 Holidy beginning with a roll call and 
 a procession round the village,       
 preceded by a silver band and 2       
 members carrying a banner. A church   
 service is followed by a dinner in the
 village hall provided by the local    
 ladies. Members pay Â£1 &amp; the meal is  
 subsidised by the club's investments. </content>
