		<title>03EMPLOYMENT IN MELKSHAM</title>
		<content>   Unemployment is a serious problem   
 nationwide.  However, Melksham's      
 unemployment is not as serious as some
 places like the North of England.  The
 biggest employer in the town is the   
 Avon rubber factory.  The GEC is quite
 a big business too.  These people make
 parts for engines, tractors, cars and 
 lorries.                              
   Throughout Melksham there are shops 
 which employ some people full time.   
 Supermarkets like Gateway, Spar and   
 International employ people to stack  
 shelves and put prices on tins.       
   The West of England Farmers has been
 knocked down and now by the Scout Hut 
 the builders are making a new shopping
 area.  This should make Melksham more 
 popular for shopping and visiting.
