		<title>13GIRL'S SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> Today is Wednesday.I set off for      
 school at 8.35am.The bell goes at     
 8.55am.We line up and go into         
 school.The teacher takes              
 registration.We go into the hall.One  
 class tells the rest a story.We sing  
 a song and say a prayer.After that we 
 go back into the class and do maths.At
 the moment we are doing algebra.We do 
 that until 10.30am then we go outside 
 for break.After that we carry on with 
 English until 12.00 lunchtime.I go    
 home and eat with my mum.At 1.15pm we 
 go in to school again and go into     
 another classroom for science.We learn
 about lots of things like electricity,
 weather and the human body.After about
 30 minutes we have music until        
 afternoon play.When break is over we  
 get changed for games.The boys play   
 cricket and the girls play rounders.
