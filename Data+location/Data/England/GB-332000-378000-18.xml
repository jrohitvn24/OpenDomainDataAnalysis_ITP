		<title>18A GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> This area of the Wirral Penisular is a
 mixture of houses and countryside .   
 Infact as far as the Merseyside       
 conurbation is concerned this is where
 the houses stop and the country       
 begins.                               
                                       
 The houses themselves fall            
 into three catgories -the groups of   
 private houses built on a large       
 estate with small gardens and small   
 access roads,a large group of         
 post-war council houses and the       
 beginings of a very rural village with
 big victorian villas and large        
 spacious bungalows.                   
                                       
 Much of the rest of the area is       
 farmland much of which is used for    
 growing fodder crops particularly     
 grass.Here and there are to be found  
 market gardens.                       </content>
