		<title>11Grimshaw Hall, Knowle</title>
		<content>      Grimshaw Hall is one of the      
 oldest houses in Knowle. it is said   
 that a ghost 'walks' in one of the    
 bedrooms. The ghost is a beautiful    
 lady dressed for a ball who was       
 murdered by a jealous lover.          
      There are 18 rooms in Grimshaw   
 Hall and downstairs there are         
 inglenook fireplaces so big that you  
 can stand in them. When you look up   
 the tall chimney you can see the sky. 
      In the hall you can see a window 
 with writing on. It was scratched with
 a diamond and said:Nancy Grimshaw and 
 Fanny Grimshaw: and a message:'My gray
 has had ye day' when her horse won a  
 race.                                 
      The timber beams made beautiful  
 patterns of diamonds, triangles and   
 squares. The tall Tudor chimneys were 
 built of small re bricks and rose in  
 close groups from the roofs.          </content>
