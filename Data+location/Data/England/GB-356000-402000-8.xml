The lakes and ponds were made by sunken
land where coal mines had been.  There 
were old railways and derelict land.   
Now there is grass that used to be slag
heaps which makes wildlife more inter- 
esting. When we went, we saw Canada    
geese. They were brown, black and      
white. There are crops in the fields   
now. The farmer gave us a piece of     
barley. They planted trees that are    
beginning to grow. They are about one  
metre high. In 20 to 100 years nature  
will take over. Birds will build their 
nests, squirrels will come, fish will  
be in the lakes, little creatures will 
come and wild flowers will grow. So    
there will be a forest in time.
