		<title>16BROADCLYST CHURCH</title>
		<content> The{church}was built in the early 15th
 century.It is{485}years old,soon it   
 will be{500}years old.It is a         
{mediaeval}church.It has never been    
 rebuilt because it has never had a    
 fire etc.There are no ghost stories   
 or anything.Before it was built there 
 probably was a{Norman church}on the   
 site.There has been exactly{37}vicars 
 serving in the {church.}It has got 132
 steps up the tower.{Helen Johns.}     
{BLOODSPORTS.}Bloodsport is a sport    
 with animals involved. Bloodsport is a
 cruel sport and you kill animals,     
 probably chasing after them with dogs 
 or shooting them. If you kill animals 
 for food it is not a bloodsport. Deep 
 sea fishing is not a bloodsport       
 because it is for food.Killing animals
 for their skin or tusks is a blood-   
 sport because it is not necessary.
