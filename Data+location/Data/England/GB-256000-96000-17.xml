		<content>{  French skipping}is a{game}played in 
 which we have good fun and it's one of
 the most popular games in school for  
 girls. It is played with about{three  
{metres of elastic.}It is tied into a  
 ring. Two people stand with their feet
 in the elastic. Three or more people  
 can play.                             
   One girl starts jumping over the    
 elastic on normals which is standing  
 with your feet about one pace apart   
 and the elastic round their ankles.   
   When she has done that the people at
 the ends put the elastic round their  
 knees then thighs, waists and some    
 people even do armpits and necks.     
   Then the people at the ends put     
 their feet tight together which makes 
 it a bit harder for the person who is 
 jumping.Next they put just one foot in
 the elastic.Then they stand with their
 feet as far apart as they can.        </content>
