		<content> The main route in the area studied is 
 the A464(T) from Telford to the West  
 Midlands.There are a number of minor  
 roads crossing the area but the       
 majority of small metalled roads in   
 the area provide access to farms and  
 large houses in the area.The minor    
 roads link the A464 with the villages 
 of Ryton, Albrighton and Tong.The A464
 is on the line of a coaching road     
 between London and Holyhead with      
 Whiston Cross in the NW corner being  
 halfway between the two.The A464      
 exists in its original form apart from
 a straightening and raising by the    
 Cosford Bridge Pumping Station.This   
 improvement was to lift the road above
 an area of flooding.The volume of     
 traffic using the road was greatest in
 1975 and has substantially reduced    
 with the opening of the M54.Traffic   
 now consists of commuters and lorries.</content>
