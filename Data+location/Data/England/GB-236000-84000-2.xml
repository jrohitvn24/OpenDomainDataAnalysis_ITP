 Several people are employed at        
 Plymouth {Naval}Dockyards.The peaceful
 atmosphere of {LIFTON}is occasionally 
 shattered by the screech of jet       
 engines as{R.A.F}Fighter planes from  
{R.A.F }Chivenor practice overhead.    
 From our surveys we found people to be
 generally contented,pleased with the  
 area and happy to live here.          
    However,some worries were mentioned
 like the proposed new by-pass on the  
 A30 which may cause disruption to     
 shopkeepers and farmers whose land    
 will be used.Many residents will be   
 pleased about the proposed by-pass    
 because it will be less noisy and less
  dangerous than at present.The present
 authors both live on the {A30}but only
 find it inconvenient in summer.       </content>
