		<title>16Calver Sough Housing.</title>
		<content> Housing at Calver Sough, in the North 
 East corner of the area, is quite     
 unlike the rest of the block. Except  
 for one house at 238749 and a number  
 of properties between 240744 and      
 240747 (on the western end of the old 
 village) all housing is post 1920 and 
 suburban in style, either rendered, or
 stone (rarely), or stone-faced, or    
 faced in a material like stone.       
 Development roads generally appear to 
 comply with standard suburban new     
 street widths, though short stretches 
 of old lane remain. The A623 has tall 
 steel lamp standards producing an     
 orange light alongside thehouses.     
 The style and character contrasts with
 the traditional character which the   
 Peak National Park now increasingly   
 demands.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
