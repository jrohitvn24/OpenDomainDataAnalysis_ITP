		<title>15Knowsley Hall Survey</title>
		<content>   On Friday 27th June a group from    
 Nine Trees School went to interview   
 the Estates Manager at Knowsley Hall. 
   Here are some of the 34 questions   
 and replies:                          
   "We think that some of the land from
 the estate was sold for houses. Can   
 you tell us of this?                  
  {"Before the war people decided that 
{more people should live in the country
{so they moved there."                 
   "In what way has the land changed in
 the area of Knowsley village?"        
  {"It depends on the people and the   
{number of buildings.  There has to be 
{a balance."                           
    His answers helped us in our survey
 of the estate land that came into our 
 sector.  He also took us around the   
 Hall which the Earl of Derby does not 
 live in any more.
