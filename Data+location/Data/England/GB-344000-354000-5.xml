		<title>05A Day At School</title>
		<content> When I get up I put on my school      
 uniform. Then I make my breakfast my  
 self. Somedays I have toast or        
 cornflakes. I make my mum and dad a   
 cup of tea in the morning. I go to    
 school on the bus and I sit by my     
 friend Rebecca. The school bus picks  
 up 50 children from Farndon,          
 Coddington, Clutton, Handley and      
 Barton. The driver takes children to  
 Malpas High School after we get off at
 Clutton.                              
 My favourite dinner at school is      
 chips, beans and sausages. My         
 favourite pudding is chocolate eclair.
 After dinner we have assembly and our 
 teacher talks about something to do   
 with God.                             
 After break we go into the class room.
 This week the head teacher showed us  
 the new video we bought from the      
 school fund.                          </content>
