		<content> (6&amp;7 yrs accounts) We went for a walk 
 round the school to find wild flowers.
 We also went for trips in the car     
 around the area to find more flowers. 
 We saw yellow, white, blue, red, pink 
 and purple flowers. They were mainly  
 white. We saw lots of{buttercups}and  
{daisies}in the fields and{dead-nettle 
 and{cow parsley}in the hedges. The    
{primrose}and the{cowslip}are not      
 common any more. Some of our          
 favourites were the{poppy, bluebell,  
{Herb Robert}and{Lady's Smock.}We      
 thought the{dandelion}was a weed. My  
 rabbit likes it. We didn't like the   
 smell of the{garlic mustard.}The bees 
 liked the{honey-suckle.}The blue      
{forget-me-not}grows all over. We hold 
 the{buttercup}under our chin to see if
 we like butter. We made chains with   
 the{daisies,}to put round our head.   
 The{foxglove}is poisonous.            </content>
