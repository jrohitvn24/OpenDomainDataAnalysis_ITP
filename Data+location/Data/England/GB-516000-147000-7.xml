		<title>07DORKING OPEN AIR MARKET</title>
		<content> Most people went to the market on a   
 regular basis and the majority agreed 
 that it was cheeper than the          
 shops,but,the items were often not as 
 good quality.The most common things   
 that were bought were fruit and       
 vegetables.                           
  We interviewed the stallholders,     
  they were asked:                     
 Do you only go to Dorking ?           
 If not,where else ?                   
 Is Dorking good for business ?        
 Where do you live ?                   
  We found that most of the holders    
 travelled to other markets,some very  
 far away.eg Chichester,Canterbury and 
 Oxford.                               
  A good half of those we interviewed  
 lived up to fifty miles away and      
 agreed that Dorking provided good     
 enough business to make the journey   
 worth while.                          </content>
