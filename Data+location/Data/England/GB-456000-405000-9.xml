 playing it a lot.I am training for a  
 football team this season called the  
 Westminster Colts Under 13 team.I have
 got three trophies and one shield.I   
 received these when playing for a team
 called Co-op Imps Under 12 team.They  
 were a very good team and got through 
 to two finals but we lost one of them.
