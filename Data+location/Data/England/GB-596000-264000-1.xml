		<title>01ELMSWELL</title>
		<content>There are about 2450 people living in  
Elmswell.   The village is about half a
mile from the A45.   The A.45 is a     
major road which runs across East      
Anglia from East to West.   Many people
use Elmswell as a dormitory town and   
come along the A45 to towns such as    
Bury St. Edmunds, Ipswich or even to   
the large dock complex at Felixstowe.  
There is also a regular rail service   
which runs from the village railway    
station.   This makes it easy for      
people to travel to Ipswich, Cambridge 
or Norwich.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
Our survey was carried out in school   
and shows how many people work in      
Elmswell, and how many people commute.
