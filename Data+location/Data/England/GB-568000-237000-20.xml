		<title>20STAMBOURNE: SOCIAL STRUCTURE</title>
		<content>  Until 5 or 10 years ago it seemed    
 that Stambourne was becoming a village
 of old people. Since that time more   
 families with children have moved in, 
 so that there is now a wide age-range 
 in the population. The only employment
 in the village is farming, haulage and
 service industries: workers commute to
 London, Cambridge, Haverhill, Halstead
 &amp;c. There are several families whose  
 members have lived in the village all 
 their lives, or near-by. Several      
 others have moved from the N. and E.  
 suburbs of London. Property in        
 Stambourne is slightly cheaper than   
 further south (eg. Bardfield) or east 
 (nearer Sudbury). Newcomers to the    
 village have been welcomed into       
 existing institutions and contribute  
 to them, but their presence causes    
 changes.                              
                                       </content>
