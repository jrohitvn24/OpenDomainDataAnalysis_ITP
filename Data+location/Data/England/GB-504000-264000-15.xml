		<title>15Education in Swineshead</title>
		<content> There is no school in Swineshead so   
 children from the village have to     
 travel to surrounding villages to get 
 their schooling.                      
 Pre-school children have the choice of
 going to various playgroups in the    
 area; Pertenhall, Kimboltonor Little  
 Staughton. Most go to Pertenhall      
 playgroup, where they can start as    
 young as 1 year old, providing mum    
 goes along as well. When they are 3   
 years old, they go to playgroup 2     
 mornings a week, and are taught       
 nursery rhymes and otherbasics.       
 Most children then go on to Riseley   
 Nursery School, which is attached to  
 the Primary School. The Nursery School
 is a gradual introduction to school   
 life.After moving through Nursery and 
 Primary School, children move up to   
 Middle School and then onto the Upper 
 School whhich is at Sharnbrook.       </content>
