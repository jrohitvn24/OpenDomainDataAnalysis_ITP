		<content> The Group Parish Council of Ocle      
 Pychard has three members from Ocle   
 Pychard, three from Ullingswick and   
 two from Felton.  The councillors are 
 elected to serve for three years.  The
 council deals with planning           
 applications sending comments to the  
 Malvern Hills District Council.       
 Complaints or problems from residents 
 are passed on by the Parish Council to
 the appropriate body, in particular   
 the state of roads and drainage.  The 
 Parish Council is also responsible for
 the publication of a bi-monthly       
 community news-letter.  Refuse        
 collection operates on a fortnightly  
 basis in Ulingswick and Felton and is 
 run by sub-contractors to the Malvern 
 Hills District Council.  In Preston   
 Wynne refuse is collected weekly by   
 the Council's own lorry.
