		<title>06GEOLOGY OF FROXFIELD AREA</title>
		<content>  The geolgy of the area can be divided
 into two categories. To the south-east
 there is heavy clay, which is divided 
 from the rest of the area by two      
 scarps which in turn are divided by   
 'Upper Green sand'. The rest is       
 predominantly covered by chalk.       
  It is thought that at one time a     
 river may have run along the valley in
 which the main A272 now runs. Flint is
 also found in the area, but not on the
 two scarps.                           
  The main reason for the small number 
 of settlements in the area is that the
 land was not good for farming, and so 
 most of the early Saxon villages were 
 on the 'Upper Green sand', but now    
 farmers are persuaded by the EEC to   
 farm land they would otherwise not.   
 However,on the plateau,anything can be
 farmed as the soil is extremely rich  
 in silica.                            </content>
