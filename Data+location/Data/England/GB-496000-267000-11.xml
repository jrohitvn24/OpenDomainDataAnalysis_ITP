		<title>11THE CHURCH OF HIGHAM FERRERS</title>
		<content>    Since the 1300's religion in Higham
Ferrers has centred around the Church  
of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The        
impressive 170ft spire can be clearly  
seen from miles around. The dark stone 
interior of the church is brightened by
colourful stain glass windows and      
ornaments. This peaceful church        
provides a quiet sanctuary for prayer. 
    Christenings,confirmations,weddings
and funerals all take place at St.     
Mary's but the most popular service    
is Mass on Sunday. Many other          
activities take place in the church and
the adjacent Bede House e.g.Brownies   
and Guides.                            
    The present vicar enjoys his work  
and feels strongly about it. He is     
friendly,easy to talk to and very      
trustworthy since he leaves the church 
open during daylight despite the threat
of vandalism.                          </content>
