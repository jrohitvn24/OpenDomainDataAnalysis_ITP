		<title>16GOREY VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   {Gorric}is an old spelling of Gorey.
 In Norman Times Gorey was probably an 
{administrative centre}for the area in 
 which it is situated. In 1978 the     
 villagers' homes were badly flooded   
 and, as result, in 1979 drainage was  
 laid under the golf-links of the      
 Jersey Golf Club. In the 1980's the   
 drainage scheme had to be extended as 
 floods had hit the area again.        
                                       
    It was as a result of the important
{oyster fishing}industry that houses   
 were built in Gorey to accomodate the 
 employees of the industry and in 1832 
{Gouray Church}was built. The village  
 has recently been enlarged to provide 
 lower priced housing for Jersey       
 families. This development received a 
 Civic Trust Award in May 1985.
