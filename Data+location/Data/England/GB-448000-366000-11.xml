		<content>  Stony Houghton is a hamlet. It has   
 twelve cottages in it.There are three 
 farms inside Stony Houghton.There are 
 about one hundred and fifty trees,most
 of which have Dutch Elm disease.The   
 nearest shop and nearest school are in
 New Houghton,about a mile away.There  
 is a farm there which was an inn      
 about a hundred years ago. There is an
 old Roman path which looked like a    
 dirt track.In Stony Houghton there is 
 only one main road,which,one          
 afternoon,had a lot of traffic because
 of road works on the A617 road.There  
 is a thousand acre farm nearby owned  
 by the Duke of Devonshire,growing     
 potatoes and cereals principally.In   
 the hamlet there is only one telephone
 box.All the cottages were built from  
 stone.
