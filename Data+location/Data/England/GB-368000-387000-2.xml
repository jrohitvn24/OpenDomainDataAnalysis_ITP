		<title>02The Bridgewater Canal.</title>
		<content> The canal was built in{1760,}but it   
 has changed a lot since then. The old 
 warehouses have become camping shops, 
 engineering companies etc. The canal  
 is only used by pleasure craft now,   
 and we have a hire boat company at    
 Agden Wharf. They have a trip boat and
 a restaurant boat. The canal is full  
 of wildlife with wildflowers such as  
 buttercups and birds such as a female 
 mallard and her brood and a coot      
 with her brood. We have a lot of      
 fishermen on the canal, but we also   
 saw some dead fish.The houses are in  
 clumps facing onto the canal.One of   
 the large houses belonged to one of   
 the managers who built the canal.On   
 the bridges we can see where the ropes
 which were attached to the horses who 
 pulled the boats have rubbed against  
 the walls and eroded the bricks.
