		<title>06   BRIXHAM RUGBY CLUB</title>
		<content>  The Rugby Club is at the top of Rae  
 Barn Hill. It was founded in 1889.    
 There is a Social Club with four bars 
 and a lounge and is open to the       
 public.                               
 I go to train for Rugby on Thursdays. 
 We play rugby against other villages  
 and towns like Dartmouth, Torquay &amp;   
 Paignton. We also play other teams    
 which are on tour. We have played five
 different teams from Wales and many   
 others from outside Devon. There are  
 quite a few different age groups, they
 range from under 12's through to the F
 troop. The under 12's play 11 a side  
 and the 14's and over play rugby      
 league which is 15 a side.            
 There is a first team and a second    
 team which play matches quite often.  
 The club is very good, the third best 
 in England and is very well supported.
