		<content> Marland School, a private special     
 school, listed by the D.E.S. and      
 founded in 1967 is housed in the old  
 Vicarage Farm. The buildings have been
 considerably extended with the        
 addition of several classrooms,       
 hobbies rooms, a mini-gym, boarding   
 facilities, common rooms, kitchen and 
 dining room. There are 48 boys, all   
 boarders aged from 11_16, mostly from 
 Devon but all supported by their      
 L.E.As. The boys are educationally    
 backward and have behaviour problems  
 due to severe emotional  disturbances 
 in earlier years. A staff of 32       
 adults,10 of whom are teachers (some  
 part time) help with all aspects of   
 the children's lives. Leisure         
 activities include a wide range of    
 hobbies, indoor and outdoor pursuits, 
 such as swimming, canoeing, and       
 orienteering. Several playing fields. </content>
