		<title>02WILDLIFE IN LYNSTED</title>
		<content> There are many animals like hedgehogs,
 foxes, rabbits, mice, rats, voles &amp;   
 shrews. The hedgehogs are found round 
 apple orchards. Sometimes they get    
 into your garden. We have lots of     
 foxes and some of them do damage. A   
 few people have had geese &amp; chicken   
 eaten. The rabbits come in hundreds   
 and sometimes are a nuisance. If the  
 men up at the farm (Loyterton) are    
 having a bonfire sometimes a rabbit   
 gets burnt and runs out of the fire   
 screaming. There is a nest of baby    
 rabbits in a field near our house.    
 Mice can end up in your house! Rats   
 are everywhere &amp; they always try to   
 get your chickens! We have lost 4     
 chickens that way. I suppose we are   
 lucky having so much wildlife about   
 us. Keep still- there is always       
 something to see.
