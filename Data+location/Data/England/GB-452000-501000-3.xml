		<content> Today many people enjoy walking the   
 moors and hills.  Some walk short     
 distances while others enjoy long     
 walks such as The Cleveland Way, which
 is also part of a 42 mile 24hr walk:  
 The Lyke Wake Walk. It follows ancient
 burial routes.  As well as enjoying   
 fine panoramic views, there are       
 fossils to be found on Cringle Moor.  
 Occasionally walkers get into         
 difficulties needing the assistance of
 Cleveland Search &amp; Rescue. These are  
 skilled and experienced walkers, well 
 organized and equipped, who work in   
 conjunction with the police, RAF &amp;    
 other similar teams. They undertake   
 many hours of training and practice   
 rescues.  They agree to be  "on call",
 and give their time without payment . 
 They raise funds to provide their     
 equipment, but do not ask for or      
 accept money from those they rescue.  </content>
