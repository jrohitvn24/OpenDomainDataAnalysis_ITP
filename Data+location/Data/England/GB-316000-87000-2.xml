		<content> The population of Branscombe is about 
 500 people and they are scattered all 
 over the village. The Post Office is  
 the only shop that sells food and     
 sweets as well as people's allowances 
 and the daily papers.Branscombe Beach 
 is pebbly and it shelves VERY steeply 
 into the sea.There are two pubs in    
 Branscombe,the Masons Arms and the    
 Fountain Head. There are many         
 footpaths in Branscombe ,many are 2-3 
 miles long. If you go through Pitt    
 Coppice and follow the footpath along 
 and down the cliffs you can get to the
 beach. You can walk from Branscombe   
 to Weston beach over the cliffs  on   
 part of the National Trust coastal    
 footpath. Several cottages and farms  
 are also owned by the National Trust. 
 There is a mini bus service to Seaton 
 and Sidmouth twice a day.
