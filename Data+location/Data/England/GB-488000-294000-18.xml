"RED LETTER" : One person is on, and   
chooses a letter - called the RED      
LETTER. He stands several metres from  
the other players who are on a start   
line facing him. He calls out any      
letter. If a player has that letter in 
his name, he jumps as far as he can,   
but if he jumps when the RED LETTER is 
called, he must go back to the start.  
The first to cross to the caller is the
winner.                                
                                       
"HOP SCOTCH" : HOP SCOTCH is played on 
a grid of squares numbered 1 - 10. A   
player has to throw a stone into square
1. Then he hops over square 1, into    
every other square and back, picking up
the stone on his way. Then he repeats  
with square 2 and so on. Players take  
turns, the first to complete number 10 
being the winner.                      </content>
