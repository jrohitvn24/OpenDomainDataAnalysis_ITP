		<title>16      FABER SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Faber School,Cotton,designed by Pugin,
was built in 1847.Rev.Fr.Faber,who was 
working in the parish,wrote many hymns 
including "Faith of Our Fathers" and   
"Flowers for the Altar",which was for  
the children in school.When the College
took over their present buildings they 
used the school for a while,then it was
used as a house.Meanwhile there was a  
school in Golden Hill Farm where one of
the children was killed in a fire.This 
was Charlette Bamford,a relative of a  
current pupil.The school reopened in   
1897 and pupils,who started at 4+,left 
at 14+.Both Nuns,who lived next door   
to the school,and lay teachers,have    
taught here but now there are 2 staff, 
Mr.Jupp,the head teacher,and Mrs.Brown,
a former pupil,helped by Mrs.Moss and  
Mrs.Powell.Pupils go on to Painsley,   
Cheadle High or the College,having been
taught the usual range of subjects.    </content>
