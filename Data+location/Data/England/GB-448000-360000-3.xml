		<title>03Newspapers in Mansfield.</title>
		<content>  In Mansfield there are three main    
 newspapers. They are the Observer, the
 Recorder and the Chad. The Chad (or   
 Chronicle Advertiser) costs 20p and I 
 think it is very good value. The      
 Observer and the Recorder are free    
 newspapers. Both of these newspapers  
 depend entirely on the money they earn
 from their advertisers.               
                                       
  All of the papers carry very similiar
 sorts of advertising, mainly for motor
 cars, property, services and local    
 entertainmement. They also have local 
 news (much more in the Chad than the  
 others), TV program guides, womens    
 pages and sports coverage.
