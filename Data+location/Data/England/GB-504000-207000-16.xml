		<content>   {Primary schools}in the area are a  
 mixture of separate junior and infant 
 and JMI (Junior Mixed Infant) schools.
 There are one or two{nursery schools  
 and several voluntary{play groups.}In 
 the newer areas the schools are mainly
 "open-plan", with increasing numbers. 
 Many of the more "traditional" schools
 are in districts with falling rolls.  
 In Adeyfield 2 junior schools have    
 just amalgamated.{Secondary provision 
 consists of large mixed comprehensive 
 schools; one in each neighbourhood,   
 with a wide degree of parental choice.
 Herts County Council published a      
 Review of Secondary Education in      
 December 1984, showing a decline in   
 pupil numbers and asking for proposals
 for voluntary amalgamation of schools.

{education}and{evening classes}for the 
 district.                             </content>
