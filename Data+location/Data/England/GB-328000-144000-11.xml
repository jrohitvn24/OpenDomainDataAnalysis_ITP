             _________                 
 Number of people is ten at the        
 most.We play in the corner of the     
 play ground.1 person is the Ugly Snob 
 (the witch) and the others are        
 children.The children have 5          
 lives each.The children have to get   
 sweets out of the witches house with  
 out getting caught by the witch.If a  
 player is caught he or she has to     
 stand on a drain and has lost one     
 life.The one who loses his or her life
 first has to be the witch and the one 
 who was the witch,has to be a child.
