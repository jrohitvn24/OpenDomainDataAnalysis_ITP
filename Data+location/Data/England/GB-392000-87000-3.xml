 Wareham is a Profitable Outlet        
 because of tourists travelling to and 
 from the Isle of Purbeck.70% of sales 
 are the work of artists outside       
 Dorset.50% of sales are to impulse    
 buyers.This shows the importance of   
 the tourist trade to the shopkeeper   
 that does not have a local trade.     
 Mr.Headly agrees with Mr.Chaffy in    
 saying that local scenes sell well to 
 tourists{Sibley Pottery.              
 Sibley pottery has a restaurant and   
 a pottery shop.They sell slip cast    
 and hand thrown pottery it is no      
 longer made on the premises.Tourism   
 is vital to trade.Their peak time is  
 Summer Holidays.Their restaurant      
 receives more money than the shop.    
 Pottery is expensive due to lack of   
 trade.                                </content>
