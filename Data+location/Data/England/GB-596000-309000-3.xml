		<content> Within our 12 kilometer grid, 9 of the
 squares were categorized as farmland. 
 We carried out a survey of the farms  
 in our area. There are 10 working     
 farms in the area and 9 of these took 
 part in our survey.                   
 The average size of a farm in this    
 area is 235 acres. 8 of the farms are 
 family owned and only one was         
 tenanted. Virtually all the work on   
 the farms was done by members of the  
 family and great use was made of      
 machinery. Between them, the farms    
 owned 18 tractors and 11 combine      
 harvesters and a wide variety of other
 machinery and they worked on average  
 10 hours a day.                       
 70% of the land was used for growing  
 crops such as barley, wheat, rape and 
 sugar beet. The remainder of the land 
 was used for producing fodder or as   
 pasture.                              </content>
