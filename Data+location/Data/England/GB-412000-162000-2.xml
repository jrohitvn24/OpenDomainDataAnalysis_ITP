 Farms in the area tend to be quite    
 large, from 500-2000 acres(200-800    
 hectares).  Over the past ten years   
 they have tended to move more and more
 towards cereal productions. Though    
 most farms still rear some cattle for 
 beef, the French Limousin and         
 Charolais breeds have replaced the    
 more traditional Hereford and Friesian
 used by former dairy farmers. The     
 generous payments from the E.E.C. in  
 1983/84 to dairy farmers to end milk  
 production has seen the disappearance 
 of milking herds from 6 farms to 1.   
 Two farms have reintroduced some sheep
 rearing as the price of lambs has     
 become more attractive. The use of    
 bigger and bigger machines to cope    
 with the increased cereal production  
 has caused farmers to remove hedges to
 create larger fields.                 </content>
