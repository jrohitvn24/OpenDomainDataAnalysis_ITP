 This is part of a designated Area Of  
 Outstanding Natural Beauty. It        
 attracts visitors who appreciate the  
 peaceful and natural beauty of its    
 outlook. Across the bay can be seen   
 Grange-Over-Sands and further north   
 the Lakeland hills. There are various 
 footpaths which can be used to give a 
 pleasant walk of any desired distance.
 The RSPB own the coastline and are    
 extending their interest by building a
 hide on the marsh which attracts many 
 birdwatchers.                         
 The cliffs under Jack Scout and by the
 Cow's Mouth are 10 to 15 metres high  
 and are used by rock climbers.        
 A deep channel off Jenny Brown's Point
 is used in the summer for swimming.
