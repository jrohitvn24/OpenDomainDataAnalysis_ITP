		<content> This block consists of the villages of
 Cubley and Alkmonton and the northern 
 part of the parish of Boylestone. This
 rural area cmprises two small compact 
 villages with outlying mostly arable  
 or stock farms and a few dairy        
 farms.Nearly 3/4 of the land is fairly
 intensivly managed grassland providing
 silage, hay and grazing. The remainder
 is arable, barley and wheat           
 predominate with a small area of      
 pototoes and oil seed rape. Deciduous 
 woodland occurs in isolated patches.  
 Boundary hedges mosty comprise        
 quickthorn interspersed with damson,  
 oak, ash and elder. The land is       
 undulating and rises gently from the  
 book. Many residents are involved in  
 farm work. Other inhabitants commute  
 to neighbouring towns. FArms vary in  
 size from under 50acres to about      
 200acres. Houses are generally built  </content>
