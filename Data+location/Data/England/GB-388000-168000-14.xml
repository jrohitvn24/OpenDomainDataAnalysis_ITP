 Lacock is quite well served for health
 facilities.  There is a doctor's      
 surgery in the village.  Once a week  
 the health visitor holds a clinic     
 there and this has been of great help 
 to the younger families in the        
 village.  Other services, such as     
 chiropody, are available in nearby    
 Melksham and Corsham, but the nearest 
 hospital is in Chippenham.  Most of   
 the inhabitants of the village find   
 the facilities adequate, but an       
 improved bus service would improve    
 things even more for the older people 
 in the area.
