		<title>11OUR VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The majority of residents in Cliffsend
 made similar comments about life in   
 the village, the beach along the coast
 and the friendliness of their         
 neighbours.                           
{COMMENTS FOR:                         
 "The area is very picturesque because 
 of the surrounding countryside."      
{"It's a small community and everyone  
{seems to get on well with one         
{another." }                           
 "I came from London and Cliffsend is  
 so much quieter."                     
{COMMENTS AGAINST:                     
 "The Hoverport rather spoils the area 
 especially from the beach."           
{"No surgery or doctor in the village  
{and the cost of bus to Ramsgate is    
{expensive." }                         
 "The beach needs cleaning up and the  
 main road is dangerous and too busy."
