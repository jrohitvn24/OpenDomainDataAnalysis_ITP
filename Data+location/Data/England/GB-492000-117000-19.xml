 He shoes polo ponies, race horses,    
 show jumpers, hunters &amp; eventers. The 
 most dangerous horse he has shod is a 
 polo pony which he could not get hind 
 shoes on. The highest horse he has    
 shod is a Shire 17.2HH. The shoes he  
 uses are mild steel &amp; ready made. He  
 uses medium heat, enough to shape the 
 shoes. He is from Ireland. He goes out
 there sometimes for a break. He       
 decided to be a Blacksmith because a  
 jockey was his first choice &amp; love of 
 horses his second choice. He was a    
 part-time apprentice with his father  
 who was a Blacksmith. He shoes 10     
 horses a day on average, He has had
