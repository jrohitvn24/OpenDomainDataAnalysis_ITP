Entertainment in the pubs is changing. 
Some of the traditional games such as  
skittles are disappearing from the     
pubs in the area.{Skittles} is played  
on a leather topped table which is     
about waist high with a net at the     
back to stop the skittles falling on   
the floor. The skittles,called Â£pins'  
are about 15 cms high &amp; are arranged on
the table in the shape of a diamond.   
The player stands about 1 &amp; a half     
metres away &amp; throws three wooden      
disks calledÂ£ cheeses' at the pins.A   
good player will  knock down 27 pins   
with his three cheeses.It is a noisy   
game &amp; is usually played in a games    
room or in a public bar.It is being    
replaced by the American game of{pool} 
in many public houses.
