		<content> 13 Farmers work this area most farms  
 being of 50-60 acres, 4 are 200-300   
 acres and 1 of 400 acres.  All own    
 their farms but 3 rent land from the  
 water board near the resevoir.  In    
 recent years land has been sold off on
 retirement of the farmers and other   
 rents his land to 3 seperate farmers. 
 Most farms are self sufficient with   
 machinery owning on average 2-4       
 tractors of 40-80hp.  There are 4     
 combine harvesters over the whole     
 plot, with a 14ft cut contractors may 
 be called in to assist with some      
 silage making. The soil is heavy to   
 the south of the resevoir but light to
 gravelly to the west.  Sprays are used
 on the crops to guard against rust,   
 mildew and aphids.  Grass is treated  
 with fertilisers during the spring and
 summer and with manure in autumn and  
 winter.                               </content>
