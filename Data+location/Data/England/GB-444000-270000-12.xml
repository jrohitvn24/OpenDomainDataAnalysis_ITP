		<title>12THURLASTON POST OFFICE</title>
		<content>The Post Office is in the centre of    
Thurlaston and is the only shop in the 
village.Many people go to Duncurch,    
Rugby and Leamington but many still use
the village post office for small      
items.Its busiest times are Thursday   
morning and Friday evening.They order  
72 papers each Sunday,the most popular 
being "THE TIMES".                     
There is also a dry cleaning service   
which is well used.                    
The Post Office has the only post box  
in the village.                        
The people who own it have only lived  
there for a year after a long          
tradition of a local family passing it 
on.They like the village and think the 
people are friendly.                   
Some villagers come in "just for a     
chat"!
