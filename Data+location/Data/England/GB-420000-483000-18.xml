		<content> There is a bus which comes every      
 Thursday at quarter past ten.The time 
 table is at the Buck Inn where the bus
 stops for people to get on or off.It  
 takes them to Ripon via Snape.It is   
 market day in Ripon.The bus gives the 
 people time to shop before returning  
 at 3.30pm.                            
                                       
 The only other transport for public   
 use is the post-bus which comes       
 daily to Thirn and Watlass as it      
 collects the afternoon post and       
 delivers letters. It is a minibus. It 
 costs forty-five pence to go from     
 Thornton Watlass to Masham.           
                                       
 The postman collects the money and    
 gives postage stamps in return. They  
 are franked so that they cannot be    
 used again.                           
                                       </content>
