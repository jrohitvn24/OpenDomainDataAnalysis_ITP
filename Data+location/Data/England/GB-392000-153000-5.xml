 Edington and Coulston were  originally
 three villages,the eastern part of    
 Edington being Tinhead.Geographically,
 the houses are still in three groups. 
 The overall impression in all three is
 a pleasing mixture of ancient and     
 modern,with all types of material     
 used.Of course,the visitor is         
 immediately attracted to the many     
 thatched cottages,these being         
 complemented by many large            
 mansions.Dotted throughout the        
 countryside are numerous farm houses  
 with adjoining farm workers cottages. 
      To complete the picture there is 
 a cul-de-sac of some 40 houses and    
 flats belonging to the local council, 
 most of them being built between the  
 wars.Several of these have been bought
 from the council during the past 10   
 years,and improved.                   </content>
