		<content> In 16th and 17th Centuries as the     
 marsh was drained,oats and barley     
 were the chief crops.Turf was a       
 valuable asset and sold as fuel.Pota- 
 toes were successfully grown eg 1784  
 the yield was 200-300 bushels per     
 acre.Bread became the staple diet     
 about 1800,it used to be oatcake.Dairy
 farming has increased throughout the  
 last 200 years "Mosstocks" are still  
 ploughed up on the areas from which   
 peat has been taken,these are the     
 remains of prehistoric oaks.More wheat
 was grown in the 19th century. You    
 will see from the land use survey that
 most of the farmland is now in grass, 
 either grazing or for silage.There is 
 some barley grown as well as potatoes 
 (Pilling's are highly regarded in     
 Lancashire).Horticulture is in decline
 with the exception of "organically"   
 grown crops such as tomatoes.         </content>
