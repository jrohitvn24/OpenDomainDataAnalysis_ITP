		<content> In this square the land slopes        
 from                                  
 west to east with the Greenbank estate
 on one side of the St.Bees road and   
 Mirehouse in the valley.All the       
 south-western quarter consists of     
 fields with no buildings on it        
 whatsoever.There was an old coalmine  
 around but it ceased working in       
 1849.The road is known locally as     
 Wilson Pit Road and an old air shaft  
 in the field probably belonged to this
 pit.The area is honeycombed with old  
 mine workings.The Mirehouse housing   
 estate was built in stages between    
 1948 and 1956 and is almost entirely  
 council owned.
