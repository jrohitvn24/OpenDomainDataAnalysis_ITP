		<title>04Life on a Farm</title>
		<content> My dad works at Pamington Court Farm. 
 Most people think that a farm is a    
 horrible place to live and say it     
 smells.But it is great really because 
 you have all the open space and if you
 like animals you will really like it  
 as a lot of people do.Anyway Pamington
 Court Farm is kept very clean because 
 it is a dairy farm.A dairy farm is a  
 farm that produces milk.              
  During September all the calves are  
 born and sometimes you are up at      
 1 o'clock in the morning with a cow   
 that is calving.A herdsman like my    
 dad gets up at 5 o'clock to milk the  
 cows. He can have up to 100 cows to   
 milk at a time.                       
  For seven months of the year the cows
 are in the fields; for the other five 
 months they are kept inside.          
                                       
                                       </content>
