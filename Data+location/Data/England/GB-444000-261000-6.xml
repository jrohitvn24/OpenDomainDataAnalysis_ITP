		<title>06EDUCATION - A DAY IN SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Some children walk to school, but     
 others come in the family car. After  
 reading for a while we have assembly, 
 and one class talked about a farm they
 had visited. On Thursdays the vicar   
 comes to tell us a story. After       
 assembly we do spellings or maths,    
 such as adding, taking away, times and
 division. We have a computer on which 
 we take turns to use. In activities we
 do woodwork, sewing, boxcraft, clay   
 collage, painting,and gardening.      
 Woodwork is the favourite. At 10.30 we
 go out to play. Some children play    
 ball games, others play on the        
 climbing frame or with toy ponies. All
 the children stay in school for dinner
 some have a cooked meal, others bring 
 sandwiches. We sometimes watch schools
 television programmes. In music lesson
 we sing, play percussion instruments, 
 and some of us play a recorder.       </content>
