		<content>{High Wycombe}has developed alongside  
 the{River Wye}at a gap in the{Chiltern
{Hills,}29 miles from London and 26    
 miles from Oxford.In the twelfth      
 centuary it was a{market town.}Later  
 it was successively known for wool,   
 lace and the{furniture industry.      
 Today it is a centre for electronics  
 and light engineering.It is a commuter
 town,the train journey to London      
 taking 45 minutes.The{older           
{residential areas}around the town     
 centre were mainly occupied by people 
 whose families have lived there for   
 many generations although many of     
 these houses are now occupied by      
 Asians and West Indians who,since     
 1965, have grown into a substantial   
 community.Old factories and smaller   
 industrial units co-exist in this     
 area.
