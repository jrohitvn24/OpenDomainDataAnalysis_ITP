		<title>16ANGLING AT BEDGEBURY LAKE</title>
		<content>   The Great Lake has long been an     
 established coarse fishing and is     
 controlled for angling by the         
 Cranbrook &amp; District Angling Club.    
   The lake holds good quality tench,  
 roach, rudd, perch and pike, and      
 recently bream have grown in number.  
   The main method of angling is by    
 float or ledger tackle, with bread,   
 sweetcorn, maggot and worm being the  
 most common baits used.               
   The lake's large variations in depth
 allow the angler a wide variety of    
 swims to fish, from the deepest by the
 dam wall where depths of 14 feet can  
 be found to areas at the inlet end    
 with only 2 or 3 feet of water and    
 large patches of water lilies.        
   This water with its attractive      
 setting and abundance of wildlife is  
 an ideal place for the serious and    
 casual angler alike.                  </content>
