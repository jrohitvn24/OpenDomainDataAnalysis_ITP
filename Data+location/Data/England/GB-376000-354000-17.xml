{Comprehensive School.}In 1918 the     
 three classrooms with wooden floors,  
 high circled windows and fireplaces   
 contained two classes each of 45      
 pupils. It was cold and drafty. The   
 school day began with assembly        
 followed by scripture. Children sat on
 long benches, in rows facing the      
 teacher. Drill was done in the road.  
 Boys and girls had separate           
 playgrounds and went home for dinner. 
{Cranberry County Junior School}built  
 in 1975 is of open-plan design. Floors
 are carpeted, walls display children's
 work. Classes of 30-35 pupils sit in  
 groups around tables in the teaching  
 area. Homebays, attractively curtained
 are used for registration. Children   
 dine in the craft areas. The building 
 is centrally heated.                  </content>
