		<title>03THE ALMSHOUSES</title>
		<content> In our village behind the church there
 are seventeen houses - almshouses-    
 which were built in 1681. They are    
 grey stone terraced houses with fancy 
 gables and tiny gardens with rockeries
 and gravel paths and a few wooden     
 benches. They have diamond patterned  
 windows and everthing looks well cared
 for. The keys to the front doors are  
 large - about 2O cms.- old fashioned  
 and highly decorated. They belong to  
 the Port Charity but originally Sir   
 John Port left some money for them to 
 be built. Old people used to live in  
 them but at the moment, they are being
 modernised. The people should be able 
 to move back next year.
