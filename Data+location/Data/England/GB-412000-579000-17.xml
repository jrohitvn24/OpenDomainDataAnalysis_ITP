		<title>17WHALTON C of E AIDED SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Built in 1831, the school originally  
 provided education for children up to 
 age 14. In the late fifties the roll  
 reached a maximum of 65 and in 1959 it
 became a Primary School. With the     
 introduction of a three tier education
 system in 1970 it became a First      
 School. The roll fell to 15 pupils in 
 the early eighties and in consequence 
 there was a reduction from 2 full-time
 teachers to 1 full-time and 1 part    
 -time. There are now 20 pupils.       
 Rumours frequently circulate about    
 closure and this causes some parents  
 to send their children to other       
 schools exacerbating the problem of   
 falling rolls. However, 40% of the    
 children come from outside the        
 official catchment area indicating    
 that the parents of these children    
 feel that they will get a better      
 education in a small, rural school.   </content>
