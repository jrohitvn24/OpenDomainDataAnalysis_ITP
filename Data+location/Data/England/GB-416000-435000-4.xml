		<content> When we went to the{quarry}a          
 quarry worker  showed us a big        
 piece of metal which has a kind of    
{weighing scale}used for weighing      
 stone.We weighed 980 kgs.             
 altogether.Then we went to a big{pit} 
 where three or four men were          
 working.There was a{crane}which was   
 helping the men to get the stone.First
 the men hammered the hook on the crane
 into the stone then the crane lifted  
 up the{block of stone.}The men put a  
 smaller piece of stone underneath the 
 big bit of stone to help the crane    
 lift the big piece of stone.We clocked
 in which is a bit like putting down   
 time on a card by machine.One machine 
 had big circular blades.We saw the    
 blue{lagoon}which was 40 feet deep and
 the blacksmith's workshop.
