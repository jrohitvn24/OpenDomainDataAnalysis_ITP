		<title>04Wawne, modern.</title>
		<content> Modern Wawne is a mixture of old 19th 
 Century houses, farms and chapels,    
 church, a  small council and a new    
 private estate. Few residents now work
 on the land, most commute to either   
 Hull or{Beverley.                     
                                       
 There are two shops, (Post Office/    
 general store, off licence/ grocers), 
 a public house, a garage/ filling     
 station, a school and village Hall.   
                                       
 The village hall provides a thriving  
 social life for both young and old.   
 The church and chapel are regularly   
 attended by a small congregation.     
 Outside the village lies a cricket    
 field and tennis court. A new terminal
 for gas brought in from the North Sea 
 also lies outside the villge.         
 Buses run to and from the village     
 every hour at peak times.             </content>
