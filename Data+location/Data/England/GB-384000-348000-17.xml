		<title>17HOUSING SEWAGE WORKS.</title>
		<content>   The sewage works for this area are  
next to Westport Lake,and by the side  
of the Trent and Mersey Canal.         
                              In the   
sewage works there is a Press House    
which controls the works.There are     
tanks were the sewage goes,and is      
broken down and dispersed.It only takes
two men to operate the works,and they  
have a canteen and an office.The man in
charge is named Mr James,he is my      
father.We live in a house next to the  
works,and there is a lot of land around
us.We have got hens and a goat,as well 
as other pets like a dog,cats and      
ferrets.Although we are close to the   
middle of Tunstall,it is more like     
being in the country.                  
                    In 8 years the     
sewage works will close,and my father  
is going to own the land.
