		<content>{FRENCHAY BRIDGE}- was built in 1774.  
 It has had quite a lot of trouble.    
 Signs and barriers have been erected  
 and have been ignored.All the weight  
 of the traffic has caused considerable
 damage to the bridge. In the end      
 concrete bollards have been put up so 
 no traffic can get through. This is of
 great concern to Frenchay Hospital    
 as it is just around the corner and   
 emergency vehicles cannot get through.
  Some people feel very strongly about 
 change in their community.A sports    
 complex,proposed for Stoke Gifford,   
 was rejected after local people       
 protested about possible noise and    
 vandalism. {                          
{HEALTH}- There are{no hospitals}in    
 this area but a large one is at nearby
 Frenchay.                             
 There are{no doctors surgeries,}local 
 people must travel to visit a doctor. </content>
