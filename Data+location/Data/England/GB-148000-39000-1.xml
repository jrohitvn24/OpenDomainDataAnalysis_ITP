		<title>01AN INTRODUCTION TO ST.IVES.</title>
		<content>  St.Ives is a small town of 10,000    
 people in the{Penwith}district of     
 Cornwall. It lies on the north coast  
 overlooking St.Ives Bay, about 15     
 miles from Lands End. To the west lie 
 steep{cliffs}and small coves and      
 inland rise the{granite hills}of the  
 Penwith moors.                        
  The town takes its name from{St.Ia}, 
 who is said to have crossed from      
 Ireland on a leaf (coracle) in A.D.409
  The original village, with its tiny  
 cottages and narrow streets around the
 harbour and parish church, has grown  
 inland up a steep valley.             
  Originally a{fishing}village, St.Ives
 is today primarily a{holiday}resort,  
 but still retains much of its         
 character and tradition as shown in   
 its Celtic place-names and ancient    
 customs.
