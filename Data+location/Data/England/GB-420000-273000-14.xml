		<title>14VISIT TO GATE FARM</title>
		<content>     On Friday we went to Gate Farm and
 walked round and asked the farmer,Mr  
 Harvey,a few questions.Here are the   
 answers.He had 100 acres and grows    
 Barley,Oats and Grass.The cottage is  
 from 400 to 500 years old.For animal  
 stock he has cows and calves.They are 
 mostly Friesians.He has 40.The cows   
 are milked by machines.They produce   
 600 to 700 litres and it takes one    
 and a quarter hours to milk.The cows  
 are milked when they are 2.The farmer 
 does forage harvesting.The workers on 
 the farm are his family.He has some   
 old and some new machines and 3       
 tractors.We had a look at one of the  
 men milking the cows.He showed us what
 happened to the milk when it had been 
 milked.He had a hay barn,a straw barn,
 a corn store and a work shop.Also he  
 had a lot of other interesting things.
