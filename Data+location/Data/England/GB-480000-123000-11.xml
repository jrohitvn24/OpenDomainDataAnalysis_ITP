		<content> This census taken on Wednesday June   
 26th shows the amount of traffic      
 passing in half an hour from 10       
 o'clock.

 Five pedal cycles were seen and one   
 tractor going south.                  
 Two pedestrians went into the shop.   
 Most of the vehicles were going west  
 to Petersfield.                       
 This road the A272 was once a stage   
 coach route, I expect there were more 
 people about then.                    </content>
