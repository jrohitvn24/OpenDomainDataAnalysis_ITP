		<title>18GRAVEL QUARRYING (CONT.)</title>
		<content>About 1000 tons a week is produced.    
Durite is exported to America and other
countries.                             
 As a result of the quarrying there is 
about 1 square mile of lake area which 
is stocked with fish and run by the    
Canterbury and District Angling        
Association. A sailing club also makes 
use of the resultant lakes. As the     
lakes and surrounding marshy areas have
become colonized they have become      
havens for wildlife. One important     
local breeding bird is the Cettis      
Warbler which has increased in numbers 
because of the ideal habitat created. A
site near to the Frank Montgomery      
School is being reclaimed for the      
formation of a small golf course.
