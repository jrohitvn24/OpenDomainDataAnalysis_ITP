		<content> The two railway stations closed in the
 early sixties.In 1985 public bus      
 services from Penrith ceased. This has
 left a once weekly service to         
 Kendal(Braithwaites)and a daily       
 bus,Primrose, from Newcastle to       
 Blackpool.The complete closure of the 
 Carlisle to Settle railway line, which
 has occasional weekend trains is      
 imminent.Private transport is now     
 almost essential. There has been an   
 improvement in the road network. The  
 M6 is 15 minutes away at Tebay on the 
 modernised A685 and the A66 gives good
 east west links.                      
   Coach or "bus traffic" between the  
 north east and Blackpool has decreased
 in recent years. Public demands for a 
 town car park are frequently voiced.  
 Popular opinion wants it sited in     
 Faraday Rd. A by-pass  planned to the 
 west has no definite starting date.   </content>
