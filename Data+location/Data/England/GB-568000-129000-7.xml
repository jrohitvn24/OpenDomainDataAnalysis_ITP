  Outside it was snowing but inside the
 heat and warmth glowed out of the     
 frosted windows. Cheers and shouts    
 drowned the noise outside of a car    
 beeping its horn angrily. As she      
 walked her stiletto heels echoed on   
 the wooden floor. She glanced at the  
 audience. Two children were in the    
 front row. Behind them sat their      
 parents. Dad in a long coat, mum      
 watching silently. The lady pulled up 
 her flowing skirt and sat gracefully  
 down. A little child at the back stood
 on a chair in an effort to see.       
  She picked up her music case and the 
 black notes on the carved piano       
 blurred from view. As she lifted her  
 fingers her ring slipped down a       
 little. Then she struck the keyboard. 
 The room was silent except for music. </content>
