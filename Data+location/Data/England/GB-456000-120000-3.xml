		<content> This chalk downland is mainly arable  
 farmland. Downleaze copse is a 34     
 acres area of ancient woodland. Half  
 of which is still retained under      
 coppice management and half has been  
 replanted with conifers.St. Clair's   
 Farm and Franklin Farm have planted   
 conifer shelter belts for game        
 shooting and cattle.Some of Stephen   
 Castle Down has recently been ploughed
 up, retaining a smaller area for      
 gallops.                              
 More hedges have been destroyed by Old
 Man's Beard than by farmers'          
 bulldozers .                          
 Roe deers' numbers have increased and 
 do much damage to trees and are a     
 hazard to traffic.
