		<title>03WINGERWORTH FOR THE ELDERLY</title>
		<content>  We talked to a villager who has lived
 in Wingerworth for 30 years. In that  
 time she has seen the building of     
 schools, shops, houses, footpaths and 
 street lights.                        
  She likes the village because of the 
 people who live here, the open space, 
 the Lido, the parks, the shops and    
 the Parish Rooms.                     
  There is a club for the{'Over 60's'  
 which meets once a week for a hot meal
 in the Parish Rooms. Dominoes and     
 other games and outings are also      
 organised for the members.            
  She does think that, with all the new
 houses being built, the village is    
 getting too big, she certainly doesn't
 want the Green Belt land to be built  
 on.                                   
  She would like to have a permanent   
 library to use, and a medical centre  
 built.                                </content>
