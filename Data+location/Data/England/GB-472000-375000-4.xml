		<title>04FARMING IN ASKHAM</title>
		<content>  Manor Farm is about 200 acres in     
 size,a third of which is down to      
 grass,the remainder for growing       
 cereals. There are 60 British Friesian
 in the herd and 60 other cattle bred  
 for herd replacements or for beef.The 
 cows each average 6,300 litres of milk
 a year.Recently imposed quotas will   
 force this to be reduced.  In winter  
 the cows are fed on a compound dairy  
 feed and grass silage.They live in a  
 covered yard until spring when they   
 are turned out to graze on grass. In  
 late spring the grass is cut and baled
 to conserve it.  The cereals grown are
 winter wheat and winter barley,       
 producing an average of 3 tonnes of   
 grain per acre. The crop rotation is  
 grass, grass, w. wheat, wheat w.barley
 w.barley.(6). Manure is spread on the 
 grass in the 2nd.year and ploughed in 
 before the first winter wheat crop.   </content>
