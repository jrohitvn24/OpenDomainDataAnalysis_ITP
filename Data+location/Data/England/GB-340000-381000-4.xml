		<title>04SPEKE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE.....</title>
		<content> When Speke housing estate was built in
 the  1930's, an industrial  estate was
 built next to it,  to give jobs to its
 people.   Today  some of the factories
 have  closed  down  but we  still have
 Fords-cars, Glaxo-drugs, Bryant &amp; May-
 matches  and   Dunlops-rubber  amongst
 others.Soon Speke Enterprise Zone will
 open, hopefully bringing more jobs and
 factories.                            
  Dunlops Factory...                   
     ..This is one of the oldest in the
 area. The factory once made aeroplanes
 but was bought by Dunlops in 1948.They
 make  rubber  goods such as golfballs,
 sports shoes, tyres for cars,   buses,
 tractors and aeroplanes.     Today the
 Speke  Factory  makes  rubber  belting
 which   is   used  in  escalators  and
 conveyor belts.
