		<title>06Mrs.Lomas-Changing Times</title>
		<content>   Mrs. Lomas' family have farmed in   
 the Cumwhinton area for 150 years. The
 farmhouse that she lives in was built 
 in the year 1600. Mrs. Lomas is 72    
 years old and attended Cumwhinton     
 School.She recalls that not too long  
 ago the cows were milked by hand , the
 land worked by horses and the milk was
 taken away in churns. Now there are   
 milking machines ,tractors do all the 
 work and the milk is collected by bulk
 tankers. Like many of the Cumbrian    
 farms of the past her farm is very    
 small by present standards, only 52   
 acres. Most of the farms in this part 
 of the country were between 50 and 100
 acres but now there are fewer though  
 larger units.                         
   Mrs.Lomas spends her leisure time at
 flower shows, cattle markets and      
 watching television programmes about  
 farming.                              </content>
