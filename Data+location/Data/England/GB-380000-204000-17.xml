		<title>17NOTABLE EVENTS - WEST STROUD</title>
		<content> The main notable event affecting      
 community life in our area in 1985 is 
 the huge row that has occurred over   
 the re-organisation of secondary      
 education.  Stroud has always had two 
 Grammar Schools, Marling School for   
 boys and Stroud High School for girls.
 There are also four other secondary   
 schools.  Selection for these schools 
 is unfairly distributed causing great 
 disappointment to many families.  This
 year, the Education Secretary         
 announced the planned closure of the  
 two Grammar Schools, so that all      
 secondary schools in the area will be 
 eleven to sixteen comprehensive       
 schools with a sixth form college on  
 the site of the 'Grammar' schools.    
 At the present time this issue is     
 still unresolved and much opposition  
 to the plan still exists.
