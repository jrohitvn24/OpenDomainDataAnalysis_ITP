		<content>                                       
     Whittington is a hamlet to the    
south of Kinver lying between the      
canal and the A449 road. There is a    
canal lock, a post office, public      
house, garage, horticultural nursery,  
sewage works and Whittington Hall.     
     Whittington Hall was built in the 
reign of George 2nd on the site of an  
earlier house. It is built of red      
bricks.                                
     The inn is called the Â£Dick       
Whittington'. It used to be            
Whittington Manor House and dates from 
1310. Parts of the half-timbering and  
wattle and daub remain. On the front   
door is an emblem showing Queen Anne   
stayed there. There is a priest's hole.
There is supposed to be a secret       
staircase leading to a room where King 
Charles 2nd hid after the Battle of    
Worcester but it has not been found yet</content>
