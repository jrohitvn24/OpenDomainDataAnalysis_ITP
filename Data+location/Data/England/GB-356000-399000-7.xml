		<content> Our school is called Nicol Mere County
 Primary School.  It got the name      
 'Nicol' because when the sun shone    
 down on the mere, it looked like      
 nickle.  The school has two buildings,
 the infants and the juniors.  It has  
 about five hundred children and has   
 fourteen classes.  The school is      
 situated near Roman Road.  The road   
 got its name because there used to    
 be a Roman road running next to it.   
 It has now got lots of houses on it,  
 mainly old people's houses.  There is 
 a playing field around the School.
