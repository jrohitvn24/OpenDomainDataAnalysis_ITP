		<title>14GAMES CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content> In different parts of the world the   
 same games are being played like:     
 hopscotch, rounders, Queenie Queenie, 
 British bulldog, cat and mouse and    
 skipping. Here are 2 games we play    
 at Aldborough:                        
 Hopscotch- you start the game by      
 throwing a stone on No.1 and you hop  
 and jump to the highest number and    
 come all the way back again to pick up
 your stone.Then start again on No.2.  
 If you don't get the stone on No.2    
 you have to put your stone back on    
 No.2 and you let somebody else have a 
 go. Not many boys play hopscotch.     
 Skipping- it is a very easy game-all  
 you need is a longish rope then you   
 get two people to hold the ends and   
 turn it.You jump in the middle and    
 sing some songs.
