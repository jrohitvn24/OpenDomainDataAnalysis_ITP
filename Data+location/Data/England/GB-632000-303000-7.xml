		<content> When Sir Thomas de Kerdeston died in  
 1446,it was decided that he died not  
 possessed of Claxton and other        
 manors,and that William de la Pole,was
 the heir so that Elizabeth,the        
 daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas    
 lost her inheritance.Edmund de la     
 Pole in the 12th century granted her  
 several Norfolk manors.Claxton passed 
 to Thomas Howard,Earl of Surrey.Then  
 according to Blomefield,on the death  
 of the Duchess of Norfolk,this        
 Lordship was granted to Charles       
 Brandon.It is referred to several     
 times in the Paston Letters and there 
 is a tradition that Anne of Cleves,the
 dispised wife of Henry VIII,not only  
 owned Claxton Castle but lived there  
 for a time.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
