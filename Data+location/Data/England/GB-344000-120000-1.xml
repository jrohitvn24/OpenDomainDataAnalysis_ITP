		<title>01     ASH DISTRICT</title>
		<content> Our Domesday block covers the village 
 of Ash and the small hamlets of Coat, 
 Milton and Witcombe. The few houses   
 around Stapleton Cross are included   
 and so are the housing estates nearer 
 Martock.  Some of these houses are    
 council houses while the others are   
 privately built.  Only a few people   
 live in our area as most of the land  
 is used for farming.  The main kind of
 farming is dairy farming but there is 
 at least one pig farm.  There is no   
 heavy industry but there is an        
 industrial estate of abouttwenty five 
 firms situated on the site of the old 
 Martock/Yeovil railway line.  Some of 
 these firms are trading companies     
 while others make different things.   
 Ash Primary School provides the       
 education in our area.
