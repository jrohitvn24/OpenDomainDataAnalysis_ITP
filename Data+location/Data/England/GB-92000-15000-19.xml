		<title>19HOMELIFE ON ST.MARTINS I.O.S</title>
		<content>   My family own a flower farm and two 
 holiday cottages which are let out in 
 the tourist season.My Dad and my adult
 brother run the farm,and my Mum looks 
 after the goats which provide our     
 milk,and cleans the cottages.In the   
 flower season when my parents are     
 busy,I have to put the soup on to cook
 or I take my dinner down to my Mum,if 
 she is too busy bunching the flowers. 
 But when my big sister is home from   
 college on the minland she cooks the  
 meals.In the summer my Mum goes to    
 the main island every Thursday to get 
 the weekly shopping,because of the    
 limited supplies in the island shop.We
 order most of our clothes from        
 catalogues.My Dad likes walking.My    
 Mum,sister,brother and I all like     
 reading for our hobby.On Sundays in   
 the summer we usually go walking or we
 go to the beach for a pinnic and swim.</content>
