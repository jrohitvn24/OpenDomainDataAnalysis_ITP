		<title>05Redevelopment in Manchester</title>
		<content>  In the inner city areas of Manchester
 e.g. Ardwick, Beswick, Gorton and     
 Bradford there is a high density of   
 population. These areas have          
 experienced a great deal of change    
 over the last 20 years and serve to   
 illustrate the various policies that  
 have been tried to solve the problem  
 of housing in our cities. Nearly all  
 the original housing stock has been   
 replaced and recently some of the     
 earlier redevelopment sites are hoping
 to have redevelopment agencies e.g.   
 "Fort Beswick". In these areas the    
 social problems resulting from high   
 density living, as well as the        
 structural problems of the blocks,    
 have led to the Council to demolish   
 them and think again.                 
  More recent schemes have learnt from 
 past mistakes and many  semi-detached 
 and terraced houses are being built.  </content>
