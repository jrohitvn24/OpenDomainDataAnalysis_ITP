		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO WARMINSTER</title>
		<content> Warminster is a country town of about 
 15000 people, lying between the       
 rolling woods of Longleat and the     
 dramatic chalk scenery of the western 
 escarpment of Salisbury Plain.        
                                       
 The town has few natural resources so 
 it has only light industry, but it is 
 a busy shopping and service centre for
 surrounding villages. Other sources of
 employment are the various military   
 facilities, and increasing tourism.   
                                       
 The centre is almost unchanged from   
 the 18th and 19th centuries, but since
 the 1960s the town has become popular 
 as a residential area, especially for 
 retirement, with several new estates  
 on the outskirts. Traffic from 5 major
 roads, which at present runs through  
 the town, will be diverted by a       
 by-pass after 1987.                   </content>
