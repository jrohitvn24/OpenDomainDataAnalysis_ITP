 Distinctive features of our area are  
 the airfield,  the old Hospital site  
 and the Industrial Estate. They were  
 used in World War Two. They are made  
 up of old wartime buildings. After the
 war there was no further use for those
 buildings so they were left to stand  
 empty and fall into disrepair. Now the
 Industrial Estate is used as a garage 
 for mechanics and carpenters. Also    
 small businesses such as Fence-making 
 and Garden Shed construction are      
 housed there.Old hangars which were   
 part of R.A.F.Tern Hill are used as a 
 Sports Centre and also as storage     
 depots for potatoes. The old Hospital 
 Site is used for housing pigs and     
 straw.
