		<content>Chamberlain Crescent: all these houses 
started as council houses, built in the
early 1950's. All are semi-detached.   
Most have been bought by the occupiers.
Cavendish Way: these houses were built 
in the early 1930's and were owner-oc- 
cupied from the beginning. They are all
semi-detached, but have no garages.    
Some have coloured leaded lights.      
Grosvenor Road: many of these houses   
were built around 1900. They are mostly
small. Some of their windows have col- 
oured leaded lights.                   
Kent Rd and North Rd: all the houses   
along North Rd and some along Kent Rd  
were built in the late 1880's. They are
very small and have little or no gar-  
den. These houses are owner-occupied.  
St David's Close and High Broom Cres.: 
these houses were built in the 1960's. 
Some are town houses, others detached.
