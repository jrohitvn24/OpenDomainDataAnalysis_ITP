		<title>17ANIMALS IN LITTONDALE</title>
		<content>   Rabbits are the most numerous of the
 animals in the Dale, but one unusual  
 feature is the number of pure black   
 wild rabbits.  A few hares can still  
 be found.  Moles are obviously        
 numerous, though rarely seen, whilst  
 foxes are still sometimes seen about  
 in daytime.                           
   Many small animals, such as shrews, 
 voles, dormice and fieldmice, exist in
 quite considerable numbers, as do     
 rats. Hedgehogs and grey squirrels are
 fairly common.                        
   Although there used to be many deer 
 in Littondale, now only an odd one is 
 seen on very rare occaions.  It is    
 also a long time since badgers were   
 seen in the Dale.                     
   The main predators, apart from      
 foxes, are stoats, weasels, and       
 recently a few mink have invaded the  
 Dale.                                 </content>
