		<title>12YOUNG CHORISTER AT DURHAM</title>
		<content> Mark Frankham is a probationer in{    
{Durham Cathedral Choir}and he boards  
 at the Choir School nearby.His        
 thirteen hour day is very involved.   
 Prayers are said before breakfast,in  
 the Assembly Hall,and after breakfast 
 the choristers begin their musical    
 day.School lessons begin at half past 
 nine and continue until three forty.  
 The choristers practise again and then
 sing Evensong.Half an hours' homework 
 follows high tea and the day finishes 
 at eight forty-five.                  
  Mark states that boarding makes him  
 feel very grown-up and independent.   
  He enjoys the{musical devotion}given 
 by the choir,but the best thing to    
 look forward to is when his parents   
 visit him.                            
  He thoroughly enjoys his new life    
 with all of the activities.
