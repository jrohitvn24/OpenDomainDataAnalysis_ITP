		<title>15Hemerdon Village.</title>
		<content>   The centre of the village is at a   
 road junction. On one corner is Stert 
 Farm. On the opposite corner are some 
 old cottages which used to be miners' 
 cottages. Also at this junction are   
 three bungalows and a drive leading to
 Hemerdon Farm. There is a bench,      
 telephone box, a tap and a waste bin. 
   We walked down the lane past the    
 cottages. We saw a large house built  
 in 1930 and next to it was a field for
 grazing and a hay field which was     
 being cut. A little farther on we came
 to Windwhistle Farm which specialises 
 in rearing pigs.                      
   Back in Hemerdon we followed Galva  
 Road passing "The Miners' Arms" which 
 has a children's play area. There are 
 a number of attractive old cottages.  
   There is no shop or school in       
 Hemerdon. The children go to Sparkwell
 School.               Johanna Stidson.</content>
