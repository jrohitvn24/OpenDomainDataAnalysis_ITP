		<content> WHEN WE WENT TO ST.NICHOLAS'S CHURCH  
 ACROSS THE ROAD WE FOUND OUT IT WAS   
 RESTORED IN 1703. SOME PARTS ARE      
 THIRTEENTH CENTURY AND THE WINDOWS ARE
 FIFTEENTH CENTURY. WHEN WE WENT IN I  
 SAW FRESCOES WHICH ARE PAINTINGS ON   
 WALLS.ON ONE OF THE WALLS THERE WERE  
 PLANKS OF WOOD AND ON THEM WAS        
 WRITING.INSTEAD OF USING AN "S" IN    
 THE WRITING THEY USED AN "F". THERE   
 WAS A TOMB OF RICHARD POWLETT,THE     
 COLOURS WERE FAINT. YEARS AGO THEY    
 WOULD HAVE BEEN BRIGHTER THAN THEY ARE
 NOW. I HOPE MORE PEOPLE WILL USE THE  
 CHURCH IN THE FUTURE. THERE WAS A     
 VISITORS BOOK AND MRS.LETCHER SIGNED  
 THE TEACHERS NAMES AND JASON SIGNED   
 FROM LAVERSTOKE SCHOOL.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
