		<title>01LANDSCAPE, EAST BARKWITH</title>
		<content>    This block covers an undulating    
 landscape, rising from a height of 40 
 metres above sea-level in the south   
 west, to some 80 metres in the east.  
 The higher land is part of the {      
{Lincolnshire Wolds,}which are chalk,  
 over-lying sandstone, with glacial    
 outwash of sand and clays to the west.
    Two villages,{East Barkwith} and { 
{South Willingham,}are included in the 
 area, with parts of the parishes of   
 East Torrington, Benniworth and       
 Hainton.                              
    The area is agricultural,          
 predominantly arable. The woodlands   
 are deciduous, and were planted as fox
 coverts, or as amenity woodland       
 associated with Panton Hall, now      
 demolished, or Hainton Hall.
