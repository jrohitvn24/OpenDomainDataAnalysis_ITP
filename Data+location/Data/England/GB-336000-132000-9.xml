		<content>   Middlezoy Community Playing Field is
 quite big but does not have many      
 facilities. It has only got goal posts
 and some slides and bars for children 
 under 8 to climb. It has also got an  
 unfinished village hall which has     
 taken 2 years to get as far as it has.
 Some children play on an old tractor  
 which has been left there. Some boys  
 have tried to make a B.M.X. course but
 it has been wrecked.  There has been  
 some trouble with vandalism which has 
 helped to delay completion of the     
 hall.                                 
 There is a cricket pitch in the middle
 where the cricket team plays. The     
 village school also uses the field    
 for sporting activities.
