		<content> Piers Chappell was born on the 7th    
 June 1975.He moved to Great Barford   
 when he was two and started to develop
 pains in his stomach when he was four.
 It was cancer.Throughout his illness  
 he showed great courage and spirit.He 
 died on the 12th January 1985.        
 At his funeral were many of his school
 friends,teachers and his doctor.      
 Perhaps the most moving moment was    
 when his favourite music,"Chariots of 
 Fire"was played.                      
 The vicar,a friend of Piers,said at   
 the funeral,"For his immense courage  
 and undying spirit,he will live in our
 hearts for ever."                     
 At the present time,pupils at Alban   
 School have raised about Â£4000 for a  
 National Childrens Cancer Research    
 Fund in his memory.
