		<title>17The Future</title>
		<content>5R's fourth years have had their ideas 
for the future.We think transport will 
change, because petroleum is declining.
We also think computers will take over 
jobs,and in the process bring a rise in
unemployment &amp; waves of crime,vandalism
&amp; possibly a civil war.Nuclear weapons 
will also change a few said they would 
rise and the rest either didn't know or
thought they would decline.Food could  
change and be bought in packets.The    
population will grow maybe merging     
towns &amp; cities.Wildlife will die       
because of polution &amp; the squeeze of   
cities.Man will live on the moon &amp;     
under the water.medicines will change  
and give a stop to main diseases.      
If there is no future you will not be
