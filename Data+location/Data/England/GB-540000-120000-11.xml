		<title>11THE PUBS OF NEWICK</title>
		<content> The pubs of Newick are all old and    
 very attractive buildings.            
 The Bull, on the Green, was built in  
 1510 and used originally as a resting 
 place for pilgrims. By 1793, it had   
 been known by the various names of the
 Hatch, the Crown and the Bull and     
 Butcher. As all good old buildings    
 should, it claims to have its resident
 ghost - an orange cat!                
 The Crown Hotel dates from 1820, when 
 it was a coaching inn on the main     
 London to Lewes road. The stables are 
 still at the back.                    
 The Royal Oak dates from the 16th     
 century and has the tradition of being
 the manor house, where manorial courts
 were held. It did not become an ale   
 house until 1890.                     
 The Bricklayers' Arms is possibly of  
 Tudor origin and was a brickworks     
 until it became a beerhouse.          </content>
