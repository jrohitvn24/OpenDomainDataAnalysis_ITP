		<title>02MY NEIGHBOURHOOD.</title>
		<content>    I have lived in my three bedroomed 
 semi detached house all my life and I 
 like it very much. The roads are very 
 quiet so we can play rounders. We     
 sometimes play in our gardens because 
 they are quite large. Most of our     
 neighbours are quite old but they are 
 nice. There is a cricket field near us
 where we sometimes have picnics.      
 There is a station near us and two    
 pubs. There are squash courts, bowling
 greens and tennis courts. One of my   
 neighbours has an air raid shelter in 
 his back garden.
