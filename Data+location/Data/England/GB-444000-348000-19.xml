		<title>19Farms</title>
		<content> There are quite a few farms in our    
 area and they vary from arable farming
 to pigs,cattle.We at school are very  
 friendly with the local farmers and   
 often visit their farms in connection 
 with work  we are doing in school.Some
 of our farms have quite a history,for 
 example it is said that Charles 1st   
 slept at Manor Hall Farm and there is 
 a seventeenth century grave stone     
 their.Alan Wright,who owns Allandale  
 farm (a pig farm) is a great friend of
 the school,his children come here and 
 he is very much involved with the life
 and work of the community.While we    
 have been doing the Domesday project  
 all the local farmers have  welcomed  
 us on to their land.Our school        
 playground looks out over the         
 neighbouring countryside and we can   
 see the various fields and for what   
 they are being used.                  </content>
