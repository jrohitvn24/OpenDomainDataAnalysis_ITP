		<content> The Sleaford-Spalding railway line    
 runs from North East to South West,   
 also the Sleaford-Boston line, reduced
 to single line with automatic barriers
 in 1982, in the north. Mainly         
 agricultural, growing cereals, sugar  
 beet, oilseed rape and potatoes. there
 are seven farm holdings in the area   
 and also three poultry rearing units. 
 Burton Pedwardine has a small church  
 but the school has closed. The        
 population of the village and         
 surrounding area work on the land or  
 travel to Sleaford or other nearby    
 towns to work using private vehicles  
 or the once a day bus. Like most      
 villages in the area Burton has       
 problems with farming due to mud on   
 the roads, straw burning and noise    
 from explosive bird scarers even      
 though there are laws and bylaws      
 regulating the nuisances.             </content>
