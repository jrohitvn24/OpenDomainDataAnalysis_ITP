		<title>02CASTLE AS TOURIST ATTRACTION</title>
		<content> The castle has been the focus of      
 Portchester ever since it was built by
 the Romans about 285 AD.  It was built
 as the most westerly of the Saxon     
 Shore Forts designed to protect the   
 South-Eastern coast from Saxon raids. 
 Nowadays, the castle is a tourist     
 attraction for people from far and    
 wide.  The most visited part of the   
 castle is the castle grounds,         
 surrounded by the finest Roman walls  
 in North Western Europe.  Apart from  
 the tourism aspect, the grounds are   
 also used for recreational purposes,  
 such as sunbathing, dog walking,      
 fishing and various ball games.       
 Also in the grounds is the Norman     
 village church, also a popular tourist
 attraction.
