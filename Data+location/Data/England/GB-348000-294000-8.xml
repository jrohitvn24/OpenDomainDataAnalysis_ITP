		<content>    I work in the parish producing     
 hardwood furniture of simple and      
 attractive design. I season the trees 
 myself so can buy most of my raw      
 materials from surrounding farms and  
 woodlands. All furniture is madeto    
 order. I supply local pubs - elm and  
 oak lend themselves admirably being   
 rugged but attractive. Local churches 
 and village halls are also regular    
 customers. My work ranges from        
 repairing and constructing gates, to  
 more intricate work - kitchen and shop
 fitting, using power and hand tools in
 about equal proportions.              
    Geographically,Cardington is       
 centrally located-most orders are     
 local but a fair number are from      
 further afield. I work mainly on my   
 own but have a young apprentice 3 days
 a week and my wife helps with the     
 clerical work.                        </content>
