		<content>      On the east side of Sedbergh is  
 one of the main residential areas of  
 the town, namely{Maryfell}- a typical 
 council housing estate consisting of  
 identical rows of grey houses and     
 three storey flats with small grass   
 areas fronting on to the road.        
     {Sedbergh Primary School}next to  
 the estate was built to a very modern 
 design with the classrooms and hall   
 having a steeply sloping roof to one  
 side, the remaining parts of the      
 building having a flat roof which is  
 constantly leaking despite numerous   
 repairs. On the same beautifully      
 situated campus is{Settlebeck High    
{School}which must be one of the       
 smallest high schools in the country, 
 the number of pupils on roll this year
 (11 to 16) exceeding 200 for the very 
 first time.                           
                                       </content>
