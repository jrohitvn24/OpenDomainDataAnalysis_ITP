		<content>The increasing use of Wells Harbour is 
threatened by silting. The main cause  
of this silting is a reduction in the  
flow of water past the quay and in the 
main channel on the ebb tide. The flow 
comes from the many creeks of the marsh
which fill on the flood tide.          
Recently the incoming tide has eroded  
two channels which lead directly to the
marsh area GR.9244. As a consequence on
the ebb much less water flows past the 
quay and down the main channel and     
fails to scour out the silt.           
In 1985 a project by the Harbour       
Commissioners and the Manpower Services
commission is blocking off these two   
bypaSS channels and forcing all the    
water to enter and, more importantly,  
leave past the quay  and down the main 
channel route.
