		<title>08Transport in Tiverton area</title>
		<content> We do not have very good public       
 transport.  There are Devon           
 General buses which                   
 are the cheapest type but they are    
 uncomfortable.  Other Bus companies   
 such as Kingdom's Coaches can provide 
 hired transport.  They often get used 
 by sports clubs etc.  There are       
 a few train services which stop at    
 Tiverton Junction but this seven miles
 away from the town centre!  The town  
 has some taxis as well but it is      
 expensive to keep using them.  Quite a
 lot of people have cars of their own  
 and a lot of the older boys have motor
 bikes.
