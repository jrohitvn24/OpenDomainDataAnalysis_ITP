		<content>   A typical school day starts off at  
 8 o'clock, if you don't have to do a  
 paper round. After getting dressed its
 into the kitchen for breakfast for    
 those who don't watch T.V. (and 50%   
 don't). If you don't catch the school 
 bus things are not so bad but the     
 buses leave between 8 o'clock and     
 8.20am. So they have to rush a bit.   
 The bus people (10%) arrive about     
 8.30am. with the 'locals' arriving at 
 school about 8.50am. After assembly   
 the work begins with 8 lessons -      
 usually arranged in doubles -. There  
 is a break in the morning but not in  
 the afternoon. Maths and English take 
 up more time than other subjects and  
 we're glad when its 3.45pm. We still  
 have meals provided on the premises   
 but the junior schools do not.        
   Home again we have to do homework   
 before we can go and watch T.V.       </content>
