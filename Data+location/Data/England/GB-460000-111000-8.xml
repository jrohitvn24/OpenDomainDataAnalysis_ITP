		<title>08NEWTOWN CHURCH</title>
		<content> Newtown church was built in 1849 of   
 flint and stone with pointed lancet   
 windows designed by John Colson and   
 cost Â£1,500, paid by William Garnier  
 of Rookesbury Park, Wickham, who also 
 contributed Â£1,300 to the vicarage    
 which was built in 1852. It remained a
 separate parish until it was united   
 with Soberton in 1953. Dedicated to   
 St.Paul originally, but changed to the
 Holy Trinity in 1880. Contains seats  
 for 120 people in an ecclesiastical   
 parish of 800. Contrary to current    
 trends, numbers attending family      
 communion have risen over the last few
 decades, averaging 40-50 each Sunday. 
 There is a two-manual organ, tonally  
 well-suited to the accoustics of the  
 building and a choir of 28,           
 comprising of 12 adults &amp; 16 children.
 In a 4 week month, a total of ll      
 services are held in the church.      </content>
