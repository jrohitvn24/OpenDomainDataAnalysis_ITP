		<title>09RUSKINGTON'S POLICEMAN</title>
		<content>          THE LOCAL POLICE             
    Our local policeman                
 has been in the force for five and a  
 half years.He went to the recent pit  
 strike,altogether he went to 25 pits  
 in 7 counties.He  has never           
 fired a gun on the street,but he has  
 fired a magnum 317 at a target.A P.c'.
  duty is to keep the peace,detect     
 and prevent the crime and work with   
 the community,schools,the parish      
 councils and youth groups.Headquarters
 never send a policeman more than 15   
 minutes away.The Ruskington station   
 only owns one car and has cones,      
 warning boards,first aid kit,a tape   
 measure,a brief case of paper work, a 
 shovel and a bright lamp.It takes two 
 years to become a policeman.You have a
 ten week course to start,then five two
 week courses over the two years       
 probation.                            </content>
