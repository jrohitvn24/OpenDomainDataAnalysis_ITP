		<title>15 POPULATION OF KENNINGTON</title>
		<content> In Kennington, the approximate number 
 of dwellings today in 1985 is four    
 thousand. The average amount of people
 in a house in{KENNINGTON}is two point 
 four-sevenths. Taking both figures    
 into consideration, the population of 
 the {KENNINGTON}area is 9,880. In the{
{KENNINGTON} area one half ofthe       
 population are adults, one third are  
 children and one and one sixth are old
 age pensioners (people over 60 or 65).
 A large proportion of working adults  
 commute to other areas for work. (An  
 adult is considered to be an adult    
 when he or she is over the age of     
 eighteen). The majority of houses are 
 lived in by relatively young couples  
 with young children.
