		<title>20TRANSPORT CANALS.</title>
		<content>   Roughly through the middle of the   
block runs the Trent and Mersey Canal. 
It was designed by James Brindley,who  
lived in North Staffordshire,and was   
originally opened in 1777.It was also  
called the Grand Trunk Canal,because it
linked the waterways of the country at 
the time.                              
        It was a very busy canal in its
hayday,but now it is only used for     
recreation mainly.People use the canal 
for boating holidays,fishing or just   
walking or running along the towpath.In
Longport by the canal there are two    
public houses,their names are The      
Packhorse and The Duke of Bridgewater  
they are both named after things       
connected with the canal.Packhorses    
were used to carry goods from the canal
to the factories,and the Duke of       
Bridgewater provided the money for the 
first canal.                           </content>
