		<title>19The Victoria Hall.</title>
		<content>   The main hall was built in l897 to  
 commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of    
 Queen Victoria. Two small halls were  
 added in 1906. An annexe was added 5  
 years ago and houses the Citizens     
 Advice Bureau and the registrar of    
 Births, Deaths and Marriages. The hall
 is fully used by the local community  
 and is important to the life of the   
 village.                              
   It is used by a variety of clubs    
 from Dog Training to a Model Yacht    
 club. Sports clubs from Badminton     
 to Table Tennis use the hall.The back 
 hall is used to accomodate volunteers 
 working on the canal. English classes 
 are held for Belgian students in the  
 main hall.                            
   The Ash Playmakers use the hall for 
 their rehearsals and also for putting 
 on productions especially a pantomime 
 at Christmas time.                    </content>
