		<content>{Collop Monday}takes place the day     
 before Pancake Tuesday.On this day    
 children set off from their homes     
 armed with paper bags,ready to hold   
 the sweets that shopkeepers give      
 them.This tridition is now only kept  
 by one local shopkeeper Mrs. Woodhead 
 who has happy memories of the custom  
 when she was a young girl.The custom  
 began originally when farmers used to 
 give collops (slices) of bacon to     
 children.                             
{Sheep Fairs}:every September,the      
 annual sheep fair is held in Meltham  
 in the Co-operative Croft,at the time 
 of the Meltham Feast.At one time      
 there used to be stalls in the Market 
 Place,and it was a holiday,but today  
 it is remembered only by the sheep    
 fair,the September holiday being taken
 at Honley Feast.
