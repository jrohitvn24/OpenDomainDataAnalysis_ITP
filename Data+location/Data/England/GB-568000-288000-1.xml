		<title>01FELTWELL, A NORFOLK VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   Feltwell lies near where{Norfolk}   
{Suffolk}and{Cambridgeshire}meet.      
   Built on a line of springs where the
 low chalk hills of{Breckland}slope to 
 meet the black peaty soils of the {   
{Fens,}the village has grown from its  
 Saxon beginnings to its present       
 population of around 4000. Feltwell   
 folk don't owe allegiance to any large
 town, having Thetford, (14 miles)     
 King's Lynn, (21 miles) Downham Market
 (13 miles) Ely, (19 miles) and Bury   
 St. Edmunds (28 miles) all to hand.   
   A real mix of people live in the    
 village - Farmers, industrial workers 
 and service personell. R.A.F. Feltwell
 now houses American airmen and this   
 has quite an influence on the nature  
 of the village.                       
   People like to live here, many on   
 new estates, although some complain of
 lack of amenities.                    </content>
