		<title>01Introduction To Our Area.</title>
		<content> Our area is near the southern coast of
 Cornwall. The villages around us are  
 called Trewoon, Lanjeth and High      
 Street. Our School is on the outskirts
 of the town called St. Austell. It is 
 mainly surrounded by countryside. This
 area is only a few miles away from the
 sea and many local people enjoy going 
 to the beach for recreation. The area 
 around us is very rural and contains  
 many farms in and around the villages.
 There are many country lanes and      
 footpaths to explore which gives many 
 people the opportunity to enjoy the   
 countryside. Many local people are    
 employed in the huge China Clay       
 Industry which surrounds this area.   
 Quite a few people are involved with  
 tourism because this area is quite    
 popular with holidaymakers. Most of   
 the farms are quite small because the 
 land is quite undulating. (Mike Yates)</content>
