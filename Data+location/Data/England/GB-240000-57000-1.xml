		<content>{SALTASH}IS SITUATED IN SOUTH EAST     
 CORNWALL.IT IS A BORDER TOWN SEPARATED
 FROM DEVON BY THE RIVER TAMAR.        
   THE POPULATION OF SALTASH HAS GROWN 
 VERY RAPIDLY.THE 1961 CENSUS SHOWS THE
 POPULATION AT 7425,1971 SHOWS 9926 AND
 1981 SHOWS 12960.IT IS NOW ESTIMATED  
 TO BE 15000.THE REASON FOR THE RAPID  
 EXPANSION WAS THE BUILDING OF THE     
 TAMAR ROAD BRIDGE IN 1961 REPLACING A 
 FERRY.A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE       
 POPULATION IS EMPLOYED AT THE ROYAL   
 NAVAL DOCKYARD IN DEVONPORT.THERE IS  
 CONSIDERABLE WORRY AT THE PRESENT TIME
 ABOUT REDUNDANCY IN THE DOCKYARD.     
   SALTASH WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED'ESSA' 
 FROM A LOCAL FAMILY CALLED ESSA OR    
 ASHE.QUEEN ELIZABETH 1 IN HER 1584    
 CHARTER REFERS TO THE FACT THAT ESSA  
 IS NOW SALTASH.THE PREFIX "SALT" WAS  
 ADDED PROBABLY TO NOTE IT'S SITUATION 
 ON THE TIDAL RIVER TAMAR.             </content>
