		<title>03CHANGING TIMES OF CARTERTON</title>
		<content> We talked to three generations of one 
 family to discover their separate     
 views  of Carterton. The grandmother  
 remembers the{rural character}of the  
 village in the{1920's.}There were a   
 few shops then but no other amenities.
 Lack of public transport particularly 
 seems to have helped a strong         
 community spirit to develop. Concert  
 parties,harvest suppers and the annual
 flower show were part of the home spun
 entertainment. She feels that the     
 arrival of the airfield caused{'the   
{break up of Carterton'.}Her daughter  
 grew up with the airfield alongside   
 the village and doesn't feel that the 
 character changed until the 50's.She  
 welcomes the{new shops}and is a member
 of 3 of the{many clubs}but regrets    
 the anonymity of the larger town. The 
 youngest member preferred further     
 growth, especially a{sports centre.   </content>
