		<title>15THE LEWES BY-PASS</title>
		<content> Although demands for a by-pass around 
 Lewes were first made around l935 it  
 was not until the l970's that some-   
 thing was done. Heavy traffic on the  
 A27 trunk road through the town had   
 long been a problem.  The large number
 of old listed buildings made widening 
 the narrow streets difficult.  Rapid  
 growth in traffic through Newhaven    
 Port in the l960's increased the      
 urgency of finding a solution. The    
 road crosses the flood plain of the   
 River Ouse on an embankment of crushed
 chalk dug from the deep cutting made  
 through Kingston Ridge. The 3.4 km    
 long by-pass carries a daily average  
 of over l7,000 vehicles away from the 
 Town. It is now possible to cross the 
 High Street in safety and comparative 
 peace. The South Street Tunnel was    
 completed a few years later,G.B's     
 longest road tunnel not underwater.   </content>
