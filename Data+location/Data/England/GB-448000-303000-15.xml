		<title>15The Local Bakery</title>
		<content> Mr Geary met us at the door of the    
 bakery.He told us how the bakery had  
 been going for nearly a hundred       
 years.All the other bakeries in the   
 area have given up long ago but       
 Geary's has survived.                 
      We saw the great silo outside    
 where the white flower is stored and  
 we saw the huge travelling oven where 
 the dough goes in and comes out as    
 bread.The finished bread is wheeled   
 into a lift and taken down to a       
 loading bay where there are 47 vans   
 and a fork lift truck.                
      We went to the cake department   
 where cakes are finished off by hand  
 ready for weddings and birthdays.We   
 watched a man decorating a cake and   
 were allowed to use icing bags to     
 write our names on a table.Mr Geary   
 then told us to go along the racks and
 choose a cake.      {Gemma P.         </content>
