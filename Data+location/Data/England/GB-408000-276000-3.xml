  Many Victorian relics eg.bits of     
 pottery have been dug up from the area
 near the canal locally known as "THE  
 BLACKIES".Digging for such items is   
 now discouraged as the earth around is
 liable to collapse.                   
  Two watermills and a windmill were   
 used to produce flour and needles.None
 survive,but the wood from Peterbrook  
 Mill was re-used in Mill House on     
 Peterbrook Road.                      
  James Webster built one of his       
 factories on Colebrook Road and in    
 1879 he announced that he had invented
 ALUMINIUM.Lord Salisbury,then Prime   
 Minister,visited the factory.Webster  
 was offered a knighthood but refused  
 it.
