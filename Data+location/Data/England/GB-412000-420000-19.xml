		<content>   The William Henry Smith School,     
 formerly an orphanage and named after 
 its founder, is a non-maintained      
 school recognised by the Department of
 Education and Science. It caters for  
 boys from 11 to 16 years of age, who  
 suffer from emotional and social      
 difficulties, on a residential basis. 
 The boys are referred by Local        
 Education Authorities, where they     
 cannot be adequately catered for in   
 day schools. The emphasis is on       
 character building and helping the    
 boys to realise their full potential. 
 Outdoor activities play an important  
 part in this process, and the boys are
 a familiar sight in the district.     
   Hillside Special School caters for  
 about 30 children with severe physical
 and mental handicaps. It has a good   
 relationship with the local community,
 which is active in fund raising.      </content>
