		<title>01SUMMARY OF AREA</title>
		<content> Our area is chiefly arable farm land, 
 this year growing rape,wheat,broad    
 beans and a variety of cash crops,    
 vegetables and soft fruits.Only one   
 mixed farm rears livestock to any     
 significant degree.                   
            Silver End garden village, 
 begun in 1926 by Francis H.Crittall is
 the only village in the block.Using   
 Bourneville as a model he set out to  
 build a self-sufficient village around
 his window making factory and his idea
 still influences the village today.   
 Heron's printing works and John Carr's
 joinery have added to employment,but  
 with the current recession most people
 journey beyond the village to work.The
 recent development of large estates of
 privately owned houses,has almost     
 doubled the population of the village 
 to 3000.A strong community spirit     
 continues to flourish.                </content>
