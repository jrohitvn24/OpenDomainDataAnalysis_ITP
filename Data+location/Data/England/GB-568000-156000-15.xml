		<title>15E.Malling:Novel Apple Trees.</title>
		<content> East Malling Research Station has done
 much work on new branchless apple     
 trees which are planted about 3 feet  
 apart and resemble rows of poles. The 
 apples grow on tiny spurs. These trees
 have been developed from a freak tree 
 found in Brit. Columbia by Mr. Wijcik.
 An E.M.R.S. scientist visiting Canada,
 brought back some pollen. After 10    
 years of crossing and testing, four   
 "columnar" varieties of apple tree    
 have been selected. One is an         
 ornamental crab apple. Two are crosses
 with Golden Delicious. The last has   
 been crossed with "Malling"           
 Greensleeves. These columnars allow   
 high density orchards, minimal        
 pruning, give good yields within a few
 years of planting and give scope for  
 mechanisation. These new varieties    
 should be on sale in the near future.
