		<content>{Have Fothergill &amp; Harvey played any   
{part in the social work- that is the  
{well being of its  employees? }Yes    
 Fothergill &amp; Harvey back even before I
 came had canteens and they used       
 to have medical people to look after  
 the work people.They also built houses
 for their employees i.e.Timbercliffe  
 and Dean head.{Fothergill &amp; Harvey is 
{so important to our area do you think 
{it can survive?How do you think it can
{continue to do so?}Well,I think the   
 survival will come about through the  
 people that are at the top now-who    
 look for needs of industry in the     
 future.They try to develop materials  
 for the future and if they can do that
 and the work-force is willing to adapt
 to changes in their jobs then         
 Fothergill and Harvey's will survive.
