		<content>      The centre of Ripe has all the   
 main amenities, the main water was    
 connected 20 years ago along with main
 drainage. The surrounding area is     
 still on the waiting list for mains   
 drainage. Electricity was installed in
 1936 and pylons and poles were erected
 across the fields. Most houses are    
 detached and have large gardens.      
     {Listed Buildings}                
      Ripe has many buildings of       
 architechtural interest. The oldest

 Church, 13C. built by the order of    
 monks at Michelham Priory. It is      
 cemented with stone dressing and tiled
 roof. There is a chancel, nave with   
 weather-boarded bellturret and a      
 shingled spire. St. John the Baptist
