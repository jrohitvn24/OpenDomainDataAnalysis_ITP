		<title>13BUS ROUTES IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> Buses coming from Hartlepool pass     
 through Hutton Henry to Durham,Bishop 
 Auckland and Sunderland. There is a   
 special bus for the children attending
 Wellfield School in Wingate. Those    
 buses passing through Station Town go 
 to Stockton ,Sunderland, Durham,Bishop
 Auckland and Hartlepool.              
 The traffic survey on June 17th showed
 13 cars and 3 buses drove through     
 Hutton Henry.Most villagers have a car
 because they need to travel to other  
 towns to do shopping, work and for    
 entertainment.The railways in the area
 have already been dismantled and      
 there is now a threat that some of the
 bus services will be discontinued. The
 nearest mainline railway station is   
 eleven miles away at Durham City.About
 7miles away there is Hartlepool which 
 also has a railway station but this is
 a branch line.                        </content>
