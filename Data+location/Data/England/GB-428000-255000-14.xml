		<content>  Fifty people answered the question - 
 'Do you have to travel far to work?'  
  7 people work in Leamington Spa.     
  4 people work in Warwick.            
  4 people work in Stratford upon Avon.
 10 people travel to Coventry or       
    further. Also included are those   
    who have no fixed place of work.   
 25 people work in or around Moreton   
    Morrell.                           
  These figures reflect the employment 
 charateristics of the village. People 
 move to the village as a pleasant     
 place to live. They tend to have      
 houses valued in excess of Â£70,000.   
 However, they work away from the area.
 Whereas, many of those living and     
 working in the area have homes tied to
 their work. The College of Agriculture
 employs several men to run the farm   
 throughout the year. Each has a house 
 whilst employed by the College.       </content>
