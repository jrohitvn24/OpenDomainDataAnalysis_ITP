		<title>08A Village Hall in Cumbria</title>
		<content> The new Village Hall at Sebergham was 
 built in 1983.   It was financed by a 
 large donation from Laings (the       
 national building contractors) who    
 built their first house in the        
 village.   There were grants from the 
 local and county councils, and        
 parishoners raised Â£3000.             
 The interior is wood panelled, the    
 hall seats about 80.   Being bright   
 and new it is much in demand for      
 functions.   It is also used for local
 community events, clubs and classes.  
 Charges range from Â£3 per hour for    
 meetings to Â£25 for dances.           
 There is a twice weekly Playgroup     
 which is well supported.   The        
 Sebergham Women's Institute meets at  
 the Hall, there are about 20 members. 
 The Hall is administered by a         
 Committee of 30, representing 24 local
 families.                             </content>
