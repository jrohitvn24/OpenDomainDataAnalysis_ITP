		<content>  IN WOODGREEN VILLAGE HALL, WHICH     
 STANDS NEXT TO ST.BONIFACE CHURCH,    
 THERE ARE INTERESTING LIFE_SIZE MURALS
 ON THE WALLS. THEY WERE PAINTED IN    
 WATER COLOURS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
 1930'S AND THE CARNEGIE TRUST PROVIDED
 MOST OF THE MONEY. THE SCENES DEPICT  
 VILLAGE LIFE AT THAT TIME AND ALL THE 
 CHARACTERS IN THEM WERE WOODGREEN     
 INHABITANTS. THE PICTURES INCLUDE SUCH
 EVENTS AS THE METHODIST SUNDAY SCHOOL 
 OUTING, THE LOCAL FLOWER SHOW, THE    
 WOODGREEN FOLK-DANCING GROUP AND      
 CIDER-MAKING. THEY ATTRACT MANY       
 VISTORS AND THEY  HAVE ALSO BEEN THE  
 SUBJECT OF A TELEVISION PROGRAMME.    
  SALISBURY INFIRMARY APPEARS IN ONE   
 MURAL , FOR MANY VILLAGERS PAID ONE   
 PENNY A WEEK FOR HOSPITAL TREATMENT   
 IN CASE THEY SHOULD THEY NEED IT .
