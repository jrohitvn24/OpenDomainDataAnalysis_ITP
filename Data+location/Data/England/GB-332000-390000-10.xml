   Many  people  in  this  area  are   
 unemployed.  Many older people  worked
 on  the docks but they have nearly all
 closed down  except for the  Container
 Base  where  the  grain  comes  in.   
  {There  were lots of jobs for  people
{in  the sugar and cardboard box plants
{and the tobacco factory on  Commercial
{Road but they too have all closed down
   While many of the men  worked on the
 docks or went to sea,many women worked
 as  cleaners in hospitals and offices.
  {The sugar factory provided many jobs
{but  when it recently  closed down  it
{made  many  people  redundant.        
{ }Many of the  young  people  in  this
 area  don't have a  special  skill  or
 trade  because  there  are  not enough
 factories  to  take  on  apprentices. 
  {Many  people  have been  out of work
{for as long as eleven years. }        </content>
