		<content> There are several  main roads in      
 Hemyock,each one with some houses in  
 it. The road with the most houses in  
 it is Station Road with approximately 
 sixty houses. Then there is Culmstock 
 Road with roughly twenty houses along 
 it. The other roads have between five 
 and twenty houses along them. All of  
 these houses are privately owned, but 
 the houses on the Eastlands estate are
 all council houses. The other estates 
 are called Castle Park, Prowses,      
 Churchills and Hollingarth Way (which 
 is not yet completed). The houses in  
 Hemyock are of different types. Some  
 are detatched, some semi-detatched    
 some are bungalows, some terraced and 
 some flats. Most of the flats in      
 Hemyock are on the estate called      
 Churchills.
