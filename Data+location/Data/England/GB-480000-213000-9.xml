		<title>09SHOP TRADE IN AYLESBURY</title>
		<content>  We visited a Tesco's {hypermarket} in
Aylesbury. It had a petrol station,    
which helped its business, and a cafe. 
The goods were brought by lorries from 
{Tesco} depots or other firms. Tesco's 
has 33 tills so that people don't have 
to queue for a long time. The store we 
visited baked all of its own cakes and 
crusty bread on the premises. The      
bakers have to start work at midnight  
to prepare bread for the next day. We  
then visited a {small shop}. It sold   
mostly meat and tinned goods but also  
dairy products. His goods were supplied
from Denmark and Holland. He told us   
that Tesco's had not yet affected his  
{trade} because it draws people into   
the town.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
