		<content>   Local church members were concerned 
 about the apparent need to provide    
 suitable living accommodation for     
 elderly or infirm people in the local 
 community.They wished,while           
 maintaining their independence,to live
 in easily maintainable surroundings,  
 close to other like minded people with
 similar requirements with a helping   
 hand close by if required.The         
 difficulty has been to locate either a
 suitable plot or a convertible        
 building for the purpose.Currently    
 negotiations are in hand for part of  
 the plot now containing Hutton        
 Populars.A development on similar     
 lines is to be opened in early 1986,  
 managed by Countryside Properties on a
 site bounded by Shorter Avenue and    
 Chelmsford Road.
