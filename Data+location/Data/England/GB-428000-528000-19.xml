		<content>   Today there are fewer shops,        
 although we do have a small           
 supermarket, schools for infants and  
 juniors only, a small new industrial  
 estate and many more houses.          
   The children still seem to play     
 similar outdoor games to their        
 grandparents and also to play in the  
 same woods and fields as their        
 parents. Fifty years ago indoor       
 entertainment was supplied by the     
 radio or the gramophone but nowadays  
 we have television and videos.        
   Chilton can still provide many of   
 its own needs having a Health Centre, 
 pubs, clubs and opportunity for a     
 variety of recreational activities at 
 the newly developed Community College,
 but old sights such as the coal being 
 dumped on the back street to be       
 shovelled into the coalhouse have gone
 for ever.                             </content>
