		<content>{VICAR POND}     {by SARAH McKIE       
                                       
 Vicar Spring has been called that     
 since 1830. Vicar Water originally    
 comes from Vicar Spring. Vicar Water  
 is a dammed stream. Vicar Stream has  
 been dammed and it is now a pond. Some
 recreation began in 1979 and was      
 finished in 1984. Some of the trees   
 have been planted and some of them are
 wild. Some of the birds that nest in  
 Vicar Pond are ducks, heron and coot. 
 Some of the fish in Vicar Pond are    
 bream, carp and stickle backs.        
 Eventually it will be a park for      
 picnics and for day trips with picnic 
 areas. The ranger Peter Jarman looks  
 after the park and takes people round 
 like schools and old age pensioners.  
 Most of the pit tips have been        
 reclaimed and grassed over. In twenty 
 years it should be at its best.       </content>
