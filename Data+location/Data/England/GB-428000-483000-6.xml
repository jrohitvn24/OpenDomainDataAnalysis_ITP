		<title>06EDUCATION IN BURNESTON AREA</title>
		<content> In Burneston, just opposit the church,
 there is a little group of old        
 buildings. There is a row of alms     
 houses with the original school joined
 on. The schoolmaster used to live in a
 room upstairs. The schoolroom was     
 converted into a kitchen for school   
 meals later on. Next door there is the
 Old School which was built in 1852,   
 and was in use even after the new     
 school was opened in 1974. There was  
 not enough room in the new school so  
 the infants worked there. When the    
 number of pupils dropped then the Old 
 School was not used any more, until   
 the Nursery School opened in 1984.    
 Children who attend Burneston come    
 from Melmerby, Wath, Middleton        
 Quernhow, Sutton Howgrave, Norton     
 Conyers, Kirklington, Carthorpe,      
 Burneston, Theakstone and Exelby.
