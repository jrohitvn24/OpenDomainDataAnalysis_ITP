		<title>03Esholt..Introduction 2</title>
		<content> The village of Esholt was not         
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Book because of an accident.It seems  
 that William the Conqueror's clerks,  
 having visited both Esholt and nearby 
 Hawksworth,became confused when later 
 they wrote up their findings and      
 referred to them both as Hawksworth.  
 In 1940 the vicar speculated in the   
 Parish Magazine on the origin of the  
 name of the village.He wrote:-If Mr   
 Hitler could have seen it-which God   
 forbid-he would have called it an{    
{Esche}tree.That is the German name for
 it.That name came to England with the 
 Saxons,but it came to be changed to{  
{ash}in time...{Holt}is the German name
 for a wood.And so we get our village  
 name.{Esholt}probably comes from      
{Escheholt} a wood of ash trees.
