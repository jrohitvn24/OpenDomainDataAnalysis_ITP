		<content>  The Guide meeting takes place at     
7:30 immediately after the Brownies    
have finished in the school hall.      
There are about 14 members, but this   
is soon to be increased by some people 
coming up from the Brownie pack when   
they are eleven.  Mrs Wilford is the   
Captain of the group.  We have groups  
as do the Brownies, but they have      
different names, and are called patrols
as opposed to sixes.  During the       
meetings we work towards some of the   
many badges that you can get, and then 
we have some games.  In the summer we  
have lots of outdoor activities, and   
this is often really good fun.         
  At the end of the evening, we all    
gather together in a horseshoe shape,  
to sing the traditional song and salute
our Captain.  We always say a prayer   
before we go home.
