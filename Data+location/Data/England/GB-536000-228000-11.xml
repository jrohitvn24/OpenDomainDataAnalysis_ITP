		<title>11Aspenden Festival</title>
		<content> In the 1950s and 1960s many parish    
 chuches began to hold Flower Festivals
 to make the churches look beautiful   
 and to raise money for costly repairs.
                                       
 The Aspenden Festival grew out of this
 custom. Each year the Committee runs  
 an Arts Festival with a varied        
 programme which has included musical  
 and dramatic performances of a very   
 high standard.                        
                                       
 As St. Mary's, Aspenden, is remote and
 parking space is very limited, local  
 schools lend their minibuses and a    
 free service is offered from          
 Buntingford during the Festival.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
