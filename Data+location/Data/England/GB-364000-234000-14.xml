 In this area of scanty population     
 there is really no village centre &amp;   
 few public places where people meet.  
{Little Marcle}has a general shop &amp; sub
 Post Office in converted half-timbered
 cottages on the old Roman road.   The 
 shop is open all hours &amp; attracts     
 passing trade &amp; custom from a wide    
 area.                                 
 At{Rushall}the sub Post Office also   
 sells a few groceries.                
 There is a licensed working men's club
 which is popular for billiards &amp;      
 darts.   The building was presented to
 the village &amp; is run by a trust.      
 Until recently part of the building   
 was a Youth Hostel &amp; the weathercock  
 commemorates this.
