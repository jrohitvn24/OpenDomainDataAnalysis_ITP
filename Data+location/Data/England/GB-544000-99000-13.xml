		<title>13ENVIRONS OF NEWHAVEN</title>
		<content> Newhaven is situated in the Ouse      
 Valley, the river estuary providing a 
 busy port and harbour.  The           
 surrounding downs and 3 farms are     
 largely pasture and arable land.  On  
 the coast, chalk cliffs stretch to the
 west, ending at the breakwater.  At   
 the harbour entrance the East and West
 piers channel the shipping.  The      
 pebble beach of Seaford Bay reveals   
 some sand at low tide.                
 The town has architectural variety.   
 St. Michael's Church dates from 1120. 
 Built of flint stone and Caen rock,   
 the style, particularly the axial     
 tower and apsidal east end, is one    
 rarely found in Britain.  Enlarged in 
 the nineteenth century, the church    
 still holds regular Sunday services   
 attracting a congregation of between  
 80-100 people.                        
                                       </content>
