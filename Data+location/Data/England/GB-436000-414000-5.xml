		<title>05Public Footpaths near Ryhill</title>
		<content> The survey area contains many         
 interesting routes for walkers.Two    
 long paths,from Wintersett to Walton  
 and to Crofton,have disappeared under 
 the Anglers Opencast site,but may be  
 reinstated when reclamation is        
 complete.A third connects Havercroft  
 with Foulby,although it skirts Nostell
 colliery.                             
 Several paths pass through the        
 attractive countryside around the two 
 reservoirs and the towpath of the     
 Barnsley canal provides pleasant      
 walking.In Haw Park woods there are   
 sections of two public footpaths and  
 other Forestry Commission permissive  
 paths.                                
 There are two attractive bridleways:  
 from Ryhill to Wintersett and to      
 Havercroft.A long stretch of the      
 disused railway from Ryhill to Crofton
 has been made into a public footpath. </content>
