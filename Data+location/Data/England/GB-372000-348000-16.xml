		<title>16        BETLEY COURT</title>
		<content>   Betley Court is occupied by         
Professor Brown,his wife and students  
who live in  10 flats he converted     
from the main building in the late     
1970's.He bought the Court in 1977     
because he thought it was an           
interesting building.He moved there in 
1978.Big alterations have been made    
since he moved in,including costly     
roof repairs.There are 10 rooms in the 
house,and none are disused. Betley     
Court was built in 1716 as a home for  
the Fletcher Twemlow family,a hospital 
and a rehabilitation centre.Prof.      
Brown says there are no secret passage 
ways,ghosts or secret stairways.Prof.  
Brown also runs an antique gallery.In  
the gallery he has a replica of the    
"Betley window" which is the oldest    
picture of morris dancers in Britain   
and is from the 1500Â£s and in 1981     
it was depicted on a stamp.            </content>
