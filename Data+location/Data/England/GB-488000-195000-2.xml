		<title>02PENN WOODS IN HOLMER GREEN</title>
		<content>Penn Woods forms part of the green belt
,and is the largest wood in this area, 
being about 2 km squared.It is         
situated  to the south east of Holmer  
Green village of the A404.It is        
not a planned  wood.In places the      
trees grow close together and thus     
some are bent in one direction.In      
other places the trees are spaced      
apart and let a lot of  sunlight       
through.The main species of decidous   
trees are Beech,Birch and Oak.Most of  
the trees are fully grown,but there    
are seedlings and young trees under    
many of the larger trees.The wood      
has plantations of young evergreens    
and  groves of rhododendrons.There     
are a few marshes.Some of these are    
quite deep.They sometimes look just    
like grass,but  they smell             
horrible.They disappear in warm ,dry   
weather.                               </content>
