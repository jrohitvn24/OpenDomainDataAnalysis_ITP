		<content> spent until a certain age.  People    
 saved their money in banks, building  
 societies, piggy-banks, glass jars,   
 and the Post Office.  Some children   
 saved up to buy something that was    
 more expensive than what they         
 received, the top of this list being  
 computer software.  53% of the class  
 saved their money in the bank.        
 18% would lose money for bad behaviour
 and 79% could earn more money if they 
 did extra work in the home.  79% of   
 the children believed the amount they 
 received was sufficient.
