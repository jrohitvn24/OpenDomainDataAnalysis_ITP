		<title>17EGLOSKERRY VILLAGE. (2)</title>
		<content> The{Post Office}is also a general     
 store, selling food, fruit and        
 vegetables, bread, domestic cleaning  
 materials, toothpaste etc. One hundred
 years ago it used to be the village   
 pub.In the nineteenth century there   
 was, and still is in Cornwall, a      
 strong teetotal tradition, and many   
 village pubs were bought by movements 
 such as the Rechabites, and turned    
 into domestic dwellings.That is what  
 happened to this building, but it     
 later became the shop and P.O.Further 
 on there is{St. Keri Court,}a group of
 bungalows for old people with a       
 warden to look after them. Next door  
 is the{Primary School}with 50 children
 and two teachers, the classrooms being
 two prefabricated buildings.Fifty     
 metres beyond the school this part of 
 the village ends. The rest is on a    
 road leading south from the church.   </content>
