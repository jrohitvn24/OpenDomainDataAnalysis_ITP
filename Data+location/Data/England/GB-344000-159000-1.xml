		<content> I will describe our area and the      
 activities of the people who live in  
 it.                                   
   Our survey area covers the northern 
 slopes of the Mendip Hills and the    
 Vale of Wrington.The ridge of the     
 limestone hills is bleak and exposed, 
 but the slopes are heavily wooded.The 
 communities of Burrington, Upper      
 Langford, Doleberrow and Churchill are
 at the foot of these slopes.To the    
 north of the villages the land is     
 largely agricultural grassland        
 supporting beef and dairy cattle.     
    Two major roads intersect at       
 Churchill Gate.The A368 Bath to Weston
 road follows the foot of the slope of 
 the hills, whilst the A38 is a major  
 road from the South West to the North 
 Midlands. The M5, built 15 years ago, 
 has taken away much of the traffic.   
 The road is still very busy.          </content>
