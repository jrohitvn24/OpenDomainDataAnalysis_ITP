 They shopped at Shaftesbury and       
 Tisbury, usually Tisbury. There were  
 three shops in Hindon. There used to  
 be a wool shop that sold small things 
 for presents, a baker who delivered   
 and a farmer who delivered milk.      
{1985                                  
 We shop at Shaftesbury mainly,        
 sometimes Tisbury and sometimes at the
 big shopping centre in Crockerton. We 
 sometimes go into Salisbury for       
 special things such as shoes. We have 
 4 shops. One is the Post Office which 
 sells mainly food and cleaning stuff. 
 Quite a lot of people go there.       
 Another shop is the delicatessen which
 sells mainly health foods. The others 
 are antique shops. All the other shops
 are now houses. There is no baker in  
 the village. The milkman delivers from
 Tisbury.                              </content>
