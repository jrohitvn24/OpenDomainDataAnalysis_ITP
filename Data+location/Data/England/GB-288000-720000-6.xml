		<title>06HOUSES ON THE ESTATE 1</title>
		<content>     Most of the houses on the         
{Abercairney Estate}are more than a    
 hundred years old.  Although they were
 built at roughly the same time they   
 look very different.                  
     One of the houses was a cottage   
 and had only 1 level, the other house 
 was built onto the Estate stables.    
 The stables and the houses were very  
 large compared to the cottage.  The   
 house that I visited in the stables   
 had 2 levels.                         
     Both the houses have been         
 modernised in the past but no         
 extentions have been added as the     
 houses don't belong to the family, but
 to the{ Estate. }The men of the       
 families are both estate workers, so  
 the houses are included in the jobs.  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
