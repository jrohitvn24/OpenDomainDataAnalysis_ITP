		<content>{71%}of the population in 1985 were    
 born in Yorkshire. Looking back over  
 other census data it was the coming of
 the railway to Brompton which began to
 bring other people into the community 
 from away.                            
     In 1871 an amazing{88%}of the     
 employed population were farm         
 labourers or servants. Other jobs were
 connected to life in a feudal village 
 e.g. grooms, dressmakers, blacksmiths,
 joiners,footmen etc. By loking at the 
 population in 1871 we saw that        
 Brompton was a self-contained farming 
 community.                            
   Nowadays farming is still important 
 but only{6%}of people work on farms,  
 not so many people are needed now to  
 run big farms.The single biggest      
 occupation now is schoolteachers{10%!}
 _but the sample returns for 1985 were 
 much less than in 1871.               </content>
