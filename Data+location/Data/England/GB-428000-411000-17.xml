		<title>17My Mum's Hobbies.</title>
		<content> About three years ago my mum and some 
 of her friends started writing about  
 the village. Two people called Brian  
 and Sue came in an Artivan and helped 
 them. They started off writing stories
 and poems about Woolley Colliery now  
 compared with what it was like in     
 their childhood. Then they learned    
 lots of new things like how to        
 develop films and print photographs.  
 They made a big banner for Mrs.       
 Willey's anniversary.They printed     
 T-shirts and posters, and took their  
 work to several exhibitions. When they
 were learning how to do screen        
 printing they were filmed for         
 television. Filming was done in school
 and in our homes and outdoors as well.
 The completed film was shown on       
 Channel 4 on June 1st. 1985.
