		<title>10AN ABBATTOIR IN CROSSGATES</title>
		<content> In Crossgates there is a{slaughter    
{house.}Mr.Green our local butcher at  
 the abbattoir, prefers to buy, kill   
 and prepare his own meat. It is not   
 only cheaper and more convenient but  
 far more satisfying because he has    
 complete control of the meat from the 
{"hoof to the shop".}He also hangs the 
 meat traditionally until mature,      
 thereby enhancing its taste and       
 quality. There is a lot of paper work 
 involved at the abbattoir, a record   
 has to be kept of all the animals that
 are killed and regular vetinary       
 inspections are also required. Every  
 time an animal is slaughtered the     
 local meat inspector must stamp the   
 carcus before allowing it to go into  
 the shops. Due to the butchers        
 personal involvement with the animals 
 the quality of his meat is excellent.
