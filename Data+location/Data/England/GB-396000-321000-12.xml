		<content>  Milford, on the main road from       
Stafford to Rugeley is frequented by   
visitors to Cannock Chase, a popular   
area for picnics and walking.The name  
Milford comes from mill  and ford.     
  The original mill was situated where 
the swimming bath house now stands at  
Milford Hall. The Hall was built in    
the late 17th Century with grounds     
covering over 15 acres.                
 Interview with Paul's grandad:-       
 My grandad,who is a   retired hedge-  
layer,used to work on the Milford      
Estate.  He and his family moved to    
their present cottage, built in the    
reign of George the third, in 1945.    
  He told us "I can remember when the  
Hall employed many servants,but there  
are are none now. At one time we knew  
everybody but now there are a lot of   
new people.Many of the old buldings    
have been converted into homes."       </content>
