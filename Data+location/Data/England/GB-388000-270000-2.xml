		<content> The first piece of land looked at was 
 Oakfield Farm.It consisted of several 
 large fields which were divided up by 
 a small winding lane.The rest of this 
 area was mainly the same, isolated    
 farms surrounded by fields.These farms
 were called Clattercut Farm and       
 Lowbridge Farm.                       
    Rushock Village was in this area   
 yet it was not a village in the proper
 sense of the word,it was only ten     
 houses and a church.It was so small we
 didn't realise we were going through  
 it until we reached the church.       
    Over the whole area 60% of the     
 ground was taken up by grassland,27%  
 grazing land,6% residential area.Then 
 there was land reserved for Horse     
 jumping and orchards which took up 4% 
 and 3% respectively.
