		<content>  Square 9 of the block includes the   
 northern part of Baldock, a market    
 town of about 12 000 people.  This is 
 mainly a residential area.            
                                       
  Most of the housing is yellow brick  
 Victorian terracing, built between the
 town centre and the railway station.  
  Some 20th century housing has been   
 built in this infill area, probably on
 old Victorian terrace sites.          
                                       
  Immediately South of the railway     
 station are 1930's  semis and 1970's 5
 bedroom mock Georgian houses.         
                                       
  North of the station is a small area 
 of private housing just completed.    
 This, combined with development       
 elsewhere in Baldock, is a good       
 example of very recent urban          
 expansion.                            </content>
