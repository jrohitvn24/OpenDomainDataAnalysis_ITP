On Saturday I got up,washed and        
dressed.I went downstairs,had my hair  
done,had breakfast and got in the car. 
We went to the canal boat where Mom    
works.On the way we saw some shops. I  
had a mouse and my sister had a teddy  
bear. Then we had dinner. We put the   
bag in the boat and went for a walk    
along the tow-path. After the walk we  
went back to the boat. We went for a   
trip on boat. I opened a lock and the  
dog kept jumping on me. We only went a 
little way and the boat stopped and we 
had to pull it back. We went back on   
the boat for tea and a drink. Then we  
went back home and went to bed. I took 
my mouse to bed and my sister took her 
teddy bear too.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
