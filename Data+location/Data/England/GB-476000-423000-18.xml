 cottages where the farm workers lived.

 used to be{five shops}including{the   
{post office, a butcher's and the      
{grocery store.}Now there are only two,
{the newsagent and the post-office.}   
 Some of the shops sold paraffin       
 because there was no electric light.At
 the end of the village there was a

{Skelton.}It cost{1d for children}and{ 
{4d for adults.}There used to be{three
