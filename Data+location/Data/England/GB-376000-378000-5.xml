		<title>05SHAWHEATH/LONGRIDGE CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> This carnival is held every year at   
 the beginning of July.  The Carnival  
 Queen and her retinue ride in         
 procession on a decorated lorry       
 followed by queens from other areas   
 such as Mobberley and Ashley,         
 decorated floats, marching bands and  
 people in fancy dress.  The parade    
 starts and finishes at the Birkin     
 Centre.  There are prizes for the best
 fancy dress and the best decorated    
 float.  After the parade the queen is 
 crowned and then there is a programme 
 of events.  This year there was an    
 exhibition of 'break dancing' which   
 consists of robotic movements followed
 by more traditional Morris Dancers and
 a selection of pieces played by the   
 St. John's Wood School percussion     
 group.  There were stalls selling     
 cakes and fancy goods and teas.
