   While I was waiting I had some      
 dinner of ham rolls.When Tim had put  
 his pony away we went home.           
   When we arrived home I fed my pony  
 and put a rug on her.I fed our dog and
 then went to the house.I had my tea.  
 For my tea I had chicken.When I had   
 had my tea I watched the"39 Steps"on  
 television.I also watched some other  
 programmes.Later I went upstairs,had a
 wash and went to bed.
