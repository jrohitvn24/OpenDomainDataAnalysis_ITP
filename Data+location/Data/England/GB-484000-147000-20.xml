		<title>20   My Dad's a Commuter</title>
		<content>      From Monday to Friday every week 
 my dad drives to work at Sunbury on   
 Thames, London. We live in Farnham, it
 is quite expensive with the cost of   
 petrol so my dad and about four of his
 friends from work do a 'car swap'.This
 means that one person drives the rest 
 to work one week, then another person 
 drives another week. So in the long   
 run they only have to drive to work   
 one week in five. It is about 33 miles
 to where my dad works so he leaves    
 home at about 7:30 and gets home at   
 about 6:00. In the dictionary the     
 word commuter means someone who       
 travels by bus, car or train to work  
 and back everyday.
