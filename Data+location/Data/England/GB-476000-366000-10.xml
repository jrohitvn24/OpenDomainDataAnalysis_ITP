		<content>   Roads in the area vary from small   
{private roads}giving access to farm   
 property, to the{A1.(dual carriageway)
 The map indicates that there have been
 3 separate main roads built at various
 times. The first road passed through  
{Weston,}and was later rebuilt to      
 by-pass the village, meeting the      
 demands of greater volumes of road    
 traffic. When the present A1 was      
 built, it was designed as a much      
 straighter, more direct route, with   
 intersections and bridges indicative  
 of modern motorways. It is an         
 extremely busy trunk road, taking most
 of the long-distance traffic heading  
 north and south through the eastern   
 region of Britain.                    
  {Crow Park Farm}was divided by the   
 new A1, so planners were obliged to   
 build an extra roadbridge solely for  
 the purpose of access to the farmland.</content>
