		<title>11ABBEY BRIDGE</title>
		<content>    Abbey Bridge(ref:065,149)is a      
 graceful single arched bridge made of 
 stone.It is 78 metres long and        
 5 metres wide in the centre,spanning  
 the River Tees which here flows       
 through a limestone gorge.Heavy       
 traffic has been diverted over the    
 bridge.This has weakened the bridge   
 which has now been strenghthened by   
 wooden beams.Abbey{Bridge}was opened  
 on June 19th 1773.It used to be a toll
 bridge with a fee of 1/2d for         
 pedestrians.The road over the bridge  
 is between Greta Bridge and Barnard   
 Castle.There are impressive views     
 up-stream and down-stream from the    
 bridge.
