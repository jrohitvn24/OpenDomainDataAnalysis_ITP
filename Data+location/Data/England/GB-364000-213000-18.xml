		<content>{In September of this year all schools 
{are going in this area are going      
{comprehensive. This means that the    
{children here will not have to sit an 
{exam to see which secondary school    
{they will go to.                      
 A lot of schools are getting new      
 names. The Grammar school in Coleford 
 will be called Lakers. Double View    
 Secondary will be called the Heyward  
 school. The new headmaster will be    
 called Mr East, he is very nice and   
 very strict. The school is named after
 the tree plantation behind it. We will
 be the first people to go to the      
 Heywood School. Everywhere there are  
 going to be schools changing. We will 
 have to wear a bottle green uniform.
