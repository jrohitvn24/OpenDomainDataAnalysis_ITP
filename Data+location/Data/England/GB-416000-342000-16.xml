		<content>  A Day In The Life Of Joy Payne       
                                       
 On Saturday mornings I get up get     
 dressed and then go down for my       
 breakfast.I have a drink of coffee and
 sometimes some toast.When I have had  
 my breakfast I go upstairs and have a 
 wash then I come down again and I go  
 round for Caroline about 9.30am to    
 10.00am. When she has got ready we go 
 up to my house and sometimes go up to 
 Ashbourne.                            
  When we come back we play outside for
 a bit and watch television then I have
 my dinner and we sometimes bake for my
 mum.                                  
   When we have done a few cakes my    
 Aunty Lynn and Uncle Roger come round 
 for a drink.When they go we play out  
 for a bit then it is time for my tea. 
 When I finished my tea we stop in and 
 watch television.                     </content>
