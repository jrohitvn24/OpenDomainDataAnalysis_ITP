		<content> Springfield Place dates back to about 
 1573. It was an Elizabethen house and 
 is now Georgian style.There's supposed
 to be a ghost haunting the house.The  
 story is told that the owners wife had
 a child who was ill,so her mother took
 her into the blue room so as not to   
 disturb her father.She put the baby to
 bed and went to bed herself.She woke  
 up later to hear her daughter saying, 
 'Funny man,funny man'.She looked up   
 and saw a dwarf standing with his back
 to the fire.She was so frightened she 
 shot under the bed covers.She looked  
 up again and the man was gone.Her     
 daughter was still saying, 'Funny     
 man,funny man'.There's been recent    
 reports of the ghost.A workman left   
 his tools in the blue room.When he    
 returned his tools were gone and were 
 later found in another room.
