		<title>05THE HAMLET OF GRAFTON</title>
		<content>   This forms part of the parish of    
 Beckford and consists of 24 houses, 3 
 of which are farm houses. Most are of 
 stone or part stone construction, but 
 3 are brick and 4 are half timbered.  
 All were built after 1890 and have    
 mains water and electricity with      
 septic tank drainage.                 
   The main agricultural activity is   
 sheep farming but a four hundred head 
 calf rearing unit and a grain drier   
 have recently been constructed there. 
   With the high mechanisation of      
 farming the future of{Grafton}as a    
 community is likely to be as a        
 dormitary for local towns, many of the
 residents already being employed      
 outside the area.                     
   The future as a retirement area also
 seems to be in prospect with an       
 increase in the number of retired     
 residents.                            </content>
