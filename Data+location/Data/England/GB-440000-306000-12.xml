 down stairs for my breakfast, I have  
 Coco Pops. I have a wash and clean my 
 teeth, comb my hair and put on my     
 shoes and coat. I walk to the bus stop
 and get on when the bus comes.When I  
 get to school the bell rings at{9 a.m.

 go swimming at Ibstock High School by 
 bus. When we come back playtime has   
 already started and the tuck shop is  
 closed. We do our spellings and then  
 go in to the hall to have our dinner. 
 At dinner time we play outside and at
