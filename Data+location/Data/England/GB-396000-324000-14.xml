		<title>14  TRENT AND MERSEY CANAL</title>
		<content>  In 1766,the Trent and Mersey Canal   
Act was passed by Parliament.James     
Brindley was appointed engineer of the 
new canal.In 1777 the canal was opened 
for the transport of industrial        
materials.                             
  It is now mainly used for holidays.At
many of the canal's junctions,boats can
be hired out for holiday uses.The      
stretch of the canal from Weston to    
Great Haywood Junction is very scenic  
and good for holidays.                 
  The Trent and Mersey Canal is much   
favoured for its fishing.Some common   
fishes in the canal are:perch,roach and
carp.                                  
  In the stretch from Weston to Great  
Haywood Junction,there are 6 bridges   
and 2 locks.The 2 locks have a total   
height of 15'9".The bridges were built 
for horses to cross over the canal when
the tow-path changed sides.            </content>
