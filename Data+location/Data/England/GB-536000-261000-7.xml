		<title>07THE DRIFT -  A BRIDLEWAY</title>
		<content>   The Drift is the bridleway that     
 links Dry Drayton and Bar Hill.When we
 looked at some nineteenth and early   
 twentieth century maps of our area we 
 found that The Drift used to go right 
 through to Longstanton,another village
 about two miles east of Bar Hill.There
 used to be a farm called Willow Farm  
 on the site of what is now Bar        
 Hill.(The old farmhouse still         
 stands in the centre of the village).A
 toll bar was erected across the       
 bridleway near the farmhouse.         
 Eventually the name of the farm was   
 changed to Bar Farm.We believe that   
 this is where the"Bar"in the village's
 name came from.The village is also    
 built on about the only hill for miles
 around _ we do in fact have a trig    
 station at the village's highest point
 _ so we feel that it is for these two 
 reasons that the village got its name.</content>
