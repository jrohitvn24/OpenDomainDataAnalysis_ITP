		<title>14DEEPING ST.JAMES DOG KENNELS</title>
		<content>     The owner of Joseter kennels      
 enters his dogs at all of the major   
 dog shows including Crufts and the    
 Peterborough Show. He travels all over
 the country to these competitions.The 
 prizes at these shows are challenge   
 certificates. If a dog wins three of  
 these (under different judges) it can 
 be called a champion.                 
     The cost of a Corgy puppy is about
 Â£80. A Boston Terrier costs about Â£200
 while a Bichon Frise is Â£100 to Â£150. 
    The kennels has a boarding licence 
 for 68 dogs,and they own up to 30 dogs
 which they are breeding. Before a dog 
 can be boarded the owner has to produ-
 uce an up to date inoculation certifi-
 cate.This shows that the dog has had  
 injections against hard pad distemper 
 and parvo virus.                      
      The dogs are fed on a complete   
 dog food and also on undressed tripe. </content>
