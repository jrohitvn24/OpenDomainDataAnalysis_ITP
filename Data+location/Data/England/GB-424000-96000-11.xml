		<content> Sway has 2 garages, 2 public houses   
 and 2 hotels. Sway Station is on the  
 main line between London and          
 Bournemouth, and was built in 1886.   
 Semi-fast trains stop at Sway, and    
 there are connections for fast trains 
 to London via Southampton. A small    
 industrial site of 9 units has        
 recently been built on land beside the
 station. Sway Primary School, formerly
 St Lukes C.E. School, has moved this  
 year to new buildings, and the school 
 field will include a recreation area  
 for pre-school children and 2 tennis  
 courts to be shared with Sway Tennis  
 Club. The Parish Council has 8 elected
 members and a Clerk and is responsible
 for allotments and recreational areas,
 planning applications etc. The monthly
 meetings are open to the public.
