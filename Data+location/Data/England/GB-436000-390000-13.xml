		<content>{How many fights have you won or lost?}
 Ha! Ha! You don't know much about me, 
 do you?  I've had 32 professional     
 fights and I've won 32.               
{Have you ever been knocked out?}      
 No, but I've been knocked down once   
 because I wasn't looking.             
{How many hours do you train each day? 
 I start off at 05.30 and go for a half
 hour run.  When I get back I have a   
 shower and then go back to bed until  
 11.00.  At 16.30 after work, I train  
 for 2 hours at the Plumpton Boy's     
 Club.  This is an old church in       
 Wincobank which has been converted    
 into a gym.  Brendan Ingle is my      
 trainer.                              
{Will you ever stop boxing?            
 Yes I will, as soon as I start getting
 hurt and cut.
