		<title>06St. Peter's Church</title>
		<content> It is uncertain whether the church was
 originally dedicated to St. Peter or  
 St. Bartholomew when it was built in  
 the late 11th. century. The walls were
 built from the bricks and flint from a
 nearby Roman villa. It is derelict now
 and in a very bad state of disrepair. 
 The last burial in the now overgrown  
 churchyard was thought to be in 1938, 
 and until the summer of 1982          
 occasional services were held there.  
 It is said that there were some       
 witches buried in the churchyard and  
 there is a tombstone at the north end 
 of the church with the inscription    
 "HERE THE WICKED CEASE FROM TROUBLING 
 AND THE WEARY ARE AT REST".
