		<title>02HISTORY AT HIGH DOWN HOUSE</title>
		<content> I took four boys to visit High Down on
 June 8,1985.We were made very welcome 
 and shown into the sitting room.The   
 owners answered our questions and gave
 us a brief history of the place.      
 It is c.1603 and was builtfor the son 
 ofThomas Dowcra on his marriage to    
 Jane Perriam.The last heir,female,sold
 the house on her marriage.It went to  
 Ralph Ratcliffe,owner of Hitchin      
 Priory,a wealthy merchant in the      
 Lavant trade.He bought it as a Dowr   
 House.The Radcliffes married into the 
 Delme family and the present owner is 
 a direct descendant.He rented High    
 Down in 1955 and bought it in 1972.   
 He hopes his two sons will inherit it.
 We saw the basement,which had been the
 kitchins.In a cupboard was an entrance
 for an old passage-an ascape for      
 priests long ago?The boys explored the
 tunnel,entering from the courtyard.   </content>
