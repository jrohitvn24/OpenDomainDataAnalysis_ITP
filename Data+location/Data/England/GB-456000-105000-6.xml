		<content> A local market has been a feature of  
 the town since early times.This       
 developed in the last century into a  
 seperate cattle market-which is now   
 held in Southampton-and the local     
 market is now one of many stalls which
 fill the cattle market site.It is held
 every Monday and is something of a    
 draw for people from the surrounding  
 districts.                            
 A very large covered pedestrian       
 shopping prescinct has attracted many 
 of the big store national names with  
 many local names as well.An even      
 temperature all the year round,with   
 pleasant squares with seating,make    
 this not only an ideal shopping centre
 but,"Meet me at the fountain" has     
 become something of a local           
 catchphrase.
