 village in the last year. Over a third
 of the population in the village have 
 lived there ten years or more. The    
 same proportion came from more than   
 fifty miles. There was only one person

 majority had no children. The children
 tended to be under eleven. Some older 
 children had to travel to school.     
 Most of the population in this village
 are retired. Hobbies were common, the 
 most popular being gardening.         
 Pets were owned by half of the people,
 the most popular being dogs.          
 Shopping was done locally by half the 
 people, one third spent their leisure 
 locally.                              
 A car was the most usual transport,   
 but a third used the bus.             
 Most people rated their amenities as  
 good.                                 </content>
