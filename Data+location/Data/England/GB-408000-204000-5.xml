		<title>05WILDLIFE ON RACK ISLE,BIBURY</title>
		<content> Rack Isle is a National Trust Wildfowl
 Reserve that lies in the centre of    
 Bibury and is almost surrounded by    
 water.Most of the river birds nest on 
 the Isle especially Mallards,Coots    
 and Moorhens.It is the home of many   
 wetland creatures and plants. The     
 river banks are inhabited by water    
 voles and moles. The marshy areas have
 toads, frogs and snakes. Several      
 species of wetland plants are found on
 Rack Isle. The most obvious are the   
 flowering plants like Marsh Marigolds,
 Ragged Robin, Meadow Sweet, Yellow    
 Iris, Monkey Flower and Comfrey, but  
 other plants are more inconspicuous   
 like the grasses, sedges, bullrushes  
 and butterbur. Recently, more trees   
 have been planted, particularly poplar
 and willow. Rack Isle's name dates    
 from when it was used for drying the  
 cloth used in Arlington Mill.         </content>
