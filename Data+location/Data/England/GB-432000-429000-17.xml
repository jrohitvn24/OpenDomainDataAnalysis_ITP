		<content>{      When we set off from school it  
 took us about ten minutes in the car  
 to Rothwell Haigh.                    
      When we got there, the first     
 thing we saw was a{filling station}and
 then a{car sales garage.}After we     
 passed the car sales, we saw a public 
 house called the{John O'Gaunts,}and   
 next to that was a{cafe.              
      A bit further down was a{Baptist 
{church.                               
      After we had travelled a bit we  
 saw a{cemetery}and further down the   
 hill was a parade of shops which      
 contained a{post office,}an{off       
{licence}and a{bank.                   
{                                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
