 large old farmhouses, small cottages  
 with gardens and some modern houses   
 and bungalows.All houses have mains   
{electricity:}there is no main{gas     
 supply but bottled gas is available.  
 Most houses have{mains water}but a few
 still depend on{pumped water from     
{wells.}In general, the houses and     
 cottages are owner-occupied but a few 
 are rented from large private estates 
 which stretch into this area.A{council
{housing estate}is found in Rye        
 Street.All alterations to existing    
 houses go through the District        
 Planning Office in Malvern, and there 
 are no new housing estates            
 contemplated as it is a restricted    
 area for new buildings. There are no  
 slums in the area.
