		<content>  The farms in the area are mainly big 
 and are mostly individually owned and 
 extensively farmed to grow mainly     
 wheat, barley and hay. They also grow 
 smaller quantities of potatoes, beans 
 and peas.                             
  Most farms have a great deal of      
 machinery and do not need to employ   
 many people. They take on extra       
 employees at harvest time in summer.  
  They do not have many animals, just a
 few for their own use and pleasure.   
 Some have dogs for hunting and        
 shooting pigeons, rabbits, pheasants  
 and ducks. Fox hunting is not the same
 as they ride horses wearing special   
 clothes and the dogs kill the fox when
 it is cornered.                       
  There is a vet in the village who    
 looks after the animals.
