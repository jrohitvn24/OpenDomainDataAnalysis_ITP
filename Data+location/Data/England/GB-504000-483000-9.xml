		<title>09SCHOOLS IN EASTFIELD</title>
		<content> There are six schools in the Eastfield
 and Cayton area, five primary and one 
 secondary, Pindar school, named after 
 a local dignitary, George Pindar. This
 takes children from 11 to 16. The     
 others, Braeburn infant, Braeburn     
 junior, Cayton, Overdale and St.      
 George's R.C. cater for children from 
 5 to 11. There is also a nursery unit 
 at Braeburn infants for pre_school    
 children. A school day lasts from     
 about 9 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. with an hour
 for lunch. A good proportion of       
 children stay for school meals while  
 the rest either bring sandwiches or go
 home. There is a wide curriculum      
 ranging from maths and English to     
 environmental studies, music, art and 
 physical education. Most schools also 
 have after school activities such as  
 football, netball, recorder lessons   
 and computer clubs.                   </content>
