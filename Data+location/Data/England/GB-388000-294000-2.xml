		<title>02Housing in Blakenhall Area</title>
		<content>The Blakenhall area is 1.5 kilometres  
to the south of the town centre.  It is
an old area of the town.  It has many  
old terraced houses that were built in 
the nineteenth century.  They are all  
close together and built in long lines.
The streets are named after famous     
people and events.  One of the streets 
is named after Wolverhamptons football 
club.  It is called Wanderers Avenue.  
The houses were named after some of the
players of the day, players who have   
all been forgotten now.                
As the houses were built a long time   
ago they need repairing.  Many of them 
have had new windows put in and new    
roofs.  This makes them look smart from
the outside.  Inside they have had     
things done like rewiring, rooms       
knocking into one and redecorating. The
people who live in them are very happy.
