		<title>06Ecology of Mark</title>
		<content> Some of the most common{trees}in Mark 
 are Ash,Oak,Beech,Apple and once upon 
 a time Elm. Owing to the dreadful     
 Dutch Elm Disease, most of the Elms   
 have disappeared. New young           
 Elms,resistant to the disease are     
 now being planted but it will be 30 to
 40 years before they will be seen     
 again in any great numbers.           
   The most common{wild animals}are    
 rabbits&lt;having recovered from the     
 equally dreaded Miximatosis>,foxes    
 and mink. All these animals can be    
 considered pests but people in general
 dislike setting traps or hunting them.
   Even here deep in the country       
{pollution}rears its ugly head. Locals 
 blame crop spraying and septic tanks  
 for this although it is not really too
 serious a problem here.               
   We are on the edge of the Somerset  
 Levels here. Many birds breed there.  </content>
