 A resident of Quatford had the        
 following views:                      
  "I consider it as a fairly active    
 community, having both a Women's      
 Institute and a Youth Club. It mainly 
 consists of old residents but more    
 young people are moving to the area. I
 find that many previous residents feel
 a compassion for the area and return  
 to attend church services and other   
 activities maintaining their links    
 with the village.Many ex_residents own
 caravans on the nearby sites and so   
 return for short breaks.              
   Transport is a problem especially   
 for school children.They rely solely  
 on their parents for transportation to
 and from Bridgnorth.                  
   Tourists visit the area mainly at   
 weekends,fishing on the River Severn  
 being a major attraction."            </content>
