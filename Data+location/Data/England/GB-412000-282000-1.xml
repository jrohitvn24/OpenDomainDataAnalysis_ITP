		<content> This block situated approximately five
miles from the centre of Birmingham is 
mainly residential, half being in      
Birmingham - half Solihull. As such it 
is well served by shops and schools.   
There are three main shopping areas    
- at Â£The Swan' and Â£The Wheatsheaf'   
on the A.45 (Birmingham to Coventry    
road) which cuts across the northern   
edge of the area, and at Â£The Green'   
in Acocks Green.There are 17 Primary   
and 3 Secondary schools in the block.  
Several parks and playing fields and   
the tree-lined streets help to make a  
pleasant place to live. As well as     
excellent bus services the area is     
served by two stations at Acocks Green 
and Olton on the Birmingham-Paddington 
railway.The largest firm is The Rover  
car company with a factory and a test  
track. Several smaller firms dot the   
western edge of the area.              </content>
