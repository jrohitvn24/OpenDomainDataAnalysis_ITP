		<title>01The River Severn-Gloucester</title>
		<content>      The River Severn dominates this  
 area.It influences the surrounding    
 country and mans attempts to control  
 it.To the south the river divides into
 2 channels,and becomes one 4 miles    
 upstream.The land between is Alney    
 Island and is frequently flooded.     
      This area,until the opening of   
 the Severn Bridge,was for centuries   
 the lowest bridging point across the  
 river.The building of roads and       
 railways has always been beset by     
 major problems.There are now in a 2km 
 area 9 bridges/viaducts.The newest    
 road bridge has a plaque that refers  
 to the first Domesday Book mentioning 
 "a bridge thereabout in 1086".        
      It provides a large open space   
 for Gloucester people to play many    
 sports.It is home for travelling      
 fairground families who return there  
 to live at Pool Meadow in winter.     </content>
