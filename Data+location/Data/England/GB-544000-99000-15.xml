 There are two recreation grounds:     
 these have playing facilities such as 
 swings and slides.  At one of the     
 recreation grounds there is a bowling 
 green, a cricket pitch, a football    
 pitch, a hockey pitch and tennis      
 courts.  Newhaven has its own swimming
 pool which was opened in 1984.  There 
 are no diving facilities there.  At   
 Fort Newhaven there is a play area for
 twelves and unders, amusements and    
 crazy golf.  At the Boys Club there   
 are numerous facilities for teenagers,
 such as darts, pool, table tennis,    
 clubs including karate and indoor     
 football.                             
                                       
 Many local people fish off the two    
 piers.  Once a year TVS sponsor a     
 fishing competition in Newhaven.
