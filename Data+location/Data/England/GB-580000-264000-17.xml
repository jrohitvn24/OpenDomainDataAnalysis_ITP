		<content>  The main industry in the area is     
closely linked to the predominant      
activity which is arable farming. The  
largest employer is a producer of      
agricultural machinery which also      
provides services to local farmers for 
maintenance of their machinery. The    
firm is owned by a German parent       
company and there are strong links with
European markets made possible by the  
direct link of the A45 dual-carriage   
way which gives easy access to the     
growing east coast ports. Nearer to the
town there is a number of industrial   
estates which are designed to encourage
light industry to the area. These range
from light engineering to sweet        
manufacture and were part of the       
'London Overspill' scheme to draw      
population away from the capital to    
developing areas.
