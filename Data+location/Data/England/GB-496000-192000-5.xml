		<title>05PLANTING TREES IN HODGEMOOR</title>
		<content>In 1973 it was Plant a Tree year and   
many schools in Bucks sent children to 
Hodgemoor Woods to help plant trees.In 
the Autumn of 1982 this was repeated   
and the 1st &amp; 2nd year Middle School   
classes from Seer Green Combined School
planted 50 beech trees.Each tree had a 
label with the child's name tied to it.
The foresters had prepared the site and
dug the holes.After planting,each 30 cm
sapling was encased in wire netting to 
keep rabbits and deer away.            
Hodgemoor Woods offers a peaceful sett-
ing for everyone to enjoy whether walk-
ing or horse riding.Path and bridleways
are marked clearly.Examples of byelaws:

ORICAL OR ARCHAEOLOGICAL REMAINS.      
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PICK FLOWERS.
