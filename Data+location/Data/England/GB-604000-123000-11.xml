		<title>11NEW ROMNEY CHURCHES OF PAST</title>
		<content> WHEN THE FIRST DOMESDAY BOOK WAS      
 WRITTEN A RECORD WAS MADE OF FIVE     
 CHURCHES ALL OF THEM QUITE WEALTHY.   
 THEY WERE ALL RULED BY THE ABBOT OF   
 A MONASTERY IN NORMANDY.THE PRIESTS   
 WERE CHOSEN BY HIM AND HAD FRENCH     
 NAMES.THE FIVE CHURCHES WERE ST       
 NICHOLAS ST MARTIN'S ST LAWRENCE,ST   
 JOHN'S AND ST JOHN'S PRIORY.THEY WERE 
 MADE OF STONE FROM FRANCE.ST NICHOLAS 
 STILL STANDS TODAY.THE OTHERS WERE    
 KNOCKED DOWN WHEN THEY WENT SHORT OF  
 MONEY.THE RIVER ROTHER ENTERED THE SEA
 BESIDE THE CHURCH BECAUSE NEW ROMNEY  
 WAS A PORT.IN 1287 THERE WAS A BAD    
 STORM  AND MUD AND PEBBLES BLOCKED THE
 MOUTH AND THE RIVER CHANGED IT'S      
 COURSE AND WENT BY RYE.THE SITES OF   
 THE OLD CHURCHES ST JOHN'S AND ST     
 LAWRENCE ARE NOW COVERED BY HOUSES.
