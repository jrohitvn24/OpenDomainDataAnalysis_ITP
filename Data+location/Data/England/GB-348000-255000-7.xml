		<title>07FORD AND WHARTON</title>
		<content>   Two settlements mentioned in        
{Domesday.                             
   At{Ford}is a small{single-naved     
{church with apse,}completely re-built 
 in 1851, but certainly on Norman      
 foundations. It was thought that the  
 church was a{chapel of ease}for       
 travellers using the ford, especially 
 as the dedication is to St. John of   
 Jerusalem, one of the patron saints of
 travellers.                           
   However, recently a Manpower        
 Services Commission{archaeology survey
 established the remains of a{deserted 
{village}behind{Wharton Court,}just on 
 the other side of the river from Ford.
 There is no trace of a church at      
 Wharton, so it is possible that the   
 villagers crossed the river at the    
 ford to come to church.
