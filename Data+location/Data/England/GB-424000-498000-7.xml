   On Monday while I waited for the    
 kettle to boil, I watched a video,and 
 Mum gave me toast and marmalade.I got 
 my school things together and biked up
 our lane to meet the scool taxi.It    
 also called for Helen,Elizabeth and   
 Scott at the Forest.                  
   In the classroom I gave in my dinner
 money.After assembly we all got on    
 with our maths.Valerie and I did      
 handstands at playtime.Then I wrote   
 about when my Dad,my sister Michelle  
 and I went to a forest and saw a      
 squirrel.School dinner was fish       
 fingers,chips,tomatoes and peas,then  
 rainbow cake and custard.             
   After school the taxi dropped me at 
 the end of the lane and I rode home   
 for tea.I watched some television     
 before going outside to practice      
 gymnastics.Then I had a bath and read.</content>
