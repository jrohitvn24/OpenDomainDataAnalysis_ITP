     The School nature reserve of about
 \HA was created by Jack Doyle, Head of
 Geology, and is dedicated to          
 Mr.E.J.Douglas, the first headmaster  
 of Hadham Hall and a keen naturalist. 
 There are three chalk mounds and one  
 acid mound, and a marshy area.        
 Interesting plants include, common    
 spotted orchid, southern marsh orchid 
 ,twyblade adders tongue fern, yellow  
 rattle, horseshoe vetch, greater broom
 rape and knapweed. Slowworms, frogs,  
 toads and butterflies such as small   
 and larger skipper, ringlets, meadow  
 brown, hedge brown, gatekeeper are    
 found here. Ilpunde Wood has many     
 fairly rare species of plants and     
 animals including pyramid orchid,     
 autumn gentian and roman snails. It is
 hoped that it may become a SSI.
