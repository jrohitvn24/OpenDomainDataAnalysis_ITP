		<title>08Types of Employment in Barby</title>
		<content>The results of a survey concerning the 
occupations of the parents of our      
school children revealed the following:
34% Listed housework as their main     
occupation and this was the largest    
category.  The next two largest        
categories were electrical engineers   
and teachers at 6% each.  Other job    
titles were bank clerk, accountant,    
photographer, engineer, reader in      
mathematics, secretary, sales manager, 
prison officer, driver, painter and    
decorator, farmer, barmaid, dressmaker,
nurse, software support manager and    
catering executive.                    
                                       
The above information makes an         
interesting contrast with the          
occupations undertaken in Barby during 
1874 when blacksmiths, tailors, wheel- 
righs, shoemakers and victuallers      
figured in this self sufficent village.</content>
