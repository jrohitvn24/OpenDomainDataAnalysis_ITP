		<content> Sutton Park, the northern part of     
 which lies within our area, is a      
 nature reserve of great importance    
 both locally and in the West Midlands 
 generally.It is administered by the   
 Birmingham District Council which     
 places much emphasis on its retention 
 as an unspoilt natural habitat.       
 Despite some attempts at encroachment 
 the park is conserved and protected   
 Although traversed by roads, car      
 access is limited mainly to the       
 peripheral roads. A local Friends of  
 the Park Association keeps a watchful 
 eye on the area. Some of the members  
 reside in the district. Climate and   
 weather are in the middle ranges of   
 the unpredictable British climate,    
 although very severe frosts can occur 
 in extreme winter conditions. An      
 interesting ecological development has
 been the appearance of the Urban Fox. </content>
