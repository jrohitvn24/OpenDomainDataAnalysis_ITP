 The{water supply}comes from Stanbridge
 Mill Works, situated beside the River 
 Allen &amp; owned by Bournemouth &amp;        
 District Water Co. First developed in 
 l946-50 when two 27 in. diameter      
 boreholes were sunk in the chalk to   
 the depth of 300 ft. The station is   
 unmanned and is operated by remote    
 control from the company's Alderney   
 Works 11 miles away. Its full         
 potential is 5.5 million gallons per  
 day.  Pumping plant raises water from 
 4 boreholes to Chalbury Reservoir, 112
 ft. higher than Alderney Works. It    
 flows by gravity into network carrying
 water to 80,000 homes over 136 sq.    
 miles for l75,000 people plus 100,000 
 summer visitors.
