		<content> Besides the quoted examples which     
 perhaps reflect the upper more mobile 
 end of the market,there are also a    
 number of estates owned both privately
 and by the local council.             
 Generally the availabity and condition
 of the houses appear to be good.      
 A particular feature of the older     
 properties seems to be the{thatched   
 roof and a thick cob wall.The         
 thatches are expensive to maintain or 
 renew  but the main attractions       
 ..besides their aesthetic quality..are
 the ability to maintain heat during   
 the winter and a surprising coolness  
 during the summer.There  are not many 
 thatchers around now but a few        
 father and son firms can be found in  
 Somerset..and work was going on in    
 nearby Pitminster in 1985 for example.
