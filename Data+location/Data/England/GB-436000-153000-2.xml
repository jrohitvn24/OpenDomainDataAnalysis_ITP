		<title>02HURSTBOURNE TARRANT-VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{Hurstbourne Tarrant}is a village in   
 North Hampshire. There has been a     
 village here since Saxon times.People 
 settled here because there was water  
 and it was a place where several      
 routes crossed.                       
 At the bottom of the hill to the south
 of the village, near the bridge over  
 the bourne, there are two Sarcen      
 stones.                               
 A long time ago the whole valley was  
 marshy, and these stones would have   
 shown travellers where to cross the   
 marsh. They might have been used as   
 stepping stones.                      
 You can see where the road has been   
 built up to cross the bridge. The hill
 used to be even steeper than it is    
 now.
