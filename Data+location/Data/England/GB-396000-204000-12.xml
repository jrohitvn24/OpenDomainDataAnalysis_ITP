		<title>12The School</title>
		<content>   The School was founded in 1867 as a 
 church School for the education of the
 children of Daglingworth.  In recent  
 years children have come to it from   
 other villages, some from as much as  
 four miles away brought in by School  
 bus.                                  
   Although the School is now          
 controlled by the Education Committee,
 we have kept our connections with the 
 Church and children have a service or 
 concert in the Church at least once a 
 year.                                 
   During the past 2 years the numbers 
 of children have dropped below 20 and 
 the Education Committee have proposed 
 that it should be closed in July l986.
   The School, which had the head      
 teacher's house attached, has a       
 playground in front and a small garden
 at the back.
