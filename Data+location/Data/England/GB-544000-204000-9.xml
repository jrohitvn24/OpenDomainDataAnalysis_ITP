		<title>09RYE HILL ENCLOSURE</title>
		<content> After the end of the war in 1945,most 
 of Rye Hill was sold in one parcel to 
 the neighbouring farm.The part with   
 the pond in it suffered a different   
 fate.A house was built next to the    
 road and its owners also bought the   
 pond,which is now an attractive       
 feature of their garden.              
 Also on the Common were two houses    
 surrounded by a moat:this may have    
 been built so that grazing animals did
 not enter their gardens.Only the      
 foundations of the buildings are now  
 visible.
