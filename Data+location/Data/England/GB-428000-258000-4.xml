		<title>04The M40 in block 04280258</title>
		<content>  The proposed M40 will cut through the
 north east corner of our block, with  
 half of a split interchange being     
 constructed where the motorway crosses
 the A41. Southbound traffic will be   
 able to join the motorway from the A41
 and Northbound traffic will be able to
 exit the motorway.                    
  By 2004 it is expected that between  
 45 000 and 53 000 vehicles a day will 
 be using it, 80% being cars and the   
 rest commercial vehicles.             
  This section will cost Â£2m per       
 kilometre to construct and will       
 include bridges over the motorway for 
 Hareway lane, the A41, Oakleywood road
 and the farm acess to Wiggerland Wood 
 Farm. No properties will be destroyed 
 in its construction.                  
  It will have a serious effect on the 
 A41, which will be detrunked as 80% of
 its traffic transfers to the M40      </content>
