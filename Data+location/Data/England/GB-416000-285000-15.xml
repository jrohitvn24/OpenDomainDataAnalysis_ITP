		<title>15Comments on Chelmsley Wood</title>
		<content> The following is a summary of the     
 comments made by 11 year old children 
 who live on Chelmsley Wood. Some      
 disliked certain areas because of:    
 graffiti on walls; broken glass and   
 rubbish left scattered on the floor;  
 no places to play(if you play outside 
 houses you risked being moaned at).   
    The places most liked were: Meriden
 Park with its wood, swings, a slide   
 and a lake with swans and other birds 
 on it; the BMX track; the Solihull    
 Sports Centre because you can do      
 running, weight lifting and football  
 there; Kinghurst Lake because you can 
 fish in it; the library which is nice 
 and quiet to go to and sit and read a 
 book or draw a picture.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
