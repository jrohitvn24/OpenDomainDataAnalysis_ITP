		<title>05Brands Hatch and traffic</title>
		<content> Although the{M20 motorway}passes      
 within 200 metres of the circuit there
 is no exit which directly serves      
{Brands Hatch.                         
                                       
 The{A20 trunk road}passes the west    
 entrance to the circuit but the east  
 entrance can only be accessed from    
 local minor roads and it is this      
 entrance which is used by competitors 
 and most spectators. {Car parking}is  
 provided in fields with access off the
 local road,{Scratchers Lane.          
                                       
 On big race days{traffic congestion}is
 very bad.  Cars are parked everywhere 
 there is space, up to two kilometres  
 away from the track. {Police}have to  
 control every junction for up to five 
 kilometres around.  Clearing the{car  
{parks}can take up to four hours from  
 the end of the race.                  </content>
