		<title>18A DAY IN THE LIFE _ AN ADULT</title>
		<content>   At about 07.00 I get up and have    
 cereal and toast and tea for          
 breakfast. At 07.30 it's time to wake 
 the baby. She also has cereal, but    
 drinks milk. After getting dressed we 
 have some housework to do: washing up,
 hoovering, dusting etc. That is       
 usually followed by a trip into the   
 village to buy some odds and ends of  
 food. Lunch is usually at about 13.00 
 and is a cooked snack. In the after_  
 noon, I may take my daughter to       
 Toddler Group,swimming or to the park.
 Other days we go into Taunton to do   
 the main shopping. At about 17.30 my  
 husband comes home from work and we   
 all have tea. By 20.00 the baby is    
 bathed and in bed. Then I put my feet 
 up and watch television,or read a     
 book,knit or do some sewing. I retire 
 to bed at about 23.00.
