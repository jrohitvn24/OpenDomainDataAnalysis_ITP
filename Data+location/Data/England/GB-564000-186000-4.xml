		<title>04HOUSING IN LAINDON</title>
		<content> On several new estates in Laindon,    
 houses are{subsiding.}This is causing 
 great problems. The houses have to be 
{underpinned}and this is costing       
{Basildon Development Corporation}a lot
 of money. The subsidence is caused by 
{London clay.                          
 Some people complain that the rates   
 and rents of Laindon houses are too   
 high. They say that gardens are too   
 small and the area is too built up.   
 Most houses in Laindon have been built
 by{Basildon Council and Basildon      
{Development Corporation.}There is some
 private housing and a few of the      
 original{"plotland"}bungalows remain. 
 These bungalows have been left to     
 remind us of the early settlers. They 
 came from{London's}grim{East End}to   
 settle in Laindon's lovely            
 countryside.
