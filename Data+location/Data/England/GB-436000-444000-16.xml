		<title>16GAMES CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content> Most children like to play rounders   
 and tig. Tig is a game of catch where 
 one person is 'on' and he/she has to  
 touch or 'tig' someone else. The      
 person who is 'tigged' is then 'on'   
 and so on. They also play football and
 cricket at school. The younger girls  
 play with jigsaws, use typewriters,   
 draw and make books. The boys like    
 playing wallball and spotting cars.   
 With friends they play marbles,       
 boardgames, badminton and tennis.     
 These are raquet games. At home girls 
 play games like Monopoly. Other board 
 games include Formula One and Ludo.   
 Boys like art work, reading, playing, 
 badminton, golf, gardening, fishing   
 and making things. Girls like visiting
 relations going out for meals.Children
 don't like having their hair washed,  
 going to bed or getting up.
