		<title>06MINCE PIE HALL( Farm)</title>
		<content> Mince Pie Hall was originally built as
 a temporary Manor House before the    
 Civil War in the 11 th Century. It was
 used by King Charles 1 as a hunting   
 lodge. It is now an arable farm which 
 covers 64 acres. It is owned by Mr.C. 
 Ward who has lived there for 20 years.
 He collects guns, books about local   
 history, swords and owns a sheet      
 displaying the names and coats of arms
 of people who fought in the Civil War.
 Mr.Ward lives alone on the farm and   
 employs several labourers.            
 The farm is in fact called Bank farm, 
 but it gets its present name from the 
 shape of its Tower which looks like a 
 mince pie.
