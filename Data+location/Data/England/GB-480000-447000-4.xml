		<content> Today's generation speaks in{slang.}  
 It's done by running words together   
 and changing the meaning of words to  
 suit the situation. For example{Wally.
 This used to be a popular name, today 
 it means an ignorant person. Swear    
 words are frequently used to show     
 dissatisfaction, pleasure or to hurt  
 another person. Many swear words are  
 blasphemous such as "Jesus Wept".     
 A lot of today's speech is from       
 America, like "hassle" which means to 
 trouble.                              
 The upper classes have different      
 accents or styles of pronouncing words
 to show they have been brought up in a
 rich community.                       
 In 1985 it's good being able to speak 
 in more than one foreign language.    
 These languages are taught in schools.
 Speaking foreign languages increases  
 the chances of getting jobs abroad.   </content>
