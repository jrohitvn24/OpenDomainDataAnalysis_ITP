		<title>04Flora - Broxwood Area</title>
		<content> This is a very rich area for wild     
 flowers and over 50 varieties have    
 been noted locally - the most common  
 being primroses, wild daffodils and   
 cow parsley.                          
                                       
 The trees are mainly oak, ash, willow 
 and chestnut and in the small woods   
 spruce is planted. The hedgerow trees 
 include holly, hazel, dogwood,        
 hawthorn, blackthorn (otherwise known 
 as sloe), goatwillow, ash, oak and    
 elderberry. Honeysuckle, old man's    
 beard (wild clematis) and bramble     
 abound, and it is possible to see     
 mistletoe growing on trees in         
 orchards. Unfortunately all the elms  
 have been killed by Dutch elm disease 
 in the last few years.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
