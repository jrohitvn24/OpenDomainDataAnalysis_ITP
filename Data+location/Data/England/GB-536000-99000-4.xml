		<title>04Telscombe Village</title>
		<content> Telscombe is a very small quiet       
 village.It has a small Saxon church   
 which is called the church of St.     
 Lawrence.The wooden church door has   
 lots of delicate engraving on it. The 
 rector since 1976 has been the Rev.   
 J.G. Holmes.They have no shops in the 
 village. There are some old gas street
 lamps which have now got light bulbs. 
 There is one farm that keeps          
 horses,sheep, and pigs. Outside the   
 village the road is very bumpy so not 
 a lot of people drive on it as it     
 is not made up. There is an old school
 house with a sign on it.The old school
 is not used as a school anymore.The   
 oak cottage is very old.It is covered 
 in grass and weeds and the garden is  
 over grown.
