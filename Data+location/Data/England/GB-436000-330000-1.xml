		<title>01South east Derby</title>
		<content> This area embraces a mixture of       
 residential, industrial and farming   
 land on the edge of the city of Derby.
 The industrial is dominated by Rolls  
 Royce, the aero-engine makers.They are
 the main employers in the area. Other 
 employers include a bakery and a      
 swimwear factory.                     
 Housing varies from Victorian villas  
 through interwar "semis"and postwar   
 council estates(including "prefab"    
 bungalows well past their original    
 design life) to modern low-energy     
 houses on estates still being built.  
 Beyond the houses and factories land  
 is still farmed within the city       
 boundary - mainly as grazing land but 
 with a few arable fields.             
 Large tracts of land on the edge of   
 the built up area are occupied by     
 schools and their playing fields.
