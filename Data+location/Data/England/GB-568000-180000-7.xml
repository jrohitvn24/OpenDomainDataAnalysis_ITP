		<content>   Shell Haven and Coryton oil         
 refineries dominate the area in terms 
 of size, but not in employment.A wide 
 range of smaller companies in the     
 manufacturing and service sectors,    
 especially the latter, offer job      
 possibilities.The making of clothes   
 and window units, car repair and      
 haulage, are some examples.           
   Even so, many people have jobs in   
 London, as Stanford lies on the       
 Tilbury rail loop, which is connected 
 to the main Fenchurch St.- Shoebury   
 line.                                 
   The A13 Southend to London road and 
 the A1014 'Manorway' are the major    
 roads.The A1014, which is dual        
 carriageway, was built to link the    
 refineries with the A13. Previously,  
 heavy tankers had to go through       
 central Stanford, a slower and        
 potentially more dangerous journey.   </content>
