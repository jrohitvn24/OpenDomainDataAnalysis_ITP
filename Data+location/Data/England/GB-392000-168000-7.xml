		<content>      The majority of this area is not 
 served by Public Transport. The A342  
 which runs North South to the east of 
 the area is on a bus route between    
 Devizes and Chippenham.               
      The remaining roads in the area  
 are narrow country lanes and a heavy  
 reliance is placed upon{private       
{cars,bicycles and foot as the modes of
{transport.                            
      The road which runs East-West    
 from Sandy Lane to Lacock through the 
 block is very busy for its size, since
 it provides a useful cut off between  
 the A342 and the A350 and             
 beyond.During the peak of the tourist 
 season this leads to{congestion on the
{Pack Horse Bridge}across the River    
 Avon.                                 
      Transport is provided by the     
 local authority for Chippenham schools
