		<content> On Thursday I woke up at 7.30 a m,    
 dressed, had my breakfast, washed my  
 face and hands then sat down to watch 
 the television until 8.10 a m, when I 
 left the house to go to{school.}Mum   
 took me in the car. I met all my      
 friends in the playground and played  
 with them until the bell went. At 9.0 
 a m I held the door open for children 
 to go in. I went into class, put my   
 chair down and took out my books ready
 for lessons.                          
 I finished school at 3.50 p m, and my 
 Mum collected me by car. At home I    
 changed out of my{school uniform}and  
 went downstairs until it was time for 
 tea. After tea I went out on my bike  
 to the{BMX}track. At 7.30 p m, I went 
 back indoors and watched{television   
 until my bathtime. At 9.00 p m I went 
 to bed.                               
                                       </content>
