		<content>MILLBROOK JUNIOR SCHOOL AIMS TO BE A   
HAPPY,LIVELY SCHOOL FOR WE BELIEVE THAT
A CHILD'S ATTITUDE TO LEARNING IS OF   
THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE.THE SCHOOL     
SEEKS A HIGH STANDARD OF DISCIPLINE,   
NOT THROUGH FEAR OF PUNISHMENT BUT     
FROM RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER AND IN THE
KNOWLEDGE THAT A CERTAIN CONDUCT OF    
BEHAVIOUR IS THE NORM.THE CURRICULUM IS
BROAD,BEING BOTH ACADEMIC AND          
PRACTICAL,AND RELEVANT IN THAT THE     
PUPILS'TASKS ARE NOT DIVORCED FROM THE 
WORLD OUTSIDE SCHOOL. IT IS OUR        
INTENTION THAT THE TASKS GIVEN TO      
PUPILS SHOULD MATCH THEIR MATURITY AND 
INTELLIGENCE IN ORDER TO CAPITALISE THE
POTENTIAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL.IT IS AN   
OPEN SCHOOL,WELCOMING PARENTAL         
INVOLVEMENT AND ENCOURAGING PARENTS TO 
SUPPORT BOTH THEIR CHILD AND THEIR     
CHILD'S TEACHER.
