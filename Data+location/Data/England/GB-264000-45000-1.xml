		<content> A highly cultivated section of South  
 Hams mechanised farm land intersected 
 by narrow lanes and valleys with two  
 small villages with churches, three   
 ancient Inns and odd hamlets.  There  
 are thirteen farms comprising mainly  
 large areas of arable sown with corn  
 and rotated with roots, vegetables and
 grass land. Grazing is mainly for     
 sheep.  There are four dairy herds    
 principally Friesians.  cows and sheep
 are frequently herded from Land       
 Rovers.  Poultry production is also in
 evience and Pigs are few.  Horses are 
 for sport.  Narrow lanes of great     
 antiquity running between neat banked 
 hedges cut by mechanical slashers are 
 a feature.  Deep valleys have         
 perrenial streams.  The area is       
 peopled by farmers, professional      
 families, retired couples single      
 people and seasonal holiday makers.   </content>
