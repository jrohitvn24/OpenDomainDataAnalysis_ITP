		<title>06Caring for the Elderly</title>
		<content>     Our school has built up over the  
years close links with the residents of
Stanton House, which is a nearby       
sheltered housing scheme for the       
elderly.   Each year, at Christmas, the
residents are collected from their     
flats and brought to school where their
hosts are the fourth-year children.    
They have afternoon tea, and are then  
entertained by the children before     
returning home.                        
     Also, in early October, the       
children are asked to bring to school  
items of food for our Harvest          
Thanksgiving.   Afterwards the food is 
distributed to local elderly and lonely
people.                                
     The school also has links with the
George Rider home for the elderly.     
These have been both formal and        
informal, involving various children in
fund-raising and social activities.    </content>
