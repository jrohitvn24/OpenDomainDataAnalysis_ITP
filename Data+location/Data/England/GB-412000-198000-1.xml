		<title>01Description of SW Fairford</title>
		<content> In the north-east corner of the area  
 is the west part of Fairford.From here
{uplands}extend westwards to Meysey    
 Hampton.North and south of this is    
 flatter and lower land. In the south  
 of the area is Fairford Airfield.     
   Most of the fields are planted with 
{crops,}the rest are left for pasture. 
 There are a few clumps of trees in    
 this area,but generally the trees are 
 mature are isolated.Between the fields
 are narrow country lanes,lined with   
 hedges,from which grow many trees.    
   The River Coln flows north-south    
 through Fairford before joining the   
 Thames.As{communications through this 
{area run east-west}the River Coln has 
 not been made a feature in the same   
 way as in neighbouring Bibury.
