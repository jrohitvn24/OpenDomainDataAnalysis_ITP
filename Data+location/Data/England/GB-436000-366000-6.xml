		<content>  {Bole Hill Quarry}was working before 
 The Great War. It now occupies a 12   
 acre site and is owned by Mr          
 Gregory, who employs 50 people. The   
 quarry works throughout the year and  
 produces, on average, 30 tonnes of    
 stone a day. These are the 5 types of 
 stone: Stancliffe, Stanton, Dumphries,
 Lacomby, and Limestone.               
   At{Bole Hill}there are 2 polishers, 
 10 saws, various hand tools, forklift 
 trucks and a lathe. This machinery is 
 not expensive to keep but it needs    
 regular oil changing and maintenance. 
   Stone is sent from{Bole Hill}all    
 over the world, but mostly to Scotland
 and the Midlands.  It is used for     
 restoration work, arches, walls, fire-
 places and carvings.
