		<title>18WEST END FARM</title>
		<content>       {                               
{  }West End Farm is typical of the two
 main types of farm in the area.This is
 a mixed type of farm consisting of    
 arable farming and a dairy herd of    
 thirty four cows all milked by        
 machine.                              
   In the summer months Mr.Lovely, the 
 farmer, takes his cattle out to graze 
 in the fields which helps to produce a
 greater milk yield.During the winter  
 months the cattle are brought into the
 large farm buildings and fed on silage
 and cattle cake.The milk is sent by   
 tanker to Northern Dairies at         
 Bramley.Here the milk is packed into  
 cartons and sent to supermarkets.     
 Bullocks born on the farm are sold as 
 beef cattle to other farmers.A new    
 barn,built at the cost of three       
 thousand pounds stores much of his    
 machinery.                            </content>
