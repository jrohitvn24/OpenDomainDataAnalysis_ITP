		<content> After that, Miss Walters will switch  
 on the radio and we listen to "In the 
 News".I wrote a letter to them about  
 keeping dolphins and whales in        
 swimming pools. I think it's cruel.   
 After I'd written the letter it was   
 dinner break. For dinner we had thin  
 chips , mince with melted cheese and  
 noodles on top with some vegetables   
 and for afters we had caramel tart.   
 Then we'd have our dinner break and   
 probably we would play "Port and      
 Starboard". Next comes assembly and we
 have a story and a song. Then we get  
 back to work, followed by another     
 playtime at 2.30.p.m. Then we come in,
 work for a little while and then have 
 a story. The story we're listening to 
 is called "The Fox Busters" by        
 Dick King-Smith but now we've finished
 it off. After the story it's half past
 three, time for school to finish.     </content>
