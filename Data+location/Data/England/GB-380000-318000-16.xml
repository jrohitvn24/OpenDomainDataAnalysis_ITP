		<title>16Gnosall Fire Station</title>
		<content>  Gnosall has a retained fire service, 
which means that it is part time. The  
firemen must live within one mile of   
the fire station. When there is a call,
bells ring in the station and a tape   
plays to tell the men where to go. The 
firemen carry a pocket alerter which   
bleeps when there is a call. When the  
alert sounds the men have 3 minutes to 
get to the station. They should be     
dressed and ready to turn out in four  
minutes. In a year there are about 150 
calls on average. There are always 4   
firemen available.                     
  The most commom calls in winter are  
to chimney fires. Firemen also go to   
farm fires, house fires and road       
traffic accidents. Firemen practice    
fire drills twice a week. The most     
unusual calls have been to rescue a    
parrot and to get bees out of a        
chimney.                               </content>
