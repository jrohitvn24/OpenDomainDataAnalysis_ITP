		<title>18LICHFIELD CANALS</title>
		<content>   There is a small Marina on the      
Coventry canal at Streethay, developed 
from what was once a maltings.Part of  
the area was once a coal yard.The coal 
was carried in barges pulled by horses.
The Marina today is run by a man and   
his wife.They do small repairs and some
repainting.The wife paints the         
decorations on the "narrowboats" in the
traditional style of roses and castles.
   The average number of "narrowboats" 
and motor cruisers moored at the Marina
is about 15 on any one day.            
   The Lichfield canal Cruising Club   
has a clubhouse by the canal at        
Huddlesford and a total of sixty-five  
motor cruisers and "narrowboats" with  
diesel engines.
