		<content> We made a{survey of the working       
{parents}of our three{third year       
{classes.}Results from it showed that  
 one third of them went out of{March}to
 work,many were{employed}by{Fenland    
{Hal,}few worked on{farms}or{railway.  
{Factories}were planned to make jobs.  
{Fenland's deputy chief planning       
{officer}invited us to see how the     
{planning committee}operated in{Fenland
{Hall.}We became the{"planning         
{committee"}for an afternoon. 'I was   
 vice chairman for the{committee.}It   
 was very comfortable sitting up high  
 in his seat.My job was{counting}the   
 "no"votes. The room looked like a     
 court. We had to decide whether an    
 applicant could go ahead with his     
 plans. There were many{applicants.    
{Some asked to build houses}or         
{factories}and one asked to place a    
{picnic area'.   }Nicola Styles.       </content>
