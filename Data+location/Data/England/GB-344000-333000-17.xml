 On July 18th.&amp; 19th.,1985, Lyneal

 at Ellesmere College Arts Centre.     
 The play was written and music        
 composed by J.Hartley,P. Panting &amp; E. 
 Williams and was based on the Lewis   
 Carroll books.                        
                                       
 The performance was in front of 2 full
 houses &amp; was a huge success. Many in  
 the audiences had never seen children 
 perform at such a high level.         
                                       
 All the children(32) had parts and    
 many had 2 or 3 as there were almost  
 60 roles. The 2 teachers had parts too
 and several adults sung or read poems.
 The play lasted for just over 1.5     
 hours, beginning at 7.30pm.           
 A 9 year old girl,Michelle Evans, took
 the part of Alice.                    </content>
