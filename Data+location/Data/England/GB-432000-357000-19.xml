		<title>19My House By Emma Sykes</title>
		<content>   I live in a house in Holloway two   
 hundred years old .It was originally  
 two cottages and later changed into a 
 public house and  more recently       
 converted into one large house.       
   It has three double bedrooms,with a 
 long corridor connecting  one bedroom 
 to the landing, one bathroom and a    
 large loft area. It has four rooms    
 downstairs and two staircases though  
 one of these was removed to make more 
 space in the kitchen. In about{1979}we
 added a porch and playroom .          
   Most of the windows still have      
 shutters and some of the rooms have   
 their wooden ceiling beams exposed.   
 The downstairs rooms have largeish    
 ingle-nook style fireplaces and at one
 time a cast iron range could be       
 found in the kitchen. The original    
 doors, some of which still exist were 
 made from tongue and groove planking. </content>
