In Chorley as in many parts of         
Lancashire there is a mixture of Church
and State schools.                     
There are nine Church primary schools, 
and these are made up of five Church of
England schools and four Roman Catholic
schools. The majority of the managers  
in these schools are appointed by the  
respective denominations.              
The majority of the managers of the    
state schools are really political     
appointees.                            
The church schools are;'All Saints C.E.
St.Laurence's C.E. Sacred Heart R.C.   
St.George's C.E. St.Jame's C.E.        
St.Joseph's R.C. St.Mary's R.C.        
St.Gregory's R.C. and St.Peter's C.E.  
Their total child population is        
approximatly 1600 children.
