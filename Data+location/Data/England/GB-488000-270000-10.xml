		<title>10Finedon  Donna's Special Day</title>
		<content>  On Tuesday May 28th I woke up and Nan
was in the bedroom looking out of the  
window.She was staying with us because 
our mum was in hospital having another 
baby.                                  
  When I was dressed I went downstairs 
to have breakfast.I had some           
cornflakes.After breakfast my sister,  
my nan and I went to the stores to get 
some lunch for us all.Dad looked after 
the other children.When it was near    
lunchtime my dad went to the hospital  
to visit my mum.He came back and told  
us she had had a little boy.My youngest
sister cried because she wanted a girl.
Dad said that my mum was not allowed   
home until the next day.               
  We called the baby Michael Trefor    
Gareth.My dad said that when Michael   
was older he would teach us all how to 
play badminton and snooker. I now had  
3 sisters and 2 brothers.              </content>
