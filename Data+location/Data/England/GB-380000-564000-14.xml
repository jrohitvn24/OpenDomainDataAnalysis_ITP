		<content> This former farmhouse is a{rest home  
 for Senior Citizens. It is owned by   
 Mr.&amp; Mrs.Moore, the latter being a    
 State Registered Nurse. The Home has  
 15 guests. Three are over{90}&amp; include
 Miss Shortridge. She formerly taught  
 Maths. at Queen Elizabeth Grammar     
 School, Hexham.The{farm}buildings are 
 being removed or restored after a fire
 six years ago. Much of the stone has  
 been sold to build walls &amp; houses. The
 name of the house indicates that a    
{pele tower}once stood there. During   
{Border raids}the livestock were put on
 the ground floor and people on the    
 higher storeys; doors were barred. A  
 sculpted, low-relief{Roman}stone, mud 
 weathered, was taken in 1973 to       
 Vindolanda from a Peelwell barn,      
 suggesting that Peelwell was built in 
 part from stone taken from{Hadrian's  
{Wall.                                 </content>
