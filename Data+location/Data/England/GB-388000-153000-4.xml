		<content>      The farms in the block are mainly
 independent dairy farms of approx 200 
 acres, with dairy herds of 80 to 200  
 friesian cows N.B. (Not all the acres 
 quoted fall within the block and some 
 farms own land well outside the       
 locality _. eg. Raydown Farm owns     
 land in Potterne and Dunge farm  has  
 land at Edington.> A few farms have   
 been broken up into small units and   
 are owned by the council. Manor farm  
 at the end of West Ashton village is  
 one of these.                         
      Two farms are notably larger than
 the rest _ East Town Farm.approx 600  
 acres. and Fulling Bridge Farm approx 
 500 acres. Both farms are owned  by   
 business men with interests other than
 farming. East Town is the only        
 completely arable farm in the block   
 growing wheat,barley,rape and field   
 beans.                                </content>
