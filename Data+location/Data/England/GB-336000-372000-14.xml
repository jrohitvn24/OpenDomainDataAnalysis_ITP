		<content> The impact of Leisure Centres on the  
 area is obvious.Both adults &amp; children
 travel to centres at Chester,Ellesmere
 Port,Neston &amp; Deeside where the most  
 popular activities are swimming,      
 badminton,ice &amp; roller skating,ballet 
 &amp; disco dancing.Cars are used as there
 is no convenient public transport.The 
 two works clubs in Capenhurst at BNFL 
 and The Electricity Council Research  
 Centre are well used by villagers as  
 there is no local public house.Locals 
 also make use of their sporting       
 facilities such as bowling greens.For 
 young people a weekly Youth Club has  
 started meeting in the Village Hall.  
 Chester has the overall best service  
 for entertainment with night clubs,   
 cinemas,dico halls,Bingo,Leisure      
 Centres and Museums.With its large    
 variety of shops,pubs and eating      
 places it is ideal for a family outing</content>
