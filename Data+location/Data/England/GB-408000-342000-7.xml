		<title>07Chemicals used on Farms.</title>
		<content>We went to visit the place where they  
sell supplies to farmers.We found lots 
of chemicals being used, for instance  
weed killers are sprayed onto crops    
because farmers can't afford to pay    
workers to weed their fields.We are    
worried about the long term effects of 
chemicals that get sprayed onto the    
crops. The use of chemicals has grown  
much more widespread during the        
last 20 years.                         
When they sow wheat or barley or       
swedes, they spray on some Fungicide   
to stop mildew. Then  later on they    
put on some  Fertilizer - (nitrogen)   
which makes it grow quicker and        
stronger. Then they put on some Â£Â£Pre  
Harvest '' Chemical, it kills the weeds
again. Farmers also use chemicals in   
sprays on  animals : For instance,     
Â£Â£Deltamethrin''-kills lice on cows    
and pigsÂ£Â£Fenbendazole''-sheep wormer. </content>
