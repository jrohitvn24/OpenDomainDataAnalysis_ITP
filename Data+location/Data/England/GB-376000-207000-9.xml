		<title>09Whitminster Court.</title>
		<content> Whitminster has had an Assize Court   
 for many years. Nowadays the majority 
 of cases heard here are speeding      
 offences from the nearby M5. Some very
 famous people have been tried for     
 speeding in this court, including     
 members of the Royal Family who live  
 in the area.                          
                                       
 There are fifteen magistrates based at
 the court. Newspaper reporters are    
 allowed in but if you are under 17 you
 can't go in.                          
                                       
 There used to be a cell and a         
 fingerprint room at the Court but     
 these are not used any more.          
                                       
 The Court building is a new modern    
 structure and is not liked by locals  
 who feel that it is out of keeping    
 with the rest of the village.         </content>
