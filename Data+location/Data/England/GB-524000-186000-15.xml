		<title>15THE SPANIARDS INN</title>
		<content> In {Spaniards Road}there is an old    
 toll gate. This was once at the       
 entrance to the road running through  
 the estate of the {Bishop of London,} 
 right opposite {Spaniards Inn.}It is  
 said that {Dick Turpin}used Spaniards 
 Inn as a hide out. The landlord used  
 to give him the the keys to the       
 stables so that he could hide and make
 a quick getaway if necessary. This Inn
 was also used by the {Gordon Rioters} 
 in 1780, when the landlord gave the   
 rioters so much alcohol that they     
 became incapable of resisting the     
 troops and so saved {Kenwood House.}  
 from destruction.                     
    The Inn got its name from the      
 Spanish Ambassador who took a house   
 there to shelter from the plague in   
 the reign of James I.
