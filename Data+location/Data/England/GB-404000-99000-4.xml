		<title>04EDUCATION READING SCHEME</title>
		<content>{Ginn 360}is a{reading scheme}which    
 improves reading, comprehension and   
 memory. All the set books and         
 extension readers are kept on a       
 trolley with the work cards for each  
 book. Catalogue cards help children   
 to find the books and cards easily.   
 We (Colin and Robert) push the trolley
 round to the seven first year classes.
 Each class uses it twice a week.      
 How we use the scheme. First we find  
 a book and the work sheets to go with 
 it, then we read the book carefully   
 before answering the questions in the 
 work book. Finally we do the cards,   
 mark our work and go on to the next   
 book. There is also a record sheet    
 which we mark (by colouring in        
 squares) to show exactly where we are 
 in the scheme. We shall continue      
 to use the same scheme in our second  
 year at school.                       </content>
