		<content>  This area is mainly old urban        
 property with parkland,lakes,open     
 space and woodland.This provides many 
 habitats for various creatures.Amongst
 the less common birds seen in the last
 year are Goldfinch, Redwing           
 and Blackcap. Tufted Duck and Pochard 
 are regular winter visitors. Poplar   
 and Lime line many roads and are thus 
 the commonest trees. Many butterflies 
 and moths can be found, including     
 Peacock and Poplar Hawk moth          
 (declining because of air pollution). 
 Amounts of over 100 mg per m3 of smoke
 pollution have been recorded.         
 Rainwater samples usually measure ptt 
 6-acidic. Little lichen except for    
 Lecanora, due to high air pollution.  
 Newsham Park lake shows but slight    
 pollution, thus there is a large range
 freshwater creatures inc. caddis      
 larvae and freshwater shrimp.         </content>
