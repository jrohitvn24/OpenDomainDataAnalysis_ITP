		<content> The block lies north of the river     
 Ruther and south of Bexley and        
 Blackdown hills, bounded on the east  
 by Petworth Park. Nearly a third of   
 area is woodland, mainly oak, and the 
 rest if farmland devoted to pasture of
 cattle and sheep but with some wheat  
 and barley.  The river Lod flows      
 southward through the block and the   
 land gently undulates betwen 25 and   
 135 metres in elevation.  It contains 
 one village, Lodsworth, midway between
 Midhurst and Petworth some 4 miles    
 from each, its popultion is about 500,
 most of those who work are employed   
 outside the block.  The village is    
 served by a general store and post    
 office, a repair garage, a public     
 house and village hall. The parish    
 church lies just outside the block. A 
 bus service connects with Midurst,    
 Petworth and Chichester.              </content>
