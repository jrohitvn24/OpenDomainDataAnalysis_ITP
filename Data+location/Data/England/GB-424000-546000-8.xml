		<content>      One of the children had this to  
 say about the visit of the Police     
 Horses : " 7th June - There were two  
 of them. One was brown, he was 15     
 years old and his name was Sterling.  
 The other horse was white, he was 20  
 years old and his name was Eddiscome. 
 P.C Hewitson rode Eddiscome and P.C   
 Jefferson rode Sterling. Sterling was 
 bigger than Eddiscome and his legs    
 were fatter and stronger but Eddiscome
 was Police Horse of the Year.         
      Police horses have to train for  
 about 12-18 months. They have to learn
 to walk backwards and sideways and    
 have to keep crowds under control."   
                                       
                                       
                                       
               By Sarah Wright.
