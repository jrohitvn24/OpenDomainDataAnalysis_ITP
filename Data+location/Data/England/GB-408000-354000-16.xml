		<title>16My visit to Wetton</title>
		<content>{Entertainment}                        
     There is only one public house in 
Wetton.  It is called 'Ye Olde Royal   
Oak'.  In the pub they play Dominoes   
and Darts.  You could always walk      
around Wetton for enjoyment, for there 
are many walks.                        
                                       
{Landscape}                            
     The landscape at Wetton is very   
hilly and the woodland is very spread  
out.                                   
                                       
{Facilities}                           
     In Wetton there is a Post Office  
and a shop.  There are benches at the  
side of the road for people to sit on. 
There are also litter bins to put      
rubbish in.  There is not a public     
telephone.  Wetton is a nice village   
and I would like to live there.
