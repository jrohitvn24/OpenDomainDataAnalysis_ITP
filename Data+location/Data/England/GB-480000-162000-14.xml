		<title>14Gravel Extraction</title>
		<content>    We visited a quarry owned by{Hall  
{Aggregates}because it was the only    
 industry in our area. The plant is    
 situated along the{River Blackwater.  
 The processing plant is connected to  
 the extraction area by a thousand feet
 long conveyer belt. The gravel is     
 extracted for building materials such 
 as concrete and cement.{A dragline    
{crane}removes the top soil and peat   
 revealing a layer of gravel. Compact  
{fossilized wood}was found inbetween   
 the layers of peat and gravel. It was 
 possibly{10,000 years old.}The gravel 
 is scooped up and put into a hopper   
 which transfers it to the conveyer    
 belt. When it reaches the processing  
 plant the gravel is washed and graded 
 into different sizes. Oversized pieces
 are crushed to a useful size. The     
 residue of sand and water is pumped   
 into piles to dry ready for use.      </content>
