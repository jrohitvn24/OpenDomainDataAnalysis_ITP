		<content>{POLLUTION}:-Pesticides are washed into
 rivers, but this can take anything up 
 to ten years.                         
{DAIRY-FARMING}:-Woodgate often has to 
 import milk when a lot is drunk. There
 are 76 dairy cows on the farm which   
 give birth to 76 calves per annum. The
 farm produces 5200 gallons per year.  
 The average lifespan of a cow is 8    
 years in which time it will produce 6 
 calves. Â£220 is spent on each cow each
 year.                                 
{FARM BUILDINGS}:-There are still old  
 barns around, most oak-framed ones of 
 the Napoleonic era are being replaced 
 by concrete ones. There was a surge of
 modern farm buildings in the 1960's.  
 EVENTS:-There are not many events, but
 annually the Ashdown weekend is held  
 in the Danehill recreational grounds.
