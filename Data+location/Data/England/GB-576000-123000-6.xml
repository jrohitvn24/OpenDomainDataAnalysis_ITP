		<title>06PARK FARM</title>
		<content>   Park Farm is just outside Bodiam,   
 spanning the A229.The farm has been in
 the Bailey family for two generations.
 The farm has 550 acres of land        
 including 100 acres of woods. This    
 land is mainly used for grazing       
 cattle; and wheat and oil seed rape   
 are grown. Grass is used for making   
 forage and hay during the summer for  
 feeding the cows in the winter.       
   Mr Bailey employs four farm hands   
 who help run the farm. The machinery  
 used includes tractors, ploughs, a    
 hay-baler, trailers and a combine     
 harvester. The cows are milked in a   
 mechanized parlour. Wheat, oil seed   
 rape and 650,000 litres of milk per   
 year are sold.                        
   Since 1981 the family has lived in a
 converted oast and also run a popular 
 camp site on a small area of the farm.
