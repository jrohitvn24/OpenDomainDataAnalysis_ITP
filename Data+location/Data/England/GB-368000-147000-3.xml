		<content>  On{Monday 13th}of{May}some children  
 from Class One visited the  {Police   
{Station.}  We asked him some questions
 aboat his work.   He showed us some of
 his{fire proof}clothes.   We asked him
 what he liked best in his job and he  
 said he enjoyed helping people.       
      Altogether there was seven in our
 group. First of all we drew the police
 house.  Two of the boys in our group  
 put the{hand-cuffs}on. We asked him if
 he had ever broken his{truncheon}and  
 he said ,  "No but I have damaged it."
         We all had a go at holding the
 truncheon.     We all said that it was
 very heavy.  One of the girls drew our
 policeman. He said,"Can I have a look 
 please?"      She was laughing because
 it was funny.  He started being a     
 policeman when he was nineteen.  He   
 joined the cadets when he was         
 seventeen.                            </content>
