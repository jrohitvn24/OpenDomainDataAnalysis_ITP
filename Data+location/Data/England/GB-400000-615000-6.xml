		<content>  There are several types of sheep.    
 The most popular breeds are Cheviot   
 and Border Leicester sheep.The sheep  
 (ewes)have have their lambs by April. 
 The sheep normally just roam around   
 the hills all day,but always return to
 their own area.The Cheviot is valuble 
  because it is a good dual-purpose    
 sheep for producing best quality      
 mutton and wool. The sheep take their 
 name from the Cheviot Hills between   
 England and Scotland.They are         
 distinguished by a hairless white face
  and straight ears.                   
       The Border Leicester is a very  
 big sheep distinguished by high       
 carriage of the head and what could be
 described as a Roman nose.
