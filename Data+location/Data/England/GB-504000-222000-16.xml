		<title>16LEAGRAVE STATION</title>
		<content> Leagrave Railway Station built in 1870
 has roughly 7 000 people travelling a 
 week.The busiest day is Monday,the    
 quietest is Sunday.The earliest train 
 is 5.48a.m.The district traffic       
 manager does like his job.He works    
 shifts from 6.30a.m. to 1.30p.m.The   
 station is termed as a local          
 station.There are no peak periods     
 because people work flexy hours,in    
 London offices,though in the mornings 
 it is busy to about 10.00a.m. and in  
 the evenings 7.30p.m.It takes         
 35mins,from Leagrave to London and    
 costs Â£4.20 per day.The traffic       
 manager's most difficult task is to   
 deal with accidents on the line.Most  
 people I asked found that electric    
 trains are much better than diesel    
 because it offers a quicker           
 service.Lots of people take their cars
 to the station.                       </content>
