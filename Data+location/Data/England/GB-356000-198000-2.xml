		<content> Landscape of the Woolaston block.     
   The block of land surveyed by       
 Wyedean School is bounded in the North
 by the main road from Chepstow to     
 St.Briavels, and the River Severn to  
 the S.E.                              
   The block is on a S.E.facing slope  
 which falls steeply to the floodplain 
 of the Severn.                        
   The land use is mostly forestry and 
 farming with scattered cottages and   
 farms. Strict planning control has    
 concentrated all new housing into the 
 main village of Woolaston/Netherend.  
   In the past 20 years all new        
 housing,private and council has been  
 built here, doubling the village's    
 size, making a big social impact on   
 the old villagers. The new villagers  
 have come from all over Britain.
