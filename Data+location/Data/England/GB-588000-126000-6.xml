		<content>{ Rugden}is approached by a long bumpy 
 drive.  The house was built between   
 the 13th and 14th centuries, one barn 
 is the same age as the house and all  
 the buildings are old.  They have     
 between 250 and 300 sheep including   
 the lambs.  They own 11 pheasant - 3  
 cocks and 8 hens and their 3 dogs live
 in an old caravan.  Near the house    
 there is a 25 foot deep well.         
                                       
  At{Ham Green Farm,}Mr. Pudan took us 
 into the old dairy and showed us a    
 milk cooler and a filter to get rid of
 the dirt.  We saw where one of the    
 natural springs on his land is and had
 a look at the calves and the turkey   
 sheds.  Mr. Pudan rode off on his bike
 and showed us the way to the badger   
 sets; there were lots of sets but we  
 did not see any badgers as they are   
 nocturnal.                            </content>
