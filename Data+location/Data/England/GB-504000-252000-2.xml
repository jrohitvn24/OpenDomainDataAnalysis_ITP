		<content>  The parade of shops on Avon Drive is 
 one of two parades which serve the    
 area. It has a supermarket, a green-  
 grocer's, a butcher's, a newsagent's  
 (with sub-post office) and a health   
 food shop. Nearby is the Tiger Moth   
 public house and a garage with        
 servicing.                            
  When interviewed, the present owner  
 of the supermarket, Mr.Patel, stated  
 that 'it is a good area to have a     
 business'. Mr.Cunnington (newsagent)  
 said that they served about one       
 thousand customers each day and that  
 the biggest sales are of cigarettes   
 and cigars. His sub-post office is    
 very busy. His main worry is to stop  
 shop-lifting.                         
  Likewise, Mr.Saint (butcher), Mr.    
 Benson (greengrocer) and Mr.Linganagam
 (health foods) were pleased to be     
 doing business in the area.           </content>
