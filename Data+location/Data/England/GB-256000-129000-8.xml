		<title>08A DAY OUT IN SQUARE ONE</title>
		<content> One Tuesday we went out to explore    
 square one. There were only five of us
 so we had to work quickly. When we    
 arrived we go straight to work and    
 walked up Rumsam Road. While we were  
 walking up Rumsam Road we saw lots of 
 interesting things. We filled in lots 
 of answers on our questionnaires and  
 soon we only had a few questions      
 left to fill in so walked back to the 
 car and drove down to Rock Park where 
 we did our sketches. When we had      
 finished we had a discussion about    
 what we had done during the day. On   
 our way back we sorted out the        
 percentages and when we arrived at    
 school everything was ready to put on 
 paper.
