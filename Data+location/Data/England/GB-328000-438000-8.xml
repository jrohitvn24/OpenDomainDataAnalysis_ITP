		<content>{THE SCHOOL SPONSORED WALK}            
 Every other year our school has a     
 sponsored walk along this stretch of  
 the promenade;we walk six miles each  
 way, so that makes a total walk of    
 twelve miles. The whole school enters,
 including the teachers, and even dogs 
 have been taking part,wearing school  
 scarves. Last year they were banned   
 because one bit a teacher who was     
 riding a bicycle up and down. The     
 smallest children in the school walk  
 only six miles, but all those over 11 
 try to do the full twelve and most of 
 them manage it. The money is usually  
 shared between the Church of England  
 Children's Society and our own school 
 funds. Last time we put some money in 
 our School Bursary Fund, which        
 provides scholarships for children who
 would like to come to our school.
