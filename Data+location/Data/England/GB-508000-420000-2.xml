		<content> The area is very flat. To the north of
 the village, towards the Humber bank  
 is the area known as the Marsh. All of
 the roads in this area are straight, a
 legacy of the 18th century enclosures.
 The land is mainly used for arable    
 farming with{cereals}as the main crop.
 Root crops are extensively grown,     
 particularly{sugar beet.}The yellow   
{oil seed rape}flower is now a feature 
 of the area each spring.{Peas,}which  
 were grown for the Grimsby frozen food
 industry have declined as a major crop
 due to closure of a deep freeze       
 factory there. Some are grown and     
 frozen at factories in Hull but most  
 are now dried for human consumption or
 fed to livestock as a source of       
 protein.{Beans}are also grown. A small
 amount are frozen at Grimsby but most 
 are dried for human and animal        
 consumption.                          </content>
