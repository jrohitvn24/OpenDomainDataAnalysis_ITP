		<title>10GRASS CROPS</title>
		<content> Round bailing was invented in 1980.   
 To start the grass is cut and left for
 a day. Then it is made into rows by a 
 tractor and hay bob.(The hay bob rows 
 up the grass.) Then the bailer bails  
 the grass.The balier is square. When  
 the bail has been made it is picked up
 and taken to the farm, where it is put
 in a bag  until November, then it is  
 fed to the cows. The bail is 4 feet   
 high by 3 feet.The other kind is where
 the grass is mown and picked up by a  
 forager which looks like a box with a 
 tube on.When the grass is picked up it
 is put on a heap until November. You  
 can get 30 round bails from 1 acre.   
 Hay bailing is like round bailing, but
 the bails are 2 feet by 1 foot. The   
 bailer is like a box with a tube on   
 the back. The bails are used for      
 bedding cows in the Winter.From an    
 acre you can get 100 bails.           </content>
