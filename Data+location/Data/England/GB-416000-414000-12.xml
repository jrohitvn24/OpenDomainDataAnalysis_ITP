		<title>12TRADE: Shopping - Waterloo</title>
		<content>   {Waterloo}is a busy shopping centre.
 Lodge's has its main warehouse there, 
 and a large superstore which was      
 converted from a cinema.              
 We carried out a survey of 30 people. 
 This is what we found:{Use of shops:} 
 Daily 9, Weekly 7, Sometimes 14. Nine 
 types of shop were used by people in  
 the survey. All thirty were satisfied 
 with the range and 24 could not think 
 of any improvements to be made.       
{Lodge's} Frank Lodge began by selling 
 candles on the local market. Now there
 are 8 supermarkets plus the main      
 warehouse, altogether employing 225   
 people. The warehouse has an area of  
 30 000 sq ft, the goods are stored in 
 pallets and a record is kept. The     
 superstore sells a full range of      
 products, and best sellers include    
 cereals, cheese, sausages, baked      
 beans, bread and potatoes.            </content>
