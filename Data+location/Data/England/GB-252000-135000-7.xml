		<title>07MARWOOD S. PROGRESSIVE FARM</title>
		<content>    Hewish farm is one of the largest  
 farms in the area. It has 334 acres   
 and Mr. Chugg has been farming here   
 since 1963 gradually adding to the    
 land.                                 
    He keeps about 260 sheep and this  
 year has 274 acres of corn. The size  
 of his fields vary from 4_37 acres.   
    Only one person works on the farm  
 all year but he has others in for     
 haymaking,combining,spraying and      
 hedging.                              
    Mr.Chugg has made several of his   
 fields larger by cutting down hedges  
 and replacing some with fences making 
 for more use of his land.             
    His farmland is very intensively   
 used in comparison with other parts of
 the block, especially the area around 
 Pippacott.
