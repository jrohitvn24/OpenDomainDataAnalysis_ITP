		<title>09 The Heritage Centre.</title>
		<content>The Heritage centre is in the middle of
Lichfield. It was originally the town  
church of St.Mary and there has been a 
church on this site for over seven     
hundred years. All the History of      
Lichfield is here in maps, models,     
displays, documents, embroideries and  
photographs and videos. St Mary's is   
still used as a church but many other  
things happen there. It is used as a   
place for elderly people to meet and   
and for visitors to see and read about 
Lichfield's History. There is a cafe   
and gift shop for visitors and also a  
day centre, where senior citizens can  
meet, to chat over refreshments in     
comfortable suroundings. They also hold
Whist Drives, Bridge School, Scrabble  
and other table games, Keep Fit and    
Beauty Classes and have lectures and   
discussions on various subjects.
