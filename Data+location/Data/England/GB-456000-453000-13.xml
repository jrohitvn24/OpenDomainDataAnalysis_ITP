		<title>13Cycling Proficiency</title>
		<content> We did our cycling proficiency        
 training in May and June 1985. On the 
 first day our cycles were checked for 
 safety by Mr Hogg the road safety     
 officer. We practised our riding      
 position and hand signals first and   
 with the help of mothers fathers and  
 teachers we learned other skills. We  
 learned how to set off properly, to   
 turn right at a stop sign to turn left
 at traffic lights and to slow down and
 stop. We  had to practise emergency   
 stops and to control our bicycles when
 moving slowly through cones. Those    
 people who didn't do very well had    
 extra practise. On Friday 14th June we
 had a practical test and a test       
 on the Highway Code. We all passed    
 with at least 90%. We had   metal     
 badges to wear and a sticker for our  
 bikes and three weeks later a         
 certificate of cycling proficiency.   </content>
