		<content>    The many jobs on the farms are     
 reasonably secure because this is an  
 arable area and this year it is the   
 dairy farms which have had to cut     
 their production.At Langford however  
 over the past three years,there have  
 been great changes.Some people in     
 Langford have spent all their lives   
 working for the Essex Water Works.The 
 most building to go on in the village 
 this century was for houses for water 
 workers.Now Langfords pumping is      
 being computerised.{30}men mostly     
 aged around 50 have lost their jobs in
 the last two years and more are due to
 lose them this next year.Langford also
 used to have 5 chemical laboratories  
 to test local water now these are     
 being cut to two.This is a great blow 
 to the village but the workers will   
 not have to lose their homes,they are 
 being given the chance to buy them.   </content>
