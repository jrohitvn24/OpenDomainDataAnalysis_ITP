 Winterborne Kington Football Club.    
 They play in the Dorset League and    
 they are in Division Four North. A few
 years ago they were in Division       
 Three. They play against other village
 team such as Sturminster Marshall and 
 Shillingstone. Kevin Pickering and    
 Steve Watts are in charge of the      
 training and Kevin Pickering is the   
 captain.They play their home games on 
 the recreation ground and they use the
 cricket pavilion for showers and      
 refreshments. Their colours are       
 gold and blue and Barbara Barnes      
 washes their kit every week. There are
 not many players at the moment who    
 live in the village, so they don't    
 have many spectators.
