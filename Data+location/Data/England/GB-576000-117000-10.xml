		<title>10Entertainment in Sedlescombe</title>
		<content> There is no commercially provided     
 entertainment in the Sedlescombe area 
 except television and radio. The      
 nearest theatres and cinemas are in   
 Hastings, Bexhill and Eastbourne.     
                                       
 The residents of the two villages are 
 able to receive the four main T.V.    
 channels. Besides the national radio  
 programmes the villages also receive  
 Radio Sussex with its articles of     
 local interest. The 'Village Diarist' 
 has a regular feature on this station.
                                       
 The community is very resourceful at  
 creating its own entertainment and    
 there are many clubs and societies,   
 some of which regularly put on shows  
 for anyone interested.
