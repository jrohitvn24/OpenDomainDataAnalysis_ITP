		<title>09HOUSES IN THE LONG LEE AREA</title>
		<content>   We went out into our area to find   
 out about the{local houses.}We wanted 
 to know about the{size of gardens,}the
{building materials}of the houses,the  
{age}of the houses and if they had     
{extensions}or not.                    
   We walked around the area and saw   
 that most people had extensions on    
 their houses. These were dormers and  
 garages with a bedroom above.  Most   
 people in our area have a large garden
 and not many people have small or open
 plan gardens.  Most of the houses are 
 about thirty or more years old,       
 although there is a new Barratt Estate
 in the middle of the older houses.    
 Most of the houses in our area are    
 semi_detached although there are a    
 few bungalows and cottages. There were
 more detached than terrace houses.    
 Most houses were pebble-dashed or     
 stone built.{                         </content>
