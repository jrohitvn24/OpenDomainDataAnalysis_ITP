		<title>17HOPES FOR THE FUTURE.</title>
		<content> Most hopes were directly connected    
 with the "CONCERNS" subjects. By far  
 the most were those of Peace,         
 Employment, Health and prosperity.    
 One person hoped that Manchester      
 United Football Club would win the    
 Football Association Cup - which they 
 promptly did!                         
 It is a time of recession and local   
 expansion seems unlikly in the        
 forseeable future, yet the micro-chip 
 seems poised to change many of the    
 established areas of life as we move  
 towards the 21st century.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
