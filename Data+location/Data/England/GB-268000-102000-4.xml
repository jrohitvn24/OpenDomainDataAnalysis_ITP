		<title>04Zeal Monachorum Village Hall</title>
		<content>Zeal Monachorum is fortunate to have a 
village hall; the local building which 
once housed the village school, and    
local groups take full advantage of it 
to hold their meetings and events.     
The village Women's Institute meet     
there every third Wednesday in the     
month. On every other Wednesday it is  
the 'club night' for the Adventure     
Club, the youth group for the village  
children, aged between eight and       
eighteen. Another group which meets    
regularly in the hall, is the Ladies   
Keep fit group.                        
The village hall is also the venue for 
the meetings of the Parish Council and,
on a less regular basis for other      
organisations such as Young Farmers.   
There is no doubt that the village hall
is truly essential to village life, and
the work of the Village Hall Committee 
is much appreciated.                   </content>
