    First of all you have someone{'on'.
 The person who is{'on'}runs after     
 other people and tries to touch them. 
 You are a{scarecrow}if you have been  
 touched and you stand with your legs  
 apart and arms out. {Scarecrows}are   
 freed by going under their legs.  If  
 someone has been a scarecrow three    
 times he/she is{'on'.}                
{SQUAD                                 
    Say a rhyme to decide who's'on'.The
 person{'on'}counts to 50, with eyes   
 closed,at a post.The others hide.When 
 the person{'on'}has finished counting 
 he has to find the others.When this   
 happens he has to run to the post and 
{shout'squad'}and the person's name.The
 people hiding have to try to run to   
 the post and shout{free-all.}If you   
 all get freed the same person is'on'- 
 if not the 1st person caught is'on'.  </content>
