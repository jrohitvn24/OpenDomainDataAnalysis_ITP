 WOODS AND ROUGH GRAZING LAND.IN THOSE 
 WOODS THERE ARE LARCH AND QUITE A LOT 
 OF PINE TREES.THERE ARE OPEN FIELDS   
 NEAR A VILLAGE CALLED BEELEY. NEAR    
 BEELEY THERE ARE ALOT OF FARMS AND    
 ANIMALS IN THE FIELD.WE GROW CROPS AT 
 FARMS TO EAT LIKE POTEOTOES AND       
 CARROTS.NEAR BEELEY RUNS THE RIVER    
 DERWENT IT ALMOST GOES STRAIGHT THOUGH
 OUR RECTANGLE.WHEN WE WENT ON OUR WALK
 WE STOPPED AT A PLACE CALLED          
 CHATSWORTH WHICH HAS SHEEP AND COWS ON
 THE LOOSE.WE HAVE ONLY GOT HALF       
 OF CHATSWORTH IN OUR AREA.THERE IS A  
 PLACE CALLED LEES MOOR WOOD WHICH IS  
 VERY BIG.
