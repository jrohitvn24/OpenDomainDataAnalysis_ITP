		<title>16Local Survey</title>
		<content> The survey of Willingham showed us    
 that it is a larger village than Upton
 and has a slightly higher unemployment
 figure.The main problem in the village
 is the road that passes through it.The
 road has two very nasty bends on it   
 which cause quite a lot of problems.  
 The figures that we used for the      
 village are the same type as the      
 ones we used for Upton{               
{Willingham} 1951 Population 404       
             1961 Population 408       
             1971 Population 418       
             1981 Population 498       
 In 1981 there were 236 males and 262  
 females living in the village.The     
 population breakdown is interesting.  
             Age 0-4:22 people         
             Age 5-14:82 people        
             Age 15-34:81 people
