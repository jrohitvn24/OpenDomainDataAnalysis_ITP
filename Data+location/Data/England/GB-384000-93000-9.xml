 the village.One is the Congregational 
 Chapel and the other is the Church    
 of England Church.There is a disused  
 Methodist chapel in the middle of the 
 village which is now used as a        
 builders store.In the school 14       
  children go to the Congregational    
 chapel,18 children go  to the         
 Church of England Church and 54       
 children attend neither. However 66   
 children were baptised into one or the
 other faith.Mr Burke comes up to the  
 school each week to talk to us.He is
