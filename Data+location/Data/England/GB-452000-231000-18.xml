		<content> The Village Club runs Senior and      
 Junior Football and Cricket teams,    
 playing fixtures in the area, and     
 there are also teams for the pub      
 sports. There are no children's       
 organisations, so parents have to take
 their children out of the village for 
 Brownies, ballet, Youth Clubs and so  
 on.  The youngsters tend to gravitate 
 to the Village Club.  There is no club
 for pensioners, and the WI is the only
 women's organisation.  It has around  
 30 members, and meets in its own hall,
 a former cricket pavilion donated by  
 the Bowlby Family of Croughton House  
 many years ago.  Keep Fit classes are 
 currently held in the WI Hall, and it 
 will be used for church services      
 during the restoration next year.
