		<title>08A Visit to the Wood Yard</title>
		<content>  On 21st June 1985, we went to the    
 wood yard. When we arrived, the       
{manager}showed us round. He said all  
 the workers had to wear ear muffs     
 otherwise they would become{deaf.     
  He showed us the wood they use to    
 make doors and we saw loads of        
 sawdust! We came to a door where he   
 said we could not go in as we were    
 under age and it would make us deaf.  
  He showed us an{extractor}on the roof
 and another on the ground, these take 
 away some of the dust.                
  They use{mahogany}and{English oak}and
 mainly make doors. A man brought out a
 box of bits of wood and we each took  
 some for ourselves and some for the   
 rest of the class.                    
  We said goodbye and thank you and    
 when we got back to school, we gave   
 everyone a piece of wood.
