		<title>04A Killamarsh Shop-Keeper</title>
		<content> We walked down to the Shopping Centre 
 in Killamarsh and talked to the       
 shop-keeper of a fruit and vegetable  
 shop. He came outside and sat with us 
 on a bench outside the shop. We asked 
 him how many customers he had each day
 and he told us that at the weekend he 
 has between two and three thousand but
 in the week only two or three hundred 
 a day. He starts work at 7.30 in the  
 morning when he goes to Parkway Market
 in Sheffield to buy his fruit and     
 vegetables. He opens his shop at 9    
 o'clock and closes it at 5.30.        
 Everyone who works in the shop gets   
 time off for dinner but the never     
 closes for dinner except on Wednesday 
 which is half day closing. He has four
 weeks holiday each year and when he   
 goes away a manager takes his place.  
 He has three other shops - in Worksop,
 Chesterfield and Sheffield.           </content>
