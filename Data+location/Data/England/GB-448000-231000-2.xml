		<title>02 PEOPLE IN AYNHO</title>
		<content>   We did a survey of people in Aynho. 
50% of houses replied.                 
   40% had {LIVED IN AYNHO} for more   
than 20 yrs;27% for 10-20yrs and 33%   
for less than 10 yrs.                  
   Of those who had {MOVED INTO AYNHO},
22% had lived in Northants;27% in Oxon,
13% in Bucks or Warks;22% in the South-
East;11% in the North and 5% elsewhere.
   The {AGE OF PEOPLE} who live in     
Aynho is old. 19% are under 18yrs;only 
10% are aged 19-30yrs;32% are aged 31- 
60yrs and 39% are over 60yrs.          
   All the people we asked liked living
in Aynho. It is a {POPULAR VILLAGE} and
so houses have become very expensive.  
Young couples cannot afford to buy a   
house here and so there aren't many    
children. This is why the school is    
having to close this year.             
                                       
                                       </content>
