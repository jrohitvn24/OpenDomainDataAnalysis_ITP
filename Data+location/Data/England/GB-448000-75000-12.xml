		<title>12Domestic Life in Niton 1985</title>
		<content> I housekeep for a family of six. I do 
 washing in a twin tub machine-some    
 people have automatic washing machines
 and tumble driers. I vacuum clean the 
 floors, then prepare a meal or bake   
 cakes.We have a solid fuel Aga,others 
 cook by electricity,or calor gas      
 (there is no mains gas in Niton) and  
 micro wave ovens are increasingly     
 popular.We have a refrigerator and    
 freezer and freeze some vegetables    
 from the garden.Sometimes I shop at   
 the local shops(2 grocery,1 Post      
 Office, 1butcher 1chemist) but it's   
 cheaper to go to a big supermarket    
 such as Tescos, near Ryde. There are  
 many ready prepared foods(tinned,     
 frozen or dried) available in the     
 shops. The milkman delivers every day 
 except Sunday. To buy clothes or      
 furniture we have to go to Newport, or
 buy through mail order catalogues.    </content>
