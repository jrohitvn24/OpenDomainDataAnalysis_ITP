		<title>07Health and Alms Houses.</title>
		<content> In 1872 in Godstone, St.Mary's homes, 
 known as the Alms Houses, were built. 
 Sir Gilbert Scott built the homes and 
 designed the homes in the fashion of  
 the 18th Century. There is a Chapel   
 there and the houses are used by old  
 folk.                                 
     Mrs.Hunt was the lady who wanted  
 the houses built in memory of her     
 daughter Mabel who had died with a    
 weak heart, after having attended a   
 ball. That was when the houses were   
 built in 1872.
