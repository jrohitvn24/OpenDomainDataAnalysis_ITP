 tennis club with two hard courts,which
 are used all year round.It has its own
 clubhouse.                            
 Next to the tennis club is a bowling  
 club situated in a very sheltered     
 hollow with a very pleasant pavilion.

 team who play on the main recreation  
 field close to the school.They have   
 recently acquired their own changing
