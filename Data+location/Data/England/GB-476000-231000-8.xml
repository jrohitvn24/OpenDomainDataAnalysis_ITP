		<content>{continued} People then just join in as
they come out from dinner. After play  
it is games. For games we have rounders
either in the hall, on the playground  
or on the field. We play rounders until
around 2.15 p.m. Once everybody has    
changed we usually watch a video until 
3.10 p.m. when the whistle goes for the
bus.                                   
 When I get home I have a drink and    
usually watch T.V. until my tea at     
about 5.45 p.m. After tea I have to    
feed our pets, Smokey the rabbit and   
Pepper the guinea pig.I lock them up   
for the night and either play cricket  
with the other boys in the village,    
play on the computer or watch T.V.     
Finally I go to bed and read after a   
long day.
