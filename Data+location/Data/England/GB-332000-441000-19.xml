     AT SCHOOL I RAN A CENSUS TO SEE   
WHICH COMIC THE CLASS LIKED BEST.THE   
{BEANO}WAS MOST POPULAR WITH OVER      
HALF VOTING FOR IT.THIS COMIC HAS      
BEEN AROUND SINCE 1938 AND I DON'T     
KNOW WHY IT IS STILL SO POPULAR.       
     A MUCH MORE MODERN COMIC IS THE   
ONE CALLED{2000 A.D.}FEATURING A       
LAWMAN CALLED {JUDGE DREDD}.THE COMIC  
HAS FIVE STORIES IN IT ALL OF WHICH ARE
ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE.            
     ANOTHER POPULAR COMIC IS THE ONE  
CALLED{EAGLE AND TIGER.}IT HAS NINE    
STORIES EACH WEEK AND MANY ARE SET IN  
THE FUTURE.                            
     THE EDITOR OF 2000 A.D. ID AN     
ALIEN CALLED THARG AND THE EDITOR OF   
THE EAGLE AND TIGER A COMPUTER CALLED  
MAX. I WONDER IF YOU WILL HAVE COMICS  
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE OR WILL YOU BE MORE  
INTERESTED IN THE PAST?BY{SHAUN R.}    </content>
