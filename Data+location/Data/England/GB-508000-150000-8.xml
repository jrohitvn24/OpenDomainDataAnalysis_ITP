		<content> St Mary's Anglican Church was founded 
 in 1030, some of the original building
 fabric still remaining.  It has been  
 added to over the centuries, including
 3 bells in the tower.  The church is  
 eligible for a percentage grant from  
 "English Heritage" for repairs, the   
 most urgent of these being the spire. 
 Commemorative thimbles are on sale as 
 souvenirs for fund raising &amp; parish-  
 ioners are organising an Auction for  
 this appeal.  Local drama society 'The
 Whips' presented T.S. Eliot's play    
 'Murder in the Cathedral' this year in
 the church.  New kneelers with designs
 featuring items from church history   
 are being embroidered by parishioners.
 The parish magazine is published each 
 month giving times of church services,
 details of parish activities, with ad-
 vertising by local businesses paying  
 for the cost of production.           </content>
