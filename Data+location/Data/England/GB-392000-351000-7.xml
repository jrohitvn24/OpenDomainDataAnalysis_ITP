		<content>    On the farm we visited there were  
210 acres of land but the farmer also  
worked a further 290 acres.He ploughs  
and reseeds the fields every six years,
doing about 20-30 acres at a time.He   
spreads manure in March,cuts the grass 
in June,spreads manure again and cuts  
again in August.Most is cut for silage 
making with a little for hay.Mr.Weaver 
uses manure mainly to fertilize but    
occasionally he uses nitrogen to       
promote grass growth.                  
    Four men are employed to service   
the tankers,tractors and other farm    
machinery.This machinery includes;six  
tractors,three silage trailers,a grass 
cutter and a chain harrow.This harrow  
hooks on to the back of a tractor and  
is used for levelling out the ground   
after ploughing and for breaking up the
manure after spreading.
