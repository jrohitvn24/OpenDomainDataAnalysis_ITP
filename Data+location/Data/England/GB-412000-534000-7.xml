		<title>07Life on High West Road.</title>
		<content> Life here is quite nice but all day   
 you can hear banging of the Open Cast 
 Mine in the area.                     
 There are very few facilities,no shops
 which means you have to travel down to
 Crook for most of the shopping.The    
 only facilities we have is a playing  
 field and some swings with a rocking  
 horse on the nearby Barrett housing   
 estate.                               
 At the top of the road there are few  
 farms one called Thistleflat Farm,one 
 called Woodifield Farm and some       
 others.                               
 Most of the land up West Road is farm 
 land.It was all fields until Banks    
 Contractors opened an open cast mine  
 to take the coal out of the ground.   
 In winter High West Road is usually   
 bad to travel along in a vehicle.
