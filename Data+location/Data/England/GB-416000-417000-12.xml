 teacher there is always hitting us    
 when we chatter {Christians}have their
{Bible}but our{Holy book}is called     
{Quaraan.}My life is hard because after
 school at five o'clock I have to go to
 the Mosque for an hour so I only get  
 an hour to play out.Now about the food
 I eat,well,I can eat what every       
 English person eats except the        
 meat.I'm not a vegetarian,I do eat    
 meat but only{Halaal}meat which is    
 specially slaughtered while the meat  
 that English people eat is{Haraam. My 
{Mosque life is very important to me   
{but I have an ordinary school life as 
{well.}I like coming to school and     
 doing the work at times.I work hard   
 because I would like to teach.I enjoy 
 swimming most of all.                 </content>
