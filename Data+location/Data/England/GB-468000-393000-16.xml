		<content> We went around Misson asking people   
 what sort of things they did in their 
 spare time.........                   
                                       
 People mostly gardened,knit,read or   
 went for walks.Often things which were
 mentioned were..........              
 Cooking,painting,cycling,shooting,    
 youth club work,driving,fishing,      
 looking after small children,taking   
 dogs for walks and sewing.Often people
 made comments like "what spare time?".
             {IN OUR CLASS             
  The children did different things in 
 there spare time.Some liked playing   
 football,snooker,squash,watching T.V,
