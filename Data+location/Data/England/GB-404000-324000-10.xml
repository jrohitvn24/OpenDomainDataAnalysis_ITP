		<title>10THE PUPPET THEATRE MUSEUM</title>
		<content> The museum is at Edinburgh House,     
 Bagot Street and is open most Sunday  
 afternoons. There at least two hundred
 puppets to see and lots more not on   
 show.                                 
 On Thursday we walked down to the     
 puppet museum and the owner talked to 
 us and told us about the puppets. We  
 had a look around the museum and      
 looked for the puppets mentioned on   
 the question sheet. The owner gave us 
 a little puppet show and the best     
 puppet was a man with long legs.
