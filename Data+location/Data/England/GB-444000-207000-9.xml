		<title>09Wytham: the Parish Registers</title>
		<content> We went to the Central Library in     
 Oxford to look for all sorts of       
 information on Wytham. Of course, the 
 book I used was a copy of the real    
 parish registers. They are in the     
 Bodleian library. I looked at the     
 facts for the last 10 years. There had
 been 8 deaths, 11 marriages, and 19   
 baptisms in that time. The oldest     
 person to be mentioned was a woman    
 called Dora Jarrett. She lived to be  
 95 - a good old age! Of the people who
 were married in Wytham Church, 6      
 couples lived in the village, and 5   
 marriages had been between people from
 elsewhere. Of the baptisms, or        
 christenings recorded, 8 had been of  
 local babies. Looking back, there had 
 been more deaths and marriages, but   
 fewer baptisms in a period of little  
 change. The coming of new families    
 might affect this.                    </content>
