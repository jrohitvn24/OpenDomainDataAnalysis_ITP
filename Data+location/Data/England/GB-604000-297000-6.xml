		<content> A local farmer descibed his farm as   
 follows:                              
 The farm comprises of 6 buildings     
 which are used for storing grain, hay,
 and housing cattle in winter. The     
 older buildings are clay lump, the    
 more recent ones brick or concrete.   
 The main crops grown are wheat,       
 barley, sugar beet, oats, hay and     
 peas. The farm practises a system of  
 rotation in order to maintain soil    
 fertility. Some natural and some      
 artificial fertilisers are used. Some 
 crops are used as fodder for cattle   
 and sheep, the rest is sent directly  
 to customers by the farm lorry. The   
 animals are sent to market in Norwich 
 and Bury St. Edmunds. The farm covers 
 590 acres and employs 5 local people.
