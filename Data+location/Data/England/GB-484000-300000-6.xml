 A conserved verge is situated between 
 Ayston and Ridlington and is called   
 81E the E being the eastern edge of   
 the road.It is rated by the           
 Leicestershire Museum Service at      
 'DISTRICT LEVEL'i.e not as important  
 as 'COUNTY LEVEL'but more important   
 than 'PARISH LELEL'. Sixty-five plant 
 species have been recorded from the   
 verge which lie on the sides of a     
 shallow valley, approximatley between 
 140m contours.A culvert carrying an   
 unnamed stream runs under the road at 
 the lowest point;this stream is the   
 parish boundry.The verge consists of a
 band of herbaceous plants near the    
 road side,with a shrub band on the    
 field side of the verge.The latter    
 contains field maple,hazel and guelder
 rose.Dog's Mercury also occurs on the 
 verge.                                </content>
