		<content>     The land is flat and fertile.There
 is farming, mostly cereal growing, in 
 hedged fields. Many hedges are very   
 old, mostly hawthorn,oak,maple and    
 bramble. There are many glasshouses   
 which are part of the smallholdings   
 where salad foods are grown.          
     Through the fields run many       
 ditches for drainage.There are also   
 four rifes (tidal inlets), Keynor     
 Rife, Mill Channel, Bremar Rife, and  
 Pagham Rife which run through the     
 fields.                               
     Most of Pagham Harbour is in our  
 rectangle.When the tide is out it is  
 a saltmarsh with mud flats and grassy 
 humps.Many wading and sea birds live  
 here and it has been made a nature    
 reserve.                              
      Many buildings are made from     
 field or beach flints, others from    
 Mixon stone found off Selsey Bill.    </content>
