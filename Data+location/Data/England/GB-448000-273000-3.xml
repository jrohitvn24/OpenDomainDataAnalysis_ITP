		<content>   THE ENVIRONMENT IN OUR AREA WAS ONCE
 QUITE PLEASANT WITH STREAMS AND       
 FIELDS.HOWEVER,NOW POLLUTION HAS TAKEN
 OVER.AT THE BOTTOM OF WESTFIELD ROAD, 
 NEAR TO 'TINTOWN',THERE IS A BROOK. AS
 YOU LOOK INTO THE BROOK YOU SEE THAT  
 IT HAS CANS,BOTTLES,PAPER AND OIL IN  
 IT.BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF 'TINTOWN' TOOK
 OVER,WILD FLOWERS WERE SEEN AROUND THE
 BROOK INSTEAD OF CRISP BAGS AND       
 RUBBISH.HOWEVER,DOWN BARBY ROAD,NEAR  
 TO THE HOSPITAL,THERE ARE A FEW       
 GRAZING FIELDS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN    
 MADE RESIDENTIAL.
