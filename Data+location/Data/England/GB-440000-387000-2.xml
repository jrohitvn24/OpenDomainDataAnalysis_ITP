		<title>02DAY IN LIFE OF PAUL LOFTUS</title>
		<content>    On{May Day 1985}I went to the{Dyke,
 with my mates. I had{a swim,}but Lee  
 and Craig didn't, because it was cold.
    After the swim we went back to the{
{Tarzan Swing}in the{wood,}which is a  
 rope on a tree.                       
    When we arrived, we started by     
 pushing each other, but then we spun  
 each other.                           
    After a while we set off home. On  
 the way we played a game in the{Rape  
{Field.}I hid and Lee ran at me, but as
 he was about to jump on me he fell and
 all we could hear was Lee saying,{"Ow 
{me 'and."                             
    Craig then laughed but Lee said,{  
{"Shurrup it isn't funny."}            
    We went up the slope until we      
 reached the top of the{"Hillies"}and  
 home.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
