		<content> Apart from the Army Camp (see Armed   
 Forces) the principal source of       
 employment for heads of households is 
 local farms.They are employed as      
 skilled specialist workers,such as    
 dairymen,tractor drivers and          
 shepherds.  Other members of          
 households travel outside the block to
 find employment. The main centres     
 being the towns of Bournemouth,Poole  
 and Dorchester, the Army Garrison at  
 Bovington and the Atomic Energy       
 Establishment on Winfrith Heath.      
 During the summer some seasonal       
 employment is available in the holiday
 trade centred on Lulworth Cove and    
 Durdle Door. The only exception to    
 this pattern is at Marley Wood Barn   
 where the owner/ occupier,Mr.Wintrip, 
 is a self-employed restorer of        
 antiques with a workshop attached to  
 his house.                            </content>
