		<title>12Blandford Fire Engine Rally</title>
		<content> On the 13th &amp; 14th July 1985 the 10th 
 Annual Engine Rally was in Blandford  
 in Crown Meadows.I went there on the  
 13th with my family &amp; our French      
 Student.It was 50p for children Â£1.50 
 for adults.When we got in we went on a
 train which went up &amp; down the rows of
 machines.Then we went on a fire engine
 up &amp; down the rows.It rings sometimes.
 My brother sat at the front.I sat by  
 the window.Before going home we went  
 on the bouncy castle.There were lots  
 of stalls but we did not go round     
 them.As you went out you got a stamp  
 on your hand so you could come in &amp; go
 out without paying again. In 1981 the 
 250th anniversary of the fire of      
 Blandford was commemorated by printing
 1000 First Day Covers-an idea of      
 Station Officer Ernie Adams.MBE who   
 also organises the Dorset Fire Engine 
 Rally.                                </content>
