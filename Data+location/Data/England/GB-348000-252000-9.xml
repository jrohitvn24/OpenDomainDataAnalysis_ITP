		<content> Since Mr Wickes has been headmaster at
 the village school, we have had a     
 School Summer Picnic. The{whole school
 goes for a{day trip}and provides their
 own{picnic lunch}which we have at a   
{beauty_spot.Any parent who wishes to  
{come may do so.}The school endeavours 
 to pay the cost of transport involved.
 This year,1985,26 children plus 16    
 adults in 8 vehicles went to the      
 Forest of Dean and visited{Puzzle Wood
 We had our{picnic}there. The weather  
 was sunny but a bit windy. A mile away
 is the{Clearwell Iron Mine.}We walked 
 down and round the mine. It was cold &amp;
 eerie.We went down Symonds Yat Rock to
 the{Jubilee Maze}at Symonds Yat.We all
 went round the maze.It took half an   
 hour.Then we played Tag in the Maze.It
 was good.There is a viewing platform  
 where our mums stood and shouted to us
 which way to go.{We had a lovely day..</content>
