		<title>13FARMING IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content> There are different farms in our      
{area,cattle,poultry,sheep,pigs        
{and arable}.My dad deals mostly  with 
{ sheep and}a few{cattle.}The{sheep    
  feed on{hay,corn,swede and kale etc,}
 as a substitute for grass.In summer   
 they are fed on grass.The{sheep}are   
 dipped annualy to protect them from   
 diseases and mites.They also must be  
 clipped in May and June so they are   
 not hot in summer.Most{lambs}are born 
 inside and kept in side.Another event 
 on the farm is {haymaking.}The{hay}   
 must be cut when it is ripe.First it  
 is cut down in rows.Then when it is   
 dry it is wuffled.Wuffled means that a
 machine turns it over so that the     
 other side can dry.When it is dry the 
 bailer picks up the{hay.}The hay is   
 then tied up with string into bails.  
 These come out,fall on the ground and 
 are stacked into piles on the trailer.</content>
