  In{1851}a hoard of{bronze coins}were 
 found in the village. They were of    
{roman origin}and were thought to have 
 been hidden about{AD 340.             
                                       
  In{1934}the few houses that there    
 were, were{scattered all over the     
{place,}with the church being the      
{furthest point away.                  
                                       
  Now, Easton, although still spread   
 out{has a central point.}At the       
 beginning of the war at least{100 new 
{houses}were built, and{since 1970}more
 have been built along{Marlingford Way 
 and{Woodview Close.}This also includes
 new amenities, a village hall, a      
 garage and a public house.
