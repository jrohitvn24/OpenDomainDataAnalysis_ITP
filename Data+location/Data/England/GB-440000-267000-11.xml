		<title>11Marton's Historic Bridge</title>
		<content> The road which runs through Marton is 
 known to have been carried over the   
 River Leam at this point as early as  
 the 13th.Century.Henry 111 committed  
 the Abbot of Sulby the charge of      
 receiving a toll for use of the       
 bridge.The present 15th Century bridge
 is built of sandstone.It was          
 constructed at the cost of one,John   
 Middleton,who having been born in     
 Marton and become a wealthy mercer in 
 London,decided that the locals should 
 no longer have to pay a toll.With the 
 completion of the new bridge no       
 payment was demanded of anyone.In 1924
 it was noted that the "modern traffic"
 had made the structure unsafe and a   
 decision was taken by the county      
 council to undertake repair work at a 
 cost of Â£3000.It now stands only 12'6"
 wide and carries heavy traffic batween
 Coventy and Banbury.                  </content>
