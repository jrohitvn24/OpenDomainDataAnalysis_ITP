		<title>15PUTTENHAM IN WORLD WAR II</title>
		<content> During the war two bombs fell just    
 outside the village and Lord Haw_Haw  
 annouced that the Hog's Back airfield 
 had been destroyed. There was no      
 airfield and the bombs did no         
 damage! But there was a platoon of    
 over 120 men in the Home Guard and    
 armed with guns and grenades they     
 manned an observation post on the     
 Hog's back. The area was important for
 agriculture and there was a machinery 
 pool in the village run by S.W.A.C.   
 Landgirls worked in the fields as did 
 Italian prisoners of war from a nearby
 camp. Children, some as young as five 
 years old, were evacuated from London 
 to Puttenham. There was very little   
 petrol for cars but plenty of buses,  
 at least ten a day through the        
 village.  At night the A.R.P wardens  
 made sure not a  chink of light was   
 showing.                              </content>
