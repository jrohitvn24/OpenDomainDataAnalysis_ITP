 When we got to the station it was     
 decorated like it was Christmas. There
 was a Christmas tree with tinsel &amp;    
 chocolate bunny rabbits &amp; pussy cats &amp;
 puppy dogs. It was just like          
 Christmas. Then we got on the train to
 go to Bridgnorth. On the train a man  
 came round with some chocolates and   
 wine gums. When we got to Bridgnorth  
 we went on a reindeer ride, it took us
 to Santa Claus. We had our photo taken
 with him and he gave us a mug with    
 "Severn Valley" on it. I thought it   
 was the best day of my life.
