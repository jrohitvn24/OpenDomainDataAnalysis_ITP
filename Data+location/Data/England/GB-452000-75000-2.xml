 Whitwell is a{rural village}set       
 amongst downs and farmland  two miles 
 north of Ventnor, and has a main      
 road,the High Street, running north   
 south, with estate developments on    
 either side behind it, and a junction 
 road leading to Niton, the next       
 village a mile or so away. At this    
 junction stands the parish church and 
 its churchyard, dating from the 12th  
 century, and in the High Street is    
 'The White Horse' public house built  
 in the 15th century. Further down the 
 High Street are old character         
 cottages, some of which are thatched, 
 interspersed with modern building.
