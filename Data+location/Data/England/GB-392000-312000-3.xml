 A church was built in 920 AD but it   
was not the church that we know today, 
that church was a little wooden hut    
next to the river Penk. The church we  
have today was built in the thirteenth 
century.                               
 There is a vicar and a choir master   
and organist.  There is a children's   
part of the church which is a Sunday   
school.  There are other clubs like    
the Mothers Union and Quest for young  
people.                                
 The services are 10.30 - 11.30 and    
6.30 - 7.30 on a Sunday and other      
services take place during the week.
