		<content> There are not many unusual or rare    
 plants in this area.{90%}of people    
 said that they had not seen any rare  
 or unusual plants but{1.1% }said they 
 had seen Mulberry,{1.1%}Teasle and    
{1.1%}Hymalayan Balsalm. The most      
 popular trees seen in this area are   
 Oak{22%}, Horse Chestnut with{19%}and 
 Sycamore{12%}. The others are Sweet   
 Chestnut, Beech, Ash, Birch, Pines,   
 Hawthorn, Fir Trees, Maple, Yew, Cedar
 and Elder. This shows that there are  
 quite a few trees in this area. In our
 school field there are a lot of       
 Sycamores and nettle bushes. At the   
 top end though there are some planted 
 trees which are not wild as they are  
 in the grounds of a large Victorian   
 house. A few streets in this area are 
 tree lined and a lot of old gardens   
 have probably got a tree in them      
 because we have a lot of old houses.  </content>
