		<content>   In the Newmarket Road area of the   
block there is a tennis club, golf     
course, bowling green and facilities   
for snooker and badminton. People also 
play football, cricket and rounders on 
the open spaces where there are        
slides and swings. A favourite game    
is to get four people to stand on      
the four swings while two people stand 
on the ground, one each side of the    
swings. They throw a ball at the       
swingers who may only hit back with    
head or feet. If a swinger is hit on   
the body or arms, he or she is "out".  
  Indoors, table-tennis and computer   
games are played. The popular games are
draughts, chess, Cluedo, Monopoly,     
Scrabble and Battleships.              
  From this district, people are only a
short walk from the Sports Centre and  
Rollerbury, the roller skating rink.
