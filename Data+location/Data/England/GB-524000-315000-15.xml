		<content>      The mobile library stops about   
 20 times a day and the library lends  
 about 3000 books a week. When they get
 back to the main library  the         
 requested books are found ready for   
 the next days round. They serve 60    
 villages and 3 schools which are all  
 too far from town to use the main     
 library.                              
      The most popular childrens books 
 are about the FAMOUS FIVE by ENID     
 BLYTON. The oldest book in the library
 is SENSE AND SENSABILITY and the most 
 recent is called HEAVEN AND EARTH. The
 most popular author on the van is     
 CATHERINE COOKSON.                    
      The mobile library visits our    
 village on alternate Mondays.
