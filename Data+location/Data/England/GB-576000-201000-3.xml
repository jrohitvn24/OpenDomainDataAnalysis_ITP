		<content> THE FORD                              
 The ford is about 3 kilometres from   
 the Cricketers Public House on{Danbury
{Common.}There is marshland, a         
 waterlogged area, surrounding the     
 ford.  The level of water in a marsh  
 is seasonal.  Flooding is caused in   
 winter, and this affects the nature of
 the vegetation.  In the marshland the 
 soil is composed of inorganic         
 material, often at the edge of a pond 
 or lake.  On the ponds in the marshy  
 areas duckweed and reedmaces, or      
 bulrushes, are to be found.  Either   
 side of the road at the ford the river
 is quite deep, but it is shallow on   
 the road, except after heavy rainfall.
  There is a little wooden bridge to   
 the left of the ford, for pedestrians.
  The river, thought to be Sandon      
 Brook, runs into more marshland owned 
    by the{National Trust.}            </content>
