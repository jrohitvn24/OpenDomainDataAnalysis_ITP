		<title>09Witherley Church Restoration</title>
		<content> After standing for 500 years, St      
 Peter's Church in Witherley is in need
 of extensive restoration.             
                                       
 The masonry of the south wall of the  
 church needs cutting back to where it 
 is not crumbling.                     
                                       
 The stained glass needs renewing. It  
 has been there from when the church   
 was first built. The glass will be    
 taken down and taken to London, where 
 it will be renewed by expert          
 repairers.                            
                                       
 The repairs are going to cost Â£48,000.
 The parish will receive a grant of 40%
 of this from the government. Â£20,000  
 has been raised so far, including a   
 donation from Queen Elizabeth the     
 Queen Mother.                         
                                       </content>
