		<title>04Farming - Crops</title>
		<content> This is an agricultural area covered  
 with intensive grassland which is made
 into silage and hay. Cereals such as  
 corn and oats are the second heaviest 
 crop and like the grassland provide   
 winter feed for the animals. Catch    
 crops such as kale, swedes and        
 turnips are also grown for animal     
 feeds. Apples are grown for cider     
 making. These apples are too          
 unpleasant to eat, being rather       
 bitter. They are harvested by         
 spreading large nets underneath the   
 trees and literally shaken down;      
 bruising of the fruit is unimportant  
 as they are going to be crushed       
 anyhow. Coxland Farm have their own   
 press and they are well known in the  
 area for the quality of their cider.  
 There is also a large apple orchard at
 Horselake with Cox's Orange Pippins   
 and Bramleys.  By Mrs N Butterworth   </content>
