		<title>18TREMATON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  {Trematon village}is approx two and a
 half km from{Trematon Castle} and is  
 situated in an isolated area.         
   Trematon has few amenities. Farming 
 is the only industry. The only{public 
{transport}is the bus and according to 
 the local residents the service is    
 very poor.Because of this most people 
 travel by car. Many roads are no more 
 than rough tracks. One of the main    
 disadvantages of living here is the   
 absence of a post office, the         
 dependence on relatively expensive    
{mobile shops.}This causes difficulties
 for the disabled and elderly.         
 There is an active{Women's Institute  
 which meets in Trematon Hall,a private
 home,as there is no public meeting    
 place in the village.{The Methodist   
{Church}was closed recently as the     
 congregation had dwindled to two or   
 three adults.                         </content>
