		<title>18Shopping on Shoreham Beach</title>
		<content> adequate.3 people said that the shops 
 were not satifactory.                 
    When we asked them where they      
 shopped for larger items they said    
 that they went to Brighton or Worthing
    The prices in the shops are fairly 
 cheap and because they are close at   
 hand the older generation can reach   
 them easily.                          
    From a shop count in the High      
 Street one can see that most of the   
 shops fall into 2 of the 3 categories,
 convenience and specialist shops.As a 
 result Shoreham does not provide its  
 inhabitants with a lot of choice.     
    The peoples attitudes towards the  
 shops is that Shoreham only provides  
 them with basic needs.This causes them
 to shop in larger towns like Brighton.
