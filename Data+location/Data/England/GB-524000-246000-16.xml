		<content>     Wrestlingworth is an active       
 village. There are always social      
 events being held here. Village Day   
 is a big event held in July, when     
 country crafts and Morris Dancers can 
 be seen. A recent group was formed to 
 raise money to provide swings and     
 other apparatus for the local children
 to play on in the village playing     
 field. "Swings" invited local M.P.    
 Nicholas Lyall to their opening       
 ceremony in May 1985. Other events    
 throughout the year include Sports    
 Days, Bistros, Dances, Whist Drives,  
 Barbecues with something happening    
 most weekends.
