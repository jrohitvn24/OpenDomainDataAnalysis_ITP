		<title>04Wimbledon Park</title>
		<content>In the 18th century this was the park  
of a great mansion.Now it is a popular 
place with local people for walking or 
for sport and is very busy at weekends.
The lake,about 0.5 Km long, is used by 
children learning to sail small boats. 
There are swings, a mini golf course,an
open area for football, a bowling green
with clubhouse and twenty tennis courts
There is a Stadium which until recently
had a running track used by local clubs
for training and for cross country     
races but the council could not afford 
its upkeep.In July 1985 the DOE is to  
hold a Public Enquiry about the Stadium
the Corinthian Casuals,a famous amateur
football team who have no home ground, 
want to lease the Stadium.Local people 
object because they are afraid this    
will mean floodlights and a new road   
and much more traffic nearby.
