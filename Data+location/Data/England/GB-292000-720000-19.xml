		<content> People were sorry that the only       
 shop and Post Office in St. David's   
 closed.                               
 The high cost of petrol bothers people
 here as we have to travel 7 miles to  
 the nearest shops.                    
 Parents are worried about bills,      
 electricity bills,telephone bills,TV  
 licences.                             
 The houses here were re-valued for    
 Rates and most people feel they are   
 too high.                             
 Farmers are worried about the weather,
 as usual.They want rain just now and  
 then sun to ripen the crops.          
 Many rural schools in this area have  
 closed down and everyone is very sad  
 about this.                           
 Everyone has been upset about the     
 famine in Ethiopia and have raised    
 money to help.                        
                                       </content>
