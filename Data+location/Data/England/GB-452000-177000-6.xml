    The oldest part of the church is   
 the lower half of the tower,dating    
 from the 12th century.The nine        
 effigies, probably  made of Caen      
 stone, were carved between            
 approximately 1300 and 1350.Their age 
 makes them of great intrest aswell as 
 the fact that they contain so many of 
 the De La Beche family in one parish  
 church. Even in their damaged state   
 they are quite remarkable.Legend says 
 there used to be a passage from       
 the De La Beche manor house to the    
 church.In the churchyard there is a   
 Yew tree that is estimated to be over 
 1000.It was struck by lightning on    
 January 2nd 1976.In the church there  
 are some candlesticks made from the   
 tree.
