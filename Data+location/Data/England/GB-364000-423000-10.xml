		<title>10FORMS OF TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>      We wanted to find out how many   
 forms of transport each family owned. 
 In our survey we asked 24 children.   
      Of the 24 families only one did  
 not have a car, 18 families had one   
 car, 4 had two and 1 family had three 
 cars.                                 
      Perhaps the most surprising fact 
 we discovered was that related to     
 bicycles. Every family had at least   
 one bike, 7 families had two, 7 had   
 three, 6 had four bikes and 3 families
 had five. We found that the number of 
 bicycles each family had was relative 
 to the number of children in that     
 family.                               
      Another discovery was that 10    
 families in our survey owned a boat,  
 we did not expect this to be so high, 
 perhaps it is because we live near to 
 a canal. Motorbike and scooter owners 
 were lower than we had expected.      </content>
