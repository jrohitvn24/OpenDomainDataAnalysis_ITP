		<title>16THE HAYCOCK HOTEL, WANSFORD</title>
		<content>  The date of the original inn on this 
 site is uncertain but a date stone    
 found in the garden places the present
 building at 1632. It has changed hands
 many times, reputedly once over a game
 of cards, and it has been used as a   
 racing stable, a farm, a hunting lodge
 and even during the first world war as
 an ammunition factory.                
  During its time as an inn many famous
 people have stayed at the Haycock en  
 route north or south along the former 
 Great North Road (now the A1). These  
 people include Queen Victoria and Mary
 Queen of Scots.                       
  The Haycock is built of local        
 freestone of the type that has been   
 used to repair the Houses of          
 Parliament, and there is over an acre 
 of local Collyweston slate on the     
 roof. Today it is a very popular inn  
 used by locals and travellers alike.  </content>
