		<content> At West Hill, a block of unfurnished  
 independent flatlets-four of them     
 double ones-caters for elderly people 
 who are well enough to look after     
 themselves.                           
 There is a communal lounge, laundry   
 facilities, coin box telephone and a  
 guest room with sleeping accommodation
 to enable relatives and close friends 
 to visit for short periods.           
 The flatlets and some nearby bungalows
 are all linked to an alarm system     
 which alerts the Warden in case of    
 emergency.                            
 The Warden is employed by Carlisle    
 City Council. She is on duty from 7pm 
 to 12 noon the following day. A relief
 Warden takes over two days a week. The
 Warden visits each tenant once a day  
 and will summon any service that may  
 be needed in an emergency.
