		<title>03INDUSTRY IN HOLMES CHAPEL</title>
		<content> Several important industrial          
 enterprises are based in Holmes       
 Chapel.                               
 The Victoria Mills opened as a        
 wallpaper factory in 1911 and although
 there has been a reducation in output,
 wallpaper is still being made by FADS.
 Bengers opened a factory in 1937 which
 is now Fisons Pharmaceuticals.        
 Research carried out in Holmes Chapel 
 has led to the development of a drug  
 to relieve breathing problems - sodium
 cromoglycate, marketed throughout the 
 world as INTAL.  The product was      
 introduced in 1968 and its proven     
 value has necessitated an expansion of
 production facilities to support the  
 worldwide demand for the product.  A  
 mixture of light industry is situated 
 along Manor Lane, including           
 educational equipment, sportswear,    
 computer equipment, packing, etc.     </content>
