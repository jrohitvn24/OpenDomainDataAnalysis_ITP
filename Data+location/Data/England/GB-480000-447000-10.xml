		<content>{Q. Recently many shops in the town    
{have changed ownership or closed. What
{do you think are the main reasons? }  
 A. This is related to the change in   
 our shopping practices. We're now     
 accustomed to self-service stores and 
 supermarkets, whereas 30 years ago a  
 grocer would call upon you, take your 
 order and deliver your goods. There   
 used to be 10 or 12 shops and now we  
 only have 2, both supermarkets.       
{Q. Are there any special annual events
{in Pocklington?}                      
 A. There's the Pocklington Rugby 7's  
 on Good Friday; at Christmas we have  
 celebrations round the Christmas Tree 
 in the Market Place; and the annual   
 carnival market is a great success    
 attracting many people to Pocklington 
 in August. Next year we hope to revive
 an annual arts festival which we held 
 successfully for a number of years.   </content>
