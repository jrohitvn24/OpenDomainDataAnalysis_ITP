		<content>         A Typical Sunday              
      The Harrop household starts      
 Sunday with a fight for the bathroom. 
 Today it is Church Parade at Christ   
 Church so the children wear their     
 Guide, Brownie or Cub uniform. Bob is 
 a Sidesman so he must be early to ring
 the Church bell. During the service   
 Andrea and her friend Samantha carry  
 the Guide pennant to the altar.       
      My friend Brenda and I are       
 on the coffee rota today so we must   
 organise this. Ian and Emma collect   
 the dirty cups for washing up.        
      Hopefully, lunch might be early  
 as we are all going for a walk to     
 Stokes Bay and the grassy slopes of   
 Fort Gilkicker. When we arrive home   
 the children will have developed good 
 appetites. After tea we will potter in
 the garden or watch television until  
 it is time for baths and bed.         </content>
