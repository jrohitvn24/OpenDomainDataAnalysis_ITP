		<title>17Egg Production in  Fenton</title>
		<content> There is a small poultry farm run as a
 family business employing three of the
 family, three full-time male and eight
 part-time female workers. Eggs are    
 produced from a flock of 60,000 hens  
 by factory farming methods. 10,000    
 birds are housed in cages in six sheds
 and are automatically fed, watered and
 cleaned. Point of lay pullets are     
 bought in at 12 weeks, start laying at
 16 weeks and work to a peak of 10,000 
 eggs per day. The hens are kept for   
 approximately 18 months, then sold for
 human consumption or pet food. Some   
 eggs are graded and sold locally; the 
 majority are sent to an Egg Packing   
 Station to be graded and packed for   
 sale to supermarkets and shops.       
 A smaller farm is run on similar lines
 by another family. Some of their eggs 
 are sent to the Packing Station but   
 most are sold, ungraded, at the door. </content>
