		<title>12BRIERLEY HILL, CHANGES</title>
		<content>    At one end of the{High Street      
 stands the{Brierley Hill Civic Hall   
 and this popular place of             
 entertainment has a repertoire ranging
 from wrestling to classical music     
 concerts. The area it serves has      
 altered over the last ten years as    
 many large new housing developments   
 have sprung up in the district.       
    Despite the changes,{Brierley Hill 
{High Street}is still a popular        
 shopping area and retains some of the 
 traditional High Street atmosphere. It
 is however, set for further, more     
 drastic changes soon, as a new vast   
 development containing a shopping     
 precinct, leisure centre and office   
 space nears completion. Judging by the
 local press, this new development     
 although welcomed by some, is seen by 
 others as another nail in the coffin  
 of{Brierley Hill High Street.         </content>
