		<content>     Most of the  Juniors  go  swimming
 every Tuesday at Belper Sports Centre.
 The Infants  go swimming at Wirksworth
 on Tuesdays. I like playing  games  on
 the computer best.In July ,we have our
 SPORTS  DAY.  We  have  these  races:-
{sprint, egg + spoon, potato, skipping,
{sack,  obstacle , marathon  and relay.
     My  favourite  dinner is  sausages
 for the first course and iced buns for
 the second course.                    
     I like this school because  it  is
 small.I like the teachers.Julie Little
 is my best friend. On our school field
 we  have  a big hollow log that we can
 play on. We also have two  small  logs
 that we can play on.                  
     On Wednesdays, some of the old age
 pensioners come  to  school  and  have
 dinner with us. Some  of them  came to
 this school when theu were small. They
 think it is much better at school now!</content>
