		<content> They go to market when they are about 
 one year old .                        
 We keep our own Charalais and         
 Hereford bulls for breeding.          
 In the milking  parlour a computer is 
 used to record each cows production of
 milk.                                 
 The milk goes into a large            
 refrigerated tank and then it is      
 collected by a tanker and taken to    
 the milk  marketing board dairy.      
 We have a flock of 90 ewes and two    
 rams and 125 lambs .                  
 These are also sold at market for     
 meat.                                 
 All the meadow grass is made  into    
 silage for winter fodder. Any straw or
 hay we need we now buy at Chelford or 
 Bakewell market.                      
 Because I live on a farm I am able to 
 keep lots of pets.
