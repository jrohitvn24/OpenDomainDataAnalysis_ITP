		<title>04Upper Plumstead: 05430177</title>
		<content> This is part of the north slope of    
 Shooters Hill with large public open  
 spaces at the top and bottom. The area
 around Plumstead Common has Victorian 
 and Edwardian houses and artisan's    
 terraces reaching up the hill towards 
 1930s private semi-detached houses,   
 built on the sites of large houses    
 towards the top of the hill. In       
 Genesta Road there are 4 houses       
 designed by the architect Lubetkin.   
 There is very little council housing, 
 or post-war building.                 
 The residents are a mixture of        
 professional and working-classes      
 including a proportion of Indian      
 immigrants.                           
 A major local concern is the proposed 
 East London river crossing, a bridge  
 over the Thames plus a motorway type  
 road near the area.
