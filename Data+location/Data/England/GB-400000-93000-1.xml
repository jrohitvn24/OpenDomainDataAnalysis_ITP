		<content>   I'm Claire.I get up at 7.20.        
   My dad gets up at 7.00.             
   My mum gets up at 7.15.             
   My sister,Michelle,gets up at 7.30. 
       We all get dressed and have a   
 wash. Then my mum has to shout at     
 Michelle all the time and tell her    
 what to do.My sister is very slow.My  
 mum and dad go downstairs for some    
 breakfast. My sister and I don't have 
 any breakfast.When we are ready, we go
 downstairs and do the washing and     
 wiping up.By the time we have done the
 washing up our friends have come      
 round.I leave home at 8.00 but my     
 tortoise sister leaves home at 8.30.I 
 arrive at school at about 20 past 8.  
       Then we start the school day,   
 but that's another story!
