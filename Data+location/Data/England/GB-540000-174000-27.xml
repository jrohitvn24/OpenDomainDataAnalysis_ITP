Today is Saturday. I got out of my bed and went down stairs for breakfast. I had a chocolate sandwich for breakfast and some hot milk mmm it was lovely.&lt;br />&lt;br />After I went upstairs got change in a track suit because I was getting ready to go Ice –Skating with my friend Zoe. (People think we are twins.)                                                 &lt;br />&lt;br />When we arrived at ice skating we put our own boots on and started practising for the big day. (Show.)&lt;br />&lt;br /> In our show we are dancing to ‘California Girls’ by Katy Perry. We had to do it 10 times.  When we finished we played a game called the Octopus.&lt;br />&lt;br /> Zoe wanted a Doo Doo bird so I got it for her.&lt;br />&lt;br />We got some sweets called Strawberry Laces mmm  it was yummy.&lt;br />&lt;br /> Soon we had to go home we dropped off  Zoe and then went  back home. Now  for a relaxing time.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
