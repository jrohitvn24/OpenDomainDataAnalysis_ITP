		<title>17WHADDON CHURCH FETE</title>
		<content> Every year in June or July Whaddon    
 Church holds a fete. This is held in  
 Whaddon House. We asked Mrs Weatherby 
 about it. She says that it has been   
 held at Whaddon House for 15 years.   
 The owners welcome all the villagers  
 on this day as there is no rectory in 
 Whaddon now. The Rector lives at the  
 rectory in Newton Longville. We were  
 quite amazed to hear that during those
 15 years there had only been one year 
 when the fete was held on a wet day.  
 Whaddon First school children usually 
 take part in the church fete. This    
 year the older children at the school 
 did some country dancing. We all look 
 forward to this special day when we   
 can spend some time in the beautiful  
 garden of Whaddon House.
