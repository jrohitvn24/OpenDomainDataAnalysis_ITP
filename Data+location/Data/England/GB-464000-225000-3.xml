		<content> As in most areas the local dialect is 
 disappearing as people move about from
 one area to another,watch television  
 and listen to radio.The older         
 generation of the local farming       
 community still speak the local       
 dialect but the true broad form was   
 last commonly used by the parents of  
 people now in their sixties and       
 seventies.                            
 Some local words spoken in dialect    
 are:  wur = was                       
        of = off                       
     parst = past                      
      fust = first                     
     allus = always                    
       are = our                       
 "where be ye goin?" = "where are you  
 going?"                               
 English is the native tongue of 99% of
 the people in our block.
