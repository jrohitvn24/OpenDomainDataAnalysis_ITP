		<title>03THE CASTLE, LINCOLN.</title>
		<content> The{Castle}was started in{1068}shortly
 after the {Norman Conquest,}to control
 the city for the  invaders. The Castle
 has impressive walls, towers and gate-
 houses  that  now  enclose  the{County
{Assize Court.                         
 After  the  violence  of  the medieval
 period  and Civil  War, the Castle was
 used as a{prison}and the buildings and
 courthouses  remain.{Cobb  Hall,}a    
 medieval tower  was  used for dungeons
 whilst  public  hangings took place on
 its roof. Those  hanged were buried in
 the  old keep,{Lucy Tower.}The {prison
{chapel }is  a  unique  survival of the
 Victorian prison system. Each prisoner
 was locked into a separate compartment
 from  where  he could see the Chaplain
 but no-one else.                      
 Popular attractions  include the{Civil
{War  siege }and  a {Medieval Joust}and
{Fayre}which attract many tourists.    </content>
