		<title>02The village of Bredfield</title>
		<content>     Bredfield is a small village where
there is a church which has Sunday     
school every week and family services. 
Once a year there is a fete at the Old 
Rectory to raise money for the church. 
     Near the church is the shop, which
is also the post office. It is a       
general shop which sells everyday      
things which people might need like    
groceries, stationery, first aid       
equipment and newspapers. Outside the  
shop there is a public telephone box.  
In the shop window posters are put up  
to tell people what is going on and    
where.                                 
     There is a pub called "The        
Castle" in the centre of the village.  
It gets its name from the old manor    
which was thought to be a castle       
because it was on a mound with a moat  
round it. The pub sells meals at       
lunchtime and in the evenings.         </content>
