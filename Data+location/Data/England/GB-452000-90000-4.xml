		<title>04WOOTTON'S VILLAGE POLICEMAN</title>
		<content>                                       
   Wootton's community policeman rides 
 his motorbicycle around his area for 8
 hours a day. He is the only policeman 
 in Wootton and when he is off duty    
 Wootton is patrolled by Ryde police   
 force. He works mainly in the village 
 but sometimes has to attend football  
 matches on the mainland.              
  Most of the time he is concerned with
 routine chores such as checking the   
 firearms of local farmers and making  
 sure there is no trouble at pubs.     
 Sometimes he has to investigate the   
 thefts of boats and equipment.        
 Burglary from boats is the main       
 problem in Wootton because often it is
 not discovered until the owner wants  
 to use the boat again. He has little  
 trouble from tourists apart from the  
 occasional gangs of youths causing    
 trouble.                              </content>
