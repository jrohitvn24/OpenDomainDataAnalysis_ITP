		<content>  Since 1972 there has been a steady   
 development of twinning activities    
 between Honiton and Mezidon-Canon in  
 France. In June 1973 the charter was  
 signed pledging cultural, sporting and
 touristic links between the two towns.
  Many families have made exchange     
 visits. The Community College and     
 Honiton Primary School send pupils    
 regularly to France. Since 1979       
 Honiton children have exchanged with  
 Gronau (Leine) in West Germany which  
 is Mezidon's twin town. When they     
 visit they meet pupils from there and 
 also from Fijnaart in the Netherlands.
  Twinning activities are promoted by a
 committee set up by Honiton Town      
 Council. This year the Mayor has      
 visited Gronau and invited his German 
 counterpart to return in the hope that
 it will lead to more formal links.
