		<title>14Redlynch Birds Observed</title>
		<content> A record is kept of birds seen around 
 the school and food is put out during 
 the winter.                           
   Winter visitors include redwing,    
 fieldfare and siskin. Nesting species 
 include blackbird, starling, house    
 sparrow and house martin. Mistle      
 thrush and spotted flycatchers nest in
 the churchyard and blue tits use boxes
 put up by the children.               
   In addition to rook, jackdaw,       
 collared dove, wood pigeon, pheasant, 
 magpie, wren, greenfinch, chaffinch,  
 robin, dunnock, pied wagtail, great   
 tit and swift, the school has been    
 visited by cuckoo, heron, kestrel,    
 buzzard and Canada goose.             
   A sparrow hawk which attacked birds 
 feeding on the table, caused a blue   
 tit to enter the class room where it  
 died, presumably of shock.
