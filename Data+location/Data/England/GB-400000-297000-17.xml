		<title>17LIMESTONE IN WALSALL</title>
		<content> In the 18th century Walsall had six   
 blast furnaces. These furnaces were   
 used for smelting iron.{Limestone}was 
 used in these furnaces, one of these  
 furnaces was at Ladypool, Rushall. In 
 1978 some of the mines started to     
 collapse and houses became affected.  
 The Government brought in some        
 consultant engineers to{investigate   
{the extent of damage}and the risk of  
 ground movements. No records or maps  
 were kept so it was almost impossible 
 to find the{Limestone mines.}To find  
 the mines the engineers drilled holes 
 in the ground. Not all of the mines   
 have been discovered. The engineers   
 can not forecast whether there will be
 any more disturbances. There is a very
 low risk of damage to houses. Now     
 people find it{very hard to sell      
{houses}because of limestone.
