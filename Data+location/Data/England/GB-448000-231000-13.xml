		<title>13 AYNHO: AGRICULTURE</title>
		<content>   Nearly all of the land in Aynho is  
farmed. There are hay meadows down in  
the valley, and cereal and grazing on  
the higher land. Much of the old deer  
park is now farmed though about a third
is still managed woodland.             
                                       
   There are 3 farms in this area of   
Aynho.                                 
    {COLLEGE FARM} grows cereals and   
keeps horses.                          
    {NELL BRIDGE FARM} grow cereals    
and also they keep lots of sheep.      
{LOWER AYNHO GROUNDS FARM} keeps       
South Devon and Charolais cattle for   
beef. They also keep sheep. They grow  
cereals and grass. There is also a     
plum orchard on this farm. They grow 3 
varieties:Marjory, Czar and  Victoria. 
In the autumn lots of villagers come   
and pick the plums which are sold.
