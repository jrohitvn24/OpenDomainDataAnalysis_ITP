		<title>14THE 2ND SANDY BROWNIE PACK</title>
		<content>  I GO TO A BROWNIE PACK AT ROBERT PEEL
 SCHOOL ON WEDNESDAYS. IT IS THE 2ND   
 SANDY BROWNIE PACK. WE DO INTERESTING 
 THINGS LIKE MAKING THINGS, HAVING     
 FILMS AND VISITING PLACES. WE ALSO    
 WORK FOR OUR BADGES.                  
  WHEN YOU GET ENROLLED YOU HAVE TO    
 MAKE THE BROWNIE PROMISE. IT SAYS, "I 
 PROMISE THAT I WILL DO MY BEST TO DO  
 MY DUTY TO GOD, TO SERVE THE QUEEN AND
 HELP OTHERS, AND TO KEEP THE BROWNIE  
 PACK PROMISE."                        
  THE BROWNIE MOTTO IS "A BROWNIE GUIDE
 THINKS OF OTHERS BEFORE HERSELF AND   
 DOES A GOOD TURN EVERYDAY."           
  I STARTED BROWNIES WHEN I WAS EIGHT  
 AND WHEN I AM TEN I WILL GO UP TO     
 GUIDES. THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER       
 BROWNIE PACKS IN SANDY. WE GO TO      
 BROWNIES TO MAKE FRIENDS. THE BROWNIE 
 CANDLE IS A SIGN OF FRIENDSHIP.
