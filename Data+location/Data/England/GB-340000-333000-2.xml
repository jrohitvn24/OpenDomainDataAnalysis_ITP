 by Mr. Watson and a carpenters.Most of
 the men worked on the land or the     
 railway and canal.                    
 The road surfaces were rough then with
 just stones and broken cobbles hand   
 picked out of fields.The only traffic 
 was horsedrawn.                       
 Many of the outbuildings adjoining the
 Sun public house have been demolished.
 Ladies in those days wore long skirts 
 and blouses,boots and always a hat.The
 men wore corduroy trousers,cloth      
 jackets and heavy boots with plates   
 and studs.The families then were much 
 larger.Entertainment was of the       
 homespun variety.  Following an
