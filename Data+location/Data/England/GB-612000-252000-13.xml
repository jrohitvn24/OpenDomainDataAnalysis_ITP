		<title>13Coddenham Area Schooling</title>
		<content> The village school in Coddenham closed
 15 years ago. It dated back to the    
 18th Century when it was charitably   
 endowed "for teaching 15 poor boys of 
 Coddenham to read, write and cast     
 accounts and the girls knitting and   
 sewing also". today transport is      
 provided to take 5-11yr olds to a CofE
 school in Stonham Aspal 4 miles away. 
 There is a Playgroup at the School and
 Mother and Toddler Group in Crowfield 
 village 2\ miles away. Hemingstone    
 school is also closed and 5-11yr olds 
 are transported to a school in Henley 
 nearby where there is also a          
 Playgroup. At 11yrs most children in  
 our block travel by the school bus to 
 Claydon High School 3 miles away. The 
 Suffolk College of Higher and Further 
 Education in Ipswich can be the next  
 step. Private education is available  
 in Ipswich and Stowmarket.            </content>
