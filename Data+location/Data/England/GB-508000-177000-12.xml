 These are the results of a traffic    
 survey carried out on Western Road,   
 Southall, during Tuesday afternoon,   
 July 16 at about 3pm.                 
                                       
 Cars 131                              
 Lorries 40                            
 Buses 2                               
 People 43                             
 Bikes and motorbikes 3                
                                       
 As the survey was only carried out for
 a very short time, about ten minutes, 
 it shows how busy the area is.  In    
 particular there was a very high      
 number of cars considering that this  
 was at one of the least busy times of 
 day.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
