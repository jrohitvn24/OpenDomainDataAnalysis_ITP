		<title>07TUNSTEAD C.E. SCHOOL</title>
		<content> This school was built in 1881 and it  
 has 7 classes. There are 10 teachers  
 in our school but two of them only    
 work part time. We are having a new   
 school built which is nearly finished.
 It will be an open plan community     
 school, but it will still be a Church 
 of England School.  This school is 104
 years old, and we have discos, summer 
 fairs and toy and book sales. My      
 teacher is called Mr. Dean and my     
 brother's is Miss Parnell.  Our class 
 is writing about the Normans.  We have
 a football yard and the girls play    
 rounders in the bottom yard, but our  
 new school will have playing fields   
 and it will also have a nursery. The  
 Headteacher is called Mr. Martin and  
 the vicar is called Mr. Ashworth.
