		<content> The area of Stainton Parish is 2,413  
 acres. Of this approximately 8% is    
 used for industrial purposes with the 
 rest utilised for agricultural and    
 residential purposes. Development has 
 spread along a gorge like valley. A   
 farming community in the past,        
 Stainton is now becoming a dormitory  
 village for Doncaster, Rotherham and  
 Sheffield. A mains water supply was   
 laid in the village in 1938 and the   
 installation of electricity to houses 
 in 1951.Only houses built after 1969  
 are connected to a sewerage system.   
 Since 1983 an average of 16 children  
 are transported daily to the          
 neighbouring school at Braithwell. 206
 people live in the village. There are 
 8 farms, both arable and dairy.The    
 houses are either stone buildings or  
 modern bungalows made of bricks from  
 the local quarry.                     </content>
