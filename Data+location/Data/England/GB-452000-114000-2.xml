		<title>02LAND USE PATTERNS</title>
		<content> The reason for the land-use patterns  
 described on page 1 are not clear.    
 The market gardening area seem to be  
 part of a much larger area extending  
 beyond the block to Wickham and       
 southwards into the west of Fareham.  
 It may be linked to the  proximety of 
 the large cities of Southampton and   
 Portsmouth or to the historical       
 location of strawberry farming in this
 area, a similarly labour intensive    
 system of farming. Market gardening   
 within the study area does seem to be 
 restricted to the soils developed on  
 the Bagshot Sands and certainly the   
 farmers in the rest of the area       
 frequently complained about poor      
 drainage due to the underlying London 
 Clay.
