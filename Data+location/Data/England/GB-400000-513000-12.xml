		<title>12A66 Trunk Road</title>
		<content>  The A66 is a major road that runs    
 between Teesside and Workington{(East 
{to West Coast).                       
  The section of the road going through
 this block area was originally a Roman
 road and so tends to be very straight.
  Major alterations began in{March 1981
 and were completed in{June 1983.}These
 alterations involved flattening hills 
 and creating a new dual carriageway.  
 Some local quarries were re-opened for
 stone and ballast.Farm houses and     
 buildings on the new route had to be  
 demolished and rebuilt nearby.        
  The road improvements mean that the  
 heavy traffic now moves more easily   
 and safely with much less congestion  
 on Galley Hill.                       
  Many wayside buildings were once     
 coaching inns.Gallows Inn was the most
 famous,for highwaymen were hanged on  
 Gallows Hill (now called Galley Hill).</content>
