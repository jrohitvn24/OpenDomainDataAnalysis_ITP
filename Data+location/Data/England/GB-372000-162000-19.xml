		<content> LISA AND HELEN WENT OUT TO SEE WHICH  
 GAMES THE INFANTS WERE PLAYING. WE    
 DIVIDED THEM INTO BOYS' GAMES, GIRLS' 
 GAMES AND MIXED GAMES.                
  THESE ARE SOME OF THE GAMES THE{BOYS 
 WERE PLAYING: RUNNING, CARS, CLIMBING 
 AND 40_40. 40_40 IS A GAME LIKE HIDE  
 AND SEEK BUT YOU COUNT TO 40 AND WHEN 
 YOU TOUCH THE POST YOU SAY "40_40     
 IN".                                  
  THESE ARE SOME OF THE{GIRLS'}GAMES:  
 IN AND OUT THE WINDOWS, SKIPPING,     
 SCHOOL, RING A RING O' ROSES AND      
 SINGING. IN AND OUT THE WINDOWS IS    
 WHEN SOMEONE GOES IN AND OUT OF PEOPLE
 SINGING A SONG. WHO THE PERSON STOPS  
 AT THEN GOES ON WITH THEM IN AND OUT  
 OF THE PEOPLE.                        
  THESE ARE SOME OF THE{MIXED}GAMES:   
 BULLDOGS, HOUSES, CHASING AND TRAINS.
