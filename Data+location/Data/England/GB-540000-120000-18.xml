		<title>18HISTORIC HOUSES OF NEWICK</title>
		<content> Many of the old homes and farmhouses  
 of Newick have been bought by wealthy 
 people and restored to a very high    
 standard.'Gentrification'has taken    
 place - as one local put it.The oldest
 house in this area is Founthill, built
 in the 13th century - once a single-  
 storeyed, timber-framed house with a  
 thatched roof. Houses built in the    
 16th century were Bretts, Ketches,    
 Church Farm (now Manor House),        
 Mackerells and Goldbridge Farm.       
 Shortly after this came Gypps, Tile   
 House, Ridgelands, Sharpsbridge,      
 Rotherfield, Snells and Cuttings (the 
 old Tudor workhouse). Other grand old 
 houses are The Old Rectory and        
 Beechlands. Many of these houses are  
 to be found near the Church, in'Newick
 proper', as opposed to 'Newick Green',
 as the two areas were once known.
