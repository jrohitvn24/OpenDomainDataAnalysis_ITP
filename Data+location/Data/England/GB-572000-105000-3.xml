		<content> The town today forms{three zones.}    
 The first is the{Old Town,}located in 
 the centre-north of our block. The    
 oldest houses are from the 17th and   
 18th centuries, and are now either    
 large dwellings or antique shops or   
 restaurants where the atmosphere of   
 the Old Town is a business attraction.
 The second is the{Victorian}area      
 centred around the station and        
 extending down to the seafront. It is 
 comprised mostly of large 3 and 4     
 storey terraced housing used for      
 commercial purposes in the centre with
 boarding houses and old peoples homes 
 surrounding that. Hotels almost       
 exclusively cover the seafront.       
 The third is the{modern}area to the   
 east and west of the Victorian area.  
 Near the seafront buildings are       
 multi-storey flats. Inland there are  
 detached and semi-detached houses.    </content>
