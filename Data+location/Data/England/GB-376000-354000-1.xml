		<title>01The History Of Alsager</title>
		<content> Alsager is situated in the S.E. corner
 of Cheshire.  It covers an area of    
 over 2000 acres and has a population  
 of 11,600.  In the original Domesday  
 Book it is quoted as being owned by   
 the Earl of Chester.  Before 1066 it  
 belonged to an Anglo Saxon called     
 Uluric, and the area payed very little
 tax.  We are also told the farm land  
 was only sufficient for one oxen to   
 plough in one season, and that most of
 the land was waste - worth one        
 shilling in tax. During the 18th C a  
 church was built. In the 19th C the   
 railway was built and many pottery    
 managers and workers started to live  
 in Alsager. Since WW2 improved        
 transport - M6 and rail links plus    
 accessiblity to Manchester - airport, 
 Wales and the North have made it a    
 popular place to live.
