		<title>05N.U.M. Strike continued.</title>
		<content> As the strike wore on enormous stock  
 piles of coal built up and interrupted
 the work schedules.The restoration of 
 some land had to be halted as had the 
 excavating of new seams.A crushing    
 plant was brought to the site and all 
 coal produced since the strike began  
 has been processed on site and        
 transported directly to power stations
 in Yorkshire.A weigh station had to be
 built.N.U.M.members did not picket the
 site,but did make regular visits to   
 Buckhead to ensure that no coal was   
 being moved away.After a visit to the 
 Opencast Site and having seen the     
 different stratas of earth,we can     
 hardly believe that one day in the    
 near future it will be flat farm land 
 again. We will always remember what   
 lies underneath.
