		<title>16Cubs and Scouts, Goatacre.</title>
		<content> Some of the boys in our area go to    
 cubs in Goatacre.The cub pack is      
 called Goatacre 1st and meets at      
 Goatacre Village Hall every Monday.Our
 two leaders are Akela,Mick Stoddart   
 and Shere Khan,Fred Taylor.Our pack   
 has two sixes, red and blue.On June   
 24th the pack went on a trip to RAF   
 Lyneham.When the cubs are old enough  
 they can become Scouts.               
 Our Scout troop in Goatacre is called 
 1st Goatacre Scout troop and is run by
 Skip, Fred Taylor and Tony Twigg.     
 Our meetings are from 17.30 until     
 19.30. At the beginning we try for    
 certain proficiency badges and then we
 have one or two games like Pin-down   
 and murder-ball and then we do other  
 things till flag down. Then one of the
 troop goes and lowers the union flag  
 and then we have a prayer before we   
 go home.                              </content>
