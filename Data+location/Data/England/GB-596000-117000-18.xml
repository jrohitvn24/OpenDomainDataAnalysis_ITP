		<content> The church was built in l936 to       
 replace the one destroyed during the  
 l939/45 war.  The vicarage is next    
 door to the church.  There have been  
 several changes in the incumbent in   
 the last few years, but now the vicar 
 is a family man.  The church is a     
 focal centre, and if the services are 
 not regularly attended, the bazaars   
 and other social events draw people   
 together, and gives the village a     
 symbol of unity.  During the summer   
 months the church opens its doors to  
 Roman Catholic Services.  The sunday  
 school is well attended, and other    
 events for the younger members of the 
 community are gaining considerable    
 interest.  The influence is subtle but
 it is a small but beautiful church    
 which adds character to the village.
