   Most children have to wear school   
uniform when they come to school.This  
includes shirt with collar and cuffs,a 
tie,a jumper,a blazer and skirt or     
trousers.When we leave school most of  
us will change into casual clothes     
which will probably be jeans,a         
tee-shirt and a sweat shirt.These are  
about the most comfortable clothes     
there are.For sports people wear shorts
made of cotton and a cotton shirt.If it
is cold people might wear a new sort of
clothing called Jogging suits.These are
made of warm materials which are       
warm.They are fairly large and hang    
loosely.These are used for sport       
as well.More formal clothes would be a 
tie,a shirt and a pair of trousers.
