		<content>  This public house has been going for 
 many years. Many years ago it would   
 have been only a brewery and the big  
 barrels of beer would have been taken 
 around the village and sold, but this 
 was when there were few means of      
 transport and then, when              
 communication increased people were   
 able to get to the brewery and it     
 became a public house. The opening    
 hours are from ten a.m. until 2.30    
 p.m. In the summer it re-opens at six 
 thirty p.m. and closes at eleven p.m. 
 but in winter it still opens at six   
 thirty but closes at ten p.m.         
  Many people used to go to the public 
 house but now even more come, because 
 of the great increase in tourism      
 around Salisbury. Public houses can be
 very interesting. On the walls are    
 pictures and badges of many years ago.
