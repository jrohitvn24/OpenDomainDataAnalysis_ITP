		<title>07Light Industry in Debenham.</title>
		<content>  Debenham has some light industry     
which mainly supports the agricultural 
community it serves.                   
  Bloomfield and Sons,Agricultural     
Engineers,is a family firm started by  
Mr M. Bloomfield,who served an         
apprenticeship at Garretts of Leiston. 
He set up a business in Debenham where 
he serviced steam traction engines,then
widely used.The workshops are still    
situated alongside the south entrance  
to the Parish Church,with a newer site 
nearby.                                
  The firm installs farm machinery,    
small mechanical mills,pumps and       
electrical equipment.It also sells a   
full range of farm tools.              
  A plastics factory is at present     
under construction,where Christmas     
decorations will be manufactured.There 
has been some opposition to this with  
several debates at the planning stage. </content>
