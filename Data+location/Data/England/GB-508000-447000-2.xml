		<title>02FARMING</title>
		<content> The main farming type is Arable. The  
 crops include wheat and barley.       
 Recently there has been an increase in
 the amount of oil seed rape grown.    
 This is now an important crop in the  
 area. The cereals grown are used for  
 animal feed.                          
 DAIRY FARMING                         
 There are a few dairy farms, but these
 have been reduced because of the      
 E.E.C. regulations on milk quotas.    
 The main cattle reared for milking are
 Fresians.                             
 OTHER TYPES OF FARMING                
 Some farms keep sheep and some pigs   
 although the latter are not as widely 
 kept as other areas of                
 Holderness.Potatoes are a widely grown
 crop.
