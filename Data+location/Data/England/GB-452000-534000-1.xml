		<content>     {By Mary Gray.}                   
 The Headland of Hartlepool was the    
 original town before the Victorian    
 town of West Hartlepool was built; it 
 is therefore known to residents as the
{Old Town}The Headland contains H/Pool 
 Docks and a fishing industry still    
 exists from the Fish Quay. There is a 
 variety of housing including council  
 and private, with a conservation area 
 situated mainly around Marine Drive   
 and Croft Gardens. There is one main  
 shopping street{(Northgate).}A variety
 of ships come and go and the Dock     
 activities are related to those of    
 Tees-side.There are two primary       
 schools-St. Bega's (R.C.) and St.     
 Helen's Primary.Many street names     
 reflect the existance of the Medieval 
 Friary,and parts of the Old Town Wall 
 still exist as does the Lighthouse at 
 Croft Terrace.                        </content>
