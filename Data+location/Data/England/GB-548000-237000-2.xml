		<content>   Littlebury is a small village with a
{population}of approximately 350 people
 .The main landcover is residential    
 with a public playing field,a         
 foodstore/ post office,a police       
 station, a telephone box,a bus        
 stop/service and a{church}with a      
 vicarage.There used to be 3 public    
 houses in the village,but now there is
 only 1,"The Queen's Head" .There used 
 to be a library in the High Street but
 now it is no longer there.On average  
 30-40 people attend the church on a   
 regular basis,nearly 10% of the       
 population ,which is  quite a good    
 congregation by any standards. The    
 church was origionally built in the   
 14th Century,but since then parts of  
 it have either been renovated or      
 rebuilt.Although quite old,the church 
 is not the oldest building in         
 Littlebury.                           </content>
