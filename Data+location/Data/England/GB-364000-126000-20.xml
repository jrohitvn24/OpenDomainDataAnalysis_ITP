		<content> would not affect her children.        
   However she is very anxious about   
 her eldest child.He is just about to  
 begin his secondary schooling.She has 
 fears about the school itself and     
 regrets the lack of choice available, 
 transport by the local authority is   
 only provided for this one school.This
 she realises is one of the drawbacks  
 of living in the country.In general   
 terms she is unhappy with the         
 comprehensive system of education and 
 would prefer the old segregated system
 of grammar and secondary modern       
 schools.                              
   Her future has its uncertainties,   
 the farm her husband works on is to be
 sold which could necessitate they're  
 looking for another place.She seemed  
 confident of they're finding one.
