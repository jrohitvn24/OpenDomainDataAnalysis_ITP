 THEY DID IN THE PAST.{INDOORS,        
 CHILDREN PLAY BOARD GAMES BUT MOSTLY  
 THEY PLAY WITH MODEL FIGURES AND CARS,

 TIME JUST WATCHING TELEVISION AND     
 VIDEO FILMS.{OUTDOORS,}CHILDREN PLAY  
 FOOTBALL OR CRICKET, BIKE RIDING,     
 ROLLER SKATING OR MADE_UP GAMES IN THE
 STREET. THERE IS A{BOYS CLUB}IN THE   
 WHADDON ESTATE WHICH ORGANISES EVENTS 
 AND OUTINGS, DISCOS AND SPORTS        
 ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FOOTBALL, JUDO AND
