		<title>10PLAYGROUND GAMES.</title>
		<content>   One of our favourite games is       
 Downhill Chickens.This is how you     
 play.                                 
   1. Upto ten people can play.        
   2. The person who is 'on' is called 
 the snake.All the others are called   
 chickens.                             
   3. The snake has to count upto ten  
 slowly while the chickes run out of   
 the den.                              
   4. Each person has to run with their
 hands on their knees.                 
   5. The snake has to 'dob' a chicken 
 before they can get back to the den.  
   6. If anyone takes their hands off  
 their knees they are automatically    
 'on'.                                 
   7. If the snake 'dobs' a chicken,   
 that chicken is the new snake and the 
 old snake becomes a chicken.
