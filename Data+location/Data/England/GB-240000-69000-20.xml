		<title>20Parish Council - Calstock</title>
		<content>        The  Calstock  Parish  Council,
 which was formed in  1894,  now has 15
 members,  5  from  Gunnislake, 3  from
 Calstock, 2 from  Harrowbarrow, 4 from
 Delaware  and 1 from  Metherell.  Soon
 there will be 17 members.In 1984 there
 was  a  count  of  the people  in  our
 parish and the  total  was  5200.  The
 council gets Â£2600 to spend for public
 lighting, parks, public footpaths  and
 open spaces.  At present the  Manpower
 Services have built a tennis court and
 improved the Recreation Field.        
       When the  council  has  meetings
 it  has  them   in   Delaware  Primary
 School.  The  council takes complaints
 from the public and sends them to  the
 District   or  County   Councils.  The
 Council is  trying to make a scheme to
 repair the Public  Hall at Gunnislake.
 It has also given  Â£1000 to help build
 a new Village Hall at Harrowbarrow.   </content>
