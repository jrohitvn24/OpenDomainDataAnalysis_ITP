		<title>07Farming in Eaton Bray area</title>
		<content> Sadly, the old Wallace nurseries and  
 plum orchards, with 8 acres of        
 greenhouses, formerly the largest     
 employer of local labour and famous   
 for its roses and carnations has now  
 been converted to housing development.
    Farming is now the major land user,
 with seven farms and two agricultural 
 contractors in the area. About half   
 the land is cultivated, mainly for    
 wheat and barley; the remainder is    
 managed grassland, much of it used    
 for grazing riding horses and ponies. 
    Currently there is one milking herd
 and another farmer raises cattle for  
 beef. A new council-built farm has    
 been empty for over a year as farmers 
 cannot afford the rent, due to EEC    
 cuts in milk quotas.                  
    One horticultural concern sells    
 plants to garden centres and a new    
 concern is establishing a nursery.    </content>
