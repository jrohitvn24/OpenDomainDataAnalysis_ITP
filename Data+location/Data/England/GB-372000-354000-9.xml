		<content> Although the area lies  along a busy  
 main road the effects of work         
 connected with the road are minimal   
 and much of the landscape remains     
 unchanged .Similarly the new housing  
 developments attempt to merge with the
 character of the area.                
 The natural rural environment remains 
 unchanged by development and the      
 farming community farm the land with  
 conservation in mind.                 
 There are many areas of woodland and  
 major replanting is going on notably  
 in the woodland area of Park Farm.    
 Wildlife is rich. There appears to be 
 a lot of rabbits this year  causing   
 damage to barley crops.               
 The area is a "flat" area devoted     
 mainly to dairy farming and crop      
 growing so the landscape is shaped by 
 these activities.
