		<title>18BMX Bicycles in S.on A.</title>
		<content> Recreation. BMX bicycles are designed 
 for cross country racing or for       
 freestyle stunt riding.The bikes which
 most children ride can do both.They   
 have a very strong frame, studded     
 tyres and padding on all sharp edges. 
 The riders wear padding on their knees
 and elbows,a suit of tough material,  
 gloves and a safety helmet complete   
 with visor and dust mask.Many boys and
 some girls have a BMX bike and use it 
 as an ordinary bicycle as well as for 
 rough use.The bikes can be ridden     
 anywhere but should not be used on the
 pavement.Stratford has its own BMX    
 track.It is on the Warwick Road behind
 the Leisure Centre.As you go down from
 the starter gate you come to a speed  
 ramp then you go round a burn,over a  
 pyramid ramp,round another burn,then  
 over the whoops.It is easy to fall and
 you will need the padding!            </content>
