		<title>07My visit to Hopton Farm.</title>
		<content>                                       
    Hopton Farm is a dairy farm which  
grows corn and grass for silage.       
The farm covers about 300 acres,and    
employs 4 people.                      
   They have installed computers to    
assist with their work. The  98 cows   
are milked at 5:45 in the morning and  
again at 3:45 in the afternoon.        
   They feed the cows on grass,corn and
silage.The milk the cows give goes to  
Birmingham Co-op.They breed their own  
cows.These are the pieces of machinery 
we saw ;5 tractors,a forage            
harvester,a bailer,a plough,a sprayer, 
an elevator,a harrow and a mill and    
mixer.The way calves sucked the ladyÂ£s 
fingers,without hurting her,interested 
me!      Glyn Thomas  aged 9.
