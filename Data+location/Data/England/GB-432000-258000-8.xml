		<title>08THE CHILDREN - CHESTERTON</title>
		<content> There are 12 children in the          
 Chesterton area. Only 2 children go   
 to the Combined School in Harbury.One 
 goes to Southam High School, one to a 
 Combined Church School in Southam and 
 the rest go to private schools.The    
 two in Harbury  who have lived in the 
 village all their lives, travel to    
 school by taxi. It is paid for by  the
 County Council. Their parents work at 
 local farms.Often in winter the       
 village is cut off by the snow and the
 children cannot go to school. They go 
 shopping in Leamington Spa. There are 
 no organized activities for the       
 children in the area. In their spare  
 time they play in the woods and       
 fields.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
