 Nearly half the people who go to work 
 go on trains.The local underground    
 station has a direct line to London   
 which enables people to travel to work
 easily.Some people use the buses for  
 travelling to work but often these are
 used for going shopping. Family cars  
 are used mainly to visit places and   
 are useful for doing the family       
 shopping.                             
 There is one car travelling on the    
 Cranbrook Road every three seconds and
 one every 10 seconds on the Drive.The 
 roads are very congested in this area.
 In Wanstead Park they are building a  
 motorway.They have taken away all the 
 grass, trees and railings in a certain
 part of the field.
