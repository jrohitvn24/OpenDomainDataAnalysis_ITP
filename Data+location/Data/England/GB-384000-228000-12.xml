		<content> The new{village hall}was designed     
 and built by members of the new       
 community of Apperley. It is situated 
 by the playing fields where there is a
 football, tennis and netball area. The
 village hall was finished on 14th     
 February 1985, financed by the sale   
 of the land of the old village hall   
 for Â£52,500 for{residential           
{development.}Local men were the       
 architect and builder. A fund was     
 set up to raise the balance for the   
 building of the hall; large companies 
 such as Dowty &amp; Rank Xerox also       
 donated money. The total cost of the  
 hall was Â£67,O5O. The hall consists of
 nine rooms, including a toilet with   
 facilities for the disabled,a kitchen 
 and the main hall. Criticisms have    
 been made about its peripheral        
 position &amp; lack of stage facilities.
