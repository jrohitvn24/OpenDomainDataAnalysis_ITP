		<title>04THE SCHOOL SYSTEM  BRIDGE</title>
		<content> I started Bridge School when I was 5  
 years old.Before I came to school     
 Iwent to Mrs.Webb's Play School at    
 Kingston. There is another Play School
 called Mrs.Rook's.Since I have been at
 school I have had two Headteachers.   
 One called Miss Tomlin and one called 
 Mr.Farley.My eldest brother left this 
 School in 1982,and my sister left in  
 1984.They both go to Geoffrey Chaucer 
 School in Canterbury. When my youngest
 brother and I leave Bridge School we  
 will probably go to Geoffrey Chaucer. 
 It is a Comprehensive School. This    
 year 7 children from J4 will go to the
 Frank Montgomery Secondary Modern     
 School (Sturry),6 will go to the Simon
 Langton Grammar School,4 will go to   
 the Geoffrey Chaucer, 1 will go to    
 Aylesham Sec.Mod and 1 to the Arch-   
 bishop's Sec.Mod Canterbury,2 d'ont   
 know which school they will go to yet.</content>
