		<title>10FARMING IN THE SESSAY FIELDS</title>
		<content>{Modern farms}rely on machines. The    
 advent of the{tractor}and attachments 
 has speeded up the cultivation process
 and reduced the number of workers.    
 Fertilisers &amp; weedkillers ensure the  
 greatest crop-success rate. Modern    
 farming can alter landscape with newer
 crops like Oilseed Rape.{Large fields}
 are more economical to work so some   
 hedges have been removed. Continental 
 cattle can be seen but our native     
 Hereford is holding its own. There are
 also some{intensive breeding units}for
 pigs and poultry.                     
 In Sessay several farms still fatten  
 beef cattle with locally-grown root   
 crops and cereals and there is also   
 one{traditional mixed farm.}This has a
 dairy herd, free-range poultry and    
 pigs, and an arable acreage which     
 supports the livestock during Winter. 
 This type of farm is rare nowadays.   </content>
