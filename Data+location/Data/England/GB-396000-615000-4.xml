		<content> As one would expect,the vegetation of 
 the area varies with soil-type and    
 altitude. The valley floors are mostly
 sandy and well-drained. Here the      
 vegetation is mostly grass with       
 smaller areas of whin and gorse and   
 even some foxglove. As one walks      
 higher up the valley sides the        
 vegetation changes to bracken and     
 heather with smaller areas of bog     
 vegetation. Other flowers found in    
 this region of 500- 1500' include     
 foxglove, bedstraw, potentilla,       
 vetch, cotton-grass and varied        
 grasses. On the uppermost slopes      
 the main vegetation is heather and    
 tussocky grass. There are some areas  
 of bog and associated plants but      
 drainage is being carried out by      
 farmers and forestry thus destroying  
 large areas of bog-loving vegetation.
