		<title>03THE RAILWAY MISSION CREWE</title>
		<content> The Railway Mission Church got it's   
 name because the Church used to be    
 down by Mornflake Oats next to the    
 railway line.This is an Evangelical   
 Church.It has been a Church for 5     
 years but before it became a Church it
 used to be an old cheese factory.At   
 the Church they have regular Sunday   
 morning services.There is a separate  
 room for children and their age       
 groups.Here are some examples:        
 Toddlers from the age of 2 and 9,     
 Juco's for children aged 10 and 11,   
 Covananters for children aged 13 to   
 18.                                   
   At the church baptisms ,weddings,   
 and funerals take place.There is also 
 a meeting for older people and a      
 mother's meeting for mothers who have 
  children.Anyone is welcome to come   
 and take part in the services.
