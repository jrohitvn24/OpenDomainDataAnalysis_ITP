		<title>07OLD BUILDINGS,SOMERFORD AREA</title>
		<content>   Right next to Great Somerford Church
 is another old building called the    
 Mount House.This was one of two manor 
 houses in Great Somerford which were  
 built for the two nobles between whom 
 the village was divided after the     
 Norman Conquest.The present owners of 
 the Mount House are Major and Mrs P.  
 Phillips who are the parents of Capt. 
 Mark Phillips,the husband of Princess 
 Anne.                                 
   In Little Somerford there are also  
 several old houses,one of which we    
 were invited to visit by the present  
 owner,Mr.Clifford.It has a Mansard    
 roof and is built with red bricks.The 
 original beams are still to be seen in
 the kitchen with their meat hooks. On 
 these hooks joints of meat wrapped in 
 muslin were hung for storage.The      
 original shutters with iron bars are  
 still in place at the windows.        </content>
