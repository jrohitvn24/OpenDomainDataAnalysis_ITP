		<title>04Wycomb And Chadwell</title>
		<content> Wycomb is a very small village, where 
 most of the houses are built of       
 ironstone or an old locally produced  
 brick. The roofs are mostly pantiles  
 or Swithland slate . Most houses were 
 originally farm houses or cottages.   
 There are only two more modern houses.
    One old house was once the site of 
 a graveyard then a barn was built     
 on it and later a cottage.  Mr and Mrs
 Clemons and their family extended the 
 cottage to make the present house,    
 finding many old bones in their       
 garden.                               
    Chadwell is even smaller than      
 Wycomb, with only 10 houses, but it   
 does have a church, St Mary's, which  
 serves both villages.                 
  There are no shops in either village.
 People must go to Scalford or Melton  
 Mowbray to shop.
