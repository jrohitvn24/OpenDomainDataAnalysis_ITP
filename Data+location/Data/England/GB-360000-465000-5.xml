		<content> In Wray, there is a coal merchant, a  
 postman who with his wife runs the    
 Post Office and village store; a      
 policeman, a vicar, a plumber, joiner 
 and builders, a newsagent, and a      
 hairdresser who visits people's       
 houses. There is a curio shop and two 
 Public Houses.                        
 The percentage of people commuting to 
 Lancaster and Morecambe, or other     
 towns or villages, is rising. Among   
 these are teachers, engineers and     
 solicitors, office, shop and hotel    
 workers. There is little unemployment 
 in Wray.                              
 Most of the people in the fell areas  
 live and work there. The local farms  
 provide a livelihood for a majority of
 the inhabitants. The farmworkers are  
 mainly relatives who live close by.
