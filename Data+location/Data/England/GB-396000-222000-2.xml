		<title>02PRESTBURY VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{ PRESTBURY}IS A VILLAGE SITED ON THE  
 OUTSKIRTS OF CHELTENHAM ON THE MAIN   
 ROAD TOWARDS WINCHCOMBE.{THE HEART}OF 
 THE VILLAGE IS BUILT AROUND THE{HIGH  
{STREET AND THE BURGAGE.}THERE ARE A   
 GREAT NUMBER OF OLD BUILDINGS DATING  
 BACK TO THE 15th CENTURY. THE CHURCH  
 OF ST. MARY'S IS{NORMAN}IN FOUNDATION.
  THE VILLAGE IS A{POPULAR AREA}IN     
 WHICH TO LIVE, BEING AN ATTRACTIVE    
 PLACE AND BEING CLOSE TO THE COTSWOLD 
 HILLS. ALTHOUGH CHELTENHAM HAS        
 ENCROACHED UPON PRESTBURY AND THERE IS
 NO OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO, THE    
 VILLAGERS DO NOT REGARD THEMSELVES AS 
 BEING A PART OF THE TOWN.             
  LIFE IN THE VILLAGE IS RELATIVELY    
{SELF-CONTAINED,}BUT THE RESIDENTS RELY
 ON ACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE IN AND     
 AROUND TOWN, SOME OF WHICH, SUCH AS   
 THE CHELTENHAM RACE MEETINGS, AFFECT  
 THE VILLAGE CONSIDERABLY.             </content>
