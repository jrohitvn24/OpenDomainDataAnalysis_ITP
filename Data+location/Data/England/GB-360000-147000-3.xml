		<content> Oakhill is situated on the main road  
 to Bath.The only industry is          
 brewing.It has a village school with  
 113 children who go to surrounding    
 towns for secondary school. The houses
 are a mixture of old cottages, newly  
 converted old buildings and modern    
 architect designed houses. There are  
 three very large old houses_ one now  
 used as a restaurant,one as a museum  
 and the third still a privately owned 
 estate.Most people leave the village  
 for employment in nearby towns and    
 cities of Bath and Bristol. Local     
 events centre around the church and   
 the school like fetes and jumble      
 sales. There is a village Cricket and 
 Football Club; a choir that has won   
 alot of competitions, a band and many 
 other clubs for young and old people.
