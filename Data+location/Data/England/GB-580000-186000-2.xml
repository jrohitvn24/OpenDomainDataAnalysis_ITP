		<title>02Landscape: Urban Development</title>
		<content>   Urban development in the last 50    
 years has overtaken much of this area.
 Only narrow belts of{farmland}less    
 than 1Km. wide are left around the    
 village of Daws Heath and on Hadleigh 
 Downs.{Belfairs Park}and just over 100
 hectares of{woodland}remain but they  
 are almost surrounded by{housing.}    
 Despite the fact that these remaining 
 open spaces have green belt status,   
 the area north-west of Daws Heath has 
 been under threat of further          
 residential development in recent     
 years.                                
   The most recent housing developments
 are new estates east of West Wood;    
 south of the Great Wood and north-east
 of Belfairs - together with minor     
 additions to the east end of Daws     
 Heath.
