 A bailer is a machine which picks up  
 hay or straw and makes it into blocks

{The Mower}cuts the grass. Then you    
 wait for the sun to make it go brown  
 and then it is bailed. People do      
 silaging as well now. They cut the    
 grass and then pick it up with a      
 machine which dumps it into a great   
 big trailer. The cut grass is stored  
 under black polythene to ferment.
