		<title>11THE FREE MINERS</title>
		<content>   The traditional                     
 rights and privileges of the Free     
 Miners were protected in 1946 by the  
 Coal Industry Nationalisation Act.    
 A miner has to be born within the     
 Hundred of St. Briavels, to be over 21
 years of age and to have worked for at
 least a year and a day in a coal or   
 iron mine  within its boundaries to   
 qualify to become a Free Miner.  He   
 then has the right to claim from the  
 crown a place to work for his own     
 profit in either coal or iron ore     
 within the Hundred. There are still a 
 few  Free Miners working in this way  
 today.                                
   It is common to hear foresters      
 addressing their friends as "O        
 but".This is a legacy of coalmining   
 days when your workmate was your      
 "butty".You relied on each other for  
 your safety and livelihood.           </content>
