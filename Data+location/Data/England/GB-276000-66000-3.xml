		<title>03Farming in Landscove</title>
		<content> The soil here has much to do with the 
 type of {farming. }It is mostly a red 
 type of clay that encourages rich     
 growth especially grass. The {dairy } 
 farmers are able to take two or three 
 crops of silage,as well as hay to feed
 their animals in the winter.The soil  
 is also well-suited to the growth of  
 kale and beet for winter feed.The     
 farmers often use a low voltage       
 electric fence to control the rate at 
 which the animals feed you have to be 
 careful of these if you have wet boots
 on. The Large tanker lorries visit the
 area every day to take away the milk  
 that is produced by the Friesian      
 cows.One or two farmers still have    
 jersey{cows}but the total is only some
 30 animals.{Sheep}are also reared and 
 tend to graze the land that is too    
 steep to farm or unsuitable for the   
 cows .                                </content>
