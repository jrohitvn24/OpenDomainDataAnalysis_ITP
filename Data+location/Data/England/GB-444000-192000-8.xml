		<title>08Drayton Village</title>
		<content> The name Drayton is of Anglo-Saxon    
 origin and probably means "the place  
 where sledges were used"-a reference  
 to the marshy land outside the        
 village.Most of the old village houses
 were destroyed in 1780 in the Great   
 Fire of Drayton but a few houses like 
 The Grange escaped destruction.The    
 Baptist Church is an early 19th       
 century building and both public      
 houses were known in the 19th century.
