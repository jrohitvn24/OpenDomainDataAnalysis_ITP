		<title>11Alcester Sports Complex</title>
		<content>      A 100,000 scheme has been       
 announced to change Alcester Rugby    
 Club into a multi-sports complex.It   
 includes four flood-lit, all-weather  
 courts and a hockey pitch, as well as 
 rugby pitches. Other facilities such  
 as those for archery will be developed
 later. Work is likely to start on the 
 club house first to provide two sets  
 of changing rooms, a large lounge and 
 a bar at a cost of 40,000.           
      The scheme was announced by Rugby
 Club officials and Alcester's newly   
 formed Tennis Club committee. At      
 present the nearest outdoor centre is 
 8 miles away, so the complex will be  
 an asset to the area. It will not     
 compete with the Alcester Sports Hall 
 because this provides only for indoor 
 activities such as squash, badminton  
 and volley-ball.
