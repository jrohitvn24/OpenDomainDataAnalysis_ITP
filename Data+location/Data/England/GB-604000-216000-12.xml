 A three year crop rotation on the     
 gravel,and a two year rotation on the 
 marshy areas is used.                 
 The grain is stored in eighteen silos 
 in three large barns,each silo        
 holding 40 tonnes.Much of the grain is
 sold to a company in Ardleigh.In the  
 past the silos had to be shovelled by 
 hand,but now the grain is scked out   
 by a large vacuum machine.The         
 farm owns three tractors,one combine  
 harvester,one fertiliser spray,one    
 seed drill,and one plough.Consequently
 only three men work it,whereas in 1950
 it would have needed at least eleven. 
 Until recently 123 cattle were reared 
 on grassland,on reclaimed gravel pits.
 The newly bought calves,were fattened 
 for two years for beef.               
 Now only a few chickens,ducks and dogs
 are kept on the farm.                 </content>
