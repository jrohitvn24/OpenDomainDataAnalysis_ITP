		<content>   11.00 am                            
           We were told to go to Mr    
 Morgan.  We went and talked ,about the
 Domesday Project.  We had to compare  
 our work with children in the same    
 group as us in another class.  When we
 had finished we went to art.          
                                       
   12.00 am                            
           It was 12.00 now so there   
 was not much time left, but we still  
 did some work.  I did my weaving.  I  
 went wrong so I had to unpick it.     
 When I had got it right again there   
 was only ten minutes left so I got on 
 quickly.  When the bell rang it was   
 time for lunch.  I had cheese and     
 tomato sandwiches with a Mars bar and 
 an apple.  Then I went outside and    
 talked to Lucy, Lizzy and Amy.  Then  
 we played marbles.
