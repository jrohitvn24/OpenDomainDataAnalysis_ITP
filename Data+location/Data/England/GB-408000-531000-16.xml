		<title>16THE VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  The school, opened in 1964,replacing 
 the village hall,stands in the centre 
 of the village with a picturesque view
 of farmland to the south.It has its   
 own gardens,playing field,adventure   
 play area and playground marked out to
 provide many games and activities.    
  Insidethe building are two classrooms
 with sliding doors opening on to an   
 assembly hall.                        
  Attendance at the school has declined
 from about 60 infants and juniors in  
 1979 to only 28 in 1985,mainly due to 
 a decrease in the birthrate.The       
 children come from a wide catchment   
 area which includes the forest,the    
 village and outlying farms.Many are   
 brought in by mini-bus or cars.Most of
 the children stay for school meals    
 brought in from a central kitchen,or  
 have packed lunch.
