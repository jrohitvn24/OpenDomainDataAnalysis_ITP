		<content> In 1891 West Herts and Watford St.    
 Mary's Football Clubs amalgamated to  
 form Watford Football Club. The       
 Vicarage Road ground was bought by    
 Benskins in 1921 and leased to Watford
 Football Club. The capacity of the    
 ground is 28,462. Graham Taylor, the  
 manager, took Watford from the fourth 
 division in 1977 to the first division
 in 1982. Watford F.C. have a special  
 terrace and enclosure for families,   
 the only one in the country. Watford  
 have never won an F.A. Cup Final but  
 in 1984 they lost 2-0 in the final to 
 Everton F.C. Elton John is Watford's  
 Chairman, he has spent millions of    
 pounds on the club and he has helped  
 buy players. Elton John is well known 
 all around the world because of his   
 singing.
