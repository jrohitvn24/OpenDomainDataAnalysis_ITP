		<title>04COMMUNITY SERVICE SCHEME</title>
		<content> This year,75 of our 5th year pupils   
 were involved in our scheme,helping 18
 different "organisations" in the area 
 and 10 different couples or individ-  
 -uals in their own homes.             
 In the 4th year our pupils  helped a  
 further 6 "organisations" and 3       
 couples on Thursday afternoons.As well
 as this we opened the Gleneagles      
 Avenue Recreation Centre each Thursday
 afternoon from September to Easter and
 entertained some of the elderly       
 residents from Valley House and the   
 Wycliffe Home for the Blind.          
 Our scheme is,without doubt,generating
 a lot of good  will in the area and,  
 for two years running,we have won     
 awards in the National Westminster    
 Bank's Project Respond scheme.In      
 1983/4 we won the first prize of Â£350 
 and in 1984/5  we won the second prize
 of Â£250.                              </content>
