		<title>16A KIVETON CHILD'S DAY 1986</title>
		<content> Life for a Kiveton child isn't very   
 different from anywhere else really.  
 At {school}we do maths, English,      
 reading and nature work.   We also    
 have {school}dinners and we can choose
 what we want from fish fingers,       
 beefburgers, salads, pizza and other  
 dishes.   In assembly we have a prayer
 and sing.   At home I {watch}         
 television.   I have my tea.   On     
 Saturdays I go horse riding and I get 
 there by bus.   On Sundays I play out.
   Then on Mondays it is back to {     
{school.} We take assembly and         
 register, soon it is playtime.   In   
 playtime the boys usually play        
 football and the girls talk and eat   
 sweets.   Sometimes I go to the {     
{library}and get some books.   We have 
 a {park}where there are swings, slides
 and roundabouts.   You can play tennis
 there and also hire out golf clubs.   </content>
