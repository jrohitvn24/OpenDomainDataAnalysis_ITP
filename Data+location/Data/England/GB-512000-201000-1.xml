		<content>St.Albans and Watford are a few miles  
away from our block, which contains the
villages of Bricket Wood and How       
Wood.Each has about 3 or 4,000         
people;all the houses are well-spaced  
out,there are lots of trees,so it is a 
pleasant place to live in.There aren't 
many shops,and no cinemas or           
theatres,but it is easy to go to London
or the big towns,if you have a         
car.Sports facilities are good.        
Farmland surrounds the villages, and   
there are plenty of woods, so it is    
semi-rural.Public transport is not all 
that good,and people living in the     
villages rely on cars.Motorways and    
main roads surround the area,which make
it handy to travel.
