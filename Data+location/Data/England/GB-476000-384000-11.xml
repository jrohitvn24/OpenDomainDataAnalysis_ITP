		<content> The village school.                   
 The first tangible school building was
 erected in 1836 by the owner of the   
 parish,George Savile Foljambe Esq of  
 Osberton.The Foljambs still own a     
 large part of Sturton parish.The      
 school today is entitled"Sturton-Le   
 -steeple C of E (aided) primary school
 and it maintains it's strong links    
 with the church.There are 47 pupils on
 roll.In 1866 and 1879 additions were  
 made and improvements made to the     
 schoolhouse.The latter is now part of 
 the school and is used for classrooms 
 and staffrooms etc.The numbers on roll
 have fallen steadily over the years   
 and the school was once threatened    
 with closure.The school plays a very  
 active part in village life and it has
 a very good name educationally.There  
 is an excellent kitchen.
