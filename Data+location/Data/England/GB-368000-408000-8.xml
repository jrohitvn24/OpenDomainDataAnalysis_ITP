		<title>08ALBERT HALL FIRE,BOLTON</title>
		<content> Part of the Town Hall is occupied by  
 the Albert Hall and this great room   
 with its Victorian                    
 architecture is the pride of the      
 town.On 14th November 1981 a fire     
 started in the hall and for 5 hours it
 burned fiercely.The flames could be   
 seen for miles,especially in the      
 darkness.All the wooden screens,the   
 organ and seating was destroyed.Only  
 the thick Victorin walls saved the    
 rest of the Town Hall from damage or  
 even total destruction.Since then the 
 hall has been rebuilt;instead of one  
 great room with a high ceiling,an     
 extra floor has been added to make 2  
 rooms.The main one is still called the
 Albert Hall and has a new organ,a     
 stage,and seating for 1000 people.It  
 was reopened in May 1985 and is the   
 focus of town events.
