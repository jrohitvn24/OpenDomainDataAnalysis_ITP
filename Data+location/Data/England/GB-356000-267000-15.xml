		<content>  In Tenbury there are many buildings  
 mostly made up of houses and shops.   
  We did a survey of Berrington road   
 and found that there are 26 Detatched 
 houses, 21 Bungalows, 15 Semi         
 Detatched, 9 rows of 4 terraced       
 houses, a Police station, a farm shop,
 A Catholic church, and two building   
 sites. So there are mostly Detatched  
 houses in Berrington Road. Our next   
 survey was what type of house children
 in our School live in. There are 85   
 people who live in Semi Detatched, 67 
 live in Detatched, 20 who live in     
 cottages,14 who live in bungalows, 11 
 people who live in Terrace houses and 
 only 5 people who live in Flats.So    
 this time Semi Detatched is most      
 popular.                              
   Cornwall House is at the top of     
 Cross Street and is a large house. It 
 has small glass windows called Sash   </content>
