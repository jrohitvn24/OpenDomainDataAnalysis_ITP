		<content>  Mr Davis was interviewed during the  
survey. He could remember cutting corn 
for farmers in a meadow which has been 
covered by the houses at Roberts Road. 
  The only main road ran from Little   
Burstead to Laindon Station, but in    
1928 the A127 was opened by the Duke   
of Gloucester. Even by 1950 there were 
few cars in the area, unlike today.    
  In 1940 Mr Davis had left Laindon to 
join the Army. Laindon High Street had 
a number of shops and was the busiest  
part of Basildon. Now most of the shops
have closed and the Laindon Centre has 
been opened but even this is dwarfed by
Basildon Eastgate.                     
  Mr Davis had bought a plot of land   
for his house for 5 pounds but now it  
is worth 50,000 pounds.
