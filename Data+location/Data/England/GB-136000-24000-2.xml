		<content> One of the most famous coast radio    
 stations in the world - the Post      
 Offices{Lands End Radio}- has moved   
 home to new premises five miles to the
 south-west of the site at{St.Just     
 which it has occupied for 66 years.The
 move means an improved service for    
 seafarers using the station.          
   The transfer to the new site - at   
{Skewjack,}near{Sennen}- at a cost of  
 Â£92,000,is the latest stage in a      
 continuing programme by the Post      
 Office to modernise and expand its    
{maritime radio station.               
   The move has been made to provide   
 more space for the{Radio Officers}and 
 their equipment and to prevent the    
 transmitters,which are still at       
{St.Just}from causing interference to  
 the sensitive receiving equipment at  
{Skewjack.                             
                                       </content>
