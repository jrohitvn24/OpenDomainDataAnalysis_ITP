		<title>13Living in Walmer</title>
		<content> I like living in Walmer because it is 
 a quiet, small village{near the sea}  
 and there is an adequate supply of    
 facilities such as a small shopping   
 centre, restaurants and a great number
 of pubs. I also like it because you   
 can get to the{town and country}      
 easily. As Walmer is near to the port 
 of Dover you can go for an enjoyable  
 day to France. Walmer is interesting  
 to live in because of its{historical} 
 features. Apart from Walmer Castle,   
 there are several old churches which  
 are of special interest, aswell as the
 castles of Deal and Dover. The        
 disadvantages of living in Walmer are 
 mainly that there are{few sports      
{facilities,}the nearest sports centre 
 being at Dover, and there is no longer
 a cinema in the town. The local people
 are proud of their{heritage}and are a 
 small friendly community.             </content>
