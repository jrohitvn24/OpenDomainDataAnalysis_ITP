		<title>19SHEEP FARMING - HORTON KIRBY</title>
		<content>    The shepherd is typical of the farm
 workers in this area, son following   
 father and wives working on the farm. 
 He started at 14, working with, and   
 being trained by his father. He always
 uses 2 dogs, one young and one older  
 that respond to whistle and word      
 commands. He and his family live in a 
 farm cottage and his wife works on the
 farm.                                 
    Modern methods and the use of      
 innoculation have improved the health 
 and quality of the herd. Ewes are     
 fitter, often producing triplets.     
 Sheltered lambing pens, heat lamps and
 intravenous drips have increased the  
 percentage of live births.            
   Both meat and wool yield have       
 increased - lambs weighing 19 kilos at
 12 weeks are sold in French markets,  
 mutton goes to Europe and India, and  
 the wool is used in the Tweed industry</content>
