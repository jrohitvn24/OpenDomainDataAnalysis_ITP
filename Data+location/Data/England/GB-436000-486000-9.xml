		<content>{MR.AND MRS.PEARSON'S FARM.}           
 We visited Newsham Grange,the home of 
 Mr.and Mrs.Pearson.They have 89 cattle
 and 50 sheep.The sheep are half_bred  
 Swaledale and the Pearsons also have  
 two Jacob sheep.The sheep had already 
 been shorn and looked sort of bare.The
 cattle are Charolais cattle and these 
 cattle have been bred for beef.There  
 is also a Jersey cow used for milking.
 When we visited the farm the Jersey   
 cow had calved.There is a white bull  
 too.                                  
  The farm has 87 acres and the crop is
 mainly grass.Some hedges have been    
 rooted out so that the tractors could 
 work more easily.When we went to the  
 farm Mr.Pearson was busy turning hay  
 with a machine called a hay_turner.
