		<title>10RECREATION IN NORTH FAREHAM</title>
		<content> The two main leisure provisions in    
 this area are the public              
 footpaths,particularly those on       
 Wickham Common,and the shared use of  
 Knowle Hospital's sports facilities.  
 Wickham Common is an area of unfenced 
 grassland and has a riding stables  on
 it's northern edge by the A333.The    
 stables are popular with school       
 parties who spend about an hour       
 trekking across the common as part of 
 their physical education curriculum.  
 Families often hire ponies for an     
 evening or weekend trek.The footpaths 
 are used for rambling,B.M.X. bikes and
 unofficial motorbike Scrambling which 
 causes conflict between walkers and   
 riders.Dog owners who allow their     
 animals to defecate on the footpaths  
 are also causing concern.
