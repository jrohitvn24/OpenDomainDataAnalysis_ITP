		<content> In our area there is one small village
 called Barston.Most of the area is    
 farmland with a few woodlands.There   
 are 14 farms on the map.There is a    
 river called the River Blythe.It has  
 trout in it.There are lots of         
 footpaths in the fields,and there are 
 very few buildings.As well as our     
 school ,there is a special school     
 called Springfield House, two churches
 and some old almshouses.              
   In the eastern part of the block is 
 the enlarged village of Balsall       
 Common. Several large housing estates 
 have been built here giving a         
 combination of commuter suburb and    
 rural community.
