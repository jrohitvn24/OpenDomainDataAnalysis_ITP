		<title>16OUR MILKMAN</title>
		<content> The milkman in our area has a very    
 large round.He comes from the         
 Northwood branch of Express           
 Dairies.The milkman seems to get on   
 well with his customers.Milk has just 
 recently gone up in price and a lot of
 people were annoyed by this.The       
 milkman has a hard job,wich people    
 seem to take for granted.Sometimes he 
 will start at five in the morning and 
 not finish until two in the           
 afternoon.The van he works with is    
 terrible but they can not afford a new
 one.The milkman has to put up with a  
 lot of unecessary complaints.At the   
 end of the day the milkman still has  
 to count up his books and load the van
 for the next day.It is a very hard    
 job.
