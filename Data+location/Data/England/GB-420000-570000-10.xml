		<title>10MORLEY HILL FARM</title>
		<content>{Morley Hill}farm was the first of     
 a number of farms which we surveyed.  
 Questions for the farmer were asked   
 concerning his land use etc. First    
 we ask how much{cultivated}he owned   
 which turned out to be 20 acres and   
 along with this 100 acres of grazing  
 land. The farmland we expected would  
 have woodland on it but surprisingly  
 it did not. From other questions we   
 found out that the farmer and         
 labourers worked from 8.00am to 5.00pm
 on his 120 acres of land.{Livestock}is
 also kept on the farm and a vast 100  
 acres is used for grazing cows, sheep,
 horses, hens and geese. From this     
 livestock, meat products are sold to  
 D&amp;G Haswell butchers but funny enough 
 the farmer does not slaughter his own 
 animals. The farmer also did not use  
{pesticides}and did not get any yield. 
 Crops of wheat and barley are grown.  </content>
