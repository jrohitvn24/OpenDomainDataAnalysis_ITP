		<title>10HARLESTON HALL</title>
		<content>  Harleston Hall is owned by the       
Phoenix family,and has been since 1919.
The family originally came from        
Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire and    
have always been farmers.They own a lot
of the surrounding farmland.           
  The Hall was built in the 1200's and 
served as a Manor House.It was refaced 
with plaster in 1832.The out-buildings 
were constructed in 1879.The buildings 
cover 2-3 acres of land surrounding the
Hall.                                  
  The farmland covers over 400 acres of
land altogether.This land is mainly    
used for arable farming.No fruit is    
grown on the farm,but there is a       
reasonably sized vegetable garden which
provides the families needs.           
  Apart from sending pigs to Haverhill 
the Phoenix brothers sell their corn to
customers in the East-Anglian region.  
Eggs and potatoes are also sold.       </content>
