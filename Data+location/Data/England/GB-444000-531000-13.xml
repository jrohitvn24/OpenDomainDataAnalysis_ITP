		<content> Next we go into the hall to have lunch
 at twelve o'clock. After that we have 
 half an hour break time. I usually    
 play football. We go back in for an   
 art or craft lesson, then another     
 break time. After that we come in for 
 art, literature or health education.  
 At half past three my Dad picks me up 
 and then we pick up my sister from    
 High-Tunstall school. When we get home
 I have my tea while watching the      
 television. After tea I play for half 
 an hour. Then I get ready for school  
 swimming club. After I have put my    
 towel and what I need in my bag I get 
 my coat on and my mam takes me to     
 swimming club. When I get home I have 
 a blancmange, which is a frozen food, 
 then I watch television and go to bed 
 at half past nine.
