		<title>05OAST THEATRE TONBRIDGE</title>
		<content>  The Oast is the second site for the  
 Tonbridge Theatre and Arts Club.The   
 first site was a room rented from the 
 Mitre Inn by the club.By the late 60's
 they had been going for 20 years and  
 they needed a larger property of their
 own.The Oast was found in ruins in    
 1969 and was suggested as a possible  
 new site.Many members saw its potent- 
 ial,particularly 7,who offered Â£1000  
 each provided a further Â£1500,necess- 
 ary for restoration,was found.The     
 money was raised and the Oast was     
 bought.Over 5 years the Oast was      
 restored and began to take shape as a 
 theatre.The members put many hours    
 into the Oast and on 20th April 1974  
 it was opened by Lady Abergavenny who 
 was standing in for the famous actress
 Edith Evans who was ill.Since then the
 theatre has grown in size and popular-
 ity and there are now 1200 members.   </content>
