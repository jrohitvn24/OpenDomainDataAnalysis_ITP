		<title>01RECREATION--LEEK GROWING--</title>
		<content> Leeks are usually sown under glass in 
 March, set out in the nursery in      
 April, and planted in prepared        
 trenches, in June or July.For success 
 rich soil is needed and it is common  
 on poor soil to open wide, deep       
 trenches and to fill in a five inch   
 layer of animal manure at the bottom. 
 As growth develops, the earth from the
 sides of the trenches is drawn up     
 against the plants with the result    
 that the lower portion of the leaves  
 become blanched. Good leeks for       
 ordinary purposes can be grown if a   
 wide hole is made for each by working 
 a dibber round in the soil refilling  
 the hole with rich soil so the surface
 is just a little lower than the       
 ground.Leeks are usually ready in late
 Autumn.
