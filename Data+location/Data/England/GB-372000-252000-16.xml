		<title>16HOBBIES AND INTERESTS</title>
		<content> Most hobbies and interests of children
 in this area take place at the        
 weekend.Reading is one of the most    
 popular hobbies, but living in the    
 country means travelling to a library.
 Most people travel to Malvern which is
 about five miles away, though a few   
 children wait for the mobile library  
 ro come to the village.Swimming is    
 another hobby which involves          
 travelling.Most people go to Lowerwick
 in Worcester, which is about 8 miles  
 away.                                 
  Two hobbies which are also popular   
 and easily done by children living in 
 the country are bird watching and     
 horse riding.Alot of children collect 
 things,such as postcards,stamps and   
 stickers,badges, rubbers and china    
 figures.                              
  Many interests are difficult to      
 follow because we don't live in towns.</content>
