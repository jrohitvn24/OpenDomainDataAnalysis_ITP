		<content> The  area lies to the north-west of   
 Dorchester and it consists mostly of  
 farmland. The combination of the chalk
 soil and the rivers flowing through it
 have given this area its chief        
 characteristics: grassy downland with 
 narrow valleys running through it.    
                                       
 The River Frome runs through the      
 southern part towards Dorchester.  The
 Frome has broken up into several      
 streams and formed some fascinating   
 meanders.  Running from north to      
 south, the River Cerne has created a  
 narrow valley.  Fishing is often      
 carried out in these rivers.          
                                       
 Over the hilly downland between these 
 rivers, there are several public paths
 which are popular with walkers and    
 ramblers.                             
                                       </content>
