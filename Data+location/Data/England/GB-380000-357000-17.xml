		<content> As can be seen from the               
 survey count                          
 there are very few shops in the area. 
 Because of this the majority of       
 families tend to do a bulk weekly shop
 in other places using Super or        
 Hypermarkets.The most popular areas   
 for this are Hanley, Kidsgrove, Talke 
 Pits,Alsager and Congleton.The local  
 shops however do manage to survive on 
 day to day selling day to day items.  
 There is great concern that there is  
 not a bank or building society in the 
 area.However with most people having  
 access to a car the travelling causes 
 them little hardship.
