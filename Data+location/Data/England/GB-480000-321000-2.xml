		<content> Barley is the main crop in the area.  
 It is harvested by combine-harvesters 
 in late June to July. After the crop  
 has been gathered in ,the stalks,     
 better know as straw, are baled. The  
 traditional rectangular bales are now 
 being replaced by much larger round   
 bales. The new form of bale, although 
 it cannot be handled by hand, is more 
 more convenient for transporting by   
 the large and powerful modern farm    
 equipment. They are however more      
 difficult to stack and tend to be     
 stored in long and low rows along     
 field boundaries. Rectangular bales   
 can be stacked and packed together    
 tightly, for example in barns.        
 When straw is not required it is burnt
 in the fields; this practice is       
 however becoming less acceptable and  
 uses for surplus straw are being      
 sought, for example as a fuel.        </content>
