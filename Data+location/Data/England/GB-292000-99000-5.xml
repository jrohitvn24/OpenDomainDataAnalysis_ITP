		<title>05FARMING</title>
		<content> In this block the farming concentrates
 on rearing livestock;cattle,sheep,and 
 pigs.Some farmers have dairy herds,{  
{FRIESIANS},but mostly the cattle are  
 reared for beef.The grazing land is   
 also used for sheep,the lambing season
 running from November until April.Pigs
 are kept in large modern buildings.   
 There is a large modern poultry farm  
 within the block.Modern farming       
 methods have led to the removal of    
 banks and hedgerows in order to allow 
 the use of large machinery.This is    
 particularly the case on the flat     
 valley floor.Here grass is grown for  
 silage,maize and root crops are grown 
 for fodder.Wheat is also grown as     
 a cash crop.There three orchards      
 within the block.
