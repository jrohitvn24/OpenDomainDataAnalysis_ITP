		<title>10Farming The Farmer's Day</title>
		<content>    On Friday l0th May l985 we went to 
 interview the farmer.   He told us    
 about his working day.   He said he   
 got up at half past six and started   
 work at half past seven.   He works l4
 hours most days.                      
    As he is an arable farmer his      
 busiest times were during harvest when
 he often had to work late into the    
 night to gather his crops.            
    Even so there were jobs to be done 
 on the farm all year round and these  
 include ploughing, sowing, rolling and
 spraying.  Sometimes he would have    
 done more than one hour's work before 
 breakfast.                            
    Part of his day has to be spent on 
 book_keeping, something he does during
 the afternoon or evening.   To help   
 him keep his accounts  and charts     
 up_to_ date he uses a computer.
