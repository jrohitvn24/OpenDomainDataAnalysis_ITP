		<title>10A Sunday With Jeremy.</title>
		<content>                                       
   On Sundays my family always tries to
stay in bed for some of the morning,   
usually until ten o'clock. When we do  
wake up we sometimes have a fried      
breakfast of bacon, fried bread, eggs  
and tomatoes.                          
   After breakfast my mum washes up the
plates while my dad cleans the car or  
cuts the grass. I clean my bicycle,    
tidy my room, play records or          
cassettes, just play in my room or go  
out to play with my friends. If nobody 
is about in the village I go to Marsh  
Gibbon, another village three          
kilometres away. I have a special      
friend there, and another who lives    
about a kilometre from Marsh Gibbon.   
   At about midday my mum starts to get
the dinner ready. A typical Sunday     
dinner for my family is chicken soup,  
chicken legs, roast potatoes &amp; peas.   </content>
