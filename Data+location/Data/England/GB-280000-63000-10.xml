		<title>10An Architect</title>
		<content> On the 14th June we went to see an    
 architect.  She works in an office in 
 her house.  We asked what the letters 
 after her name stood for and she said 
 she was a Member of the Society of    
 Architectural and Environmental       
 Consultants.  We looked at the sort of
 drawings she does and noticed that she
 put a lot of effort and detail into   
 them.  She designs houses and         
 conversions of barns and other        
 buildings into houses.  Her hobbies   
 were dress making, gardening and      
 jewelry making and she plays the organ
 in the village church.  She lives with
 her husband, a retired army officer,  
 in a 19th century house with lovely   
 views over the River Dart.  She hopes 
 to be able to go on with her work as  
 there is a good demand for her skills.
