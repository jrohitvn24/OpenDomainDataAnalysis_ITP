		<content>   Binley Fire Station was built in    
 1969. It began as part of the Coventry
 Brigade ,but was taken over by the    
 West Midlands in 1974. At the present 
 time there is one fire engine, a      
 Dennis R5, a rescue ladder, and a     
 hydraulic platform. Modern fire       
 engines are propelled by deisel fuel  
 and on average use 15 litres per day. 
   There are 28 firemen stationed at   
 Binley, working two shifts from       
 9.0- 18.00hrs. and 18.00-9.00hrs. Six 
 firemen turn out on a call. They sleep
 on site and their rest room has a T.V.
 and Video.  The only female workers on
 site are the cook and the two         
 cleaners.                             
   Three to four people are killed in  
 local fires every year.
