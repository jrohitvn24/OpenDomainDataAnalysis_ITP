terraced houses built for the miners   
and workers at the then iron foundry.  
 A small estate of council houses was  
built about 30 years ago and new houses
are under construction in Foundry      
Square.The River Trent runs through    
the village. The school which closed   
in 1983 after 104 years was called     
Trentside.                             
 An arm of the Caldon Canal was made   
into Norton Green and an iron foundry  
supplied the iron work for the Menai   
Suspension Bridge,completed in 1826.   
The foundry and mines no longer exist.
