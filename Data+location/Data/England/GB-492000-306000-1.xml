		<title>01General Description of Area</title>
		<content> The area covered by our survey lies on
 the busy A606 main road between       
 Stamford and Nottingham.              
 The land is gently undulating and is  
 dominated by a large earth dam built  
 between 1971 and 1975 to hold the     
 water of Europe's largest manmade     
 lake, Rutland Water. Large areas      
 around the water have been landscaped 
 providing facilities for walking,     
 riding  and cycling as well as fishing
 sailing and windsurfing on the water. 
 There are two villages in the area,   
 Empingham and Whitwell as well as a   
 number of scattered farms.  Both      
 villages have a mixture of well built 
 stone houses, converted barns, council
 houses and Empingham has a well laid  
 out estate of new properties and a    
 number of new "infilling" houses.
