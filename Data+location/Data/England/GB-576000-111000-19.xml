		<title>19Adult's Leisure Hollington</title>
		<content> Many adults travel outside our area to
 sports centres, clubs, cinema, theatre
 and dances; mostly within a few miles,
 which is easy with a car. We          
 questioned them and found they would  
 like more facilities around Hollington
 There are 5{local pubs}which have a   
 good trade (pint of beer 84p). 2 of   
 them have a pleasant garden and serve 
 many meals and snacks. Some pubs run  
 football and darts teams.             
{Hastings Golf Course}is at Beauport   
 Park. It is a full sized course (18   
 holes), set in beautiful scenery, and 
 is well used. There is a club house   
 serving drinks and meals. Nearby are  
 Beauport Riding Stables.{Beauport     
{Squash Club}attracts many people, this
 is a popular game. There are several  
 playing fields (eg.Harrow Lane, and   
 Crowhurst) where football and cricket 
 matches are played.                   </content>
