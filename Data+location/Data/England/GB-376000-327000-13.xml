		<content>{Adbaston } The 19 members of          
Adbaston's branch meet monthly to hear 
a speaker dealing with subjects such   
as social concern or a visit to the    
Holy Land. An annual social event      
raises money for Mother's Union        
Overseas and there is also a summer    
outing. The worldwide purpose of       
Mother's Union is to strengthen and    
preserve marriage and Christian family 
life; the group supports this ideal.   
19 children, aged from 3 months to 5   
years, attend the Mother's and         
Toddlers Playgroup meeting every       
Tuesday in the Knighton Family Social  
Club. Activities include painting,     
sand, playdough and stories. The group 
is financed by the mothers.
