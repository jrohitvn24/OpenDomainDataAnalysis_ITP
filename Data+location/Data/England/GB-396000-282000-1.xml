		<title>01Halesowen Landscape</title>
		<content>    Halesowen is a town of many        
 contrasts. It has rural,green belt,   
 industrial and residential areas.     
    The centre is sited in a valley.   
 Today it is a large shopping centre.  
 To the East and West sides are        
 residential areas with recreation     
 grounds and a variety of schools.     
    To the south are the rural and     
 green belt areas including farms, a   
 golf club, riding stables, and an     
 Athletics and Cycling club built on   
 the grounds of the famous Manor Abbey 
 Ruins.                                
    In contrast the industrial area    
 spreads across the North East side of 
 Halesowen, the main industry being the
 iron production and associated        
 products. However many of Halesowen's 
 old factories are now derelict.{
