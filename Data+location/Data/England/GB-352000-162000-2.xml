		<content>   My mum gets to the market at 9.00am.
 At that time there is a queue of      
 lorries as each driver waits to be    
 given a pen and lot numbers for his   
 animals - cows, pigs, sheep or calves.
 The buyers come from a long way, some 
 as far as Cornwall, so when my mum    
 gets there they are often in the      
 canteen having breakfast. They have   
 the main sales one after the other    
 because some people like to buy more  
 than one kind of animal. A good       
 auctioneer can sell very fast and when
 the buyers have bought their animals  
 they go to my mum to pay for them. She
 also has to give them the lot numbers 
 and ear numbers so that they can find 
 the animals in the pens later, and    
 take them home. Sometimes the animals 
 get muddled up but not very often. It 
 is very noisy and very busy and no-one
 has time to stop for dinner. cont(P10)</content>
