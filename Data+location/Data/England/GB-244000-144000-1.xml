		<content>     Mortehoe is an ancient parish     
 nestling in the hills beyond Morte    
 Point, a rocky headland jutting out   
 into the Bristol Channel, with        
 magnificent views towards Lundy Island
 and the Welsh coast.  The parish      
 includes Woolacombe, a three-mile     
 stretch of sands which today attracts 
 a great deal of tourist trade, and the
 village of Woolacombe has grown from  
 only a couple of farms at the         
 beginning of this century to a        
 thriving community which today tends  
 to overshadow its more traditional    
 neighbour.  There are, however,       
 several caravan sites around Mortehoe 
 which blend into the landscape yet    
 command extensive views of the rugged 
 coastline and rolling hills.  Whilst  
 tourism is important, farming is one  
 of the main occupations of the area.
