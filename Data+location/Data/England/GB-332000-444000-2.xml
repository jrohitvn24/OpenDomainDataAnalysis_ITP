		<content> The I.C.I. Hillhouse Site is 3 miles  
 long and 1.5 miles across at it's     
 widest point. It was originally       
 located here because of the vast      
 deposits of salt. The River Wyre was  
 also used for transport,cleaning and  
 cooling. It employs 1800 workers      
 of which 100_200 are women doing jobs 
 such as colour_matching and cleaning. 
 The rates of pay per annum are Â£4,000 
 ranging to Â£30,000, and although the  
 I.C.I. is constantly expanding,the    
 number of employees is declining. It  
 is a{CAPITAL INTENSIVE INDUSTRY }     
 costing Â£18 million per year in energy
 and Â£17 million in maintenance.Also   
 extremely expensive machinery is      
 needed. The final product is plastic, 
 basically of 2 types, P.V.C. and      
 P.T.F.E. This year I.C.I. has made    
 over Â£1 billion profit and is the     
 first British company to do so.       </content>
