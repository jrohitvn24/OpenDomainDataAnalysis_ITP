		<title>06THE M53 MOTORWAY IN PRENTON</title>
		<content>    This motorway links Liverpool to   
 Chester. It is also connected to the  
{M56}motorway at Ellesmere Port, which 
 leads to the{M6}motorway.             
    It caused a lot of problems to the 
 farmland whilst it was being built. A 
 bridge has been built over the        
 motorway to let Storeton Hall Farm    
 have access to its fields. The farm   
 has{520}acres of land now.{25}acres of
 land was lost to the motorway. The    
 motorway is helpful to the farmer to  
 get his crops to market quickly.      
    The farmer said that there had been
 drainage problems caused by the       
 motorway. When the soil was put back  
 in the fields it was poorer clay soil 
 and it has upset the natural drainage 
 pattern. This has made the fields     
 wetter to work with the farm          
 machinery.
