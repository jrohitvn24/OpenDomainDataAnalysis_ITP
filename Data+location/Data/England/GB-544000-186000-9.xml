		<title>09A Dagenham Local Newspaper</title>
		<content>    {A visit to the Dagenham Post      
 The{newspaper}is 61 years old and has 
 had different names in the past. Its  
 editor, John Clarke, has a team of 5  
 reporters, 4 photographers and 3      
 sports writers. His day starts at 8.15
 when he opens the post. This takes a  
 few hours because he has people coming
 to see him and the phone ringing all  
 the time. He had a meeting at 9.30    
 about the{free papers}that come       
 through the letter box. Because the   
 Dagenham Post costs 15p, there has    
 been a drop in sales. This week 29OOO 
 copies were sold. The main story this 
 week was the{murder}of a boy outside  
 Lautrec's Club after a fight. After   
 the meeting, he writes letters and    
 phones people about{advertisements.   
 They can cost Â£2OO. His day finishes  
 at about 1O.3Opm.       Jackie Deacon,
      Class 2, Chadwell Primary School.</content>
