		<content> Life in the country is a continual    
 round of activity, most people being  
 concerned with the maintenance of     
 buildings and care of animals in one  
 way or another. Most people keep dogs 
 and many keep cats as well. Many      
 members of the community are keen     
 gardeners. The soil is generally very 
 heavy but also very productive; the   
 climate is generally mild, so that    
 good crops of most vegetables are     
 obtainable. Many properties have      
 pleasant lawns and flower gardens.    
                                       
                                       
 This survey was completed by the      
 Bredwardine and Brobury Women's       
 Institute, using a BBC computer loaned
 by Broadlands C.P. School at Hereford,
 whose help is gratefully acknowledged.
