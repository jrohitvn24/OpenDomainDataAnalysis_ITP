		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION.</title>
		<content> The area is used for agriculture      
 with few amenities. Most farmland     
 supports the grazing of cattle and    
 sheep, the latter inhabiting the      
 rougher terrain. The Exmoor National  
 Park covers part of the area. The     
 Ralegh's Cross forest (a coniferous   
 plantation) is part of a large private
 estate covering a few thousand acres  
 of surrounding countryside.           
 The buildings consist of farmhouses   
 mainly, with a few abandoned          
 dwellings - evidence of rural         
 depopulation. The Brendon Hill        
 Methodist Chapel, built in 1861, still
 stands and the Ralegh's Cross Inn     
 proves a popular venue. The remains of
 a slipway, used for hauling iron ore  
 mined locally,can still be found.     
 Ancient monuments such as tumuli and  
 barrows still exist throughout the    
 area.                                 </content>
