		<title>05Pendomer: Farming 1</title>
		<content> Except for two areas of woodland, Pen 
 Wood and Coker Wood, the villages of  
 Pendomer and Halstock, and the        
 reservoir, the whole block is given   
 over to farming. Dairying is by far   
 the most important enterprise. There  
 are some ten or a dozen farms,        
 typically of between 200 and 400      
 acres, with perhaps 100 dairy cows on 
 average - Friesian cross - and on the 
 larger farms a Hereford cross bull.   
 These farms raise their own calves,   
 replacing the dairy herd from their   
 own stock and producing beef; the     
 smaller units sell the calves and buy 
 replacement heifers as necessary. Some
 have a few sheep in addition, either  
 raising lambs or, more probably,      
 over-wintering sheep from other areas.
 Some of the farm houses are old, but  
 with extensive modern farm buildings; 
 other farm houses are post-war.       </content>
