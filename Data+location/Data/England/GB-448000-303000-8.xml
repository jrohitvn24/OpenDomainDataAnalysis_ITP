		<title>08A Parent's Day In Kirby</title>
		<content>   I get up at approx. 7.20,wash,shave,
 eat a quick breakfast,and go to my    
 factory.At my factory I organise the  
 men and plan the work for the day.I   
 answer the telephone and speak to     
 customers.Occasionally I will help out
 on the machines, although I spend     
 most of my time organising the        
 business.I start work at 8.00am, have 
 half an hour for lunch and finish at  
 6.00pm.Sometimes I have to go on long 
 trips to get work from customers.     
                                       
      When I get home I eat my dinner  
 and then go to the new factory which I
 am building until 9.00pm.Some days I  
 go weight lifting and play tennis and 
 squash.Some days I take my wife out   
 for a meal.                           
      When I get home I have a shower  
 or bath and watch television or listen
 to some music.                        </content>
