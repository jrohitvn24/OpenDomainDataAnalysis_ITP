		<title>03THE RIVER MERSEY</title>
		<content>    The River Mersey is the natural    
 waterway through the town.            
     It was made navigable to          
 Manchester in 1721, but travel along  
 the river was always difficult and    
 canals were more important when the   
 region became industrialised.         
    The Bridgewater and Manchester Ship
 were important canals which connected 
 Manchester with the Mersey below      
 Warrington and passed close to the    
 town.                                 
    In recent years, the construction  
 of the M6 and M62 Motorways has       
 reduced traffic on the roads, railways
 and canals of the town.
