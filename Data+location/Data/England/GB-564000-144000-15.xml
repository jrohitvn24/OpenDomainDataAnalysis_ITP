and has only one fire engine.The       
engine  is called out to fires and     
other   emergencies in Paddock         
Wood,Five Oak Green,East Peckham,Capel 
and Yalding and the surrounding areas. 
The fire engine weighs over ten tons   
and can carry 1800 litres of water. The
firemen do not stay at the fire station
all day,nor do they sleep overnight.   
There are fourteen firemen and two     
junior firemen. There is a practice    
drill every Thursday. All the rooms in 
the fire station are on ground level.  
 hen a fireman says there is a'shout'  
When a fireman says there is a 'shout' 
he means there is a fire and all the   
firemen are quickly contacted. There   
should be six men attending a fire,but 
if only three men arrive they must go.
