 Bushmead Estate contains a group of   
 interesting buildings. The 1700       
 redbrick house, adjoining the         
 refectory, incorporates Priory        
 remains. The Coach House nearby, also 
 18th Century, is a former timbered    
 barn with redbrick infill. Most       
 unusual, is the Grotto, reputedly an  
 18th century Observatory, 3 storeyed, 
 with battlemented corner turrets, a   
 pyramid roof and a small flint grotto.

 public house "The Anchor", 2-room plan
 thatched cottages and a redbrick 18th 
 Century Dovecote with weatherboarded  
 lantern or glover.Staploe has a       
 weatherboarded 18th Century cottage in
