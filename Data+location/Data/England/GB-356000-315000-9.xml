		<title>09FAMILY HOLIDAY HIGH ERCALL</title>
		<content> I went to Wales on my Holiday. We     
 went to Cemes Bay and lots of other   
 beaches. On the way, by car we had a  
 breakfast picnic. When we got to our  
 holiday house we unpacked then went   
 to Cemes Bay. On Monday it was windy  
 and rainy, So we went to a light      
 house. On Thursday we went swimming.  
 Then on Saturday we went home. On the 
 way home we went to a Sea Zoo. Where  
 we saw lobsters, crabs, starfish, and 
 lots of different fish. I bought a    
 badge which said, "I was bitten by    
 Anglesey sea zoo".I had a nice time.
