		<title>09THE FISH KEEPER</title>
		<content>{ The Fish Keeper}                     
 The Test River, famous for its trout  
 and pure water, rises just outside    
 Overton and runs through the village. 
 Conservation of the fish is the job of
 a fish keeper (water bailiff). One of 
 these is Mr. Wolford. He cares for a  
 stretch of water five and a half miles
 long and two and a half feet deep. He 
 works in any weather, in the summer   
 from light until dark and at other    
 times from seven o'clock until four.  
 He and his wife also run a fish farm  
 with about a thousand fully grown     
 fish. Mrs. Wolford looks after four   
 thousand fish eggs at a time. Green   
 dyed fungicide is put into the river  
 to prevent fungi growing on the fish. 
 The water level is controlled by      
 sluices.
