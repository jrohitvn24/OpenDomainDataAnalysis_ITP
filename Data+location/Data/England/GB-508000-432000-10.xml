		<title>10 MY SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> My school day starts when I get up in 
 the morning about 7.25.I have to make 
 my own bed, then after that I get a   
 wash then I get dressed and comb my   
 hair.Then I get my breakfast, get my  
 school bag ready with all my school   
 equipment in it. Then I go to school  
 when I arrive at school we have       
 registration and then we go down to   
 assembly. After assembly we have two  
 lessons and then we have playtime and 
 after that we have two more lessons   
 followed by dinnertime.               
       Then after dinnertime we have   
 two more lessons, followed by another 
 playtimeand then finally the last two 
 lessons of the day we usually leave at
 4 o'clock                             
 unless we have a practice of          
 some sort.
