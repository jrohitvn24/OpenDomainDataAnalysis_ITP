		<title>13St.Lawrences Church.</title>
		<content>   Saint Lawrence's Church was built   
 in 1531.The present rector has been   
 rector for two years.The church is    
 black and white and is made of wood   
 and plaster.                          
   In 1872 the Victorions built an     
 extension at the front of the church. 
 It consisted of two transepts and a   
 chancel.They also put wooden supports 
 on the sides of the church. Recently  
 when work was being carried out on the
 roof it was found that these wooden   
 supports were rotting so they were    
 removed from the tower.This has left  
 that part of the church very much as  
 it was originally.                    
   The church was once called St.James'
 but a man called Mr.Gresswell changed 
 it's name to St. Lawrence's.He did so 
 because Denton Wakes fell on St.      
 Lawrence's Day.
