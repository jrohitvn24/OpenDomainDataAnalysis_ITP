 or in the newspaper. There are three  
 local newspapers.The{Tavistock Times  
 is out on Friday,the{Tavistock Gazette
 on a Wednesday,while the{Western      
{Morning News}is published every day   
 exept Sunday.                         
   Some issues reported affect people  
 in Horrabridge like the job loses at  
{Devonport Dockyard,}in Plymouth where 
 2,000 people will be made redundant.  
 Defence Secretary,{Michael Heseltine  
 decided to come down to see the       
 Dockyard.The Dockyard workers, some of
 whom come from Horrabridge staged a   
 peaceful sit down demonstration.      
   Quite often local people are        
 mentioned because they do something of
 interest, like the{Grenofen}Squash    
 professional who got to the finals of 
 the{National Squash Championships.
