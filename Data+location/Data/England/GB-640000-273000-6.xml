In 1757 the River Blyth Navigation was 
formed, and although only a small      
section of the river is within the     
survey area to the north-east, it also 
includes the Bramfield Brook which was 
navigable to wherries as far as a quay 
at Church Farm, Thorington. This was   
used for grain, hay and flints. There  
is no record of this being used after  
1810.                                  
The narrow guage Halesworth to         
Southwold Railway was opened in 1879   
and closed 50 years later.             
The roads were not metalled until after
the Great War of 1914-1918, and the    
minor roads remained under gravel until
1935.
