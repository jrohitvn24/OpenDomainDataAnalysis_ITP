 Our area lies 25 kilometers North-West
 of London.It is served both by the M1 
 motorway and rail-B.R. and the        
 Underground .                         
{Bushey Heath,}standing on a hill,and  
 once well known for its healthy air   
 and fine views,is now a respectable   
 residential area.Halfway down the     
 hill,{Bushey Village}retains some of  
 the 'old world'charm it had when      
 Herkomer and his school of painters   
 lived here.                           
 Across farmland to the South-West lies
{Carpenders Park},a post world war two 
 residential estate.                   
 Nearby{Watford},with its impressive   
 shopping centre and first division    
 football team,attracts people from a  
 wide area.
