{The Mill,}a brick and flint building  
 astride the river Till, a tributary of
 the river Wylye, was built by local   
 craftsmen in about 1810. An undershot 
 water wheel originally powered cake-  
 and root- cutting machinery and corn  
 grinding stones within the Mill, and  
 butter and cheese making machinery in 
 an adjoining house. Today, that same  
 wheel powers a pump drawing water from
 a 60-foot bore hole, and provides     
 water for an 800 acre farm. The       
 building is of three floors, the      
 ground floor housing the wheel and    
 associated hatches for controlling    
 water levels.                         
 On old maps the building is described 
 as the Bean Mill, suggesting that     
 pulses were grown for animal feeds.
