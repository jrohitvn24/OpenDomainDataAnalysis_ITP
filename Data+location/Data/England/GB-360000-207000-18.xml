		<title>18Forest Freeminers (Parkend)</title>
		<content> Coalmining was once one of the Forest 
 of Dean's most important              
 industries.Now only a small number of 
 mines are actually worked in the area 
 .Maps and information about all the   
 small mines in the Forest are kept in 
 the Deputy Gavellers  office in       
 Coleford.Anyone can apply to buy and  
 work a small mine but few people can  
 belong to an associatoin in the Forest
 called ,"The Freminers                
 Association".This is made up of a     
 group of men, all of whom have gained 
 the right to called freeminers.To     
 become a freeminer one must:(a) Be    
 male. (b) Have been born within   the 
 hundred of St.Briavels.(This is       
 specifficlly defied area within the   
 Forest of Dean).(c)Have worked in a   
  mine for one year and one day        
 Freemineing is one of the Forests     
 oldest traditions.                    </content>
