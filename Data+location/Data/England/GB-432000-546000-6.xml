 was extended by my dad. In the house  
 upstairs there are three bedrooms, two
 big ones and one small one which is   
 mine.                                 
      Also upstairs we have a bathroom

 itself. We have twenty one sockets in 
 our house and two in the garage.      
      We have eighteen lights in our   
 house. We have{ten doors.}Our house   
 was built by Pearson, a local builder 
 in 1972 or 1975. That is my house.
