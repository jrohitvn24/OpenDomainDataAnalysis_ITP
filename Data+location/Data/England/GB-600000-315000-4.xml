    This is primarily an area of       
 intensive, arable farming.   The land 
 is relatively flat and the soil light,
 making for highly mechanised farming. 
 Although many hedgerows have been     
 removed to increase field sizes, many 
 copses and tree-lined field boundaries
 remain.                               
                                       
    The three major crops grown are:-  
 barley, wheat and sugar beet.   Others
 include oil seed rape, peas, carrots, 
 beans and potatoes.                   
                                       
    The low lying land in the valley of
 the River Wensum has been recently    
 drained and is now used as pasture    
 land for beef and dairy cattle.
