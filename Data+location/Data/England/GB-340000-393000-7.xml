		<title>07A Visit to Croxteth Hall</title>
		<content>   {Croxteth Hall}is very big, very    
 nice and has lots of lovely things in-
 side.  There are patterned windows.   
 Inside are old-fashioned dresses,     
 tables and chairs from long ago.  Near
 the Hall there is a walled garden. The
 walls used to have heating inside them
 so peaches would grow there.  Now     
 it is a gardening centre where they   
 teach you how to plant things.  In the
 souvenir shop they sell various things
 including eggs from the hens at the   
 farm.  You can buy sweets, ice cream &amp;
 cold drinks.  On the farm they keep   
 horses, pigs, rabbits, hens, sheep    
 with curly horns and cows, but they   
 are mainly unusual breeds.  There is a
 horse riding centre and when you are  
 good at it they let you ride round the
 park by yourself.  When you are twelve
 you can work in the stables.
