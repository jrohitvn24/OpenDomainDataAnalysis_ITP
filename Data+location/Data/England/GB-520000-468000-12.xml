		<title>12FLAMBOROUGH SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Flamborough's first school was opened 
 in 1845. In 1974 our new school was   
 opened by Princess Margaret. The      
 square shaped hall is central. Off two
 sides are teaching areas which can be 
 closed off into two classrooms. The   
 kitchens and administrative block are 
 off a third side. Another teaching    
 area should have been built off the   
 fourth side but was not completed due 
 to lack of money and falling numbers. 
 We do have one mobile classroom in the
 grounds. At present there is a head   
 and four full time teachers. Class 1  
 is the infant class with 28 children; 
 Class 2 has 22 top infants and first  
 year junior children; Class 3 has 30  
 second and third years and Class 4 -  
 31 third and fourth years. We have a  
 small yard but a large playing field  
 surrounded by young trees.
