		<title>03RICHMOND HILL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Richmond Hill is a special school for 
 children with learning difficulties.  
 It was opened in 1961. There are 8    
 classes. We go to the Youth House     
 every Tuesday for our P.E. lesson. On 
 Thursday we go to Putteridge High     
 School for our swimming lessons. We   
 have Distar reading every morning with
 different teachers because there are  
 different stages in it. Boys and girls
 have cooking on certain days. Class 1 
 have a chance to do baby day every    
 Easter term. We get to hold the baby, 
 feed it, change the nappy and make a  
 meal for the mums. Mrs Miller is our  
 cooking teacher she cooks very well.  
 Mrs Payne does a computer lesson with 
 class 1 every Wednesday afternoon. The
 school has a large playing field and a
 new pond area with a hide to watch the
 wild life.                            
                                       </content>
