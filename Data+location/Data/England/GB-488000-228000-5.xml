		<content> We have found out which routes most   
 people who live in Great              
 Brickhill take to go to               
 work from the village. The most       
 popular route to work is towards      
 the A5 in the North then through the  
 nearest major town which is           
 Bletchley.The second most popular     
 route is towards the A5 through Little
 Brickhill. Next people travel towards 
 Leighton Buzzard past the Three       
 Locks. The next most popular route    
 is through Heath and Reach. When we   
 did our survey 92 people did not      
 reply  and we found 38 people         
 worked in Great Brickhill. 17 were not
 working and 60 had retired.
