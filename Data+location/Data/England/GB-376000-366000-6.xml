		<content> In the area there are four groups of  
 specialised accommodation for elderly 
 people.  These are situated in Picton 
 Square, London Road, Hermitage Drive  
 and Brookfield Drive.                 
 The Hermitage Flatlets were the first 
 to be built by Congleton Borough      
 Council.  They were opened on 23      
 October 1961.  The first tenants were 
 in residence on 11 November 1961.     
 There are 9 single flatlets, 3 double 
 ones and 5 bungalows.  All have a     
 means of contact with the warden in an
 emergency or with a central control in
 Congleton when the warden is not on   
 duty.  Nevertheless, each unit        
 provides an independent home.  There  
 are 18 tenants, 1 of whom lives with  
 her son.  There are 4 employees - the 
 warden, a domestic lady, and home help
 who cooks meals, and a bath nurse.    
 Dr. Hudson pays regular visits.       </content>
