		<content>   {The Norfolk Structure Plan}        
                                       
    Burnham Market has been designated 
 for major estate development and there
 is considerable concern here that such
 development will ruin the village.    
 There is no likelihood of further     
 council housing being built; all new  
 houses will be private developments   
 and are likely to be sold to people   
 moving into the area to retire. The   
 Norfolk Structure Plan is being       
 revised in 1985 to cover the period to
 1996. Proposals are being made to     
 Norfolk County Council that, whilst   
 limited development in this           
 outstandingly beautiful village is    
 desirable, Burnham Market should not  
 be designated for major estate        
 development. Whether the village      
 retains its character and beauty may  
 depend on this - time will tell.      </content>
