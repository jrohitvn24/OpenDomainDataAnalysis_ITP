		<content> The Forestry Commision (based at      
 Wareham) owns land at present their   
 policy for new planting is to         
 interplant conifers, mainly Norway    
 Spruce, with broad leafed trees -     
 usually beech or oak - accordig to    
 local soil conditions.  In thirty     
 yeards time, it is estimated that the 
 mature conifers can be felled, thus   
 leaving room for the broad-leafed     
 trees to develop fully.  The soil is  
 mostly chalk, with clay in places.  On
 greenhill down in Hilton Parish is a  
 nature Reserve administered by the    
 Dorset Naturalists Trust.  This is    
 sometimes grazed by cattle by         
 agreement with Delcombe Farm.  it is  
 rich in plants like dog violets and   
 birds fot trefoil which are food for  
 caterpillars and is a notable place   
 for butterflies.
