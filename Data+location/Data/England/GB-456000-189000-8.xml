		<title>08The Red Lion..Village Hall.</title>
		<content>{The Red Lion} is a very popular pub   
which has a thatched roof. The         
building is very old and has been      
standing there since the 14th century. 
The pub has two bars and serves beer   
and other drinks and also has a        
variety of food. Their busiest day is  
Saturday because most people have free 
time then. They have a barn to store   
the coolers to cool the beer. There is 
a small shop between the bars where    
they sell crisps, sweet drinks and     
cigarettes.                            
{Village Hall} The Brightwell Village  
Hall can be found on The Street. It    
used to be the school until the present
school building was erected. Many clubs
and societies meet in the village hall,
including the Playschool, Bingo club,  
Youth club, and clubs for senior       
citizens. Brightwell is  very active   
and much use is made of the Hall.      </content>
