		<title>17C.BURTON-POND/SHOP DIKE 1</title>
		<content> The shop referred to was a blacksmiths
 shop (shown on the 1920 OS). Obviously
 there would be a ready supply of water
 for the quenching of hot iron/steel   
 work.Although years ago the pond was  
 fed by springs this has nearly dried  
 up due to main drainage systems within
 the village's new estates.The springs 
 fed a number of amenity pumps in the  
 Main St.and  Highgate (2 still exist) 
 but the biggest loss to the village   
 scene was the removal of the village  
 pump.This was a grand and picturesque 
 structure at the eastern end of the   
 pond (the spring feeding it now lies  
 under the footpath).Unlike the others 
 the pond pump was made of wood,built  
 on a platform 5'above ground,reached  
 by a ladder.Atop this the pump rose 6'
 Horse drawn water carts took water to 
 outlying fields for the animals,a job 
 usually done by horselads or waggoners</content>
