		<title>08HOUSING DEVELOPMENT,DRAYTON</title>
		<content>     {The Drayton area}has seen a rapid
 housing expansion along the Fakenham  
 road out of{Norwich}in recent years,  
 the villages of{Hellesdon,Drayton}and 
{Taverham}now forming a near continuous
 ribbon development.Former fields and  
 forestry plantations have given way to
 houses,with the allied growth of shops
 and other amenities,although there are
 still enough fields for the area to   
 appear rural in places.Most of the    
 housing has taken the form of{estates 
 of detached  or semi-detached family  
 homes,mainly for those working in     
 Norwich.Suprisingly,the area has a{bus
{service}that is at best skeletal,the  
 majority of people using cars as their
 sole form of transport,which can lead 
 to serious road congestion at peak    
 times.There has been a slight increase
 in{local industry,}notably the        
 successful Carter building firm.      </content>
