{IN THE AREA SURVEYED,}THE LAND COVER  
 WAS PRIMARILY RESIDENTIAL.ABOUT HALF  
 OF THE HOUSES WERE OWNER-OCCUPIED AND 
 MOST OF THE REST WERE OWNED BY THE    
 COUNCIL.THE AGE OF THE HOUSES VARIED  
 ENORMOUSLY,FROM VICTORIAN TO POST-WAR.
 THE OLDER HOUSES WERE USUALLY LARGER  
 AND PRIVATELY OWNED,WHILE MANY OF THE 
 LATER  HOUSES WERE FOUND ON 11 COUNCIL
 DEVELOPMENTS.THE TYPE OF HOUSING IS   
 ALSO  QUITE MIXED.ALTHOUGH THERE ARE  
 NO TOWER BLOCKS IN MANSFIELD,PERHAPS  
 BECAUSE OF FEAR OF SUBSIDENCE,OR THE  
 LACK OF PRESSURE FOR NEW HOUSING,MOST 
 OTHER TYPES OF HOUSING WERE FOUND.    
 MORE SEMI-DETACHED HOUSES WERE FOUND  
 THAN ANY OTHER,CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY    
 TERRACED AND DETACHED HOUSES.
