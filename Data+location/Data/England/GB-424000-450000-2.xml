   Our area is not flat and does not   
 lend itself to arable farming.{Farming
{is mixed,}dairy cows,sheep and some   
 arable.                               
   Dairy herds of{Fresians }are milked 
 twice a day. The milk being collected 
 daily by bulk tanker and transported  
 to the dairy.  Farms in our area no   
 longer bottle and sell their own milk.
 Farms with no dairy herd, buy in beef 
 calves and fatten for market later.   
   Sheep are of the hardier breeds such
 as{Mashams.}Lambing is from middle to 
 late spring, the lambs being sold     
 September/October time, known locally 
 as the "back end".                    
   Hay,silage and straw are all        
 produced to provide winter fodder,this
 aspect of farming being completely    
 mechanised.
