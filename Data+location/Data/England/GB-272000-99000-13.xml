		<title>13THE UNIQUE BOW WATERWORKS</title>
		<content> Bow Waterworks is one of the few      
 independant water supplies in the     
 country.The ceremony of the opening of
 these Waterworks took place on the    
 19th April,1859.One main pipe feeds   
 50% of the village.The rest are on    
 South West Water.Mr.A.Jewell has been 
 looking after the waterworks by       
 putting in the chlorine for the last  
 twelve years .The water from the      
 natural springs is either pumped or   
 runs by gravity into two storage      
 tanks.The biggest tank is about 30ft  
 by 40ft.and is 5ft. deep.It holds     
 about 80,000 litres.No one knows how  
 big the other tank is  but it probably
 is 10x10x5ft deep.The main pump is one
 and a half horse power.It is electric 
 so it does not need cleaning.There is 
 also a spare pump in case of          
 emergencies.
