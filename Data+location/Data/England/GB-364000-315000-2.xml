		<content>  The Weald Moors were mosslands based 
 on glacial drift.The name Weald Moor  
 derives from wild or wooded moors as  
 these lowlands were formerly overgrown
 with deciduous vegetation such as     
 Alders and Willows. Coniferous        
 plantation and windbreak stands are   
 often found on higher,exposed ground  
 in the area. 3 soil samples were taken
 from contrasting points,grid          
 references as follows                 
 642179,61,666171,66,677161,54         
 They were analysed as follows:-sample 
 1 A fine silt clay containing little  
 humus,sample 2 A sandy silt loam with 
 a high clay content,containing more   
 coarse particles and humus than sample
 1.The higher concentration of large   
 particles and humus improve soil      
 texture,sample 3 Almost entirely humus
 with no appreciable mineral           
 content,typical of bog land.          </content>
