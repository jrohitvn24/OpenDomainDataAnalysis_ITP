		<content> Covering land at the top of High      
 Curley between Red Road and the M3 is 
 an area owned by the Ministry of      
 Defence which used to be known as the 
 Military Vehicle Experimental Establ- 
 ishment but which,under new government
 policies,has recently been renamed the
 Royal Armament Research &amp; Development 
 Establishment(R.A.R.D.E).On these     
 Bagshot Test Tracks,covering an area  
 of approximately six square kilometres
 military vehicles are tested and deve-
 loped by driving them through dense   
 heathland and along sandy tracks at   
 high speeds.Both this area of land and
 land on the other side of Red Road,   
 used by the Army for rifle and high-  
 explosive missle target practice,are  
 surrounded by danger signs.They are   
 classified as Restricted Areas by the 
 MoD and should not be entered by      
 members of the public.                </content>
