		<title>04SUSSEX COUNTY HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> The Royal Sussex County Hospital,     
 first opened in 1828 by Sir Thomas    
 Kemp, is now a centre for a wide range
 of general and specialised care. The  
 hospital has over 400 beds and employs
 about 1700 medical, nursing,          
 administrative and supporting staff,  
 both full and part time. The          
 Opthalmology Unit in the Hospital     
 cares for patients of all ages, there 
 are usually 30 beds in this section.  
 The Hospital also cares for catoracts;
 this is when the lens of the eye      
 becomes extremely cloudy and          
 eventually results in the lining of   
 the eye coming away. This unit also   
 cares for squints and does a drainage 
 operation on the eye to lower the     
 pressure. The nearest eye hospital is 
 Maidstone (Kent) and so people come   
 from all over Sussex to use the help  
 of this specialist unit.              </content>
