		<title>02Farming in New Thundersley</title>
		<content> The rural parts are almost entirely   
 mixed arable {farming.}The only       
 animals are on{small holdings}and are 
 horses and donkeys out to pasture or  
 free range chickens. There are some   
 riding stables.                       
 The {crops}grown are mainly hay and   
 cereals. There is a small amount of   
{"pick-your-own"}crops e.g.            
 strawberries. There are some small    
 holdings along the main and minor     
 roads, which tend to be rough pasture 
 for horses, fresh vegetables and eggs 
 etc., or non-farming use.             
 There are five large farms in the area
 but their land has been cut through by
 major roads, a railway, and the       
 National Grid transmission lines so   
 there are some areas which are scrub  
 and uncultivated land. There are two  
 small areas of woodland.
