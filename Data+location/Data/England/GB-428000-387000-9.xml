		<content>  From the survey of 50 people that we 
 did,the most popular Home Computer was
 the ZX Spectrum 48k,and most people   
 used their computer for games.Over    
 half the people we asked actually     
 owned a computer.44% of people asked  
 did not own a computer,32% owned      
 Sinclair Spectrums,4% owned a         
 Commodore,4% owned a Tandy,and 16%    
 owned a BBC Microcomputer.8% of the   
 people surveyed used their computers  
 for programming,and the 92% of the    
 people asked used their computer for  
 Software(Games).The people that said  
 that they did own a computer were     
 mostly teenagers.Out of the adults    
 asked,96% said that they did not own a
 computer,the 4% that said that they   
 did used theirs for business.Our      
 school (Myers Grove) has 18 BBC Micro 
 Computers with an Econet Network
