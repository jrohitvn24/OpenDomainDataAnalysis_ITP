		<title>14Frogmill as a Staging Inn</title>
		<content>    In October 1731 there was published
 an account of the journey of a London 
 Stage coach from Gloucester and so it 
 was that the Frogmill became the      
 first staging inn out of Gloucester.  
 Here passengers who had come by       
 post-chaise from Cheltenham joined the
 London coach. In 1756 the Gloucester  
 Flying machine made its first         
 journey to London in the record time  
 of two days. The Frogmill now became a
 busy inn with stabling for twenty     
 changes of horses and by the river was
 a smithy and over the stables a corn  
 loft. There was accommodation in the  
 inn for travellers and many meals were
 served while horses were being        
 hurriedly changed. There were many    
 famous coaches now calling there,     
 including The London Mail in 1785 and 
 The Regulator and The Tram O'Shanter.
