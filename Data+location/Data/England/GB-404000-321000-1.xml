		<title>01Review of Blithfield area</title>
		<content> Blithfield reservoir dominates this   
 rural area &amp; attracts many visitors.  
 its presence has resulted in the      
 formation of bird, sailing, angling   
 and sub-aqua clubs.  Agriculture is   
 the main industry with cttle, dairy   
 cows and sheep.  Places of residence  
 are few consisting of old farm houses,
 cottages and only 4 small groups of   
 houses at Admaston, Stockwell heath,  
 Seedcroft and part of Colton.         
 electricity and water are available   
 but no gas.  Mostly a septic tank or  
 cesspit is used.  The nearest shopping
 Ruvgeley &amp; Uttoxeter, there is no     
 public transport except buses for     
 school children.  The landscape is    
 attractive with many types of trees   
 and most fields heded, it is rich in  
 wild lie and  flora.
