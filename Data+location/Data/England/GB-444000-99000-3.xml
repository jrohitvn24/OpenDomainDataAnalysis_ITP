		<title>03CADLAND HOUSE.</title>
		<content>   Some 75% of the land in our project 
 area is owned by the Drummond family. 
 Mr. Maldwin Drummond lives at Cadland 
 House, roughly midway between Lepe and
 Calshot, overlooking the Solent and   
 the Isle of Wight.  The Drummond      
 family came to this area in{1772.}    
   The first Cadland House was built   
 overlooking Southampton Water where   
 the Esso Refinery now stands.  It was 
 designed by Henry Holland and its Park
 and grounds were planned by Capability
 Brown.                                
   The present Cadland House was       
 originally a fishing cottage.  It has 
 an interesting history including being
 burned down and rebuilt twice.  The   
 existing building was completed in    
{1935. }After the{2nd World War}when   
 Esso purchased and pulled down the    
 original house, the fishing cottage   
 inherited the name Cadland House.     </content>
