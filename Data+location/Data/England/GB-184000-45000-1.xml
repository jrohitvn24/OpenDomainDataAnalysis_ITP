 ,as even today farming is still a     
 thriving industry here.               
                                       
  It is a rural,picturesque area,with  
 beautiful views of the{River Fal}and  
 woodlands.Running through the area is 
 the main{London-Penzance}railway      
 and a road which is a main tourist    
 route leading into Truro.             
  The population is around{1,500}though
 it is a developing area so the        
 population is changing rapidly.It is a
 mixed farming area with some hilly and
 some flat ground.                     
  There are{3}schools (Infant Secondary
