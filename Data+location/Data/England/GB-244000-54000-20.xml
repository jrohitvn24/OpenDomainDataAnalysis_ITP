		<title>20RAILWAY LINES</title>
		<content> The Plymouth to Penzance railway line 
 runs right past our school. In fact   
 our teachers often have to stop       
 talking when a train goes past. Keyham
 Station is just 200 metres from the   
 school. Trains to and from Cornwall   
 and the Tamar Valley stop there to    
 allow Dockyard workers to travel to   
 and from work. The old Southern       
 Railway used to run through the area  
 but that is now disused. The present  
 track is the old Great Western track. 
 There are many old bridges, two big   
 viaducts and two tunnels in the area. 
 One bridge has loose planks which     
 vibrate when a train goes over; it is 
 known locally as 'Shaky Bridge'. A    
 disused tunnel which is blocked off   
 partway in is known as 'Darkies' Some 
 children play in there. One railway   
 line goes into the dockyard. People   
 say it is used for nuclear waste.     </content>
