		<title>15Changing Industry</title>
		<content> The original industry was located     
 along Bradshaw and Eagley Brooks using
 water power.There were bleachworks at 
 Bradshaw and Meeting o' the Waters,   
 a cotton mill at Eagley and a paper   
 mill at Hall ith Wood.The cotton mill 
 later changed to coal power.          
 Most of the Bradshaw works is no      
 longer in use whilst Eagley mill has  
 been divided up into units,having     
 closed as a cotton mill in the 1960's.
 Walmesley's paper mill is now found on
 the Meeting o' the Waters site.       
 Little other industry exists in the   
 area.A painting restoration firm have 
 taken over the old council offices at 
 Bromley Cross and a timber mill is    
 sited on the side of Bradshaw Brook.  
 Quarries of millstone grit,used as a  
 building stone, are found at Hardy    
 Mill but are now closed and are being 
 filled in as tips.                    </content>
