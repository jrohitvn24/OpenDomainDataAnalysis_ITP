		<title>03THE LES QUENNEVAIS AREA</title>
		<content>      The area where I live is the Les 
 Quennevais area. It is in the parish  
 of St. Brelade. There are lots of     
 things to do, most of my friends live 
 in this area. The school I go to is   
 in Les Quennevais estate which is     
 where I live and it only takes me a   
 few minutes to get there. There are   
 lots of of shops, clothes shops,      
 food shops, shoe shops, newsagents and
 others.                               
      There is a Community Centre which
 has a Youth club. I go to the Youth   
 club and Majorettes. Lots of visitors 
 and local people go to visit Belle Vue
 Pleasure Park, where they can ride on 
 go-karts, play in the Games Room and  
 use all the other amenities. There are
 playing fields and a cycle track,     
 which people use during the week. In  
 all, this is a nice area to live.
