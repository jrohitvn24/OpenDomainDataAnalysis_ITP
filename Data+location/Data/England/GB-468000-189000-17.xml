		<title>17Swyncombe embroidery group</title>
		<content>It is organised by the Vicar's wife who
is a member of the Embroiderers' Guild 
and a trained teacher of the subject.  
Approximately 8 people of all standards
do the work.  It is funded by the      
collection of pennies by many          
parishioners in St Botolphs pence      
boxes. The group is interdenominational
and meets at the rectory.  At present  
Falls for the pulpit and lectern are   
being made.  The fabrics used are      
silks from 1860 to modern man-made     
fibres.  Gold thread and kid are used  
as well as traditional materials.      
All the work is hand stitched and      
each person has their own work.  The   
completed pieces are then assembled    
into the finished article.
