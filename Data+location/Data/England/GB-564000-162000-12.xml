		<title>12HARVEL CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content>  The Harvel Cricket Club celebrated   
 its Centenary in 1972. Cricket has    
 been played on 3 different fields     
 within the village. The present site, 
 called the Desmond Wood Ground after a
 former President, is beside the Amazon
 and Tiger pub and was first used in   
 1928.  The club normally plays against
 local villages, but has had several   
 unusual opponents  such as The D'Oyley
 Carte Opera Company and the Israeli   
 National Team. Harvel fields 5 senior 
 and 2 junior teams, and there is a    
 weekly open night for youngsters      
 wishing to learn the game. On Saturday
 League Cricket is with us, and played 
 in a serious vein by the 1st X1. But  
 come Sunday,real  village cricket is  
 played in what must be one of the most
 beautiful settings in Kent. The Club's
 Committee is planning to purchase the 
 ground and construct a new pavilion.  </content>
