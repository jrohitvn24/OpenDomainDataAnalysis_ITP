 Barrow Hill is a village with few     
 shops.It grew next to the railway line
 to house the workers in the local     
 industries and collieries.The first   
 thing I noticed was that many of the  
 buildings were made of brick.There is 
 a brickworks in the village,causing   
 much traffic with lorries going to and
 fro.Staveley Works steel tube works is
 to the south of the village across the
 railway lines.There is a chemical     
 works to the south west of the village
 and the local farmers are looking for 
 telltale signs of pollution.In the    
 village I noticed one small play area.
