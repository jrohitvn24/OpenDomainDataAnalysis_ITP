		<title>01BACUP AND STACKSTEADS</title>
		<content> The area (or D-Block) covered in this 
 survey comprises of Stacksteads and   
 much of Bacup, and their environs,    
 which are within the area of North    
 East Lancashire known as Rossendale.  
 Situated on the western side of the   
 Pennines the area has much moorland   
 and the valleys are typified by       
 'ribbon' development. The population  
 of Stacksteads and Bacup expanded     
 rapidly during the Industrial         
 Revolution and much of the stone built
 terraced housing remains.             
 Along with other parts of Lancashire  
 this area suffered indusrial          
 depression with the decline of the    
 cotton industry, from which it has    
 never fully recovered. There are no   
 longer any working cotton mills, but  
 many of the factories now accommodate 
 the major industry, the manufacture of
 shoes and slippers.                   </content>
