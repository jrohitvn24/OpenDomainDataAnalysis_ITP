     the most popular site. This allows
 the members of the family to separate 
 and move to different rooms in order  
 to watch the programme of their       
 choice.                               
 This dispersal appears to have had    
 three effects.It allows youngsters to 
 watch relatively late into the        
 night.The privacy allows them also to 
 watch programmes on "unsuitable"      
 topics. Thirdly, it increasingly means
 that families only come together in   
 one room in order to view a programme 
 of common interest or for special     
 events such as meals or drinks.       
 Where families do view together, it   
 remains the adults who choose the     
 programme.Adults watch from armchairs 
 or settees but children tend to lie on
 the floor or have unusual seating     
 arrangements such as bean-bags.       </content>
