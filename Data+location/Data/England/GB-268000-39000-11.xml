		<title>11THE POUND, MALBOROUGH</title>
		<content>{The Pound}is by{Malborough Church.}It 
 is over{two  hundred years old.} The  
 pound was used to put{lost animals    
 in.It is made of stone.It is in the   
 shape of a square.It has four{holes}in
 the wall through which we think animal
 food was put so they could eat it.Some
 of the walls have been rebuilt.A sort 
 of {slate  slab}is over the holes to  
 stop the walls from falling into the  
 holes.  Now there is a{bench}in the   
 Pound where people sit and talk. Also 
 it has got grass growing  through the 
 cracks in the concrete. There is also 
 ivy growing on the walls.  The Pound  
 is not used for anything now. There   
 used to be a gate there but now there 
 are only the hinges left. There is a  
 big stone where the hinges used to be 
 attached.
