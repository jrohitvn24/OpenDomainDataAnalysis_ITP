		<title>17Home Life - a school girl</title>
		<content>    My name is{Amanda Flatt,}I am{12   
{years old}and I live at 8 School Road,
{Fritton.}There are four members in our
 family, my mother, father and my      
 brother who is 13. When I am not at   
 school I get up at various times      
 between 9.00am and 10.00am. When I get
 up I have a cup of tea and some       
 breakfast. At 11.00 I accompany my    
 father to a local shop. When we get   
 back we have dinner, then we sometimes
 go out to the nearby town of{Diss}or  
 we go out for pleasure to a zoo, a    
 nearby Otter Trust or a park. After   
 arriving back home we have tea between
 4.30 and 5.00. Then after tea we watch
 the television. Normally we go to bed 
 at 10.00, but sometimes we watch a    
 late night horror film, going to bed  
 later at about 12.30am after the film.
