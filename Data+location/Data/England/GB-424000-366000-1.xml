 This block lies at the south-western  
 edge of the Peak District National    
 Park.The River Derwent bisects the    
 block from North to South, joining the
 River Wye at Rowsley.The village of   
 Beeley lies in the centre of the      
 block.The villages are small, although
 Rowsley was an important railway      
 centre ,and the area is mostly open   
 countryside,consisting of high        
 moorland, forested hills, and the     
 lusher river valley.Tourism is very   
 important,since part of Chatsworth    
 Park, and some of the land belonging  
 to Haddon Hall is in this block.This, 
 together with the Derbyshire custom of
 well-dressing, and the unspoilt, hilly
 scenery, brings many summer visitors  
 to patronise the hotels and inns.
