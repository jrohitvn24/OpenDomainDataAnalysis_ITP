		<content> The landscape around Bishop Burton,   
 formed on Wolds chalk, is open and    
 undulating. Fields are traditionally  
 large, hedges are few and shelterbelts
 cluster around farm buildings and     
 in-bye land.                          
 In our block, the farms are large,    
 mainly{arable holdings with one

{sheep or less commonly, dairy).}Grange
 Farm has a beef unit alongside its    
 arable production, while Hill Farm    
 produces pigs as a secondary concern. 
 Sheep farming, a  traditional Wolds   
 industry has declined as farmers found
 more profit in converting suitable    
 grazing to arable crops.  The main    
 crops are wheat and barley, with the  
 necessary rotational break crops      
 being the relatively new and
