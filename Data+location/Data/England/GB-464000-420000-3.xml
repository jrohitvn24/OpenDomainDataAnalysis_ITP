		<content> Snaith is a small town situated next  
 to a major crossing point of the River
 Aire. It owes its early development to
 its position on routes linking the    
 Port of Goole and the industrial West 
 Riding.                               
 First developments were around St     
 Lawrence's Church. Agricultural links 
 can be inferred through the street    
 names, Beast Fair, Market Place,      
 Butt Lane.                            
 The centre of the town contains many  
 listed buildings, most notable of     
 which are the old 'LOCK UPS'. These   
 are presently under threat from       
 development. The Town Council however 
 wishes that the structure be          
 maintained and incorporated into a    
 wall of architectural interest.
