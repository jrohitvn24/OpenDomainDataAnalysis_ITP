		<title>17LONDON DOCKS</title>
		<content> London docks were set up as a port for
 Roman armies over 2,000 years ago.    
 Victoria Dock was opened in 1855 and  
 the others followed on. In 1981 the   
 largest docks were the Royal Victoria,
 Albert and King George V. But because 
 the water was not deep enough a new   
 port was built at Tilbury. When the   
 London Docks closed it meant that     
 there was a lot of people out of work 
 and unemployment struck the London    
 dockland. The area available is 1,000 
 acres of land and 235 acres of water. 
 In 1985 new houses, and airport and   
 many new enterprises are being built.
