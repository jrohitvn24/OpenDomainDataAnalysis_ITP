		<title>08Westering Primary School</title>
		<content> Westering County Primary is what we   
 call an open-plan school. There are no
 walls in our school and all the       
 classes are positioned on three sides 
 of a large rectangle with the kitchen,
 dining room and halls on the fourth   
 long side. If you stand in the north  
 west corner of the school you can see 
 six classes one way and four classes  
 the other way. The whole school is    
 very bright and cheerful looking, with
 attractive display boards, large areas
 of carpet, wet areas, quiet bays for  
 reading, an audio visual aids room for
 watching the television or films, a   
 music room where we can sing and play 
 musical instruments, library areas and
 two halls where we do gymnastics and  
 indoor games.  New children say they  
 find it very strange at first but soon
 find out how friendly and interesting 
 it is and then they like it very much.</content>
