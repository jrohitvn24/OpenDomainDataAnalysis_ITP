		<title>16DISUSED QUARRIES</title>
		<content> On our grid we have lots of disused   
 quarries.Many of them are over 100    
 years old with big trees and weeds    
 growing all over them.One we saw      
 looked like a small wood until we got 
 close to it and saw how deeply it was 
 cut into the ground.{Stubbs Quarry is 
{now used as a council rubbish dump.   
 Opened 7 years ago they handle{council
{dustbin lorries and 30 private lorries
{a day.Skips arrive from as far away as
{Leeds,Wetherby and Sheffield,}these   
 customers paying for their loads.There
 are 2 large skips in the entrance for 
 household and garden waste.           
 There are 5 employees at the dump with
 3 machines for compacting and covering
 the waste.                            
{It is planned for the dump to close in
{January 1986 and to re-open at another
{disused quarry nearby.
