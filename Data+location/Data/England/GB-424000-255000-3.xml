   The history of the family who       
founded the house can be traced back to
before the Conquest.                   
   The present house,on the site of an 
even older manor house,was begun by    
Thomas Lucy in 1551 when he inherited  
at the age of 19,and he was knighted   
for his work as Commissioner of Musters
in 1565.                               
   The house and the land is now owned 
by the National Trust(since 1945).     
   Internally,the House is Victorian,  
having been 'modernised' and enlarged  
in 1823 by George Hammond Lucy.        
   The letter to Richard Lucy,displayed
in the House,and signed by Oliver      
Cromwell,is a reminder of the proximity
to Edgehill.Before the battle,it is    
believed that both armies forded the   
Avon at Charlecote Park.
