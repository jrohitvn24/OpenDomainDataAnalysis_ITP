		<title>17INTERVIEW WITH LOCAL MAN</title>
		<content>  We received this interesting         
 information from Mr P E Jelks of      
 Havant,who has lived in this area     
 since he was 3 years old.             
  The main occupations of the people of
 Havant, Leigh Park, many years ago    
 were as farmers ,gamekeepers,servants 
 and kennel keepers on the local       
 estates.Leigh Park Estate was named   
 after Leigh Park House which is no    
 there,and most of Leigh Park fifty    
 years ago was woodland and pasture    
 areas.                                
  During and after the Second World War
 the population of Havant increased    
 dramatically,due to the fact that     
 other areas in Portsmouth were        
 evacuated because of major bombing.   
  Idsworth House and Estate now is the 
 image of what Leigh Park was like     
 before the housing estate was built.
