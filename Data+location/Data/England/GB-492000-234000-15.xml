 Then we might go to the swing park or 
 play in the garden. After tea I would 
 read.My little sister Julia goes down 
 with Daddy and has breakfast. Daddy   
 brings tea upstairs for Mummy and     
 Julia plays until Mummy has had       
 breakfast.  Daddy mows the lawn and   
 Julia plays with her dolls.After lunch
 Mummy does the ironing while Julia    
 plays outside.  {(Angela)}            
 Last Sunday I got up, went downstairs 
 got washed and dressed and had        
 breakfast.Then I fed the cat, dog and 
 guinea pigs. Then I rode my red bike  
 and when I went indoors I watched     
 television.Then Lisa came downstairs  
 and we went outside with Paul.
