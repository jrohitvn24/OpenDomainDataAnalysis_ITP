		<title>04Holbeach Bank Sea Bank</title>
		<content> The old sea bank goes through         
 Saracen's Head and Holbeach Bank.     
 It is called Roman Bank but it was    
 really built by the Saxons.The sea    
 bank was there in 1066,but it was     
 very difficult to find out exactly    
 when it was built.There was a saltern 
 outside the bank at Saracen's Head    
 before the Domesday Book was made.    
 The villagers tried to protect        
 themselves from the salt water by     
 building short walls but when there   
 was a very high tide the sea would    
 come round them.So the villages got   
 together and built a long bank out    
 of stones and mud.New banks were built
 later and the sea is now 10km away.   
 A road runs along a lot of the old    
 bank and we go along it every day when
 we come to school.
