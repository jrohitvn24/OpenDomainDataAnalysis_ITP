		<content> EXTRACTS OF VILLAGE LIFE BY{LISA      
{PEARCE,HELEN CORNISH,CARON GREENWOOD. 
 I live in{Summerhill Cresent}in{      
{Liverton.}It is a very quiet place.   
 We have vans that come around like the
 fruit and veg, the milk lady, the     
 bread man-all kinds of vans. I like   
 it because it is not busy and noisy.  
 I live in{Liverton Village.}We have a 
 village shop to get little bits of    
 food we have missed during the week.  
 You can never really get bored for on 
 Thursdays there is a childrens club   
 that all the children of the village  
 can go to. And for the Mums and Dads  
 there is bingo on Monday nights.      
 I live in{Liverton}and my nearest     
 super market is{Trago Mills.}My road  
 is very peaceful but Trago is going to
 build a new one near Benedicks Garage;
 that means our road is going to be    
 busy and dangerous.                   </content>
