		<content> Stixwould used to have a stone well in
 the middle of the village.The village 
 is famous for the ghost of a lady who 
 was crushed against an oak tree by her
 horse.In Stixwould there is a five    
 pole house which is a mud building    
 with five poles holding it up.There   
 was an ancient church,but this was    
 destroyed and it was many years before
 it was replaced by a new church.St.   
 Peter's Church has its own graveyard. 
 There is an abbey in Stixwould which  
 used to have a moat to defend itself. 
 In the moat there is a hill and on the
 hill is Halstead Hall.The River Witham
 flows near to Stixwould and there used
 to be a ferry across it at this point 
 and a railway station nearby,but both 
 ferry and railway line have now gone.
