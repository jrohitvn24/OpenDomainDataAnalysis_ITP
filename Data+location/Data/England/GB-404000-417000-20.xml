		<title>20A TYPICAL DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>      After assembly we go out to play.
 I play hide and seek with my friends  
 Cathy and Jeanette.                   
      When we go back to the classroom 
 we do some written work. Sometimes we 
 write a story and somtimes we do      
 comprehension.                        
     At 12.00 it is dinner time, the   
 people having school meals eat first, 
 then the people having sandwiches eat 
 theirs. I have sandwiches.            
     In the afternoon we go to Elland  
 Swimming Baths. a bus comes to collect
 us and take us to the baths. I have to
 do eight widths breast stroke and back
 stroke, then I practise floating.     
      When we get back to school Mrs.  
 Evans tells us a story. We go home at 
 3.40.                                 
      When I get home I watch T.V. and 
 at 5.20 I have my tea. Then I play out
 until bed time which is at 9.00.      </content>
