		<title>01LIFE AROUND LOWER HARDRES</title>
		<content> Lower Hardres Parish with a population
 of about 800 lies on the B2068 Hythe  
 road 5 kilometres south of Canterbury.
 To the east and north-east it adjoins 
 Chartham and Thanington Parishes.     
 The downland is a patchwork of farms  
 and orchards crossed by ancient       
 bridleways. The winding lanes are     
 narrow many bear an oak tree symbol   
 denoting a scenic route. In contrast  
 steel pylons carrying overhead power  
 lines interrupt the view. Nackington  
 church, is 11th century Lower Hardres 
 church, school and inn, 19th century. 
 Houses are a mixture of very old and  
 modern prestige. The area is          
 prosperous, inhabited by professionals
 working in Canterbury and London,     
 farmers and their employees and       
 retired people. They enjoy village    
 life, fear development closure of     
 school, loss of bus services.         </content>
