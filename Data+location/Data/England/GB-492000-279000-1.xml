		<title>01  Introduction to the Area</title>
		<content>                                       
  The area covered is in East          
Northamptonshire. It is to the north   
east of Kettering and the North West   
of Thrapston. It is very gently        
undulating at around 100 metres above  
sea level. It consists of open         
farmland and much of the farmland is   
covered with crops, the main one being 
wheat. There are some areas of         
woodland around the 12 km square area. 
The main area of woodland is Grafton   
Park Wood in the north. The two places 
of habitation are the villages of      
Grafton Underwood in the south west and
the smaller village of Slipton in the  
south east. Both are very quiet stone  
built villages. The area is crossed    
from north to south and from east to   
west by quiet country roads.
