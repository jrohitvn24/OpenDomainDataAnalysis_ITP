		<title>19Wild animals in Fulford</title>
		<content> The grey squirrel, which has become   
 very tame, is common in Fulford. It   
 eats fruit, berries, nuts, acorns and 
 seeds.It lives in a domed nest called 
 a dray. The fox started living in the 
 urban surroundings of Fulford after   
 myxomatosis struck British rabbits. It
 scavenges from dustbins and birdtables
 but in surrounding farmland it feeds  
 on mice, voles and small songbirds.   
 The fox's home,called an earth,has a  
 long tunnel with a chamber at the     
 end.Rabbits,having now recovered from 
 myxomatosis, are again common in the  
 area. They eat grass, dandelions,     
 groundsel, corn, beet and turnip.Their
 homes,divided into several different  
 tunneled chambers, are called warrens.
 The hedgehog thrives in Fulford       
 despite being frequently squashed by  
 cars. They eat beetles, slugs, worms  
 and snails and nest in hedge bottoms. </content>
