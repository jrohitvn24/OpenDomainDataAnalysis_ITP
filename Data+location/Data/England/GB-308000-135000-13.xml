		<content>      Stogumber Village centre is      
 listed under the{Preservation of      
{Historic Buildings Act.  }Many of the 
 cottages date from the 1600's and are 
 made of{cob with thatch roofs. } The  
 external walls are rendered for       
 protection and painted white.   The   
{Church}rises from the centre of these 
 houses.   "Swan Corner Cottage" is    
 reputed to have included in the       
 interior walls the original Village   
 wall.   This property has in its life 
 been a public house and is now a      
 private residence.   The original     
 Post Office was just a few doors up   
 the hill.                             
      Moving away from the Village     
 centre the houses become more modern -
{Victorian and then modern day.  }There
 is at present a new housing estate    
 being built on land next to the stream
 at the lower end of the Village.      </content>
