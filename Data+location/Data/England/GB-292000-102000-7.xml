    The game of Buckie has many        
 different names such as{123 in, Pompom
{123, Rin tin tin,  Touch Buckie, See  
{Buckie, and 999 in.}This is how we    
 play Buckie. You need a group of      
 people. One of them is chosen to be   
 Buckie and that person counts up to a 
 number that has been decided by the   
 group. While this person is counting  
 the others hide. If he sees you he    
 says "{Buckie 123 I see you}" and you 
 have to come out of hiding and help   
 find the others. If he has not seen   
 you and you get to the post you say   
 "{Buckie 123 all free}" and he is     
 Buckie again.
