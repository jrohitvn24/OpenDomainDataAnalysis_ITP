  I get up at about half past seven,   
 and eat my breakfast. I get washed    
 and dressed, then go to the dump with 
 my Dad, to throw away any rubbish. The
 dump is on Canvey, at Small Gains.    
 When we get back I usually play out in
 the garden for a while, until my      
 cousins come round. Then we go in the 
 paddling pool if it's sunny. About    
 lunch time we have a barbecue,        
 which my uncle cooks. For lunch we    
 have chiken,kebabs and sausages. After
 lunch we usually go back in the       
 paddling pool for a while. The        
 grown-ups sit in the garden,          
 talking. When it starts to get dark   
 and cold we go indoors and watch      
 television until it's time for my     
 cousins to go home. They live close   
 to me, so it doesn't take them long to
 get home. Then it's bedtime for me.   </content>
