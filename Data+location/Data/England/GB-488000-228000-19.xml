		<title>19Tyrells Manor, Stoke Hammond</title>
		<content> There is a manor in Stoke Hammond     
 which was built in 1703 as the{Tyrells
{Estate Manor House.}In 1978           
 Mrs.Triefus bought it with the farm   
 and 265 acres of land_3/4 of winter   
 wheat and the rest is rough grazing   
 for young cattle. The manor is a grade
 2  Queen Anne style house. It has 11  
 rooms and 3 larders. They have a      
 simming pool in the front garden now  
 turned into a fish pond. There are    
 many outer buildings. There is a      
 silage pit an old dairy and a couple  
 of dutch barns,17 stables and a long  
 barn and some workshops. There are 15 
 young heifers. Stoke Hammond is       
 vertually built around the manor,this 
 is probably because the person who    
 lived in the manor before Mrs.Triefus 
 sold 195 acres to some people who     
 built some houses on the land they    
 have bought from her.                 </content>
