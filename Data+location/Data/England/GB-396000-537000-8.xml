  In our area 80% of the people        
 work, one third of them in the Cement 
 Industry. Others  work in shops,      
 offices, agriculture, quarrying,      
 mining ,building,the council and steel
 industry. 20% are unemployed because  
 they can't find a job. Parents have to
 go to a job centre to see if there is 
 a job for them. When you leave school 
 it is very hard to get a job unless   
 you do a part-time job, like          
 delivering the papers every day. Most 
 people get payed weekly and some      
 people get payed monthly.             
  In stanhope 10% of the people are    
 part-time worker's. Most of part-time 
 worker's are women but some are men.  
 Some people have part-time jobs even  
 though they are still at school.They  
 deliver milk and deliver papers.      </content>
