		<content>  On sunday morning we stay in bed     
 until ten o'clock. My mother and      
 Father get up first.It takes about    
 half an hour to make our breakfast.   
 I am usually listening to the Archers 
 on the radio.Then I get up.Sometimes I
 have my breakfast in my pyjamas if I  
 am tired. My brother spends most of   
 the morning in bed. After breakfast I 
 feed the cat and dog. There is nothing
 on T.V which we like , so we go down  
 to the allotments. Mother usually     
 stays at home to do the cleaning. At  
 one o'clock we have our lunch which is
 usually beans or tomatoes on toast. If
 the weather is fine we go back to the 
 allotments until 6.00p.m. when we     
 have our supper.It is usually         
 something special like fish or chicken
 whith white wine or cider.After tea I 
 feed the cat and dog, and practice my 
 cornet. Then I watch the television.  </content>
