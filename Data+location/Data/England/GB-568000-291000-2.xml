		<title>02FARMING, NORTH WEST FELTWELL</title>
		<content>   To the North of Feltwell the chalk  
 subsoil provides a thin light soil    
 which grows cereal crops and sugar    
 beet with some potatoes. The farms are
 located in the village and are        
 generally in the hands of owner       
 occupiers, some of whose ancestors    
 have farmed in the village for several
 generations.                          
   To the West of the Cut off Channel  
 the soil is capable of growing a wide 
 variety of vegetable crops including  
 carrots, celery, and  green beans as  
 well as cereals,potatoes and beet. The
 latest technology and farming         
 methods have a strong hold in the     
 area which has only been in full      
 production since World War Two Here   
 farms are in the hands of large       
 partnerships, transfer of land taking 
 place as investments.
