		<title>19WINDMILL HILL FARM</title>
		<content> The farm is owned by Mr.Thurgarland   
 and is 140 acres in size. The land is 
 arable and they grow potatoes, barley,
 wheat and oil seed rape. They rotate  
 the crops into different fields every 
 year because crops take different     
 things from the soil and put different
 things back. The only animals they    
 have are family pets. They have the   
 following machinery 3 tractors, 1     
 combine harvester, 1 seed drill, 1    
 spray, 1 tillage spreader, 2          
 rotavators, potato lifters, spinners  
 and ridgers. They also have four corn 
 trailers and two small trailers. He   
 employs one man all the year round and
 during the potato harvest he will get 
 some women to help him and an extra   
 driver. During harvest time Gordon    
 helps him get the combines ready and  
 helps to harvest the grain. This is   
 sold to the local seed merchant.      </content>
