 Rise Farm in Sproatley is 185 years   
 old. Mr Strong has had the farm for 12
 years. His family has had it for 50   
 years.                                
 He gets up at 7.00 am. He has 800 pigs
 of his own. He has 6 boars and 160    
 sows. He sells 70 pigs a week.        
 He employs two helpers and has four   
 tractors. Wally is his favorite pig.  
 The sort of crop he has is barley,rape
 and wheat.                            
 The farm is near to the school and on 
 some mornings we can hear the sound   
 of the animals as Mr.Strong feeds     
 them.
