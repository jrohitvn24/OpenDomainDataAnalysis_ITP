		<title>02TRANSPORT (IN LEWKNOR)</title>
		<content>We have no public transport in our     
block. There is a bus, though, which is
run by Houses of Watlington.On Tuesdays
it comes through the villages from     
Watlington to Thame for the market and 
on Fridays it goes through to Chinnor. 
People catch it on the way back to     
Watlington to go to the doctor's       
surgery.                               
Most households have one car, sometimes
two but a lot of the older people      
don't. Bicycles are used quite a       
lot. There are hardly any motorcycles. 
ROADS- We have one main road, the B4009
which runs from Watlington to Chinnor. 
The other roads are mainly narrow,     
single track minor roads. We are very  
near to the M40.
