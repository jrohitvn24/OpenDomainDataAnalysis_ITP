		<title>17Shopping in Kidderminster 2</title>
		<content> People in Kidderminster do not always 
 do their shopping in the Town Centre. 
{Local shops}often provide enough      
 variety to cater for general          
 requirements. The new{Franche Co-op   
 supermarket,opened in 1984, makes food
 shopping in the north of Kidderminster
 easier. Smaller supermarkets are      
 situated in the{Ferndale}and{Marlpool}
 areas too. The{Comberton Hill}area,   
 near the station has a string of shops
 including a Post Office, a bakery, a  
 hardware shop as well as several      
 restaurants and take-away food shops. 
{Specialist shops}are also found away  
 from the Town Centre. There is a large
 music shop and a bookshop in the      
{Comberton Hill}area. The{Horsefair}has
 a record shop,fancy dress shop and a  
 pet shop, while fishing tackle, motor 
 parts and glasses can be bought at    
 other places in the Town.             </content>
