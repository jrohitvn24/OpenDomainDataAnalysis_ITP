		<content> Most small food shops have died out   
 leaving supermarkets to supply most   
 people, with the exception of small   
 health food shops, which have opened  
 to meet the growing demand for whole  
 foods, without the additives which are
 found in modern processed foods. These
 additives are thought to cause many   
 health problems. A whole new range of 
 convenience foods are available,      
 instant soups, puddings, and complete 
 meals, that only need the addition of 
 milk or water before cooking. Also    
 many other foods that are quick to    
 cook e.g. fish fingers and beefburgers
 are popular, only needing the minimum 
 cooking times. There are many labour  
 saving gadgets available,gas, electric
 and microwave cookers, the latter cook
 in minutes instead of hours. There are
 also electric mixers and liquidisers  
 for cakes and sauces.                 </content>
