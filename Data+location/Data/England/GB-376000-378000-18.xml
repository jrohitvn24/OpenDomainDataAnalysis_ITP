		<title>18THE ILFORD 'RAJAR' WORKS</title>
		<content>      The Rajar Works was built in 1903
 and in 1907 Rajar Ltd. was formed to  
 manufacture photographic films, plates
 and cameras.  In 1928 this company was
 absorbed by Ilford Ltd. of Essex.     
      In June 1980, Ilford Ltd.        
 announced that they were transferring 
 the centre of their operation from the
 town of Ilford to Mobberley.  Much new
 and extensive building work has taken 
 place to provide sites for the        
 production of monochrome photographic 
 materials, research centre,and        
 distribution, admin, and marketing    
 facilities.  Over 900 new jobs were   
 created on this site bringing the     
 workforce to a total of 1400.         
      The Â£38 million Ilford industrial
 site stretches back from Town Lane and
 spreads into the heart of Mobberley's 
 agricultural land.
