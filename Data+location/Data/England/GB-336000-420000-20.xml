STILL RETAINS A FAIRLY RURAL IDENTITY  
WITH A CLOSE COMMUNITY FEELING.        
 TYPICAL RECREATIONAL PURSUITS PEOPLE  
GO TO ARE BOWLING,THE NEARBY LEISURE   
LAKES,FOOTBALL,LOCAL BINGO AND SOCIAL  
CLUBS.FACILITIES IN LOCAL TOWNS ARE    
USED ALSO - SUCH AS PARKS AND GARDENS, 
SWIMMING POOLS,SQUASH CLUBS,ETC.       
 MOST FAMILIES HAVE A CAR ALTHOUGH BUS 
SERVICES ARE QUITE FREQUENT.WEEKENDS   
ARE OFTEN A TIME WHEN FAMILIES WITH    
CHILDREN DRIVE OUT TO PLACES SUCH AS   
THE LAKE DISTRICT.
