		<title>16THE KEELBY CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content> The Keelby Cricket Club has its own   
 pavilion and ground.The pavilion has a
 kitchen,changing rooms,toilets and    
 patio doors so the match can be       
 watched from inside.Every year the    
 club members put on a pantomime for   
 the public to raise money for         
 themselves.Last year they did "Alibaba
 and the Forty Thieves"and I liked the 
 utra violet light shining on the white
 knives and forks.I also liked the     
 pantomime of Dick Wittington,in the   
 sea scene the sea was cardboard being 
 pushed from side to side.The boat was 
 on rockers being rocked by the people 
 on it.They have parties for the adults
 and discos for the children.The Club  
 somtimes go's to Paris for week.Last  
 year they went to the Palace of       
 Versailles.After play refreshments are
 served inside.They also do fund       
 raising events for different charities</content>
