		<content> Kingsford Country Park lies about one 
 mile to the N.W.of Wolverley.         
      It was opened in 1971 and        
 comprises 200 acres of mixed woodland 
 and heath with numerous sandstone     
 outcrops forming caves and cliffs.    
      There is a variety of            
 recreational facilities including car 
 parks,toilets and picnic sites.       
      Waymarked walks are signposted   
 and there is a trail for              
 disabled people. Horse riding on      
 marked trails is also popular in the  
 park.                                 
      The park is owned and maintained 
 by the Hereford and Worcester local   
 authority who employ rangers to       
 supervise the site.
