		<title>08THE M5 MOTORWAY</title>
		<content>  The{M5}was built in the late 1960s   
 to relieve the congestion on the main 
 north/south road through the area, the
{A38}trunk road.The motorway has{three 
{lanes}in each direction and there is a
 large interchange with the{A40}London 
 to South Wales road.                  
  On Wednesday 10th July 1985 we did a 
 traffic survey from an over-bridge.The
 road seemed quite busy with 1 or 2    
 lanes usually full.During the 2 hours 
 of the survey approximately 1,200     
 vehicles per hour passed in each      
 direction.About 70% were cars and 30% 
 commercial vehicles.The number of cars
 increased rapidly at about 17.30 as   
 people went home from work.           
  Cars and lorries mostly travelled at 
 about 90 to 120 km.p.h..Driving  was  
 generally good but several cars and   
 lorries were driving very close.Some  
 cars stayed in the outside lane.      </content>
