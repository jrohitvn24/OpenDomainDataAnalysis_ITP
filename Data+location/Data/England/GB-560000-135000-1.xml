		<content> When I went to Bells Yew Green all I  
 could see was some fields with{crops  
 and some of it was{woodland}and a     
{small village}with a tiny chapel and  
 post office with a foodshop. Across   
 the road is a pub and further on is   
 Frant Station.  It is a peaceful spot.
 Our area is covered with forests      
 mainly of{deciduous trees,}although   
 there are some conifers.  There       
 are also acres of{fields}covering the 
 area.  There are lots of woods near   
 it, about twenty of them.  In Bells   
 Yew Green there is a{tannery, kennels,
{golf course, a cricket ground and a   
{greenhouse manufacturer.} Bells Yew   
 Green is the{main centre}of activity  
 in the area and has the most housing. 
 Other habitation is mainly individual 
{farm}houses, tile-hung or weather-    
 boarded with attached{oasts}typical of
 the district.                         </content>
