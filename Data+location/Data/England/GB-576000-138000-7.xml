(cont.)                                
                                       
  There are not many houses,but the    
ones present are relatively big and    
quite old.No drastic changes have      
occured,although a large building and  
two new stables have been erected.     
                                       
  Mrs Nuttal says that most people in  
the low-populated belong to the Church 
of England.She also states that she    
likes the area very much because it is 
peaceful (only a few cars travel down  
the windy lanes.)                      
   There is no real history in this    
area although Mrs.Nuttal says that     
there is evidence of an old track which
runs through the fields.
