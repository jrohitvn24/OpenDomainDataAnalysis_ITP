		<content> We are served by 12 post offices in   
 our densely populated area of (South) 
 Sunderland.11 of these are sub. P.O.  
 situated in a main thoroughfare of the
 town centre's pedestrian precinct.The 
 public have made many requests for an 
 improved queueing service system in   
 most P.O.We consider that sub.P.O. are
 distributed evenly throught our area. 
 We calculated that the greatest       
 distance anyone has to travel from    
 home to a P.O. to be 800m.We are      
 served by 35 Post Boxes.We consider   
 these to have an even spread of       
 distribution.There is a letter/parcel 
 sorting office in the town centre     
 which is situated 400m from the town's
 Railway Station.The present telephone 
 Nos/code for the N.E. are at present  
 being converted to the prefix 091.
