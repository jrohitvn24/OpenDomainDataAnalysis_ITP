		<title>05Ramsden Telephone Exchange</title>
		<content>Ramsden Telephone Exchange looks like  
public toilets because it is just a hut
with windows. The workman let us go    
into the  exchange to look around.     
Inside the air smelt of toothpaste.    
He showed us the wires. There was a    
line of numbers. He dialled the        
telephone exchange number "86". The    
eight and then six went on to the line 
of numbers. When the numbers moved they
made a funny noise. He lifted the      
receiver and the noise stopped.        
It works by step by step switching.Each
call travels through a series of       
switches containing a vertical rod with
a horizontal contact arm. Magnets move 
the arm up and down a vertical rod of  
terminals which rotates horizontally.  
When you dial the arm moves to a       
terminal. When it touches the terminal 
the number is connected.
