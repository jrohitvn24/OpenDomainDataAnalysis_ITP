		<title>18The Midsummer Eve Bonfire</title>
		<content>    Originally this was a pagan custom 
 in honour of the sun, sometimes with  
 human or animal sacrifices. Nowadays  
 it is on the eve of St.John and is    
 supposed to drive away bad luck and   
 to bring good luck.                   
    In St.Cleer the fire was crowned   
 with a witch's hat and broomstick, and
 a sickle with a handle of new oak was 
 thrown into the flames, to drive away 
 witches. Herbs that are supposed to   
 have good and bad influences are tied 
 with coloured ribbons and thrown into 
 the fire. Some of the 'good' herbs are
 elder, fennel, larkspur and  sage.    
 'Bad' herbs include brambles,thistles,
 dock, nettles, cinquefoil and mayweed.
    People dance and sing around the   
 fire and will leap over the dying     
 flames for good luck. Good luck will  
 also come if you keep some of the     
 ashes in your home until the next year</content>
