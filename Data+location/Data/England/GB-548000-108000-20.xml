		<title>20Trade in Ripe.</title>
		<content>      Adjacent to the General Stores in
 the centre of Ripe is the butchers    
 shop. It is run as a family butchers  
 by Mr. Alan Priest who has only       
 recently taken it on. A large         
 selection of quality meat is sold.    
 Deliveries are made daily to local    
 residents including Deanland Wood     
 Caravan Site. Local Public houses and 
 restaurants are also supplied.        
      Opposite to the shops in the     
 centre of Ripe is The Lamb Inn. This  
 quiet country pub has two licensees,  
 Mr. Robert Robinson and his wife Anne.
 There are two bars and a restaurant   
 area, a childrens room and a garden.  
 It is a free house and the beer is    
 excellent. Meals are cooked in the    
 kitchen and served either as bar      
 snacks or in the restaurant area. Quiz
 nights are held every Tuesday and pub 
 games are making a comeback.          </content>
