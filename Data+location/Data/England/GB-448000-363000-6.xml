		<content> The young housewife informed us that  
 for the young ie below teenagers,     
 there is an after school club where   
 the children can play games. There is 
 a Youth Club held in  the chapel where
 discos are held regularly about three 
 times per week.The nearest centre for 
 the teenagers entertainment is in     
 Mansfield where disco and ballroom    
 dancing take place. There is a ladies 
 keep fit club in the disused chapel on
 Tuesday afternoons. There is a move by
 Mansfield Council to encourage clubs  
 and leisure activities in the area.   
 During the summer holiday at the park 
 there is an employed leader who       
 organises the children to play games. 
 There is a centre at the local primary
 school for the young in the early     
 evenings where organised games are    
 played.The village has its own Jazz   
 Band which competes during the summer.</content>
