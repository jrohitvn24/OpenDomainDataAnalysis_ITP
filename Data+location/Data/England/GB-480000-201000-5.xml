		<title>05WEATHER REPORT - RISBOROUGH</title>
		<content>The first six months of 1985 gave us   
our usual mixture of weather. We have  
h d the wettest summer equinox for 25  
years, 11 consecutive saturdays with   
unpleasant weather, a blizzard in the  
middle of January, snow at first day of
spring and a heavy hail storm in early 
june. However there have been better   
days.A warm may day bank holiday, a day
with cloudless skies and 13 hours of   
sunshine in April, and several days    
with beautiful sunsets coloured by dust
from the Sahara. The whole of the week 
after the late spring bank holiday was 
wm, dry and sunny, bringing us to      
flaming June; it did'nt last long, by  
the 7th the maximum temperature fell to
9c and by the end of the month it was  
to become one of the wettest junes on  
record. Where would we be without our  
englist weather!.
