		<content>  ECOLOGY:Nature Reserve:How it began  
    In 1981,an unemployed,unskilled    
 labourer,Barry Jackson,spent many     
 hours rod fishing from the revetment  
 of Royal Seaforth Dock.He began to    
 notice the variety of plants,insects  
 and birds that were "adopting" the    
 site.With expert advice,Jackson built 
 up a dossier of all the species and   
 contacted his local Job Centre.The    
 Manpower   Services Commission with   
 the assistance of Merseyside          
 Improvement Ltd.,gave Jackson Â£100,000
 and 10 men to create a nature reserve.
 The two pools were cleared of rubbish,
 rusting metal and oil.Large mounds of 
 rubbish were broken down to form      
 smaller hummocks.In 1982 Jackson      
 received two awards from the          
 Conservation Foundation and in 1985   
 the reserve received official status  
 with Lancs Trust for Nat.Conservation.</content>
