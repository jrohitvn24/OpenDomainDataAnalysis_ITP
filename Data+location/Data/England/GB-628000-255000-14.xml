		<title>14EDUCATION WICKHAM MKT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>School is divided into different       
things. Some are lessons, others       
playtimes. At playtime you can do lots 
of things like play football or run    
around. You can also stay in if you    
want to do some work. There is dinner  
time when you can have hot dinners     
cooked in the school kitchens or a     
packed lunch which you bring from home.
The lessons might be language or maths 
which we do from textbooks or on the   
board. We also have handwriting and    
project work where we sometimes watch  
television and do things like this     
project. Last but not least we have    
games where we learn how to play       
rounders, cricket and football. Sarah  
likes maths where she learns addition, 
subtraction, tables and fractions. She 
is learning to join up her letters in  
handwriting. In topic work we have     
learn about Arabs, eskimos and India.  </content>
