		<title>16INDUSTRY 2 - COLYTON Tannery</title>
		<content> The Colyton Tannery is one of only two
 tanneries left in England that use the
 traditional oak bark tanning method   
 rather than modern methods using      
 chemicals such as chrome. Leather has 
 to be tanned because an ordinary hide 
 contains about 70% water and would    
 become brittle if it was just allowed 
 to dry out. Colyton Tannery uses about
 30 tons of oak bark each year at an   
 average price of Â£30 per ton. Most of 
 its supply comes from the Forest of   
 Dean. The bark is shredded by machine 
 and placed in pits of clean water to  
 release the tannin.  This mixture     
 is known as a liquor. For extra hard  
 leather, Turkish Red Oak acorns are   
 used as these contain more tannin.    
 When hides arrive, they are cut up and
 placed in clean water for a while and 
 then into the first liquor pit.
