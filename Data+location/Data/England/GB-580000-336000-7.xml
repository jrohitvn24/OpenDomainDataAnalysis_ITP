		<content> The Stanhoe &amp; Barwick Social Club     
 arranges events in the village        
 throughout the year.  Dances are held 
 monthly and enjoy good attendances as 
 to the whist drives held fortnightly  
 through the winter.  The Village Hall 
 is L-shaped with a dance floor and a  
 carpeted area, a kitchen with its     
 cooker and there is a well stocked    
 bar.  Games include a pool table,     
 indoor bowls, darts and a fruit       
 machine all available for members on  
 Club evenings.  Happily there have    
 never been problems in this lightly   
 policed area.  In the summer Club     
 committee members organise            
 fund-raising events, this year holding
 a fete on the small playing field,    
 with stalls, games and a five-a-side  
 football tournament for the local     
 under 16's.
