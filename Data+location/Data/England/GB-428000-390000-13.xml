 ASKED ALL THE{SHOPKEEPERS}IN OUR      
 AREA IF THEY WOULD ANSWER SOME        
 QUESTIONS,THREE WERE UNABLE TO ANSWER 
 THEM. THESE ARE SOME OF THE FACTS,    
 HARDLY ANY OF THE TRADERS HAD LIVED IN
 THE AREA ALL THEIR LIFES.THERE IS     
 NOT MUCH LOCAL{COMPETITION}BUT THE    
 LARGE SHOPPING AREA IN HILLSBROUGH    
 DOES SERVE MOST PEOPLES{NEEDS.}THE    
 SHOPS OPEN FROM ABOUT 9.00 AM TO 5.00 
 PM. MOST PEOPLE LIKED CHILDREN IN     
 THEIR SHOP PROVIDING THEY BEHAVE. THE 
 LOCAL SHOPS ARE MAINLY USED FOR THINGS
 PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN.
