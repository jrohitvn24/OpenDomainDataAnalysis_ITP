		<title>02BARNARDISTON HALL</title>
		<content>  Barnardiston Hall has the same name  
 as the first owners, who lived at     
 nearby Kedington. Samuel Barnardiston 
 was the first to be called "Roundhead"
 during the Civil War. Before the Hall 
 was built there was a manor-type      
 farmhouse on a nearby site. The Hall  
 is moated and in the grounds is a barn
 (1854) with a slate roof. The present 
 Hall was built in 1897 by Lord Malcolm
 of Portalloch who only lived for a    
 year after its completion. His widow  
 lived alone here after his death and  
 had stables built to house old horses.
 In 1927 the Hall became part of the   
 Thurlow Estates owned by Charles      
 Ryder. The Estate was bought by R. A. 
 Vestey in 1942. The Hall and 16 acres 
 were bought by Mrs. S.A.Kiddy in July 
 1969 and became a school in January   
 1970.
