		<title>10Changes in Welham Green.</title>
		<content> A local resident remembers the Welham 
 Green of 30 years ago as having one   
 village shop-cum-post office.Today    
 there is a parade of shops and the    
 village has grown five times in size. 
 The development began in the fifties  
 with the building of a housing estate.
 It has continued to grow ever since.  
 Welham Green is the largest industrial
 village in Britain. The industrial    
 complex stretches along the railway.  
 One site (now a timber yard) was used 
 as a First World War POW camp.        
 Local clubs include:Albion Football   
 Club, North Mymms Cricket, Tennis and 
 Bowls Clubs and a Working Men's Club. 
 Behind the St. Thomas More Church, the
 community centre is a base for a wide 
 variety of activities for all age     
 groups and the village hall is usually
 fully booked.                         
                                       </content>
