		<title>01Landscape of Grafham Water.</title>
		<content>{  Grafham Water,}a reservoir built in 
 the 1960's, completely dominates this 
 block. Its western shore is bounded by
 a{nature reserve}which extends to the 
 northern shore. On the southern shore 
 there is a{fishing lodge} and the     
{Grafham Water Sailing Club}has        
 been established. Next door to the    
 sailing club is the {Residential      
{Centre}run by the Cambridgeshire      
 Education Authority.                  
   The village of {West Perry}lies on  
 the southern shore.                   
   The shoreline of the reservoir has  
 three {car parks}and a 100 acres of   
{picnic area.}                         
   On the north east shore lies the    
 Village of {Grafham}which is mostly   
 outside the block.                    
   The remaining land cover is given   
 over to {farming, scrubland }and{     
{forestry.}                            </content>
