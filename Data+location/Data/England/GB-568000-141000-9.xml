 Great Old Hay                         
 This name is believed to have been    
 derived from the word haeg meaning    
 hedges                                
 Old Hay as it is now called was known 
 as Haya in 1226 and at one time       
 covered 275 acres                     
 Castle Hill                           
 This was an iron field developed by   
 the Romans who built roads to serve it
 besides maintaining and improving a   
 number of the earlier prehistoric     
 tracks                                
 Castle Hill Camp which is the ruin at 
 the rear of the Castle Public House   
 was constructed to guard the approach 
 to the Tonbridge fords on an important
 track                                 
 Castle Hill normally denotes an old or
 ancient camp site                     
                                       </content>
