 In the area there are 62 houses, 7    
 farms and a hospital.There are 44     
 private houses of which 23 are new,   
 and 18  council houses. The old       
 school, which closed in 1976, has been
 made into a private house.Burton House
 farm was built in 1610. It is no      
 longer a dairy farm but has been      
 divided into two homes.One house is   
 said to be haunted by the ghost of a  
 girl who died of a broken heart in    
 1870.  She planned to run away with   
 a soldier but was locked away in her  
 room by her parents. Before she died  
 she wrote " Fond is love they here do 
 not leave me alay" on the window with 
 her diamond ring. The newest house in 
 the village is being built from old   
 materials.
