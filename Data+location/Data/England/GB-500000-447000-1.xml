		<title>01The Beswick Area</title>
		<content> The village of{Beswick}is situated    
 on the A164 midway between the towns  
 of Beverley and Driffield. The main   
 road at one time ran through the      
 village but about 1966 a new          
 section of road was built to by-pass  
 the village.                          
 The area under survey extends to the  
 north and east of the village of      
{Lockington,}reaching the most         
 southerly parts of the village of     
{Watton.}The A164 and the              
 Hull-Bridlington railway line, both   
 running north-south, divide the area  
 roughly into thirds vertically.       
{Beswick}village is the main centre of 
 habitation within this survey region. 
 There are very minor communities at   
 Kilnwick Lodges and at the southern   
 extremes of Watton. Other than these, 
 the only remaining dwellings are      
 isolated farmsteads.                  </content>
