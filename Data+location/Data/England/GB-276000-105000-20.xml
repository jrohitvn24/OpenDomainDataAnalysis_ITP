		<content> Although the village lies on the route
 of the old turnpike road from Exeter  
 to Barnstaple,it is now 2.5 miles from
 the new main road,built in the valley 
 in the 19th century.Milestones are    
 still in place along the road.The only
 public transport now is that run by a 
 local coach company.This is a weekly  
 bus to Crediton and 1 to Exeter.'Devon
 General',having closed their twice    
 daily service several years ago. Local
 coaches also take children to schools 
 in Chulmleigh and Crediton,starting   
 collection at 7.30a.m..Almost everyone
 has a car or van as many houses and   
 farms are scattered,some down narrow  
 lanes.Few use bicycles as it so hilly 
 and the elderly find walking more     
 difficult,so often rely on lifts from 
 friends.The nearly rail station is 2.5
 miles away and is little used.
