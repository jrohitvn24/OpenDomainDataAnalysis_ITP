 West Ipswich to Cardiff route.In 1978 
 it was made clear in the Government   
 Atkin Inquiry that the route would    
 join the M11 to the M1 via Stevenage  
 A1M and Oxford crossing the A505      
 (Luton-Hitchin road).                 
 The first phase - Wymondley by-pass - 
 is due to start in March 1986;the     
 second phase is due to begin in 1990 -
 Ashbrook to Offley.                   
 The St.Ippolyts and Gosmore           
 Preservation are trying to have this  
 road diverted so as to avoid splitting
 St.Ippolyts and Gosmore in two.       
 HOUSING: Several acres of formerly    
 green belt land in London Road,St.    
 Ippolyts were released (after much    
 local protest) for building.Planning  
 permission was given for up to 200    
 homes.This was in 1982.Building has   
 not yet commenced.                    </content>
