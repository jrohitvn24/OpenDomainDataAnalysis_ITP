		<title>13SEWAGE WORKS</title>
		<content> The{sewage works}are looked after by  
 the{Council.}The{sewage}which comes   
 from the near by town of{Guisbrough,  
 runs down a pipe, gets cleaned, before
 it runs down to the{sea}off the coast 
 of{Redcar.}There was a clean{stream   
 which we crossed. On the other side   
 there was a field of wheat.We passed 2
 farms{Woodhouse Farm}and{Park Farm.   
 There was{wheat, barley and oil seed  
{rape}growing in the fields. Going up  
 towards{Park Wood}we saw a{dismantled 
{railway.}You could tell it was        
 dismantled because there were tracks, 
 then grass in the middle. We walked up
 into the{woodland}which was{mixed     
 coniferous and deciduos. Amongst the  
 undergrowth there were many{wild      
{flowers}eg.{Wood Sorrel , Bluebell ,  
{Celandine, Comfree and Wood Anemone.
