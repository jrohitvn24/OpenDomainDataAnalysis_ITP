		<content> The Sunken Church was most probably   
 the first church in Bramcote. It was  
 built on a hill at the top of Cow Lane
 in the 13th/14th century.Since the    
 church was small, a new one was built.
 The Nave and Chancel were pulled down 
 in 1862 leaving only the Tower.       
 St. Michael's Church of England was   
 built in 1861 on land given by John   
 Sherwin Gregory. The bells and old    
 font from the sunken church were put  
 into the new church.                  
 The Methodist chapel and St. Gregory's
 Catholic Church Hall are relatively   
 new buildings.
