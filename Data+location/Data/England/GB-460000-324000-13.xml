		<title>13WILLOUGHBY CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church in Willoughby started in   
 the 13th century.Before Mr Bookless   
 the present vicar there have been 40  
 other vicars.There has been quite     
 a lot changed and added in the        
 church.The aisles have been partially 
 rebuilt and there have been some choir
 stalls added and a chantry chapel     
 built by the Willoughby family.Before 
 the organ was installed,there was a   
 coke-burning stove there and music was
 provided by a harmonium.The organ     
 has recently been moved from the      
 chancel to the nave and thoroughly    
 repaired .This is due to dampness on  
 the walls of the church.The clock     
 was put in the tower as a memorial    
 to mark the end of the First World    
 War,paid for by the village people.   
 There are 6 bells in the tower which  
 are rung regularly for services.
