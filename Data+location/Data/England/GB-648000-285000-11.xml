		<content> The landscape, an undulating patchwork
 of hedgerowed fields, winding leafy   
 lanes and collections of copses, is   
 inset with farm buildings, many       
 several years old in origin, steep    
 roofed with tiles or thatch. Cottages 
 have been renovated by people who work
 out of the region, usually by uniting 
 several small terraced units into one 
 'executive' house. Retired people     
 occupy those remaining in an original 
 and sometimes decaying state. There   
 are some modern style brick buildings,
 especially in Rushmere near the A12.  
 Both Henstead and Rushmere have a     
 group of utilitarian but soundly built
 council houses for those who cannot   
 afford their own homes. The group     
 sampled averaged 3 per household with 
 5 as a maximum. Being a rural         
 community most of the population speak
 a Suffolk dialect.                    </content>
