		<title>03AMPNEY BROOK'S WILDLIFE</title>
		<content>  Spraying pesticides, Dutch Elm       
 disease, and intensive farming which  
 made bigger and bigger fields has     
 caused the wildlife to become much    
 scarcer. Roadside verges are not now  
 being sprayed so cowslips, cranesbill 
 and other flowers are returning.      
 Landowners are replanting trees; birds
 and butterflies are flourishing. The  
{Ampney Brook} breeds wildlife; willow 
 and sedge warblers, ducks and         
 natterjack toads grow by it. Trout,   
 pike and maybe salmon live in the     
 brook. In summer the brook starts by  
 oozing out of the marshy ground. A few
 metres downstream it changes to a wide
 brook. Trout farming in the brook had 
 to be discontinued because of         
 parasites in the water. Great-crested 
 newts breed in the ditch by the       
 cemetry. Copses and woodland are      
 maintained as cover for game birds.   </content>
