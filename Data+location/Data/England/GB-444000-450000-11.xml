		<content>   A World War 2 bomber training       
{Royal Air Force}base, known as        
 Marston Moor, covers a substantial    
 area of our block. Soon after the war 
 was over, and the airport ceased      
 to be operational, the land was sold  
 for new uses.                         
   The former aircraft hangars and some
 remaining war-time buildings are owned
 by the Home Office, and are used to   
 store equipment for civil             
 emergencies, eg fire, drought. The    
 equipment includes old fire engines,  
 nick-named 'Green Goddess', Land      
 Rovers, trailers, lorries and pipes.  
 All are kept in good order ready for  
 use.                                  
   One hangar is owned by the Ministry 
 of Agriculture and is used to store   
 food. There are several derelict      
 buildings from which museums have     
 recovered world war items.            </content>
