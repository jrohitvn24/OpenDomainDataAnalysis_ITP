		<title>18Transport in the area</title>
		<content> Transport in rural areas is difficult.
 Stations are closing and bus servises 
 are being cut to as few as possible.  
 Unless you drive your own car it is   
 very difficult to get around.         
    A bus picks up some of our school  
 children each day but some of them now
 have to pay.Travel is free for under  
 eight who live more than two miles fr-
 om school and over eights who live    
 more than three miles away.           
    The settle to Carlisle railway pas-
 ses through our block and is in danger
 of being closed down.Local people are 
 running a campaign to stop this happ- 
 ining.There are no stations in our bl-
 ock.                                  
    The rivers in the block are not us-
 ed for transport but there are three  
 old mills.                            
    Jet aircraft practicing low flying 
 and night flying cross our block.     </content>
