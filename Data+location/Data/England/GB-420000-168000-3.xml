		<title>03FARMING AROUND MILDENHALL</title>
		<content> Modern British farming has the        
 following characteristics.            
 Firstly our farms are highly          
{mechanised.}We use combine harvesters,
 tractors, ploughs, seed drills,       
 bailers and many other machines.This  
 means that not so many workers are    
 needed.Secondly our wheat and barley  
 are now{specially bred varieties,     
 which are also high yielding.The crops
 are sprayed with pesticides,          
 insecticides and fungicides.This means
 that we can have better quality wheat 
 and barley.The third characteristic is
{chicken factories.}The farm that I    
 went to, Littlecote Park Farm, had    
 about 9,000 chickens.The chickens live
 in a controlled and artificial        
 environment. On some farms the same   
 happens with pigs.They are packed into
 one pen where they are quite cramped.
