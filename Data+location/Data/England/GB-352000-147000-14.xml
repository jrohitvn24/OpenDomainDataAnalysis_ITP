		<title>14FARMS IN WOOKEY HOLE</title>
		<content>   NEAR WOOKEY HOLE VILLAGE THERE ARE  
 FOUR DAIRY FARMS.FARMERS TAKE THEIR   
 CATTLE TO MARKET  FREQUENTLY TO REDUCE
 THE NUMBER OF COWS,OR TO PAY FOR SOME 
 MATERIALS. EVERY YEAR THEY HARVEST    
 THEIR CROPS,FERTILIZE,SPRAY AND MAKE  
 SILAGE AND THEN BALE,USUALLY IN       
 JUNE,JULY AND AUGUST.                 
                                       
 ALL THE FARMS HAVE OLD BUILDINGS      
 AND SHEDS WHICH WERE MADE FROM NATURAL
 LIMESTONE QUARRIED FROM THE MENDIP    
 HILLS.SOME OF THE OLD BUILDINGS       
 ARE STILL IN USE NOW FOR STORING      
 CATTLE FEED OR FERTILIZER BAGS OR IF  
 THE OLD SHEDS ARE BIG ENOUGH THEY WILL
 BE USED FOR MILKING.                  
                                       
                                       
 MOST OTHER FARMS IN THE AREA ARE      
 ALSO DAIRY OR MIXED FARMS.            
                                       </content>
