		<title>15Nether Stowey: Police</title>
		<content> We have the only village police       
 station this side of Bridgwater. It is
 manned by one constable. His police   
 van carries radio communication and an
 initial breathalysing kit. On his     
 person he has a pair of handcuffs and 
 a truncheon. A policeman's uniform    
 hasn't changed in style for 35 years .
 He is in daily contact with Taunton   
 Police. They often require him to     
 attend accidents. There is an accident
 on the A39 on average once a week.    
 This area has very little crime. There
 are occasional burglaries and car     
 thefts, also deer poaching on the     
 hills. The village's biggest problem  
 is vandalism of certain buildings.    
 There have been two instances of glue 
 sniffing and in recent years one of   
 rape. In the 19th century the Rose and
 Crown often served as a court. Taunton
 County Court tries serious crimes.    </content>
