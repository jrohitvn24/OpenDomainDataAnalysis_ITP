		<content>SANDHURST VILLAGE SHOP                 
 The only shop in Sandhurst Village is 
at Box Cottage Nurseries, it is owned  
by Mr &amp; Mrs Robinson. The building is  
very small, more like a little hut, and
the Robinsons run it more as a hobby   
and as a convenience for the village   
residents. It is a place where people  
can call in for a chat and exchange    
village gossip.                        
 The shop sells sweets, ices and drinks
for the village children. It keeps a   
small stock of tinned and packet foods 
which are mainly for Â£emergency' since 
most villagers do their weekly shopping
in Gloucester. It also acts as the sub-
post office for the local area.        
 The Robinsons know a lot about the    
village and its residents but they may 
retire soon. Villagers are worried that
when this happens no-one else will want
to take on the little shop.            </content>
