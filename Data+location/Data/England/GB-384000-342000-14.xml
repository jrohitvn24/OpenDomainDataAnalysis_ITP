		<content>One of the games we play at school is  
Hop-scotch.In this game a stone is     
thrown into a grid of 10 squares.You   
hop there to collect it then hop back. 
Stick in the mud is a game where one   
person is on,The others run away but   
if they are ticked they stand with     
arms out straight until someone runs   
under there arms.If you are ticked     
three times you must be the person     
on.Other games involving 'tick' are    
Rallyo and Off ground tick.In the Red  
Rover two teams stand opposite each    
other joining hands one team shouts    
'Red Rover,Red Rover send Philip right 
over'.Philip must leave his team and   
try to get through the team, If he     
fails he must join them.
