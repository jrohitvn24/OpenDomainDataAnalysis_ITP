		<title>15A DAY OUT TO CHATHAM, 1985</title>
		<content>  I shut the door behind me at 9.30    
a.m, ready to go to Samantha's home,   
which is nearby.  By the way my name is
Teresa Kujawska.  I am around 14 years 
old and lead a normal life in Strood,  
South-east of England.                 
  By the time I get there, she is      
already waiting outside her house,     
dressed up and wearing a little make-up
(lipstick and blusher).                
  We walk down to Strood railway       
station, talking about various topics. 
We walk through a glass door into a    
spacious entrance area where, on the   
right hand side is the ticket office   
and opposite is a kiosk.  We buy our   
tickets, normally 30p return.          
  The train arrives not long after.  We
get on and shut the doors ourselves.   
Inside, the train has seats, arranged  
in rows opposite one another. The      
upholstery is checked.    continued..  </content>
