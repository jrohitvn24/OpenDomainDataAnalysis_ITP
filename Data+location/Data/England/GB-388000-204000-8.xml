		<content> The Dressing of the Wells is a        
 procession of children carrying       
 letters spelling the name of the day -
 "Ascension". The wooden structures    
 are covered with moss and then garden 
 flowers. In earlier days wild flowers 
 were used. The afternoon begins with a
 church service. Afterwards comes a    
 procession through the streets,headed 
 by the children carrying the decorated
 letters. Next comes the vicar and     
 crucifer more children carrying posies
 and then a silver band. At the Wells  
 thanks are given for the gift of      
 water. A tea for all the village      
 children follows and later sports on  
 the playfield are enjoyed by everyone.
 A recent annual event, now two years  
 old, is a Fun Run.  It is a half      
 marathon undertaken either by running 
 or cycling. Much of it is over steep  
 hills around the area.                </content>
