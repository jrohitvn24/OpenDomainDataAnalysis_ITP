		<title>05LOWESWATER VILLAGE HALL.</title>
		<content> The original village hall was a wooden
 hut. When the school closed about 40  
 years ago, the building was taken over
 as the V.H. The hall is run by a      
 committee of about 11 members. They   
 represent groups who use the hall.    
 They meet 3 or 4 times a year to      
 reveiw maintenance, fund raising and  
 letting. The care taker lives on the  
 premises in the old school house. An  
 annual Garden Fete is held at the V.H.
 and is organised jointly with the     
 church council. The proceeds are      
 shared between the Hall and the       
 church. The hall is used for parish   
 Council meetings, dances, W.I., Whist 
 Drives, '77 club, F.E. clases and     
 Wedding Receptions. It is also used   
 for craft Exhibition on Show Day,     
 the start and finish of the Triathlon 
 and the Horseshoe Race.
