		<content>   This is a mainly rural area, only   
 touching part of the village of       
{Offchurch}at its western edge. To the 
 east,{Long Itchington}is the next     
 village and to the north,{Hunningham. 
   The main thoroughfare is the{Fosse  
{Way}running North/South. Classed as a 
 minor road it nevertheless carries a  
 volume of fast traffic. Local traffic,
 commuting from{Leamington}to the      
 nearby villages uses the{Welsh Road   
 and the road from{Offchurch}to{Long   
{Itchington.                           
   The land comes to its highest point 
 at the top of{Snowford Hill}and then  
 drops away rapidly to the East on the 
 plain of the{River Itchen.            
   The{Grand Union Canal}crosses the   
 south of the area and is well used by 
 holiday makers.                       
   A bus links{Leamington}with{Radford,
{Offchurch, Long Itch.}and{Stockton.   </content>
