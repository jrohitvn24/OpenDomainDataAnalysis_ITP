		<content> CONSTITUTED A PHYSICAL, POLITICAL AND 
 CULTURAL DIVIDE.                      
                                       
 THE DYKE DID NOT REMAIN LONG A        
 POLITICAL AND CULTURAL DIVIDE.  WITH  
 THE DECLINE OF MERCIAN POWER THE WELSH
 MOVED EASTWARDS AGAIN AND THERE IS NO 
 DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING WHY AT LATER 
 STAGES IN HISTORY CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS
 OF WELSH SPEAKERS WERE LOCATED TO THE 
 EAST OF OFFA'S DYKE.  TRACES OF THIS  
 HISTORICAL PROCESS ARE STILL EVIDENT  
 TODAY.  IT IS CLEAR THAT THE          
 SHROPSHIRE MARKET TOWN OF OSWESTRY,   
 FOR EXAMPLE, WHICH LIES APPROXIMATELY 
 THREE MILES EAST OF THE NEAREST       
 SECTION OF THE DYKE, WAS ONCE EITHER  
 UNDER WELSH OCCUPATION OR AT LEAST    
 UNDER RADICAL WELSH INFLUENCE.  WITHIN
 THE TOWN CAN BE FOUND SEVERAL WELSH   
 CHAPELS AND THE COMMUNITY IS STILL AN 
 IMPORTANT MARKET AND TRADING AREA     </content>
