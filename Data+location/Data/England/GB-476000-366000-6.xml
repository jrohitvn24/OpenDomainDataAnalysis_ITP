		<title>06Oil seed rape</title>
		<content>   Oil seed rape is a crop which has   
 recently become more in demand and    
 profitable to produce. It is grown for
 its{oil content,}which has become more
 in demand in these times of a health  
 conscious public. The more commonly   
 grown variety produces an oil low in  
{erucic acid,}which can be used for    
{human consumption,}such as in         
 margarine, cooking oil and salad oil. 
 The less common variety produces an   
 oil high in erucic acid, used for     
{industrial lubrication,}particularly  
 in jet engines. The remains are       
 pressed, and the resulting{rape seed  
{meal}is used in cow cake and pig meal.
 The straw is used for cattle bedding. 
   Although the crop was known in      
 Biblical times, new varieties mean    
 that it can be grown in our climate   
 with increasing success.
