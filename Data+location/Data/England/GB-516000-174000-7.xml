		<content> The Swimming Baths at Richmond (indoor
 and outdoor) were opened in 1967. The 
 pools are filled up using a large hose
 and it takes about a day and a half to
 fill.They change the water completely 
 once a year and keep it clean by      
 passing the water through filters made
 out of crushed sea-shells.The         
 temperatures of the waters are: 64-65F
 in the outdoor pool,71-80F in the     
 large indoor pool and 84-85F in the   
 learner pool. The large pool is 25m   
 long and 10m wide.The springboards are
 1 metre and 3 metres from the surface 
 of the water and the platform board is
 5 metres. There are between 24 and 28 
 galas every year. About thirty schools
 use the pool each week.There are a    
 number of special clubs including an  
 asthms club. It gets very busy on hot 
 days in summer when people enjoy      
 swimming and sunbathing on the grass. </content>
