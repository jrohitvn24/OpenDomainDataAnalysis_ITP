		<content>   On the 19.6.85 we went to the       
 only airbase in Cornwall,R.A.F.       
 St.Mawgan.After getting a pass at the 
 gatehouse a Flying Officer drove us to
 42.Squadron's officer's mess,which    
 was in a bit of a mess! Another F.O.  
 told us that 42.Squadron was the only 
 on the base.Originally torpedo bombers
 it is now a nimrod Squadron involved  
 amongest other things,in search and   
 rescue and fishery protection.About   
 130 people are attached to the        
 Squadron.Up to 40,000 people attend   
 the yearly charity raising airday.    
 Called R.A.F.Treblesue when           
 it opened in 1943 this airbase alone  
 in Britain avoided bombs as it was out
 of the range of the German planes,now 
 a nimrod can fly from Cornwall to     
 America with out refueling.
