		<content> Many local farmers are keen members   
 of the Meynell and South Staffordshire
 Hunt and preserve copses and woods to 
 provide cover for the fox, at the same
 time providing homes for wild animals 
 and birds. It is great to see hounds  
 working, following the scent of the   
 fox, and one hopes for a good chase   
 over a few fences in pursuit of       
 Charlie.  It is a good sport, as he is
 either caught and killed instantly, or
 he gets clean away.                   
                                       
 Many estates employ gamekeepers to    
 raise pheasants and partridges, and   
 then organised shoots take place. Well
 trained retriever dogs fetch the shot 
 birds back for their owners.  Adults  
 and children belong to clubs and fish 
 the many small pools, often using the 
 new type of weights which are harmless
 to birds.                             </content>
