 the two pet goats. Then she gets a    
 breakfast of cereals &amp; eggs for the   
 family. Next the two children go to   
 school. At midmorning her husband     
 comes in for sandwiches &amp; cake, &amp;     
 later for lunch she will cook a meal, 
 after this she goes to a teaching job.

 children from school and take them to 
 Cubs and Brownies. When the children  
 come home they go to bed.
