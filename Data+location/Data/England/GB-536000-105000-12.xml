		<content>                                       
 Roger Mussell is the local pet shop   
 owner,having lived in woodingdean for 
 35 years.His favourite animals are    
 foxes which can be found,along with   
 badgers and wild birds,in the local   
 valleys.He has thirty to forty        
 animals at home.When he first started 
 to work with animals he was seventeen 
 and has owned the local pet shop for  
 nineteen years.He chose Woodingdean   
 because it was where he lived.In his  
 spare time he likes watching badgers  
 or going to "good" pop concerts.He    
 never goes to visit zoos.Wednesdays he
 spends at Rudyard Kipling School      
 taking a club.He feels snares are a   
 poor way of killing wild animals. A   
 lot of his time is spent looking after
 wild animals that local people find   
 and bring along to him.
