		<content>{Skipping}is a favourite game of girls.
 This game may be played by three      
 people or more. Two people swing the  
 rope while the other person skips.    
 While the others are waiting they sing
 a song that the person skips to. This 
 game is good because nobody wins and  
 nobody loses.                         
                                       
  The games children play are numerous.
 If we are not in an energetic mood we 
 might sit down to a game of {Space    
{Invaders.}It is a game played with a  
 computer. You are a pilot defending   
 the Earth from alien invader          
 spaceships. There are different       
 versions. Sometimes you may be        
 defended by shields. On the other hand
 you may have to dodge the missiles    
 without protection.
