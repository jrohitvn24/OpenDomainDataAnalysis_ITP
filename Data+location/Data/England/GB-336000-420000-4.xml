		<content>SOUTHPORT SHRIMPS ARE FAMOUS AND       
FISHING AND SHRIMPING HAVE BEEN CARRIED
OUT BY BANKS AND CROSSENS FISHERMEN FOR
CENTURIES.TRACTORS HAVE NOW REPLACED   
THE HORSE AND CART BUT IT IS STILL A   
DIFFICULT JOB.                         
 SHRIMPERS SAILED OUT IN BOATS FROM    
CROSSENS SLUICE TO THE SEA.FISHERMEN   
COULD HANDNET FOR SHRIMPS,PLACING      
THEIR CATCH IN DEEP BASKETS CALLED     
"LEAPS".THE "CARTSHANKERS" USED A HORSE
DRAWN CART TO LAY NETS.                
 IN THE PAST FISHERMEN WOULD GO TO FISH
SOMETIMES TWICE A DAY AND THEIR        
FAMILIES WOULD CLEAN,BOIL AND SORT THE 
SHRIMPS.MOST FISHERMEN'S WIVES USED TO 
GO ROUND TO HOUSES CARRYING BASKETS    
FULL OF SHRIMPS TO SELL.SOME ALSO WENT 
TO NEARBY MARKETS AND SHRIMPS WERE     
SOLD BY THE GILL OR IN PINT MEASURES.  
 TODAY THE SHRIMPERS HAVE OTHER JOBS   
WHEN THEY ARE NOT FISHING.             </content>
