		<title>14PUMPING STATION,BAUNTON.</title>
		<content>                                       
  At the Baunton pumping station two   
 bore holes have been drilled 70m under
 the ground. The water is pumped       
 through a submersible pump to the     
 surface. It is then collected into a  
 tank. Chlorine is put into the water  
 so that it kills all germs. Super     
 chlorine is then put into the water to
 make it even clearer. Finally Sodium  
 dioxide is mixed with the water to    
 eliminate the taste of the chlorine.  
  Once the water is clean it is pumped 
 uphill about 1.6 km to the reservoir  
 on the Gloucester Road. The reservoir 
 is on high land so that water from it 
 can flow downhill into the town of    
 Cirencester. It is stored underground 
 because if it touches the surface     
 germs will get back into it.
