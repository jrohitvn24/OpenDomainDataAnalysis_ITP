		<content> expand.  Unfortunately because of the 
 nearby A38 trunk road it was virtually
 impossible to increase runways to     
 cater for larger and more up to date  
 planes.  After much thought and many  
 meetings with neighbouring Counties   
 Nottingham and Leicester it was       
 decided to move to Castle Donington   
 and open the East Midlands Airport    
 which is now an extremely busy        
 International port.                   
 Since then the buildings and hangers  
 have been used as a small Industrial  
 site.                                 
 Recently plans have been approved to  
 start, once more, a local flying      
 school at Burnaston airfield.
