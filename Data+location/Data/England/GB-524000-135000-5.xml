		<title>05GOFF'S PARK, CRAWLEY</title>
		<content> Many people visit this natural park   
 for its variety. There is an enclosed 
 paddling pool surrounded by trees and 
 play area for children. Others can    
 relax with a hot cup of tea or a cold 
 ice cream. For active children there  
 are swings and apparatus. Train lovers
 can take a miniature railway journey  
 through the trees. Boats can be sailed
 on a small pond. Nature lovers find   
 squirrels, birds, fish and trees. A   
 main attraction is the big landscaped 
 pond with gardens. Geese and ducks    
 will eat leftovers from picnics.      
 Goff's House, the Area Education      
 Office and the original residence of  
 the park, and the Council's glass-    
 houses are near the pond. Energetic   
 adults use the pitch and putt course. 
 Crawley Cricket Club play on the green
 most weekends in summer. Walkers on   
 Sundays can listen to the silver band.</content>
