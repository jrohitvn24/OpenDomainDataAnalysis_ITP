		<content>{A. Although I said the Workshops would
{not bother us I think I would knock   
{those down.                           
 Q. What do you think about the        
 shopping centre?                      
{A. The shops are okay I suppose but we
{could do with a better selection as   
{nearly all of the shops have the same 
{style of shoes and clothes.           
 Q. Do you like Ashington ?            
{A. I suppose Ashington is alright but 
{we have never known any other place so
{we could not compare it with anywhere 
{else.In actual fact we have noticed   
{that this part of Ashington is much   
{cleaner than the centre of the town   
{itself.In the centre of Ashington you 
{could just have a pair of net curtains
{at the windows about a fortnight and  
{they would be cream with muck instead 
{of being white. }
