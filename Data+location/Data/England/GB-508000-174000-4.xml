 ON WEDNESDAY AFTER SCHOOL BETWEEN     
 6.15 PM AND 7.30 PM I GO TO A CLUB    
 CALLED THE WEDNESDAY CLUB. WE MEET IN 
 BEDFONT BAPIST CHURCH WHICH IS IN     
 HATTON ROAD, IT COSTS FIFTEEN PENCE TO
 GET IN. THE LADIES THAT TAKE US ARE   
 CHRIS, SUE, SALLY AND JACKIE. WE PLAY 
 GAMES LIKE ROUNDERS WHERE YOU HAVE    
 TO HIT THE BALL AND RUN TO THE BASES  
 IF A PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE GETS THE
 BALL AND STUMPS THE BASE WITH IT YOU  
 ARE OUT. WE ALSO PLAY TREASURE HUNT   
 WHERE THERE ARE TWO TEAMS AND SOMEONE 
 IS SITTING ON A CHAIR IF THEY CALL    
 SOMETHING LIKE A COIN YOU HAVE TO     
 BRING IT TO THEM AS FAST AS YOU CAN.  
 THE FIRST TEAM TO DO THAT GETS ONE    
 POINT. WE HAVE LESSONS ABOUT ALL SORTS
 OF THINGS LIKE WHERE FOOD COMES FROM  
 ETC                                   
             I ENJOY MY CLUB           </content>
