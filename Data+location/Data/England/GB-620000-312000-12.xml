		<title>12Hellesdons Community Centre</title>
		<content> The community centre was opened on    
Jan 10 1959 by Mr.T.Taylor,head of the 
secondary modern school.The caretakers 
wages are paid by the local council,   
but the manager has to raise money to  
pay for all the improvements which     
they make inside.It costs about 10,000 
pounds a year to run. Many people rent 
out the rooms.Some of these groups are 
eg. playgroup,friendship club,brownies,
St.Johns ambulance,horticulture,toppers
,Hellesdon players,Bowls club,Yoga,the 
conservatives and the Royal British    
Legion.Just after the war money was    
raised  by the welcome home fund.This  
was the begining of the fund for the   
centre.Every organisation has one free 
room a week.After the centre was built 
everyone was asked to donate a chair.  
The centre is so heavily used  that    
there are plans for an exstention.
