		<content> The dwellings in the area are widely  
 spaced, giving shelter to wild life   
 and indigenous flowers and trees. The 
 highest part to the West is natural   
 grassland with bracken on granite. As 
 the land falls, gently undulating,    
 there is mixed woodland, mainly       
 deciduous, and finally pastureland and
 orchards. There is a small area of    
 uncultivated commonland. A{wildfowl   
 sanctuary has been set up by a stream 
 with small pools. Many small animals  
 and insects live in the wide roadside 
 verges. While some hedges have been   
 removed, most are still the ancient   
 mixtures with deciduous trees spread  
 along them. The weather is affected by
 the mass of the Malvern Hills. The    
 area is designated as one of{outstand_
{ing natural beauty} and two fields are
 administered by the{Conservation      
 Society to protect the wild flowers.  </content>
