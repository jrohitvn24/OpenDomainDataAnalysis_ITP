		<content> The "Blues" play at Brunton Park in   
 the Second Division of the Canon      
 League. This is a luxury since their  
 average "gate" last season was just   
 above 4,000. With no share of away    
 "gates" and their most attractive     
 "derby" fixture removed with Newcastle
 promoted to the First Division, United
 have to exist on a shoe string. For   
 their game with fellow strugglers     
 Shrewsbury, Carlisle had only 12 fit  
 players, including the 40 year old    
 manager "Pop" Robson, who was substit-
 ute. Carlisle lost 0-2 and slipped to 
 bottom of the Division.               
 The ground is well appointed with a   
 modern Centre and Wing Grandstands.   
 Few extra precautions had to be taken 
 after the 1985 Bradford fire, though  
 four surveillance cameras are to be   
 installed with grant aid from the     
 Football Ground Improvement Trust.    </content>
