		<content> The oldest house in Comberton is the  
 vicarage where the vicar lives. It was
 built in the fifteenth century which  
 makes it five hundred years old.      
 The newest house in Comberton is on   
 the road called Green End. It was     
 built in the twentieth century, the   
 century we are in now, which makes it 
 about one month old.                  
 There are two estates in Comberton,   
 Janes and Kentings. Janes, the oldest 
 estate was so called because the      
 builders who built it were called     
 Janes. Kentings estate was called that
 because the land was known as         
 Kenting's Land.                       
 From the centre of the village by the 
 duck pond you can see lots of houses. 
 Houses with thatched roofs, half      
 timbered walls and spread foundations.
