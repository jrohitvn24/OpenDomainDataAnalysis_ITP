 This centre, utilising good sandy     
soil and road communications, was      
opened in 1970. It covers an area of   
seven acres. An average of 1,500       
people from all over the county visit  
each week, mostly at weekends. The     
main items sold are trees and shrubs   
(brought in once a year) and rock and  
bedding plants and vegetables. The     
house plants come from Holland and     
Denmark.                               
                                       
 There are buildings housing           
greenhouses, sheds and conservatories, 
made by a firm in Irchester. The       
prices for these range from 700        
pounds- 7000 pounds.                   
                                       
 The whole area is very pleasantly     
landscaped.                            
                                       </content>
