		<title>16Religions- Sparkhill B'ham</title>
		<content>In the area of Sparkhill there is one  
Sikh Temple which is called a gurdwara.
There is an English Martyrs church     
which is a part of English Martyrs     
School, a Roman Catholic school.       
   The gurdwara is quite small,and is  
painted orange on the outside. The     
gurdwara was a Day Nursery and a church
before becoming a Sikh church. Sikh men
wear turbans on their heads to cover   
their hair which is kept long as part  
of Sikh custom.                        
   There are also many Muslims and     
Hindi people in Sparkhill. My school is
a Church of England School called      
St.John's.
