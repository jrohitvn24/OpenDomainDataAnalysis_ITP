		<content> The average home is very comfortably  
 furnished and has many labour saving  
 devices e.g.vacuum cleaner,washing    
 machine,fridge/freezer,toaster,food   
 mixer &amp; some have dish washers.       
 Kitchens have fitted cupboards and    
 units.During working days most        
 families have breakfast and leave home
 as follows;Dad before 8_00a.m.,       
 children about 8_30.Some mothers have 
 full or part_time jobs.At weekends    
 Sunday lunch is still a tradition with
 roast beef &amp; Yorkshire puddings etc.  
 Very few families attend church or    
 chapel.Clothes tend to be based on    
 American fashion ie.jeans,sweaters,   
 training shoes.Formal dress is only   
 used for special occasions.Leisure    
 time within the home tends to be spent
 watching TV or some new Technological 
 invention eg. home computer,or        
 pursuing a hobby.                     </content>
