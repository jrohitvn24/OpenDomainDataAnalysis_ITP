		<content>Blackford Church of England Voluntary  
Aided Primary School is the only school
located in this area. The children at  
the school are drawn from a wide area. 
A School has been on the site since    
1831 and during the time of this survey
it has undergone extensive repairs. As 
the school is Voluntary Aided the      
Governors have to find a proportion of 
total cost of 26000 pounds amounting   
to a little over 6000 pounds.          
The school has 42 pupils and 2 full    
time and 1 part-time teachers. The     
school opens at 9.00p.m. and closes at 
3.30p.m. One hour is taken for lunch   
and the school meals are prepared on   
the site. Children transfer from this  
school when they are eleven and go to  
schools either in Carlisle or Longtown.
