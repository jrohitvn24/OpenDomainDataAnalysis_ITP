		<content> Scotland Road and Great Homer St. were
 regarded as the heart of L'pool.  Many
 residents  remember  terraced  housing
 and a close-knit community before dual
 carriageway, the new tunnel deveopment
 and high-rise blocks changed the area.
 A resident told us:                   
{"The  people  knew  they  didn't want 
{ those}(skyscrapers){up. They went to 
{ Kirkby,Southdene &amp; Skelmersdale.They 
{ wanted  to go together but it didn't 
{ work  out  that  way. Families  were 
{ split up.Now they're all scattered." 
 Another said, dramatically:           
{"Uncle  George  couldn't believe what 
{ had happened here when he came back. 
{ He was 79 and cried in the  street." 
 Many spoke of a different atmosphere: 
{"The  neighbours  were  friends. They 
{ would help you if you were sick. You 
{ could  leave your door on the latch. 
{ Now people lock themselves in."      </content>
