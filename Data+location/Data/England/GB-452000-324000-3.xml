		<title>03HEALTH IN EAST LEAKE</title>
		<content> East Leake's health centre is based in
 the centre of the village,adjacent to 
 the library. The practice consists of 
 four doctors and the necessary nurses 
 and staff.The practice serves East    
 Leake and its surrounding area.       
 Doctors report that approximately     
 nine-thousand people are registered   
 patients.                             
 Careful monitoring of people takes    
 place from the day they are born by   
 means of health visitors,the school   
 nurse,etc.                            
 A dentist attends regularly and a     
 speech therapist,based at the         
 centre,keeps close links with schools.
 The school nurse has a very important 
 role,spending much of her time in     
 schools and liaising between          
 home,school and doctor.               
 The practice,in the main,refers its   
 patients to Nottm.Queen's Med.Centre. </content>
