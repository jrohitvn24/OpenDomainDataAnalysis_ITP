		<content> FROM OUR SURVEY WE FOUND THAT THE     
 MAJORITY OF THE WORKERS IN WEST       
 BUTTERWICK WORK IN SCUNTHORPE.  THIS  
 ACCOUNTS FOR 40% OF THE WORKING       
 POPULATION.  23% WORK IN THE VILLAGE  
 AND 11% IN THE NEIGHBOURING ISLE OF   
 AXHOLME VILLAGES.  9% MOVE AROUND THE 
 ISLE.  THESE ARE MAINLY IN THE        
 BUILDING TRADE.  7% WORK IN NEARBY    
 TOWNS eg DONCASTER, GAINSBOROUGH,     
 RETFORD, BRIGG, AND IMMINGHAM.  OF THE
 REMAINDER 1.5% WORK ABROAD AND THE    
 REST TRAVEL TO LONDON.  A SURVEY ON   
 HOUSING FOUND THAT 33% OF THE HOUSES  
 WERE BUILT BETWEEN 1946 AND 1965. 25% 
 WERE BUILT AFTER 1966.  BETWEEN 1926  
 AND 1945 12.5% WERE BUILT.  OF THE 264

 BUILT.  THE 3 OLDEST KNOWN HOUSES WERE
 BUILT BETWEEN 1766 AND 1785.          </content>
