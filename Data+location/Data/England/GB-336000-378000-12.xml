		<title>12  A Newspaper Reporter</title>
		<content>    The Headmistress of the Infants    
 School told us about her husband who  
 is a{Reporter}for a{National Newspaper
    He travels all over the country    
 looking for stories, but,the the main 
 area that he covers is Merseyside and 
 North Wales.                          
    A few years ago when he was in     
 Leeds, he had to go and report on a   
 coach bomb, when 25 people were       
 killed.                               
    Very recently, he went to write a  
 story on the{Bradford City Football   
{Club Disaster}when 52 people were     
 killed.                               
    To get the information to the      
 office, he telephones the newsdesk    
 where a secretary types out the story 
 as he reads it out to her.            
    He has been a reporter for 17 years
 and enjoys his work tremendously.
