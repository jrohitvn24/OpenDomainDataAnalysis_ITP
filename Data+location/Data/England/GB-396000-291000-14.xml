		<title>14Children and Money</title>
		<content> For my pocket money I get 90p per     
 week. I get 40p from my one nan and   
 50p from the other. I like to spend my
 money on things such as sweets, ice   
 cream, comics or even something for   
 school like a rubber, ruler or pencil 
 sharpener. At the moment though I am  
 saving my money because I want to     
 spend it all when I go on my holiday  
 to Cornwall. A pund is 100p and it    
 does not really buy much. Some sweets 
 are cheap like a penny or two pence   
 but most are about 15 pence each.     
 Anyway my mum says my teeth will drop 
 out if I eat too many sweets!         
 Some people ahve a lot of money in the
 bank. I would like that too but I     
 would want to spend it.Things are     
 going up in price all the time so I   
 think it is better to spend your money
 than keep it in a bank.
