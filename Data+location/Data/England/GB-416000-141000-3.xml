		<title>03Amesbury Sports Centre</title>
		<content>  The Sports Centre was opened in 1974.
 It was provided by Wiltshire County   
 Council and the former Amesbury Town  
 Council at a cost of Â£170,000.The two 
 squash courts  which were added in    
 1981 cost Â£70,000 and were paid for by
 profits from the sports centre.       
  It is equipped for the playing of    
 volley ball, basketball, netball,     
 badminton and five-a-side football.   
 There are also weight training        
 facilities.                           
  There is a school term time playgroup
 and an evening youth club and recently
 introduced Sunday roller skating. The 
 club has now purchased its own roller 
 skates as the firm which originally   
 hired out the skates charged so much  
 rental that the scheme was not        
 profitable. Now after an outlay of    
 Â£1,500 on skates it is a successful   
 addition to the facilities.           </content>
