 Dad and Paul get up at 6.30 am.They   
 have breakfast and Paul sorts the     
 papers for his paper round. Dad goes  
 to the station after waking Mum up    
 with a cup of tea. I go downstairs to 
 say hello to the dog and cat and to   
 have breakfast.I listen to the radio  
 while I get dressed and at 8.35 am I  
 go to school.We start at 9.00 am with 
 the register and then lessons with 15 
 minutes for play-time. We have 30     
 minutes for lunch at school then 30   
 minutes to play. At 1.00 pm we go     
 back to the classroom to do some work 
 on our topic, which this term is the  
 'Domesday Project'.After this we have 
 30 minutes of P.E. before we go home  
 at 3.15 pm. We have tea at about 7.30 
 pm when Dad comes home, wash up then  
 watch television until bedtime.       </content>
