		<content> The village lies in the{Sheppey Valley
 with the remain of its former         
{water-powerered textile mills}still   
 visible.  The older houses are built  
 of stone and surround the church and  
 cross with the modern houses extending
 along the road and further up the     
 valley sides.  It is a very charming  
 scene rather reminiscent of a Cornish 
 fishing village.  There is an old     
 manor house and opposite a former     
 textile mill which until recently     
 retained its water wheel.             
 Unfortunately between them lies the   
 main Wells to Shepton Mallet road     
 which carries considerable numbers of 
 cars and lorries through Croscombe's  
 narrow, winding main street.  The     
 church tower gives  glorious views    
 across the pantile roofs of the       
 houses. A local feature is the houses 
 of{conglomerate with black mortar.    </content>
