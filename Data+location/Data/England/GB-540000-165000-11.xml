		<title>11A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>    I wake up at 7a.m.. Then I get     
 dressed in my school uniform. I go    
 downstairs and have my breakfast. Then
 I get my coat on and go to school. I  
 walk to school normally but sometimes 
 I go in a car which is a piece of     
 metal on wheels and it is driven by   
 petrol.                               
    At school we do things like Maths, 
 English and comprehension. We have a  
 break time at half past ten.  We have 
 another at 12a.m. and then we have our
 lunch. Then we play till half past    
 one. Then we get changed for P.E..    
 This is when you climb things.        
 Sometimes I play rounders, then we    
 have a story read by our teacher, Mrs 
 Edwards, and then we go home.

 Hayes Primary School.
