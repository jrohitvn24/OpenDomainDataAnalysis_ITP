		<title>13HORSE RIDING CLUB.</title>
		<content> The horse riding club is held in the  
 stables.  Matron takes us there. There
 are quite a lot of horses there, I    
 ride one called Baford, he is quite   
 big. We have two groups with about    
 eight people in each.  It is very good
 fun. We sometimes have tests how to   
 brush and pick out the bit of dirt in 
 its hoof and things like that. We do  
 not do jumping most of the time we    
 either just walk round trot or canter 
 sometines we do the steering of the   
 horse and sometimes we play games or  
 races.  When I first went I didn't    
 know anything I had never been on a   
 horse and since then they have taught 
 me a lot.  Sometimes also we go out on
 the horses.  The horse riding stable  
 is not very far away, it is down the  
 drive and around the corner near the  
 bus stop.  I think it is excellent.
