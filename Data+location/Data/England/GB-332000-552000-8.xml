		<content> "There is a broad curriculum so that  
 basic skills learned can be used in a 
 variety of lessons formally or through
 activity methods.Each child is encour-
 aged to apply his skill &amp; expertise to
 the subject being studied".(Quote from
 school prospectus). We have 2 houses, 
 Solway and Skiddaw &amp; we get points    
 for our work which we record on a     
 chart.Each year these are added up &amp;  
 a cup given to the house with the most
 points. Outside the school is a field 
 area &amp; playground.Sports include foot-
 ball,cricket,rounders,hockey, netball,
 tennis &amp; various team games.Each year 
 we join with 7 small schools for      
 football, cross-country, netball &amp;    
 sports.Cups are awarded to the winning
 schools in each event. Since 1980 the 
 "Parents &amp; Friends of the School" have
 organised many events. The recorder   
 group play at assembly &amp; concerts.    </content>
