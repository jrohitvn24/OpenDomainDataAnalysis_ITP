		<title>18LOCAL CONCERNS, EGERTON</title>
		<content>   Residents of the village are        
 extremely concerned over the          
 possibilty of future housing          
 development in the area. A survey     
 revealed that there was 100%          
 opposition to further housing.        
   It is generally considered that     
 whilst local facilities are adequate  
 for the young and adults, there are   
 few facilities for teenagers and young
 adults.                               
   Considerable concern is felt over   
 the volume of traffic passing through 
 the village, the high speed limit,    
 and the lack of concern by the Highway
 Authority to their problems.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
