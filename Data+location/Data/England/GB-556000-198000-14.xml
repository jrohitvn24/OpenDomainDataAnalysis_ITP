		<title>14FOOTPATHS</title>
		<content> There are numerous{footpaths}in the   
 area but they tend to be rather       
 fragmented and would have originally  
 have been used for short cuts. The    
{countryside}they pass through is flat,
 a mixture of natural woodland, rough  
 grazing and arable farmland. Fields   
 are large with clear evidence of the  
 mass destruction of{hedgerows.}Many   
 footpaths tend to be overgrown and    
 difficult to follow. Several instances
 were found where the path had been    
 planted over. Most people care about  
 the paths but only walk them          
 occasionally, for recreation.         
 The giant{tele-communications mast}at 
 Kelvedon Hatch dominates the area and 
 is a clearly visible landmark for     
 miles around.
