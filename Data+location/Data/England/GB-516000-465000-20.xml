		<content>  The Information on this disc was     
 written by various individuals. I have
 shortened some of the material so that
 it fits onto one page. Two of the     
 contributions are presented over two  
 pages as it was not possible to       
 shorten them without losing a         
 substantial amount of information.    
   I used my own computer to enter the 
 data and of course did so in my own   
 time. It would have been better if the
 author's could have entered their own 
 pieces but we found both time and     
 equipment to be in short supply. Our  
 school requires at least one year's   
 notice if it is to use such a large   
 project in the curriculum.            
   Those of us that have been involved 
 have found the project fascinating and
 look forward to the publication of the
 video discs.
