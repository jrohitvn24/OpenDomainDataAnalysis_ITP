		<title>20THE CAUSEWAY</title>
		<content> The Causeway has various places of    
 interest for visitors to the Horsham  
 area. The Museum has exhibits dating  
 from Stone Age times. It has toys,    
 books and a 200 year old doll which   
 was found beneath the floor boards of 
 a local shop. They also have some old 
 sport gear and a smoking suit which   
 belonged to one of Queen Victoria's   
 sons. The town hall is often used for 
 fund raising events e.g jumble sales, 
 bazaars etc. It used to be the home of
 the local Magistrates Court and had   
 cells in the basement for the         
 prisoners appearing. St.Mary's Church 
 is at the end of the Causeway. Its    
 first vicar was Roger of Wallingford  
 in 1231. The tower and door way date  
 back to Saxon and Norman times.
