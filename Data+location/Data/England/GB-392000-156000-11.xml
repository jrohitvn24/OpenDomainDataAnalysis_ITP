		<title>11FARMING - WICK FARM</title>
		<content> Our farm is 76 acres for which we pay 
 approx. Â£60 per acre annually to WCC. 
 We have a dairy herd of 60 Friesian   
 cows and a Charolais bull. Each cow   
 produces about 5,800 litres of milk   
 per year; the milk is collected daily 
 by tanker. The calves are all sold at 
 Chippenham Market at 10-14 days of    
 age. We also keep about 15 pigs.      
 The sows farrow twice a year with an  
 average of 11 piglets per litter.     
 These piglets are weaned from the sow 
 at 5 weeks and then sold at market at 
 about 12 weeks old. As a self-employed
 farmer, my husband works extremely    
 hard - he gets up at 5.30am and is    
 rarely finished before 8 in the       
 evening, but he thoroughly enjoys his 
 work. I do all the farm accounts, VAT 
 and paperwork, and help on the farm   
 where necessary.
