		<title>01Goring Area</title>
		<content>Goring and the surrounding is underlain
by chalk. There is evidence of workings
in sevral disused chalk pits. The land 
is rolling downs,and Goring Gap is a   
deep valley carved out by the icy      
fingers of last ice age at its southern
most fringe. The River Thames runs     
through the Gap. The Roman Icknield Way
passes through the area hut no major   
modern roadway is included although the
roads are quite heavily used. There    
are several wooded areas and much      
arable farmland, the railway also      
passes through the area alongside the  
river. Wartime evidence includes       
several pillboxes guarding the Thames, 
and a local recreation  ground's gates 
were donated by the Belgian Air Force, 
as their headquarters were sited in    
Goring.
