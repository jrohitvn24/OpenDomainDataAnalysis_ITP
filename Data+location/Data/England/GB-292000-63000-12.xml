		<title>12A day in the life of a pupil</title>
		<content>    I usually wake up at 6.30 a.m. and 
 take my three dogs for a walk.I take  
 them to one of the few parks or       
 beaches which have not got a ban on   
 them against dogs.This recent ban     
 covers four out of five beaches and   
 especially ornamental gardens and     
 childrens parks.                      
    I walk to school at about 8.30 a.m.
 to arrive before the 9 o'clock        
 bell.School finishes at 3.45 p.m.     
 after having several breaks during the
 day.                                  
    In the evening I watch the         
 television or listen to some pop music
 before going to work at a hotel as a  
 waitress.I work for two hours earning 
 Â£1.15 an hour.The hotel is near the   
 sea and takes about fifty people.I    
 only work in the summer when holiday  
 makers flock to Torquay.
