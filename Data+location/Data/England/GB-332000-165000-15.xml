		<title>15A TYPICAL DAY FOR MARIE</title>
		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MARIE AGED 10.   
 I wake up in my quilted bed ready to  
 go down to eat my poached egg on toast
 for breakfast.                        
 I have to go to school in green skirt,
 white blouse and a green cardigan.    
 I travel to school by coach and when  
 we get there we go straight into the  
 playground.  When I get to school I do
 some reading and I have a book of     
 maths work.  In school we have an     
 assembly and all the children gather  
 together.                             
 We have dinner at 12 noon and after we
 have another playtime and more        
 lessons.                              
 I go home at 3.30 pm and at 8 pm I    
 watch a television programme called   
 Dallas.  After I have watched that, I 
 clean my teeth with a plastic brush   
 and then I go to bed.
