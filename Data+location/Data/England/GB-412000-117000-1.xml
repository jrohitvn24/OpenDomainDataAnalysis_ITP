		<title>01Review of Block 04120117</title>
		<content> This area of land lies to the west of 
 the River Avon,some eight miles south 
 of Salisbury and a few miles north    
 of the small town of Fordingbridge.   
 It is a sparsely populated rural      
 area,containing two small villages,   
{Breamore&lt;pop.324>}and{Whitsbury       
{&lt;pop.241>.}                           
 Well-drained chalk uplands,noted for  
 sheep and dairy farming, form the     
 northwestern corner of the block.The  
 land slopes down to the Avon in the   
 southeast,where the soft river clays  
 have formed marshland near Breamore.  
 Most of this area is arable farming   
 land, with wheat and barley being the 
 chief crops.Grazing still predominates
 on the uplands and near the river in  
 the east. There are a few areas of    
 woodland in the centre of this block, 
 mainly mixed deciduous but with one   
 conifer plantation.                   </content>
