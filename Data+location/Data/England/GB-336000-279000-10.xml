		<title>10THE ARBOR TREE NEAR CLUNBURY</title>
		<content>   The{Arbor Tree}is a black oak in the
 centre of{Aston_on_Clun.}It is not the
 original tree but it has been there   
 for 250 years.                        
   The tree has been decorated with    
 flags every year since 1786, the year 
 John Marston, lord of the manor,      
 married{Mary Carter}of{Sibdon castle. 
 A custom says Mary was so pleased when
 she saw the tree that she gave money  
 for the ceremony to be repeated every 
 year. Now every year the flags are    
 replaced. As May 29th was declared    
 Royal Oak Day by charter in 1660, the 
 ceremony is held on the last Sunday in
 May. It is a very colourful ceremony  
 with a procession through the village,
 the main focus of which is a child    
 bride and groom with attendants and   
 local organisations like the Women's  
 Institute carrying replacement flags  
 to be mounted on poles on the tree.   </content>
