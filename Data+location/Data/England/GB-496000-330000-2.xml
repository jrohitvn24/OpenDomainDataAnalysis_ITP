		<title>02ARABLE FARMING IN BOOTHBY</title>
		<content> Boothby's arable crops consisted      
 mostly of wheat and barley with a few 
 fields of hay.These had boundaries    
 marked out by hedges,fences or        
 trees.These crops could be used for   
 cereal,trade,exports and drinks such  
 as beer.                              
        The undulating ground varied in
 height from .265 _ .370ft. No evidence
 could be found of any recent changes  
 in crops.The land was a mixture of    
 slopes and flat in places.            
        Machinery was used to          
 spray,plough,sow and water the fields.
 The soil was fertile and the crops    
 were growing well in rows.The         
 machinery included tractors with      
 sprayers,harrows,drills,hay baler and 
 a combine harvester.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
