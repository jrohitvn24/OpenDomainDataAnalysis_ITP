		<content> WITHIN THE STUDY AREA THERE WERE THREE
 AREAS WHICH HAD LOCAL SHOPPING        
 FACILITIES. IN ALL CASES THE SHOPS    
 WERE CONVENIENCE GOODS SHOPS SERVING A
 VERY SMALL MARKET AREA. SHOPPERS USED 
 THE CENTRES FOR SMALL ITEMS AND DID   
 NOT TEND TO A LARGE AMOUNT OF SHOPPING
 IN THE CENTRES. HOWEVER, THESE CENTRES
 WERE USED VERY REGULARLY BY THE PEOPLE
 WITHIN THE SURVEY. IT IS DUE TO THE   
 HIGH FREQUENCY OF USE BY THE SHOPPERS 
 THAT THE MARKET AREA CAN BE SO SMALL  
 WHILE STILL ENABLING THE SHOPS TO MAKE
 A SATISFACTORY TURNOVER. THE SHAPE OF 
 THE MARKET AREA IS STRONGLY INFLUENCED
 BY THE LOCATION OF OTHER SHOPPING     
 CENTRES, USUALLY OFFERING A WIDER     
 SELECTION OF SERVICES. IN ALL CASES   
 THESE LOCAL SHOPPING CENTRES WERE     
 LOCATED AT A ROAD JUNCTION IN AN      
 EFFORT TO INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY.
