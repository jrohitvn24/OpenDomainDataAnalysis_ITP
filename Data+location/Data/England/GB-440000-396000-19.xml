		<title>19Rawmarsh dialect</title>
		<content>     The Rawmarsh area is rich in      
 dialect some of which may be regarded 
 as Yorkshire dialect but much of which
 is very local - while in common use in
 Rawmarsh it may not be used in other  
 parts of Rotherham. This reflects the 
 very localised sense of identity which
 leads some people to say, for example,
 "I come from Sandhill, not Rawmarsh". 
     Some dialect has its origins in   
 the mining tradition of the area but  
 much of it pre-dates this. The influ- 
 ence of television does not appear to 
 have significantly diminished the use 
 of dialect which is still strong among
 schoolchildren.                       
     As well as 'pure' dialect there   
 are also pronunciations like 'papper' 
 (paper) and 'skoyal' (school) which   
 should be regarded more as dialect    
 than as mispronunciations.
