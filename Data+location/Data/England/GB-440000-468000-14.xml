		<title>14HELPERBY FEAST.</title>
		<content> Every year, the first Monday after    
 July 11th,the feast comes.There are   
 races and a fancy dress,you get some  
 money even if you do not win. When    
 that finishes the fair starts. There  
 is a dodgem ring and an arcade for the
 older children and for the younger    
 ones a Bumpy Castle, hook a duck, roll
 the balls and throwing rings.It is 5op
 for a go on the dodgems &amp; 2op on the  
 stalls. There used to be a roundabout 
 but it was sold. A hotdog stall sells 
 drinks as well.A big generator on one 
 of the wagons makes enough power for  
 the lights,arcade and dodgems. When   
 the fair has finished it is packed up 
 into wagons and the caravans are put  
 behind the cars. All the long rails   
 have to fit on to the wagons to       
 transport them to the next stop.
