		<title>05A LOCK ON THE THAMES</title>
		<content>                                       
      Cleeve Lock was built in 1775 and
 is a great help to{transport}on the   
 river Thames.There is a resident      
 lock keeper with a small house next to
 his office.                           
                                       
      He told us when the{water}is up  
 in the lock it measures about 4 metres
 and when the{water}is down it measures
 about 1 metre.There is a weir to the  
 east of the lock keeping the{water}   
 flowing.                              
                                       
      Fridays on the river are mostly  
 "DOWN"days and the rest are usually   
 "UP"days excluding Saturday and Sunday
 which can be both.This is all because 
 of the{tourists}on the river with     
 people taking river cruises on hired  
 boats from the local areas.
