		<title>14STUDLEY,WARWICKSHIRE (cont.)</title>
		<content> Studley is bounded by the A435 and the
 A448 and on the map looks rather like 
 an upturned capital A.It is a thriving
 place but there does not appear to be 
 any focal point,any undisputed village
 centre.There is not enough industry in
 the village to cater for all of the   
 inhabitants and about 50% of the      
 working population have to commute to 
 mainly Redditch or Birmingham to find 
 jobs.Studley used to be a main centre 
 of the needle making industry and     
 although needles are still made       
 here,the importance of this to the    
 village is diminishing.Nowadays the   
 prominent feature is the modern,indeed
 futuristic Co-op supermarket.The      
 building has won design awards but is 
 regarded  as a monstrosity by many of 
 the local inhabitants.
