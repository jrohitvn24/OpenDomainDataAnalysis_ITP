		<content> WITCHAMPTON CHURCH: in 1984 in        
 Witchampton Church a small crypt was  
 discovered under the South Transept.  
 This was opened up and a staircase was
 built from the crypt to the vestry.   
 The church has a Parish Communion     
 service at 10am every Sunday except   
 for the 1st Sunday of the month when  
 there is a Family Service.            
 WITCHAMPTON METHODIST CHURCH: the     
 chapel  was built in 1890 on the site 
 of a 19th century chapel. The chapel  
 has its own burial ground, it is said 
 that the Romans used the terraced     
 ground on the western side of the     
 church towards the chapel as          
 vineyards. The chapel has its own hall
 used for a variety of local activities
 including the Brownie Pack meetings.  
 The chapel has no resident Minister   
 but is served from Wimborne, having   
 services each Sunday at 10.45am.      </content>
