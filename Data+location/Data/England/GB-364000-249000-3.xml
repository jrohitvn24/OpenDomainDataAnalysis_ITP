		<content> There is a sub-post office in Munder- 
 field. The present post mistress has  
 been in this position for about twelve
 months. There is one postal delivery a
 day, the postman arriving l0 o'clock  
 to l0.30 a.m.; there is also one      
 collection. Many of the local         
 pensioners collect their weekly       
 allowance from here, as this is more  
 convenient than having to travel to   
 Bromyard or Ledbury where they would  
 also have to wait in a queue.  There  
 are two post boxes in the area,  and  
 one public telephone kiosk.  Most     
 people now have a telephone in their  
 own homes, this is now almost a       
 necessity in the country.
