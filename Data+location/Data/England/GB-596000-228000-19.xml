      ABOUT THIS GREAT HORKESLEY       
               CLUB.                   
                                       
 I USED TO GO TO AN ART CLUB EVERY     
 WEDNESDAY AT 50 KEELERS WAY.IT WAS    
 FROM 4 OCLOCK UNTIL A QUARTER PAST    
 FIVE.I USED TO GO HOME FROM SCHOOL,   
 CHANGE AND MEET SUZANNE,A FRIEND OF   
 MINE WHO ALSO WENT TO THE CLUB.       
   AT THE CLUB WE COULD TAKE OUR OWN   
 PAINTS,OR USE THOSE BELONGING TO THE  
 TEACHER,A LADY CALLED JILL.WE HAD TO  
 PICK A PICTURE,THEN TRY TO DRAW IT ON 
 A PIECE OF ROUGH PAPER.WE WOULD THEN  
 PAINT IT ON A GOOD PIECE OF PAPER,AND 
 WE WOULD SOMETIMES USE SOME QUITE GOOD
 WATER PAINTS.JILL WOULD HELP US A LOT 
 WITH OUR PAINTING,AND SHE WOULD ALWAYS
 TELL US HOW GOOD IT WAS,EVEN IF WE    
 KNEW IT REALLY WAS'NT THAT GOOD AT    
 ALL.WE ALWAYS TOOK THE PAINTINGS HOME.</content>
