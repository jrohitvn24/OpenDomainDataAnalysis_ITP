		<content>   The youth club meets every Friday   
 from 7pm to 10pm and has 70 registered
 members who produce an average        
 attendance 20 rising to 50 with       
 visitors on disco nights. Most members
 are in the age range 12 to 18 years;  
 the age limit is 21.                  
   Membership costs 50p a year and     
 admission is 10p for members and 20p  
 for non-members, rising to 20p and 50p
 on disco nights. The club building    
 opposite the village hall is in a poor
 state and the club is threatened with 
 closure. A new management committee is
 presently trying to raise money to    
 cover repairs.                        
   Recent visits have included         
 ice-skating in Bournemouth and the    
 Calshot Activity Centre. The youth    
 club offers young people a worthwhile 
 alternative to spending Friday night  
 watching TV.                          </content>
