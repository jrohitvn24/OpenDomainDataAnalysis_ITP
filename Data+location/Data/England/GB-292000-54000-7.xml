		<title>07   JUDO  by Martin Welch</title>
		<content>  The Judo Club is situated on Bakers  
 Hill and I used to go on Wednesday    
 nights.                               
  Judo is useful for self defence. At  
 classes you all start off with the    
 same exercises then you get onto doing
 actual judo.                          
  We go in for competitions and can win
 medals and cups and so on. We went as 
 far as Newton Abbot for competitions  
 and also to Torquay and Exeter.       
  I won a bronze medal but in doing so 
 I got badly bruised down my spine so I
 don't do as much judo now.            
  We did have a karate club, but it was
 not well supported, so it had to      
 close.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
