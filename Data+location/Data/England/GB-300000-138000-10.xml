		<title>10   A GAME OF SKITTLES</title>
		<content>{Skittles}is a team game that is       
 played during the winter in the alleys
 of most{pubs}in West Somerset. A team 
 normally has 6 players who choose     
 their own team name. There are 3 hard 
 wooden balls and 9 skittles which are 
 put in a diamond pattern at the end of
 the alley. The balls are used to knock
 the skittles or pins over. To score   
 the ball must hit the 'Plate' at the  
 throwing end. Some names used in the  
 game are very strange. A 'Sergeant    
 Major' means you count the lowest     
 score of a player if someone is away. 
 If you hit a 'Flopper' all the pins   
 fall down with one ball. If you score 
 9 points with two balls then you have 
 a 'spare' and you can stick all the   
 skittles back up and throw again. A   
 'Sticker Up' is paid to do this for   
 you. If the ball hits the side of the 
 alley it is called a 'Banker'.        </content>
