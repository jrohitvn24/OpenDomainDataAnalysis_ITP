		<title>05THE REPORTER(CONT)</title>
		<content>  News is collected by journalists who 
 work for the Reporter,and by          
 free-lance reporters,(they pay        
 free_lance so much per line).         
{The paper relies on advertising for   
{a large part of its income.           
   News is chosen by the sub-editor,he 
 decides which of two good stories will
 make the head lines.Normally this will
 be the story which affects the people 
 most of all.                          
  Recently they have interviewed{Jerry 
{Marsden(BRADFORD A.F.C.FIRE).         
 Changes in the prices of raw materials
 would not alter the price of the      
 paper.                                
 Sometimes when they have too          
 little material they enlarge the size 
 of the printing.The employees work    
 from 9am to 5pm and two night shifts a
 week.The Reporter relies on a good    
 working relationship with the police. </content>
