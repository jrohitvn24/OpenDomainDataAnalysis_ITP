		<content>   The village of{Witley}is situated   
 4km to the south west of Godalming in 
 Surrey.The original village was a     
 linear development along the A283,    
 Petworth Road.In 1985 however,most of 
 the residential area of the village   
 lies to the west of the main road.Many
 of the houses have been built since   
 the turn of the century.              
   The area around Witley is very      
 picturesque.Rolling farmland, old     
 established woodlands and heathlands  
 combine to form a Wealden landscape   
 punctuated by old buildings of brick  
 and local Bargate stone.              
   Once in the area,it is best to      
 explore the locality on foot,using the
 well maintained footpaths.Away from   
 the main roads it is easy to escape   
 from the noise to enjoy the flora and 
 fauna of the Surrey countryside.
