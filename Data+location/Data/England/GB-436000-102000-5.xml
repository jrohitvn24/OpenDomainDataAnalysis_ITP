		<title>05HOUSES IN BEAULIEU</title>
		<content>    There was only one house that we   
 could find with a date on it and it   
 was Norris's shop. The date was 1876, 
 one hundred and nine years old.There  
 was also a builders with some weird   
 looking initials they were {B.B ,W.H  
 and {M.O}.                            
    Most houses in Beaulieu are        
 private. The one road we walked down  
 had eleven private houses .The houses 
 had funny names like Pepperbox house, 
 Old Bank house ,Morris house and      
 Warners house.                        
   There is one shop called Secrets of 
 the Forest. It was named after a book.
 They asked the lady who wrote the book
 if they could call it after the book. 
 The lady agreed and from that day she 
 has made little mice and sent them to 
 the shop from Wales where she lives.
