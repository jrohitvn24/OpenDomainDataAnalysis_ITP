  We have found that the most popular  
 hobbies /sports for adults were       
 gardening, walking, reading, knitting 
 and watching television. Swimming and 
 football were fairly popular. Other   
 hobbies mentioned included pigeon     
 racing, sewing, cricket, dominoes,    
 pool/snooker, fishing, visiting safari
 parks, darts and keeping fit.         
  Shirebrook has recently had a        
 much-awaited leisure centre           
 completed.It has been built next to a 
 dismantled railway embankment and is  
 thus conveniently situated near the   
 village centre. From the outside it   
 resembles an outsize water tank but   
 inside the decor is pleasant and the  
 whole place is well looked after with 
 little signs of vandalism.
