		<content> Very little new building has taken    
 place since the war, since the        
 local authority regards the area as   
 agricultural, and much of the area is 
 controlled by two large estates.      
 Around the farms are several farm     
 cottages for the workers.             
                                       
 A common development is to convert old
 barns and agricultural buildings into 
 dwellings, usually for the better-off.
                                       
 Local inhabitants are finding it      
 increasingly difficult to find        
 somewhere to live because of the      
 tremendous financial advantage of     
 people who work in London and have    
 access to large sums of money at low  
 interest rates.                       
                                       
 Petworth railway station is now a     
 dwelling owned by a journalist.       </content>
