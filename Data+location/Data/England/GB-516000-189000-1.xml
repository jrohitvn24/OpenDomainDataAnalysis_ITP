 The London Borough of Harrow has      
 about 200,000 inhabitants within its  
 20 square miles. It is a multi-ethnic 
 community, with a particularly        
 significant number of its citizens    
 being Asian of East African origin. At
 the present time (July 1985), nearly  
 25% of the population is from a racial
 group other than European.            
                                       
 EDGWARE, QUEENSBURY AND STANMORE      
                                       
 The information which follows is      
 concerned with the eastern part of the
 Borough only. Our D-Block is          
 nevertheless typical of the whole     
 area. It is urban: predominantly      
 residential with a significant amount 
 of light industrial and commercial    
 activity.
