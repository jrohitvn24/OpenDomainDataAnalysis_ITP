		<content>{Mearacre Farm}belonged to Mr. Swanton 
 OBE until 1960 when it was bought by  
 English Farms. Since then it has      
 changed hands several times. It is now
 called The Mearacre Farms Partnership.
 This includes farms at Patney and     
 Beechingstoke, and farms in Hampshire.
 Animals are kept, and corn is grown.  
 Last year there was a farm tour when  
 employees from Hampshire and Temple   
 Farm came along to visit Mearacre     
 Farm.                                 
 The Swanton family has owned{North    
{Farm}for 60 years. There are 700 acres
 of land. The crops grown are wheat,   
 barley, oil seed, and grass. The main 
 problem in the summer is drought.     
 Some of the land is watered regularly 
 to cope with the drought. The Swantons
 have some pets, but these do not mix  
 with the farm animals.
