office. It has been there 6 years and  
has 120 workers, mostly local, but some
are French or Scottish. They do not    
export. The workers are skilled and do 
not do shift or piece work. Some think 
that the building may close and move to
Stoke. Some people commented on the    
industrial troubles that had happened.
