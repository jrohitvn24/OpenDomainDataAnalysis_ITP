		<content>    We wanted to find out what a class 
 of 29 children aged 11 and their      
 parents did in their spare time.      
 Sporting activities were by far the   
 most popular children's pastime with  
 football(62%) and swimming(69%) the   
 clear leaders. 41% of the children    
 asked, watched television. A similar  
 proportion of parents said that       
 watching television was one of their  
 hobbies. There was evidence that some 
 children enjoyed sharing parents      
 hobbies(or vice-versa!). For example  
 six households listed either snooker  
 or fishing as a pastime for both child
 and parent. Another popular spare time
 activity of both child and adults was 
 reading - 31% of children and 47% of  
 adults included this.
