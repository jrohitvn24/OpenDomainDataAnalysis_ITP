		<title>06Where people live in Well</title>
		<content> Well is compact village sited around  
 the cross roads.Its boundaries are    
 fixed &amp; only infill building is       
 allowed.There are no estates and only 
 6 council houses &amp; 4 council bungalows
 are alike.Many cottages &amp; houses old &amp;
 new are stone built,others are        
 rendered,some painted and most with   
 pantile rooves.22% are rented houses ,
 few are tied.Apart from the alms      
 houses all have good sized gardens.   
   There are 2 big houses with stables,
 paddocks and tennis courts,a former   
 rectory,1 public house and several    
 substantial farmhouses.There are two  
 small holiday cottages,1 in good order
 for sale,the other is delapidated.Most
 of the older properties have been     
 modernised with central heating and   
 extended.An unusual feature is that   
 there are no street name signs and    
 only the council houses are numbered. </content>
