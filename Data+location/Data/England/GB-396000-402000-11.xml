		<title>11WHIT FRIDAY CONTESTS CONT.</title>
		<content>     Bands play on a first come first  
 play basis and a good deal of planning
 and instant decision is needed if a   
 band is to have any hope of visiting  
 all the contests. The roads throughout
 the valley are very congested with    
 coaches &amp; visiting spectators hurtling
 from venue to venue.                  
     As most of the top bands in the   
 country attend the contests, many     
 organising committees award 'local'   
 prizes in addition to the 'main'      
 prizes, to encourage the smaller and  
 less wellknown bands.                 
     It is customary for the Public    
 Houses close to the contests to open  
 for extended hours (unofficialy, in a 
 good many cases,this means 'all day').
     The contests start at around 4.30 
 pm. and continue until light fails. It
 is regarded by many as the greatest   
 free entertainment in the country.    </content>
