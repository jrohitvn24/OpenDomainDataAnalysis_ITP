		<title>18Southern Cheam, Surrey.</title>
		<content> The area of Cheam south of the railway
 lies on chalk and until the           
 establishment of the local waterboard 
 in l863 was waterless and therefore   
 largely unpopulated. It formed a      
 beautiful area of gently rolling      
 downland and not surprisingly         
 residential development was fairly    
 rapid once water was available. Large 
 late_Victorian and Edwardian detached 
 houses stretched from the village up  
 the slope of the Downs each one       
 glorying in its large garden filled   
 with trees, shrubs, Pampas grass and  
 flower beds. Many of the gardens have 
 since been sold and are occupied by   
 pleasant, more modern houses. Today   
 this is an area of expensive, detached
 medium to low density housing, much in
 demand by London's Commuter Population
 The residents jealously conserve the  
 environment and wildlife of Downland. </content>
