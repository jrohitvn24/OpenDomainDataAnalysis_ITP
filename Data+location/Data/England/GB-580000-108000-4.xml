		<title>04INDUSTRY IN HASTINGS</title>
		<content>  Traditionally most of the work in    
 Hastings came from fishing. From the  
 end of the last century tourism became
 the most important occupation. This   
 has also declined and light industry  
 has been developed. There are three   
 industrial estates which provide work.
  Other work is in services such as    
 shops, banks, schools, hospitals and  
 catering.                             
  Less than half the people in Hastings
 are employed but this is partly       
 because of the high proporyion of     
 retired people in the population.     
 Hastings would like to attract more   
 industries especially those connecte  
 with science and technology.
