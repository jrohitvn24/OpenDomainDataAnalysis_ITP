		<title>18DUNSTER SCHOOL 1</title>
		<content> In 1842 a Methodist preacher, Mr.     
 William Moore, died bequeathing Â£800  
 to endow a Wesleyan day school in     
 Dunster. This school, built in 1825 in
 Mill Lane was the first day school in 
 the Exeter District. The school was   
 rebuilt in 1853 and provided education
 for 40 children.                      
 By the mid 19th century there were two
 dame schools in the village. It was   
 not until 1861 that a school          
 professing to teach reading, writing  
 and religious instruction to boys and 
 girls of the parish was found to exist
 in Dunster. The school was supported  
 chiefly by H.F. Luttrell, the Lord of 
 the Manor.
