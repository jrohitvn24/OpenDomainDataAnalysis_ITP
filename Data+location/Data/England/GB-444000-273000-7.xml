		<title>07The Family 2.</title>
		<content>  In most families in the area the lady
 of the family usually does all the    
 cooking and preparation of food for   
 the rest of the family. This is done  
 in the kitchen of the house and there 
 are usually three meals a day to be   
 prepared.                             
  The first meal of the day is         
 breakfast which usually consists of a 
 cereal and toast with either tea or   
 coffee to drink.Sometimes the meal is 
 a "traditional English breakfast"     
 which consists of bacon and eggs which
 have been fried.                      
  The family is not always together for
 the lunchtime meal as the children are
 at school and the man of the house is 
 usually at work and lunch is eaten at 
 these places.The family gets together 
 again in the evening and the lady of  
 the house prepares an evening meal but
 this is not always eaten as a family. </content>
