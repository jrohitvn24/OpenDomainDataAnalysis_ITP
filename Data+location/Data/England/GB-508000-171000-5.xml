 Most of the houses in the Feltham area
 were built before or after the First  
 World War. Many are the same as the   
 one that I live in e.g. terrace       
 houses. This is where four or more    
 houses have been built together. When 
 they were first built at the turn of  
 the century they only cost between    
 Â£295 and Â£595 depending on the size.  
 The present price for these same      
 houses is between Â£38000 and Â£48000.  
 Some of the houses have three bedrooms
 whereas others only have two.         
 Also,some have their bathrooms        
 downstairs  but the majority like mine
 have them upstairs.                   
 Over the last three or four years some
 new town houses have been built on a  
 new estate called Brookside,this was  
 once fields with horses in them.
