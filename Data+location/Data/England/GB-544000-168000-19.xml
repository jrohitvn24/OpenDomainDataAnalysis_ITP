		<title>19"40-40"-a childrens' game.</title>
		<content>Choose a tree or post as a base.One    
player is "it".He closes his eyes and  
counts to forty while the others       
hide.When he has counted to forty,he   
shouts,"Coming,ready or not." No       
players should be behind the base or   
next to it.The person who is"it"then   
goes to look for the other players.They
have to get to the base without the    
person who is "it" seeing them.        
Immediately a person who is not "it"   
touches the base he shouts,"Forty-forty
save myself."The person who is "it"    
runs back to the base if he sees       
someone,touches it and shouts,"Forty-  
forty I see...."(naming the person     
who has been seen.). The last player   
has to try to get back  to the base    
without being seen and shout,"Forty-   
forty save all." If he suceeds then    
the person who was "it" is "it" again.
