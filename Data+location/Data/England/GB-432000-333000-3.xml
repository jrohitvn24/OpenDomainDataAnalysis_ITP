		<content> Jehovah's Witnesses go to meetings    
 every Tuesday. The Elders are         
 responsible for leading our service.  
   We sing songs about Jesus and God.  
 We go round to people's houses in     
 small groups and tell them about our  
 religion.                             
   The Sikhs' religious building id    
 called a Gurdwara.  Before we go in we
 have to take off our shoes and cover  
 our heads with a handkerchief or      
 turban, then we wash our hands.  The  
 Guru, our holy man, sits in a special 
 place and reads the holy book, the    
 Guru Granth Sahib.  We listen to the  
 reading and pray.  Ladies sit on one  
 side of the carpet and men on the     
 other side.
