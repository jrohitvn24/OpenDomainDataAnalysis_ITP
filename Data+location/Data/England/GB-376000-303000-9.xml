		<content> A section of the main Inter-City route
 between Shrewsbury and Wolverhampton  
 runs through the area studied.It runs 
 parallel to the A464(T).The line is   
 double track and provides a regular   
 passenger service between Shrewsbury  
 (and through to Mid Wales)and the link
 at Wolverhampton with the Inter-City  
 trains to Euston.                     
  There is one station in the area and 
 that is at Cosford.This was opened as 
 a halt not long after the R.A.F.camp  
 was opened to provide a service for   
 servicemen travelling by train.Today  
 local stopping trains call at the     
 station every   2   hours whilst      
 Inter-City trains pass straight       
 through.Over 85% of the passengers    
 using the station today are servicemen
 10% are pupils attending schools and  
 colleges in Telford or Wolverhampton. 
 Frieght trains also use the line.     </content>
