		<title>03RIVER LYNHER</title>
		<content>      The{river Lynher}winds its way   
 across the area towards its junction  
 with the{Tamar at Saltash,}creating a 
 deep valley.                          
      At{Newbridge,}the river is about 
{20 metres wide, 50 centimetres deep   
 and contains many large stones,       
 pebbles and undergrowth.  It is fast  
 flowing with many strong currents.    
      In the past the river water was  
 used to power several mills.  At      
{Frogwell,}the mill leat still exists, 
 but the flour mill containing an      
 undershot wheel was destroyed in 1950 
 since it was unsafe.  Water power was 
 also used at{Newton}and{Newbridge.    
      Nowadays, the river is used for  
{fishing and canoeing,}mainly by the   
 Liskeard Angling Club and Callington  
 Comprehensive School. It also marks   
 the{parish boundary}between Callington
 and St.Ive.                           </content>
