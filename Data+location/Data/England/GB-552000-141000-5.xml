  Before they close the barrier they   
 have to warn the Police, the County   
 Council, the N.F.U. and Lord De       
 L'Isle's farm manager. They give them 
 12 hours warning. They can tell how   
 high the water is getting because they
 have computers and a control room at  
 Leigh. There are three gates in the   
 barrier,and two are generally shut.   
 There is a big embankment of 1Km to   
 stop the flood water spilling over    
 onto the Tonbridge side. There is a   
 railway track nearby and they had to  
 build a high bank called a{berm}to    
 protect the railway track.
