		<title>05Churches in Hungerford.</title>
		<content>   St.Lawrence's Church of England is  
 the largest church in Hungerford.     
 Founded in 1108 by a Norman Abbot, it 
 collapsed in 1811 and was rebuilt in  
 in 1888.Many older monuments survived 
 and can still be seen today .The      
 windows are of stained glass; a       
 replacement would take between 6      
 months and a year to complete.        
   Every Sunday there are four services
 and a Sunday School.Special services  
 held annually include the Christingle 
 at Christmas,the Harvest Festival in  
 in  the autumn and the Constable      
 Service held just after Easter.       
   Hungerford also has a Methodist     
 Chapel , a United Reform Church       
 and a Roman Catholic Church.Christians
 from the different denominations do   
 have regular contact with each other.
