		<content>The policeman for the villages of      
Hackleton and Denton lives in the      
police house at Hackleton.His "Beat"   
includes 10 other villages.            
In addition to performing the normal   
duties of an officer of the law he     
makes sure that all the children know  
who he is despite covering such a      
large area.He visits each of the 7     
schools in his villages at least once  
and often many more times in the year. 
During a recent visit to Denton school 
some children asked about crime in the 
area and were given this information:- 
In 1984 4 cars were stolen 30 cars had 
property stolen from them (mainly      
petrol) while 32 houses were broken    
into and 21 other buildings were       
entered.He said most of the houses were
entered during the day when they were  
empty but on the whole we were very    
law abiding.                           </content>
