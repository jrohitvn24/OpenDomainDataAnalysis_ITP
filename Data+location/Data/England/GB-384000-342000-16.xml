		<title>16A Playground,Stoke</title>
		<content>  The Adventure Playground was built in
1973.The original idea was put forward 
by Mrs Redmond.The 'Adventure' as it is
called by the locals was built on the  
filled in Newcastle canal.It used to be
a dump but parents cleared it up.It was
built because there was no where for   
the children to play.                  
  The Adventure is paid for in two     
ways,by the Hanley Youth Project and by
the local community.The helpers have to
be trained.The leader came into school 
to talk to us about the Adventure.He   
thought more money should be spent on  
childrens play areas.                  
  The playground has got monkey bars,  
big concrete pipes,a B.M.X. course,a   
slide and a wooden frame with ropes.   
  There is also a hut where parents    
play bingo and pool.                   
  Every year there is a bonfire party.A
really big bonfire is built.           </content>
