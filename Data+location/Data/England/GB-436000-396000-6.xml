		<content>{Wentworth}is a very small village with
 few shops. One shop accomadates a lady
 called{Sue Hunt.}Sue Hunt is a qualifi
 ed{wood turner}and has her own work sh
 op at the back of her house. We went  
 there and had lunch in her kitchen.Th 
 en she showed us  into her{workshop}to
 see how she turned the wood. In her wo
 rkshop there are two great big machin 
 es which she turns the wood on.The    
 machines each have a large metal plate
 which spins round very fast the wood  
 fastens on to this plate and when the 
 plate spins she can carve the wood    
 .After showing us how she did this we 
 went into the{shop}to see all the     
 things she had made. There were three 
 lovely{clocks}which were all differe  
 nt sizes. There was also a small tea_ 
 pot,six eggcups and a sugar bowl. She 
 also makes frames for pictures and mat
 ing frames for photoes.               </content>
