		<title>12GOOSTREY SCHOOL _ GAMES</title>
		<content>    At playtime at Goostrey School many
 different games are played. One of the
 favourites is 'ELASTIC'. Two people   
 stand facing each other with a loop of
 elastic stretched between them. They  
 start with it round their ankles and  
 increase the height as the game       
 progresses. Several other children    
 take turns doing a series of jumps    
 onto or in between the elastic.When a 
 jump is done wrongly that child takes 
 over holding the elastic.             
    More traditional games include     
 various forms of chasing, informal    
 football, skipping and 'Pig in the    
 middle'. The blank wall is used for   
 throwing and catching games. 'DONKEY' 
 involves throwing the ball at the wall
 and jumping over it before it bounces.
 Any child failing is given'D','O','N' 
 etc. in turn and after 'Y' is 'OUT'.
