		<title>02Star Manor Militaires 2</title>
		<content>    The Militaires imitate soldiers    
 marching to a military band. They have
 to practise every day of the week.    
 The majorettes march in complicated   
 patterns twirling batons and flags.The
 band play drums and bugles.           
                                       
 They travel in two coaches, one for   
 the majorettes and the other for their
 parents. It sometimes seems the       
 whole area is involved.               
                                       
 Children joined the Manor Militaires  
 because they liked the idea of beating
 drums or girls joined to twirl batons 
 and flags. Others had seen majorettes 
 and marching bands on television and  
 thought it would be exciting.
