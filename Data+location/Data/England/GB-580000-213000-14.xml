		<content> We interviewed an old lady who has    
 lived in Witham for 81 yrs.She was    
 born in Grove Cottages and has lived  
 in Church St. since 1939.When she went
 there, there were no bathrooms and    
 they had coal fires. There are still a
 few of the old shops left,but there   
 were more shops then than there are   
 now.You could get every thing you     
 wanted in Witham.Some of the Roads are
 the same now, but Witham has grown a  
 lot bigger now a days.                
 She went to All Saints Church School  
 (now Howbridge CofE Junior School).The
 other schools were the Board Schools  
 in Maldon Road and Chipping Hill.There
 werea lot more fields then than there 
 are now. There is just one person left
 who she has known all her life -  and 
 that is her brother.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
