		<content>In Cranbrook there are quite a few     
leisure activities for the young and   
old.Down by one of the estates called  
the FRYTHE,there is a fair sized       
swimming pool which requires a season  
ticket or 50p to get in for two hours. 
For the older people,there are bowling 
facilities,just by the primary school  
and a few climbing frames and swings   
etc on the ball field,just opposite the
school.For children at Cranbrook       
Grammar school there are two squash    
courts and anyone who is interested can
become a member and there are different
leagues depending on how good you are. 
At Angley school there are badminton   
sessions and just down the road in     
Sissinghurst,a tennis court.You can    
easily obtain membership and take      
lessons.There is a youth club in the   
youth wing of Angley school and        
sometimes discos are held there.       </content>
