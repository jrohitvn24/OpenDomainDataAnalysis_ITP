		<title>08HOME LIFE: BANK COTTAGE</title>
		<content>     We enjoyed the owner's accent as  
 he told us about his life, all of     
 which he has spent in Bank Cottage,   
 Chillerton. He has one daughter.      
     Besides a few crops which grow in 
 a little field, his land produces     
 grass and weeds. He uses muck and     
 fertiliser spreaders and a combine    
 harvester.                            
     The owner keeps cows but he       
 is not too happy about the number of  
 people who use his land as a play     
 area. He would like to see a          
 more frequent bus service for the     
 people of Chillerton who have so few  
 local shops to cater for their needs. 
 He, himself, has a car but it is      
 not brand new.
