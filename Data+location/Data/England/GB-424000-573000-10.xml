our area, is a mixed farm of 368 acres.
here are 16 fields,14 are used for     
crops(oil seed rape, turnips, wheat and
barley) and 2 fields are given over to 
cattle.They have 3,000 hens which lay  
2,000 eggs every day.The farm is highly
mechanised.There are 2 combine         
harvesters, 6 tractors,a seed drill,4  
trailers,a bailer,a grass cutter and   
turner and a fork lift.The most        
valuable crop is the oil seed rape     
which is processed into vegetable oil. 
The cattle, when fat, are sent to the  
farm's own abbatoir.There are only a   
few trees on the farm, but hedges      
separate the fields.The oldest building
is sandstone.New sheds and byres are   
built with breeze blocks and metal     
girders.They employ 2 full time workers
