{GILBERDYKE.}

 The villagers of Gilberdyke are able  
 to participate in a surprisingly large
 range of formal and informal          
 activities, either organised by the   
 villagers themselves or as part of    
 larger national bodies. The following 
 list was compiled after discussion    
 with the children of the school who   
 were able to give the names of the    
 clubs, the venue and day/days upon    
 which the club takes place; knowing   
 that parents, brothers, sisters,      
 grandparents and friends all make use 
 of these facilities.
