		<title>15Life in Winston Today.(ctd).</title>
		<content> Undobtedly this is a great success,   
 for tennis is by far the most popular 
 participant sport for Winston         
 residents, with other sports far      
 behind e.g. the jogging craze has only
 two adherents.                        
 Winston's major change in recent years
 has been a gradual one.  Whilst a     
 housing development, Highcliffe Edge, 
 has appeared at the western end of the
 village, other buildings have changed 
 their use or have been rebuilt to     
 harmonize with their original design  
 and that of the surrounding buildings.
 The Church Mews has been constructed  
 into houses from barns; The           
 "Bridgewater Arms", (the only public  
 house) has been converted from the old
 village school.    The original public
 house is now a dwelling house and the 
 old post office is now a bungalow.
