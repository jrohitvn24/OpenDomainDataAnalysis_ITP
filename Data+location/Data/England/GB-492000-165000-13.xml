		<title>13CHANGES IN FASHION</title>
		<content> Some of the changes Sunningdale people
 mentioned included the fashions and   
 attitudes people have now and had 50  
 years ago.When asked about old fashion
 ,one lady said that clothes and hair- 
 styles used to be much neater and     
 tidier and that people used to carry  
 themselves better.She did not go into 
 detail about the actual styles but    
 said that nowadays too many people are
 round-shouldered and apparently are   
 not able to stand up straight.It was  
 also thought that people used to look 
 much happier.Todays discontent was    
 blamed on too many material           
 possessions and a spiritual vacuum.It 
 was said that Sunningdale used to be  
 tidy village but now it is being      
 buried under a mound of discarded     
 rubbish.Another observation was that  
 before World War 2 most adults wore   
 hats and gloves.                      </content>
