		<content> MELBOURNE PARISH CHURCH IS ONE OF THE 
 MOST BEAUTIFUL HISTORICAL BUILDINGS IN
 THE TOWN.I GO THERE EVERY SUNDAY AS I 
 AM AN ACOLYTE,THAT IS A BOY WHO       
 CARRIES A CANDLE FOR THE VICAR.THE    
 CHURCH IS DEDICATED TO ST. MICHAEL AND
 ST.MARY.IT WAS BUILT IN 1133 BY THE   
 BISHOP OF CARLISLE.YOU ARE PROBABLY   
 WONDERING WHY THIS BISHOP BUILT A     
 CHURCH IN A SMALL VILLAGE OF ABOUT 200
 PEOPLE.WELL,THE SCOTS KEPT COMING DOWN
 TO ATTACK CARLISLE AND SO HE MOVED    
 SOUTH OF THE RIVER TRENT FOR SAFETY.IT
 IS A VERY LARGE NORMAN CHURCH,IN FACT 
 A MINI-CATHEDRAL,FIT FOR A BISHOP.IT  
 IS SAID TO HAVE THE FINEST NORMAN     
 DOORWAY AT THE WEST END AND IS THE    
 ONLY PARISH CHURCH IN ENGLAND TO HAVE 
 A CLERESTORY THAT CAN BE WALKED AROUND
 COMPLETELY.THE FONT IS FROM THE       
 12TH.CENTURY.THE PRESENT VICAR IS THE 
 REVEREND FREDERICK ROSS.              </content>
