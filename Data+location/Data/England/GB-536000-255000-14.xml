		<content>  In Toft and Comberton many discos are
 held all through the year.Usually the 
 Meridian Primary School, has a disco  
 once or twice a year,in the school    
 hall.                                 
  For the older children there was a   
 youth club at the Village College.At  
 the youth club they sometimes hold    
 discos.At discos they sell sweets,    
 chocolates and drinks.                
  The tickets for a disco usually cost 
 about 75p.                            
  For birthdays or partys you can hire 
 the village hall and also disc jockeys
 to play the records for you.          
  A 4th year privilege at the end of   
 the term is to have a disco in the    
 school hall but this year (1985) the  
 4th years watched a video of SUPERMAN 
 III but the 3rd years and some 2nd    
 years watched it as well!
