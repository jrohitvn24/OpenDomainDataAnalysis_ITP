		<content> I get up at 7:30 every morning. I have
 my breakfast with my parents and we   
 set off from home around 8:30 in the  
 car. Our school starts at 9.00 a.m.   
 and finishes at 3:30 p.m. When I go   
 home I have my tea and watch          
 childrens' programmes on T.V. They    
 usually finish at 6:00 p.m. If I have 
 homework it usually takes about three 
 quarters of an hour. Sometimes around 
 7:00 p.m. we go out to play for an    
 hour. Then I have a bath and we have  
 supper. We have biscuits or buttered  
 toast and a drink of hot chocolate.   
 Then I get undressed and go to bed.
