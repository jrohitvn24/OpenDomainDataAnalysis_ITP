		<content> St. Cuthbert's Church was built around
 the year 883 for the first time. It   
 was rebuilt around the year 1735. The 
 only link with the gothic past is an  
 old buttress. St. Cuthbert's Church is
 in the parish of North Meols.There is 
 a lych gate at the front entrance     
 where two stone gate-posts once       
 were.The posts now stand between the  
 Hesketh Arms public house and the     
 parish hall.The contents of the Church
 are described in sequence, starting at
 the left of the main entrance and     
 proceeding clock-wise.The small       
 winding staircase in the south-west   
 corner leads to the gallery and upper 
 stages of the tower. Immediately to   
 the right is the eighteenth century { 
{STONE FONT}with its original wooden   
 cover.On either side are two chairs   
 alloted to the Member of Parliament   
                                       </content>
