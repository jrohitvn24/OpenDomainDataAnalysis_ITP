		<title>06FARMING  CUCKFIELD RURAL</title>
		<content> Most of the farmers in the area are   
 tenents of large estates or investment
 companies.Many of the holdings consist
 of several small farms amalgamated    
 i.e. Sidnye,Mizbrooks and Collins     
 farms, owned by an estate but tenented
 to a father and son as a 400acre mixed
 farm. One of the exceptions is Upper  
 and Lower Sparks farm,170 acres of    
 arable land,worked single handed by   
 the owner, the farmhouses having been 
 sold.It is common to sell the often   
 historic farm house with a large      
 garden as a private home,to raise     
 capital,and for the farmer to live in 
 a farm cottage.These become vacant as 
 the number of workers falls,due to    
 increased mechanisation and increased 
 labour costs, coupled with a poor     
 return in relation to capital         
 invested.
