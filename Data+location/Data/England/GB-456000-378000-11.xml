		<content>    There are over 60 uniformed        
 officers stationed in Worksop. This   
 does not include C.I.D., traffic and  
 communications personnel who would    
 bring the total up to about 100.      
    For a market town, Worksop has a   
 fairly high crime rate. The main      
 crimes are theft from cars, vandalism,
 shoplifting and burlary. Recently     
 Worksop has had a large number of     
 burglaries to dwelling houses. There  
 has been an incident which resulted in
 a man's death and a serious assault on
 young children on the outskirts of    
 Clumber Park.                         
    The Police find Worksop townspeople
 very friendly and fair-minded, though 
 they would like to improve their      
 relations with the public.            
 Crime prevention officers visit all   
 the schools in the area.
