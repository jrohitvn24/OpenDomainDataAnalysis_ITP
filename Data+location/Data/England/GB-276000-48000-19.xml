		<title>19E.ALLINGTON TABLE TENNIS</title>
		<content> Five years ago on one of our local    
 farms an old granary loft above a pig 
 house was converted into a table      
 tennis room, with space also for darts
 and pool.  As there was little in the 
 area for the youngsters to do in the  
 way of organised games, the farmer    
 invited them to join his own 3 sons   
 and daughter for regular Friday       
 evening "club nights".  Soon a        
 thriving sports club sprang to life   
 with children receiving regular       
 coaching in table tennis and, in fact 
 a number became so proficient that    
 they now play in the South Hams table 
 tennis league and are doing well.  The
 enthusiasm for table tennis spread to 
 other locals, so that we now have a   
 number of farmers and their friends   
 who also participate in league table  
 tennis.                               
                                       </content>
