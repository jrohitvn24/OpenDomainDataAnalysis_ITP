		<content>    The area is sparsely settled, and  
 there are, therefore, few houses in   
 the block. Two or three cottages and  
 one farm in{West Torrington}possibly  
 contain 17th century work, but have   
 had later additions or rebuilding.    
 Some isolated farm houses probably    
 date from the late 18th century       
 Enclosures, but much of the housing   
 dates from the 19th century. This     
 varies between large farm-houses and a
 vicarage to small labourers' cottages.
 Most of these have been enlarged,     
 amalgamated and modernised, whether   
 they are tied cottages or individually
 owned. There are a few recent         
 bungalows in{West Torrington,}and some
 council housing. There are 2 council  
 houses in{Bleasby Moor,}and one recent
 house at{East Torrington.}
