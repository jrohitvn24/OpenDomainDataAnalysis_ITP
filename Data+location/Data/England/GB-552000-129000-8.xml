 Public houses play an important part  
 in the lifestyles of the over 18's of 
 the 1980's.As well as drinking alcohol
 people visit them to meet friends and 
 business acquaintances, sometimes to  
 listen to live music and increasingly 
 to eat meals.Family rooms and gardens 
 enable children to accompany adults.  
 For teenagers particularly, fashion   
 styles which vary in shape and colour 
 each year, discos for modern dancing  
 and the pop culture are an important  
 way of life and topic of conversation 
 A national chart shows the most       
 popular records each week.Celebration 
 meals are enjoyed in restaurants or as
 dinner parties at home, mostly eaten  
 in the evening. Some people gamble by 
 forecasting the results of horse races
 or football matches and in this way   
 money is wagered in a game of chance. </content>
