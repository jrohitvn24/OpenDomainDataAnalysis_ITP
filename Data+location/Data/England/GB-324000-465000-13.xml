		<title>13A FISHERMAN</title>
		<content> Mr. Edmondson is an oyster farmer. He 
 used to do shrimping and fishing but  
 doesn't anymore as there are not      
 sufficient fish or shrimps left to    
 make it profitable. He enjoys his     
 lifestyle. His house isabout 800 years
 old and is situated on the  coast     
 road. When he first lived there forty 
 years ago the family had to get their 
 water from a well in the garden. The  
 house has now been modernised. He     
 grows                                 
 all his own vegetables. He drives to  
 Barrow for shopping. He chooses to    
 live where he does because of his work
 and because it is peaceful.
