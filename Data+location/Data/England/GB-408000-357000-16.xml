     Warslow village hall is used by   
quite a number of people.  All village 
meetings are held there.               
     The youth club, which was started 
in 1977 is held there every Monday     
evening.  About 20-30 people from the  
age of 9 to 16 attend each week and    
play table tennis or snooker, buy a    
soft drink or just talk to their       
friends.                               
     Bingo sessions are held on        
alternate Wednesdays.                  
     Warslow Silver Band practise every
Sunday from 7p.m. until 9p.m. in the   
village hall.  There are 11 members and
they play at local Wakes and Galas and 
in local pubs.                         
     In 1985 all the windows and       
curtains were replaced with new ones   
and the building was decorated.
