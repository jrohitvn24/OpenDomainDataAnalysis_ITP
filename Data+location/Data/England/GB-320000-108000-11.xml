		<title>11Getting around N.Upottery</title>
		<content>   Our nearest shopping town is        
 Honiton,and for this we give each     
 other lifts,since there is no         
 satisfactory bus-service.Twice a week 
 a private bus firm runs a service into
 and out of Taunton and there is a     
 daily post-bus that runs through the  
 village.The latter is of little       
 use,since we are its first port of    
 call before a long,long string of     
 villages on its meandering course back
 to Honiton.Private transport is       
 essential if you live in this area.   
   The main lanes are well kept,though 
 they can be perilously narrow ,winding
 or steep;we are all extremely         
 courteous to each other about backing 
 to the nearest field entrance when we 
 meet face to face.Especially when one 
 of us is a milk tanker or a large     
 piece of farm machinery!And we have   
 the frequent problem of fog.          </content>
