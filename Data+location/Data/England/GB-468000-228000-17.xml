		<title>17PADBURY - TRAVELLING SHOPS</title>
		<content> Due to the decline in shops and       
 services within a village and the     
 generally poor quality of public      
 transport to nearby shopping centres, 
 there has , in recent years, been an  
 upsurge in travelling shops and       
 services. One mobile shop calls 3     
 times a week, another one calls once a
 week. The fresh fish van comes every  
 Wednesday, the baker 2 or 3 times a   
 week. The fish and chip van calls on  
 Monday at teatime and on Friday in the
 evening. The icecream man calls at    
 least once a day. Milk is delivered 5 
 days a week and newspapers 7. The     
 paper boy will also call to collect   
 your paper money so you need have no  
 direct contact with the newsagent.    
 There are also 2 free papers delivered
 weekly. The Library van calls once a  
 fortnight, thus village life is not as
 isolated as it might appear.          </content>
