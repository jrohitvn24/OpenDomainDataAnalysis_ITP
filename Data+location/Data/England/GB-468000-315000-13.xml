 The majority of children have their   
 own bedroom.All the children we       
 interviewed had the use of a bike and 
 only 3% had to share a bike.The       
 majority of children share a T.V. with
 the rest of the family,though more    
 children had their own radio.Cameras  
 and binoculars were mostly shared with
 the rest of the family,but more       
 children had their own cameras than   
 binoculars. Only 12% of children      
 didn't have a watch.                  </content>
