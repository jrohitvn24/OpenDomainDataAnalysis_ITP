		<title>15TRANSPORT HALWELL&amp;MORELEIGH</title>
		<content> Moreleigh has no bus service.  The    
 nearest Western National Service runs 
 through Halwell (on Tuesdays and      
 Fridays) to Kingsbridge - and thence  
 to Plymouth - or to Totnes, where     
 services to Paignton, Torquay and     
 Exeter connect.  There is a railway   
 station at Totnes and trains run to   
 Exeter,London and all over Great      
 Britain.  There are a privately run   
 and a Western National school bus     
 which may be used in term time by     
 adults.                               
 A proposed by-pass round Halwell has  
 ben shelved due, in part, to the      
 economic clime.  At peak periods of   
 the holiday season 8,000 cars and 500 
 lorries over 3 tons have been logged  
 passing through the village each day -
 this traffic affecting directly only 6
 houses and the Inn, but making        
 pedestrian crossing hazardous.        </content>
