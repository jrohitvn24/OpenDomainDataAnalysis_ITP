		<title>20THE NEXT DOMESDAY</title>
		<content> Throughout this project we (the       
 pupils) have been talking about how   
 interesting it would have been to be  
 able to look through 'Domesday's'of   
 the past inorder to compare them with 
 our lives, employment, entertainment, 
 etc today. We all hope that the       
 project will be repeated at regular   
 intervals in the future for this very 
 purpose. The young people of Feltham  
 are very fortunate in that there are  
 plenty of opportunities available of  
 both a social and economic nature.    
 With there being so much employment   
 many young people have a lot of money 
 to spend on clothes,cars, motor-bikes,
 music, etc.                           
 Finally Mr.Phillips would like to     
 thank Arvinder, Colin, Sarah, Kevin,  
 Leigh, Selina, Sally, Paul, Roger,    
 Debs, Celia, Richard, Rachel and Nik  
 for their help.                       </content>
