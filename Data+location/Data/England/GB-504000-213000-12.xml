		<title>12TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> Our school day at Flamstead begins at 
 9.00am when the whistle is blown.We   
 then go into school and take our coats
 off and line up for assembly.The      
 assembly is taken by Mr.Hickling or   
 Mr.Bates.After assembly the juniors   
 usually do maths until break at       
 10.40am when we go into the field if  
 the weather is good.The infants have  
 milk at this time.After break we do   
 English until lunchtime.Most children 
 stay for school lunch.We have a choice
 of about 3 menus and have our lunch in
 the assembly hall.In the afternoon we 
  do all sorts of different things,such
 as topic work,swimming or games.We go 
 home at 3.15pm but we have clubs after
 school like gym club and pottery club.
 Older children go to school in Hemel  
 Hempstead and don't get home until    
 4.15pm.
