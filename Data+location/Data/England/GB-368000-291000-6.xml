		<title>06Bridgnorth By-Pass</title>
		<content> The Bridgnorth by-pass was opened in  
 1985 by the Minister of Transport Mrs.
 Linda Chalker.  Two of St. John's     
 pupils held the tape for Mrs. Chalker 
 to cut when the opening was performed.
 The road crosses the river and runs   
 under the Severn Valley Railway taking
 traffic away from the congested centre
 of the historic town of Bridgnorth.   
 Planned for nearly 50 years, the      
 project was commenced in 1983 and     
 finished 6 months ahead of schedule.  
 The planners say that it will take a  
 lot of north bound traffic away from  
 the centre of Bridgnorth and help to  
 preserve the ancient buildings which  
 might otherwise suffer damage.  The   
 resident engineer was Sabah Shamash   
 who moved from Swansea to supervise   
 this project.
