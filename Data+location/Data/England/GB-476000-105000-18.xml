		<content> BRITISH BULLDOG - Any number can play.
 the game is usually played in a field 
 or a playground.Players line up at one
 end of their chosen playing area and  
 have to get to the other end.Trying to
 stop them will be,at first,one boy or 
 girl.On a chosen signal,the players   
 will try to rush past the player who  
 is "it".If he or she touches any      
 player,then that player has to join   
 hands with the person in the middle.  
 Eventually,there is a huge chain of   
 players in the middle trying to catch 
 the few survivors.The winner is the   
 last player who has not been caught.He
 then tries to trick or rush his way   
 past all the other players.           
                                       
 A variant of this is that you have to 
 be lifted of the ground to be caught  
 by the middle players,who,when they   
 have touched you,may release hands.   </content>
