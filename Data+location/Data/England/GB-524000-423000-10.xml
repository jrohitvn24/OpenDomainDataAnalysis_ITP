		<title>10ATTITUDES IN KEYINGHAM AREAS</title>
		<content> Unemployment is a major concern,      
 formany years the effects of          
 mechanized farming has been felt with 
 fewer and fewer local people being    
 needed. Now trades that some of these 
 people had turned to have also been   
 cut causing have also been cut causing
 large unemployment. Everyone has been 
 effected skilled and unskilled,       
 qualified and unqualified. It would   
 now seem something we have to live    
 with and adjust to and perhaps change 
 our attitudes to as it still regarded 
 by some as a stigma to be without a   
 job. Being a largely farming area,    
 changing methods of crop spraying,    
 removal of hedgrows and trees, stubble
 burning, subsidised crop production - 
 leading to over population of certain 
 crops (grain mountains), intensive or 
 battery farming of animals, all these 
 and more are giving cause for concern,</content>
