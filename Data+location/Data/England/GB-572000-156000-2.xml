		<title>02 LIVING BY THE RIVER MEDWAY</title>
		<content>                                       
     It is nice to be living near the  
{River Medway}because there are lots of
 things you can see and learn. Near the
 locks is the{Malta Inn}which is also a
 reastaurant.                          
     Opposite the Malta Inn is         
{Allington Castle.}The{locks}along the 
 river still work and next to them is  
 the sluice gate for the locks which is
 run on electric power.                
     Most people on a weekend go along 
 the river in their boats and adults   
 and children go fishing.The river     
 looks dirty, but it is mostly mud as  
 there are few factories here now.You  
 can get to the other side of the river
 by the bridge next to the sluice and  
 you walk over the lock.
