		<title>19THE LOCAL DIALECT</title>
		<content> The people in the area seem to have   
 their own language,which can be       
 difficult to understand to any new    
 person moving into the area.The people
 who talk in this strange language are 
 locally known as 'Cowinheeaders',but  
 nowadays 'Cowinheeaders' are becoming 
 quite a rarity,as more and more people
 move into the area.The present        
 generation no longer pick up these    
 local words and so do not carry on the
 traditional language.So in the future 
 will this strange language disappear  
 forever,only to be read about?        
   Here are some examples:             
   {GAWP - TO STARE.}                  
   {MOITHERED - WORRIED ANXIOUS.}      
   {KRONKED - SETTLED DOWN. }          
   {JADED - BORED OR WORN OUT. }       
   {WHEW - MILL WHISTLE. }             
   {TWINED AS A WASP - VERY ANNOYED.}  
                                       </content>
