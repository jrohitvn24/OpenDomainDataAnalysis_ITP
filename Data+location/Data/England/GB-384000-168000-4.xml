		<title>04COPENACRE NEAR CORSHAM</title>
		<content>  Copenacre is owned by the Ministry of
 Defence. It is situated on the A4 in  
 between Corsham and Rudloe. I have    
 often wondered what it was and when I 
 visited there I was quite surprised at
 the size of it.There are lots of      
 tunnels under ground and the main part
 are called Spring Quarry, Monks Park  
 and Hartham. Copenacre is a Royal Navy
 store depot. They store mostly        
 electronics and they send them to     
 ships. If it is an emergency they     
 could send supplies to a ship within  
 24 hours. The new tunnels are not the 
 only tunnels in Copenacre because the 
 old ones are still there. Copenacre   
 packs goods that they receive and     
 sometimes they could get a package as 
 big as a living room. Everything that 
 goes to the ships goes by road. The   
 emergency exits have 192 steps.
