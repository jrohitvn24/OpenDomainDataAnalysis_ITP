 Education                             
                                       
 Ashridge House is now a privately     
 owned and run College which has a high
 reputation and trains managers in     
 Business Studies.                     
 The only other Educational institution
 in the block is the Aldbury Village   
 School which educates children from   
 the age of 5 years until eleven years 
 when the majority go on to Tring      
 School for their Secondary Education. 
 Some children in the block travel to  
 other schools for a private education 
 in Berkhamsted or in Tring.
