		<content> Earlswood Village has its own village 
 hall, where local clubs  and societies
 meet, three public houses and a very  
 active Methodist Church. The Earlswood
 Lakes have provided the area with many
 leisure activities since they were    
 created in the early nineteenth       
 century.In the 1880's, with the advent
 of the bicycle, people used to cycle  
 miles to spend "a day out" at         
 Earlswood, known then as the{         
{Scarborough of the Midlands}There were
 seven Tea gardens in the village and  
 an Edwardian Dance Hall at the Red    
 Lion public house.                    
  The early twentieth century brought  
 the Warwickshire Railway line giving  
 people the opportunity to travel      
 further.Housing, an increase in       
 population and the motor car brought  
 changes in the area.Today the building
 of the{M42}will no doubt bring more.  </content>
