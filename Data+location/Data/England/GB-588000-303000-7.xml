		<title>07FOOTPATHS OF ASHILL</title>
		<content> Ashill has{eleven footpaths}or{bridle-
{ways}and these provide the few places 
 that people can walk away from the    
 metalled roads. The footpaths have    
 lately been a source of contention    
 between some farmers and the people   
 who wish to walk them. They have been 
 largely unused for several years, but 
 the influx of retired people, and the 
 increase in people wishing to walk    
 them, led to a Parish Councillor      
 getting them all{signposted}where they
 leave the metalled roads, and         
 organising walks to ensure they remain
 in use. The footpaths are now being   
 used more frequently and the next plan
 is to put more markers across the     
 fields so they can be more easily     
 followed, these are needed where      
 fields have been put together         
 eliminating hedges and ditches the    
 footpaths previously followed.        </content>
