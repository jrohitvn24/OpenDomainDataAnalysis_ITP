		<title>17Farming in Saxilby Area</title>
		<content> Nearly the whole  Saxilby  area  given
 over  to agriculture is arable, mostly
 wheat,  with  barley,  oilseed   rape,
 peas, beans, and sugar beet also being
 grown. There are no uncultivated areas
 .  Partly  due to Government policies,
 the number of animals has reduced, esp
 dairy herds. There  is  only  1  dairy
 unit,  1  pig  unit  and  a  few  beef
 cattle. Three  farming  companies  own
 the  largest  acreage  and  there  are
 seven individual farmers. Each one has
 his own machinery  to  drill,  plough,
 spray,  and  harvest. Some cultivating
 and aerial spraying is contracted out.
 1985  has  been  one  of  the  wettest
 harvests  on  record.  There is also a
 seed  trial  unit  where  flower   and
 vegetable   seeds   are   tested   and
 experiments on  composts  are  carried
 out.  There  is  a  commercial nursery
 unit with glass houses.               </content>
