		<title>17HIGH HURSTWOOD SOCIAL LIFE 1</title>
		<content> Social life in High Hurstwood centres 
 round the Village Hall and Recreation 
 Ground which lie just to the South of 
 our block. Here there is a thriving   
 Cricket Club and Youth CLub with      
 membership of some 36 boys and girls  
 aged between l3 and 2l. There is a    
 monthly Whist Drive and elsewhere a   
 Scottish Dancing Group. The Hunt      
 frequently passes through the village 
 and the Joint Master of the Eridge and
 Southdown Foxhounds resides in the    
 area. High Hurstwood Women's Institute
 meets monthly in the Hall, providing  
 its 72 members with a choice of many  
 activities including craft and cookery
 classes, drama and the opportunity to 
 hear speakers on a wide variety of    
 subjects such as travel, local        
 history, art and music.
