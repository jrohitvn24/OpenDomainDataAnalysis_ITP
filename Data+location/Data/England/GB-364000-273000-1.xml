		<title>01The Cycling Proficiency Test</title>
		<content> Police Constable Cadwallader is one of
 our three local policemen. Each week  
 he gives up his lunch hour and comes  
 into school as our cycling instructor 
 for the proficiency test. Before we   
 had each lesson we had a talk about   
 what we were going to do that day     
 outside. On our first lesson we had   
 our bikes checked and a book given to 
 us about the highway code. When we    
 were on our bikes we were shown what  
 to do when on the road, like how to do
 a right_hand turn. We then had to     
 practise each new item in the         
 playground. Each day we tackled a new 
 sequence which would help us in the   
 test. The day before the test we went 
 round the course and had a practice   
 run. There was a written test to do   
 before we went on the road. All twelve
 of us passed the test.
