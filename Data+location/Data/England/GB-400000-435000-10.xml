		<content> much resentment,especially from older 
 people in the village,that local      
 opinion and benefit comes second to   
 the needs of the tourists.An example  
 of this is the plan to build a large  
 new car park for local people at the  
 bottom of the hill but they live at   
 the top of a very steep hill where    
 parking is reserved for tourists.     
 Street parking is necessarily         
 prohibited.Nobody loves the tourists. 
 One small boy said,"I can't find      
 anywhere to ride my bike."            
   Jobs in industry have almost        
 completely disappeared,causing the    
 young people to move away from        
{Haworth}in search of employment,whilst
 strangers come and go.As one local    
 said                                  
{-  Once when you walked out you knew  
{everybody,now you don't even bother   
{looking.}                             </content>
