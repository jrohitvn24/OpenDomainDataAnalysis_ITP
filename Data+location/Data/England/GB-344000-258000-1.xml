		<title>01WEST LEOMINSTER DISTRICT</title>
		<content>   This area, including outskirts of   
 Leominster, is predominantly rural,   
 with some housing - both private and  
 council - but is in the main sparsely 
 populated, with isolated cottages and 
 farmhouses and occasional hamlets     
 such as Cholstrey and Cobnash.        
   The agriculture consists of         
 pastureland, arable land and          
 orcharding.  The rivers Lugg and Arrow
 and Pinsley Brook flow through the    
 area.                                 
   Leisure pursuits are mainly rural.  
   The main occupation is farming,     
 although residents on the estates,    
 situated at the eastern edge, travel  
 to work in Leominster and Hereford.   
   There is a fair amount of           
 unemployment in the area.             
   Public transport is not very good,  
 relying almost entirely on private bus
 companies.                            </content>
