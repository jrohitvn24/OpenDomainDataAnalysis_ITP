 Local people are skilled at a variety 
 of arts and crafts, including         
 wine-making, needlework and           
 embroidery, pottery, flower arranging,
 painting in watercolours, sketching,  
 and in canework which includes re-    
 seating chairs. Yalding High Street   
 includes a blacksmith's shop and      
 forge; although no working horses     
 remain horses and ponies are kept for 
 leisure. The local blacksmith is of   
 high repute, having travelled to the  
 USA to demonstrate his skills. A      
 potter and a printer have premises    
 nearby. This block was surveyed and   
 researched by groups of children from 
 Yalding CE Primary School assisted by 
 parents and friends and with slides   
 kindly contributed by 2 villagers. The
 written work is by the Headmaster in  
 consultation with group leaders.      </content>
