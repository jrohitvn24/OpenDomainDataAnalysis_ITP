 There's a chip shop on the corner     
 And a Chinese down the road,          
 There's a market place also,          
 It is quite old.                      
 It opens on a Friday                  
 And Saturday too,                     
 There's a Presto's                    
 And a Woolworth's                     
 And a Music Box too.                  
 It's really quite strange,            
 The things you can do,                
 It has play parks,                    
 And town squares                      
 And Public loos.                      
 It has lots of shops                  
 It has churches too                   
 It's quite a nice place, for You.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
