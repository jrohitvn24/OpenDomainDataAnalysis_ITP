 Most of the land in our area is used  
 for farming, not housing. This is     
 mainly animal farming as the land is  
 quite hilly(251m at its highest point 
 not really suitable for planting      
 crops.We visited 6 farms in all making
 appointments by telephone with the    
 farmers. All 6 farms are owned by     
 their occupants, but 2 of them are    
 only smallholdings with a few animals 
 such as ducks and donkeys.None of the 
 farms grew crops, though many had     
 large gardens where they grew enough  
 vegetables for their family needs.Cows
 chickens,sheep and pigs are all kept  
 on the farms. Hagg Farm had 3 acres of
 land and was the smallest, being      
 really a smallholding. Hill Top Farm  
 was by far the largest with 95 acres.
