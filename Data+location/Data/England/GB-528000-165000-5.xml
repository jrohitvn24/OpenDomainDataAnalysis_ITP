		<title>05A DAY IN AN OFFICE</title>
		<content>We interviewed Mr.X who works in a     
solicitor's office locally.            
     Mr.X's office is about 15 minutes'
walk from home.  He works from 9.15 am 
to 5.15 pm.  Most of his work consists 
of typing, shorthand, dictaphone work, 
and making telephone calls.  He enjoys 
his work and finds it interesting bec- 
ause he deals with people, helping them
with their problems, and each day' the 
work varies tremendously.              
     With him in the office are one    
partner, two part-time secretaries, a  
clerk, and a cashier who comes in once 
a month.  The office equipment includes
a photocopier, manual typewriter, and a
private telephone exchange.            
     It appears to be quite a small    
office as most offices these days use  
computers and wordprocessors, or at    
least electronic typewriters.
