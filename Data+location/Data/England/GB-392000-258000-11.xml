		<title>11The History of Himbleton</title>
		<content>      Thomas Habingdon the 17th century
 Worcestershire historian said of      
 Himbleton "She is well watered - if   
 not too much in winter". He spoke of  
 Bow Brook and nearly 400 years later  
 she is still too well watered by the  
 floods of Bow Brook.                  
      The Church is dedicated to       
 St.Mary Magdalene. A small part of the
 south wall is 12th century but the    
 main buldding dates from the 14th and 
 following 4 cunturies. Until 1976     
 Himbleton had its own Vicar , but now 
 shares with Crowle and the Vicarage   
 was sold.                             
      Other antiquities are the        
 pack-horse bridge at Shell Ford and   
 nearby Shell Manor,Shell Mill and     
 farmhouse. There are many "black &amp;    
 white"buildings.                      
      The surrounding woods are the    
 remnants of Feckenham Forest.         </content>
