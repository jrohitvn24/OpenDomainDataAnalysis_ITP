		<title>14Change in The Shelsleys</title>
		<content>  Since the publication of the{Victoria
{County History}a more radical change  
 in the face of the countryside can not
 have taken place in any other century.
   Gone are the narrow, dusty lanes and
 farm workers' cottages. Gone too in   
 the last few years are most of the    
 fruit orchards and hop yards, to be   
 replaced by grazing and arable        
 farming. Small farms have long since  
 been absorbed into greater, and       
 redundant farmhouses converted into   
 elegant dwellings for city commuters. 
   Now only a few men work on the land,
 and their skills are required for a   
 knowledge of vehicles and machinery as
 much as husbandry. There appears to be
 a breakdown in village community life 
 as well. The school closed a decade   
 ago; the parish church is only        
 sparsely attended, and television     
 keeps families at home.               </content>
