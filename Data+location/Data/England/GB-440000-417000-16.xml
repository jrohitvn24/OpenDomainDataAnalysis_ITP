		<title>16TOP FARM MUSEUM</title>
		<content>{Top Farm agricultural museum}is       
 situated in 17 acres of land in West  
 Hardwick and was until recently part  
 of the{Nostell Priory Estate.}The     
 present owner, Mr Duckitt,gave up     
 farming 6 years ago to concentrate    
 full time on the museum. To help      
 support the enterprise he also holds  
 regular barn dances.                  
   There are many interesting items on 
 display at the museum, revealing Mr   
 Duckitts enthusiasm for our           
 agricultural past.The exhibits include
 old scythes, beet knives, pitch forks,
 ploughs, sickles and even an old      
 combine harvester which dates back to 
 about 1800. The harvester is operated 
 by a traction engine which is also on 
 display.
