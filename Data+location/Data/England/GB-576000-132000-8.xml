		<content>  I live in the country outside        
 Benenden                              
 village, so I have to go everywhere by
 car with Mummy or Daddy as there are  
 hardly any buses, but I use my bicycle
 or walk on the public foot paths. My  
 only real receation time is on Sundays
 and Saturdays. I play junior squash   
 and tennis at Hawkhurst. I like       
 swimming and the nearest pools are in 
 Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells. At     
 Christmas time I enjoy being in the   
 village pantomime which takes up every
 Sunday afternoon. When I am at home I 
 play games with my sister and also use
 our computer. I collect stickers and  
 coloured paper. In the summer I play  
 many garden games such as croquet and 
 badminton and I have a lot of fun with
 my three guinea pigs.
