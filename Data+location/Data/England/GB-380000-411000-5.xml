		<title>05 The Fire Station</title>
		<content>  Bury Fire Station was built in 1964  
 and it has two{fire tenders}and one   
 turntable ladder. There are 64 firemen
 at the station and they work 4 shifts 
 with 16 men on each shift.            
                                       
 You have to be 18 to train as a       
 fireman and you go to Manchester for 3
 months to train. Each fireman trains  
 to do everything, from going up the   
 turntable ladder to driving the       
 tender. They all wear special clothes 
 and a helmet so they do not get hurt. 
                                       
 When they are not at a fire the men   
 clean and check the tenders and train 
 to make sure they can cope with all   
 sorts of fires. They do not use the   
 fire pole any more but can be out to a
 fire within 45-60 seconds of a 999    
 call coming through the central       
 computer at Salford.  Mark Kay  age 8 </content>
