		<title>01The Grand Union Canal,Ashby</title>
		<content>  This canal passes close by Ashby on  
a transport route also followed by     
the A5,the M1,and the London-Birmingham
railway                                
 In 1929 the new Grand Union Company   
was formed by the merger of the        
Grand Junction Canal,Regents Canal,and 
three canals of Birmingham.The length  
of this new company line was 255 miles.
  The Grand Union Canal at Watford has 
seven locks,four of which are in a     
staircase.The Watford locks were       
widened for the larger steam barges    
or carriers,like Fellows, Morton and   
Clayton in 1901-1902 at a cost of      
100,000 pounds.                        
  The canal traffic used to consist of 
barges carrying coal and heavy         
agricultural produce,but now it is     
mainly holiday narrow-boats and cabin  
cruisers.                              
                                       </content>
