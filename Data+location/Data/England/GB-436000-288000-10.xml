		<title>10FARMING IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> Housing developments cause problems to
 farms in our area because town people 
 don't understand country life. The    
 farmers complain that the public use  
 their farmland to exercise their dogs.
  They also tip rubbish and vandalise  
 farm property. Holly Tree farm is     
 particularly affected as homes get    
 closer each year as the Council are   
 selling land for development. Nearly  
 all the land is used for arable       
 farming. Cereal crops are grown in    
 most fields with Brassica(Rape) in    
 others. Fertilizer is used instead of 
 the rotation of crops. A small amount 
 of land is cultivated grasssland and  
 pasture. As far as we can make out    
 there is only one small herd of dairy 
 cattle in our area.
