 Comprehensive system of education     
 consisting of First School(4-8) Middle
 Schools(8-12), High School(12-16) and 
 Sixth Form Colleges like Paston in    
 North Walsham for further education.

 The First School has 136 pupils. There
 are 5 teachers and 2 on supply. There 
 is no set time-table,just a start and

 lunch hour. During lesson time,
