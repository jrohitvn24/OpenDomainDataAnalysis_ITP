		<content> EXCAVATIONS OF ROMAN WRECK IN GUERNSEY
                                       
   Work is presently continuing on the 
 restoration of the hull of a Roman    
 ship found in St. Peter Port harbour  
 mouth.  The majority of the hull is   
 being preserved in large saline tanks 
 at  a warehouse in Victoria Road and  
 can be viewed by appointment.  There  
 is also a selection of artifacts that 
 were removed from the site.           
   The find is unique in that no other 
 vessel of this period as ever been    
 discovered in the area known as the   
 'Roman Empire'.  It indicates that    
 trading occurred between mainland     
 Europe and the Channel Islands.
