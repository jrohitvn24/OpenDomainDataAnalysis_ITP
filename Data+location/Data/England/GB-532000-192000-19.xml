		<content>         'THE POSTMAN'.                
        by Sarah Foreman  Age 11.      
                                       
 We post our letters in a letter-box.  
 When it comes to a certain time a     
 postman comes to collect them and     
 takes them to the Sorting Office in a 
 van.Our nearest Sorting Office is in  
 Church Street.At the Sorting Office,  
 they sort the letters and parcels out 
 into counties. Next they take that    
 county and sort it out into towns and 
 villages. Sometimes the letters are   
 sorted out by electronic machines with
 the help of the post-code.            
  That bag of letters and parcels go,  
 either in a van or on a train,to that 
 county's main Sorting Office where the
 letters are sorted out into           
 towns.They,in turn, are delivered door
 to door by the postman on his daily   
 rounds.                               </content>
