		<title>11BATTERY EGG FARM ON THE A53</title>
		<content>    The Egg-Packing Station is on the  
 A53 and is about four kilometres from 
 Shawbury.                             
{   One hundred and four thousand      
{chickens which are kept in}small      
 cages.  There are four rows of cages  
 and four chickens in each cage.       
   It is called a {battery farm;}some  
 people think it is cruel to the hens  
 but the eggs are cheap.               
  All the hens' energy goes into{laying
 instead of running about. To drink    
 they press their beaks against a lever
 and water drips out of a pipe.        
   They{employ six men and nineteen    
{women full-time and twelve more at    
{weekends.} 50% are part-time, the rest
 are full-time workers.  The women wear
 old clothes and blue checked overalls.
  The men wear jeans and T-shirts and  
 sometimes overalls.
