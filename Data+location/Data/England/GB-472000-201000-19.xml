		<content>   Car ownership is almost essential   
 for travel in this area.              
   Public transport consists only of   
 buses, for the railway track through  
 Chinnor now links only the Cement     
 Works with a main line at Princes     
 Risborough.                           
   There are bus services to Thame and 
 High Wycombe, and a coach travelling  
 to London passes through the village  
 twice daily. Although important, the  
 local services are too infrequent e.g 
 only two buses either way from High   
 Wycombe to Thame stop in Sydenham on  
 a weekday; there are none on Sundays. 
 Other buses do stop near Sydenham at  
 the crossroads on the Thame Road.     
   School buses take children daily to 
 Icknield School, Watlington, Lord     
 Williams School, Thame, and St Andrews
 Primary School in Chinnor. Another    
 coach takes students to Henley Tech.  </content>
