		<content>      There is a public park called    
 Mill Fold Playing Fields, which has   
 a children's playground and a bowling 
 green.                                
      At the side of the park there are
 two factories, one deals with concrete
 products the other is an iron works.  
      There are two pubs in the area.  
 One is in the bottom of the valley and
 is called The Old Bridge Inn, the     
 other is perched on the top of the    
 hillside and is called The Fleece Inn.
 From here there are beautiful views   
 across the fields into the valley     
 below.
