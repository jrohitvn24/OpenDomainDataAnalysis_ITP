		<title>06A nursery,Holbeach Hurn</title>
		<content> Mr.John Hardy owns a nursery in the   
 middle of Holbeach Hurn.We went to see
 it.We saw and tasted the strawberries 
 he was packing.7 people were working  
 on that,mostly his own family.We also 
 saw potatoes and courgettes.The other 
 crops were all                        
 flowers-lilies,iris,pinks and         
 liatris.Mr. Hardy has 7 glasshouses   
 and one polythene tunnel.He has an oil
 fired boiler for winter heating and a 
 mains water tank for irrigation.There 
 is a packing shed and cold            
 store.Mr.Hardy takes his produce into 
 Holbeach and from there it goes to    
 market in Manchester and London.      
    Mr.Hardy has 5 beehives.In July    
 there were about 300,000 bees.He sells
 his honey from the nursery and a local
 health food shop.He uses fungicide    
 spray but not insecticide as this     
 would kill his bees.                  </content>
