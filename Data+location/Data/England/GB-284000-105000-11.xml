 afternoon delivery, but the older     
 houses do! Before 1980 the resident   
 Postmaster and local people were      
 employed for deliveries.1n 1905 the   
 postman came in a pony &amp; trap from    
 Crediton and stayed until evening

 social centre. People meet there when 
 drawing state benefits, including     
 pensions, and to collect morning {

 a shop, including health foods, but,  
 on principle, no cigarettes &amp; husband 
 delivers newspapers and periodicals in
 the village )  Evening papers are     
 delivered, traditionally by one family</content>
