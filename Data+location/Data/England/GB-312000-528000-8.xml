		<title>08Landmark Church  Cockermouth</title>
		<content> All Saints' Church is the landmark of 
 Cockermouth. Its spire can be seen    
 miles away in all directions and the  
 clock chimes heard every hour.        
 I was allowed to look round everything
 I saw the vestry, and the priest's    
 vestry where the records show William 
 Wordsworth's baptism on 14th Jan.1772.
 There is a stained glass window to his
 memory also. It is the East window.The
 180 foot spire is supported by square 
 pillars and there is a long Chancel.  
 I went outside to the door into the   
 belfry. A spiral staircase led up. I  
 crossed the outer parapet into the    
 bell tower where eight bells peal for 
 services and weddings. I noticed the  
 bell ringers belong to the Ancient    
 Society of College Youths and have the
 distinction of ringing the peal of    
 Yorkshire Surprise Major, the first in
 Cumbria by a resident band of ringers.</content>
