		<content>     Askam not having any detailed land
 use plan or clear guide to areas      
 suitable for new development, the     
 problem for housing is aggrevated by  
 the demand for new residential land.  
 There has however been a steady amount
 of new building in recent years mainly
 because Askam is designated suitable  
 for substantial expansion in the      
 subsequent County Development Plan.   
     The problem is now more pressing  
 because of the influx of residents    
 working in the nearby industrial area 
 of Barrow. There are outstanding      
 planning permissions for some fifty or
 so dwellings,some of these will no    
 doubt improve some of the derelict    
 landscape. There is also scope for    
 residential development adjacent to   
 existing houses.Further development   
 may follow.                           
                                       </content>
