 the parish of St.Andrew's Ashburton.  
 There is no vicar at present,the last 
 one having retired to Bovey Tracey.   
 The new one comes from his post as    
 chaplain at Wakefield prison in       
 October. The church services are      
 conducted at present by the team      
 ministers from Ashburton.             
      Holy Communion and Evensong are  
 held on alternate weeks. Congregations
 of about eight to ten local people    
 attend, swelled by visitors in the    
 summer. Visitors are a major source of
 finance for the upkeep of the         
 church.Candidates for Confirmation go 
 to Ashburton.
