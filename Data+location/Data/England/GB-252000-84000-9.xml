		<content>   As with most of the mines the tin   
 ore dug from the hillside was         
 transported to the crusher by small   
 trucks. In the case of this mine along
 a granite tramway.                    
   Using water power the ore was       
 crushed, the waterwheel being in a    
 pit, and driven by water from a leat. 
   The tailrace of the wheel was used  
 to drive the {Buddles. }              
   This consisted of a pivot with two  
 arms projecting horizonally. Tied to  
 the arms were pieces a sacking or     
 heather. The water from the tailrace  
 turned the arms. Crushed rock from the
 main wheel was carried in water to the
 buddles. The gravel was washed out amd
 the heavier tin ore sunk to the bottem
 of the buddle pit, and was eventually 
 extracted.
