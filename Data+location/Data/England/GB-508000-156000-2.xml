		<content> There are two centres of population.  
                                       
{Downside:}most houses were originally 
 built for labourers who worked on the 
 local estates, which have now ceased  
 to exist. These houses have been      
 modernised and new houses built in    
 the same style.                       
                                       
{Effingham Junction:}most of the houses
 have been built within the last 40    
 years.                                
                                       
 Housing outside these two areas       
 consists mainly of large detached     
 farms.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
