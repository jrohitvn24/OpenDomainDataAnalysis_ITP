		<title>11TRANSPORT IN MID DEVON</title>
		<content> In part of the block public transport 
 is non-existent and each family has   
 its own transport. Another part of the
 block has a bus twice a week -        
 Wednesday and Saturday going in to    
 Okehampton at 9.30 am and returning at
 12.15 pm. There is also a bus to      
 Exeter once a month on a Friday       
 allowing a whole day in the city.     
 Once a month on a Wednesday &lt;market   
 day> there is a bus to Holsworthy,    
 leaving at 9.30 am and returning at   
 2.15 pm. These services are well      
 patronized - passengers being picked  
 up at cross roads. As there is no     
 school in the block primary school    
 children travel to Hatherleigh - about
 4 miles away - on a school bus and    
 secondary children go to Okehampton - 
 about 4 miles in the opposite         
 direction. From September 1985 the    
 public may travel on the school bus.  </content>
