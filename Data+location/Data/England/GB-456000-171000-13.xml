		<content> The{Kennet Morris Men}visited this    
 area in the summer. As a group they   
 have been formed for 28 years and     
 visit local hostelries in{Berkshire   
 and{south Oxfordshire.}By tradition   
 they perform dances from the{Cotswolds
 , the{City of Lichfield}and from the  
{Welsh Borders.}This form of amusement,
 whose origin or purpose is unclear,   
 have been a feature of Britain at     
 least since the{16th century.}Some    
 suggest that the dances bring good    
 crops and good weather, or that the   
 bells and the handkerchiefs ward off  
 bad spirits and bring fertility to the
 village. The tradition has been kept  
 alive due to the research of scholars 
 in the late{19th century}and more     
 recently by a{centrally organised     
{federation.}This arranges conventions 
 and asks groups to perform accurate   
 displays to maintain dancing standards</content>
