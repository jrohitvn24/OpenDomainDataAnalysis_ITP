		<title>14WRITTLE, HYLANDS PARK</title>
		<content> Hylands Park is not really in the grid
 that we have to study but it forms a  
 central part in the recreational and  
 social lif of the village so we have  
 decided to include it as one of our   
 pages of text.                        
        Hylands mansion and its 433    
 acres of parkland lie on the outskirts
 of Writtle, but the mansion itself is 
 now in a dreadful state of decay. The 
 house was built in 1728 for Sir John  
 Comyns who was member of parliament   
 for Maldon. The house has had a number
 of owners since it was first built.   
 The present owners are the Borough of 
 Chelmsford, and there are a number of 
 suggestions for its future use, one of
 which is to turn it into a municipal  
 golf course.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
