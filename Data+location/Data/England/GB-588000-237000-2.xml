   We have surveyed just a small area  
of this village. Within it are three   
schools-a first school, a middle       
school,and an upper school, all        
standing on the same campus. There is  
part of a private housing estate       
bordering the grounds of the first and 
upper schools and there is also a Rugby
Club.                                  
   The population of this village      
expanded greatly during the mid        
nineteen sixties as it was developed as
a London overspill area with the       
promise of employment at the nearby    
C.A.V. factory making diesel engines   
and fuel injection systems.There are   
eleven shops,four public houses,a      
church,a church hall, and a village    
hall.There is a youth unemployment     
scheme in the village and many clubs   
thrive.                                </content>
