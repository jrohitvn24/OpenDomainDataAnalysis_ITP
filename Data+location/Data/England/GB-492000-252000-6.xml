		<content> The village today owes much to the    
 Higgins family.Charles Higgins        
 purchased the estate at the end of the
 18th century and sold part to his     
 cousin John Higgins,who built Turvey  
 House in 1797.Turvey Abbey was Charles
 Higgins main residence  and his son   
 Charles Longuet Higgins set about     
 enlarging the parish church,rebuilding
 the insanitary estate cottages,       
 erecting new schools and providing a  
 reading room.The Lord Lieutenant of   
 the County is the husband of a        
 surviving member of the Higgins family
 and resides at Turvey House.He is Her 
 Majesty's representative in the County
 and is in attendance when any member  
 of the Royal family sets foot on      
 Bedfordshire soil,even though many of 
 these visits are private.
