		<title>10The Job Centre, Hemsworth</title>
		<content> In our interview with the Job Centre  
 staff we found out that there are two 
 hundred and sixty vacancies in the    
 Hemsworth area.                       
 Terry's factory is the largest        
 employer in Hemsworth. Ninety per cent
 of the jobs in Hemsworth are for women
 so most men have to commute to their  
 place of work. Young people at the    
 moment are unlucky when trying to find
 a position as most of the vacancies   
 are for older experienced people.     
 In some instances the rate of pay for 
 a man is less than the amount paid by 
 The Department of Social Security to  
 support a married couple.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
