		<title>13Schools in Irthlingborough</title>
		<content>    At the present time, schools in    
Irthlingborough consist of an infant   
school, a junior school and a          
comprehensive school. There have been  
schools of some sort in the town since 
the 14th century but schools as we know
them started in the 18th century. This 
was St. Peter's Church School and the  
instruction had to include reading,    
knitting and spinning. This was a      
charity school, which, in 1830 became  
Irthlingborough National School. In    
1877 Irthlingborough Board School was  
opened. In 1897, a separate infant     
school was opened on an adjoining site,
both schools still use the same        
buildings today. Both buildings have,  
of course, been modernised a little    
since then.
