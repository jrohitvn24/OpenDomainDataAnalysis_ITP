		<content> NORTH BRENT - GENERAL IMPRESSIONThis  
 area is a largely residential London  
 suburb.  It was developed between the 
 First World War 1914 - 1918 and the   
 Second World War 1939 - 1945, after   
 the Wembley Exhibition of 1926.  The  
 houses are mainly of mock Tudor design
 typical of the period, built mainly by
 developers Comben and Wakeling.  It is
 well served by public transport and   
 contains two major open spaces, parts 
 of which are threatened with          
 development which is vigorously       
 opposed by residents.  There are two  
 parks and very good sports            
 facilitie4s.  There is one small      
 industrial estate. The people are     
 mainly owner occupier middle class of 
 many nationalities, the largest group 
 being indigenous, followed by the     
 Asian group. Motor traffic            
 occasionally causes problems.         </content>
