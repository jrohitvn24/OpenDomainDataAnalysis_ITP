		<title>01THE AREA GWITHIAN-CAMBORNE</title>
		<content> The area surveyed is mainly rural and 
 lies between the largest population   
 centre in Cornwall(Camborne-Redruth)  
 and the cliffs of the North Coast. It 
 is a hilly area with slopes facing in 
 all directions and very largely       
 consists of medium size farms(200     
 acres approx). These farms are mainly 
 given over to the production of crops 
 or intensively managed grassland. The 
 climate,though mild,is very windy and 
 wet in winter.Most people in the area 
 live in isolated communities or farms 
 and so the area is lacking in         
 amenities.A visit to a population     
 centre like Camborne or Truro is      
 essential to shop or seek             
 entertainment or company. Not being on
 the coast,the area is less popular    
 with tourists and does not become so  
 congested as many parts of Cornwall.
