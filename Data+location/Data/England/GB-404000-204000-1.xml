		<title>01INTRODUCTION - BARNSLEY</title>
		<content>    The area we are concerned with is  
 mainly farmland owned by several large
 landowners. The main one is Lord      
 Faringdon, a stockbroker, whose       
 company, Barnsley Estates, owns a lot 
 of the village. One of the farms in   
 the village, Church Farm, is owned by 
 Mr Russell and is also very large. The
 village of Barnsley is the main centre
 of population - it has 121 people. It 
 lies on the A433, a busy main road    
 between Cirencester and Burford. The  
 road follows the course of the old    
 Roman road, Akeman Street. The road   
 which skirts the area, the A429, is   
 called the Fosse Way and is also a    
 Roman road. Between the two is an old 
 sheep road called Welsh Way used to   
 drive sheep from Wales to the markets.
    There are no shops in Barnsley at  
 all and no Post Office either. There  
 is one pub and a village hall.        </content>
