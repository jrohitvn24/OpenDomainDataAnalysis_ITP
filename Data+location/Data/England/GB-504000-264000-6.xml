		<title>06Swineshead 10 Mile Run</title>
		<content> As plans for the church restoration   
 got under way it became apparent that 
 large amounts of cash were required.  
 One of the ideas to come forth was to 
 hold a fun run starting at Swineshead,
 going through the nearby villages and 
 finishing at Swineshead.              
 This year will see the 4th run        
 underway. Each year it has got        
 steadily bigger and now has become a  
 recognised run in Bedfordshire. Due to
 its size it now comes under the       
 scrutiny of the Amateur Athletic      
 Associations and various rules have to
 be observed. After the excitement of  
 the first few runners coming accross  
 the finishing line the barbeque gets  
 underway also the draw for the raffle 
 takes place. The whole day is enjoyed 
 by one and all.                       
 The money goes to the church, cancer  
 research and St. Johns Ambulance.     </content>
