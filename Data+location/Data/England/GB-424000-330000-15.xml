		<content>{Rachael:}What takes up my spare time  
 is swimming.3 years ago I joined      
 Etwall Eagles Swimming Club.That was  
 where I started to swim in lots of    
 galas and open meets.Now I swim for   
 City of Derby Club.I have to go       
 training every day except Fridays.I   
 have won many medals and I save all   
 the newspaper cuttings in a large     
 scrap book.                           
{Lucy:}Most nights and weekends I spend
 my time practicing my music.I play the
 piano,flute and the guitar.I also play
 the recorder.I do at least half an    
 hour on all my musical instruments.My 
 piano teacher lives in Hilton but for 
 my flute I have to go to Rolleston,   
 which is four miles away.Sometimes    
 we have to cycle.I do my guitar and   
 recorder lessons at school.
