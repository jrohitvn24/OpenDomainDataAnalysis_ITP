		<content> AT HARVEST_TIME HIS MACHINERY COVERS  
 APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND ACRES OF   
 LAND.                                 
  IF HIS SERVICES ARE NOT REQUIRED     
 Mr. ASQUITH SERVICES AND REPAIRS HIS  
 MACHINERY READY FOR THE NEXT SEASON.  
 HE HAS TWO ASSISTANTS - ONE FULL TIME 
 AND ONE PART TIME. Mr. ASQUITH HIMSELF
 OWNS 40 ACRES OF LAND WHICH HE FARMS  
 IN HIS SPARE TIME. HIS FUEL BILLS,    
 EXCLUDING OIL, ARE Â£3000 TO Â£4000 A   
 YEAR.                                 
  WHEN HE FIRST STARTED WORK           
 Mr. ASQUITH USED THE OLD THRESHING    
 MACHINES, CUTTING WITH A BINDER AND HE
 WORKED ALL THROUGH WINTER AND SUMMER. 
 NOWADAYS THE MACHINES ARE BIGGER AND  
 THE WORK IS DONE MORE QUICKLY BUT     
 THERE ARE FEWER FARMS SO HE HAS LESS  
 WORK. IN THE FUTURE Mr. ASQUITH THINKS
 THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A NEED FOR       
 CONTRACT FARMERS.                     </content>
