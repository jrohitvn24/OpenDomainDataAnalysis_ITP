		<title>17Benfleet - The River Thames</title>
		<content>  As part of the new{River Thames}sea  
 defences to ensure that the 1953 flood
 disaster would never happen again; a  
 tidal flood barrier was built East of 
 the road bridge onto{Canvey Island}.  
 This is managed by the Anglian Water  
 Authority.The barrier has three gates.
  The barrier was operational by 1984  
 and was opened by HRH Princess        
 Margaret in that year.                
  West of the flood barrier,the creek  
 side environment has been improved by 
 landscaping and the planting of trees 
 and shrubs. When a road was built in  
 the 1960's,the creek was diverted from
 its old course past the Hoy and Helmet
 public house and the remains of the   
 old creek bed can be seen. Beyond this
 old channel to the West,are recreation
 grounds and a sewage works,all on     
 re-claimed land.The creek has saltings
 which takes the tidal overflow.       </content>
