		<title>20A child in Mentmore</title>
		<content> Russell is 11 and lives at Hilltop    
 House on the site of the old          
 allotments. The house is brand new, 6 
 bedroomed and his dad built it. He's a
 partner in a building firm. Russell   
 goes to school in Wing but in his free
 time he rides his bike around the     
 village and makes dens with his friend
 Jason in the grounds of Mentmore      
 Towers, where they can play freely. He
 likes living here because it's nice   
 and quiet - "It's louder in the house 
 than outside." Russell has lived in   
 Mentmore for 9 months. He says he'd   
 like to inherit the house eventually!
