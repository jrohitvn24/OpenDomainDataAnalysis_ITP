		<content>    Taunton Brook is a small valley    
 in between Waterloo County Primary    
 School and Canon Burrows Primary      
 School.Before we cleaned it up,it was 
 one of the areas worst eyesores.It was
 full of rubbish such as,oil drums,car 
 wheels, cars,wire and other debris.   
    It took a long time to clear up the
 brook.It took teachers hours to plan  
 and equally as long down the brook to 
 do the work.It took hundreds of       
 hours and hundreds of pounds to make  
 the Brook what it is today.The money  
 is usually collected by 'Coppers'     
 being given by parents,or by donations
 of money or bulbs and plants.We hope  
 it will stay that way for ever  so    
 other people can enjoy it.{
