		<content>  In{Mabe}we have a{Church}of{England} 
 which is called{St Laudus}after the   
  saint.                               
       The Church is a long way out of 
 the village because it was there to   
 serve the Parish of{Treverva}as well. 
 Opposite the church there is the old  
 vicarage which has been sold and is   
 now privately owned.                  
                     The vicar lives in
 a new vicarage which is a bungalow in 
 the village.There is also a{Methodist 
{Church}which is almost at the top of  
 Antron Hill. There is no{Manse}in the 
 village as there is no resident       
 Minister and the services are taken by
 a visiting{Minister.}
