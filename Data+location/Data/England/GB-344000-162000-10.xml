		<content> ALTHOUGH THE TRACK HAS BEEN REMOVED   
 THE REMAINS OF THE RAILWAY LINE WHICH 
 RAN FROM LOWER LANGFORD TO CONGRESBURY
 VIA WRINGTON ARE VERY OBVIOUS.        
 AT COX'S GREEN TO THE SOUTH OF        
 WRINGTON IS A SMALL INDUSTRIAL ESTATE 
 ON THE SITE OF THE RAILWAY. IN        
 WRINGTON ITSELF THE STREET NAME       
 "STATION ROAD", A SIGNAL AND A        
 BUILDING WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY ONCE PART
 OF THE STATION CAN BE SEEN.           
 FROM WRINGTON THE SMALL EMBANKMENT    
 NEEDED TO RAISE THE LINE ABOVE THE    
 FLOOD LEVEL OF THE RIVER YEO RUNS DUE 
 WEST OUT OF THE BLOCK.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
