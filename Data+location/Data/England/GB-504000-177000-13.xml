		<title>13A SCHOOLGIRL'S DAY</title>
		<content>                                       
 I get up at  seven a.m. on a Monday   
 morning. I go down to the bathroom and
 clean my teeth, go to the breakfast   
 table and eat cereal, boiled egg and  
 toast and then get dressed. I get my  
 dinner money and walk to school. I    
 sometimes go to the shop to get some  
 sweets. When school stops Mrs Burns,  
 our teacher, takes the register.      
 During school time we do games, art,  
 maths, English, religious education,  
 geography and history. When I come    
 back from school I have tea, then I   
 watch television especially the tennis
 at Wimbledon. Later on at 6 o'clock I 
 have dinner. At about 9-30 p.m. I go  
 to bed.
