		<content> Although we do not have any cinemas,  
 theatres or museums in our area, there
 are still quite a lot of things to do 
 in our spare time.                    
 There are quite a few children in the 
 Pony Club. This club meets during the 
 Summer. You can learn how to ride and 
 how to jump. Pony Club Camp usually   
 lasts about a week in the Summer      
 holidays.                             
                                       
 Quite a few children in our class     
 enjoy going to Choir Practice every   
 week on a Tuesday night. There are    
 nine children in the Choir. There are 
 also Lent Classes.                    
  If you want to go to Karate Classes  
 you have to go to Wooler or Alnwick.  
 One boy goes to Alnwick for Mini Rugby
 on a Sunday. Three children from our  
 class have piano lessons. The piano   
 teacher comes to each person's house. </content>
