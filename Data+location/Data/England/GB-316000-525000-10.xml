 is a yew-tree behind it where John    
 Wesley once preached.It is a slate

 long and quite tall,but inside most of
 it is taken up by one{large single-   
{storey room}with a slate floor.At one 
 end there is a tiny kitchen with a    
 small meeting room above it.          
   It was built as a{brewery}early in  
 the 19th century by the Jennings      
 family,but they moved to Cockermouth  
 where they still brew beer today.
