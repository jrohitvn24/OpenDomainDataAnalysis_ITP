		<title>18INTERVIEW WITH RECTOR</title>
		<content> Mr Bilney felt he was being called to 
 be a priest 16yrs ago after being an  
 engineer. Bishop Richard Rutt asked   
 him to take the United Benefice, once 
 approved by the Queen, Privy Council  
 and Church Wardens. Most services are 
 at Dunton Bassett being the largest of
 the three churches. Mr Bilney likes   
 each church in its own right. No other
 member of his family have been in the 
 Church, but in the 15th century a     
 Thomas Bilney was martyred and burnt  
 at the stake. There is little contact 
 with other religions; only Christians 
 go to the three churches. Mr Bilney   
 wears clothes dated from Roman times. 
 His favourite service is Holy         
 Communion because of the sharing of a 
 meal as one family. His favourite     
 Bible story is Matthew Ch.25v35-45 and
 favourite prayer that of St. Francis.
