		<title>08CONSERVATION AROUND MIDHURST</title>
		<content> There are many miles of footpaths and 
 bridleways.A group of people walk each
 footpath once a year to keep them     
 open.There is very little river or    
 stream pollution and little pollution 
 of the air as there is no heavy       
 industry.There is no conflict between 
 farmers and conservationists.Farmers  
 have not destroyed hedgerows which    
 shelter wildlife and they trim their  
 hedges in the late Summer to avoid    
 nesting and hatching periods.They are 
 careful when they spray crops not to  
 affect wildlife.Most farm buildings   
 are original ones used long ago.Local 
 animals include deer,badgers and      
 foxes.Everyone is keen to preserve    
 them.As there is a great deal of      
 woodland and common there is a wide   
 variety of flora and fauna.Local      
 groups work hard to ensure that the   
 habitat is not interfered with.       </content>
