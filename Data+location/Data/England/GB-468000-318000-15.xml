		<title>15A popular game by J.Taylor</title>
		<content> My favourite game is{ONE,TWO,THREE IN 
 This is a game where you need a lot of
 people to play, like 10 or 12, and you
 play it outside.You pick one person   
 who is going to be on.                
 Then you pick a place where you all   
 can stay but the person who is on     
 cannot stay in there.                 
 The person who is on counts to 100 and
 while he or she is counting  everyone 
 else gets out of the place and they   
 quickly hide. The person who is on has
 to find those people who are          
 hiding.The first person to be caught  
 is on the next time the game is       
 played.
