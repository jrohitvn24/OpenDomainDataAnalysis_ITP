There were plenty of hops along Slack  
Lane.We wondered if they had come      
originally from the nearby farm, the   
farmer using them to brew his own beer 
or perhaps they would have been seeded 
 rom Brewers Grains which is used as a 
cattle food.There was more vetch,rattle
and dead bluebells.We turned South East
into Hermitage Lane and soon found the 
new path.We walked along it back to    
school in a North Easterly direction.On
the walk we had seen a wide variety of 
trees:oak,ash,syucamore,holly and elder
but,sadly,many dead elms.One farmer,   
Mr.Gilbert Prince,told us he had lost  
over 100 elms on his land,every one he 
had.
