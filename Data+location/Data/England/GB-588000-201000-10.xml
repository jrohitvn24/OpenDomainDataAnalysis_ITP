		<title>10Attitudes re The Maylands</title>
		<content> Mayland is the old village with       
 Maylandsea as a riverside development.
 The newcomers in Maylandsea are       
 predominantly Londoners who have made 
 some money and want to live in the    
 country,but who want urban amenities  
 e.g. made up roads and street lights. 
 The established residentd who mainly  
 live in Mayland are slower to adopt   
 new standards.                        
 There is resentment of anything that  
 will take them away from family and   
 leisure at weekends. General apathy   
 towards church going but Church needed
 for ceremonial occasions.             
 Houses seen as a status symbol. No    
 room for children to play indoors,    
 they are encouraged to go outside. The
 housing is mostly well maintained     
 private housing.                      
 Preservation of salt marsh instigated 
 by residents.                         </content>
