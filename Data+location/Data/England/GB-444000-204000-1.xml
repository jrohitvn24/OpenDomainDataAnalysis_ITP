		<content> This is Matthew  Arnold  country.   It
 stretches from a loop of "the         
 stripling Thames" to "the warm,       
 green-muffled Cumner hillls".   The   
 area os within the Oxford Green Belt, 
 and though only 4 or 5  miles from    
 the centre of the  City, retains      
 much of  its rural character.         
 Development, or change of use, is     
 controlled by the planning            
 authority.The land-use of the block   
 includes 4 residential areas: parts   
 ofCumnor village and Farmoor, most    
 of Dean Court and Cumnor Hill.  The   
 remainder is mainly devoted to  mixed 
 farming, including a fruit farm which 
 offers pickk-your-own facilities in   
 summer.  The NW corner of the block is
 almost entirely  occupied by the two  
 adjoining Farmoor reservoirs.  The    
 area is bisected by part of Cumnor    
 Hill bypass.                          </content>
