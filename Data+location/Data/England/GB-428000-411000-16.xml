		<content> Woolley Feast is held evey year on the
 Saturday nearest to St.Peter's Day. On
 29th June,1985 celebrations began at  
 1.30 p.m. with a decorated bicycle    
 competition. Races began at 2 o'clock 
  for all children with a Donkey Derby 
 novelty race for families.I like the  
 obstacle race best.After the Donkey   
 Derby everyone could have free ice    
 cream.Cups were presented to the      
 winning boy and girl.Anna and I came  
 first,We share the cup for one year   
 each.Afterwards we all had tea.       
 The Disco started at 7.30p.m.I was    
 first there and I requested Frankie   
 goes to Hollywood,but it wasn't played
 till the end.The DJ put on the Conga. 
 I was leader and led them out of the  
 school and round it.
