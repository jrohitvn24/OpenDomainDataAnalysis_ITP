		<content> Many people in this rural area find   
 entertainment in their own homes by   
 watching{television,}especially in the
 winter. Nevertheless there is a real  
 community spirit in Rhydycroesau      
 which results in numerous activities  
 in the village hall throughout the    
 year.There are different organisations
 which hold regular meetings, such as  
 the Womens' Institute. The older      
 people in Rhydycroesau spoke of whist 
 drives, beetle drives and barbecues. A
 major annual event is the Christmas   
{pantomine}which takes place every     
 year. Local folk spend weeks          
 rehearsing for the event which is so  
 popular in the locality that it is    
 performed for several weekends. Not   
 only do local people run the show, but
 are also the target of many jokes!    
 Young folk fortunate enough to be     
 mobile go to the{cinema}in Oswestry.  </content>
