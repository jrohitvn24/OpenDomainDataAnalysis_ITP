		<title>16ATTITUDES IN WOLSTON</title>
		<content> Everybody in the survey{liked living  
{in Wolston}and were{satisfied with the
{amenities.}Some would be happy to see 
 part of Bluemels land sold for small  
 industrial units hoping for more      
 employment. People were satisfied with
 the shops but some would have liked a 
 chemist or a bank: children wanted a  
 sports shop. The older residents of   
 Bennett Court would like wardened     
 housing nearer to the centre of the   
 Village. It is a{long way to walk}to  
 the village hall and shops though some
 did have lunch at the nearby Wolston  
 High School and were very pleased to  
 be involved with the children. Some   
 people are against more housing being 
 built in case the village loses its   
{rural identity.}Traffic in the village
 is a problem as much of it exceeds the
 30 miles an hour speed limit and      
 parking is difficult in narrow roads. </content>
