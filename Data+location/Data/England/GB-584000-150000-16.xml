		<title>16MY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> My school is a very small one with    
 three classes and about eighty pupils.
 It is near the A20 main road and      
 although it is very dangerous we have 
 not had an accident since I started   
 school. When I started here there were
 five classes and over one hundred     
 pupils but the numbers have dropped a 
 lot since then.                       
 The hall, television room and spare   
 room are in the main building while   
 the office and toilets are in a       
 separate block that was once the      
 wartime Air Raid Shelters. The canteen
 and hutted classrooms are at the rear 
 of the school near the railway line.  
 We pay three pounds a week dinner     
 money and have different meals each   
 day.
