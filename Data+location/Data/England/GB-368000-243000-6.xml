 MR. HONE - BOSBURY HOUSE FARMS        
 Mr. Hone was interviewed on 3rd July. 
 The thing that he had noticed         
 changed in Bosbury was that everyone  
 had a motorcar.                       
 He would like to see the Youth Club   
 doing better. He joins in most of the 
 organisations.Six people live in the  
 house. The property is over 200 years 
 old. They own 800 acres of land. They 
 spend their freetime growing cherries,
 shooting                              </content>
