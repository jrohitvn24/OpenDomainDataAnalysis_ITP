		<content> The Club is financed by a '50 Club'   
 whereby people (approximately 60) pay 
 50 pence per week through the season. 
 A draw is made each week and Â£10 is   
 paid out in three prizes. In addition 
 two or three discoteques/buffets are  
 held to boost funds and the highlight 
 of the season is Presentation Night,  
 attended by over 80 people at a local 
 hotel. The night if offered as a full 
 dinner with the presentation and      
 followed by a disco. The night is     
 attended by many in the village who   
 are not directly involved in the Club.
