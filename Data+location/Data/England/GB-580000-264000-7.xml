		<content>  Residents were asked how the village 
had changed and most acknowledged that 
the expansion of the village had       
brought people of different            
backgrounds and outlook into the       
village, even to the extent that two   
populations now live side by side,     
those born in the village who still    
rely mainly on the land for their      
livelihood, and those who have moved   
in, in search of a rural lifestyle but 
who are still very much transplanted   
town dwellers. Some residents complain 
of loud mouthed youths, vandalism,     
litter and heavy lorries which are     
indications of some of the problems    
associated with urban living           
affecting this quiet country district. 
On the other hand villagers clearly    
rely heavily on the town for shopping  
etc. as transport was a concern which  
was often voiced.                      </content>
