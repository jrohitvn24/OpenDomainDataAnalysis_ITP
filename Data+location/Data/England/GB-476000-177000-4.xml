 The bells of St. Mary's Church are    
 rung by ringers of all ages. The choir
 welcomes young people as well as      
 adults. There are four house groups   
 which meet twice a month to share a   
 meal and fellowship, an active Sunday 
 School and a youth group. I arrived   
 from the USA eight months ago and I   
 already feel I completely belong.
