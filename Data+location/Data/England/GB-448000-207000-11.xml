		<title>11 Medley Boatstation   Oxford</title>
		<content>  Medley boatstation has been on Port  
Meadow for sometime.Because of its     
situation cars have to drive across the
Meadow to get there.The problem is cars
are not supposed to cross the Meadow as
it disturbs the peace and frightens the
horses.                                
 The owner of the boatyard             
wants to build on the Meadow.He wants  
to make Port Meadow into a leisure     
centre for holiday makers.As it is     
public land people have made an outcry.
   At the moment he has a small stretch
of water for mooring boats.A petition  
went around to the local people and    
most of them were opposed to the       
expanding of the boat station.The owner
has decided not to build on            
the meadow for a few years.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
