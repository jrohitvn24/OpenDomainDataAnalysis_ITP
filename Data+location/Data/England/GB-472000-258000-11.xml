		<title>11THE CARLSBERG BREWERY</title>
		<content>We visited the Brewery in July 1985.We 
entered by the main entrance in Bridge 
Street.We learnt that the project began
in 1969 and went through four stages of
development ending in 1979.Lager brew- 
ing began in 1973.It is interesting to 
note that this Danish firm chose a site
overlooked by the site of a 9th.Century
Danish settlement.The total cost so far
of this Brewery is about L100M, capable
of producing 2M. barrels.Its ambitious 
architecture was designed by Knud Munk 
and was awarded the Financial Times    
Award for Industrial Architecture.This 
year marks the 35th.anniversary of one 
of its popular brews-Carlsberg Special 
Brew-inspired by a visit to Copenhagen 
by Sir Winston Churchill.The drink is  
brewed and stored for a long time and  
sold in bottles and cans but not on    
draught.The Company was one of the     
first to aid art,science,and medicine. </content>
