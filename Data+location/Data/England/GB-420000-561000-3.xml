		<content> Our school building is {seventy five }
 years old and it was built in 1910.   
 Until about five years ago ew had     
 separate infant and junior schools.   
 These were then put together to make  
 one primary school.Children come to   
 our school after their fourth         
 birthday.They spend up to seven years 
 in the {primary school} before going  
 on to one of the comprehensive schools
 at the age of eleven.We have ten      
{classes} in the school and about 250  
 children.Our day begins at 9 o'clock  
 and ends at 3.20. We have an hour and 
 ten minutes for lunch as well as a    
 morning and afternoon playtime.We     
 study maths,English,science and art as
 well as learning about our area.We go 
 to the swimming baths every week and  
 also to the games field.The boys play 
 football while the girls play         
 rounders.                             </content>
