		<content>   On the highland (>250m), beef cattle
 and hill sheep are kept.  On the quite
 gently sloping land around 100m,      
 grassland is intensively managed for  
 silage or used for potato, barley or  
 oil seed rape production.  Dairy      
 cattle and certain lowland sheep, e.g.
 Suffolks are kept on the steeper      
 valley sides and floor.  In places,   
 pigs are reared.  Some grains and     
 silage are grown on the valley floor. 
   With a medium sized population, most
 of the food produced is exported for  
 procesing and marketing.  Milk is     
 generally bought by the Co-op Dairy   
 in Whitby, which also makes butter and
 cream.  Animals are sold at Ruswarp   
 Mart.  Lambs and beef cattle are      
 mostly bought by local butchers.  Wool
 is usually bought by Northern Wool    
 Growers (Malton).  There are market   
 gardens sending produce to Whitby.    </content>
