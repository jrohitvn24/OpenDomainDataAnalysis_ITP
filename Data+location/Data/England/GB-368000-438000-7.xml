		<content>   My day starts unpleasantly - a bell 
 wakes us up at 7.10.When we have      
 washed all together downstairs we say 
 our morning prayers and have          
 breakfast.After a short Assembly we   
 have 5 classes,broken by a morning    
 break when we have a drink,receive our
 letters or see our Playroom Master on 
 discipline matters! Several days a    
 week we have games in the afternoon   
 when we can make use of our lovely new
 Sports Hall but on non-games days we  
 go back to class for 3 more lessons   
 after lunch.During the lunchbreak we  
 have been able to follow our hobbies  
 like Shooting, Archery ,Computers,Art,
 Chess,Carpentry and many others.We    
 don't have an afternoon tea so our    
 next food is at 6.00 when we have a   
 cooked meal.Most evenings we have     
 Studies (homework!) but we still have 
 time to play outside.                 </content>
