		<title>19THE BAPTIST CHAPEL</title>
		<content> We visited the Baptist Chapel at{     
{Sutton-in-the-Elms}.It was built in   
 1650.The hexagonal part has been added
 to the original room.The Baptists used
 to meet secretly under the elm trees. 
 The first pastor was Thomas Townsend  
 from 1650-1699.There have been        
 seventeen pastors to the present day. 
 The Chapel was the first in           
 Leicestershire and had stables to     
 enable people to travel to the        
 services.Before the Chapel had a      
 baptistry people were baptised in the 
 brook,the last person being Thomas    
 Rainer in 1851.The Chapel has a       
 pulpit,a manse and a graveyard.The    
 oldest stone remaining is dated 1725. 
 There is an organ and choir stalls.The
 Chapel has a valuable and rare clock. 
 There is one like it in Windsor       
 castle.                               
                                       </content>
