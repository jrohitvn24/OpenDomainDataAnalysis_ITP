		<content> Population increase throughout the    
 Colne Valley dates back to the 18th   
 and early 19th century with the advent
 of the textile industry and improved  
 road, rail and canal transport.In 1860
 the population of Scammonden was three
 times what it is today.               
 The recent decline in textiles has    
 contributed to demographic stagnation.
 Population trends have fluctuated in  
 recent years.Between 1971 and 1981 the
 population in the block rose slightly 
 but this increase has tapered off.The 
 percentage of pensioners has risen    
 from 20% to 25% during this period.   
      In 1971,unemployment in the Colne
 Valley was 2.25%.Now this has risen to
 13.7% and the area is considered to be
 'Yorkshire's unemployment blackspot'. 
 This factor plus the increasing cost  
 of rural housing has led to population
 stabilisation in this block.          </content>
