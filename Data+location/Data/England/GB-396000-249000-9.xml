		<content>   The farmers are becoming, with the  
 help of government incentives, much   
 more aware of conservation. At the end
 of Gunnings Lane, on land belonging to
 Manor Farm, a reservoir has been dug  
 to attract wild-life, a heron as well 
 as  mallards have been seen on it.    
   Similarly the newly erected Grove   
 Farm at the end of Broad Lane have dug
 a new pond, cleared an existing one,  
 thinned out and re-planted the copse  
 and put nesting boxes on the farm.    
   Bishampton was selected as a major  
 project area in the county for a "tree
 planting scheme" which helped to      
 replace many dead elms.Jubilee Walk so
 named to commemorate the 25th         
 anniversary of the Accession of H.M.  
 Queen Elizabeth II in 1977, to the    
 east of the village has numerous trees
 including mountain ash, oak, birch and
 hazel, planted in the bridalpath area.</content>
