		<content>The most common local concern recorded 
was vandalism. Litter and graffiti are 
common, particularly in the local      
shopping precinct.  Some people made a 
link between the above and insufficient
leisure activities for young people in 
the neighbourhood. Although there is an
excellent sports centre there is only  
one small youth club, which is on the  
fringe of the area.                    
Another common concern was the proxim- 
ity of the area to the Sizewell Nuclear
Power Station, together with the       
transport of its waste for reprocessing
which passes by rail through the area. 
Comments also showed concern about:    
the local rating system; volume of     
through traffic in residential areas;  
urban planning which leads to office   
blocks and depopulation of town centre;
dogs fouling the pavements.
