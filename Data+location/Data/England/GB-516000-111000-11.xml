		<title>11Steyning Court</title>
		<content> The building where the courts stand   
 was built in 1883, but was converted  
 into a court in 1960.It was going to  
 be in Shoreham but there was a fault  
 at the site and the building at       
 Steyning was for sale. On average the 
 court gets{Â£3/4 millon pounds}a year  
 in fines. The court is down Bank      
 Passage in the High Street, it is open
{Mon -Thur.}The court handles{15,000   
 cases a year.There are three different
 courts in the building. The smallest  
 is called the cupboard. The area the  
 court covers is; Steyning, Horsham,   
 Fishers Gate, Henfield, Lancing,      
 Sompting, Southwick and               
 Storrington.The population of this    
 area is{93,480}people.The worst case  
 they've had was 3 murders. The        
 difference between a Crown Court and a
 Magistrate's is a Crown Court has a   
 Judge and Jury.                       </content>
