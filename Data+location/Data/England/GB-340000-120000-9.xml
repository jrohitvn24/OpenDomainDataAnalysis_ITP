 First we saw the cider apple orchards.
 Around October the apples are picked, 
 washed and put into a wooden pit.Then 
 they are carried on steps up a narrow 
 moving belt to a crusher which pulps  
 them.The pulp comes down a tube onto a
 cloth on a trolley.When the pulp is   
 about 15 cm deep it is wrapped in the 
 cloth and a square board is placed    
 over it.This procedure is repeated    
 until there are 20 boards with 15 cm  
 depth of pulp in cloth between each   
 pair.The trolly is then pushed under a
 press.The apples are pressed till all 
 the apple juice has been pumped       
 through a pipe to a vat.Sugar and     
 yeast are added.The yeast turns the   
 sugar into alcohol. Cider is left in a
 vat for about 6 months and then it is 
 pumped into barrels to be sold.
