 This area,situated in West Yorkshire  
 is a good example of British moorland 
 and its surroundings.The main land    
 cover is the moor which is rich in    
 plants and wildlife.The major plant   
 that covers most of the moor is the   
 heather.                              
   The three major towns in this area  
 are Micklethwaite,Riddlesden and      
 Morton.Out of these three,the biggest 
 is Riddlesden,followed by Morton,then 
 Micklethwaite.There are no major      
 factories or industrial works         
 around,but this area used to have some
 from the industrial revolution,but    
 they are unused nowadays.             
   In the three villages there are     
 mainly houses,although there are a few
 shops.The main features are the moor, 
 the towns,the canals,the roads and the
 school.                               </content>
