 it was handed down to the third       
{Chetham}brother.This happened once    
 more but this time the brother had    
 children.                             
 The dining room,during the 19 century 
 was used as servants' quarters.The    
 windows were very high up the walls.  
 This was to stop the servants looking 
 out when they should be working.      
 There is a beautiful staircase, it is 
 made from 3 different woods:{Mahogony,
{Elm}and{Oak.}Out in the hay loft some 
 of the beams are over 500 years old.It
 is written that the{Duke of Monmouth  
 stayed at Southill House overnight as 
 a guest of Edward Strode when he was  
 fleeing from the{Battle of Sedgemoor.
