 Most housing in the village is pre    
 first world war.Most are small        
 cottages.Some have been extended. The 
 main materials used are brick and     
 tiles. Some extensions have been built
 with hand-made bricks so as to fit in 
 with the character of the village.    
 MODERN DEVELOPMENTS                   
 These have taken place on Main Street,
 Elmfield Drive and St.Quintins Park.  
 Elmfield Drive is a mixture of        
 privately owned semi-detatched and    
 detatched houses and borders the golf 
 course. St.Quintins Park contains     
 bungalows and houses owned by the     
 Local Authority and some privately    
 owned.
