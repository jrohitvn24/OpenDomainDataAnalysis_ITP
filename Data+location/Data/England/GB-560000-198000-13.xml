		<title>13The Shaftesbury Society</title>
		<content>    Trueloves, the residential home for
 slightly mentally handicapped adults, 
 is a branch of the Shaftesbury        
 Society. 1985 is a special year for   
 the Society, for it is 100 years since
 the death of the first President, Lord
 Shaftesbury, Anthony Ashley Cooper.   
    The Society was started in 1844 as 
 the Ragged School Union to care for   
 needy, young people. Lord Shaftesbury 
 was a great social reformer in Queen  
 Victoria's reign and was known as the 
 'Children's Earl'. Many thousands of  
 children were saved from long and     
 painful hours in factories, coal mines
 and chimneys.                         
    Trueloves is only one of the many  
 places the Society runs. There are    
 Mission Centres, Further Education    
 Centres for the disabled, Residential 
 Schools for physically handicapped    
 children and a Housing Association.   </content>
