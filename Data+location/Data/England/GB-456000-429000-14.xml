 Peter Stell became the vicar of the   
{"SHARED CHURCH" of St.Francis}in      
 Thorpe Willoughby.(See p.6)           
 "I see Thorpe Willoughby as an        
 extremely exciting challenge. I find  
 that the team ministry of which I am  
 part,works well and is based on mutual
 trust and understanding."             
 Peter Stell worked in retailing and   
 market research in the Leeds area     
 before training for the ministry at   
 Salisbury and Wells Theological

 in radio and television techniques and

 for the last four years.

 clerk in Salisbury whilst he was at   
 college. They have a two year old son,
 Mark.
