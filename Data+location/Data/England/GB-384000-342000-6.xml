		<title>06Factories in Stoke</title>
		<content>There are lots of factories in this    
area.They are mostly potbanks.One of   
the biggest factories is the Michelin. 
The factories are important to us      
because without them people would have 
no jobs.                               
  But having factories means that there
is pollution.Sometimes we can smell the
fumes from the Michelin factory when we
are in the school playground.The       
factories also take up a lot of space. 
  In our school about a quarter of the 
children have relatives who work in a  
potbank.My mum works for the Royal     
Doulton potbank.She does not make the  
ware but she serves tea to the         
directors and staff.                   
  If someone wanted to build a new     
factory I think they should put it in  
Stoke because Stoke has lots of main   
roads,a railway,a river and a canal.   
There are lots of people to do the work</content>
