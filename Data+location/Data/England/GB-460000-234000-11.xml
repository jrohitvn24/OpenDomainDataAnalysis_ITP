		<title>11THE DAILY LIFE OF A ADULT</title>
		<content> My name is Peter Tiley. I am handyman 
 to Beachborough School, a preparatory 
 school for boys and girls aged 4 to 13
 The school occupies the old Manor     
 House and although new classrooms have
 been added and a gymn, the old rooms  
 are still used for dormitories, dining
 rooms offices etc. so there is a lot  
 of repair and restoration to be done. 
 At the moment I am finishing some work
 on old lead on the dormer windows.    
 Then there is a bathroom conversion to
 do.I have just found a piece of       
 newspaper wrapped round the old bath  
 waste.It is dated September 1903 and  
 comes from Barnstaple.Sir Samuel Scott
 bought the house in 1901 and he had a 
 lot of alterations made after that.On 
 Fridays I take the children for       
 woodwork and in the Spring term there 
 is the scenery for the school musical 
 to make and paint.                    </content>
