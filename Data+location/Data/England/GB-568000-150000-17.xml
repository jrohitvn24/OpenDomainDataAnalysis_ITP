		<title>17A YALDING POET: HEALTH</title>
		<content>                                       
 The late Edmund Blunden, celebrated   
 poet and author, lived in Yalding when
 young and makes reference to the      
 village in his writings. Members of   
 his family still live in the village  
 and Blunden Lane is named after them. 
 A window in the church engraved by    
 Lawrence Whistler is to his memory. In
 Yalding there is a family doctor      
 practice with its own pharmacy. There 
 are ante-natal and mother and baby    
 clinics in the village. The nearest   
 hospitals are at Linton and Barming,  
 with an eye hospital at Maidstone. On 
 the outskirts of Yalding, Kenward     
 House is a rehabilitation centre for  
 homeless men, run by the Kenward      
 Trust, a charity. There seems in      
 Yalding to be a higher number than    
 usual of two child families comprising
 a boy and a girl.                     </content>
