		<content> As almost everyone has a garden,      
 gardening is by far the most popular  
 hobby. Although some people grow      
 vegetables it is the flowers and      
 shrubs which abound, and the whole    
 village is a blaze of colour during   
 the summer months, even to small      
 patches on the side of fields. All the
 homecraft subjects such as knitting,  
 embroidery, dressmaking and cookery   
 are well practiced followed by        
 reading, writing, music, painting,    
 bridge &amp; whist. Others make a hobby of
 renovating their homes or doing       
 woodwork, and making models. Outside  
 the home, people of varying ages enjoy
 sports such as swimming, badminton,   
 golf, dancing, snooker, shooting,     
 fishing, pigeon racing, motorcycle    
 scrambling, roller skating and showing
 horses. Some of the ladies make the   
 Womens' Institute their hobby.        </content>
