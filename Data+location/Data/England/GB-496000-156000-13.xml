		<title>13OLD PEOPLE, MY GRANNY</title>
		<content> My granny lives on her own as she can 
 go up and down stairs easily. She is  
 very fit and able, but my dad comes up
 sometimes. She does not drink much tea
 or coffee. My granny likes travelling 
 and prefers to arrive at her          
 destination! She has been to Colorado 
 and Vancouver. She loves to see her   
 grandchildren and quite enjoys having 
 them to stay. She enjoys gardening but
 it exhausts her. She loves growing    
 plants and flowers. She is very good  
 at arranging them. Cindy, a Cairn dog,
 needs a walk every day. She loves     
 seeing the children at school.        
 My granny was born in 1910 and will be
 75 next birthday.
