		<title>09MR. NELSON - A FARM WORKER.</title>
		<content>    We had a talk from Mr. Nelson an   
 old farm worker . He told us that in  
 the olden days farm workers were hired
 the hirings and they had to live and  
 work on the farm for a year. The      
 farmers argreed on a price for the    
 man's labour and then they worked.    
 If they did not like  it they wouldn't
 work for them again.Helperby feast    
 they did all sorts of things games,   
 eating, running sports, and hiring.   
 The farmers went to the  feast  for   
 labourers and agreed a price with the 
 workers but the labourers stayed at   
 home.There were three horses  used for
 ploughing potoes and only two for corn
 and one for turnning over. They used  
 three for potatoes because they needed
 to plough deeper.                     
 Mr.Nelson had a farm accident when he 
 chopped his foot off  in a rotavator.
