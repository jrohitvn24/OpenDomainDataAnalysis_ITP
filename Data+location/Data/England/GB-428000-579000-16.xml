   Broadway, Plessey Road, Rotary Way  
 and South Beach are in the area we    
 have looked at. On Broadway the houses
 are 45 to 50 years old. There is a lot
 of stained glass used in the windows. 
 Originally Blyth was going to be a {  
{GARDEN TOWN}and we can see this in the
 many grassy areas and trees to be     
 seen. The main trees are{SYCAMORE}and{
{LABURNAM.                             
{ }Croft Park Stadium is a{Football    
{Stadium.}Blyth Spartons play in the   
 Amateur League.                       
   Ar Croft Park the schools are       
 Victorian in style. This you can see  
 by the windows in the schools.        
   Rotary Way was built a few years    
 ago. On that site there were fields   
 and a bridge across the railway line.
