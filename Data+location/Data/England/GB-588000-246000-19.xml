		<title>19POLICING : LAVENHAM</title>
		<content>                                       
There is no Police Station in Lavenham 
but law and order is maintained by a   
village policeman living in a police   
house. He patrols on foot or by        
bicycle. His first priority is protec- 
tion of life followed by security of   
property.                              
If an arrest is made the suspect is    
detained in the Police House until his 
transfer to the Police Station in Sud- 
bury, where there is also a Magis-     
trate's Court.                         
An important factor is the help given  
by the policeman's wife, acting as     
receptionist to complainants and dis-  
tressed people.                        
The duties of the community policeman  
include attending Parish Council       
Meetings. He also assists with the     
local Youth Club.
