		<title>02BARNARD CASTLE-HISTORIC TOWN</title>
		<content> In 1964 Barnard Castle was among 51   
 towns listed as being of outstanding  
 quality,worthy of preservation as part
 of the national heritage.Many         
 buildings are of yellow sandstone with
 Teesdale slate roofs.Grants help with 
 the high cost of repairing such       
 roofs.The Civic Society has renovated 
 and resold some old buildings.Barnard 
 Castle has many old lanes and yards,  
 some in need of repair. Too much heavy
 traffic on the  A67 goes through the  
 town. At times the main street is     
 overloaded with cars. The traffic     
 causes noise,fumes,parking problems   
 and building damage.Heavy traffic has 
 been diverted from the mediaeval      
 bridge to another  historic bridge.   
 This now has to be closed for         
 3months.Is a new bridge or a bypass   
 the answer?Is there a suitable site   
 for a new bridge?                     </content>
