 MRS.NEWELL TOLD US OF THE VILLAGE 45  
 YEARS AGO. TRNASPORT WAS MAINLY BY BUS
 OR TRAIN. MANY ROADS WERE UNMADE BUT  
 SOME HAD HARD SURFACES. THERE WERE    
 MANY HIGH HEDGES. BRYANT AND MAY      
 PLANTED A LARGE FOREST OF POPLARS,    
 WHICH WERE TO BE USED FOR MAKING      
 MATCHES.                              
 MOST VILLAGERS WERE EMPLOYED IN       
 NURSERIES WHERE BULBS AND             
 FLOWERS,ASPARAGUS AND SALAD CROPS WERE
 GROWN.THE FLOWERS WERE DESPATCHED     
 DAILY BY TRAIN FAR AND WIDE -EVEN TO  
 SCOTLAND.                             
 HOMES WERE HEATED BY OPEN FIRE        
 RANGES-AN OVEN ON ONE SIDE AND A WATER
 BOILER ON THE OTHER.FLAT IRONS WERE   
 HEATED IN FRONT OF THE FIRE SO YOU    
 COULD IRON THE CLOTHES.               
                                       
                                       </content>
