		<title>11 AYNHO - ROADS</title>
		<content>   There are 5 roads leading to other  
places. The {MAIN ROAD} is the A.41    
trunk road. It starts in London and    
comes to Aynho via Watford, Aylesbury  
and Bicester. Then it carries on       
northward to Banbury, Birmingham and   
the north-west. It is a very busy road 
used by lots of lorries.               
   The {B.4031} comes to Aynho from    
Buckingham via Croughton. It carries on
westward to Clifton, Deddington and    
joins the Banbury-Chipping Norton road.
It used to be a turnpike road, and     
there was a toll cottage at the        
junction of Portway and A.41.          
   There is a {COUNTRY ROAD} which     
leads to Charlton and Farthinghoe.     
   There are plans to build the M.40   
{MOTORWAY} in a few years time. It     
will follow the Cherwell Valley from   
London to Birmingham.                  
   Portway is an old road now a track. </content>
