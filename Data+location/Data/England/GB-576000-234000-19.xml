		<content>   Shops in the area are mainly small  
 family-run concerns, although there is
 a large supermarket in Sible          
 Hedingham. These include grocers,     
 greengrocers, newsagents, butchers,   
 bakers, a chemist, antique dealers and
 electrical dealers. There are three   
 small-holdings which sell plants and  
 vegetables. A coalyard on the         
 outskirts of the village deals with   
 164,000 tons of coal a year and       
 supplies fuel to a large area. Daily  
 milk deliveries are made to households
 by a number of roundsmen. A mobile    
 wet-fish van visits the village each  
 Wednesday and fish and chip vans also 
 call regularly. There is a small      
 hairdressing saloon in the centre of  
 the village. Three garages in the area
 sell petrol and a variety of products 
 for cars and motorbikes, as well as   
 sevicing vehicles.                    </content>
