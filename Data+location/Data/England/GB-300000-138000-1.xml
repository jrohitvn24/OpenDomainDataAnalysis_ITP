		<title>01THE BRENDON COUNTRYSIDE</title>
		<content> In the north part of the Brendon Hills
 all the roads are very narrow and     
 some places can only be reached by    
 walking along ancient tracks with     
 high hedges on each side.  Close to   
 Felons Oak 3 tracks cross and by      
 climbing over any of the gates you can
 look over the fields and even see     
 across the Bristol Channel to Wales.  
 Most of the fields are cultivated and 
 the red earth shows up in all the     
 green. There are clumps of deciduous  
 trees scattered along the edges of the
 lanes. Sheep can be seen in the odd   
 patches of rough pasture, and the farm
 buildings look small from so high.    
 The hedges are overgrown and are full 
 of wildlife. In June there are many   
 wild flowers, birds, stag beetles,    
 butterflies and other insects.        
 Few people live here so the wildlife  
 seems very abundant.                  </content>
