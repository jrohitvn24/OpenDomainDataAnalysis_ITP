		<content> The village has grown in size greatly 
 in the last 25 years due mainly to the
 2 large housing estates built for     
 people working in Swindon.{The Beeches
 built between 1959-61 to the west of  
 the village consists of 30 houses and 
 bungalows but{Chestnut Springs}to the 
 east, some 120 houses, is still       
 expanding at the present time so that 
 it has become far too large for the   
 village.                              
 There is a{village hall}where Cubs,   
 Brownies, Guides and the Red Cross    
 meet and the school hold assemblies   
 and plays. Next to the{Sun Inn}is a   
{garage}and a village{shop and post    
{office.}There is a{sports field}behind
 Chestnut Springs but as yet no village
 football team to use it. A recent     
 addition to{The Street}is an{antiques 
{shop}in the former village bakery.
