		<content>   I like living in Aspley Guise       
 because it's a nice peaceful area and 
 there's lots of places to go to also  
 there's lots of entertainment like    
 cubs, concerts and parties in the     
 Parish Hall and there's lots of       
 pubs.Also there's the common where    
 there's swings, football, cricket,    
 bowling and a big castle that children
 can play on.My mum and dad like living
 in Aspley Guise because it's peaceful 
 and so that David and I can play with 
 our friends, also mum and dad like it 
 because my dad can get to work quicker
 on the motorway also the railway is   
 nearby. {(Gregory)}   It is quiet and 
 sunny, the people are friendly, it    
 has nice walks. We have chickens, a   
 cat and dog and we grow vegetables.   
 We couldn't have all these in a flat  
 in a big city.  {(Emily)
