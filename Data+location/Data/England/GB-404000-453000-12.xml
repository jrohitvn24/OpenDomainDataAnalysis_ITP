		<content> The only{shop}in{Bolton Abbey}is the  
{Post Office,}where you can buy stamps,
 sweets, and tourist things.           
 People go to the{supermarkets}in      
{Skipton, Ilkley, Keighley, Leeds, and 
{Bradford}once a week for{groceries.   
 For other things such as{clothes}they 
 go to the shops in those places.      
 Many people choose things from        
{catalogues}which  are delivered by    
 post, and pay for them in instalments.
 Very few goods are delivered by       
 shopkeepers now. The only regular     
{delivery van}is for bread and         
 cakes, which comes from{Harrogate.
