		<content> The first people who lived in Bilsdale
 were thought to have crossed from     
 France during the Ice Age when the    
 English Channel was frozen over.As    
 there  are no Roman remains it is     
 difficult to tell whether they ever   
 came to Bilsdale .We have a good many 
 remains to tell us that the           
 Normans came here such as field       
 names,peoples names and Helmsley      
 Castle.Iron,glass,pottery have been   
 made here and there have been         
 remains of furnaces etc found. These  
 activities are not carried out now    
 neither is coppice, wodding, jet      
 mining, blacksmithing which were done 
 before.There are less people live here
 because farming has become more       
 mechanical and therefore less people  
 are required to carry out the         
 work.After the Ice Age the first trees
 were pines.                           </content>
