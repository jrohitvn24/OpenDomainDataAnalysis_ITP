		<title>07OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school was designed in 1849       
 because an epedemic in the area did   
 not come to Wingfield. It opened 3    
 years later and cost Â£216 . Most of   
 this was raised locally. More was     
 added to it in 1953 to give it 2      
 classes, cloakroom, indoor lavatories,
 scullery and small library. Recently  
 the County tried to close it but the  
 parents made them change their mind.  
 There are 54 children aged 5 to 11.   
 Half live in the village. We have a   
 secretary working 6 hours, a dinner   
 lady 5hrs., a caretaker who also      
 serves our dinners. Hot dinners are   
 brought from another school.40 of us  
 have sandwiches and we picnic under   
 the apple trees in Summer.We have 2   
 fulltime teachers and one who comes in
 one day a week.I like games we pay to 
 swim in Bradford. Lots of mums come to
 help with reading,cooking and sewing. </content>
