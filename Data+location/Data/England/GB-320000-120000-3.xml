 fourth group  of people include       
 pensioners and{retired}people who have
 also moved into the area from         
 other parts of the South West.The lack
 of stress involved in urban life which
 may be enjoyed by rural dwellers in   
 Somerset is surely a major attraction!
  Alltogether although one will often  
 therefore hear a rounded Somerset     
 accent it is not at all unusual to    
 hear a great many other accents as    
 well.                                 
 One is left with an impression of a   
 healthy{balanced local community} in  
 the Trull and Staplehay area,content  
 with the life-style and not anxious to
 change much less the quality of life  
 enjoyed at present is threatened.
