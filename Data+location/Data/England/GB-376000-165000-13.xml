		<content>{THE CEREMONY OF CUTTING THE TURF      
 We all set off that morning when the  
 birds began to sing,                  
 To see the new foundations the        
 builders were to bring.               
 We got there at last,hip-hip-hooray,  
 The grass rippling as a patch of sea, 
 Around there was a boundary line to   
 mark off where the school was to be.  
 Suddenly, ouch! ouch! ouch!           
 The place was full of nettles,        
 Luckily there were dock leaves to help
 us get more settled.                  
 Because the Mayor is here at last we  
 all shout out for joy,                
 He walks up very stately except for   
 stumbling over a boy.                 
 Father Goodman, our Rector then made  
 a quiet little speech,                
 The Mayor dug the turf and said"Built 
 for people to teach."{-by LOUISA PEAD
