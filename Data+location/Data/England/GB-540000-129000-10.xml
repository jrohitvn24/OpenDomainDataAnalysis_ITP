		<title>10HOUSING, CHELWOOD GATE</title>
		<content> Dwellings have been and are continuing
 to be built as ribbon development and 
 infilling following roads and tracks, 
 with a few isolated ones in Ashdown   
 Forest. Houses are mainly two storeys 
 high and there is a significant pro-  
 portion of bungalows. Most dwellings  
 are constructed of brick though a few 
 are built of Sussex Ironstone or      
 timber. Nearly all property is owner  
 occupied with very few rented.
