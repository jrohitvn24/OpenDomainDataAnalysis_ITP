		<title>09THE ALMSHOUSE, SHERBORNE.</title>
		<content> The Almshouse stands on the South _   
 Western corner of the Abbey Close. It 
 is open from 10:30 a.m to 12:30 p.m.  
  Residents have to pay Â£32 but in     
 August this is going up to Â£45 but    
 this includes food.                   
  They have to make their own entertain
 _ment around the place but sometimes  
 they go on trips and mystery tours,   
 for e.g.they have just gone on a      
 mystery tour to the New Forest. They  
 have to be in by 10.00 at night but if
 they are going to stay out later they 
 are given a key.                      
  Most people go there because they    
 have no relatives. The place is only  
 used as an old peoples home not a     
 hospital but there is a Matron who    
 looks after them and gives medical    
 attention if they need it.
