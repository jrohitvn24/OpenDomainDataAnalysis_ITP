		<title>07MACDONALDS COMES TO CLACTON</title>
		<content> Grimwade and Clark was one of         
 Clacton's oldest shops. It has been   
 pulled down to be replaced by         
 MacDonalds.MacDonalds have won their  
 year long fight to put their restraunt
 by the sea.MacDonalds will create a   
 lot of new jobs but some people think 
 there are already too many food places
 in Clacton.MacDonalds hope to have the
 restaurant built by the summer of     
 1986. When MacDonalds is built, other 
 places like the Wimpy Bar are going to
 find they have less customers than    
 they used to. MacDonalds wanted their 
 restaurant up by the sea because they 
 felt they would get more customers. I 
 think when Macdonalds opens small     
 stands by the beach won't sell so many
 packets of chips and burgers as they  
 used to.I think MacDonalds will be    
 kept busy at first but then it won't  
 be quite so busy.                     </content>
