 I didn't get up very early on Saturday
 as there was no school.My brother and 
 sister were up before me,and my mum   
 had a 'lie in' as well.When I got     
 downstairs my Dad had made a cup of   
 tea and was reading 'The Sun'.        
   The hairdresser came to do my mum's 
 hair in streaks and to cut my fringe. 
 I went and did some shopping with my  
 mum and sister then we had dinner.    
   After dinner my dad went to the pub 
 and I helped my mum make a surprise   
 tea for him. We made a trifle,        
 sandwiches and sausage rolls. Me and  
 my sister made some cakes and I iced a
 birthday cake. My mum and stepbrother 
 went to the pub to fetch him. When he 
 found out he was very happy. After the
 party we watched television then at   
 10.00 p.m. I went to bed.
