		<title>02Kettlesing - A Dales Village</title>
		<content>   Kettlesing is a scattered village   
 in the civil parish of Felliscliffe,  
 covering 2 sq.km. to the SE of the    
 block. It is a fine example of a      
 Yorkshire Dales village, with scatter-
 ed hamlets such as Kettlesing Bottom, 
 Kettlesing Head, Tang and Longscales, 
 stretching along the sides of the Tang
 Beck and in the sheltered valley      
 bottom.                               
   The majority of the houses are      
 modernised farmhouses or agricultural 
 buildings, many over a century old,   
 though there are scattered recently-  
 built bungalows.                      
   The village has two inns, a licens- 
 ed restaurant, a primary school, an   
 Anglican Church and Methodist Church, 
 and a village hall. The local shop/   
 Post Office closed in early 1985.
