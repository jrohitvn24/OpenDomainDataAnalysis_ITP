		<title>03Farming on Lansallos coast</title>
		<content>      The farming is carried out mostly
 by tenants of the National Trust. It  
 is mainly sheep and cattle rearing,   
 with some greens and cauliflowers and 
 cereal crops.Potatoes are also grown  
 and are of good quality and early     
 season and thus very profitable.      
 Potatoes are also grown in allottments
 on the cliffs-usually sold in local   
 shops.The fishing is mostly 'inshore' 
 by handline for special fish like     
 turbot and other expensive varieties. 
 Crab and lobster are also caught      
 mainly for domestic consumption or use
 by restaraunts in nearby Polperro.
