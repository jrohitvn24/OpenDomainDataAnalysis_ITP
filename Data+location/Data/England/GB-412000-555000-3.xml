		<title>03FARMING - DERWENT VALLEY</title>
		<content> Hay is also fed to lambs, calves and  
 hens. The surplus is sold as animal   
 food. The land is divided into parts; 
 one third arable, one third for       
 cultivation and one third for grazing.
    Various types of machinery are used
 a tractor,plough, discs, harrows,drill
 and corndrill to plant corn. For hay, 
 chain harrows, roller, reaper or      
 mower, hayturner, bale sledge, bale   
 transporter and a trailer with sides  
 are used. The farm does not possess a 
 combine harvester so they hire one. A 
 combine costs between Â£20000 to Â£40000
    The farmer rises at 6-6:15am and   
 goes to bed around 11:00pm. In summer 
 he finishes around 9:00pm but in      
 winter, around 5 - 6:00pm. There are  
 many jobs to do on the farm; hoeing   
 turnips, field work, hedging,         
 ditching, fencing, cutting weeds,     
 milking goats and feeding animals.    </content>
