		<title>12THE PRINCE REGENT</title>
		<content> Brighton's existence as a tourist     
 resort owes much to the Prince Regent.
 In the summer of 1783 he first visited
 the town.He was a tall, elegant and   
 courteous twenty-one year old, who was
 later to become King George IV. He    
 enjoyed the theatre, horse-racing and 
 attending dinner-parties in the town, 
 where he met a local aristocrat by the
 name of Lady Maria Fitzherbert.       
  In 1785 the prince secretly married  
 this virtuous Catholic girl, six years
 older than himself and already twice  
 previously married.Earlier laws       
 prevented mixed religous marriages for
 royalty and under the Royal Marriage  
 Act he was not allowed to marry       
 without his father's consent before he
 was 25 years of age.
