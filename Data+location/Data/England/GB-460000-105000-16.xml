		<title>16PORTCHESTER PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> Ball games are popular all the year   
 round.  Games vary in seasons like    
 conkers in the autumn and marbles in  
 the summer.  Some girls play marbles  
 but other girls play skipping games.  
 The most popular game at the moment is
 marbles, but some people prefer other 
 games such as hom pom and five lives. 
 Five lives is a game where you have a 
 tennis ball, you let it bounce three  
 times then you catch the ball and aim 
 it at the person.  If the ball hits   
 the person he or she loses a life.    
 Hom pom is a game where one person    
 counts to a hundred and the others go 
 and hide.  If he sees them or finds   
 them he runs back to his post and says
 "hom pom (name) one two three".  If   
 the person gets to the post before the
 person who's 'up' the person who's not
 'up' says "hom pom me one two three".
