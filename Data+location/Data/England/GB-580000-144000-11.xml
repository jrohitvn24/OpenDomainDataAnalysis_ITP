		<content> In the{reception class}children are   
 helped to settle into school by being 
 allowed to play with toys,building    
 bricks and sand,as well as being      
 taught gradually to read and write.   
 The next 2{Infant classes}gradually   
 become more and more like a working   
 classroom with mathematics reading    
 writing,science,art and craft and T.V.
 programmes. The{Juniors}do not play   
 with the Infants and their work is    
 harder too. They begin to work with   
 the Kent Mathematics Project. They    
 also have harder text books and can   
 play games like football and netball. 
 Juniors and Infants make use of the   
 school's 2{micro-computers.}There is a
 swimming pool and after-school clubs  
 like badminton,choir,table-tennis and 
 gymnastics. About twice a year the    
 Juniors and the Infants produce a play
 or a show.{It is a very happy school. </content>
