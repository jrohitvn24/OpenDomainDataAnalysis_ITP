		<title>10ASHURST BRIDGE SEWAGE WORKS</title>
		<content> Ashurst Bridge sewage treatment works 
 was opened in 1936. It is an automatic
 plant and no men work there but it is 
 checked daily for approximately four  
 hours. Its purpose is to treat        
 domestic and industrial waste. Eleven 
 hundred cubic metres of waste goes    
 through the works every day. The waste
 is pumped into the reception chamber  
 where the heavy grit and silts are    
 separated. These go into a detritor   
 chamber, then to the primary          
 settlement tanks. The solids are then 
 separated from the sewage and sludge  
 which is pumped into the sludge       
 storage tanks and disposed of to land 
 or sea. Then the solids pass through  
 filter beds and are pumped to the     
 final settling tanks. From there it is
 pumped into some kind of waterway, in 
 this case the Bartley Water.
