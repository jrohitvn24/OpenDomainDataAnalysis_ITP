		<title>13HOME LIFE OF HELEN</title>
		<content> My day as a 13 year old child starts  
at 6.30am, when I go to feed my pony. I
get back at 7.30am, get changed and    
have my breakfast. At 8.30am I go to   
school, till 3.45pm. I go home and     
change into my riding clothes, then go 
riding at 4.10pm till 7.30pm. After    
riding I do my homework, and have tea. 
At 10.30pm I go to bed.                
 A day in the life of a working mother 
starts at 6.30am to take me to my pony.
Then she gets the breakfast on, and    
then dresses my brother David. She     
takes him to school, and goes into work
at 9.00am till 8.00pm. She has an hour 
for lunch time. When she gets in she   
gets tea on, and then she washes up,   
and irons. She goes to bed at 12.00am. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
