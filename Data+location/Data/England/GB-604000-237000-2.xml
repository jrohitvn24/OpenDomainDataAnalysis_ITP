		<content>IN Great Wenham the Post office which  
had been run for 20 years by Mrs.Madder
closed on her retirement in January    
1984.There are two letter boxes, one in
the wall of the old rectory opposite   
the church and one near the council    
houses, which are collected twice a day
at 9.15a.m. and 4p.m. except Sundays.  
The postal deliveries are via Stratford
St. Mary which gets the post from      
Colchester in Essex and therefore      
usually results in a delay of one day. 
In Raydon the only shop in the village 
serves primarily as a Post office and  
has a telephone call box and a letter  
box adjacent to the building.The postal
delivery is via Hadleigh.
