		<title>20THE OLD BAPTIST CHURCH</title>
		<content> A little baptist chappel was built on 
 Reddy lane over 200 years             
 ago.Worshippers came from as far away 
 as Stockport,and services were held in
 secret.The chappelis derelict now,but 
 it was a plain building,simply        
 furnished with oak pews, a pulpit and 
 oil lamps.a caretaker's house was     
 built on to the chappel,later a whole 
 row of cottages was added.The         
 decendents of the caretaker occupied  
 the house for over a century.Large    
 gravestones and tombs are crowded     
 together, filling the small front     
 garden. The building was sold in 1985 
 to a private buyer.
