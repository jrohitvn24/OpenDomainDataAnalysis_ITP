		<title>05The Bishop's Palace</title>
		<content>   In the Churchyard the remains of an 
 old wall can be seen .It is all that  
 is left of the Bishop's Palace built  
 by Gundulph Bishop of Rochester in    
 the eleventh century.This was a good  
 site for his palace because the       
 Cathedral at Rochester could be easily
 reached by river from here.           
   Bishops used the palace until the   
 sixteenth century.Then it became a    
 private residence until 1749 when     
 it was turned into a workhouse.       
   Gradually the building fell into    
 disrepair and its stone was used for  
 other buildings such as Starkey Castle
 at Wouldham on the other side of the  
 River Medway.                         
   Behind the Palace Wall the remains  
 of the old Halling to Wouldham ferry  
 crossing points can be seen.The ferry 
 closed in 1964 after 600 years.
