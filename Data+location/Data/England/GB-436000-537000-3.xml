		<title>03Wingate - By Pass</title>
		<content>    One of the{main routes}from the{A19
 to{Durham,}the{A181,}passes through   
 part of Wingate. The{B1280}forms the  
{main street}of the village. These two 
{roads cross}on the northern side of   
 the village. This caused{considerable 
{congestion}at{peak traffic times.     
    Through traffic was held up and    
 local traffic sometimes brought to a  
 standstill. Because of this it was    
 decided to{build a bypass}to the      
 north.                                
    The villagers had wanted this for a
 number of years but money had never   
 been available to begin the project.  
 The{EEC,}however, was able to{provide 
 the{finance}for the work to be carried
 out.                                  
    The road was{completed}in just over
{eighteen months.}The through traffic  
 now passes unhindered and local       
 driving is much more relaxed.         </content>
