		<title>02The Village Hall,Horningsham</title>
		<content> The{Village Hall}which is situated    
 on the main road was built in 1930 at 
 a cost of #8000 by the then{Lord Bath}
 in memory of his mother, is used by   
 different clubs and organisations.    
 Among them are the Womens Institute, a
 Youth Club and a very successful      
 Luncheon Club. The hall can hold 160  
 people though in former times the     
 limit was 200; the reduction coming as
 a result of new fire regulations.     
 There is a well equipped stage which  
 is used from time to time by local    
 amature groups for plays and          
 pantomimes. The{Parish Council}hold   
 their meetings in a small room above  
 the main hall. The hall is            
 administered by a special committee.
