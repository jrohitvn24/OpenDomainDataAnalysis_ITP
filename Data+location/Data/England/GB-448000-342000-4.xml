 about some of the homes:-             
   My house is{detached.}It has three  
 windows at the front. They are case-  
 ment windows and are double glazed.   
 The bricks are joined with quetta     
 bonding. The door is arched and       
 mostly made of glass. The wood part is
 painted white. There are also pipes   
 and guttering on the front of the     
 house.
