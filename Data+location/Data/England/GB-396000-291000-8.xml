		<title>08Shops of the 80s</title>
		<content> Shops in 1985 are very different from 
 those of years ago.Instead of going   
 into the shop and asking for what you 
 want all you need to do is go to the  
 local supermarket where,under one roof
 you can buy all the things you need.It
 doesn't matter what the weather is    
 like because if it is hot or cold the 
 air conditioning will keep you cool or
 warm.Locally there at least 5         
 supermarkets and a very big           
 hypermarket,Sava-Centre,in            
 Oldbury.There, you can find everything
 from clothes and shoes to fresh foods 
 or electrical goods.The shop is said  
 to be larger than West Bromwich       
 football ground.There is room for 5000
 cars on the car park and there is even
 a petrol station if you run out of    
 petrol.
