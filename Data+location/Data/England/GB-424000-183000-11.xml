		<title>11A survey of pets.</title>
		<content>  In my survey of pets I discovered    
that there were 104 birds in Ashbury   
and Idstone.There were 30 fish,27 dogs,
15 cats,14 rabbits,7 horses,2 guinea   
pigs and 1 tortoise.                   
  A lot of people who had birds said   
that birds do not run away.            
  I found that the rabbits were kept   
mostly in the middle of the village and
dogs and cats, I found, to be nearer   
the edge of the village.               
  Most of the houses by the busiest    
roads did not have any dogs,cats or    
rabbits.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
