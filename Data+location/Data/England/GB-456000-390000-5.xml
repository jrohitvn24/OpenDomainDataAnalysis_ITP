		<content> Our school caretaker goes angling at{ 
{Sandbeck Lower Lake.}He is part of{   
{Maltby Colliery Angling Club}which has
 a 7year lease. An electronic count two
 years ago showed 2,800 roach 2,400    
 perch 150/200 tench 17pike. Others are
 rudd and carp.A{permit}is Â£10 annually
 plus Â£3.75 Trent River Licence.The    
 season is 16th June to 16th March.The 
 lake has 49 fishing places.Monthly{   
{matches}are held on a Sunday.At 6.30am
 a whistle goes to start the           
 competition by 11.30am another whistle
 goes for stopping.If there is a fish  
 on your rod you are allowed 15minutes 
 to try and get the fish.On the first  
 day of the season people arrive early 
 3.00am can find you being one of      
 thirty.Even so a dawn curfew is       
 enforced.There are many rules for     
 members but to follow the{country     
{code}is more than adequate.           </content>
