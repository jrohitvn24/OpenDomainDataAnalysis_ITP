		<title>15SOCIAL CONCERNS IN BRAMSHAW</title>
		<content>{  TRAFFIC.}Speeding along narrow roads
 results in deaths of animals but we   
 feel road widening is not the answer,&amp;
 fencing would spoil the unique        
 character of the Forest. A speed limit
 would help.A restriction on large     
 lorries is pressed for.               
{LIVESTOCK.}Should the numbers left on 
 the Forest be restricted?             
{OIL EXPLORATION.}If this is allowed   
 there is fear the ecological balance  
 &amp; landscape may be affected.          
{TOURISM. }The numbers of walkers,     
 campers &amp; horseriders should be       
 carefully controlled.                 
{AMENITIES.}Lack of leisure amenities  
 for the young &amp; lack of transport     
 affecting old &amp; young. Threat to shop 
 &amp; PO. Financial problem if maintaining
 the fabric of village hall &amp; church.  
 Loss of small cottages due to         
 enlargement by middle class newcomers.</content>
