		<title>03Stansted Airport</title>
		<content> After twenty years of arguing,it has  
 been decided to develop Stansted      
 Airport as London's third airport.The 
 reason that it is to be developed is  
 that it is near London and has a big  
 enough runway to take Concorde and    
 Jumbo Jets.At the moment they only    
 take half a million people a year.Soon
 it will take seven or eight million   
 people a year.The runway is so long   
 because it was built during the war by
 the Americans to take large troop     
 transport planes.                     
 By the year 2000 Stansted could be    
 handling 15 million passengers a year.
 There have been four public inquiries 
 but on 5th June 1985 it was announced 
 that Stansted was to be developed.The 
 people in the area are deeply         
 concerned,as their way of life will be
 changed,but it will also bring many   
 jobs to the area.                     </content>
