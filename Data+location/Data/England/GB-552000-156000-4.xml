		<title>04Kemsing School Centenary</title>
		<content>Kemsing School is situated in the      
centre of the village.  In 1985 it has 
celebrated its centenary.              
It opened in 1885 with a roll of 75.   
Attendance in those early days         
fluctuated greatly with the harvesting 
and hopping season.  Fenella, a pupil  
at the school now, tells us about a    
typical day in 1985.  School begins    
with registration and assembly at 9am. 
Until playtime at 10.30 they work at   
mathematics. After a short break is    
English, a story to write, poetry,     
grammar work or reading.  Dinner is at 
12 until 1.10pm.  The afternoon work is
art/craft, projects and sport. School  
finishes at 3.15pm. School clubs       
include Netball, Football, Swingball,  
Tennis, Cricket, Rounders and Swimming.
Today there is a falling roll of 237.  
Many families have moved away from     
Kemsing to find jobs and cheaper homes.</content>
