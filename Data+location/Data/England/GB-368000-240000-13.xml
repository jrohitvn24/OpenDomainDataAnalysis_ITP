		<title>13WELLINGTON HEATH TODAY</title>
		<content> The village of Wellington Heath is    
{situated}2 miles north of Ledbury and 
 its railway station, and only 4 miles 
 away from the M 50. It has grown as a 
{sector of Ledbury,}where most of it's 
 inhabitants work, but it is also good 
{commuter country.                     
 This{residential area,}which has more 
 than{doubled} since 1954 when mains   
 water was laid on, followed in 1974 by
 mains sewerage, is mostly clustered   
 round the Common and a B Rd to Ledbury
 The {population} of 500 live in 200   
 houses - a 5-fold increase in the last
 20 yrs.{Further building is unlikely, 
 as residents stress at every Parish   
 Council AGM that more houses should be
 banned and that they wish to remain a 
{rural community,}with no lighting or  
 gas and few other amenities.          
 The residents are either elderly or   
 young families, with few teenagers.   </content>
