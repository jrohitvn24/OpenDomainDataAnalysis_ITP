		<content>{Housing in Rotherham.}                
 Rotherham houses date back to the turn
 of the century.  Many older terraced  
 houses have been demolished, those    
 remaining being modernised with the   
 aid of council grants. Broom is an    
 area of mainly semi-detached houses   
 built in the 1930's whereas Brinsworth
 rapidly expanded in the 1950's.  The  
 newest area is Moorgate consisting    
 mainly of larger, detached dwellings. 
 The rate of growth of population in   
 the borough is one of the fastest in  
 the country. This may well be         
 attributed to its having one of the   
 youngest populations. Consequently    
 land is being made available for      
 future housing developments to meet   
 the new demand.  The planning         
 department is currently redrawing the 
 Green Belt boundary to safeguard the  
 many areas of natural beauty.         </content>
