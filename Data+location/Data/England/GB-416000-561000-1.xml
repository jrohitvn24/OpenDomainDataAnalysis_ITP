		<title>01BLAYDON AND WINLATON</title>
		<content> Blaydon and Winlaton lie on the south 
 bank of the River Tyne 7km west of the
 centre of Newcastle upon Tyne. Blaydon
 is situated on the floodplain of the  
 river, while Winlaton is sited at a   
 height of 133m above the valley floor.
 Blaydon has a population of 9,942 and 
 Winlaton 8,683.                       
 The history of the area is bound up   
 with that of coal mining and iron     
 industries. This industrial base has  
 completely disappeared , and          
 consequently unemployment is over 15%,
 and over 20% for 16_19 year olds.     
 Blaydon still has light industrial    
 plants, but Winlaton is a commuter    
 village serving Tyne &amp; wear.          
 Both places have modern traffic free  
 shopping precincts, and are well      
 served by road and rail links to      
 Newcastle and Hexham.
