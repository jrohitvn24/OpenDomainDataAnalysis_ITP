     This text was written and designed
 by children from{Andrews' Endowed     
{Primary School, Holybourne.} It was   
 mostly done by the upper junior class,
 but the lower juniors helped as well. 
                                       
     We worked in groups of five or    
 six, and went around finding out      
 information.                          
                                       
     We kept a notebook for bits of    
 information and did lots of work in   
  it.  It was very enjoyable doing the 
{Domesday survey,}and we hope our      
 information will be used a lot in the 
 future.
