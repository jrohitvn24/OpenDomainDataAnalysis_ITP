		<content> Beacon Lodge, which is to be found on 
 Alderley Edge is a sandstone building 
 Above the door it has the letters     
 :I.T.S, M.J.S, 1837. These are the    
 initials of Sir John Thomas Stanley   
 who became the first Lord Stanley of  
 Alderley in 1837 and his wife Marie   
 Josepha.When we moved in to the Lodge 
 it was horrible, dust everywhere.     
 Because the lodge was quite small we  
 had to have an extension attached to  
 it. We had several goats so we had to 
 make a goat house and a run for them. 
 We had one acre of land at the back   
 of our garden, it was very weedy.     
 Because the Lodge was right on the    
 Edge we had plenty of opportunity to  
 walk the dogs and goats and to enjoy  
 the countryside.
