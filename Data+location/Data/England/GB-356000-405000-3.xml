		<title>03THE WIGAN PIER COMPLEX #2</title>
		<content>  The{Heritage Centre}at Wigan Pier is 
 a kind of museum, but it is also much 
 more because it has live exhibits. It 
 is intended to show what everyday life
 was like in Wigan around 1900. Human  
 exhibits show what a Pit Brow Lass or 
 a Mill Hand did for a living. Other   
 people featured include a collier's   
 wife, school teacher, music hall      
 comedian, clogger and a basket weaver.
  Some shops and streets are recreated 
 and the sweet firm of William Santus, 
 famous for{Uncle Joe's Mint Balls,}is 
 also shown. There is a souvenier shop,
 a tourist information centre and some 
 private offices all within the nicely 
 restored warehouses the oldest of     
 which dates back to 1777.             
  The final touches to the renovation  
 are found on{The Orwell,}a pub named  
 after the author of{The Road to Wigan 
{Pier.                                 </content>
