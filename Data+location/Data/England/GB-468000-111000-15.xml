		<title>15THE A3(M) MOTORWAY</title>
		<content> The motorway takes up about 14% of    
 each grid square it passes through. It
 is part of a vital link between       
 Portsmouth and London speeding up     
 journeys for business transport       
 especially. At 10.00a.m. on 22nd May  
 1985, I counted 107 cars, 17 lorries, 
 2 coaches and a minibus going         
 southwards, during a 15 minute survey.
 Travelling north were 67 cars, 17     
 lorries, 1 community bus and a motor  
 bike. The lorries carried timber,     
 sand, metal containers, scrap metal,  
 fruit and vegetables, sports equipment
 and double glazing. There were three  
 unmarked lorries and a removal van.   
 Building materials made up the highest
 proportion of goods carried, about    
 36%. 62% of the traffic was southbound
 and 38% northbound. The survey was    
 conducted from Horndean Hill bridge.
