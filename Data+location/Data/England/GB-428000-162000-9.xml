		<title>09HOUSING IN SHALBOURNE AREA</title>
		<content> The earliest houses were built round  
{cruck beams,}curved timbers joined at 
 one end, the other forming a triangle 
 with the ground as a base. Even when  
 these cottages have been encapsulated 
 by brickwork and extended, the cruck  
 beams can still be seen inside, and   
 blackened, showing that when they were
 built they had a hole in the roof     
 instead of chimneys. Many of the now  
 single houses were once two or three  
 cottages. There are{7 council bunga-  
{lows for the elderly}as well as about 
{20 council houses,}some of which have 
 been purchased. There has been little 
 or no new building in the village in  
 the last fourteen years, but before   
 that about twelve bungalows and four  
 private houses were built on what was 
 farm land. Several recent applications
 for infilling have been refused but in
 the last 6 months one has been allowed</content>
