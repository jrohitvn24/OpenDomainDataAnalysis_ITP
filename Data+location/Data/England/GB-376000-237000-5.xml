		<title>05Castlemorton - Village</title>
		<content> The village of{Castlemorton}lies      
 surrounded by common land to the South
 East of the Malvern Hills.  The       
 housing within varies from 17c half   
 timbered cottages through to modern   
 red brick houses, mainly spread along 
 the main road of the village. It      
 contains a church, post office and    
 general store, and a primary school   
 with 4O pupils.  The community hall   
 lies outside the main boundaries of   
 the village and is also used by the   
 neighbouring parish.  The main        
 occupation of the villagers is mixed  
 agriculture but many commute to       
 business in the towns around.  A      
 number of householders offer bed and  
 breakfast and three caravan club      
 listed sites are available for        
 visitors.  Strict building regulations
 mean that the village is not expected 
 to grow in the forseeable future.     </content>
