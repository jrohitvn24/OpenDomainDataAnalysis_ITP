		<title>04WHY I LIVE IN BAD'HAM/DENNTN</title>
		<content> Work was the main reason for living in
 Badingham &amp; Dennington.               
 Next came housing - the availability  
 of a suitable house or land, the      
 reasonable cost or a liking for a     
 particular house. For many the        
 village was their birthplace or they  
 were country born. Others came to be  
 near family or friends. Some chose the
 villages because of the rural aspect &amp;
 environment, the quiet, their         
 preference for village life or to be  
 in the catchment area of a particular 
 school. A few came to escape from     
 London; because they liked East       
 Anglia; were relatively near to       
 Ipswich or were close to their leisure
 pursuits. For one Dennington resident 
 the proximity of shops &amp; a bus        
 service was the deciding factor.
