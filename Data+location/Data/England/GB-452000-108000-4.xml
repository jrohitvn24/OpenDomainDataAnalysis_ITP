		<content>    There are approximately 150-200    
 clubs although most clubs are outside 
 our grid reference.  Many residents   
 belong to them.                       
    Examples of these are Ladybirds    
 Social Club for young mothers with    
 small children, Sarisbury Green's     
 Green Theatre and business clubs, such
 as the Round Table. In our area, there
 are the first Burridge Girl Guides and
 the                                   
 Burridge Women's Institute.  Ladybirds
 arrange weekly meetings and some      
 outings.  Green Theatre, although     
 amateur, is very professional, founded
 by Greg Lawson twenty years ago.      
 Although men recently dominated the   
 business scene, women have come into  
 the picture.

   There are six postboxes and one     
 telephone box:most people have phones.</content>
