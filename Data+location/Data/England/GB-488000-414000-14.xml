		<title>14Trials Riding by Kevin</title>
		<content> I go Motorbike riding because I enjoy 
 it.It takes skill and stamina to ride 
 a trials motorbike.I go to Bagmoor    
 quarry but there are lots of other    
 places  where you can scramble.My     
 bike is a Yamaha TY80.Lots of boys    
 have bikes like me.Usually these bikes
 have an engine size between 80cc and  
 125cc.The clothing that people wear is
 leather suits with padding on the     
 knees,elbows and a crash helmet.This  
 special clothing is necessary because 
 accidents do happen and if you are    
 involved your normal clothing would be
 damaged and you yourself might be cut 
 or grazed.Competition and events are  
 arranged to see who can go round a    
 particular course in the shortest time
 .If you miss an obstacle or put your  
 feet down you get time faults.
