		<title>03Lound Village,Notts.</title>
		<content> Lound is a village with a road right  
 through it and houses on each side.   
 It has a pub called the Blue Bell and 
 a village hall that was made from a   
 chapel.  It has a playing field and   
 going down the road there are old     
 people's flats where they can ring a  
 bell if they need help and a warden   
 will come.  There is a Sub-Post       
 Office and it is open every day       
 except Sunday.  They sell food and    
 sweets.  In the joiner's shop they    
 make things to do with wood.  There   
 are lots of old houses that they are  
 doing up.  Most of them are painted   
 white now as the bricks are too old.  
 About 4OO people live in Lound.  There
 is a small chapel and a small         
 church,which is only open one Sunday a
 month.  A man in the village makes    
 fences.                               
                                       </content>
