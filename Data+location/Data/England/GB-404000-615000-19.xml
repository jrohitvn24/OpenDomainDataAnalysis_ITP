		<content> Apart from bicycles, the most common  
 vehicle owned by families in Powburn  
 area is the tractor. This is to be    
 expected in a farming area. A total of
 twentyone tractors were owned by five 
 families in our class. All these      
 tractors were used for work on the    
 farms.                                
                                       
 Only three families out of twelve     
 represented in our class had only one 
 car.All the other families had two    
 cars.Five families, in addition to    
 cars, also had landrovers or pick-ups.
                                       
 Noone in our class used public        
 transport regularly and a ride on a   
 bus is a very rare event for everyone.
 One girl went to Newcastle by bus with
 her Granny last holiday and another   
 person remembered a bus trip to       
 Edinburgh Zoo two years ago.          </content>
