		<content>{  Keighley}is an interesting place of 
 contrasts.  There's a{steam railway   
 with restored engines, the Keighley   
 &amp; Worth Valley Light Railway. The     
 stations on the line in our area are  
 Ingrow and Damems.                    
   Keighley is a very hilly town,      
 surrounded by moorland with a         
 picturesque valley.  Farms cover the  
 hillsides. {Dry-stone walls}were used 
 to split up the fields and you will   
 see dry-stone walls wherever you look.
 The stone for the walls was quarried  
 locally. There is also a lot of       
 woodland in this area.{ }             
   Keighley is not only a beautiful    
 town, it is also{industrial,} with    
 large{engineering works}and{housing   
{estates.  Textile  mills}were once    
 powered by{North Beck's}water.  There 
 is also a large {supermarket}in our   
 area.                                 </content>
