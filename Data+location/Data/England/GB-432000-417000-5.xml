 to turn the area into a {leisure area}
 and a{nature reserve.}                
 People are already (July 1985) using  
 the large lake for water skiing and   
 wind surfing, though this is illegal  
 because it is not yet controlled by   
 the Council. Water sports enthusiasts 
 have ignored fences.                  
 Trees have been planted. A kind of    
 reed called phragmites has been       
 planted in the small lake. Birds come 
 here for food, to breed, for          
 protection and on migration routes.   
 Some of the birds which use the lake  
 are Mute Swan, Canada Goose, Grebe,   
 Coot and Mallard.                     
 Rarer species seen in the area are    
 Kingfisher, Reed Warbler, Arctic Tern 
 and Black Throated Diver.
