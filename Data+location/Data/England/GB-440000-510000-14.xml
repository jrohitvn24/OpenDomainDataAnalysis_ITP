		<content>               On the 26th of June 1985
 between 10.35 a.m. and 11.14 a.m. one 
 hundred and fifty nine people,one bike
 and three dogs crossed over the High  
 Street.{Pelican crossings}are used to 
 get people across safely.             
                       A bridge over,or
 a subway under,the road could be built
 to save the time of car drivers and   
 shoppers.                             
          As the button was pressed 48 
 times in 39 minutes the average person
 crosses in less than a minute.        
                               In Yarm 
 there are two crossings, one near the 
 Town Hall and one near the Fish and   
 Chips shop but one bridge would be    
 suitable.
