		<title>14THE TRENT-MERSEY CANAL</title>
		<content> IN THE 1800 THE BARGES THAT WENT DOWN 
 THE CANAL,THAT CARIED GOODS SUCH AS   
 BEER,SILK,CLOTHES,FOOD,ETC,WERE PULLED
 BY HORSES.IT WAS A VERY SLOW PROGRESS.
 THE TRENT AND MERSEY IS AN EXTREEMLY  
 LONG CANAL.IT STARTS JUST OUTSIDE LONG
 EATON IT RUNS UP AND OVER THE RIVER   
 DOVE THROUGH BURTON AND THEN MAKES A  
 STOP.                                 
   MOST CANALS AROUND HAVE BEEN MAN    
 MADE BUY FERMS IN THE 1700.TO GET     
 TRANSPORT OF GOODS FROM ONE PLACE     
 ANOTHER.YOU COULD NOT LIVE IN A BARGE 
 ON THE CANAL UNTIL THE LATE 1800      
 BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL OPEN TOP BOATS  
 THE BARGES TOOK ALONG TIME GETTING    
 THROUGH THE LOCKS BECAUSE OF HOW SLOW 
 IT GOES FROM THE HIGH LEVEL OF THE    
 CANAL TO THE LOW LEVEL.KATHERN THE    
 GREAT USED THE CANALS FOR TAKING BEER 
 TO RUSSIA.
