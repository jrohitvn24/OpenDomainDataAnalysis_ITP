		<title>15  CHANGES IN THE BLOCK.</title>
		<content> The main change in the block has been 
 the construction of the new M.20      
 motorway as part of the London to     
 Dover link.Most people agree that     
 this has been beneficial.             
     In Lympne there is a new housing  
 estate which is still expanding and   
 also a new village hall.              
     Most people in Saltwood think that
 there has been little change in the   
 village,apart from individual house   
 building,in the last ten years.       
     The main social change in the     
 block,excluding Saltwood,has been the 
 change from being a rural             
 "living-of-the-land" community to that
 of a residential/dormitory area for   
 the surrounding towns.                
     Out of 75 people asked,only 3     
 worked in the block.
