		<content> Nearly every day of my life,when I am 
 on holiday at home , I get up and go  
 into the bathroom and get washed and  
 dressed. Then dad and I have breakfast
 and then we go to groom my pony and   
 take him down to his field. When we   
 come back we get our swimming costumes
 and then we go to the pool at         
 Christchurch. Bathing lasts an hour.We
 return for lunch at about twelve      
 thirty.After lunch I go to play on the
 swings by the stream.Later I help mum 
 in the garden.At four o'clock we walk 
 down to fetch the pony and on the way 
 we feed the chickens at grandads. Then
 I watch television until eight thirty 
 and then I go to bed.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
