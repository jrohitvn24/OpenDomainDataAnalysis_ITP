		<title>17BIRCHERLEY GREEN SHOP CENTRE</title>
		<content>   In the centre of{HERTFORD}a new     
 shopping centre was built in 1981 on  
 the site of an old bus station.The    
 name "{BIRCHERLEY GREEN}" derives from
{BUTCHERY GREEN}because the area had   
 once been used as a meat market.Large 
 shops like "Waitrose" ( a supermaket )
 ,"Boots" ( chemist ) and "Martins" (  
 newsagent )are mixed with smaller     
 outlets around a pedestrian walkway.It
 is a popular development although some
 shops have closed because of high     
 rents.A new bus station has been built
 at one end of the precinct.
