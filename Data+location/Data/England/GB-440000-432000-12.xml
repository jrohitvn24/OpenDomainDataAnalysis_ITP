		<title>12EDUCATION IN GARFORTH</title>
		<content> Children start school in a nursery at 
 about three years old, and finish     
 usually at sixteen at the             
 Comprehensive School. If they are     
 going on to college or university they
 stay at the Comprehensive School      
 till they are eighteen. There is only 
 one Comprehensive School and it has   
 over a thousand pupils. There are ten 
 Infant and Junior Schools each having 
 around two hundred pupils somewhere   
 between three and eleven years of age.
 Our own school, Ninelands Lane Junior 
 School, was built about twenty years  
 ago. It used to have around seven     
 hundred pupils. The oldest school in  
 Garforth is the Parochial School on   
 Main Street. It was built over two    
 hundred years ago and at that time was
 the only school in Garforth. It is now
 a Junior School.
