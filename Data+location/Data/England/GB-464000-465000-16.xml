		<content> Social concern is very evident in     
 Sheriff Hutton.Church groups have     
 rotas and visit the sick and troubled 
 on a regular basis.Generally people   
 are good neighbours and we have a     
 caring community.Visiting Doctors     
 hold twice weekly surgeries,there is  
 a monthly baby clinic also a          
 chiropidist-all held at the village   
 hall.Good Companions Club meets       
 weekly for the over 55's.A Christmas  
 party organised by church and chapel  
 is held annually for all over 60's of 
 the community,consisting of tea and   
 entertainment.Those too ill or infirm 
 to attend have their meal delivered.  
 The money required to fund this event 
 is raised by holding a bi-annual      
 auction.Sheriff Hutton Charities is a 
 trust administrated by a committee -  
 funds are for educational purposes -  
 also pensioners recieve a donation.   </content>
