 the house then we have lunch which    
 sometimes consists of fish &amp; chips on

 nappies I now do the next of the      
 washing.

 and get back just in time to stop me  
 from having a nervous breakdown,Sarah 
 is still pinching buns.Charlotte is by

 over doing the dinner.Everyone has to

 children go upstairs to play in their 
 bedroom or on the computer.Nearly     
 seven o'clock the best time of the    
 day.Sarah and Alan washed and ready
