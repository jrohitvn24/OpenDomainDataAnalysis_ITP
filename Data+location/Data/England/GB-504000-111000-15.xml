		<content> Crime Alert Scheme is a neighbourhood 
 watch scheme organised by the Sussex  
 Police. Residents report any          
 suspicious incident to their police   
 contact or in an emergency a 999      
 emergency call suffices. Window       
 stickers are provided for those       
 participationg in the scheme showing  
 the home is under serveillance. Some  
 minor vandelism occurs occasionally   
 but no serious disorders.             
 There are no yellow lines,            
 restrictions or Car Parks. Parked     
 vehicles often cause congestion on the
 narrow Rackham road. There are no     
 street lights or pavements.           
 There are no speed limits but on the  
 whole drivers are careful and very few
 accidents occur. Fortunately a law    
 abiding village!
