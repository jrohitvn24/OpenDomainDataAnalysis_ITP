		<title>10ASHGATE ANNEXE, ASHGATE</title>
		<content>  {Ashgate Annexe}closed in April 1984.
 Prior to this the Annexe was the      
 property of the{National Health       
{Service.}One building was a homely    
 maternity hospital whilst another, in 
 spacious grounds, comprised of two    
 wards for male and female patients who
 needed long term care. Many of the    
 patients were elderly, recovering from
 fractured hips, detained really       
 because they were too frail to return 
 to their own homes.                   
   During the 1984-5{Miner's Strike}the
 Annexe was used to billet Police      
 officers who were drafted from distant
 forces for picket duty. Currently one 
 half of the Annexe has been purchased 
 for an{old people's}home. It is hoped 
 that the other building will be used  
 as a{hospice}for the terminally ill.  
 This is the focus for much public fund
 raising in Chesterfield.              </content>
