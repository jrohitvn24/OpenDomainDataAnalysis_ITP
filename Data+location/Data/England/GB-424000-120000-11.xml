		<title>11North common lane</title>
		<content> Our lane is called North Common       
 Lane.The lane was used as a way of    
 avoiding paying a toll at Earldoms.The
 carriages went past our house,right   
 out of Scotland Lane,and back to      
 the main road.Our house is called     
 Cobweb Cottage and the house next door
 to us is called Hawkwind Cottage.These
 weren't the original names because our
 house was called North Common         
 Cottage.Our house used to be a shoe   
 makers house and before that a        
 gardener's house and before that a    
 farm worker's cottage.It used to be   
 two houses but now it is one.On the   
 old woodwork you can see nail marks   
 from where the tools were kept.The    
 house has a thatched roof and has two 
 original fireplaces.Our kitchen was   
 one cottage and measures 9 by 12 feet 
 with a bedroom above.
