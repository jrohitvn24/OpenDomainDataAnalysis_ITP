		<content> There is little of the eleventh       
 century church visible. Two impressive
 late Norman arches are present in the 
 nave, it being complete in early      
 English style together with a tower   
 and chancel. The clerestory, north and
 south arches are of the Perpendicular 
 period. There is a fine Medieval      
 timbered ceiling to the nave          
 ornanented with angels, shields and   
 bosses. The roof of the chancel is    
 nineteenth century. The prebendary    
 estate no longer exists having been   
 intergrated into the local farms and  
 grounds. Six acres of the churches    
 land are now the only remnants and are
 now under the control of the secular  
 'Parish meeting'. They are rented out 
 to local farmers. The parish is now   
 combined with those of Besthorpe and  
 Girton, and united into a single      
 benefice with the Collingham churches.</content>
