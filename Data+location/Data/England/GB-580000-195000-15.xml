		<content> ALTHOUGH THESE WERE THE MOST COMMON   
 CHILDRENS ACTIVITIES, MUSIC, SCOUTS,  
 GUIDES, CUBS ETC., WERE CONSISTENTLY  
 POPULAR PASTIMES. THE CHILDREN AND    
 ADULTS IN THE SURVEY FOR SOME REASON  
 DID NOT MENTION TELEVISION OR VIDEO AS
 A HOBBY OR INTEREST.                  
                                       
 THE WILLIAM DE FERRERS CENTRE PROVED  
 TO BE WELL USED BY BOTH ADULTS AND    
 CHILDREN ALIKE.                       
                                       
 IN HULLBRIDGE, THE RESIDENTS HAD TO   
 TRAVEL TO NEARBY HAWKWELL OR RAYLEIGH 
 FOR SPORT CENTRE FACILITIES.          
                                       
 THERE ARE NO SWIMMING POOL FACILITIES 
 IN S.W.F. OR HULLBRIDGE, IN SPITE OF  
 THE FACT, BOTH ARE RIVERSIDE TOWNS.
