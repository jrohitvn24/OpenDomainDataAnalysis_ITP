  We did a survey about HOLT FARM to   
find out about life on a farm. In 1984 
Mr Threlfall had 65 cows of which 40   
were milked and each produced 1170     
gallons of milk per year. 25 calves are
too young to be milked and are raised  
on the farm until they are old enough  
for milking. Mr Threlfall also buys    
milk from local dairies as there is not
enough from his cows. The cows are     
milked twice a day, at 06.30 and 17.00.
On the farm Mr Threlfall also cuts     
grass for silage. He puts the grass    
under a black plastic sheet to keep it 
for the winter feed. A farmer works all
through the year and does not go on    
many holidays because someone else has 
to look after the farm and the milk    
round.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
