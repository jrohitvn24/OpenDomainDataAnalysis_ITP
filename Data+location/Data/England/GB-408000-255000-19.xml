		<title>19MEDIEVAL MARKET</title>
		<content>   The rector,the right reverend Alan  
 Shaw opened Alcester's annual{Medieval
{Market}on Sunday 17th June.The High   
 Baliff and the Court Leet were there  
 in their finery.Stalls lined the High 
 Street selling various wares and were 
 manned by people dressed in medieval  
 costume.Many were dressed in elaborate
 rich costume and others in peasant    
 costume of the day.There were various 
 games to play and also a replica of   
 the stocks housing a local citizen.Wet
 sponges could be purchased and thrown.
 A reminder of punishments of bygone   
 days.                                 
      Each stall had to purchase a     
 licence from the council before they  
 could sell their wares on market day. 
 Many of the stalls were run for       
 charity and made up the funds of the  
 High Baliff's charity.
