		<title>10WATERFORD MARSH</title>
		<content>      Waterford Marsh is one of the    
 most attractive places on the North   
 side of Hertford.  With the River     
 Beane meandering through it is popular
 for walks, in spite of the fact that  
 it is waterlogged during periods of   
 wet weather.                          
     There is an abundance of animal   
 and bird life on the marsh.  The most 
 noticable birds are the aggressive    
 Mute Swans, Moorhens and the Grey     
 Heron.  Rabbits have colonised the    
 railway embankment in large numbers   
 and are much in evidence.             
      An interesting new feature of the
 Marsh is the Tree Nursery which opened
 a couple of years ago.  This is       
 situated between the North bank of the
 Beane and the Stevenage road.
