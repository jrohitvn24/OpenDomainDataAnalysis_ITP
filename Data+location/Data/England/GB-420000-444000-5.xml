 Buttercross.This building has been    
 standing since medieval times.It is   
 now used as a place for selling items 
 for charity.                          
 The oldest Agricultural Show in       
 England is the Otley Show which has   
 been held since 1796 every May.       
  Every Easter a large wooden cross is 
 placed on top of the Chevin.          
 The Market which has been coming to   
 Otley for 900 years still comes on    
 Fridays and Saturdays.The Market still
 stands next to the Buttercross selling
 cheap items.                          
  The Maypole which used to stand on   
 the Cross Green opposite the Civic    
 Centre does no longer exist as the    
 Cross Green was recently made into a  
 car park.
