		<title>10SECONDARY SCHOOL SURVEY</title>
		<content>OVER 80% OF ALL CHILDREN BETWEEN THE   
AGES OF 11 AND 16 IN OUR AREA ATTEND A 
SECONDARY MODERN SCHOOL.AS AN EXAMPLE  
OF THIS TYPE OF SCHOOL WE LOOKED AT    
BEVERLEY BOYS SCHOOL.                  
IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS AT BEVERLEY   
PUPILS TAKE A BROADLY BASED CURRICULUM 
TO ALLOW THEM TO CHOOSE "OPTION"       
SUBJECTS AT THE END OF THE THIRD YEAR. 
MOST PUPILS THEN CONCENTRATE ON EIGHT  
SUBJECTS WHICH MUST INCLUDE ENGLISH AND
MATHEMATICS.IN MOST CASES THESE COURSES
LEAD TO PUBLIC EXAMINATIONS AT C.S.E.  
OR G.C.E."O" LEVEL.THESE EXAMINATIONS  
TAKE PLACE AT THE END OF THE FIFTH YEAR
AFTER WHICH MOST STUDENTS LEAVE SCHOOL.
SOME STUDENTS THEN RETURN TO SCHOOL TO 
FOLLOW ONE OR TWO YEAR COURSES IN THE  
SIXTH FORM.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
