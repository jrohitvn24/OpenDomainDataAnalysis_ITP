		<title>12The bypass -good or bad ?</title>
		<content> The bypass road to take traffic away  
 from the village has been  wanted for 
 years but it has not been known       
 whether it would go on the St.Dennis  
 or Newquay side of Indian Queens.In   
 May 1985 rumours began to get about   
 that the route for the bypass would   
 start from the Kelliers and cut across
 below the school behind the Suncrest  
 Estate.This would mean that the A392  
 road joining Indian Queens to St.     
 Columb Road would have to have a      
 flyover or an underpass,and that the  
 two places would be divided.The school
 would be on one side,with the council 
 estate on the other as well as the    
 houses and shops at St.Columb Road.A  
 farm and bungalow would have to be    
 knocked down in St.Francis Road to    
 make way for the new road.Plans are   
 due to be shown in Spring 1986,and    
 there could be trouble.               </content>
