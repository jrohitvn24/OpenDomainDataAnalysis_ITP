		<content>{ (The Lodge)}                         
 This is a lodge which was originally  
 built as the gatehouse for Vale Royal 
 Abbey, but now it is used as a        
 cottage.  The building is not very    
 big, but the owners are not allowed to
 extend more than once and this has    
 already happened when the previous    
 owners built the lounge.  They had to 
 acquire sandstone from Cumbria because
 the material had to be exactly the    
 same as the original building.  This  
 is because the Department of the      
 Environment is preserving the Lodge as
 a piece of historical evidence.  The  
 Lodge is situated at the end of the   
 long drive from the Abbey.
