		<title>10FARMING</title>
		<content>We interviewed one of the farmers who  
live and work in Dagnall.He had lived  
in Dagnall for 60 years and had        
inherited the farm from his father.The 
farm covers about 88 acres of ground   
used mainly for growing cereal crops   
and potatoes.In the yard of the farm he
keeps a few chickens for their eggs but
no other livestock. He employs his son 
and a few local people to work for him 
although this changes with the seasons 
as there is more work to do in the     
summer when he normally works a 12 hour
day.He is a man of habit and always    
gets up at 6.00 hours in the morning   
even in the winter.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
