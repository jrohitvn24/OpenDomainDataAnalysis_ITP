		<content>   The information about Choppington   
 was gathered and compiled by the      
 children in classes 4 and 5 and the   
 teachers of Choppington  First School 
 during the summer of 1985.            
   Grateful thanks are given to those  
 members of the community who gave     
 their time to help the children in    
 this project. Special thanks also to  
 Miss C. Atkinson who helped with the  
 amenities count and took numerous     
 slides for our use.
