  On the North bank of the River Wear, 
 next to Penshaw Bridge at Fatfield,is 
 a small mound known as Worm Hill.It is
 said to be the hill around which the  
 Lambton Worm "wrapped his tail ten    
 times."There is now a war memorial on 
 the top.                              
{The River Wear                        
  The source of the Wear is at Wearhead
 in North Durham and its mouth at      
 Sunderland.In Durham city its great   
 meanders encircle the Norman Castle   
 and Cathedral.                        
{Penshaw Monument                      
  Although not in this survey area the 
 monument can be seen from all parts.It
 was built by the tenants of a previous
 Lord Lambton who wanted to honour a   
 generous landlord.However,the Lord,   
 thinking they must be rich,raised the 
 rent.The building remains incomplete. </content>
