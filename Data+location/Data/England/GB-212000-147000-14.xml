		<title>14The Boat Trip (continued).</title>
		<content> We carried on North past Gannets Rock 
 and we saw Guillimots,Razor Bills,    
 Shags and Kittiwakes. When we got to  
 Seals Rock I saw another Puffin in the
 water.Then I saw a rock sticking out  
 of the water with a peculiar grey     
 flabby thing on it.It was a Grey Seal 
 pup.Then I had the fright of my life, 
 we suddenly shot out to sea,we had to 
 go far out because of the rocks on the
 N.W.Point. When we finally slowed down
 we were on the windward side (the     
 west) of the island at St.James Stone.
 There wasn't so much to see on this   
 side,except in Jenny's Cove where we  
 saw thousands of birds:Guillimots,    
 Kittiwakes,Razorbills,Shags and       
 Great Black-backed Gulls.We carried on
 past Battery Point and Montagu Steps. 
 Then we got to Black Rock and I had a 
 fright again as we went fast round the
 corner into Rattles Anchorage.(cont.) </content>
