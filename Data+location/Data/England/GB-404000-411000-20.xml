		<content> In the last 20 years the mills have   
 gone out of business in the D-block   
 area.A new radio mast was bulit at    
 Pole Moor to replace the old one.A    
  society is also trying to re-open the
 canal  from Marsden to Huddersfield.  
 This is supposed to take 15           
 years.Slaithwaite now has a leisure   
 centre and a swimming bath which was  
 opened in the sixties. Marsden has    
 a railway station and Slaithwaite had 
 one opened in 1983. Before motorised  
 transport people used to travel by    
 horse and cart down and up the        
 valley.The main road running through  
 the area is the A62 which used to be  
 one of the main roads across the      
 Pennines.In the early 1970's the      
 trans-Pennine motorway the M62 was    
 opened.{
