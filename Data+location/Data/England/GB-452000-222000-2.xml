		<title>02 MIDDLETON PARK</title>
		<content>    Middleton Park stands on the       
original site of the earlier Manor     
house(s).It was built in 1938 and was  
designed by Sir Edwin and Mr:Robert    
Lutyens.The entrance hall is similar in
design to the Viceroy's residence in   
Delhi(INDIA).The house is seperate     
from the Jersey Estate and is owned by 
the Davenport family.The grounds are   
limited by the 'Ha-Ha'(an empty        
ditch).The rear of the house faces     
south with open views of the           
surrounding countryside.All the        
windows on the south side are          
shuttered and a special feature was    
two low-level windows (for the children
to look out)called nurseries.The       
dumbbells,a Lutyens feature, were      
carved in stone outside and wood       
inside.Another impressive feature is   
the teak finished staircase.The        
house is not open to the public.       </content>
