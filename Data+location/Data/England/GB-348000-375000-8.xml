		<title>08HELSBY HILL RACES</title>
		<content> The original hill races were held as  
 an athletic event many years ago but  
 stopped in l957.  They were           
 restarted two years ago to raise funds
 for a new scout hut.  The races are   
 sponsored by local firms whose names  
 are acknowledged in the titles of     
 various trophies.  There are races for
 boys, youths, men and women and there 
 are also team races.  Many local      
 people participate encouraged by      
 special awards for locals.  Teams also
 compete from as far away as Leeds,    
 Halifax and Bolton.  The races are run
 under A.A.A. and W.A.A.A.rules.  The  
 races start and finish at the Public  
 Playing Fields in Lower Robin Hood    
 Lane where local organisations are    
 encouraged to hold stalls and fund    
 raising activities.
