		<title>20Starlight Castle</title>
		<content> A long time ago, a member of the      
 Delaval Family wanted to bring a lady 
 to his estate from a diffirent area.  
 Blake Delaval's friend bet him he     
 could not build a castle in 24 hours  
 for her to stay in. The man thought   
 for a while and decided, being a      
 crafty sort to build the miniature    
 Starlight Castle. It was finished     
 within a day, and so the two married. 
 It got its name from the starlight    
 which helped the builders carry on at 
 night. Today only one and a bit walls 
 are left and these could crumble at   
 any minute.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
