		<title>17THE LOOSE SWISS SCOUTS</title>
		<content> The Loose Swiss Scout Group was       
 started in 1908 by 'Skipper' Jack     
 Barcham Green. The name 'Swiss' comes 
 from the connections he had with      
 Switzerland through both his family   
 hand-made paper-making business and   
 also his marriage into a Swiss family.
 The Group's HQ in Pickering Street was
 bought for Â£125 in 1942. More recently
 the Group was given the chance to buy 
 45 acres of the Loose Valley for      
 Â£25,000 by the landowner Miss Joan    
 Foster Clarke. In 1982, with the      
 purchase completed, the land was named
 Swiss Valley and dedicated in the     
 presence of 97-year old 'Skipper'     
 Green. Since when members and         
 supporters of the Group have worked   
 hard on a programme of management and 
 conservation, and the land has been   
 used for a wide range of scouting     
 activities.                           </content>
