		<title>14CHANGES THAT EFFECT LIFE</title>
		<content>   In the early 1960's,the Grand Union 
{Canal }was drained.The area is now    
 used for grazing of livestock,but it  
 course can still seen.                
  The coming of Milton Keynes to the   
 area meant that there were many       
 changes.                              
  At Thornton College the coming of    
{computers}is a new area in teaching   
 for the girls. Also a new sports hall 
 has been built, which is to be opened 
 in July.As well as the{sports}hall    
 other buildings have been built.      
  At Thornborough Mill old{ barns}are  
 being converted into houses.Many barns
 in the area are not being             
 converted,but left derelict while     
 newer barns are being used.           
  The owners of Thornborough Grounds   
 now have less land.This is because    
 they  sold some land three years ago.
