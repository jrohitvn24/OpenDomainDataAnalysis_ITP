		<content>                                       
 In the morning my daddy woke me up and
 I got washed and dressed then I went  
 down stairs and had a cup of tea. Then
 it was 8.30 about time to go to       
 school.I got my school things and got 
 in the car and daddy took me. When I  
 got to school some of my friends were 
 already there so we played a game     
 until the bell went at 8.55.Then we   
 went in side and had hymn practice    
 after this we were told our week's    
 work and we started on it.We have been
 doing a project about famous          
 musicians. In mathematics we have been
 investigating cuboids. At dinner time 
 I went to the hall and ate the meal   
 prepared by Mrs. Palmer in the school 
 kitchen. It was roast pork, potatoes, 
 carrots and cabbage followed by       
 marshmallow tart.
