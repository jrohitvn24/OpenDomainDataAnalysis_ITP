		<title>14Day in the life of Samantha</title>
		<content>I awoke at 7am and got ready for       
school.I went downstairs,had my        
breakfast then went out of the house at
9.15am because the school did not open 
until 10am on that particular day.I    
went to call for my friend and caught  
the bus to school and met Stephanie.   
  We have to wear a uniform.The main   
colours consist of blue,grey,black and 
white.We were divided into different   
forms which spell out the name         
WILLFIELD eg. 1W,1I,1L,1F,1E and 1D.   
  We had the register called,my first  
lesson was maths,followed by craft.At  
dinner we are allowed 1 hour and 15    
minutes.The next lesson was swimming   
followed by geography.                 
  At 3.55pm it was time to go home.I   
first did my homework then had         
something to eat at 9.00pm.After that  
I went to bed.
