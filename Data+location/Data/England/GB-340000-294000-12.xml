		<title>12THE FLINT FLAKE</title>
		<content> When we got back we went to{Rowleys   
{Mansion Museum}in Shrewsbury to tell  
 Mr Bennison an archeologist we were   
 doing a {BBC Domesday Project}and     
 asked him to identify our flint. He   
 had a good look and told us that it   
 was definitely flint. Then he showed  
 us some more flint found near Lower   
 Darnford Farm.He said that our{flake  
 was probably off a large piece which  
 had been made into something like an  
 axehead or an arrowhead.
