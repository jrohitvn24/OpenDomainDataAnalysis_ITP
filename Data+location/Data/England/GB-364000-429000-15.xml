		<title>15The Dual Carriageway</title>
		<content> The Dual Carriageway is a very busy   
 road .In just five minutes one hundred
 and six cars, fifteen lorries. fifteen
 vans including a mobile library, two  
 buses and one bicycle passed the      
 Knowles Arms car park at the end of   
 Pleckgate Road.                       
 The road number is  the A6119, a trunk
 road with a length of about seven and 
 a half kilometres. It runs from the   
 A677 near the Moat House Hotel,       
 through Brownhill Roundabout, past St 
 Gabriels Church and Blackburn Cemetry 
 where it meets the A679.              
 It is a dangerous junction near the   
 Knowles Arms public house and there   
 have been quite a few crashes. Coming 
 up from Brownhill there are only two  
 lanes but after a few hundred         
 metres the road enlarges to four      
 lanes. In the middle of the road in   
 some places are grassy areas.         </content>
