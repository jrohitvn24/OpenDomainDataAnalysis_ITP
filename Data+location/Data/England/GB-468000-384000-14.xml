		<title>14A Day in the Life of Fiona</title>
		<content> On Fridays I get up at 7. o'clock.  I 
 have toast for my breakfast.  I feed  
 my fish and then I hang the washing   
 out for my Mum if it is not raining.  
 At half past eight my Mum drives me to
 school.  We go into school at quarter 
 to nine and have assembly.  We have   
 maths before playtime and then do     
 topic work afterwards.  We have our   
 lunch at quarter to twelve and then   
 play outside until one o'clock.  In   
 the afternoon we go swimming at       
 Retford Sports Centre.  We finish our 
 swimming session at two o'clock and go
 back to school on a coach.  At school 
 we read until home-time.  I then go to
 another swimming training session.  I 
 get home at about six o'clock and have
 my tea.  I am very tired.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
