		<title>01Holwick and Newbiggin</title>
		<content> Here the turbulent river Tees tumbles 
 over cascades and thrusts through     
 rocky gorges. North of the river lies 
 Newbiggin. Once a busy leadmining and 
 smelting community but now consisting 
 merely of a group of farms and        
 cottages. Those belonging to the Raby 
 Estates are traditionally white       
 washed. To the south nestles Holwick, 
 a scattering of sheltered farms on    
 ridges of well drained glacial moraine
 dwarfed by the dramatic steep faulted 
 whinstone cliffs of Holwick Scars.    
 Above the crags stretch vast grouse   
 moors. The only road to the village   
 passes remnants of the natural forests
 of Teesdale and ends at Holwick  Hall,
 a shooting lodge on the Strathmore    
 Estates. As well as sheep grouse are  
 economically important on the moors   
 and tenants are obliged to provide    
 beaters during the shooting season.   </content>
