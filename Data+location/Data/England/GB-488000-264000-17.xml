Television occupied children for the   
greatest amount of their leisure time. 
Some children watched an average of    
two and a half hours each week day and 
three and a half at the week end. Many 
children had a video at home which     
enabled them to hire videos. They seem 
to watch the same video several times. 
Computers were available in many homes 
and some children had become addicted  
to games like 'Frogger'. BMX bikes are 
the craze in the summer evenings with  
most children performing tricks on the 
quiet estate roads. Snooker has become 
very popular as a result of television 
coverage. The tables seem to have taken
over the family garage. The older boys 
go fishing in the River Nene usually   
unaccompanied by an adult. There seemed
to be very few family outings with them
taking place every other month.        </content>
