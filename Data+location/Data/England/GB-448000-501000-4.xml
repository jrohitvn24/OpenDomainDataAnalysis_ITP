		<content>{Planning.}The N.York Moors National   
 Park is the planning authority as this
 is a conservation area. Some of its   
 rulings are questionable, i.e.,       
 insistence on a two-storey building   
 replacing a bungalow on exposed high  
 ground. The local parish council can  
 study applications and make recommend-
 ations.{Housing styles.}Faceby Lane   
 leading into Carlton has, on one side,
 14 council houses built in the 1940s  
 and opposite these the Crescent, half 
 of them elegant houses built early    
 this century and, the other half,     
 modern executive-type dwellings of the
 '70s and '80s. In Whorlton a local    
 builder has skilfully blended matching
 stone in an extension to a cottage    
 built in 1812. His family have been   
 local stone-masons for more than two  
 centuries, passing their skills from  
 from father to son.                   </content>
