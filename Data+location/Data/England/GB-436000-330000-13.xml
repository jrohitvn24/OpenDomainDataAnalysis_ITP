		<title>13Allenton Sports Ground,Derby</title>
		<content> Allenton has a patch of land called   
 the Municipal Sports Ground. It has a 
 big all weather running track and a   
 patch of grass in the middle where    
 football teams play. The grass is also
 used for hammer throwing and for      
 javelin. There is a small stand for   
 spectators. For the past two years    
 Derby has held its own marathon event,
 called the Ramathon, which starts and 
 finishes at this ground.              
   The ground is used by local         
 athletics clubs. Large sporting events
 like the national Asian Games are also
 held here. Our school, Allenton       
 Primary, holds its annual Sports Day  
 on this track. We have flat and relay 
 races for boys and girls, skipping    
 races for the girls only and sack     
 races for the boys only. We also have 
 a "Mums and Dads" race.
