		<title>04Ecology - Climate.</title>
		<content> The climate of the area can best be   
 described as cool and moist. The      
 average annual rainfall at a small    
 reservoir 3km. north of Windermere is 
 approx. 1650mm. per annum but, in     
 practice, such figures have little    
 meaning. The 'summer' of 1985 is      
 turning out to be one of the worst on 
 record. Temperatures and sunshine     
 hours are well below average while the
 number of days with rain is well      
 above. This contrasts with 1984 which 
 had one of the worst droughts on      
 record. Rain fell on only five days   
 between late April and the end of     
 August and there were frequent spells 
 of several days with unbroken         
 sunshine.  Winters can vary similarly.
 The last one had only 7 days when snow
 fell and was not noted for cold       
 spells. Weather is much less severe in
 winter than 'offcomers' imagine.      </content>
