		<title>03Foxhall Stadium,    Kesgrave</title>
		<content>   Foxhall Stadium is in  our area.  It
is where the motor-cycle speedway races
take place.  The Â£Ipswich Witches' ride
there and they  are  one  of  the  best
teams in England.                      
   The stadium  can  hold 10,000 people
and each meeting is  attended by 1000 -
10,000 people.   The  stadium was built
in  1953  and  before  that it was just
heathland.  The stadium covers about 25
acres with heathland all around it.    
   Five  people  work  full-time at the
stadium  and  between  50 and 100  work
there part-time.                       
   There  are  three  stands  and it is
possible to buy food  and  refreshments
at the race meetings.   Everyone enjoys
watching and finds  it  very  exciting.
   It  is  a  dangerous  sport  and the
worst accident  was  when  someone  was
killed.    The  fences  round the track
have to be repaired quite often.       </content>
