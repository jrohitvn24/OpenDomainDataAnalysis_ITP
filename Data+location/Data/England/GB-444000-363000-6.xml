		<title>06THE HALL AT HARDWICK</title>
		<content>  Tens of thousands flock each year to 
{Hardwick Hall,}which has been owned   
 since 1959 by the{National Trust.}It  
 was built in the late sixteenth       
 century by{"Bess of Hardwick"         
 (Elizabeth Dowager Countess of        
 Shrewsbury). It is a grand and        
 impressive building, still richly     
{decorated}and splendidly{furnished.   
  One of the Hall's great features is  
 its large proportion of window to     
 wall. The windows increase            
 progressively in height from the      
 ground upwards.This reflects the      
 interior arrangement-servants         
 quarters, then family apartments and  
 then state rooms.This vertical        
 emphasis is further increased by the  
 presence of six towers, on top of     
 which the initials{"E.S."}proudly     
 stand- perhaps erected lest we should 
 forget the lady behind it all!        </content>
