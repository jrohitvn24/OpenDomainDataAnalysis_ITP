   Dilhorne School was first built in  
the church yard of All Saints Church   
in the reign of Henry VIII, a free     
school and intended for the benefit of 
that parish by providing a stipend for 
the schoolmaster to teach the science  
of grammar.When in the late 1870's the 
school moved to its present location   
it became an Elementary School.        
                                       
   The Trust established then          
continues today, administered by a     
committee of local people, guided by   
its secretary who is a solicitor.Only  
the interest from the capital can be   
spent,firstly on the building and then 
on grants awarded to members of the    
village who attend any form of higher  
education over the age of sixteen.Each 
year the school also receives financial
help towards the childrens education.  </content>
