		<title>11Villagers must own cars</title>
		<content>   About 92% of people own a car. On   
 average they travel 155 miles per week
 in order to live comfortably. The     
 average villager travels 73 miles per 
 week just to go to work, one topped   
 500 miles, but he was a representative
 and, as 55% of workers commute, such  
 mileage is reasonable. Each family    
 will on average travel 27 miles to    
 shop, which is esential    if they are
 to secure relatively cheap, varied    
 food. there is no entertainment on our
 'D' block, and so on average people   
 expect to travel 33 mile every week   
 for fun. People felt that car         
 ownership is essential in such an     
 isolated rural area where only a very 
 limited bus service to Sturminster    
 Newton exists. The scattered nature of
 settlement often determines the use of
 a car just to visit friends.
