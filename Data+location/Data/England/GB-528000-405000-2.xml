		<title>02A SUMMARY OF THE BLOCK 2.</title>
		<content>   A new road is planned to by-pass New
 Waltham,and also provide another route
 into Grimsby.The new road into Grimsby
 will be built on the disused railway. 
   Although there is mostly farmland   
 and some residential areas in the     
 block there is a small industrial     
 estate.                               
   In the north of the area is Weelsby 
 Woods, a public park. It has large    
 open grassed areas and extensive      
 mature mixed native tree areas. The   
 woods are a popular walking area but  
 the grassed areas are often spoiled by
 dog faeces. A Picnic area is being    
 developed which is proving very       
 popular along with a 'keep fit' area. 
   Private housing in the north of the 
 block is dominated by bungalows and   
 there are extensive council house     
 developments.
