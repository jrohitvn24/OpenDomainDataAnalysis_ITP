		<title>17FARMING.</title>
		<content>   There are{17}major farms in our     
 block and{4}of these together total   
 970 acres,divided into over 100       
 fields. These are mixed farms growing 
 Barley, Wheat and supporting{200}dairy
 cows. The milk goes to Stonehouse     
 dairy. Between them they have{150}Beef
 cattle.                               
   There are two large fruit farms one 
 specialising in the production of     
 cider apples sent to Bulmers at       
 Hereford and other soft fruit drinks, 
 and the other farm in soft fruit      
 production -rasberries,strawberries   
 for retail.All farms have tractors,   
 trailers, mowers and spinners.The     
 problems with the land are:-The soil  
 is to sandy,several banks, many       
 irregular shaped fields, very hungry  
 soil, and too much gradient for Arable
 farming.                              
                                       </content>
