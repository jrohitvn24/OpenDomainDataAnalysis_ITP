{Housing                               
 The style of building in the area     
 varies considerably from neo Georgian 
 styles and post war council housing to
 older Victorian terraces, cottages and
 farm houses. The majority of the      
 housing in the area is owner occupied 
 and includes two small estates of     
 former RAF married quarters which are 
 now privately owned. The rented       
 accommodation in the area includes    
 houses owned by the District Council  
 and one Sheltered Housing Unit for the
 elderly and several cottages owned by 
 local farmers.
