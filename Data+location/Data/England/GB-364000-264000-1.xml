		<title>01HILL TOP, S.E. OF TENBURY</title>
		<content> Agriculture accounts for the majority 
 of land use in the area, encompassing 
 most types, including arable, dairy,  
 beef, sheep and a little market       
 gardening. There are a number of apple
 and cherry orchards in the area, some 
 of which have only been planted in the
 last decade, although others are much 
 older and less productive. there are a
 number of farms in the area, of       
 various sizes; Hill Top being one of  
 the larger ones which the Gough family
 have farmed for the last 20 years.    
 Most of the stock is transported to   
 markets at nearby Tenbury, which is   
 only 4 miles away, or to Worcester or 
 Kidderminster, both of which are a    
 distance of about 16 miles. there is a
 wide variety in the housing in the    
 area including a number of farmhouses,
 renovated farm cottages and some      
 relatively new housing developments   </content>
