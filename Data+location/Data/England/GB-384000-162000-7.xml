		<content> Primary education is covered by two   
 schools. St Marys Broughton Gifford   
 still has connections with the church 
 and although numbers have decreased it
 still caters for about 70 children in 
 3 classes. There are 3 full time      
 teachers, one being the headmaster,   
 and one part-time teacher. Holt Church
 of England school has 99 pupils in 4  
 classes with 4 full time teachers and 
 one part-time.                        
 Three secondary schools serve this    
 area, pupils from St Marys go to      
 George Ward School at Melksham. Pupils
 from Holt can elect to attend either  
 Clarendon School at Trowbridge or St  
 Lawrence at Bradford-on-Avon, each    
 being five miles away.                
 Pre-school education is covered by the
 playgroups. Adult education locally is
 restricted to soft furnishing and keep
 fit.                                  </content>
