		<content>  { Batcombe church}is large. Today    
 the church worship reflects the three 
 strata that make up the village.{     
{Farming,}reinforced by an increasing  
 number of{retired people}has lead to a
 traditional form of worship. The third
 strand is{artisan}and{commuters}with  
 young families and these have enabled 
 the church to include{fresh ways of   
{worship.}Thus the church tries to help
 its people to make sense of their     
 lives and offer God thanks in a way   
 that is meaningful and yet wide enough
 to span their experience.             
   {Upton Noble church}is small. Again 
 very traditional with services in the 
 'old language' but a strong element,  
 provided by young families, worship   
 using the newest form of 'simplified  
 language'. No polarity is caused by   
 the different ways of worship but a   
 desire to find a richer unity.        </content>
