		<content>      The West Dorset Heritage Coast   
 includes all the coastline of this    
 area with the exception of West Bay.  
 The National Trust owns much of the   
 coastal area of West Dorset, including
 the undercliffs to the east of Eype   
 Mouth. Both of these organisations    
 help to protect this coastline from   
 unsightly developments resulting from 
 tourism.                              
      From a natural history point of  
 view the undercliffs west of West Bay 
 are an important natural conservation 
 area. Wild plants can grow and        
 creatures can live with little human  
 interference because of the regular   
 landslips and cliff falls.            
      The Dorset Coast Path follows the
 cliff top of this coastline and is    
 regularly used throughout the year,   
 but especially by tourists during the 
 summer period.                        </content>
