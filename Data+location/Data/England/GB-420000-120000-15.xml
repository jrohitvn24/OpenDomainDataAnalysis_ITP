		<title>15A Day at Redlynch School</title>
		<content> I get up at 06.30, breakfast at 07.30 
 and arrive at school just before      
 09.00.School starts with a half hour  
 assembly and after that we usually do 
 mathematics, writng and formal work   
 until lunch at 12.00 with a morning   
 break at 10.30.                       
   Lunch break lasts until 13.30 and   
 during that time we play rounders,    
 touch and cricket and go to clubs run 
 by the teachers. In the afternoon we  
 do topic work, craft and sports until 
 15.30.                                
    Quite often Mr Spring reads to us  
 and we frequently spend a period in   
 silent reading.                       
   After school on Mondays I go to     
 Salisbury Swimming Club from 18.00 to 
 19.00 and I usually go to bed and read
 until 21.00.
