		<title>20The North Devon Linkroad</title>
		<content> Mr. and Mrs.Joannes live at Filleigh  
 Station which is an old station that  
 has been converted to a bungalow.They 
 have two children,Katherine who goes  
 to South Molton School and David who  
 goes to Filleigh School.              
 The Department of Transport proposes  
 that the South Molton to Barnstaple   
 section of the N.Devon Linkroad should
 use the route of the old railway line 
 which will mean that their house will 
 have to be demolished.                
 The Joannes are fighting these        
 plans.They have sold square metres of 
 their garden to people all over the   
 world to make the serving of          
 compulsory purchase orders difficult. 
 A public enquiry will eventually      
 decide which route the road wiil take.
