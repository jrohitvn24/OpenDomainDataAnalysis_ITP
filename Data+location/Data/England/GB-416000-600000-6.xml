		<content> In 1980 Felton Primary School became a
 First School. The spare classroom was 
 then used as a community room. There  
 is a Nursery class 4 half days, a     
 Pre-school Playgroup, a Mother and    
 Toddler group 1 morning a week and a  
 Baby Clinic on alternate Wednesdays.  
 The health visitor,doctor and nurse   
 are at the baby clinic. The babies are
 weighed and get injections. The       
 mothers can buy baby foods.  In the   
 Mother and Toddler group there are    
 about 10 mothers and their children.  
 They have coffee and talk and the     
 children play. The Playgroup is run by
 a rota of 4 mothers and a leader. The 
 children aged 2-4 years do painting   
 baking and cutting out. It is like a  
 nursery without  a teacher.  The      
 Brownies, Cubs and Guides each meet   
 once a week at the school.
