		<title>06Grandma's Day- Spennymoor.</title>
		<content> I got up at 8 am, made myself a cup of
 tea, had a bath, got dressed, made    
 breakfast for myself and my husband,  
 had a look at the daily paper, washed 
 the breakfast dishes and then tidied  
 up the living room and kitchen. Next I
 made the dinner and again washed up,  
 before going shopping with my friend. 
 As it was Gala day in Spennymoor we   
 stood and watched the jazz bands,     
 floats and vintage cars. After this we
 shopped and were ready for a cup of   
 tea, so off we went to a snack bar    
 before catching the bus home. I       
 then made the tea, washed up, had a   
 rest, and watched the tennis on the   
 television. By now it was 7pm so I    
 went round to our communal hall and   
 had a game of Bingo.After supper I sat
 and watched the film until bedtime. I 
 put the milk bottles out pulled all   
 the plugs out and locked up.          </content>
