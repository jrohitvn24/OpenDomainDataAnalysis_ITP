		<title>16Social Concerns-Gleadless</title>
		<content> One major concern is the future of    
 education.Frecheville comprehensive   
 school is due to be amalgamated with  
 Thornbridge comprehensive school.There
 is also a threat to close Frecheville 
 Infant and Basegreen Junior schools.  
 Another concern was the need for safe 
 places for children to play.          
 The area would benefit from a sports  
 club,more job centres and pension     
 clubs. There was a general comment for
 even more foot patrols by the police. 
 Fear of burglaries-amongst old        
 people was of particular concern.     
 Anxiety about the volume of traffic on
 the main roads,not only due to the    
 increased incidence of accidents but  
 also in terms of pollution.           
 One 17 year old girl said that she was
 concerned that the City Council would 
 be hindered in maintaining services   
 because of pressure from Central Govt.</content>
