		<content>    There are four Christian Churches  
 on Yarm Road.   They are: St. Peter's 
 (Church of England), St. Cuthbert's   
 (Roman Catholic), Yarm Road Methodist 
 and the United Reformed Church.       
    The Clergy from the four churches  
 hold regular meetings with each other.
 This is to enable them all to better  
 serve the interests of their          
 respective congregations.   Regular   
 joint Church Services are held.       
    These churches have considerable   
 involvement with youth groups, such as
 Guides and Brownies, Scouts and Cubs  
 and the Boys' Brigade.   The Clergy   
 also work pastorally with young and   
 old throughout their parishes.
