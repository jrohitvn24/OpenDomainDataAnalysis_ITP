		<title>11 Quaker's End</title>
		<content> The White House was originally called 
Quaker's End and is probably the oldest
house in Holywell Row. The present     
owner and her daughter bought the house
18 years ago when they moved from      
Dublin, Ireland. The site dates back   
500 years and the front wall of the    
house is the original one that was     
built 300 years ago. In the lounge the 
fireplace is very old and is made of   
some of the original bricks. There are 
beamed ceilings throughout the house   
and all the windows are leaded. The    
entrance to the house has been made    
from the original stable doors.        
 There is an old barn behind the house 
which also dates back 500 years. Both  
buildings have been re-roofed and the  
original thatch removed. An old        
picture of the house as it appeared    
long ago, is kept in the Methodist     
Chapel.                                </content>
