		<content> Ernest Doe &amp; Sons Ltd. started in 1900
 as a small blacksmith and has grown to
 one of the largest agricultural,      
 commercial and construction machinery 
 companies in the country. The firm has
 eleven branches with a turnover in    
 excess of Â£30 million. The head office
 just outside Hatfield Peverel covers  
 eleven and a half acres. They have    
 their own show in February each year  
 and are one of the main exhibitors at 
 the Essex show in July. The total     
 workforce in the group is             
 approximately 400, and those employed 
 at head office all live locally. The  
 company encourages local schools to   
 participate in work experience and    
 employs a number of apprentices. The  
 management at present is considering  
 expanding into the export field.
