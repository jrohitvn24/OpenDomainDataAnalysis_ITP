		<content> There has been a manor house near the 
 confluence of the rivers Tees and     
 Greta for centuries.  The present one 
 was built in 1735 and has served as   
 the family home of the Morritt family,
 who own the surrounding estate, almost
 all of that time.                     
 Times and life-styles change.  The    
 house is far too large for a modern   
 family and its maintenance too costly.
 With the aid of a grant from the      
 Historic Buildings Fund, essential    
 work is being undertaken.  In return  
 the house will be open to the public  
 from 1986.                            
 Thus the house will again be alive.   
 It will be part family home, part     
 showcase of an age that is past, but  
 from time to time it will be filled   
 with people and provide employment for
 guides and others as it did in the    
 past.                                 </content>
