		<title>12THE LOCAL COUNCIL</title>
		<content> Lancaster City Council covers 218.4   
 miles including the area around       
 Wennington; its population is 118,589 
 with an annual turnover of about      
 Â£200,000,000. The council has 60      
 members. Although there are 38        
 Conservative councillors, voting,     
 which is on a show of hands, tends to 
 be done on personal rather than party 
 grounds. Each member may claim an     
 attendance allowance and on average   
 spends 59 hours a month on council    
 work. Meetings take place every 6     
 weeks except for the Planning         
 Committee which meets fortnightly.    
 There are 6 main committees: Policy   
 and Resources, Planning, Housing,     
 Tourism and Leisure, Transportation,  
 and Environmental Health. There are   
 several sub-committees and working    
 groups within each main committee.
