		<content> MUSHROOM FARMING (continued from pg 8)
 Mr. Nutting sells his mushrooms in a  
 30 mile radius of his farm, most going
 to shops in Gloucester City. He uses  
 an old Walls Ice Cream van for        
 transporting them. The price of       
 mushrooms varies according to the     
 season but the selling price in the   
 shops is generally about Â£1.25 per    
 pound.                                
 Mr. Nutting employs 24 workers. They  
 travel to work by bike, motor-bike and
 car. They work about 50 hours per week
 doing the routine jobs. Mr. Nutting   
 decides what needs doing. He grows    
 about 200,000 Kg of mushrooms a year  
 but a lot is lost due to mice. The    
 only other real pest is the mushroom  
 fly which is controlled with          
 pesticides.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
