		<content> Gunton Park is situated in North      
Norfolk six miles from the popular sea-
side town of Cromer. Once part of the  
thriving estate ,seat of the Harbords, 
Lord Suffield.The large park,now under 
cultivation,with its two lakes and     
impressive gateways is surrounded by   
mixed woodland and good quality        
farmland. Farms and cottages are       
scattered,and several miles from       
schools,hospitals, churches and        
shopping centres.Gunton Estate,in its  
heyday,was a popular Royal holiday     
haunt.However,at the end of the 19th   
century due to massive over-spending   
and extravagant entertaining a rapid   
decline set in.The Hall, park and      
Estate farms were sold in 1980. The    
owner of the Hall and Park has since   
restored them to there original        
style.They now lie within a            
conservation area of great beauty.     </content>
