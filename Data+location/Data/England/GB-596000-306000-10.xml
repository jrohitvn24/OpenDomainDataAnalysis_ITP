 computer,gardening,drama, library,    
 stamps. The smaller numbers of        
 children in clubs compared to class   
 sizes (average 32) enables difficult  
 instruments to be taught. Teachers    
 run the clubs voluntarily at lunchtime
 or after school. The football pitch   
 can be floodlit. The computer club was
 started this year. Many village clubs 
 use the school hall e.g.Karate, Youth 
 Club, Guides and Brownies. Many of the
 skills learned in the music/drama     
 clubs are utilised in school plays,   
 performances and assemblies. It has   
 become a tradition to have a school   
 production once a year which involves 
 many of the chidren in drama,music and
 backstage work. All the staff help.   </content>
