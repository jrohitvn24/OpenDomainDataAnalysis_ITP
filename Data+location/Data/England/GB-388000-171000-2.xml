 Pamphlets from the D.H.S.S help people
 to find what help they can get when   
 they are in need.We asked if we could 
 talk to someone who could tell us how 
 the D.H.S.S works and they sent two   
 people to our school.One person works 
 in the Supplementary Benefits         
 department which arranges extra money 
 for necessities.In 1948 a National    
 Insurance scheme was started.Regular  
 sums of money are deducted from       
 everyone's wages toward paying for the
 scheme.
