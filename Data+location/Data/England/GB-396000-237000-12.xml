		<title>12BREDON SPRINGS, ASHTON</title>
		<content>   This consists of two eighteenth     
 century stone cottages with some red  
 brick, ninteenth century additions.   
 They were made into one residence by  
 the present owner in 1955 with little 
 alteration to the original structure. 
   Today{Bredon Springs}is chiefly     
 notable for it's garden which has been
 open to the public since 1969. It has 
 a large collection of hardy plants in 
 informally planted areas between and  
 among trees and shrubs. The aim has   
 been to create natural plant groupings
 and indeed, many plants are self sown 
 seedlings left where they have fallen.
   As important as the plants, is the  
 wildlife. Twentysix species of birds  
 have nested there in recent years.    
 Moles, rabbits and field mice are     
 tolerated and no insecticides are used
 An old style cottage garden has been  
 created using modern ideas on ecology.</content>
