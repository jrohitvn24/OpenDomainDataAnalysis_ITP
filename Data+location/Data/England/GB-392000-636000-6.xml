		<title>06A DAY IN A FORESTERS LIFE</title>
		<content> The forestry manager has got eleven   
 men working for him and he gets some  
 of his men to plant trees.His men     
 plant about half an acre a month.He   
 and his men chop down about 1000 trees
 in a month.The tallest tree he has    
 grown is called a wellingtonia.It is  
 100ft. tall.It takes 60 years for a   
 tree to grow.The trees he grows mostly
 are pine trees.He gets the trees from 
 a nursery,sometimes from Kelso which  
 is local but sometimes he sends away  
 as far as Inverness.Trees rot because 
 disease gets in the stumps of the     
 trees and through the roots.He chops  
 four hundred christmas trees down for 
 people in Ford Etal and Crookham each 
 year.
