		<title>15NEW LONGTON ACTION GROUP</title>
		<content>{   New Longton Action Group}was formed
 to oppose the siting of Longton Riding
 Club in New Longton. The Club had to  
 move out of premises at the Victory   
 Memorial Playing Fields in Longton and
 hoped to find another site at New     
 Longton, but the Action Group opposed 
  the planning application. The        
 Riding Club now meets at Hoole.       
    The Action Group is now aiming to  
 force a split from the Longton Parish 
 Council in a campaign for independence
 to the Local Government Boundaries    
 Commission which will be asked to     
 review the electoral ward boundaries  
 in the hope that{New Longton Council  
 will be formed. Voters are now being  
 asked to sign a petition for a        
 separate council which would control  
 New Longton's rates income. Opponents 
 say that increased wages and admin.   
 costs would outweigh the benefits.    </content>
