  the people of Pelsall we found that  
   there was an even split three ways. 
          Most people said they spent  
   some time on recreation activities. 
  The amount of time varied between    
  "a lot "and"not very much "A few     
  people admitted, probably those who  
 are retired,that they had a lot of    
 time to spend on leisure,while there  
 were one or two who claimed they had  
 no time at all for recreation.
