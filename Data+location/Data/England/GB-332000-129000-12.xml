		<title>12Shopping</title>
		<content> Although most villages  have a small  
 general shop and post office people   
 have to travel to other towns for     
 their main shopping. The main towns   
  are Taunton, Street and Langport.    
 There are not many  shops at          
 Burrowbridge that is why most people  
 go to the larger towns. Taunton is the
 County Town of Somerset. Langport and 
 Street are not as big as Taunton.     
 Street is famous for shoes and sheeps-
 kin. Taunton is the best town to go to
 because it has many more shops of     
 different sorts. On the outskirts of  
 Taunton there is a huge Asda          
 supermarket. It sells all kinds of    
 food, clothes, china, garden          
 furniture, electrical goods, magazines
 and stationery. It has its own free   
 car park. People like this because it 
 is difficult to park in the town.
