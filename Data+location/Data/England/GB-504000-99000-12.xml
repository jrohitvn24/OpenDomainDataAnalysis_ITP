		<content>{The American Airfield-Rustington      
{ }Mary Taylor, the authoress, told us 
 that an airfield was built in Rust-   
 ington in 1918. It covered 159 acres  
 where Preston Avenue is now. The First
 World War ended before it was built.  
   Mrs. Taylor wrote to the American   
 Embassy for information. The Pentagon 
 sent a microfilm of all the relevant  
 documents, including details of how to
 build the Handley Page 0/400 Paralyser
 the bomber which would have flown from
 the airfield.                         
   A railway led into the airfield but 
 it was not removed properly and       
 remains are still being dug up. The   
 guard-house and salvage shed remain,  
 changed into houses. Two hangers were 
 removed to Littlehampton and are still
 used as boat sheds.
