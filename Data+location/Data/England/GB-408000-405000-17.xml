		<title>17Tourism - Popular walks.</title>
		<content> In recent years the local Water       
 Authority has opened-up the areas     
 around reservoirs to walkers and other
 visitors. Car parks have been provided
 in a number of places but as yet no   
 water sports are allowed.             
  One particular popular walk is around
 Digley and Bilberry Reservoirs. The   
 car park here is situated in an old   
 quarry. Picinc tables and litter bins 
 have been provided and a very good    
 path around the reservoirs has been   
 improved in places.                   
  A comparativley new problem of       
 concern to the local police is the    
 number of thefts from parked cars.    
 This has increased in recent times as 
 the number of visitors to this area   
 has increased. The car park at Digley 
 has been a particular focus for such  
 thefts and the police have been       
 watching this parking area closely.   </content>
