		<title>19A DAY IN MY LIFE PART 3</title>
		<content> Later my Mum comes to pick me up. We  
 get home and I watch a bit of         
 television. I then unpack my bag, wash
 out my lunchbox and pack my bag for   
 the next day. After this I play a game
 of Draughts, Chess or Football. We    
 play until dinner which is usually a  
 cooked meal. After dinner I do my     
 piano and violin practice for 15      
 minutes each and if I am in a good    
 mood I will do my guitar and recorder 
 practice. After watching a bit of     
 television I have a bath, get into my 
 pyjamas, clean my teeth, get out the  
 annual I started, get into bed, finish
 the annual, set the alarm clock for   
 the next morning, draw the curtains,  
 turn off the light, get into bed and  
 go to sleep.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
