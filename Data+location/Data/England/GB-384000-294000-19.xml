area but we do have some sports.       
                                       
     The old railway line was laid     
about 60 years ago and ran from Himley 
through Blakely,Giggetty,Wombourne,    
and Lower Penn to Wolverhampton. It    
was dismantled 20 years ago.It is now  
used for cycling, horse riding, and    
walking.The Wombourne station is now   
used as a tourist office.              
    Pool Hall pool in Lower Penn is an 
11 acre area of water used in the 18th 
as an overflow  century as an overflow 
for the Staffs &amp; Worcs canal. It is    
now used for commercial angling. There 
is a smaller pool to the south owned   
by GKN Sankey angling club.            
    There is a hockey club near        
Wombourne.
