		<content>  There are lots of kinds of transport 
 that come to or through our area.     
 There is a train track running through
 the block but although it carries     
 passenger trains as well as goods     
 trains there has not been a station in
 the block since the 1960's. The track 
 is quite busy with a train at least   
 every 15mins.                         
  Buses are the only public transport  
 in the villages and they run every    
 hour to Lincoln until about 7.00pm.   
 The bus service is not well used and  
 about 85% of people travel to and from
 work by car or motorbike.We estimate  
 that 97% of households have a motorcar
 and many teenagers have motorbikes.   
   Due to the R.A.F. aeroplanes are    
 common in the area including the      
{ Red Arrows.}
