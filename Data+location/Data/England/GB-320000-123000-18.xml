 railway going round a children's play 
 area.The trains are powered by coal   
 and are working models of real steam  
 trains.The trains have seats like     
 benches and you can ride on them for  
 10p.There are lots of flowers and a   
 new picnic area.There's a memorial to 
 the people who died in the First and  
 Second World Wars.                    
  There is a boating pond and a        
 stream with different kinds of ducks.
