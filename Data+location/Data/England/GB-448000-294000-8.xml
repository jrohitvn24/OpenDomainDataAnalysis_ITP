		<content>  Thw most interestiung feature of our 
 survey ,was that the largest          
 industrial operator was not           
 well featured.The other most          
 striking factor was the variety of    
 occupations.However the sadest feature
 of the sample was the number of       
 unemployed adults.In our sample this  
 consisted of nearly twenty percent.The
 largest number in employment were     
 involved in the building              
 trade,carpenters,and builders.Apart   
 from this no other group was          
 particularly featured.Other           
 occupations                           
 were,butcher,carsalesman,computer     
 programer,publican,quarryman,greengroc
 er,secretaries,knitwearworkers,cleaner
 s,shopassistants,and,waterboard       
 official.This list is not             
 complete.However it does give an      
 indication of the types of employment.</content>
