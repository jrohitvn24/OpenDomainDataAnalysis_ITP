		<content>   Most of the people in our area are  
 members of the Church of England,     
 Methodists or Roman Catholics.        
   There is also a Christian Fellowship
 in Whickham.                          
   There is a Church of England school 
 in Whickham(Whickham Parochial), and  
 also a Catholic school(St.Mary's).    
   The churches in the area help to run
 a lot of activities which people of   
 all ages can take part in.For         
 instance,the Church of England runs a 
 Sunday School,a Youth Club called the 
 "Monday Mob",the Mothers'Union, and   
 also helps to run a Day Care Centre   
 for elderly people.                   
   There are very few people who follow
 other religions in our area and we do 
 not think there are any other places  
 of worship such as temples or mosques.
