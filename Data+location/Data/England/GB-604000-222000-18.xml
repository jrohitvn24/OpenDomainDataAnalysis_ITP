		<title>18OUR KESTREL</title>
		<content>   On Sunday my Dad goes to the park to
 fly the {Kestrel.}A kestrel is a bird 
 of prey. We found it on a road. A few 
 months ago my dad made a shed for the 
 kestrel.sometimes my dad can't take   
 the kestrel to the park because he has
 to go on a fire call's and he has to  
 go to the fire station and drive off  
 in the fire Engine and put fire's     
 out.While my dad is doing this my mum 
 cleans up the house I sometimes help  
 her when my brother is at the park.On 
 monday after school we sometimes go to
 the sea front  and have a walk.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
