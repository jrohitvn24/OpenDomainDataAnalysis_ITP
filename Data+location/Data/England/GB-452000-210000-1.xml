		<content>  The block is typical of much of      
 Oxfordshire. Although close to the    
 city of Oxford it presents as a rural 
 area with the land divided between ten
 farms.Two villages are within the     
 block, as is part of a third, and the 
 block is under the administration of  
 five civil parishes.                  
  The land is undulating and partially 
 wooded, rising to a steep escarpment  
 giving views over Otmoor. The block is
 bisected by the B4027 road which      
 carries heavy  traffic to the M40     
 motorway. The area is criss-crossed   
 with public footpaths. The Oxfordshire
 Way,a long distance footpath ,passes  
 through the area. The river Cherwell  
 and its tributaries, the Ray and      
 Bayswater Brook, drain the land. The  
 area seems free of electricity        
 power-lines and pylons.
