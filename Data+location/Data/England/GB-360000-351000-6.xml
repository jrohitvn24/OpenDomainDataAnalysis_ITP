		<content> because the tractor can travel faster 
 and can plough five or six furrows at 
 one time.                             
  When the harvesting came they did not
 use bales but instead they stacked the
 stooks into a pyramid shape. This     
 would be made with a lot of trouble   
 and then someone would put rope or    
 twine around the middle of it. These  
 would be put on to a cart and pulled  
 by a horse and taken back to the farm 
 for storing in a haystack or a barn.  
  Nowadays we have balers which, after 
 the turning and drying, would be used 
 to bale the hay/straw. The machine    
 would take up some hay/straw, thrash  
 it and then it would make it into a   
 square and it would be bound with     
 twine and let out of the machine again
 through an exit hole.                 
  Hay making was the main harvest in   
 those days but now we do have silaging</content>
