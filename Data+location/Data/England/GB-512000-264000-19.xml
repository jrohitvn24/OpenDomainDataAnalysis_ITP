		<content>    We have several businesses within  
 our small area at present. The Heating
 &amp; Electrical engineer's (Aylward's)   
 and Farm Engineering serve domestic   
 and industrial customers. There are   
 three small Building firms,the longest
 established being T.Smith &amp; Son, which
 has been in existence since 1867 and  
 has built many houses in the Village. 
 A Building Services &amp; Plant Hire firm 
 now operates from The Green.          
    Several people are self-employed in
 the Painting &amp; Decorating line and in 
 electrical and computer services.     
    In Perry we have a fine example of 
 cottage industry in 'Darwin Pottery'. 
 It supplies personalised, individual  
 items as well as satisfying bulk      
 orders from its customers.            
    The Anglia Water Authority employs 
 a small workforce in and around its   
 Treatment Works in East Perry.        </content>
