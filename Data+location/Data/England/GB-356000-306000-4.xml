 school with two classes and 40        
 children aged from 5 to 11 years. They
 travel to school by mini bus. The     
 other local primary school is at {    
{CRESSAGE}but transport is not provided
 for the children to go there from our 
 area.                                 
  Some children go to private schools  
 in Wellington, the {OLD HALL SCHOOL}

 pay for their children to go to these 
 schools.                              
  Children aged from 11 to 18 go to the
