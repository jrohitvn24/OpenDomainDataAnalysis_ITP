		<content>      We asked seven year olds what are
 their favourite games.Most liked{Tiggy
 or{Hide}and{Seek.}Some liked playing  
 schools because they like their       
 friends to play. The most interesting 
 game is{Foxy Foxy 123.}One person is  
 chosen to be Foxy. Foxy goes and      
 stands at the wall. The other people  
 are chickens and stand at a line. Foxy
 faces the wall and says "Foxy Foxy    
 123" to herself.If she sees anybody   
 moving they will have to go and stand 
 in a line touching the wall. If she   
 doesn't see anybody move they have to 
 try and touch the wall. When everybody
 is caught they will then just stay in 
 a line. The chickens at each end have 
 to touch hands, but if Foxy sees      
 them move they will go back to the    
 start. If they touch hands they shout 
 "Foxy" and run. If Foxy catches any,  
 that one is the new Foxy.             </content>
