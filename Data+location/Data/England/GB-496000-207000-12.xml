We also interviewed our grand-parents. 
They went to schools, a few of which   
are still open, e.g. Victoria and      
Northchurch. Many left at the age of   
14. Some lived on farms and still      
remember the pony and traps carrying   
the milk churns.                       
They said that nearly all the shops had
changed and that many of the new       
housing estates were  built on what was
once open fields.                      
The station is still the same, but the 
trains are now electric, instead of    
steam! Fashion has changed many times  
and the women remember long dresses and
all of them wore hats.                 
When they were young, they would cook  
on open grates. They had oil lamps, or 
candles, then gas lamps, then          
electricity. Entertainment was found   
through listening to early radios.     </content>
