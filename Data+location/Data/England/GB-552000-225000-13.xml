		<content>      Elsenham village has existed     
 since Saxon times.  For most of that  
 time most of the people worked the    
 land.  Earlier this century it was    
 still possible to see flocks of sheep 
 or herds of cattle being driven       
 through the main streets to market in,
 for example, nearby Dunmow, or to the 
 local railway station.  Elsenham      
 never had its own market.             
      Over the years there have been   
 many boundary changes.  What is now   
 Fullers End, an area of wealthy       
 residents, was once the centre of     
 Elsenham, and what now is the centre  
 of Elsenham was once Henham.          
      What really caused the expansion 
 of Elsenham was the building of the   
 M11 which allowed easy access to      
 Cambridge and, in particular, London. 
 Since the mid 70's when Elsenham was  
 connected to mainline sewage over 500 </content>
