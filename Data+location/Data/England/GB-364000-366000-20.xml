		<content>    Bostock is a small village of 250  
 people, situated on the A533 Northwich
 to Middlewich road.                   
    There are facilities for tennis and
 bowls and a social club. There are no 
 shops and the children have to travel 
 to Davenham or Middlewich to attend   
 school.                               
    The surrounding countryside is used
 as grazing land. In the fields are    
 many clumps of trees which are used as
 breeding grounds for Pheasants. One of
 the old trees in the village is said  
 to mark the centre of the county of   
 Cheshire.                             
    Winsford salt mines spread under   
 Bostock and explosions can be heard at
 the same time every day.              
    Bostock Hall is found in the       
 village. It was previously owned by   
 Colonel France Hayhurst, for whom many
 of the local people worked.           </content>
