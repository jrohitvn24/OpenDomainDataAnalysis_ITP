 brickbuilt with slate or pantile roofs
 . The proportion of bungalows is high.
 There  are  150 council dwellings plus
 Oaklands, 14  flats  for  the  elderly

 been    converted     into     private
 residential   homes.  Saxilby's  older
 houses are Victorian or Edwardian with
 a few exceptions. 76 High Street is  a
 part  16th  century timber frame house
 now restored and the  Manor  House  is
 part  16th century. An annual award is
 made for the  most  improved  property
 and  has  included  the old school and

 farmhouses lie to the west of Saxilby.
