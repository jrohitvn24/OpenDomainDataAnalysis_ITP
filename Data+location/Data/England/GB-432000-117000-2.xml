		<title>02TEST VALLEY LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>  This is a lowland area which only    
 rises to 62 m.The lowest land is about
 5m.It is drained by two rivers;the    
 river Test and its tributary the river
 Blackwater.The river Test flows south_
 wards across its floodplain;flat land 
 which is liable to flood in winter.   
 Some land is marshy and has been      
 drained by ditches.The river          
 Blackwater is smaller and meanders    
 through a narrow and steeper sided    
 valley.                               
  The areas away from the river valley 
 are gently sloping except for a ridge 
 of highland which can be seen         
 approaching the area from the south.  
 This has steep slopes and separates   
 the two rivers.There are several small
 lakes in the area found mainly in the 
 wooded areas,the largest of which is  
 Kentford Lake.
