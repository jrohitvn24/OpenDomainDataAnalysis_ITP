		<title>16THE RAIL TRAIL</title>
		<content> The Rail Trail starts at Greenfield   
 village and continues to Etherley,    
 where it crosses the main street and  
 on to Phoenix Row where the original  
 line ends.  The line was part of the  
 Stockton and Darlington Railway built 
 in 1825 but superseded in 1843 by the 
 line through Shildon Tunnel to Bishop 
 Auckland and Witton Park, Engineered  
 by George Stephenson.                 
    Now you can walk from Greenfield   
 village East along the footpath to    
 Etherley.  Little remains of the line 
 except the rubble from the demolished 
 Engine house and some stone slabs with
 the holes that retained the sleepers. 
 Beyond Etherley incline the the bridge
 over the main road has been demolished
 and the line continues to Phoenix row,
 the site of the original Colliery.    
 Here the line ended with the view of  
 Witton Park ahead in the distance.    </content>
