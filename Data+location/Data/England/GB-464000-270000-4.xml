		<title>04Bird watching,Ravensthorpe</title>
		<content> Ravensthorpe reservoir has one of the 
best areas in Northamptonshire for bird
watching,being in the top 3 with 150   
regular species.The sanctuary is       
unusual in that it is owned and run by 
the Anglia Water Authority.Some of the 
native ducks are the tufted shoveler,  
teal,golden eye and great crested grebe
One duck that overwinters,the long     
tail,is usually a sea bird.There are   
several ferral colonies the largest of 
which are the Canada Geese.They eat a  
lot of corn from neighbouring fields.  
Occasional migrating birds such as the 
arctic tern get blown off course and   
stay but our most prestigious visitor  
is the osprey.However the real value of
the area is in it being a constant home
to so many ordinary birds.Entry is pro-
hibited but many keen birdwatchers     
enjoy studying with binoculars such a  
variety of birds in a peaceful setting.</content>
