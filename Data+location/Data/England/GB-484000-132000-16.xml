		<content>  There are church registers that date 
 from 1560, and are now held at the    
 County Archives,{Winchester.}         
  From those interviewed more than a   
 quarter are commuters who travel to   
 London by car and train. Many         
 preferred shopping in bulk at a       
 supermarket which is hardly surprising
 since the village has no shops. Apart 
 from a post box opposite the church   
 and a bus stop and phone box situated 
 on the A3 just outside the village,   
 there are no services in{Bramshott.}  
  Travelling by car is necessary in    
 order to obtain goods and services.   
 For electrical goods people go to     
{Guildford.}The cinema is unpopular and
 so are the West End theatres. People  
 spend their holidays either in        
 Britain or on the continent.
