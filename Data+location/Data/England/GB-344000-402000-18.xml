		<content>The block has been divided since       
boundary changes on the introduction of
the new Metropolitan Boroughs.         
   The whole block was initially under 
the control of Lancashire County       
Council. However since the boundary    
changes the main areas of Rainford     
Junction and Barrow Nook have been     
enclosed in the Merseyside County      
Council boundaries. These areas are    
also served by St. Helens Borough      
Council who provide them with a variety
of services.                           
   Bickerstaffe still remains inside   
the Lancashire County Council boundary.
    The residents who have been moved  
from Lancashire into Merseyside do not 
appear to welcome the move. This may in
part be due to sharp rate increases in 
the Merseyside area.
