		<title>20ANIMALS IN KETTLEWELL</title>
		<content>   Rabbits are the most numerous       
 species in Kettlewell, with           
 myxamatosis sadly showing a return    
 after some years of dormancy.  On     
 Knipe End there are some black        
 rabbits.  There are hares and moles,  
 with foxes sometimes seen in daylight.
   Rats occur frequently near          
 agricultural holdings.  The wood and  
 field mouse, bank vole, common and    
 pygmy shrew are found, together with  
 hedgehogs and grey squirrels.  Deer   
 used to be common:  however, roe deer 
 are more plentiful than is generally  
 realised.  Occasionally badger sets   
 are found.                            
 The main predators, apart from foxes, 
 are stoats and weasels.  Mink are     
 becoming common and are causing havoc 
 with breeding moorhens by the         
 riverbank, and they have made water   
 voles scarcer.                        </content>
