		<title>02Landscape of Charnwood</title>
		<content> In the interior of Charnwood Forest   
 and famous for its geology,natural    
 beauty and fine views this area is 600
 to 800ft above sea level and forms the
 watershed between the tributaries of  
 the R.Soar.It is a volcanic landscape 
 of pre Cambrian rocks rising craggily 
 out of smooth marly valleys.The       
 highest point is Beacon Hill 248m once
 an Iron Age hill fort the banks and   
 ditches of its fortifications still   
 visible under the bracken and the     
 lower slopes covered by birches and   
 rhodedendrons.Further W Copt Oak at   
 236m is another commanding point.     
 Between these the Ulverscroft valley  
 runs southward where the ruins of     
 Ulverscroft Priory lie hidden close to
 the only large pool in the area.The   
 thin stony soils are cultivated almost
 to the hilltops with considerable     
 grass land on the upper slopes.       </content>
