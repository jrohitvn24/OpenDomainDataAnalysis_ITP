		<title>03FARMING IN BRADWELL</title>
		<content>   The main crop grown at{Eastles farm 
 is wheat. The other crops on the farm 
 are potatoes, rape, linseed, peas and 
 barley.                               
   As we went around we counted all the
 machines. There were 32 altogether.   
 These included tractors, trailers, a  
 combine harvester and a potato sorter.
   Two extra men are employed in the   
 winter to sort and bag up the         
 potatoes.The potatoes are sold        
 locally. Last year they grew 1000     
 tonnes. The potatoes are stored in the
 barn. In the barn is a special machine
 which emits a high frequency sound to 
 frighten the mice away.               
  They also have cows on the farm      
 during the winter.There were 27 last  
 year.The cows have to be fattened up  
 for market. They eat potatoes and hay.
