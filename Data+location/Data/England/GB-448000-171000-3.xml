		<title>03SCHOOL OF MILITARY SURVEY</title>
		<content> Two men from the School of Militaru   
 Survey came to visit us in school and 
 showed us some of their map making    
 equipment and slides. We were very    
 interested, especially as some of our 
 dads work there. They told us that the
 building was an American military     
 hospital in World War 2 and the School
 moved to Hermitage in 1949. Their job 
 is to make maps for the RAF, the Army 
 and the Navy, and also people come    
 from all over the world to learn about
 map making. First the field surveyors 
 go out and use trig points to mark    
 where they are, and they use planes   
 equipped with cameras to show what the
 whole world looks like. The           
 cartographers draw neat maps, or      
 automated cartographers are used, and 
 the information is plotted onto a     
 computer disc. Finally lots of maps   
 are printed off.                      </content>
