		<content>LOCAL EVENTS                           
 There are a number of traditional     
events in Sandhurst, many of which are 
connected with the Church or the Womens
Institute but none are nationally well 
known.                                 
 In summer an annual Fete is held in   
the Village Hall and in December there 
is a Christmas Fair. Each June a day   
out is organised by the Womens Instit- 
ute for all the elderly residents of   
the village. When they return a special
meal is arranged for them in the Hall. 
At Christmas a big dinner is provided, 
with all the traditional  trimmings.   
 Other annual events include a Harvest 
Supper and a Flower Festival which is  
held in the Church. The River Severn   
near Sandhurst is a traditional elver  
fishing site for locals in spring and  
in summer the Gloucester Regatta is    
held there.                            </content>
