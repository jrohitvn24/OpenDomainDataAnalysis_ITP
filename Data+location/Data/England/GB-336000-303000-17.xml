		<title>17MINSTERLEY EISTEDDFOD</title>
		<content>      Every year in{March}there is an  
 Eisteddfod held in the{Parish Hall.It 
 goes on from morning until late at    
 night. There are{choirs, solo singers,
{recitations, poetry &amp; short story     
 competitions.Instrumentalists play    
{harps, violins, piano, flute &amp; 'cello.
      In the morning the children      
 perform. The Rev. Howell introduces   
 us.There are individuals &amp; school     
{choirs,}including the choir from      
 Minsterley School. The six judges sit 
 in the middle of the audience at a    
 long table.There is one judge for each
 competition.It is frightening to stand
 on the stage &amp; face all the people    
 watching.The Judges afterwards read   
 all the marks of the competitors &amp; say
 what was good &amp; what was bad about    
 each performance.Adults perform later.
 The winners get{cups &amp; rosettes.
