		<content>{ St.Basil's school}was built sixteen  
 years ago,at about the same time as   
 the{Upton Estate}to accomodate        
 families from sub_standard dwellings  
 in both{Widnes}and{Liverpool.         
  There are 160 children in the school 
 and no longer are the different       
 backgrounds of the children  obvious  
 -no "Scouse"accents as there were when
 the school was in its infancy.The     
 community is stable and most families 
 envisage staying permanently in Upton.
 Some of the children,are brought by   
 bus from other areas of Widnes.       
  Many fathers are unemployed or low   
 paid but the children are well dressed
 in their grey and blue uniforms.At    
 eleven most children continue there   
 education at either{SS Fisher More    
{High School}or{St.Joseph's High School
 in{Widnes}although some go to fee     
 paying schools in{Liverpool.          </content>
