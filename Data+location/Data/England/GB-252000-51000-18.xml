		<title>18St. Marys Church Brixton</title>
		<content> In 1086 the Christian worship of      
 Brixton was conducted by monks from   
 Plympton Abbey. The people probably   
 worshipped around the village cross.  
 After 1121 there was probably a small 
 chapel on the site of the present     
 church. Our present church was        
 dedicated in 1477. It is perpendicular
 in style. It has a nave, two aisles,  
 chancel and sanctuary. The tower is   
 18 metres high and has six bells.     
 There are many stained glass windows  
 in the church depicting biblical      
 scenes. There is a fine wood carved   
 pulpit and limestone font. There has  
 been 30 vicars since 1181. The present
 vicar is the Revd. Dennis Maddocks. He
 may be the last vicar of Brixton      
 because the parish may become  a team 
 ministry with Yealmpton.
