		<title>18Nature Reserve, Hadstock</title>
		<content> A small plot of land, about 1 hectare 
 in area, on the edge of the old Liitle
 Walden airfield, is managed as the    
 Harrison Sayer nature reserve.  (It is
 named after the former owner of the   
 land.)                                
    The reserve includes an abandoned  
 stretch of the old road from Little   
 Walden to Hadstock, and the founda-   
 tions of airfield buildings, as well  
 as more natural clay and chalk soil.  
    It has a colony of bee orchids,    
 though these don't grow in such       
 numbers as they once did; hairy-leaved
 rose and wild liquorice also flourish.
    A vixen and her cubs usually have  
 an earth there, and there are plenty  
 of rabbits.  Forty different kinds of 
 beetle were counted recently.         
    One of the wardens' jobs is to try 
 to stop the blackthorn from growing   
 over too much of the reserve.         </content>
