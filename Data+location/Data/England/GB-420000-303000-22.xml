<title>22Transport in Tamworth</title>
<content>

Tansport in Tamworth is mainly cars now. With Ventura Shopping area very inaccessable by foot and traffic a serious problem. Buses run on a regular basis taking people all over the town and even further a field. The bus station is sitated in Aldegate but busses can be caught mainly in Corporation Street and Victoria road. The town is also served by two main train lines which cross at the station know as Tamworth Junction, this makes most of the country easily accessable by train. Road links such as Watling street (A5) and the M42 also mean tamworth is prime location for commuters to local cities. The town centre is completly pedestrianised but most of the town is served by cycle paths.   &lt;br />
