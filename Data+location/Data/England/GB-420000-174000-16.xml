		<content>       Saturday 1st June               
 Wake up 7.28am get dressed, go down-  
 stairs to make breakfast.After break- 
 fast I ring up Sarah to see if she    
 would                                 
  like to come to play and the         
 decision is made to go swimming in    
 five minutes time.I brush my hair     
 and clean my teeth.                   
 "Ring ring".There goes the door bell. 
 "They're here mummy! Bye."            
 I go down the drive and find Sarah's  
 car waiting for me.We get to          
 Marlborough swimming pool and we have 
 a race to see who would get ready     
 first,I win.                          
 We stay in the pool for about an      
 hour. We get dressed and go out into  
 the lobby to get our sweets.          
 We take the bus home to Ogbourne St   
 George.                               
                                       </content>
