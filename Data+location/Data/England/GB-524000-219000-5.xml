		<content> The Knebworth Variety club is a       
 charity which raises money for people 
 in need. They perform an Old Time     
 Music Hall variety show twice a year. 
 The club consists of local people who 
 enjoy acting. Rehearsals begin about  
 two months before each performance and
 take place on Tuesday and Thursday    
 evenings. The show is performed each  
 evening for one week in the Village   
 Hall. The audience sit at candle-lit  
 tables and waitresses serve drinks and
 a simple ploughman's lunch during the 
 performance.
