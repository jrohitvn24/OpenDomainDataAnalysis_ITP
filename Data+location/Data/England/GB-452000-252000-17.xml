		<title>17 Station Court.</title>
		<content> Station Court is situated by the      
approach road to the old Woodford Halse
station.It has been open for 5 years   
and was built for old age pensioners.  
There are 24 flats with 1 person in and
and 6 with couples.There have been 2   
bad fires there and both were caused by
cookers in the flats.There are 2 lifts 
for people who have difficulty in      
walking and want to go upstairs.The    
people upstairs often entertain the    
ones downstairs and make them laugh.The
Warden,Mrs.Kirk, has to go around all  
the flats seeing if anybody wants      
anything from the shops like chocolate,
sweets,cigarettes etc.In each corridor 
there is a firedoor made with special  
glass which will trap the fire in one  
corridor and stop it spreading.It is   
part of Mrs Kirk's duties to make sure 
that the residents are healthy and if  
not she must call the medical services.</content>
