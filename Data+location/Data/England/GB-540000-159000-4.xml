		<content> BIGGIN HILL AIR FAIR                  
                                       
       The Air Fair was started in 1962
 and held in each year at a weekend in 
 May.  It is an important recreational 
 event and attracts many thousands of  
 visitors to Biggin Hill with special  
 buses running from Bromley South.  In 
 Biggin Hill the roads get very crowded
 and there is a lot of noise from all  
 the jets.  Surrey Aviation, the       
 company running the airport for       
 Bromley Council, started the Air Fair 
 to stimulate intererst in aeroplanes. 
 There is lots of flying with both     
 historic aircraft (e.g. Hurricane,    
 Spitfire, Lancaster) and modern       
 aircraft (e.g. the Red Arrows).       
       Also, there are many exhibitions
 and displays, and a big fun fair with 
 rides like the American Egg.
