 in 1974. There arefive brood mares and
 three of them have foals this summer. 
 The Stud is run and managed entirely  
 by the owner. The nine acres of land  
 upon which the mares run is           
 beautifully maintained and all the    
 fencing is post and rail.             
 The foundation mare of the Stud -     
 False Evidence is 22 years old and is 
 still producing good foals. Her fourth
 generation, Dreyfus won at Warwick in 
 July 1985.                            
 Another of her offspring, Cry of      
 Truth, was top 2 year old filly in    
 1974. She is now 13 years old and a   
 brood mare at the Stud.               
 The foals are weaned at Denton and are
 sold as yearlings.
