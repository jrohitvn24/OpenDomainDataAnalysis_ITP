		<title>09Employment in Sheerness</title>
		<content>     A feature of the{employment       
 situation in Sheerness is that one in 
 five adults is now out of{work.}More  
 men than women are unemployed at the  
 present time. The figures vary        
 seasonally because there are more jobs
 available during the summer months    
 when there is an increase in the      
{population}because of the influx of   
 summer visitors.                      
     A local firm have declared their  
 intention to sponsor ten unemployed in
 response to{government}requests which 
 could lead to permanent employment.   
 This opportunity will be for people   
 over eighteen who have been unemployed
 for twelve months out of the last     
 fifteen.                              
     Many young people leaving school  
 will be compelled to go on the dole.
