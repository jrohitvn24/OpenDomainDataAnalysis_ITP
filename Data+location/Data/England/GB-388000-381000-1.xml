		<content>  Our square is situated 12 miles south
 of Manchester on the edge of the      
 Cheshire green belt.The area takes in 
 the southern edge of the village of   
 Bramhall and the village of Woodford. 
 Both these villages have grown due to 
 Manchester commuters moving into the  
 area.New housing estates of mainly    
 detatched houses have been built to   
 accomodate these people.              
  The area is predominantly rural.     
 However the major influence regarding 
 employment is British Aerospace.      
 British Aerospace covers a very large 
 area,including runways,and yet manages
 to remain unobtrusive upon the        
 landscape.                            
 It is a fairly affluent area where    
 entertainment is on a community basis 
 with further activities available in  
 Manchester and Stockport.
