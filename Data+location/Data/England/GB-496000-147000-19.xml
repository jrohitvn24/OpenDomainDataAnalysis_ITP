		<title>19S.W.GUILDFORD: ENTERTAINMENT</title>
		<content>   The Civic Hall is a major centre for
 entertainment in Guildford. It hosts a
 variety of events including live      
 concerts and discos, these appeal     
 especially to the young. The Guildford
 Philharmonic Orchestra also uses the  
 Civic Hall for regular concerts.      
   There are two theatres in Guildford,
 the Bellerby and the Yvonne Arnaud.   
 The Bellerby produces amateur plays,  
 and drama and dance activities,       
 whereas the Yvonne Arnaud produces    
 amateur and professional performances 
 which sometimes feature well-known    
 personalities.                        
   Guildford has two cinemas, The Odeon
 and Studio One And Two.               
   A bingo hall is situated just       
 outside the town centre and is very   
 popular, as is Cinderella Rockafellas
