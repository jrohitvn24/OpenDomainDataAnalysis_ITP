		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF THE AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
There were many different aspects in   
our area of study. The area included a 
mining element as two collieries,      
Florence and Hem Heath were in our     
patch. Other industry in our area      
included the Wedgwood factory at       
Barlaston and a trading estate with    
many different industries at Newstead. 
                                       
We also chose to look at the religious 
life of the area  and the institutions 
concerned with health and welfare of   
members of the community. We looked at 
education in the area by looking at    
Blurton High School.                   
                                       
Finally there was also a farming       
component in our area involving        
Cocknage farm and Crowcroft poultry    
farm.
