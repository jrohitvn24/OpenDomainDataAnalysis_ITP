      The Tea Time Club is on a Monday,
 Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  It  
 starts at 3.3O and finishes at 5.OO.  
 On a Monday, Tuesday and Thursday we  
 play games like tennis and twister.   
 The girls knit or play in the Wendy   
 house.  The boys play football        
 outside.  There is a shop where we can
 buy sweets and crisps.                
      On a Wednesday a Disco is on.  At
 the Disco we dance.  We can choose our
 favourite  records.  There is a       
 competition.  We stand at the back and
 tell the lady what the song is.  We   
 also have a competition for the best  
 dancer.                               
       The Tea Time Club is held in    
 Choppington Community Centre.
