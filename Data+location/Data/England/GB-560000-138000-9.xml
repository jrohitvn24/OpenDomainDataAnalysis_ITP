		<content>{Transport, Traffic Survey, Pembury.}  
 A questionnaire was carried out in    
 Pembury to observe the residents      
 opinion on the roads. The results     
 showed that people believed there was 
 a traffic problem, as the main roads  
 were in continuous use, mainly cars   
 but also heavy lorries.               
 Many of the motorists questioned      
 passed through daily or twice a week, 
 on most occasions, travelling to or   
 from Tunbridge Wells.                 
 People were asked if they thought the 
 bypass was necessary and worth the    
 cost of over Â£10 million.The majority 
 (over 75%) stated it was. When asked  
 if they thought the new roads would   
 increase the number of people shopping
 in Pembury, they said it would not.   
 People using the bypass would be less 
 likely to stop.
