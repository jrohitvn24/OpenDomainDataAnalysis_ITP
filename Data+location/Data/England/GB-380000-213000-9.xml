		<content>  Until the dual carriageway road was  
 built in 1979 to link Gloucester with 
 the M5 motorway, Bristol Road was part
 of the A38, nicknamed "the longest    
 lane in England". Large areas of the  
 land were owned by the R.A.F. A vast  
 building programme in the last 10     
 years has linked Quedgeley with Hard- 
 wicke and Tuffley.

  Building of factories and warehouses 
 south of the Cole Avenue roundabout   
 has just started. Tesco's new store   
 (1984) and free bus service caused    
 misgivings to some Gloucester traders.
  It is likely that Quedgeley will soon
 become part of Gloucester.            </content>
