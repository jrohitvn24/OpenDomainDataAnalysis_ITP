		<title>02Hatfield Broad Oak Village</title>
		<content>   Situated some 27 miles from London  
 and 5 miles from Bishop's Stortford,  
 the nearest market town, Hatfield     
 Broad Oak is today a quiet village    
 showing few signs of its former       
 importance.  In the middle ages the   
 church formed part of a Benedictine   
 Priory and the village was a          
 well-known centre.  Today most of its 
 inhabitants go out of the village to  
 work, some travelling as far as London
 each day.                             
   In the central and most ancient part
 of the village near the church all of 
 the houses are over one hundred years 
 old and many date back to Tudor times 
 or even earlier. There is also much   
 more recent housing, some of it       
 decidedly less picturesque than the   
 ancient cottages in the High Street   
 and Cage End.
