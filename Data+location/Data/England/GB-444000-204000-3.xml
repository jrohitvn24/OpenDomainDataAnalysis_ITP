		<title>03Landscape: The Long Leys</title>
		<content> The Long Leys is a lane, eventually   
 becoming a green road, leading from   
 the centre of Cumnor village to the   
 old ferry at Bablockhythe. It is now  
 much overgrown and muddy in bad       
 weather. Just off the path, hidden by 
 trees and overgrown grass, is the     
 Physic Well. It now looks like a small
 pond of cloudy water, though the walls
 of the well are visible. Nothing seems
 to be known of its history though it  
 has the reputation of being good for  
 eye troubles. (cp. St. Margaret's Well
 at Binsey not far away.)
