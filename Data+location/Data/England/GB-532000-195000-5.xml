 only with London, but also with towns 
 like Cambridge &amp; Hertford. Little Park
 Gardens bus terminus is busy &amp; impor- 
 tant, serving the following buses:29, 
 W2,217b,310,316,360,191 &amp;231. Enfield 
 Town railway station was built in 1849
 to join with the Eastern Counties line
 at Edmonton. The station was origin-  
 ally a school. This was demolished in 
 1872 and a new station built. The line
 runs from Enfield Town to Liverpool   
 St.. In peak hours 4/5 trains leave   
 Enfield Town every hour. Enfield Chase
 station opened in April 1871, part of 
 the Great Northern Railway. It was a  
 terminus - in 1910 the line was       
 extended to Cuffley &amp; a new station   
 built lower down Windmill Hill. Now   
 the line runs from Hertford North into
 Moorgate, with up to 6 trains an hour.</content>
