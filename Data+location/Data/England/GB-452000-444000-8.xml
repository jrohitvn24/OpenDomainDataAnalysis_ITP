		<content> There have been more houses built in  
 the last 30 years than in the previous
 3 centuries.The oldest house is The   
 Old Manor House built in 1670.This was
 partly destroyed by fire, and the new 
 Manor was erected nearer to the       
 church.This building is now for sale. 
 Planning permission has been granted  
 for a number of uses eg.as a hotel,a  
 nursing home,a school or a multiple   
 residence.New houses are being built  
 nearby.

 variety of styles.There are 4 council 
 bungalows and 2 council houses.The
