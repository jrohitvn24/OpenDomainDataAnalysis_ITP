		<content>         IT IS QUITE INTERESTING TO    
SEE HOW A 71 YEAR OLD LADY HAS AN      
ORDINARY DAY. I INTERVIEWED A LADY AND 
THIS IS HOW IT WENT...                 
"I GET UP AT 9.30AM AND HAVE MY        
BREAKFAST OF KELLOGGÂ£S CORNFLAKES AND  
 THEN GET DRESSED AND GO OUT SHOPPING, 
COMEBACK AND DO SOME HOUSEWORK AND HAVE
MY LUNCH (WHICH IS A VERIETY OF THINGS)
AFTER LUNCH I WATCH TELEVISION OR      
MAYBE GO OUT SOMEWERE.I COME HOME AND  
MAKE MY TEA,WHICH IS AGAIN A VERIETY   
OF THINGS. I WATCH SOME MORE TELEVISION
AND GO TO BED ABOUT HALF PAST NINE."   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
