		<content> The centre was opened 1976. In the    
 main gym all kinds of ball games,     
 parties, shows, discos and roller     
 skating take place. In the small gym  
 we can play table tennis, trampoline  
 acrobatics,do weight training or      
 practise mountaineering on the        
 climbing wall. There are 4 squash     
 courts which are always in            
 use. Keepfit clubs and saunas are very
 popular. The large swimming pool is   
 used for school swimming lessons and  
 is open to the public outside school  
 hours. A cafe and bar are open for    
 refreshment. Many facilities are free 
 to the unemployed and anyone can have 
 a lot of fun at little cost. We are   
 proud of our centre.
