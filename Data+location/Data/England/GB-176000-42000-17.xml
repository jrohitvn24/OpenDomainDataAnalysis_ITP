 crops and has grassland. We went to{  
{Westleigh Farm}where they grow all    
 sorts of flowers. They also grow      
 Strawberry plants etc. They sell them 
 to people across the road, that is a  
 Garden Centre. In our area there are a
 lot of grassland farms. You can get   
 all sorts of grassland. For instance  
 there is{Rough Grazing}land. It also  
 means crops. There are many different 
 sorts. There are{Barley meal, Barley, 
{Mixed poultry corn and Cut maize}and  
 many other sorts. Barley wheat is the 
 most important and grown cereal. The  
 husks are used for making nylon and   
 antiseptics. Rye and straw are good   
 for thatching roofs and paper making. 
 Maize is grown for{silage}and as{     
{vegetable.}
