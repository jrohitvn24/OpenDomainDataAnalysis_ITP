		<title>20OUR RIVER - THE SWALE</title>
		<content> The local river runs just on the      
 outskirts of Helperby and Brafferton. 
 It is a borderline between some farms.
 The wildlife of the river includes    
               fish and ducks, but you 
 do see mink, water rats and otters.   
 Sheltered parts of the river are      
 covered in ice in winter and the banks
 are very slippery. In summer the banks
 are covered in grasses and brambles.  
 The fishermen park their cars in the  
 Oak Tree car park,(one of the local   
 pubs).After the match they come back  
 and open the hatch. Following rain in 
 the Dales the river water is dark     
 brown and peaty. It is muddy after a  
 storm. In winter the river sometimes  
 floods the nearby fields. When there  
 is a month of hot weather the river   
 runs very clear and low and the fish  
 are very easily seen.   James Moorey.
