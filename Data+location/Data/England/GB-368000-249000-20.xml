		<content> Most people own a car or have the use 
 of one.  Motorcycles and bicycles     
 provide transport for the young and   
 fit. A private bus operator runs a bus
 on weekdays between Bromyard and      
 Worcester via Acton Green, known as   
 the workers' bus. There is a bus to   
 Worcester on Saturdays from Bishops   
 Frome. On Thursdays a bus runs from   
 Bromyard through Acton Green to       
 Ridgeway Cross. Milk, bread, fish are 
 delivered, but only once or twice a   
 week. There is a mobile shop, and     
 coal, fuel oil, gas. and firewood, are
 delivered as required. Milk is        
 collected daily from the farms by     
 tanker. Other farm produce and raw    
 materials are delivered to and from   
 farms by lorries, the ever increasing 
 size of which causes dismay to other  
 road users. As one elderly resident   
 said 'everything comes from away'.    </content>
