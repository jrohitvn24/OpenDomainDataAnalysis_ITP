		<title>09BEING A TEACHER IN TOW LAW.</title>
		<content> There is no special age to be a       
 teacher, though it is usual to go to  
 college or university after leaving   
 school at 18.                         
                                       
 To be a teacher in a primary school   
 you have to be able to teach all      
 subjects. In Tow Law J.M. &amp; I. School 
 the class teachers enjoy their work   
 very much. At the moment there are 7  
 class teachers, 1 part-time teacher   
 and the head-teacher, Mr R.C. Baker.  
                                       
 There have been many changes of staff 
 during the last 10 years or so, and   
 the curriculum has changed too. The   
 use of a computer is an example.      
                                       
 Both boys and girls are taught        
 together for most of the time.
