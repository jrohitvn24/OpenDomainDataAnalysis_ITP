		<title>11THE TOLL HOUSE</title>
		<content>   In the past the government wanted   
 the roads improving.  They wanted to  
 build new roads because the roads     
 were bumpy and not safe.  On a{toll   
{road}the people had to pay to go where
 they were going.                      
   On our map we have an old{toll      
{house.} The toll house on our map is  
 out of use today.  Someone lives in   
 the house now and the toll road is not
 private anymore.  Now you can go      
 across without paying anything.       
   It was called the{Brampton Bierlow  
{and Hooton Roberts Trust}and the toll 
 house was put up at the end of the    
 road to make sure that every traveller
 paid.  The trust also repaired        
 stretches of road and charged         
 travellers a fee for using them.      
   The toll house was still in use in  
 1854 but not today.
