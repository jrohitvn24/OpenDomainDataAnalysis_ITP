  Much of the City of London was       
 estroyed in the War, necessitating    
immense rebuilding. The Nat. West.     
International Tower is the tallest     
building in London and dwarfs St.Pauls.
The Barbican Estate, enclosing the     
Museum of London, the Arts Centre and  
numerous luxury apartments has been    
built on the site of Cripplegate and is
a popular area for Londoners and       
tourists.                              
  There is still much evidence of      
historic London. St. Dunstan's in the  
East near Idol Lane, the Bevis Marks   
Synagogue in Camomile Street and names 
such as Crutched Friars and Pepys      
Street are a few examples. There are   
also constant excavations, such as the 
current ones by the old Royal Mint off 
East Smithfield and near Portsoken     
Street, (E1).                          </content>
