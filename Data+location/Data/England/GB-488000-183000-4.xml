 effect of a village green.The main    
 changes which people would like to see
 were alternative parking facilities   
 off the High St. and the provision of 
 a local store in the old part of the  
 village for everyday needs.Sir George 
 Young felt that there was a need for  
 some public tennis courts and perhaps 
 a swimming pool and he regretted the  
 fact that the children of local people
 found it hard to stay in the area     
 because of the high cost of housing.  
   It was interesting to talk to an    
{American Doctor}and his wife who were 
 visiting the village. He had been     
 billettedat the{Odney Club}before{D   
{Day}and remembered the barrier on the 
 river road manned by the{Home Guard}to
 protect the village in the event of an
 invasion.He said the river was cleaner
 then and they swam in the May of 1944.</content>
