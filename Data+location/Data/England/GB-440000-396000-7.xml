		<title>07A day in the life of Jamie</title>
		<content>    I wake at 7.00 and have a shower.  
 Then I make a cup of tea and watch    
 'He-Man' on T.V. After a breakfast of 
 cornflakes I leave for school at 8.45.
    I wait in the yard for the bell to 
 ring, then register in my form room.  
    Lessons are 35 minutes long and a  
 typical day might be Maths, English,  
 Science, Geography, and in the after- 
 noon 2 'doubles', Woodwork and French.
    'Break' is from 10.30 _ 10.45. I go
 into the yard or to the school shop.  
 Lunchtime is from 12.00 _ 1.15 when I 
 go home and have a pizza and a cup of 
 coffee with my parents. I do my home- 
 work and leave for school at 1 p.m.   
    After school I do my homework until
 4.30 when I watch T.V. My mother gets 
 home at 6.00 and then we have tea.    
    My father and I then go to the     
 video shop to hire two cassettes which
 we watch until I go to bed at 11.40.  </content>
