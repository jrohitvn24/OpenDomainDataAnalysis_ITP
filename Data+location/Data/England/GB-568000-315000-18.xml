 The game is an exciting one and we are
 a little lucky to win by three-one. We
 all have a glass of orange and soon it
 is time to go home. I go home with my 
 friend who lives two doors away from  
 us. Wekeep our school kit on and play 
 shots and goalkeepers until about five
 thirty. When I go home for my tea my  
 Dad is already home and he asks me    
 about the game.                       
 We have pork chops for tea and then I 
 help my mum and sister to wash up.    
 After that we all watch TV. My        
 favourite programme is Top of the     
 Pops. I go to bed at about nine and   
 read my library Dandy and Beano comics
 until about nine thirty when my mum   
 comes in to switch off my light.
