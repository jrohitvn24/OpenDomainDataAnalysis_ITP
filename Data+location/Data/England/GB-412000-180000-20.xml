		<title>20Housing in Wroughton</title>
		<content>    Along the A361 itself there are a  
 number of turn of the century large   
 houses together with rows of smaller  
 terraced housing _ particularly in    
 North Wroughton and Church Hill _     
 which have been modernised with new   
 windows and frontages.                
    The post war housing is split into 
 mainly bungalows and semi_detached    
 houses. The bungalows take up whole   
 roads and are both detached and       
 semi_detached. Among the houses are   
 individual detached houses of varying 
 sizes.                                
    The trend is that Wroughton will   
 not extend much further but any new   
 housing will go up in existing spaces 
 within the confines of the present    
 village boundaries.
