		<title>03Silverdale-a mining village</title>
		<content>Silverdale,once known as Knutton Heath,
was probably so called because of the  
silver birch trees growing in the      
valley which lies about two miles west 
of Newcastle-Under -Lyme.              
Iron was mined here as early as 1680   
and William Sneyd of Keele owned a     
forge in Knutton where the iron was    
flattened and sold for the manufacture 
of frying pans.                        
There are still traces of the old slag 
heaps and mine shafts around the       
village, but today there is only one   
coal mine,where many of the local men  
are employed.                          
The rows of terraced houses which made 
up the centre of the village,have now  
been largely demolished,and replaced by
a shopping complex and park.In the     
1950s Park Site estate was built to    
accommodate Durham miners who moved to 
this area.                             </content>
