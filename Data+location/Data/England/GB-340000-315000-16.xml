		<title>16FARMING AROUND MONTFORD</title>
		<content> The main land cover in this block     
 consists of very productive farmland. 
 A little over half is given over to   
 arable crops and the remainder is     
 intensively managed pasture.  The     
 major crops are sugar beet (which goes
 to the refinery at Allscott 12 miles  
 away), potatoes, wheat and barley,    
 grown in roughly equal proportions. Of
 the grass which is cut for winter     
 fodder, increasing amounts are        
 stored as silage rather than hay.     
                                       
                                       
 Dairy cattle, mostly Friesian, form   
 the largest part of the farm stock and
 a large number of beef cattle are also
 kept.  Some sheep are brought into the
 area from the Welsh hills in the      
 winter to graze on the local pasture, 
 sugar beet and other fodder crops.
