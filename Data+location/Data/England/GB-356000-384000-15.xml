		<content>{Moore Hall Ghost.                     
 One morning in the 18th cent.the aunt 
 of General Heron,owner of Moore       
 Hall,is said to have fallen over 2nd  
 floor handrail on to fixed bayonets of
 2 soldiers waiting to escort general  
 to Warrinton Academy.Family living    
 there now and some of their visitors  
 have sensed supernatural presence.    
 Sometimes dog stiffens and refuses to 
 go to Brown Room.Always circles       
 stair case and never goes upstairs.Cat
 frequently disappears and has twice   
 been found behind bolted door!Candles 
 go out and lights go on mysteriously. 
 On 3rd floor,where family do not sleep
 ,shuffling and scratching sounds heard
 as well as intermittant banging on the
 wall.Pendants have disappeared off    
 wearers necks without chains being    
 broken,one being found 3 days later.
