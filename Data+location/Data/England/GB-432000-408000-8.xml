		<content> We conducted a survey by sending a    
 questionaire to families of children  
 in each of the schools in our 4 times 
 3 km. block. We took a representative 
 sample of families in council         
  coalboard, and private housing.      
 These are our findings. Most families 
 are born and bred in Barnsley. Most   
 visit their relatives at least once a 
 week. Many families own or rent a     
 video so they only go to the cinema to
 see films like "Star Wars" or "E.T.". 
 On average each family visits the     
 cinema twice in one year. Other       
 occasional treats are eating out,     
 picnics and a day at the sea-side.    
 Several times a month most families go
 on car rides or country walks. Many   
 couples hardly ever go out without the
 children but those that do go to a pub
 or working men's club. (cont. next p.)
