		<content> MILLOM DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF PLACES  
 FOR PEOPLE TO GO AND DO THINGS. THERE 
 ARE LOTS OF PUBS BUT NOT MANY PLACES  
 FOR YOUNGSTERS.                       
 THERE ARE NO CINEMAS. THERE USED TO BE
 FILMS SHOWN TWICE A WEEK BUT NOW WE   
 ONLY GET A FILM AT CHRISTMAS. THE     
 PALLADIUM IS USED AS A SORT OF SPORTS 
 HALL. IT IS MARKED OUT FOR BADMINTON  
 AND YOU CAN ROLLER SKATE THERE        
 SOMETIMES.                            
 IT IS USED BY THE SCHOOLS FOR PLAYS   
 AND THE LOCAL OPERATIC SOCIETY USE IT 
 FOR SHOWS AND PANTOMIMES.             
 THERE IS A SMALL SWIMMING POOL AT THE 
 LOCAL COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL. ALL THE   
 SCHOOL CHILDREN GO DURING THE WEEK AND
 IT IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC ON SOME      
 SATURDAYS AND OCCASIONALLY DURING THE 
 HOLIDAYS.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
