		<content> This large historic house belongs to  
 the Earls of Bradford.  It is situated
 on the A5 between Gailey and Telford. 
 The house was built in 1674 and is    
 partly open to the public.  The       
 extensive grounds and parkland attract
 many thousands of visitors who come to
 witness Air Displays, Horse Trials,   
 vintage car rallies and the R.A.C.    
 Rally stage or simply to walk and     
 picnic.  Children are attracted to the
 park by an adventure playground and   
 miniature railway.  The park has deer 
 grazing and a recently developed      
 butterfly farm is also popular.
