     There are six arms on each        
 tower.One arm attracts the lightning  
 to itself but not to the others.      
 Occasionally lightning hits the other 
 arms.

 the Super Grid System and transforms  
 it down to lower voltages for smaller 
 Sub Stations which then sends the     
 electricity to the homes and factories</content>
