		<title>17WEST END FARM (1)</title>
		<content>West End Farm in Merton was purchased  
in 1965 by Mr R. Baker.It is the only  
working farm now situated within the   
village itself.Originally 326 acres in 
size,it has increased to 500 acres     
with the acquisition of nearby land.The
soil is partly clay loam and partly a  
lighter type over stone brash.The farm 
employs Mr Baker,two of his sons and   
another workman.West End Farm is       
typical of many of the local arable,   
highly mechanised farms of the area.The
crops grown include winter wheat and   
barley,spring wheat sown in mid march, 
potatoes and some oil seed rape.Many   
hedgerows have been removed to make    
field sizes bigger in order to         
accommodate the large machines that    
work the land.Much of the land lies on 
the flood plain of the River Ray.The   
Thames Valley Water Authority is liable
for the upkeep of the drainage ditches </content>
