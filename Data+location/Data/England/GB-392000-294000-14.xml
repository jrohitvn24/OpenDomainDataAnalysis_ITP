		<title>14Christ Church Coseley</title>
		<content>There are three churches within our    
vicinity but Christ Church is the      
largest;it was built in 1830. The Lady 
Chapel was built with the encouragement
of William Spencer, great,great uncle  
of the Princess of Wales. The stained  
glass window is by the Pre-Raphaelites.
The Chapel was begun in 1888,altered in
1897 and finally altered to its present
form in 1910. The "Resurrection" window
was added at the first rebuilding. Most
of the work done in 1910 was a copy of 
the pre Raphaelite style. The intricate
stenciling was based on the vine. It   
was carried out in green and purple and
gold. The window is considered to be   
worth 100,000 pounds. William Spencer  
was very rich but tragically died while
playing cricket on the nearby Coseley  
Cricket ground. The vicar (Rev J L     
Higgins has a strong connection with   
our school taking assembly once a week.</content>
