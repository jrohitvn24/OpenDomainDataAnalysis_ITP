		<title>18RETIREMENT IN BRAILES</title>
		<content>   Our forebears knew well the Brailes 
 of a hundred years ago and it was our 
 wish after a life in the Industrial   
 Midlands to retire to this graceful   
 landscape peopled by kindly country   
 folk.                                 
   A trait outstanding in Brailes      
 people is their friendliness to each  
 other and to newcomers. Nowhere is    
 this more evident than in the work of 
 the three churches and in the{Feldon  
{Club}- 'the retireds'very own self-   
 supporting group.                     
   Of great import to the retired is   
 the Post Office, a focal point in     
 village life, the monthly issue of the
{Feldon News}and the regular deliveries
 by local tradesmen who bring news from
 near and far.                         
   Finally there is the pleasure of    
 coffee mornings and the entertainment 
 and music given by village societies. </content>
