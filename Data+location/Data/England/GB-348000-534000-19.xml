		<title>19AN APPRENTICES LIFE</title>
		<content> As a 3rd year mechanical engineering  
 technician apprentice at British      
 Gypsum,Kirby Thore,I spend 4 days each
 week in the works and 1 day at        
 Carlisle technical College doing      
 engineering theory.The apprenticeship 
 lasts for 4 years,and leads towards a 
 higher T.E.C. Certificate.During this 
 time ,I will have worked in most      
 sections of the works , learning about
 the different kinds of machinery.At   
 this stage in my apprenticeship,I do  
 many jobs without supervision,working 
 with trained fitters on others.One    
 afternoon weekly is spent in the      
 apprentice training centre where      
 apprentices write up the jobs they    
 have done in special books.I work from
 08:00 until 16:30 with \hr for lunch  
 although a short period of the        
 apprenticeship is spent on an 8hr,3   
 shift system.                         </content>
