		<title>05SHOPPING IN DIDSBURY</title>
		<content>  Big city centres are trying to draw  
 shoppers to their stores but smaller  
{local shops}are still very important  
 to people.                            
  As parking a car becomes more        
 difficult in crowded areas, people    
 tend to visit shops they can walk or  
 take a bus to for their{everyday      
{needs.}They are then known by local   
 shopkeepers who are friendly and      
 helpful.                              
  Many people visit the shops everyday 
 especially older folks or those with  
 pre-school age children.At local shops
 they often meet their friends.        
  Here in Didsbury there is a good     
 variety of shops,but many people feel 
 that recently too many{building       
{societies}and{estate agents}have      
 opened.People are divided about       
 whether shops should open on a Sunday 
 or not.At present most do not.        </content>
