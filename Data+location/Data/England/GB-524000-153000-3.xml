		<title>03Dayly routine of a secretary</title>
		<content>    Here is an account of an average   
 day in the life of a secretary who    
 lives in Lower Kingswood, she is a    
 widow and works at a boarding school  
 in Gatton.                            
    After getting up, I prepare        
 breakfast for my daughters and feed   
 the dogs and the cat. My older        
 daughter takes my other daughter to   
 school (they catch the train to       
 Croydon). I then go down to see to the
 horses. I come back, get myself ready 
 and go to work.                       
    In the evening I return home and   
 usually have a short break. I probably
 walk the dogs, I might play tennis in 
 the summer, I may go riding if I can. 
 Later I do the jobs around the house. 
 I have an evening meal. After this I  
 often listen to some music or do some 
 gardening, hopefully have a read and  
 go to bed.                            </content>
