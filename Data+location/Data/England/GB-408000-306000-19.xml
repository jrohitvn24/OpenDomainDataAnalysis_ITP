		<title>19PIPE HILL PUMPING STATION.</title>
		<content>  The pumping station was constructed  
and brought into service in 1910 and   
electrified in 1973. The source of the 
supply is four boreholes sunk into     
Bunter Sandstone and pebble beds, the  
maximum depth of boreholes being       
169.5m.                                
  There are four vertical spindle, two 
stage borehole pumps and two Sulzer    
vertical four stage booster pumps. The 
average amount of water pumped daily   
is 2,850,000 gallons.                  
  Treatment consists of the addition   
of chloras into the suction tank.      
Fluoridation is to begin in 1985/86.   
  An alarm system gives out a signal   
in the foreman's cottage on site.      
  Pipe Hill supplies water to parts of 
the following areas:- Sutton           
Coldfield, Shenstone, Wall, Brownhills,
Aldridge, Little Aston, Walsall, Great 
Barr.                                  </content>
