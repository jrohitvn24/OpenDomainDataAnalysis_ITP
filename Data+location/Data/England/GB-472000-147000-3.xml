		<content> THERE IS NO LOCAL POLICEMAN IN OUR    
 BLOCK AND WHEN WE ASKED THE POLICE    
 IN FLEET,THE TOWN THAT IS RESPONSIBLE 
 FOR COVERING MOST OF OUR OUR BLOCK    
 THEY SAID THAT THERE WAS NO REAL CRIME
 IN OUR AREA. THE BIGGEST CRIME WAS    
 PEOPLE GOING TOO FAST ON THE COUNTRY  
 LANES. SOME PEOPLE BREAK THINGS AND   
 COMMIT VANDALISM, AND THIS CRIME IS   
 BECOMING WORSE BUT IS STILL NOT AS BAD
 AS IN TOWNS.SOMETIMES THE POLICE SAY  
 THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CRIME OF   
 PEOPLE TAKING WALKS THROUGH FIELDS    
 WHERE FARMERS ARE BREEDING BABY LAMBS 
 AND SOMETIMES THEY TAKE DOGS  AND     
 DISTURB THE SHEEP.  EARLIER THIS YEAR 
 THE POLICE FOUND A LOT OF VALUABLE    
 EQUIPMENT THAT HAD BEEN STOLEN AND    
 THEN HIDDEN AWAY BY THE THIEVES.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
