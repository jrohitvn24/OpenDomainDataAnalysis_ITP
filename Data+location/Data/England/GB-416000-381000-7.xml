      Most of the farms in the block   
 are{hill farms}producing{sheep}and    
{cattle}for meat.  Some however produce
 milk .  Almost all of the fields grow 
 grass for grazing, hay making and     
 silage.  Many farms are quite small.  
   We interviewed a farmer in{Bradwell}
 who specializes in{sheep}production.  
 The farm was 57 hectares.  This was   
 able to produce much of the feed but a
 little hay and a fair amount of corn  
 had to be purchased from outside.     
   The best land, where the sheep      
 fattened most quickly, was the        
 limestone side (west).  Each year the 
 lambs are sold for slaughter at       
 Hartington sheep sale where new ewes  
 for the next year are bought to       
 replace those that were too old to be 
 of further use at the farm.
