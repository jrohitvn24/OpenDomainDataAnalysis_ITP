		<title>18OUR DOMESDAY AREA</title>
		<content> The area in which we have to do our   
 Domesday study is only small but quite
 unique.In terms of natural vegetation 
 one of the most common plants is the  
 beautiful rhododendron with its large 
 characteristic purple blooms which    
 appear in a never ending supply in    
 spring and early summer.These shrubs  
 thrive on the acidic soil of the area 
 and are a common sight in the         
 driveways and gardens of local people.
 Being originally heathland,woodland   
 and bog there are many fine examples  
 of original deciduous trees and       
 introduced coniferous trees which give
 a shaded aspect to many of the gardens
 of the area.Up until recent years any 
 'waste'land was probably there because
 of it being poorly-drained bog. These 
 areas are fast disappearing under a   
 mountain of new housing estates as    
 engineers become expert in drainage.  </content>
