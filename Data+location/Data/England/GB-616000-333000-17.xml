		<title>17THE ALDBOROUGH COMMUNITY BUS</title>
		<content> The Community bus service was started 
 six years ago by Mr Hibberton.This was
 an idea put forward at a meeting in   
 the community centre because of lack  
 of public transport.The bus runs to   
 Sheringham,Holt,North Walsham and     
 Aylsham during the week and at        
 weekends does excursions eg.to Norwich
 for shoping and Theatre Royal,stately 
 homes and gardens,shows on Cromer pier
 and recently Cromer cinema .Elderly   
 people get half price.On average 12   
 people use the bus each journey.There 
 are 15 drivers all are voluntary.The  
 bus was a 12 seater but a new diesel  
 16 seater is now in use.There are     
 several picking up places.The         
 organizer of the bus is now Mr Carter 
 who is always adding new routes.      
 Richard Poynton did the research on   
 the community bus.
