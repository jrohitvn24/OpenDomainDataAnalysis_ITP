     In 1086 Andover was just a little 
 settlement surrounded by              
 forests.Gradually it grew into a      
 little market town and stayed like    
 that for hundreds of years.           
     Then in 1964 there was an         
 overspill and a lot of people came    
 from London to live in Andover.Before 
 the overspill Andover had 15,000      
 people but by 1970 there were about   
 32,000 living here.                   
     Mr Tempero was born in Enham just 
 outside Andover and he said that there
 used to be a railway station near     
 where Safeways is now.It was called   
 the Sprat and Winkle line because     
 before the railway line was built it  
 was a canal and the barges brought    
 sprats &amp; winkles to Andover.
