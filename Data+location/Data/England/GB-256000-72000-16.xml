  Although the Prison is the largest   
 employer of labour in the village     
 there are several other occupations.  
    Six people work for the Plymouth   
 Water Authority maintaining the local 
 water supply and leats. Five work for 
 the Duchy of Cornwall. Several work in
 the school and some in a near-by      
 quarry or in forestry.                
    Others are self-employed or work in
 small workshops provided by COSIRA in 
 Duchy buildings in the village or in  
 out-buildings at Tor Royal farm.      
    There is seasonal work in the local
 gift shops, hotels and cafes. Others  
 commute to Plymouth and Tavistock.
