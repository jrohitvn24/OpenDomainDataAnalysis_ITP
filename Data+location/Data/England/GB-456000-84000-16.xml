		<content> Newchurch village hall is next to the 
 church and there is also a school in  
 Newchurch, Newchurch C. of E. Primary 
 School.  Until the late 18th century  
 Newchurch was a busy village because  
 of it's{PARISH,}which was one of the  
 few on the island.  It also served the
 people of Ryde and Ventnor and up     
 until quite recently Wroxall.  But    
 Newchurch today is only a small       
 village in the country.
