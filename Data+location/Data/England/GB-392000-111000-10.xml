		<content> The last village school to close was  
 at Tarrant Gunville about 8 years ago.
 The children from Gunville and Hinton 
 now go to first school at Pimperne and
 Milldown Middle and Blandford Upper   
 School. From Chettle they go to       
 Sixpenny Handley then Wimborne.       
 School buses provide free transport   
 from chosen points long the route.    
 Some chidren are educated privately in
 other areas.                          
 There is a newly-formed playgroup     
 serving the Upper Tarrant Valley which
 meets in Tarrant Gunvill village hall.
 The old school building at Tarrant    
 Hinton is now an immaculate private   
 house, that at Gunville is owned by an
 enthusiastic orchid growing expert who
 has given much of the house over to   
 their cultivation.
