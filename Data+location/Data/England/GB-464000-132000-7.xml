		<content> GALA DAY:  Every year in our village  
 of Four Marks, we have a Gala Day.    
 This usually takes place in June.     
 This year, 1985, it was on Saturday   
 June 22nd.  On Gala Day there is a    
 procession of floats from Winston Rise
 to the Recreation Ground.  The floats 
 are judged and various cups are       
 awarded in different categories.      
      At the recreation ground there   
 are various stalls and acts in the    
 arena.  This year there was a clown   
 display and two members from the      
 British Trampoline Club.  There is    
 usually a slide, provided by Dan Air, 
 the local airline. It is a big        
 rubber slide, blown up with chalk put 
 on it to make you slide better.  There
 are also teas, cakes, ice-cream and   
 hot dogs available.                   
                                       
                                       </content>
