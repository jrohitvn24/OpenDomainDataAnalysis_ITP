		<content> Lived in Portchester for 27 years.    
 Her main problem is her inability to  
 walk.  Being physically handicapped   
 and confined to a wheelchair she is   
 denied access to certain buildings and
 the use of some forms of transport.   
 National problems are: Unemployment,  
 cuts in public services, deterioration
 of moral standards, behaviour problems
 eg violence, drugs and polution.  Her 
 solutions are: More discipline,       
 greater understanding on the part of  
 the government about the problems of  
 living, more employment opportunities 
 by lowering the pension age and       
 finally, more work experience for     
 school leavers.
