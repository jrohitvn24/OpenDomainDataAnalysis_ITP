		<content> The{Allotments}lie along the edge of  
 REDDISH VALE COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL's   
 playing fields. The{council owns}the  
 land and have divided it into plots.If
 a person wants to have an allotment he
 sees Mr.Flowers the secretary of the  
 allotments about it. People{grow      
 various kinds of{vegetables and       
{flowers}on their allotments, because  
 there is no tap water people have to  
 depend on the rain to water their     
 plants. one man we spoke to was making
 some hives ready for some bees. There 
 are quite{a few animals}on the        
 allotments; goats, pigeons, hens and  
 geese. One man kept his pigeons for   
 racing. People say the allotments have
 been there for many years. The        
 allotments were used to sell          
 vegatables but only a few people sell 
 vegatables or fruit now.
