 There is a mixture of architecture in 
 Sedgeberrow village, including several
 black and white cottages both thatched
 and tiled; terraces of Victorian      
 villas; 1 or 2 houses built of stone; 
 a Georgian house as well as the modern
 late 20th century buildings.  There is
 a small brick house opposite the site 
 of the old school where the school    
 teacher used to live.  There is a     
 large black and white farmhouse, the  
 oldest part of which is more than 400 
 years old.  Next door to this is      
 Church House, the oldest part of which
 was built in 1322.  This was used as a
 chapel by a hermit monk whose         
 gravestone is incorporated in the     
 flagstones of the hallway.
