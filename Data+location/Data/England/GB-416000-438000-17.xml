		<title>17Sarah and her friends</title>
		<content>{Sarah}is 14,and she has lived in      
 Thackley for a few months.The only    
 interesting things for her and her    
 friends are the Youth Club and the    
 Cricket Club.She moved to Thackley    
 from Bradford but she prefers Thackley
 there is more to do and the people are
 more interesting,since they seem to   
 share her hobbies,and there are more  
 people of her age.                    
{Joanne}came to Thackley from Colne in 
 Lancashire.Like Sarah,she enjoys going
 to the Youth Club,where she meets her 
 friends,both boys and girls.They dance
 play pool and darts and video games.  
 The only complaint the girls have is  
 that there is no park where the kids  
 can congregate in Summer.             
{Michelle}used to live in Wrose,and    
 wishes she were back there.She says   
 that there was much more to do,and    
 more kids of her age.                 </content>
