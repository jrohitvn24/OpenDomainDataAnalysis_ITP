The existing school in the village was 
built in 1875 to accommodate 200       
children; today there are 50 children  
on roll.  The changes in the           
organisation of education  today has   
meant that the children leave the      
village school at 9 years and travel by
bus to Clare Middle School . At 13     
years they transfer to Samual Ward     
Upper School in Haverhill. The buses   
are contracted by the Suffolk County   
Council.  The contract is presently    
held by Burtons Coaches (Haverhill)    
Ltd.
