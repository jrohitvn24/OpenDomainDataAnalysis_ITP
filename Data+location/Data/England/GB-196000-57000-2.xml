		<title>02THE CHINA CLAY INDUSTRY PT1</title>
		<content> The largest extractive industry in    
 Cornwall today is the mining of {China
{Clay}and the highest quality is to be 
 found in the area.                    
 The granite rock which forms the hills
 of Devon and Cornwall was subjected to
 severe faulting and folding about 300 
 million years ago.Geologists tell us  
 that it was during this Carboniferous 
 Period that kaolinisation of the      
 granite took place.Granite rock is    
 composed of quartz, mica and feldspar 
 and it is the {feldspar }in the       
 original granite that has been changed
 into the {kaolin. }                   
 The name {kaolin }comes from the      
 Kaoling Hills where China Clay was    
 first mined by the Chinese for use by 
 porcelain makers in the 7th Century.  
 The first man to discover China Clay  
 in Cornwall was {William Cookworthy } 
 who found deposits in the 18thCentury.</content>
