		<title>12PRESS RESERVOIR</title>
		<content> In the North_East corner of the parish
 of Ashover is Press Reservoirs.I live 
 by them and my father is responsible  
 for looking after them.There are two  
 huts by our house and they were built 
 in 1890,and so they have been there   
 for 95 years.                         
 The biggest reservoir is 4.46 acres in
 area (1:80 hectares.)and the smallest 
 reservoir is 3.125 acres (1.35        
 hectares) .All the reservoirs put     
 together hold 31,000,000 gallons.The  
 three reservoirs put together cover   
 1.6 hectares and their catchment area 
 is 202 hectares.The  reservoirs are   
 now used for fly fishing and lots of  
 people come to fish.There are also a  
 lot of wild and nesting birds around  
 them and it is becoming an important  
 wild life area.
