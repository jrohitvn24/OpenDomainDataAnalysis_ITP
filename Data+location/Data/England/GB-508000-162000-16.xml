		<title>16A Shopping Survey</title>
		<content> We went to Queens Road to interview   
 people on their shopping habits. We   
 asked them questions on changes they  
 had seen, and future changes they     
 would like. We interviewed 30 people  
 altogether,most of whom had lived in  
 the area between 2 months and 47      
 years. People had seen many changes in
 Queens Road:-there was more traffic   
 and they had seen shops closing and   
 different ones opening.               
 Many people actually shopped here     
 every day. Of those who did not, most 
 shopped here twice a week.            
 We asked people which main towns they 
 used as well. Most shopped in Kingston
 the rest shopped in Richmond, London, 
 Surbiton and Addlestone.              
 Most people we interviewed would have 
 liked to have a Marks &amp; Spencer       
 locally.
