		<title>15The Weston Turville Players</title>
		<content>    There are not many forms of        
entertainment in Weston Turville,and   
people travel elsewhere for a          
professional show.One of the few       
entertainments  is a group called the  
Weston Turville Players who put on     
shows in the village hall.There        
are serious,funny and musical shows    
produced.Some time ago Cinderella was  
shown,and more recently there was      
Oliver Twist.The next production is    
planned to be Pickwick Papers.         
    The members of the group are       
ordinary  people who have a job during 
the week but enjoy putting on the      
shows.Rehearsals take place on a Sunday
and are very enjoyable.
