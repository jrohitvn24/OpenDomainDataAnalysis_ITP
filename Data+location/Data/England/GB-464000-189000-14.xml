		<content> Ewelme has a Parish Council which     
 comes under the larger South          
 Oxfordshire District council. There is
 a Chairman of the Council at present a
 lady. She sees the task of the Council
 as looking after the interests of the 
 village. The six people who are on the
 council meet every two months in the  
 village hall. They discuss items such 
 as Finance, Sports Clubs, the use of  
 the Common for grazing and other      
 purposes, sitting for Travellers, and 
 the use of land for gravel pits.      
 Money is mainly raised from two       
 sources, the fees from grazing, and   
 the raising of rates. A recent rate   
 increase was levied to help pay for   
 the new Village Hall. Elections take  
 place every four years.
