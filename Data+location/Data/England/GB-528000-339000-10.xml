		<title>10THE OLD RAILWAY LINE</title>
		<content> This runs through the parish in a     
 northerly direction. It is used by    
 people for walking and children as a  
 play area. It acts as a nature reserve
 throughout the year supporting a      
 variety of flora and fauna.           
 In 1985 it was found that there were  
 23 species of wild flower, 3 species  
 of grass, 3 of trees, a variety of    
 birds nesting and animals living on   
 the line. The water drain at the side 
 of the line supports a number of fish 
 and newts.    {The ecology}covers a   
 wide range of natural things man has  
 used in his daily life, which are now 
 not used, although we still collect   
 elderberries and blackberries to make 
 jam, wine and use as fruit.           
 This area is soon to become the A16   
 by-pass and its ecology will change.
