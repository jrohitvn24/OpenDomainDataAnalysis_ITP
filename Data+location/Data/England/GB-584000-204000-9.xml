 bottom of Wick Hill near the A414 and 
 extends to Hazeleigh Wood.It covers 16
 acres.The reserve is mainly for wild- 
 life and is an excellent place to see 
 insects,birds,animals and trees.Twenty
 six species of butterfly are there.The
 rarest are the White Letter Hairstreak

   The reserve runs along a disused    
 railway track and is cared for by vol-
 untary workers.The last train ran in  
 1953.There is a great variety of trees
