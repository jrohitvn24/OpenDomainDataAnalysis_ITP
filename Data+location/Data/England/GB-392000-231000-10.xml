		<title>10Living at an Army Camp 2</title>
		<content> This is what I think about living in  
 an Army Camp.Living in an army camp   
 has its good points and its bad       
 points.It is a very big place so there
 are lots of places to go.The only     
 problem is that once you've seen a    
 place once you don't won't to go      
 again.Sometimes when you're down in   
 the dumps you feel like you're in     
 prison because there are fences       
 everywhere. There is a play park with 
 see saws, a slide and some swings.    
 There are garages for you to put your 
 caravans in.The houses in the camp are
 quite nice and they are reasonably    
 big.I have a back garden like most    
 people.We have a front garden as      
 well.There are big fields for you to  
 play on or walk round.I think its     
 quite good living on a army camp.
