		<content> THE MOST COMMON THEORY ABOUT THE      
 DERIVATION OF MELBOURNE'S NAME IS THAT
 THE SPELLING IN THE ORIGINAL DOMESDAY 
 BOOK "MILEBURN" MEANS THE MILL STREAM.
 THIS IS THOUGHT TO BE THE MOST LIKELY 
 EXPLANATION."MELBURN",AN ALTERNATIVE  
 SPELLING,MEANS THE SWEET STREAM AND   
 "MELDBURN" DENOTES THAT MELD,A WEED   
 EATEN IN SAXON TIMES GREW             
 PLENTIFULLY AROUND HERE.MELBOURNE HAS 
 ALSO BEEN CALLED THE PLACE OF SWEET   
 SPRINGS BECAUSE OF ITS PLENTIFUL WATER
 SUPPLY OF SPRINGWATER.                
 HISTORICAL SITES IN THE AREA INCLUDE A
 MEDIEVAL HOLY WELL WHICH HAS RECENTLY 
 BEEN RESTORED BY THE CIVIC SOCIETY.   
 THE SAD REMAINS OF A NORMAN CASTLE CAN
 BE FOUND IN CASTLE FARM.MELBOURNE IS  
 THE BIRTHPLACE OF THOMAS COOK,OF      
 TRAVEL COMPANY FAME.THERE IS ALSO AN  
 HISTORICAL LINK WITH MELBOURNE,       
 AUSTRALIA,WHICH IS OUR SMALL "SISTER".</content>
