		<title>03STAINLAND VILLAGE</title>
		<content>      There are only eight shops in the
 village, a butcher, two general       
 stores, a baker, a chemist, a post    
 office, a hairdresser and a tile and  
 kitchen centre, so when the villagers 
 want to do a large amount of shopping 
 they usually travel to Halifax or     
 Huddersfield. There are plenty of pubs
 The Duke of York, The Red Lion, The   
 Bull and Dog and The Rose and Crown.  
 If anyone's car breaks down it can be 
 repaired at the Black Horse Garage.   
      The village school was built in  
 1882, and there are now approximately 
 180 children attending it.This is     
 what some of them think about         
 Stainland. "I think it is a friendly  
 place. It is very cold in winter."    
 (Cathie  Holden).  "I think Stainland 
 is a nice place to live, but sometimes
 it smells because of the muck         
 spreading." (Melanie Tetlaw).         </content>
