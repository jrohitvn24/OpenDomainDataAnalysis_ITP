		<title>20Matthew's Pets</title>
		<content>  The{dog}is the second pet we ever    
 had.  She is about 3 years old and    
 about 50 centimetres high; She is fed 
 every night.  One of the{cats,}called 
 Tatty, is our oldest pet and our other
 cat, Purdy, is about 18 months old,   
 (Tatty is about 12 human years).      
                                       
  I also have 2{American Garter Snakes 
 which are red sided, their names are  
 Dennis and Daisy.  Daisy is the       
 bigger.  They are fed every day on    
 worms or fish.                        
                                       
  The 2{terrapins,}Terry and George,   
 are quite old.  They are fed on fish  
 also.  The{rabbit}and the{mouse}both  
 belong to my sister and eat the same  
 sort of things.  We have 9 baby       
{goldfish}and 1 grown up one.  5 are my
 sister's and 5 are mine.
