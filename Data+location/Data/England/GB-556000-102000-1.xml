		<title>01WILLINGDON</title>
		<content>   The area designated "Willingdon"    
 comprises part of the South           
 Downs,Upper and Lower Willingdon,     
 Willingdon Trees and part of Polegate.
   A spur of the South Downs separates 
 Upper from Lower Willingdon.The former
 is an older and more affluent area    
 than the latter. Willingdon Trees is  
 the most recently developed area;it is
 separated from the rest of  Willingdon
 by the busy A22 road, which is rarely 
 traversed by pedestrians except by a  
 subway at the Triangle and at traffic 
 lights.                               
   There is little employment in the   
 area as a whole, other than normal    
 service industries. Retired people    
 form a large part of the population.  
   The Downs do much to enhance the    
 beauty of the area and the nearness of
 the sea is an added attraction of     
 living here.                          </content>
