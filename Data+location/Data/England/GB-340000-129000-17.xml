		<content> High Ham is the only village in       
 the block to have a post office.The   
 Sub-Post Office is open on Mondays,   
 Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 9.00am to
 1.00pm and from 2.00pm to 3.00pm.     
 About 30 pensioners collect their     
 pensions and 20 mothers their family  
 allowance from this Sub-Post Office.  
 There had always been a Post Office in
 the village until 7 years ago when it 
 closed. After a lapse of 3 years it   
 re-opened in people's homes.Taunton   
 Post Office is the head office. The   
 Sub-Post Office in High Ham can issue 
 pensions and family allowance, sell   
 stamps and television licences,but it 
 cannot take in savings, offer car tax 
 or sell premium bonds. It also sells  
 cards, wrapping-paper and stationery.

 10am and 4pm, and delivers post to the
 houses in the area once a day.        </content>
