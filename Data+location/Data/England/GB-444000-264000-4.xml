		<title>04RELIGION-BROADWELL</title>
		<content> Broadwell has two Chapels but no C.Of 
E. Church.One of the Chapels belongs to
"The Church of the Good Shepherd",this 
is alongside a house in the village.   
Services are held once a month.        
 The other Chapel is a Methodist one.It
was built in 1872 by Thomas Walton for 
100 Pounds.The Metodist Church had a   
lot of influence on village life,this  
is why there is no Public House.The    
Church is linked with Methodist        
Churches in Dunchurch,Grandborough and 
Daventry,with whom it shares Ministers,
as there are not enough people to have 
a Minister just for Broadwell.The      
Church publishes a quarterly magazine  
called "The Vine".The Church also has  
a a  choir,and holds a Fete in the     
summer.
