		<title>12ORCHIDS OF WYCHWOOD FOREST</title>
		<content> The {ORCHIDS }are one of the largest  
 flower families in the world,with up  
 to 30,000 species.Within the forest   
 six types have been identified, but   
 there are {hybrids }also. The most    
 often seen are the {COMMON SPOTTED    
{ORCHID }and the {TWAYBLADE.}Rarer     
 are the {PYRAMID ORCHID }and {EARLY   
{PURPLE ORCHID,}while very rarely      
 seen is the {SOUTHERN MARSH ORCHID}.  
 Avery rare hybrid is the {LEOPARD     
{MARSH ORCHID,}which is a cross between
{SOUTHERN MARSH ORCHID }and the{COMMON 
{SPOTTED ORCHID. }The {BROAD LEAVED    
{HELLIBORINE }is another rare orchid   
 sometimes seen in the forest.         
    Unfortunately orchids are a favour-
 ite {food }of the {Fallow Deer}and    
 many plants have been eradicated by   
 them over the years. Others are in    
 danger from meadow and bracken mowing
