		<title>15Nomansland Nature Trail</title>
		<content> The Nature trail is managed by the    
 Hertfordshire and Middlesex Trust for 
 Nature Conservation. The common was   
 used as grazing land for 3000 years   
 but it was stopped in the 1950s. At   
 the same time myxomatosis killed off  
 many rabbits. This affected the plants
 because sheep and rabbits used to eat 
 the little seedlings so not too many  
 trees would grow but now trees have   
 grown up so most of them are 20/30    
 years old. The ground cover is acid   
 heathland it is one of the few        
 remaining habitats of its kind in     
 Hertfordshire. Typical heathland      
 plants that grow on the common are    
 common gorze, heather, furze and petty
 whin which is very rare.Trees which   
 have grown up are hawthorn, sycamore, 
 silverbirch, aspen and hazel. Nettles 
 and silverweed grow where the land has
 been disturbed.                       </content>
