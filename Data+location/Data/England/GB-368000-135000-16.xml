		<title>16       Housing</title>
		<content> There has been very little house      
 building in the surrounding           
 countryside of our grid block,perhaps 
 minor improvements to farm buildings  
 but no major housing development.     
        There are many more houses now 
 in the small part of our area near    
 Quaperlake Street than there were in  
 the past.The age of this housing      
 varies tremendously,from the earlier  
 part of this century (or earlier)to   
 the present day.                      
        There is also variety in the   
 type of                               
 housing,detached,semi-detached,terrace
 d,private and council owned properties
 are all in evidence.                  
        A new,small development has    
 almost been completed opposite the    
 Unionist Club.
