		<title>05The land to the east of area</title>
		<content> We drove down Betty Bells lane,it was 
 a bumpy ride over the ruts.We think it
 was probably a cart-track.Then we came
 to land owned by Mr.N.Bell.Most of    
 this land was used as grassland ,about
 85% of it.The other was used for      
 crops,linseed,oilseed                 
 rape,barley,wheat and peas.The fields 
 were mostly divided by stake fencing. 
   Next we came to a large field of 24 
 acres.It was probably big bacause it  
 had had a hedge taken out to allow the
 machines to work more easily.         
   There were a few wild flowers in the
 hedge bottoms,a few poppies,violas and
 alot of cow parsley and nettles!      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
