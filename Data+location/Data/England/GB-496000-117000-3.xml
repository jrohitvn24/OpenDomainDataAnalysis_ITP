		<content> The indigenous population, originally 
 predominently agricultural have, over 
 the years gradually lost their        
 importance to this part of West       
 Sussex. A few children live in the    
 area but there are far more people of 
 pensionable age. A large house is at  
 present being converted into a        
 residential rest home.                
 The majority of the local inhabitants 
 do not now work in the area of the    
 survey, but commute to the main       
 centres of employment in Horsham,     
 Crawley, the south coastal towns, and 
 to a lesser extent, but by no means   
 insignificant, to London and its      
 surrounding urban spillover.          
 The area is also a desirable area     
 in which to live, thus making more    
 problems for those few remaining local
 workers because of the effect on house
 prices and rents.                     </content>
