		<content> About 1250 servicemen with their      
 families and single men and women live
 at the USAF Base. They reflect a true 
 cross-section of American society.    
 Recruitment is nationwide, but N.E.   
 America provides many with the right  
 technical background. Barriers may    
 exist due to rank, but not to social  
 class.The remaining 50 or so other    
 residents live mostly in scattered    
 houses and,among them, some Americans.
 The forestry and farm workers are     
 mostly locally born and bred but one  
 or two families live in this relative 
 isolation from choice. There are no   
 statistics to show that intermittent  
 aircraft noise has a deleterious      
 effect on health. With the regular    
 posting-in and out of servicemen an   
 average age of below 30 is maintained,
 happily avoiding problems of death and
 old-age, at least at the base.        </content>
