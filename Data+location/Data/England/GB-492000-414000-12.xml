		<title>12TRADITIONAL USES OF STRAW</title>
		<content>    With the decrease in livestock     
 production and the increase in the    
 growth of cereals, the production of  
 straw has far outstripped its         
 traditional uses.                     
{1. Animal Feed_}Straw has minimal food
 value unless treated with chemicals or
 molasses but a lot of experimental    
 work is being done on this at the     
 moment. Straw is fed as a roughage.   
{2. Animal Bedding_}The increasing     
 costs of hauling straw long distances 
 has made farmers look for other       
 methods of bedding stock.             
{3. Fuel_}Straw is potentially a very  
 useful source of fuel. Several        
 thousand boilers are in use in the UK 
 at the moment, using either bales of  
 straw or brickettes.                  
{4. Building Materials_}Some processes 
 have been developed for turning straw 
 into a variety of compressed boards.  </content>
