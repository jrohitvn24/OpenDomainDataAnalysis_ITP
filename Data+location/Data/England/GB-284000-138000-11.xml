		<title>11Devon County Show,Exford</title>
		<content> Every year my family goes to Devon    
 County Show,I hadn't been before.We   
 decided to go on Friday because it is 
 not so busy.We arrived at the big     
 field near Exeter and walked up the   
 dusty track.First we had an ice-cream,
 then watched the horses.After that we 
 had dinner in a tent.Next we saw the  
 goats and sheep parade in the ring.   
 Then it was the hounds turn,they mixed
 them up together.The Exford huntsman  
 couldn't ride his own horse because it
 hadn't had an injection.I wanted to   
 buy the dogs a lead,Mummy said that I 
 could if they were under Â£1 but I     
 didn't find one.I had some sweets and 
 lemon, then we all met by the ring at 
 6.00 o'clock.We had a big cooked tea  
 when we got back to Nans and then went
 straight to bed.                      
                                       
                                       </content>
