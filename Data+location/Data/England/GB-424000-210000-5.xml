		<title>05Jobs in Burford</title>
		<content>Nearly two thirds of Burford people who
have jobs work in the town. Those who  
have no regular paid jobs are mainly   
older folk above the age of sixty. Men 
and women hold full time jobs in shops 
and trade, in hotels and pubs, in      
building and service industries and the
professions. Quite a lot of women also 
work part-time but only a few men. Most
people who are employed outside the    
Burford area work in Witney, Carterton 
or Oxford, or within a fifteen miles   
radius of the town. A  few people work 
further afield including one person who
commutes by air. Local job vacancies   
are advertised at the Post Office. A   
number of individuals work seasonally, 
particularly in jobs connected with the
tourist industry and farming.          
Unemployment is not considered to be   
an overwhelming problem locally.
