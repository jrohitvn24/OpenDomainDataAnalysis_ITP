		<title>05The Ryedale Folk Museum</title>
		<content> The museum was opened in 1964 by Mr   
 Bertram Frank, with his own private   
 collection combined with that of Mr   
 Crosland,displayed in his barn.This   
 was increased by local gifts.         
 In a field behind the barn , a working
 blacksmith's shop was built, followed 
 by reconstruction of an old cruck     
 cottage, a manor house, a later cruck 
 cottage,an Elizabethan glass furnace,a
 crofter's cottage, a barn and wheel-  
 house and some shops, all built by Mr 
 Frank with voluntary labour.In 1979 Mr
 Frank retired and now the museum is   
 run by a curator and 3 paid assistants
 managed by a secretary and Board of   
 Trustees. Doorkeepers are volunteers. 
 Local crafts are demonstrated and this
 year these have been increased.In 1984
 the museum entrance became a Tourist  
 Information Centre. About 52000 people
 look round the museum each year.      </content>
