		<content> Girls play games such as skipping     
 which requires a rope, which is swung 
 around and then jumped over or hop    
 scotch which requires numbered chalked
 squares and a pebble. Boys play       
 football, rugby, cricket and tennis.  
 Girls enjoy playing rounders. At      
 school swimming is taken each week.   
 In the playground games such as tick  
 and chase or jumping over a piece of  
 elastic stretched between the legs are
 games invented by children. Bulldog is
 an old game played by two teams. One  
 person from a team tries to reach the 
 area of the opposing team. It is quite
 a rough game but good fun.            
 Board games such as draughts,         
 monopoly, snakes and ladders are games
 played indoors. Many different kinds  
 of card games are also played by      
 children who also sew and knit.
