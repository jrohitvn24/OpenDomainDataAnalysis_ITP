		<content> The next four pages describe typical  
 farms in our area.                    
  {CHURCH FARM}in Stanton is an        
 arable and dairy farm of around 300   
 acres.Sugarbeet is grown for the      
 factory and grass for the cattle and  
 for making into{haylage.}             
   The farmer has lived there nearly   
 all his life, and he hopes his        
 children will carry on after him.He   
 goes to{Crewe}and{Shrewsbury}market.He
 does not like footpaths on his land   
 because people trample on his crops.He
 hires{contractors}and uses{artificial 
{fertilizers.}                         
  The farmer said that there is a{Roman
{Encampment}called{Rutunium}under one  
 of the fields.The farm is in the{     
{village}which is inconvenient because 
 the cows have to walk down the village
 street.                               
                                       </content>
