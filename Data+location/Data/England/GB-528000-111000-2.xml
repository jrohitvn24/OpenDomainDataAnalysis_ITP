		<title>02CLAYTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Clayton village lies at the base of   
 the Downs.It is a small village       
 without shops,the only amenity is a   
 letter box.An elderly resident gave us
 information on how the village has    
 changed during her lifetime.          
 Early this century Clayton was a small
 farming community consisting of       
 families who had lived there for      
 hundreds of years.The present Jack and
 Jill pub used to be tiny with a       
 village shop beside it.The local      
 school now the village hall had       
 between 20 and 25 pupils all of whom  
 were taught by one teacher.           
 Today the character of the village has
 changed,the cottages have been        
 modernised,they have central          
 heating,large gardens and swimming    
 pools.The people who live there are   
 mainly commuters.Visitors are tourists
 to the windmills or Downs walkers.    </content>
