		<title>03MOVING INTO CHESTERTON</title>
		<content> We went to Loveday's Removals on the  
 Industrial Estate to find out how     
 people move house.An estimator calls  
 and lists the furniture to be moved.He
 gives a price based on time to pack &amp; 
 distance to travel.The removal men    
 wrap the furniture in paper blankets &amp;
 pack it into large wooden boxes in a  
 special side loading van.An average 3 
 bedroomed house needs 3 boxes.If a new
 home is not ready the containers are  
 stacked 3 high by fork lift trucks in 
 warehouse otherwise they are unpacked 
 at the new house straight away.Glass, 
 china,books,carpets and larger items  
 are packed and unloaded separately.   
 This firm deals with about 40 moves a 
 week.Once a month a journey to London 
 is arranged carrying small lots,items 
 from many customers,combined into one 
 van load to save carriage charges.
