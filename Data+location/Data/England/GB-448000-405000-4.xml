 Bournemouth.Some of the{artists}come  
 and demonstrate their crafts in the   
 village school.There are gouache,water
 colours and oil paintings.The prices  
 of the{paintings}range from Â£5.00 to  
 Â£300.00,last year Â£1000 was raised    
 from 15% commission from the artists  
 and the sale of refreshments to be    
 used for church purposes.A great deal 
 of interest is aroused and visitors   
 come from a wide area attracted by the
 quality of the work.It is one of the  
 few chances local art lovers and      
 collectors have to participate in such
 an event.A childrens art festival with
 work from local schools is held in the
 school at the same time.              </content>
