		<title>06APPEARENCE OF CHURCH</title>
		<content>                                       
 The earliest church was probably a    
 wattle hut(made of mud) in existence  
 before the Norman conquest but it had 
 no churchyard. In 1099 a church was   
 built for the convinence of the local 
 land owner and his tenants so that    
 they might have a burial place.       
 Over the years extra sections were    
 added to the church.The tower was     
 built about the year 1220 and has a   
 unique lean-to recess.In the late     
 13th century the church was           
 considerably enlarged probably  to    
 cater for an increased population     
 employed in distilling salt from      
 the sea.                              
 What the church looks like.           
  The church looks very old with worn  
 stone work and with a square Norman   
 tower.The tower has a clock face and  
 there is a flag and a weather vain.   </content>
