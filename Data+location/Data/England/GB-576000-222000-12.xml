		<content> There have been people living in and  
 around Braintree from the Bronze age  
 onwards. Major settlement have tended 
 to develop in two areas. The Chapel   
 Hill and Skitts Hill part of the      
 present town have been inhabited since
 at least the fifth century B.C. The   
 other area is at the crossroads now at
 the centre of the present town,       
 developed by the romans an important  
 meeting of roads from colchester to   
 st Albans and Chelmsford to Gosfield. 
 At the time of the Domesday Survey the
  community at Chapill Hill was larger 
 and with more facilities than that at 
 the cross roads and so had become more
 important.
