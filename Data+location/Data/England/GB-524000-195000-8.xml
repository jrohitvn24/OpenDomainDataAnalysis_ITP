		<content> PARTS OF BARNET ARE JUST LIKE A       
 VILLAGE,EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE SO CLOSE 
 TO THE CENTRE OF LONDON. ALTHOUGH     
 THERE ARE SOME LARGE SHOPPING CENTRES 
 THERE ARE ALSO A GREAT NUMBER OF SMALL
 AND FRIENDLY SHOPS IN MANY AREAS.     
 ONE OF THE EVENTS THAT ARE HELD IN THE
 AREA THAT MAKE IT LIKE A VILLAGE IS   
 THE VILLAGE FAIR THAT IS HELD EVERY   
 OTHER YEAR ON OAKHILL PARK. IT IS A   
 BIG FAIR WITH LOTS OF STALLS, WHICH   
 ARE RUN BY THE LOCAL PEOPLE AND THE   
 NEARBY SCHOOLS. THIS YEAR THERE ARE   
 GOING TO BE GAMES, COMPETITIONS,      
 HOME-MADE JAMS AND CAKES, FACE        
 PAINTING, LOTS TO BUY AND A LOT OF    
 OTHER STALLS.                         
 IT IS GOOD FUN AND EVERYBODY ENJOYS   
 THEMSELVES,HELPING ON STALLS AND      
 SPENDING LOTS OF THEIR POCKET MONEY.
