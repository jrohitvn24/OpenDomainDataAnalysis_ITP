		<content> Although primarily a residential area,
{12 Hectares}of the grid area are used 
 for farming, centered mainly around   
{Reedes Farm.                          
 The light,well-drained,sandy soil is  
 ideal for a variety of crops which are
 grown on a market-garden basis.These  
 include Brassicas,root vegetables,    
 salad crops, soft fruits,tomatoes     
 (under glass)and potatos,all of which 
 find a ready wholesale market in the  
 industrial hinterland of Merseyside.  
 Some produce is sold direct to the    
 public via farm shops.                
 Fields are rotated and fallow land,   
 under grass, provides winter feed for 
 dairy herds in the region and helps to
 provide fodder for the riding schools 
 in the vicinity.                      
 Over the past 10 years increasing     
 demand for homes has resulted in much 
 farmland being developed for housing. </content>
