		<title>01THE KIRKBURTON DISTRICT</title>
		<content> Most of the twelve squares in our     
 block are grass which is used  for    
 grazing, silage or hay. There are a   
 few woods scattered about with farms  
 and cottages here and there.The most  
 interesting places are Emley Moor T.V 
 Mast which is an  outstanding landmark
 that can be seen from many miles away 
 and Gryce Hall where Lord Savile      
 lives, although there are also other  
 places such as the Old People Home a  
 Roman Catholic Church and a corner    
 shop. which get most of its trade from
 the children who attend Kirkburton    
 Middle School. There is a mine at     
 Emley Moor and several disused pit    
 shafts in the district. Although there
 isn't much to do in the way of        
 entertainment, children go to riding  
 schools and youth clubs, Cubs, Guides,
 Scouts, and Brownies.
