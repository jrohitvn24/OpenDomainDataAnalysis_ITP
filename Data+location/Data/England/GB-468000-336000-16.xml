		<content> On the first Thursday evening of each 
 month some 50 ladies of 17-91 years   
 hurry to the Village Hall (as they    
 have done for the past 65 years) to   
 attend the{Institute}meeting. Here,   
 for example, they discuss national    
 issues, or learn about the National   
 Trust or British Telecom, watch a     
 make-up demonstration, and chatter one
 with another. The December meeting is 
 a Christmas Party. The August meeting 
 is an outing; this year a cruise on   
 the canal was followed by supper at a 
 wharfside restaurant. In July a Garden
 Party is held to raise funds to       
 provide a Christmas present to every- 
 one in the parish over the age of 70. 
 This year we were awarded the Silver  
 Trophy at the Newark Show for the best
 entry in the Notts. Federation of     
 Women's Institutes.
