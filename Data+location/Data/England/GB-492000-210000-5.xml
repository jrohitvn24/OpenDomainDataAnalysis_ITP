		<content>   Members of a Dacorum council sub    
 committee set up to consider the issue
 were told that Bucks county council   
 now included Tring town and Tring     
 rural parish.Aldbury parish and       
 Wigginton parish in its list of       
 proposals to the commission.          
   The report went before Dacorum's    
 policy committee last week and it was 
 agreed to restate the borough's       
 opposition to the proposals for       
 Tring.It is quite clear that Tring and
 Dacorum councils are against Tring and
 some other towns being put into       
 Buckinghamshire from Hertfordshire.
