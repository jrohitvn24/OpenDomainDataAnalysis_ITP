 green every Guy Fawkes night.There is 
 also a Christmas party every year in  
 the village hall where the children of
 the area play games and have food     
 while the parents sit and watch.Local 
 people arrange the many activities    
 that go on during the year.           
            Local people also arrange a
 youth club every Friday.In the summer 
 they do outdoors activities and in    
 the winter they have games in the     
 village hall.On special occasions,such
 as Christmas and anniversaries,the    
 children from the Sunday School       
 perform a play in the hall.
