		<title>12The Ghost of Porch Cottage</title>
		<content>{Porch Cottage}is one of a row of three
 cottages in{Withycombe Village}Road;  
 they all used to be one cottage. There
 have been many reports of sightings of
 this ghost in Porch Cottage garden and
 sometimes in the house. When my       
 grandad lived there he kept some      
 chickens and every night they made an 
 awful noise.Even in the heat of       
 summer there was a cold spot at the   
 bottom of the garden. One spotting of 
 the ghost was by Simon Oldham.{"What I
{saw was a blue glow with white        
{patches",}he said. Other proof we     
 have is a photograph taken that shows 
 a glowing shape at the end of the     
 garden. We believe it is the ghost of 
 someone who died in Porch Cottage.
