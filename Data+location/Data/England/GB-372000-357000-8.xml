		<title>08Wheelock May Day</title>
		<content>   We have had a{May Day Festival}in   
 Wheelock for many years. The Festival 
 was a grand affair in the late 19c.   
 and early 20c.In the old days it was  
 held on St Mary's football ground in  
 Wheelock Road. A large number of      
 people assembled to watch the         
 procession and the crowning of the May
 Queen.The procession started from the 
 school at one o'clock headed by the   
 Sandbach Band and then walking through
 the village,singing at Green Bank.    
   Nowadays we have a procession of    
 floats, all decorated in different    
 ways.The floats have their own theme, 
 and each organisation dresses         
 everybody up to match.The Brownie Pack
 dressed up as witches and the         
 playgroup dressed up as Old McDonald's
 Farm.There is a prize for the best    
 dressed float and the best dressed    
 shop.                                 </content>
