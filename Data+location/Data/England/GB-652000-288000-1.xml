		<title>01PAKEFIELD TO KESSINGLAND</title>
		<content>Our area is divided between land and   
sea. The shingle beach is the home for 
several 'longshore' boats which make up
the local {fishing} fleet. There is a  
low cliff on the edge of which stands a
medieval church, destroyed during World
War II and completely rebuilt in its   
original style.  To the north there is 
a concentrated residential area and a  
growing industrial estate.  Much of our
area is agricultural land, used for    
both livestock and for arable          
{farming}. Tourism is encouraged by a  
holiday camp which caters for a large  
number of holiday makers each year.  A 
busy trunk road passes through our     
area, carrying many types of vehicles  
but public {transport} is infrequent.  
There is evidence of past {industry} as
well as a varied ecology.
