		<title>18Transport in Knockholt</title>
		<content> Most people in Knockholt are car      
 owners. Many families have more than  
 one car. Teenagers have motor bikes.  
 The bus service is very limited. The  
 471 runs every two hours to Orpington,
 the nearest town and railway station. 
 There is a service to Sevenoaks, but  
 the last bus back leaves at 5.40pm.   
 Special buses take children to school 
 in Sevenoaks, Tonbridge and Tunbridge 
 Wells. Children stopping after school 
 for sports or clubs have to rely on   
 parents to fetch. Children who attend 
 the Primary School walk or are taken  
 by car. They are allowed to cycle when
 they have passed the test in Cycling  
 Proficiency. All the Knockholt roads  
 are minor ones and are affected by the
 winter weather; lanes are often       
 blocked with snow. Nearby are the A21 
 and the new M25 Motorway giving quick 
 access to London and the South coast. </content>
