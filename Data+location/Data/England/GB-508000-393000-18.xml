		<title>18A DAY IN MY LIFE -2</title>
		<content>   Awakened at 6.30 am by radio, had   
 black coffee made by my husband, Tim. 
 I got up and woke up our daughters    
 Emily aged 10 and Rebecca age 14,     
 Katrina aged 15 was already awake and 
 playing her flute. The first job was  
 to let out our three dogs and one cat 
 while putting out their food. Tim left
 the house at 7.15 am, then I prepared 
 breakfast of apple juice, cereals with
 milk and tea. Whilst the girls ate    
 their breakfast I prepared chicken    
 soup for the evening meal. At 8.30 am 
 the girls left for school and I tidied
 the house, before leaving for Caistor 
 Yarborough School where I am a        
 part-time English teacher. During the 
 hour's lunch break I did some shopping
 and returned to school for a meal of  
 cheese and salad.(Continued page 19)
