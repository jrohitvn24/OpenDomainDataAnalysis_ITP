		<content>        The Red Lion Inn, Babcary is   
 well situated at the end of the main  
 street of Babcary, and it is licensed 
 to sell wines,spirits and tobacco.    
        The owner told us that the pub 
 was quite busy most evenings, but even
 more so on Friday and Saturday        
 evenings The pub is not a residential 
 one,as the name suggests.             
        It is thought that the main    
 building was built in the Fourteenth  
 Century.                              
        The pub opens at eleven o'clock
 in the morning,and at half past six in
 the evening. There are three main     
 rooms on the ground floor and there is
 also a garden behind the pub, where   
 people like to go on summer evenings. 
 The pub is also reputated for having  
 good food.
