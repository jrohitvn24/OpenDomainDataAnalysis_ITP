		<title>18A typical farm in Hurworth</title>
		<content>     Oxen_Le_Fields is a 240 acre mixed
 arable family farm, which has been    
 passed down since 1912. The farm      
 itself dates back to the 11 century.  
     The crops grown are: winter and   
 spring wheat, barley, peas, beans,    
 potatoes, grass and oilseed rape.     
     The wheat goes to a Newcastle     
 flour mill, barley is for malting (to 
 a farming co_operative), beans for    
 animal feed, potatoes sold to local   
 merchants, the grass used for hay and 
 silage. The oilseed rape goes to      
 crushing mills at Hull and Liverpool. 
     There is a herd of 25 beef cows.  
 The calves are reared until one year  
 old and then sold.                    
     Three people work full time on the
 farm, and there is much machinery.    
     The farm receives some subsidies  
 from the Common Market eg. for oilseed
 rape.                                 </content>
