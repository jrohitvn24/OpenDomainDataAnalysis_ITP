		<title>04Giants come to Stansted!</title>
		<content> The inhabitants of Stansted alongside 
 a quarter of a million others were    
 witness to a once in a lifetime       
 spectacular recently.A Boeing 747     
 (JUMBO) flew over the village to the  
 local airport with its 'piggy back'   
 passenger -the space shuttle          
{"Enterprise".}The space orbiter and   
 crew stayed on exhibition for 3 days. 
 The tranquil life of a typical Sunday 
 in Stansted suddenly exploded as      
 200,000 people travelled to the       
 airport to catch a glimpse of space   
 technology.After its 3 day stay the   
 shuttle and its mother plane left for 
 its flight home to America.           
                                       
 A 5 day stay by an airship{'Europa'}on
 its European tour brought thousands of
 people to the village giving them the 
 chance to lapse into history of Early 
 Flight.                               </content>
