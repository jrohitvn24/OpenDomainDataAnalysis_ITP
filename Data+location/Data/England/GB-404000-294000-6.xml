		<content> Recently, a new large{supermarket}has 
 opened in the area. The store covers {
{60,000 square feet}and has car park   
 spaces for 600 cars. There are        
 different kinds of departments for    
 household goods, clothes and food.    
 There are large fridges for frozen    
 food as well as tins and packets on   
 shelves. In the bakery section there  
 is a manager, his assistant and three 
 bakers. A confectionary lady makes the
 cakes and a man makes the doughnuts.  
 There is also a large butchery area.  
 Fresh fruit and vegetables are laid   
 out so you can choose. Some people    
 work at night to mark on prices and   
 fill up the shelves. Shoppers put     
 their goods in a trolley and take it  
 to a cashier who looks at your goods  
 and enters the prices in a colour     
 coded electronic till. She tells you  
 how much to pay and gives any change. </content>
