		<title>11Communications In Mayfield.</title>
		<content> Mayfield has its own small Telephone  
 Exchange,a comparatively new building 
 to replace the old one which was      
 totally demolished by an explosion in 
 1978.The Exchange is of particular    
 significance to the Primary School in 
 Mayfield as a 'Time Capsule'was placed
 by them in the foundations of the new 
 Exchange during its construction.The  
 metal box contains photographs,coins, 
 tapes &amp; other articles which will be  
 of interest to archaeologists of the  
 future.                               
 Mayfield has 2 Post Offices &amp; many    
 post boxes scattered throughout the   
 village.There are 2 deliveries each   
 day,both in the morning,&amp; 2           
 collections per day,1 in the morning  
 &amp;1 in the afternoon.As Mayfield is so 
 rural push_bike &amp; foot_rounds are not 
 common.Instead P.O.vans deliver the   
 mail.                                 </content>
