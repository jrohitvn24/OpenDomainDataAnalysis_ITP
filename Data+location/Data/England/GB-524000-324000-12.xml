		<title>12MY GRANDAD'S SCHOOL DAY (2)</title>
		<content>    In the afternoon we wrote a        
 composition and then reading,         
 geography and histroy and perhaps     
 some painting or drawing. At 4.00 we  
 went home. It would take us until 5.30
 to get home because we played chase   
 and catch  with a donkey witch was    
 left to grange by the side of the     
 road.                                 
    When I got home tea would be       
 ready. We would have plain steam      
 pudding and gravy first and then      
 followed by stew and vegetabels out of
 the garden. After tea at about 6.30 my
 brother and I would feed our 5 horses.
 Before we went in we fed the rabbit   
 again. We then had our supper of      
 bread, cheese and milk. At 8.30 it was
 time for bed for my brother and I in  
 our feather bed.                      
                                       
                                       </content>
