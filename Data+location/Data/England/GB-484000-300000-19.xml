		<content> Two factors are combining to link the 
 study area with the Midland towns to  
 the west (e.g. Leicester and          
 Birmingham) and East Anglia. Firstly  
 there has been the construction of the
 new by-pass. Secondly there is to be a
 re-alignment of Wardley Hill on the   
 A47 just to the west of the area.     
 Wardley Hill is currently a long,     
 winding hill which generally retards  
 the flow of heavy goods vehicles and  
 in winter sometimes stops it          
 completely. The Rutland District      
 Council is currently looking for      
 potential industrial development sites
 in th Uppingham area, especially      
 between the town and the by-pass.     
{      The Rutland and Stamford Mercury
 of 18 October 1985 reported an        
 application for planning permission   
 for a Happy Eater restaurant at the   
 A47/A6003 roundabout.                 </content>
