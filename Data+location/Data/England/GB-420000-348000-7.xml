		<title>07HOGNASTON POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> Hognaston Post Office is at the side  
 of the main road going through        
 Hognaton.It has a small pull-in so    
 that drivers can park there cars off  
 the road.                             
 From the outside it looks like a long 
 white washed house.There is a sign to 
 show that there is a Post Office.The  
 Post Office is in one end of the      
 building.Inside,the counter is        
 separated into two sections because   
 apart from being a Post Office it is  
 a shop and both parts have to be kept 
 separate.In the shop part all sorts of
 things are sold.There are fresh foods 
 as well as tinned,dried and frozen    
 ones.There are sweets,chocolates and  
 cigarettes.There are toys,buckets,    
 brushes,spoons and many more things.  
 The people who use the shop are mainly
 local people but some passers-by do   
 call in/especially in summer.         </content>
