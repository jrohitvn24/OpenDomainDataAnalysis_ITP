		<title>15Pocket money in Stockwood.</title>
		<content> We did a survey about the amounts of  
 pocket money that children in our     
 school were given. We found that the  
 older the person the more money they  
 got. Most of the younger infants have 
 no pocket money at all. Most of       
 the older infants had between Â£0.25p  
 and Â£0.50p per week but average pocket
 money for the older children was      
 between Â£0.75p and Â£1.00 per week.    
 Only a few children had more than     
 Â£1.00. When we asked what they spent  
 their pocket money on most children   
 said they saved it up. A few said     
 they saved some but spent a little on 
 sweets. Only one person said that they
 spent their money on magazines and one
 on fruit. Only two people said that   
 they spent money on drinks. 18        
 children said that they  spent all    
 their money on sweets. 4 said they    
 spent their money on comics.          </content>
