		<content> The extraction of the sand it expected
 to finish in 30 to 40 years' time.    
 The land will be turned into          
 agricultural land, the quality of     
 which will greatly improved because   
 the sand has been removed.  The quarry
 will be filled in when the extraction 
 has finished:  this will take 3       
 months.                               
 Many birds, including sandmartins,    
 nest around the quarry because the    
 trees are not disturbed.  The workers 
 are careful to extract the sand from  
 in between the trees.                 
 There is a large element of risk,     
 both financially and physically. Large
 fences have been put up to keep out   
 trespassers, who might ruin the equip-
 ment or might be hurt on the machines.
 The financial dangers are that        
 planning permission might be refused  
 after the land has been bought.       </content>
