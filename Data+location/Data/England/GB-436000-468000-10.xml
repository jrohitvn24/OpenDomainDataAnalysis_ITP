		<content> Each year in Skelton and Kirby Hill   
 the churches hold Garden Fetes but in 
 Skelton there is also an annual Gala  
 which began in Jubilee Year.          
 On Gala Day we have a show. We enter  
 some things like handwriting and      
 painting of a woodland scene. We enter
 an animal made out of vegetables. They
 all ge t judged and there is a Fancy  
 Dress and a Gala Queen. There are lots
 of stalls and a Tombola. There are    
 races and there is a parade down the  
 village and a band. You can buy tea   
 and biscuits. We have a disco at      
 night.
