		<title>03GASCOIGNE WOOD COAL MINE 2</title>
		<content> As well as this they carry a flame    
 safety lamp to detect gas.Each shift  
 produces 16000 tons of coal therefore 
 in one day  48000 tons of coal is     
 extracted from the mine.50 coal trains
 come every day to collect 1000 tons of
 coal each.They arrive every half hour,
 they take a circular route from       
 Gascoigne Wood to Drax Power Station. 
 The coal board bought 164 acres of    
 land from the farmers to build        
 Gascoigne Wood.When the building is   
 finished some land will be returned.  
 They own a lot of machinery such as   
 the Road Heading Machine which cuts   
 the rock.Underground they have three  
 different types of trains some run on 
 diesel, some are battery powered and  
 some are rack and pinion for going up 
 steep slopes.
