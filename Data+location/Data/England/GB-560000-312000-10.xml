		<title>10Local villages</title>
		<content> The main village in the block is      
 Wiggenhall St.Germans (now usually    
 called St.Germans) with - just across 
 the river Great Ouse - a much smaller 
 settlement called Wiggenhall St.Peter.
                                       
 The village of Setchey is largely a   
 commuter area for nearby towns (ribbon
 development along the main A10 trunk  
 road), with a developing housing      
 estate (owner occupiers) at the       
 north-east corner of the block.       
                                       
 At the south-east is a very small     
 hamlet - Tottenhill Row - which is a  
 small collection of farm labourers'   
 dwellings on a dirt road.
