		<title>18BURNHAM MARKET GROUP SURGERY</title>
		<content>   The surgery is purpose built and    
 took eighteen months for the doctors, 
 in consultation with the architect, to
 plan it. It is built in the shape of a
 traditional Norfolk barn and has      
 consulting rooms for four doctors     
 together with a large treatment       
 room which houses the most up-to-date 
 medical equipment. The surgery was    
 built on previously very marshy ground
 which had to be drained, and the      
 village stream seems to have flowed   
 faster ever since!                    
    The building has won many          
{architectural awards}. In 1985 it     
 received a Civic Trust Commendation   
 and a R.I.B.A. (Royal Institute of    
 British Architects) awards - one of   
 only two such awards in the Eastern   
 Counties. It has also won a R.I.B.A.  
 energy efficiency award.
