		<title>20ST OUEN'S BAY (NORTHERN END)</title>
		<content> This bay is the largest in Jersey and 
 is five miles long approximately. A   
 lot of activities are held on the     
 beach including sand racing, with     
 motor cars and motorcycles, and water 
 sports. The most popular activity at  
 the northern end is swimming. Some    
 surfing also takes place.             
                                       
 Swimmers are helped by being shown    
 where it is safe to swim because the  
 safer areas are marked by two flags.  
 These flags are red and yellow. The   
 area between the flags is watched all 
 the time by the beachguards and they  
 rescue people who get into            
 difficulties.                         
                                       
 When it is too dangerous to swim the  
 beachguards put up a red warning flag 
 and advise people not to go into the  
 water.                                </content>
