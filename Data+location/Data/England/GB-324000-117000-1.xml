		<content> Staple Fitzpaine is the village in the
 centre of this agricultural area.  The
 population is very small and those    
 that live here tend to be living off  
 the land and live in tythed cottages  
 or farms.   The Portman family still  
 live at the Manor House.   The Portman
 Alms houses we restored in 1970.   A  
 new centre for the elderly to live in 
 called 'Ladyacre' has been opened by  
 the council.  School closed 14 years  
 ago.   Nearby Taunton and Pickerage   
 Golf Club.  A private club and 600    
 members.  Established 1892.   It has a
 tree planting scheme.   West hatch    
 acre - Farmers Arms public house with 
 new nightclub/disco 'Raffles'.   Also 
 animal rescue centre opened by RSPCA  
 in 1963.   Open daily for wildlife    
 casualties and stray domestic animals.
