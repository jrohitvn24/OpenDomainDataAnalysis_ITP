		<title>14Cadets at the T.A. Centre</title>
		<content>  Cadets arrive at the Centre at 7pm.  
They fall in, do drill, have a NAAFI,  
take part in various activities and are
dismissed at 9.30pm. New recruits      
practise shooting in the rifle range   
using air rifles. They can also go     
running and do map-and-compass         
practice. On Tuesday nights there is   
a first aid  course and Thursday night 
is band practice.                      
  Cadets also go on a week-end camp.   
  During the year they take part in    
public events such as the Suffolk Show 
and Bury St. Edmunds Carnival. On      
August 4th 1985 they are doing a       
pageant for Domesday. Later they leave 
for a fortnight's camp at Folkestone   
where they will go out on battlefields 
and take part in activities such as    
parascending, canoeing and             
watermanship  drill.
