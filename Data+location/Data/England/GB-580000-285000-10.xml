		<title>10LEAVING SANTON DOWNHAM</title>
		<content> Although local buses between Thetford 
 and Brandon, and a Norwich_Cambridge  
 coach, pass through the block along   
 the B1107, there is no stop. The      
 village is served only on Tuesdays by 
 a shoppers' bus and local firms       
 coaches on random routes; people may  
 also use the school bus. The Cambridge
 _ Norwich railway runs through the    
 area, following the L. Ouse river, and
 crosses the very minor road by an     
 automatic crossing; the nearest       
 stations are Brandon and Thetford.    
 The nearest airports are Cambridge and
 Norwich. The river was navigable until
 the beginning of this century, but    
 awkward stanches without locks had to 
 be negotiated. Remains of old landing 
 stages can still be seen at Santon.   
 Personal transport, or a strong pair  
 of legs, is essential for the local   
 populace.                             </content>
