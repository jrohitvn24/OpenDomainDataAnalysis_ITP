		<title>14THE MINERS' STRIKE</title>
		<content>  Approximately one year ago the       
 biggest pit strike ever broke         
 out.There were a few reasons but one  
 in particular.                        
  The NATIONAL COAL BOARD were going to
 close a certain pit called {          
 CORTONWOOD.First of all they had an   
 overtime ban but when that didn't work
 they came out on strike.This caused a 
 lot of concern for the NCB because    
 there was not enough coal being       
 produced.The strike continued for     
 nearly a year.Some people carried on  
 working in the pit however and this   
 led to many problems.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
