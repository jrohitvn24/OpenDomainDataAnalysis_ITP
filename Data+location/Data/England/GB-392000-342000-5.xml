		<title>05Changes in the Meir area</title>
		<content>     Meir used to be a small village   
with only one major road and a very    
small population.During the last 40    
years many changes have taken place in 
the area.                              
     The local pub-Kings Arms-was once 
a small country pub,the Community      
Centre was once a farm that had lots of
birds and wildlife in the woods that   
surrounded it.                         
     One of the latest proposals is to 
construct a new By-pass through the    
area,many people are opposed to the    
idea particulary older people they     
thinkthat the community will be cut in 
half by the new road and crossing the  
proposed road will be very difficult.
