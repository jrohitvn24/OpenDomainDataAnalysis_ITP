		<title>07Housekeeping at Chatsworth</title>
		<content>     Chatsworth House is open daily    
 from March until October from 11.30am 
 to 4.30pm. It is cleaned every day by 
 six ladies who dust and polish, and   
 two men who do all the vacuuming of   
 the carpets and then help with the    
 selling of guide books.               
                                       
     In the winter when the House is   
 closed all the walls and windows are  
 cleaned and the furniture and floors  
 polished. All the china is washed and 
 the crystal chandeliers are taken down
 and cleaned.                          
                                       
     Furniture and fabric restoration  
 is also carried out when the House is 
 closed to the public but still lived  
 in by the family.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
