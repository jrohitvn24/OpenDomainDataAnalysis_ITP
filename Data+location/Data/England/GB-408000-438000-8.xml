		<content> In my family there is Daddy who works 
 for a Building Society, Mummy who does
 not go out to work, Matthew and Polly 
 who are my younger brother and sister 
 and me Emma. We get up at 7.45am and  
 have breakfast. Mummy takes us to     
 school and Daddy goes off to work in  
 Bradford.                             
 On Thursday, Mum cleans the local     
 church and helps with the Senior      
 Citizens' Luncheon Club. She collects 
 Matthew from play group and they have 
 lunch. I have lunch at school. Mum    
 cleans the house, she collects Polly  
 and me from school at 3.30pm. When we 
 get home we watch T.V. After tea I go 
 to Brownies. At 8.00pm I go to bed.   
 Visitors come to our house for a      
 meeting. At about 11.30pm Mummy and   
 Daddy go to bed. Homelife is fun.
