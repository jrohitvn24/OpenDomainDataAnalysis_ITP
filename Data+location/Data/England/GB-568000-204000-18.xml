		<title>18HYLANDS HOUSE CHELMSFORD</title>
		<content> Hylands House was built in 1728 for   
{Sir John Comyns}who was then Member of
 Parliament for Maldon.It is a large   
 elegant building with 8 cellars and 30
 main rooms. The Ionic style portico   
 with four columns was added later.It  
 remained a family home until 1962 when
 the last private owner died. The House
 and surrounding 440 acre Park were    
 bought by{Chelmsford Borough Council}4
 years later;the Park since being      
 opened to the public.                 
 Over the last 20 years there have been
 many suggestions as to what plans     
 there could be for Hylands House and  
 Park.One suggestion was to turn the   
 House into flats.{The latest idea  is 
{to use the grounds as a golf course   
{and the House as the clubhouse.}      
    This is causing much local debate  
 at present,as there are mixed feelings
 about the proposal.                   </content>
