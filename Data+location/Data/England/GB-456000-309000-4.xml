		<title>04BIRSTALL PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> Birstall Parish Council came into     
 being in 1894. It is made up of 21    
 Parish Councillors (elected every 4   
 years), 2 County Councillors and 3    
 District Councillors. The Parish      
 Councillors must live within 3 miles  
 of Birstall. The council owns and     
 maintains 3 playing fields, a         
 cemetery, some allotments and they are
 responsible for street lighting except
 on main roads. They employ 3 part-time
 workers to run offices on Sibson Road.
    At the monthly meetings, vandalism,
 litter and the state of the playing   
 fields are discussed. A meeting in May
 discussed objections to proposed      
 toilets for the shopping centre and   
 the date of a Medieval Banquet to be  
 held when Birstall receives guests    
 from Rixensart, its twin town in      
 Belgium.
