		<content> Most of the residents have gardens and
 grow both vegetables and flowers, the 
 village organises a flower show in    
 September and most enter their produce
 and crafts making a fine display.     
 Other recreation is catered for by    
 various village clubs, such as the    
 youth club which organises sporting   
 events with other villages, arranges  
 trips and sponsered events. The       
 swimming club, hires the pool at      
 Appleby for 1 hour, on Monday nights  
 during the summer. The badminton club 
 meets in the village hall on Wednesday
 evenings and occasionally arranges    
 matches against other teams. The      
 children join girl guides, brownies   
 and cubs at Kirkby Thore. Domino's,   
 darts and pool can be played at the   
 Stag Inn, Gullom. People also travel  
 outside the area for other            
 recreational activities.              </content>
