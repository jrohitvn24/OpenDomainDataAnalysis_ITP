		<content>     We learn many subjects at our     
 school.  They are English, maths,     
 reading, French, computer work, art   
 and crafts, music and social studies. 
     The clubs we have are chess,      
 cricket, badminton, short tennis,     
 hockey, football and the book club. We
 are able to use the Sports Centre for 
 some of our activities.               
     South Cave is mainly a farming    
 area and the children come to school  
 by bus, taxi, car or walking.         
     Once a week Mr. Shimwell, our     
 vicar comes to school to take our     
 assembly. Every week each class takes 
 it in turn to do a play for our       
 religious education.                  
     Most children stay at school for a
 school dinner or a packed lunch.
