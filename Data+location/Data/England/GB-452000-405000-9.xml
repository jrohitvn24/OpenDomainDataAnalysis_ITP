		<title>09SCAWSBY HALL AND FARM 1</title>
		<content>    {Scawsby Hall}and Farm is rented by
 Mr and Mrs John Harrison. They only   
 rent the bottom half of the stone hall
 most of which is Tudor,some far older.
 There's said to be a ghost, which the 
 Harrisons call Charlie, who was one of
 the rebels camped on{Scawsby Lees}and 
 slaughtered in the hall.              
    Mr Harrison now farms 270 acres of 
 land. The farm has grown smaller over 
 the years to make way for two schools 
 (one of which is ours), a college and 
 a housing estate. This summer they are
 growing sugarbeet,wheat,barley,rape,  
 and a few potatoes. The rest of the   
 land is used for grazing calves,cows  
 and bulls.They breed their own calves,
 fatten them for about two years then  
 they are killed for meat.             
     Combine harvesters,beet harvesters
 and tractors with lots of attachments 
 are all used to work the land.        </content>
