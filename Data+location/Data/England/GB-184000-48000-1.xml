		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> Our area is basically farm land but   
 also covers a small residential       
 district.This residential area was    
 once two very  small villages known as
 Trispen and St Erme.Six years ago a   
 private housing estate was begun on   
 land between the two villages.This    
 estate has now completely joined the  
 villages together.Building on the     
 estate is continuing with a present   
 phase of fourty eight houses under    
 construction.Also being built at the  
 moment is a development of twelve     
 council houses.                       
 The farms in this block are mostly    
 dairy but cereals are also grown as   
 are some vegetable crops and early    
 flowers.                              
 The block is close to Truro(3 miles)  
 and most of the people living in this 
 area use Truro for shopping and all   
 the services this small city can{offer</content>
