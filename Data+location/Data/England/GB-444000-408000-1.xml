		<title>01South Kirkby/Elmsall Area</title>
		<content>{South Kirkby,Moorthorpe,South Elmsall 
{and Frickley}were all mentioned in the
 Domesday Book.All were agricultural   
 until 1900,when the{Barnsley coal seam
 was opened up,and Kirkby,Moorthorpe   
 and Elmsall grew rapidly to accomodate
 the influx of miners.Many of the old  
 terraced houses have given way to     
 modern houses and private estates.    
 Though set in the industrial{heart of 
{Yorkshire,}there is beautiful         
 countryside and beautiful walks within
 minutes of the villages.Until the     
 1960's the main source of employment  
 was the mines,but now the emphasis has
 changed and diversified to other      
 occupations.Recently,by Govt.         
 directive,the area has become an      
{Enterprise Zone,}helping to offset the
 unemployment situation.This survey has
 highlighted the lack of many          
 cultural and leisure amenities.       </content>
