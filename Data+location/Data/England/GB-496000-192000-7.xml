		<content>The Princess Marina Centre is for physi
cally handicapped people.There are 53  
residents living there,each with their 
own room.The centre was built 30 years 
ago on the site which was originally   
Ponds Farm,the farm buildings having   
been incorporated into the design of   
the complex.The residents move around  
in wheelchairs which they operate with 
their feet or hands.They may choose    
from a wide range of activities:yoga,  
woodwork,basketry,collage,knitting,sew-
ing,pottery,painting,cooking,gardening,
French,history,English,literature,play-
reading and computers.The swimming pool
has recently been opened complete with 
jacuzzi.The water is kept at 96 degrees
Fahrenheit.Hydrotherapy is used to     
improve muscle tone and the action of  
the jacuzzi relaxes the body and       
increases circulation.
