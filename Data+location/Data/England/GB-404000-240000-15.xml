		<content>  Some crops are hydroponically grown  
 (which is water with the correct      
 amount of fertilizer circulated in    
 polythene channels). Many plants are  
 grown in small blocks of rockwool.    
 Peat blocks are also used, and there  
 is very little cultivating. The glass 
 houses are now heated by gas.         
       Some growers produce their own  
 seed, but some is purchased from      
 Holland. The peat is purchased from   
 Russia.Much of the equipment comes    
 from Holland,glass is from Russia or  
 East Germany.                         
        Evesham has many large         
 transport firms and some have         
 insulated wagons and can reach any    
 part of Britain by the next morning.  
        Hills nursery on the A44 road  
 sells bedding plants, shrubs and      
 trees. They are open to the public and
 tourists but most customers are local.</content>
