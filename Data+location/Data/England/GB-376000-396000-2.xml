		<content>  The Eccles Journal was established   
 in 1874. The owner was called         
 Tillotson. Since then it has been     
 taken over twice and is now owned by  
 N.C.N. of Bolton. It was first        
 situated beside the Bulls Head in     
 Church St. In 1927 it moved to its    
 present address. It employs 3         
 reporters and advert staff and 2      
 counter staff in the Eccles office. It
 costs 62p for four lines in a small   
 advertisement and 22 pounds for an    
 advert up to 8 by 8 cm. A full page   
 advert cost 360 pounds. This gives the
 Journal about 5,000 pounds a week. The
 Journal is printed in Bolton  every   
 Tuesday.It is printed using the       
 following method. Each piece is       
 photographed onto sticky backed paper.
 This is arranged to make the page,    
 then put on to a metal plate for      
 printing.                             </content>
