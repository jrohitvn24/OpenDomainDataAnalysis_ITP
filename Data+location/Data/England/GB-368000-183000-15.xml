		<title>15FARMING IN NORTH YATE</title>
		<content> Quite a lot of the area to the north  
 of Yate is farmland.We talked to a    
 local farmer about his farm.We asked  
 him what he liked best about being a  
 farmer,and he said the way of life,   
 and his love of nature.The machinery  
 he uses is reasonably modern,with     
 tractors and silage cutters.The only  
 animals he keeps are steers,and all   
 his land is used for grazing.The      
 animals also eat high quality silage. 
 The size of the farm is 40 hectares.  
 The present owner of the farm,Frank   
 Pryor,bought the farm from a relation.
 The buildings he has on the farm are a
 straw barn,an implement shed,and      
 there is also a covered cattle yard.  
 He very rarely hires any extra labour.
