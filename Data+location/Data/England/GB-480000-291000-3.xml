		<content>  There is an abundance of water from  
 natural springs and the River Welland 
 which occasionally floods small areas 
 of land during the winter months.     
 Coarse fish are present in the river  
 and ponds which attract the Grey      
 Heron, Kingfisher, duck and geese.    
 Parts of the disused railway and      
 quarry are uncultivated and provide a 
 haven for wildflowers, grasses,       
 rabbits, foxes and birds. The old     
 pastures support hare and partridge-  
  on the slopes of the hill a large    
 badger set. Pheasants are reared in   
 Holt Wood to supplement the wild      
 population.  The rookerys in the      
 villages have been somewhat diminished
 due to the removal of elms with Dutch 
 Elm disease. Wild blackberries,sloes  
 and mushrooms are gathered in season  
 but may soon disappear due to modern  
 farming methods.                      </content>
