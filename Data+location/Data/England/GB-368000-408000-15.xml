		<title>15CONVENT LIFE 2 ,BOLTON</title>
		<content>  The clothes that the nuns wear vary  
 all over the world.The nuns at our    
 school usually wear a black skirt,    
 jumper and veil and a white blouse. It
 is up to them if they wear a white    
 band on their veil.In some parts of   
 the world the veil is not worn and    
 the colours are not just black and    
 white.                                
  The nuns enjoy life because they work
 in the service of Christ and his      
 children; also they are part of a big 
 family which is spread throughout the 
 world.                                
  In their spare time the sisters      
 knit,visit friends,walk and have other
 hobbies.                              
  The sisters know that the convent    
 will change in the future
