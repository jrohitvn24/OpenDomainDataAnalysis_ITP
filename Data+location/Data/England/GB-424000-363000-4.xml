		<content> My sister and I leave home for school 
 at 8.35a.m. We meet our friends and   
 walk along School Lane together. This 
 takes about five minutes. After school
 I normally play out on my roller      
 skates. We have tea at five, then I   
 read, sew or weave. My parents are    
 artists. Mum's work begins after we   
 have left for school. She goes into   
 the studio and embroiders and paints  
 her pictures which sell all over the  
 world. She made the Church altar cloth
 (l98O) representing the Trinity. The  
 cloth is green - the colour of Trinity
 with a cental arc (the heavens) and   
 the cross outlined in gold thread     
 representing the Light. Dad puts Mum's
 work together and assembles the       
 frames. He answers the post and the   
 telephone, and sends Mum's notelets to
 different parts of England and foreign
 countries.                            </content>
