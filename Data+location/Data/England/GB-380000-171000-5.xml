		<content> Slaughterford is a village 3km away   
 from Colerne. Slaughterford has a     
 church, but it is quite small it would
 hold a congregation of about 40-50.   
 The church was left in ruins for 200  
 years because it was ransacked by     
 Cromwell. It was rebuilt in 1823 but  
 the original tower still remains.     
                                       
 There are still remains of an old rag 
 mill which was driven by water. Most  
 of the water wheel is made of iron and
 the spokes are wooden. A few metres   
 away there is an oven which was used  
 for baking bread.                     
                                       
 Slaughterford used to be on the main  
 route for coaches to go from London to
 Bath.There used to be stables for the 
 horses,an old brewery,a coach house,a 
 water pump for all the houses,four    
 weavers cottages and a lodgers house. </content>
