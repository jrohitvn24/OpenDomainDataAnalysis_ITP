		<title>03The Boot Inn</title>
		<content> The inn is known to have existed in   
 1632 when it was the first, or last   
 staging-post on the Salisbury-Bath    
 stage-coach run.                      
 It has been suggested that The Boot is
 so named as it was on the pilgrim     
 route to the shrine of John Schorn, a 
 Buckinghamshire parish priest whose   
 prayers were said to be effective     
 against blindness, toothache and gout 
 and who was said to have conjured the 
 Devil into a Boot.                    
 The present tenants are determined to 
 preserve the unique atmosphere of this
 pub:no modern furnishings, but a      
 scrubbed wooden floor and wooden      
 fittings. No juke-box either, as the  
 clientele are encouraged to play the  
 traditional games of Shove-halfpenny, 
 Darts, Crib, Dominoes or Bar Skittles.
 Only tradional ales,drawn from the    
 wood, are served.                     </content>
