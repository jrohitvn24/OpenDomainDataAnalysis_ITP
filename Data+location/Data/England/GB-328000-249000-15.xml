		<content> Children in our school like to{play   
{cricket}in the summer.They play on the
 school field.Cricket is an outside    
 game for children and adults.You need 
 a bat and a ball.Our boys get very    
 angry if you don't play properly.We   
 also play tag where someone is on,they
 have to catch the others.Stick in the 
 mud is a sort of tag game.When you    
 are caught you have to stand still    
 with your feet apart until someone    
 crawls under to free you.             
 Most{girls}like to play with{dolls.   
 We have Sindy dolls.They are made of  
 plastic,about 30cms.high.You can buy  
 lots of clothes for them as well as   
 houses,horses,cars and pools.Boys like
 Action men.These are the same height  
 but have lots of army equipment.Lego  
 is good for boys and girls.It is      
 different plastic shapes that fit     
 together to make all kinds of models. </content>
