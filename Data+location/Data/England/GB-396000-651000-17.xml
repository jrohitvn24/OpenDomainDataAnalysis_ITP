		<title>17TRANSPORT IN BERWICK</title>
		<content>  Berwick is on the main East Coast    
 railway from London to Edinburgh via  
 Newcastle. 12 passenger trains per day
 call at Berwick on their way north, 13
 on the way south.There are about 50   
 passenger trains using the line each  
 day, but very few goods trains.The    
 main goods yard at Tweedmouth is      
 almost closed.It is used by coal      
 merchants,a builders'merchant and as a
 waste collection area.The branch line 
 to Cornhill was closed in 1963.The    
 route is partly a footpath,partly the 
 E.Ord by-pass and partly farmland.    
  The main A1 trunk road used to run   
 through Berwick,causing traffic       
 problems in the Town centre.A by-pass,
 opened in Oct.1983,now takes through- 
 traffic around the Town and nearby    
 villages.The route is 8.7km long,uses 
 a new bridge but caused loss of some  
 farmland.Few people were disturbed.   </content>
