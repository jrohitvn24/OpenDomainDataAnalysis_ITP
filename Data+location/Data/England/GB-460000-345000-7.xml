 On this page we will be looking at    
 a second example of a small business  
{Floralands Garden Centre}in Lambley.  
 One Thursday afternoon 20/6/85 we     
 went to Lambley.We went to ask for    
 the manager,and a woman went to get   
 him.The manager said go out side      
 to the restaurant so we did .The      
 manager went to get us a drink of     
 orange.We asked the manager some      
 questions.We asked the manager        
 if it was a family business and       
 it was.There were lots of green       
 houses and plastic garden ponds.      
 In 1880 there was a nursery,in 1880   
 they wouldnt know what a garden       
 centre was.Floralands is open all     
 year round apart from Christmas       
 day and Boxing day.
