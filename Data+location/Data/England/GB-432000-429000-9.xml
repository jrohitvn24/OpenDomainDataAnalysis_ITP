		<title>09Skelton Grange Power Station</title>
		<content>      Last Wednesday some of the group 
 went to{Skelton Grange power station. 
 We had to walk there, passing the     
{sewage works}on the way. It smelled so
 bad that it nearly made me sick.      
      When we arrived we watched a     
 video on the power station. It told us
 how{electricity}was made. Then they   
 gave us some{helmets.}They had        
{ear-muffs}on them.                    
      We had a look at the things that 
 were at the bottom of the building,   
 like the{turbine}machines. Then we saw
 the{cooling towers,}which were        
 outside.                              
      Then the scary part came. We all 
 went up in a lift to the top of the   
 building. It was really high and the  
 worst thing about it was that the     
 floor was a grating, so I had to take 
 my shoes off and walk around in bare  
 feet. Thank God I could go home later!</content>
