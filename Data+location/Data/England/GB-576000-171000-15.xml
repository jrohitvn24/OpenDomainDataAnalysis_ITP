		<title>15The Supernatural In Hoo.</title>
		<content> There are also many different         
 superstitions in Hoo. Pupils of Hoo   
 Middle school once believed that their
 school was haunted by a caretaker.This
 was purely superstition.In the        
 graveyard there is a large Yew Tree on
 which are three red marks.Children    
 called these {Devil Marks }and then   
 dance around the tree,saying that     
 they have seen the Devil.             
  Also there are stories that there is 
 a haunted bungalow in{Bells Lane}and a
{Grey Lady.}There is another story     
 about a man who, while digging a grave
 gave a passer-by a shock as he was    
 mistaken to be a ghost.               
{ }Many stories come and go but nobody 
 can tell what the future holds.{ }
