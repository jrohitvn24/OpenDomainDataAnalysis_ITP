		<title>13LETWELL POST OFFICE</title>
		<content>{The post office in Letwell}opens at   
 9 O'clock and closes at half past     
 five.It sometimes closes at noon. Mrs 
 Clark who owns the post office lives  
 at the post office with her family.   
 Mrs Clark has been working at that    
 post office for about five and a half 
 years. She likes working there because
 of all the people she meets.{There are
{two post men who deliver the letters  
{in their post vans. The post man that 
 works at Letwell doesn't live in      
 Letwell he lives in the next village  
 Woodsetts.{There are aproximatly 12   
{letters and 6 customers a day.}The    
 post office only weighs parcels and   
 sells stamps. The post office is quite
 small but Letwell is lucky to have it 
 because it is such a small village.
