		<content> The Coxtie landfill site is almost    
 opposite Peniel Academy in Coxtie     
 Green Road.During the history of      
 tipping at Coxtie there have been     
 several pollutions of the stream      
 which flows thrugh Foxdown wood,      
 providing half of the inflow water to 
 the lakes in the park. This stream    
 rises at a spring under the tip. In   
 order to prevent furthur pollution,   
 which caused serious losses of fish   
 in the early 1970's, this spring is   
 now piped directly into the stream.   
 Drainage water from the tip itself is 
 pumped in to the main sewer for       
 treatment before it is released into  
 rivers. The spring water and inflow to
 the lakes are sampled regularly in    
 order to check the success of this    
 arrangement. Coxtie tip is due for    
 incorporation into the South Weald    
 Country park.                         </content>
