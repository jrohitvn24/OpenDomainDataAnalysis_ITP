		<title>17DEVORAN PLAYING FIELD</title>
		<content>  The playing field at Devoran was pre-
 sented   to   the  village    by   the
 Agar- Robartes family from Lanhydrock.
  It  was given  after the  First World
 War in memory of those  from the vill-
 age who died during the war.          
  It used to  have bamboos  and shrubs,
 also two concrete seats,but one became
 overgrown with brambles.   It was very
 difficult to play football because the
 field sloped so badly.                
  It was not improved because  it would
 cost too much,    but now the Manpower
 Services  are doing  the work  and the
 village just has to pay for the mater-
 ials and the  use of  the diggers  and
 other machinery.                      
  Work began on levelling  the field in
 February 1985.                        
  The  school  is  contributing to  the
 cost because it uses the field most.
