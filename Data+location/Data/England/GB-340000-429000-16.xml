		<title>16HOME LIFE FRECKLETON CHILD</title>
		<content>I've only been living in Freckleton for
two weeks,but I'm quite settled in.At  
school I feel very left behind with the
work.I seem to be struggling to try and
tch up.At my old house(which was in    
Glossop,Derbyshire)The estate that I   
lived on was out in the hills.But in   
Frekleton my new house is right in the 
middle of the village and afew miles   
from the sea.In my old house it was    
about 75miles.I preferred Glossop for  
shops because there were 2             
supermarkets,a toyshop,swimming baths  
and many more shops and services.In    
Freckleton there are only a few shops  
and public services aren't very        
good,but I perfer my new house to all  
my other 4 houses.The houses           
were,Broamway(on the                   
Wirral),Knutsford(Cheshire),Oswestry(Sa
lop)and Glossop(Derbyshire).
