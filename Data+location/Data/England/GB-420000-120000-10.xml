 On Saturday morning I went riding in  
 the New Forest with my family.I       
 managed to get three canters out of   
 Snowy.I was very puffed out so I went 
 in the woods to catch my breath.      
    In the afternoon I went to Lottie's
 house.We played in the wood and found 
 a little den.We made a little front   
 room out of a rhododendron bush.There 
 were bedrooms and everything you have 
 in a real house. We took off our shoes
 and we played in the house.           
   Lottie's Mum drove me home.We played
 in the long grass in my garden.My     
 great auntie has a house in the       
 garden.She is having an extension     
 built.Lottie went home and we had     
 tea.I watched television and ate my   
 three sweets.I read a funny book to   
 Mummy.Daddy read to me before I went  
 to bed.                               </content>
