		<title>09A Typical Small Farm</title>
		<content>     One small farm we visited had cut 
 down on fields because they had       
 finished  dairy farming.  Most of     
 their land is used for grazing.  They 
 also grow some barley and wheat.  Like
 other farmers they now buy calves at  
 one week old,  when really the calves 
 should still be feeding off their     
 mothers.  They do not use artificial  
 fertilizer because they prefer natural
 hay.  It smells nicer and has a green 
 tinge.  They have enough good grazing 
 land for their cows and if they wanted
 they could grow crops there.  They do 
 not make silage because the farm is   
 too small.  On a small farm they do   
 not have to rush, because they do not 
 have as much to do.  Their pace of    
 life seems fairly slow.
