		<title>12SHOPS IN H.GREEN &amp; HAZLEMERE</title>
		<content>Each housing area has its own shopping 
centre.Most of them are food shops.The 
Windmill Estate,Widmer End and Turner's
Place,Holmer Green only have small     
shopping parades.Park Parade,Hazlemere 
has the widest choice of shops         
including a freezer centre,shoe and    
carpet shop.There is a one way service 
road with parking spaces all along it. 
The largest shopping centre is at      
Hazlemere crossroads.This includes     
banks,solicitors and petrol stations.  
The shops are on the main road so      
parking is difficult.All the shopping  
centres are used frequently by local   
people for day to day needs,but most   
shoppers go to High Wycombe for larger 
amounts.There is a farm shop on the    
A404,but there is a threat to close    
this,because it sells fruit and        
vegetables from other places as well as
its own.                               </content>
