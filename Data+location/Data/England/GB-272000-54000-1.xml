		<title>01THEN AND NOW IN DIPTFORD</title>
		<content> History  tells us that in the 185Os   
 there were 75O people who lived in    
 Diptford, and in 1939 the population  
 decreased to 39O.  The{population}was 
 affected by the Great War and also    
 because slate {quarrying} ceased in   
 the area and people moved to the large
 towns.  Fewer people were needed to   
 work on farms therefore there were    
 less jobs available. Then in 1981 it  
 decreased down to 3OO. Now it is      
 thought to go up again because people 
 will like to live in the countryside  
 and commute to work by car using the  
 motorway.1OO years ago there used to  
 be {shops} and five public houses and 
 taverns,blacksmiths and a bakery, but 
 now there is a General Store and Post 
 Office.
