		<content> divided in opinion as to whether      
 badgers cause the spread of bovine    
 tuberculosis and so to some badgers   
 are a dangerous pest which must be    
 exterminated.However,this idea is     
 becoming less popular nowadays.       
 Unfortunately there is quite a lot of 
 illegal killing of animals, mainly    
 badgers and foxes,whose underground   
 dens are dug up or for whom traps are 
 set.Traps in particular are very cruel
 because the animals suffer so;and,of  
 course,they do not discriminate so    
 that domestic pets can also be caught.
 The RSPCA are very concerned about    
 this,but so far they have not managed 
 to catch anyone.
