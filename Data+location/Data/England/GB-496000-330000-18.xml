		<content>    At school they played games like   
 marbles and hopscotch.There was also a
 game where with the cards out off a   
 cigarette packets.They then got into  
 corner and threw about 4 - 5 cards at 
 once.If your card landed on another   
 then you claimed that card.           
   When all the boys got the cane at   
 school they used to rub their hands   
 with onions to stop the stinging from 
 the cane.The only problem is your     
 hands smell of onions for a long time!
     In the village there was a man    
 called "a Carrier" who had a horse and
 a cart and he used to go to the       
 markets at Grantham and fetch things  
 back for the people in Boothby and    
 they would pay him.They used horses   
 for everything.They had nothing       
 mechanical.                           
  His dad used to go to church 3 times 
 on Sunday and chimed 3 bells at once. </content>
