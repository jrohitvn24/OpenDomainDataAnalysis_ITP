		<content>     The area is mostly fields and     
 farmland. At the northwest point is   
 the G.E.C.Marconi Research Laboratory 
 and at the southeast point are the    
 Claydon Farms. Most of the farms are  
 arable,growing corn,rape and a few    
 peas. In May,where the rape has been  
 planted, the fields are a brilliant   
 yellow.                               
     A few of the farms have           
 cattle,both for milk and meat and     
 there are a small number of           
 sheep.there are a few smallholdings.  
 At least two of the farms were        
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Book. The land is flat with the       
 occasional wood and pond. There are a 
 couple of Pill Boxes in the fields    
 left over from the Second World       
 War.
