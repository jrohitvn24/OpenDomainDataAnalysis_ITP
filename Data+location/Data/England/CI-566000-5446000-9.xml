		<title>09Holiday Makers</title>
		<content>  In our area there are lots of{small  
{private hotels}and{guest houses.      
 We thought we would do a survey to    
 find out about{accommodation}used by  
 holiday makers, the length of their   
 holiday, where they lived and why     
 so many of them chose Jersey for their
 holidays.                             
  We prepared a questionnaire which we 
 used to record the answers of fifty   
 holiday makers.  We found that most   
 visitors were staying in small hotels.
 The average length of holiday was one 
 to two weeks.  Most visitors were from
 the Midlands and the south of England.
 They had chosen to come to Jersey for 
 their holidays because they thought   
 that Jersey had a lot of attractions  
 such as better weather than England,  
 good beaches, plenty of nightlife.    
 Everyone we spoke to said that they   
 were enjoying their holidays.         </content>
