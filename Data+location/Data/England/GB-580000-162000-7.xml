     There are many different types of 
 house on  Parkwood  Estate. Some have 
 been  built  recently, but others are 
 about  20  years old. Many people own 
 their own  houses but some rent them. 
 Lately there has been a great deal of 
 building  going on behind our school. 
 Most of these  new  houses  are semi- 
 detached or detached and  people have 
 already moved in. There are  not many 
 blocks of flats on Parkwood, but most 
 people  who  own  shops  usually live 
 above them. My house is semi-detached 
 and across the road from us there are 
 detached houses. In  Sandringham Road 
 the houses are  about five years old. 
 The condition of the houses isn't too 
 bad, but  in  some cases the woodwork 
 is not very well finished.
