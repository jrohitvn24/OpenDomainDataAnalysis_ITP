		<title>16CHURCH GRESLEY</title>
		<content>{The Domesday book}states that William 
 1st gave lands in Staffs and Derbys to
{Sir Nigel de Stafford}who later took  
 the name de Gresley when he made      
 Gresley his chief residence. In 1135  
{William de Gresley}founded a priory of
{Augustinian Canons}in Church Gresley. 
 A castle was also built at Castle     
 Gresley. After dissolution in 1540    
 the priory lands were sold changing   
 hands many times until 1828 when      
{Gresley Hall}was built on the site    
 of the old priory.The{Parish Church of
{S.S.George and Mary}was appropriated  
 to the priory at an early date and    
 formed part of the monastic buildings.
 On dissolution the chancel was pulled 
 down.In 1786 the church was partially 
 restored,&amp; in 1872 a new chancel was  
 buillt.The church today consists of   
 chancel,nave &amp; N.aisle, with an       
 embattled tower at the E.end.         </content>
