		<title>03NEAR HAGLEY PARK</title>
		<content> On our Domesday project walk, we went 
 to the Clent Hills near Birmimgham.   
 The only man made features were a few 
 houses,the A456,the obelisk which was 
 a landmark built in the 19th Century  
 and also a ruin of Hagley Castle. Most
 of the rest was woodland and farmland.
 The farmland was used for crops and   
 rough grazing, although we didn't see 
 many animals. The crops were mostly   
 wheat and barley. The woodland was    
 coniferous and mixed forest. We walked
 to the{obelisk.}There is a local story
 here about{Bella in the Wychelm. }    
 Bella was a young girl who was killed 
 and she was stuffed into a hollow     
 wychelm. There is still a mystery     
 about who killed her. She was killed  
 because people believed she was a     
 witch. All this happened in the early 
 19th century.                         
                                       </content>
