		<title>09Southern Nazeing 3: Wildlife</title>
		<content> The lakes also attract a tremendous   
 variety of wildlife. On our excursions
 a number of birds could be identified,
 eg Moorhens, Cootes, Swans, Herons,   
 Swallows, Wagtails to name but a few. 
 During the summer months a whole      
 variety of insects can be observed and
 surely none more beautiful than the   
 Damson Fly performing its aquatic     
 dance over the river.                 
 This part of the area is one which has
 tremendous potential as a leisure     
 facility - what we are witnessing at  
 present is the 'infant' stage. One    
 feature that does rather scar the     
 landscape are the overhead            
 transmission lines that come from the 
 power station in Hoddesden and "march"
 across the countryside carrying the   
 much needed electricity to the Urban  
 and industrial areas surrounding      
 Nazeing.                              </content>
