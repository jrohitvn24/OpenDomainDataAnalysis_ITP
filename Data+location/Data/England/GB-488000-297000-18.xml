		<content>    This is a friendly, warm-hearted   
 pub, serving not only villagers, but  
 also people from Leicester, Kettering 
 and Corby on a regular basis. The     
 landlord, Mrs Muriel Perkins estimates
 that 90% of her customers come from   
 outside the village. The pub seats 45 
 people, and 50% of the customers have 
 food as well as drinks.               
                                       
    Years ago the publican cooked meat 
 for the villagers, and because salt   
 was used to preserve the meat, there  
 is still a lot of salt left in the    
 walls of the pub  where the ovens used
 to be. It is yhought that there is a  
 well under the floorboards.
