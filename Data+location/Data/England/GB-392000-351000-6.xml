		<title>06Bulk Milk Collection.</title>
		<content>    In 1964 Mr.D.Weaver bought a farm  
in Park Lane,Endon.The previous owner  
possessed five lorries which he used to
collect milk from local farms and send 
it to the dairy.Now Mr.Weaver has      
nineteen milk tankers.The milk is taken
from a radius of fifty kilometres for  
the Milk Marketing Board who in turn   
sell it to the dairy.The Board pay Mr. 
Weaver haulage fees.Half the milk is   
used for liquid milk consumption,some  
for cheese,butter and yoghurt making   
and the rest for powdered milk.Each    
week Mr.Weaver sends milk samples from 
every farm visited to the Board to     
check for traces of antibiotic.If any  
are present in the milk it can't be    
sold because it spoils the starter for 
cheese making.In the tanker the milk is
kept at a constant temperature of under
five degrees centigrade in order to    
prevent the growth of bacteria.        </content>
