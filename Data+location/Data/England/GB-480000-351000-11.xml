		<content>    My Dad wanted to be a machine      
 operator, but later decided that he   
 would prefer to be a fitter and served
 his apprenticeship with Worthington   
 Simpsons Ltd. They were founded in the
 1880's and make all types of pumps    
 from central heating size to one which
 will be used for emptying dry docks in
 Korea.                                
   My Dad's job is in prototype and    
 development test work.He tests all the
 new products and improvements to      
 existing products. He works in a small
 department with a fitter and sometimes
 an apprentice. He is given a fairly   
 free hand at work and likes the       
 variety of jobs he gets, and also the 
 opportunity of meeting people who come
 in from outside with new ideas.       
   He travels to work on a pushbike    
 because we live fairly close to the   
 factory.                              </content>
