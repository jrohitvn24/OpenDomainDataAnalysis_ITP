		<title>10SHEEPSCOMBE CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content> Sheepscombe Cricket Club plays high on
 a hill. It is quite popular. The      
 cricketers are local, but few live in 
 Sheepscombe.The ypungest player is    
 14and some men play until they are    
 about 50.mostly the team draws but    
 rarely loses.To reach the field you   
 climb a steep path. The pitch is      
 uneven,sloping down to a very grassy  
 boundary.The wooden pavilion looks    
 down on the pitch. If you hit the ball
 uphillprobably you would not score 4  
 runs. If you hit the ball downhill it 
 is easier to get a 4. One fielder is  
 so low down the bank he cannot see the
 wicket so he might not see the ball   
 coming until it is too late. If you   
 hit the ball into the grass you may   
 never find it. The pitch faces South  
 and looks on to a beautiful view of   
 Sheepscombe and beyond that Painswick.
