		<title>11SHREWTON STEAM LAUNDRY</title>
		<content> The only small industry within this   
 area is the Shrewton Steam Laundry.   
 The original premises were used by a  
 brewery, and although some of the     
 original features were retained, the  
 building was converted in 1917 for use
 as a Laundry.                         
 Today business contracts are negoti-  
 ated with the military camps on Salis-
 bury Plain such as Larkhill, Bulford  
 Camp, Tidworth Garrison, Boscombe Down
 and Warminster for the cleaning and   
 pressing of dress uniforms, working   
 overalls, plus linen and bedding used 
 by the various messes in the area.    
 Shrewton people make good use of the  
 services offered by the Laundry, which
 has a very good reputation in the     
 area.                                 
 Mr. J Hall is the present owner and he
 employs 24 people including office and
 delivery staff.                       </content>
