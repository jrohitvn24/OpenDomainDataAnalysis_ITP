		<content> One of the many changes in our area   
 since 1945 has been housing. Before   
 then most dwellings were cottages, but
 now there is a mixture of cottages,   
 bungalows, council houses and private 
 houses. The new buildings replaced the
 old unsafe cottages.                  
 The population has changed too, 50    
 years ago it was roughly 300 now it is
 375. Another thing that has increased 
 is the attendence in Langford Parish  
 Church. There have been changes in the
 landscape too, one change has been in 
 fields being made into bigger ones by 
 taking down hedges. Elm trees have    
 been chopped down because of Dutch Elm
 disease.                              
 Another change is in the closing of   
 schools, there used to be four schools
 in the  area and now there is only one
 which is Langford Budville Primary    
 School.                               </content>
