		<title>03CRANHAM FEAST</title>
		<content>     Cranham Feast started in the 1700s
 then it stopped in the 1880s restarted
 again in 1908 then because of the wars
 it stopped then in 1951 it started and
 has been going ever since.            
 They have a deer roasting on a spit   
 and you pay so much for a roll.       
 There's a mime written by Ralph Reader
 in 1952 when the squire comes out to  
 meet his villagers in old fashioned   
 clothes. Then there's a parade of     
 hounds and horses when they come into 
 the ring and the children go and see  
 them. There's a tug of war, after that
 there's a boundary race when the men  
 and women run part of the way round   
 Cranham. In the morning there's a     
 flower display at the church.In the   
 afternoon there's a parade across the 
 common. At the feast there is a fun   
 fair.This year it's held on the 12th  
 of August.   BY MATTHEW CHARMAN(age 7)</content>
