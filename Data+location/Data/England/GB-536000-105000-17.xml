 During the summer the Community Centre
 is used by foreign students as a study
 base.They come to Brighton for 2 or 3 
 weeks to learn English whilst on      
 holiday.Many of them live with host   
 families in Woodingdean.The Community 
 Centre is on a site which includes a  
 school,library,youth club and swimming
 pool.This enables services to be used 
 at the same time.A mother can go to   
 keep fit class at the centre whilst   
 her children are at school.The        
 children can go swimming when she is  
 at the library or a coffee morning at 
 the centre.There are family events at 
 the centre such as discos or          
 barbecues.On the opposite side of the 
 road there is a parade of shops and   
 there is free car parking.
