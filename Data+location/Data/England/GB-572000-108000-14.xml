		<title>14ST PETER'S CENTRE, OLD TOWN</title>
		<content>    Children from St. Mary Magdalene's 
 School interviewed the warden, Mrs.   
 Mitten, who told us that the{three    
{halls}were in constant use by{young   
{and old.}More{retired people}used them
 than others, but there was a{Mother   
{and Toddler group}on a Friday morning.
{Church groups}used them for youth     
 activities, parties and after church  
 coffee times.{Adult Education}used it 
 for art and dancing classes, whilst   
 during the summer months it was       
 extensively used for{English language 
{classes for foreign students.         
    The halls could be hired for       
 private functions and meals could be  
 prepared. Mrs. Mitten thought it was  
 an important part of general community
 life here. Other centres are at{Sidley
 and{Pebsham. The Stables}block next to
 the centre has recently been converted
 into rooms especially for church use. </content>
