		<title>17Activities of Adults &amp; Kids</title>
		<content>35% of parents listed sports as their  
most important spare time activity,    
with most popular being badminton,     
swimming, golf, and football. This     
trend was also reflected by the older  
children in our school, as about 45%   
of 9 to 11 year olds said they played  
badminton or football or went swimming 
regularly. Most children or adults play
badminton or go swimming at the        
Westcroft Leisure Centre in Carshalton.
All the 9 to 11 year old boys play     
football at school but many of them    
and some 8 year olds also play in the  
local mini league clubs that meet on   
Saturday mornings.All the 5 to 7 year  
olds spent alot of their spare time    
watching television. The older did not 
spend as much time watching television,
and only 5% of parents listed watching 
TV as a spare time activity.
