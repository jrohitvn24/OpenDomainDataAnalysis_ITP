		<title>12HOUSING IN KNUTSFORD</title>
		<content>   The style of houses is very varied  
 in Knutsford.  People tend to prefer  
 old fashioned property to modern      
 property.                             
   Prices range from about Â£20,000     
 to Â£50,000 for an average sized house.
 For a terraced house,like Middle Walk 
 and Moordale Road, the price would be 
 around Â£20,000 but some terraced      
 houses could range up to Â£40,000.     
  For a semi-detached house the price  
 is very varied. Detached houses are   
 most common in Knutsford. Prices range
 from Â£30,000 - Â£60,000. There are not 
 many bungalows in Knutsford and as    
 they are of different sizes it is     
 difficult to tell what the price range
 is. As you can see houses range not   
 only in price but in size and style as
 well.
