		<content> In the area in which we live,the old  
 cottages are gradually being bought up
 by retired people, or used as weekend 
 retreats by people from towns. The    
 prices of these houses are much more  
 than the local people can afford. The 
 young people are forced to move away  
 to find work. The child population is 
 falling and if this continues the     
 future of the school, in the long     
 term, is doubtful. The village of Oare
 is class 'C' for planning purposes,   
 which means there can be no new       
 building except for infilling, and no 
 new building is allowed in the        
 countryside. We do not want to spoil  
 our village, but we think some limited
 building should be allowed to provide 
 houses to encourage younger people to 
 stay.
