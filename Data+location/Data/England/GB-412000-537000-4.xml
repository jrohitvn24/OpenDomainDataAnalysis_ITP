		<title>04ST.PHILIP &amp; ST.JAMES CHURCH.</title>
		<content>{ The parish church of St.Philip &amp;     
{St.James, Tow Law, was completed in   
{1868}though the spire was added later.
  The church costs, (Â£1892 8s 3d), were
 met by the parishioners.              
{ The unusual choir screen (made up of 
{hundreds of pine cones, acorns and    
{conkers stuck on a wooden framework)  
{is unique in England. It was made by  
{Rev. Espin and helpers in the 1890's. 
  The carved wooden choir surround was 
 built as a war memorial.              
  The font, at the back of the church, 
 also has a carved wooden cover. The   
 basin is made of lead.                
  The lectern is made of solid brass in
 the shape of a winged eagle.          
  Hanging on the walls are the some of 
 the paintings that Rev. Espin brought 
 back from his travels.                
  The stained glass windows date from  
 1882 to 1984.                         </content>
