		<title>04Home Farm, Littleton</title>
		<content> In the centre of Littleton village is 
 Home Farm which occupies a site of    
 about thirty acres.The farm house is  
 two hundred years old.Some of the land
 is used for growing crops which       
 include :turnips,kail,rape  and       
 grass.There are also a number of      
 animals on the farm:100 beef cattle,65
 cows and about 100 sheep and chickens 
 and hens.Most of the cattle are       
 slaughtered but some of the cows and  
 sheep are sold;along with milk to a   
 local dairy.There are 3 tractors,2    
 mowing machines,a hay turner and a hay
 bailer on the farm.The owners like    
 living in Littleton although they said
 a car was essential because of the    
 relative isolation of the village.
