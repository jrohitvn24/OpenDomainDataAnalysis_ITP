		<content> This 86 acre farm is situated along   
 the main road leading into the village
 of Thorner.                           
 There are between 20 and 30 acres used
 as arable land. Barley, oats and      
 potatoes are grown. There are thirty  
 two dairy cows, 30 "fallowers", 10    
 cats and a sheepdog!                  
 The farm has three tractors, harrows  
 and ploughs.                          
                                       
 The farmer eats some of the food he   
 produces. Milk is sold to the         
 Marketing Board, and potatoes are sold
 from house to house.                  
                                       
 The farmer believes that the farm will
 eventually be replaced by housing.
