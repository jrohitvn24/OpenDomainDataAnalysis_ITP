		<content>{ON THE 9th JANUARY 1646 THERE WAS A   
{BATTLE BETWEEN PARLIAMENTARY AND      
{ROYALIST TROOPS THE SITE OF THE BATTLE
{IS NOW INDICATED BY A CROSS ON BOVEY  
{HEATH (823767)}                       
 Oliver Cromwell started a Battle      
 Between the Royalist and Roundheads   
 Many a soldier found his death bed    
 The screams were horrific             
 The villagers in their fright         
 Turned and ran away into the winters  
 night                                 
 The horses and men that lay on the    
 ground                                
 Many a friend was not to be found     
 The sound of the cannon               
 Made a tremendous boom                
 And made certain death                
 To many who were doomed               
 A cross is all that is left           
 To remind us where many a soldier     
 Met his death.                        </content>
