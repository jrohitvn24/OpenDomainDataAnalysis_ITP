 The block is mainly agricultural land 
 but includes part of North Walsham and
 Witton and Bacton Woods, a mainly     
 coniferous plantation.  The land,     
 contrary to rumour,is not fat but     
 undulates gently. The soil is         
 particularly rich and suitable for    
 growing most crops,particularly sugar 
 beet,cereal,fruit and vegetable crops 
 are also prominent. North Walsham     
 itself is the market town for a       
 considerable are and is increasing in 
 size with several new housing         
 developments and,although not in this 
 block a thriving light industrial     
 estate which provides work for many of
 the residents of the block,although   
 agriculture is the predominant        
 influence. Most of the people have    
 lived here or herebouts all their     
 lives but they welcome newcomers      </content>
