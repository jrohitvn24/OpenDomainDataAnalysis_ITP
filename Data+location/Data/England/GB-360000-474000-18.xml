		<content> Alarm wakes us at 6.10,a signal for   
 Peter to get up and milk the cows. I  
 get up at 7 and the children leave for
 school in the taxi at 8.30. Peter     
 returns for breakfast at 9.00.I wash  
 up,do two loads of washing and hang it
 out,feed the cats,and clean up. After 
 coffee I go into Kendal for groceries.
 The children are staying late at      
 school for evening activities so I    
 need to pick them up at 4.30. Just    
 about to set off for school when the  
 fish man arrives and I get some plaice
 for supper. Return home,put shopping  
 away,get washing in, get Edward ready 
 for cubs and take him with friends to 
 Ingleton. Return home, make supper and
 dash out to flower arranging demon-   
 stration at W.I. I pass Peter on the  
 doorstep. Arrive home at 10.00 after  
 calling on a villager about Parish    
 Council business.In bed by 11.30.     </content>
