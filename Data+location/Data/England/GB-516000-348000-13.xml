		<content>  Regarding furniture, the self-       
 assembly type is at present very      
 popular, being reasonably priced.     
  Three piece suites usually form the  
 basis of the living room (lounge).    
 Most families have fitted carpets.    
  Fitted kitchens, with labour saving  
 devices are typical eg.automatic wash-
 ing machines, tumble driers, food     
 processors. Microwave ovens are also  
 putting in an appearance.             
  A lot of families own or rent colour 
 televisions, and several homes possess
 more than one. Children watch much    
 more television these days.           
  Most households do some painting and 
 decorating; do-it-yourself being not  
 only money saving but also a hobby.   
  Dogs and cats are the usual choice   
 for pets, though a few people have    
 other animals eg. goats(for milk),    
 rabbits, rats!, budgies, fish etc.    </content>
