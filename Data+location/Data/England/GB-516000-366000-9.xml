		<title>09BUCKNALL SCHOOL - SCHEMES</title>
		<content> The{English}scheme is about nine years
 old but the books themselves are only 
 three years old. {Sports}equipment is 
 excellent and we try but sometimes    
 fail to keep it in that condition.  Mr
 Kirk is not stingey with the equipment
 and most playtimes lets us have some  
 out as long as we ask him nicely and  
 as long as long as we're in his good  
 books!  The{spelling}scheme is one of 
 the best schemes in Britain and is    
 only 2 years old.  It is called       
 Spelling Workshop and has different   
 cards that are fairly hard and get    
 harder the further you go on. Our     
{reading scheme}is wonderful as our    
 teacher keeps reminding us.  It has 15
 levels and about 64 books in each     
 level. Our{library}contains roughly   
 1400 factual books ranging from       
 animals and birds and armoured cars to
 tanks.                                </content>
