		<title>12RAMBLER'S ASSOCIATION</title>
		<content> At a meeting in Heathfield            
 Comprehensive School in 1977 attended 
 by many interested people it was      
 decided to see if there was sufficient
 support for a Rambler's Association to
 be established.A public meeting was   
 then held. This attracted 200 people  
 and the Wealden Cuckoos Ramblers'     
 Association was formed.They chose this
 name because the association was to be
 based in Heathfield and it is here    
 that a legend says "The first cuckoo  
 was let out of a basket by an old     
 woman on April 14th" The Wealden      
 Cuckoos are responsible for the       
 maintenance of footpaths within a 10  
 mile radius of Heathfield. They       
 also,with the support of Parish       
 Councils,rebuild stiles,build bridges 
 and clear paths.The group is          
 especially concerned with the Cuckoo  
 Line, a disused railway line.         </content>
