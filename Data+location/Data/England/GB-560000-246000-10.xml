  the first to rent it.In 1800 he was  
 the first of the family to own it.

 does not sell from the door, but he   
 used to sell dairy products, butter,  
 milk etc. He owns 4 four wheel drive  
 tractors, 1 combine_ harvester, 1 seed
 drill, 1 plough &amp; 2 sprayers.The      
 sprays he uses are 31B, W4 and 01.He  
 sells malting barley for beer and     
 whisky.He grows very little corn.15   
 bullocks graze in spring.5 men work

 beside the road.The farm has been     
 farmed for 200 years.The crops are    
 barley, wheat,rape and beans. He
