		<title>15RECREATION -BREAKDANCING</title>
		<content>  Breakdancing is where people go on   
 the floor and do a{funny dance by     
{waving their arms and legs in the air.
 It is practised by a lot of boys and  
 some girls. It originated in New York 
 in 1969. Breakdancers wear{special    
{clothing}and quite often they also    
 wear gloves. If they dance in the     
 street then they{use a square of lino,
 which is polished, to help them move  
 and spin on their backs, arms &amp; legs. 
  Breakdancing has also a{special      
{language and music.}The music played  
 is fast and has a predominant beat.   
 Breakdancers carry Ghettoblasters     
 which are cassette players with a high
 output.                               
  Breakdancing is really a{combination 
{of spins and movements.}Each dancer   
 tries to be better than anyone else   
 and shows off. When someone is dancing
 everyone crowds round to watch.       </content>
