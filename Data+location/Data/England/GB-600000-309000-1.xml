		<title>01The Yaxham Area</title>
		<content> The area including the parishes of    
 Yaxham &amp; Whimburgh is devoted mainly  
 to agriculture. Here and there are    
 groups of trees,coverts and small     
 ponds, but most of the land is        
 cultivated. Settlements are mainly    
 centred on the villages of Yaxham &amp;   
 Whimburgh &amp; the hamlet of Clint Green.
 The area has limited local services   
 &amp; facilities apart from a thriving    
 village school at Clint Green which   
 serves primary aged children from the 
 whole area.The River Tud flows east   
 across the area passing through damp  
 meadow land.To the north the land     
 rises towards the main A47 road       
 connecting the Midlands and West      
 Norfolk with Norwich and the East     
 Anglian ports.
