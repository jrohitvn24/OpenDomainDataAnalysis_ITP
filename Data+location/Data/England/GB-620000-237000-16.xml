		<title>16FARMING IN NACTON</title>
		<content> The estate owns 2,300 acres but only  
1,255 acres are arable. Four hundred   
acres are mixed, deciduous, natural    
woodland. A little land is contracted  
out for sheep grazing. There are 40    
deer on which are not culled. One man  
is in charge of the arable section of  
the estate. The soil is light and sandy
and soil erosion has been controlled by
high hedges and trees acting as wind   
breaks. Barley,wheat, duram wheat,rye  
and triticale are grown. There are only
four workers on the farm who work long 
hours six days a week. On Sunday one   
man will check the irrigators morning  
and night. At harvest time, the men    
usually work from 7.00 a.m. to 5.00p.m.
The estate has one main tractor of one 
hundred horse-power and four smaller   
tractors. It is a very highly          
mechanised farm.
