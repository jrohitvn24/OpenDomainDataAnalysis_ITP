		<content>{Broadway}is famous for the honey-     
 coloured stone cottages and fine      
 gabled houses which line the main     
 street. The walls, roofing, paving,   
 window mullions and chimneys are all  
 of locally quarried{Cotswold stone.   
 The finer houses are built of         
 carefully cut blocks known as{'ashlar'
 The cottages are built of smaller     
 stone called{'rubble'.}The walls are  
 thick and the roofs steep and gabled. 
 The gables are topped by carved       
 finials. The windows have stone       
 mullions and leaded lights. Some      
 houses have ornamental chimneys, stone
 tiled roofs and drip moulds above the 
 windows. The{Broadway Hotel,}at the   
 bottom of the village near the village
 green, is timber framed with half-    
 stone work.{Broadway}properties are   
 very much sought after and prices are 
 high.                                 </content>
