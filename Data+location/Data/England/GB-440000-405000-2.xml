		<title>02A Typical Morning at School</title>
		<content> My day usually begins at{7.00am,}when 
 either my mum or the alarm wakes me.  
 I lie in bed for about 10 mins then I 
 go downstairs for my breakfast.I      
 usually have cereal.After my breakfast
 I go into the bathroom to get washed  
 and brush my teeth,then I go upstairs 
 into my bedroom to get dressed.I watch
{TV.am Breakfast Show.}My transport to 
 Great Houghton J.&amp; I.School is a{car  
 driven by my dad.When the bell goes we
 do "7 a Day"maths.We then continue    
 with{"Fletcher Maths".}At about 9.10  
 we go into the main hall for an       
 assembly with Mr.Moulder,the{local    
{curate}who comes in on Wednesdays to  
 show us pictures and to tell us{Bible 
{Stories.}The morning break lasts for  
 15 mins.When we come in from playtime 
 we continue with our work until lunch.
 I have sandwiches,biscuits and pop but
 most children have{school dinner.}    </content>
