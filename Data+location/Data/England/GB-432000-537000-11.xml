		<title>11THE GAMES WE PLAY</title>
		<content> These are some of the games we play   
 when we play out.                     
 KICKY THE CAN:First we have to find a 
 can.Then everybody gets 20 off.Whoever
 is on catches the others and they hide
 round the garages.They stand over the 
 can until sombody kicks it.           
 POLO:Whoever is on picks a subject    
 like cars and shouts out names like   
 Rover or Princess.The person who has  
 whispered that name has to run back   
 and forth.                            
 AUNTIES &amp; UNCLES:Three or four        
 play,one says "Aunty Mary"if you have 
 an Aunty Mary you take one step,if you
 have three you take three steps!      
 FOX &amp; HOUNDS:To play you need a bike  
 and some chalk,then you make arrows   
 all over the paths.People have to     
 follow the arrows.
