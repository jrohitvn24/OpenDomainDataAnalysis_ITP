		<content> The survey area is an attractive      
 land of partly wooded hills and       
 valleys crossed by narrow lanes       
 bordered by tall hedges. The River    
 Asker flows west towards Bridport in  
 the southern part of the area, and the
 Mangerton River flows south near the  
 western boundary. The Asker joins the 
 Brit which flows to the sea at West   
 Bay. The area is predominantly        
 farmland with scattered clusters of   
 houses. The picturesque village of    
 Loders contains many old thatched     
 cottages and some new building. In    
 recent years the traditional farming  
 population has declined and many      
 houses have become holiday cottages,  
 retirement homes and homes for        
 business and professional people      
 commuting to Dorchester and Weymouth.
