		<content>   The area of our survey is           
 particularly interesting because it   
 includes the village of Old Woking and
 the railway station which precipitated
 the development of 'New Woking' in the
 19th century.                         
   The area includes two features of   
 modern town development:The Leisure   
 Centre opened in 1976 is situated in  
 Woking Park and Woking Six Form       
 College in Rydens Way.                
   The north western section of our    
 area which includes the town centre is
 both residential and commercial.      
 In Old Woking there is some light     
 industry along the High Street with   
 Unwin the printers beside the river   
 Wey. The eastern parts of our area are
 rural. There are several farms, a new 
 golf course, the sewage works and sand
 quarries.Running through the area is  
 the Bourne stream and the river Wey.  </content>
