		<title>14Children's Activities</title>
		<content> Children's hobbies are many and       
 include, BMX, Fishing,and Judo.       
 Quite a lot of children take advantage
 of the facilities offered at the      
 Leisurte Centre in Boroughbridge.     
 Many of the girls belong to the Guides
 and Brownies. the boys have a similar 
 organisation called the Boy Scouts.   
 I go to Brownies on Monday night. we  
 have three groups called Footpath,    
 Roadway and Highway. I am in Highway  
 where we work for badges like the     
 Friendship badge. We also play games  
 like'May I'. You play it like this,   
 someone is on, they must call out     
 someone else, who must then do what   
 the person who is on says. We aslo    
 collect silver paper, stamps and kit  
 kt wrappers for a guide dog for the   
 blind. I like to knit and i am        
 knitting some squares for the drought 
 victims in Ethiopia.                  </content>
