		<content> A very prominent physical feature     
 within our area is a large deciduous  
 wood called{Cragwood}.This wood is    
 situated near the villages of Evenwood
 and Ramshaw and it is on the northern 
 slope of land leading to the valley or
 the River Gaunless.There are footpaths
 leading from the villages to the woods
 and often people go for walks there   
 and children go to play.Apart from the
 trees and wildlife to be found in the 
 woods there are also 2 ponds and 2    
 disused quarries within its           
 boundaries.There also used to be a tip
 there but it has been disused for many
 years and is now grassed over.The     
 local schools often visit the woods as
 part of their projects.Sometimes they 
 tape bird songs but usually they      
 collect leaves and fruit and do bark  
 rubbings or identify the wild flowers 
 growing there.                        </content>
