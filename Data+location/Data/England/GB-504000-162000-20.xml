		<content> but that's not all! The bad news for  
 the morning is the newscaster         
 announces there is an accident at     
 junction 4 on the A3 along with a 100 
 yard pile up: the traffic is bound to 
 be bad.You come to the end of your    
 road and turn right.                  
   You pull out and put your foot down;
 25,30,40,50,60 m.p.h. Oh no,the round-
 about! You slow down just as you were 
 getting up speed.                     
    You carry straight to road junction
 2. You rev up: 40,50,60 m.p.h. You    
 carry on peacefully and you've caught 
 up with time.Phew, that was close!    
    You pass junction 3 you soon see   
 the blue lights up ahead you gradually
 slow down and you grind to a halt.    
    You sit in the traffic jam and then
 an hour after this you're in the city 
 and outside the office.{
