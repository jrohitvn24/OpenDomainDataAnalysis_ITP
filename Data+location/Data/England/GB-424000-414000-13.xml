   Both Netherton and Flockton suffer a
 lack of shops compared to their recent
 past. This is because of the growth of
 supermarkets in other areas, together 
 with the ease of transport via private
 cars to larger centres of trade i.e.  
 Wakefield, Huddesfield, Barnsley and  
 Leeds. Small shops cannot make a      
 reasonable living for their owners as 
 they are generally only used as       
 stop-gaps for forgotten items, and    
 therefore there has been a marked     
 decline in grocery type stores. Each  
 village has a Post Office which also  
 sells some food items together with   
 newspapers, cigarettes, sweets etc.   
 But there are literally only one or   
 two other shops in either village.    
   Netherton has recently aquired a one
 stall open market type amenity which  
 is a green grocery stall 3 days a week</content>
