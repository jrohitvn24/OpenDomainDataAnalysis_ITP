		<content> We had an interview with the Challney 
 Schools{Education Welfare Officer.}   
 This is what she told us:             
 She deals with boys who stay at home  
 too much eg.{truants.}She also deals  
 with boys' personal problems which    
 they are afraid to tell their parents.
 She interviews parents over school    
 matters if there is felt to be a      
 special problem. Miss Cockerill finds 
 new schools for boys who are expelled 
 or suspended too often. She deals with
 boys who are in trouble with the      
 police. She asks the police what they 
 have done wrong. She also visits      
 junior schools once a fortnight to    
 deal with the problems of children    
 there. Another aspect of her work is  
 to deal with families in need of      
 financial help, this includes free    
 dinners . Miss Cockerill says that she
 likes working at Challney.            </content>
