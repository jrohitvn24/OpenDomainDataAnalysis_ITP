		<title>08The Butterfly farm</title>
		<content>   We went to the Butterfly Farm in the
 parish of St.Mary's. The Butterfly    
 Farm was opened 6 years ago. They get 
 around 800 visitors a day, 99% are    
 tourists and 1% are locals. The       
 biggest butterfly that they've got is 
 the Owl Butterfly which has a wing    
 span of 8 inches. The rarest butterfly
 is the large tortoiseshell which is a 
 British butterfly which is nearly     
 extinct because it fed on elm trees   
 and because of Dutch elm disease many 
 of them have died. The average        
 temperature is 80 degrees farenheit.  
 The difference between butterflies and
 moths is that butterflies antennae are
 long and slender with clubbed ends,   
 moths antennae are tapered at the end 
 or feathered. The farm has bred Comet 
 Moths, the largest moth in the world. 
 It has never been bred in captivity   
 before.                               </content>
