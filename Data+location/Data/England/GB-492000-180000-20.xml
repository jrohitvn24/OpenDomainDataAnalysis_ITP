		<title>20AN OLD MAN'S VIEW</title>
		<content> Mr Murrel has lived in Cippenham for  
 50 years.In his younger days it was a 
 village.Recently he has noticed a rise
 in house building and the population. 
 Small grocery stores have vanished.   
 The Herald Snooker Club on the Bath   
 Road was a Cinema and Dance Hall -The 
 Commodore. The development of houses  
 was mainly due to Mr.Iona who built   
 many houses by extending St.Andrew's  
 Way.Prices have changed a lot in the  
 last 40 years..In the late 1940's a   
 newspaper cost 1d (1/2p) Petrol cost  
 3s 6d under 20p a gallon.Bus fares    
 from Cippenham to Slough cost 6d (2p) 
 In 1960 fish and chips cost 1s 9d(10p)
 The Trading Estate, the largest in    
 Europe,helps Slough with unemployment 
 and people live in Cippenham to work  
 on the Trading Estate.Mr Murrel feels 
 that all that is left of the old      
 Cippenham is round the Village Green. </content>
