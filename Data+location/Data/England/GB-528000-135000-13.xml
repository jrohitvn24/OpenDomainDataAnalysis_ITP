		<content> Furnace Green (C1) is a neighbourhood 
 of Crawley. It gained it's name from  
 the fact that a charcoal iron furnace 
 was worked in that area -Tilgate      
 Furnace. The furnace itself was sited 
 in the area of Laurel Close. Many of  
 the original owners of the houses     
 recently built there have found pieces
 of slag, silica and impure iron       
 remains of the iron ore and lemestone 
 smelted there. Neatby in Long Wood    
 there are still the remains of the    
 charcoal burners - a lot of charcoal  
 is lying about. Alongside the wood    
 traces of the river, which was        
 diverted to provide power for the iron
 workings, are still to be found. Many 
 of the street names in Furnace Green  
 have connections withe the iron       
 workings - Furnace Drive, Furnace     
 Parade and Furnace Farm Road among    
 them. The pub is the Charcoal Burner. </content>
