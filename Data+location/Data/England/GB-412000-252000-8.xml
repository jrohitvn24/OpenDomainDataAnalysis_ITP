		<title>08THE LANDSCAPE OF GRAFTON</title>
		<content> This is a country area, the southern  
 part of which includes the Avon valley
 where the river makes a large meander 
 around flat land.  To the north of the
 meander the land starts to rise.  By  
 the river the ground is 35m above sea 
 level and it rises to 98m above sea   
 level near Temple Grafton. On the     
 slope of these hills are three mixed  
 woodlands.  A small stream rises in   
 Temple Grafton and flows to join the  
 river Avon at Hillborough.  Along the 
 stream there are a few ponds close to 
 Grafton Court.  There is a beautiful  
 view to the south from Temple Grafton 
 of the Cotswold Hills.  At the        
 beginning of this century the area was
 noted for its good orchards and many  
 of them are still here.There is an old
 quarry in Temple Grafton, and another 
 in Binton.  Stone from these quarries 
 was used for building locally.        </content>
