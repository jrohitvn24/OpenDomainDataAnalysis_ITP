		<title>04FARMING AROUND CALOW</title>
		<content> Calow area is surrounded by farmland. 
 Most of the land has crops that are   
 not grassland,like wheat,barley,oats  
 and oilseed rape. There is some       
 grassland which is used for pasture   
 for beef cattle,like Herefords,       
 Simmentals,Charolais,for some Friesian
 dairy cows and a few sheep and horses.
 Some of this grass is cut for silage  
 and hay to feed the cattle in the     
 winter.                               
 On the farms there are small groups of
 trees and these are mainly deciduous. 
 A small piece of land near Arkwright  
 is used for allotments by the miners  
 growing vegetables,fruit and flowers  
 for their families.One or two people  
 keep pigeons too.
