This page is based on an interview with
one of the local policemen.            
The police force is made up of men     
and women who help to  keep peace in   
our country.They are employed by the   
Council.The police patrol the village  
by foot and by car to talk to local    
people and  to help newcomers to the   
village.                               
'O' level exam passes are needed to    
enter the police force so a policeman  
has to be quite clever.Every  policeman
has his own identification number,the  
uniform is blue and  it has to be worn 
on duty. The police are only allowed   
to use a weapon if vitally necessary.  
Two policemen based in the neighbouring
village Long Buckby act as community   
policemen.                             
The police take a cycling proficiency  
course at  the school each summer.     </content>
