		<content>    Fernden is a preparatory school for
 about 130 boys with accommodation for 
 95 boarders. The school was founded in
 1907 by Mr Norman Brownrigg who in    
 1935 was succeeded as headmaster by   
 his son Mr Charles Brownrigg. Current 
 headmaster is Mr F.G. Skipwith. It is 
 likely to close for financial reasons.
    The school stands just outside     
 Haslemere in its own 75 acre estate   
 some 600 feet above sea level.The main
 building was originally a large       
 19-century country house containig    
 living accommodation for the boarders,
 the headmaster and his family, and the
 matrons. It includes the large modern 
 dining_room and kitchens, constructed 
 during 1974 and 1975; also the main   
 classrooms, the gymnasium, the stage  
 and the school chapel. In the same    
 area are the science laboratory and a 
 new art block.                        </content>
