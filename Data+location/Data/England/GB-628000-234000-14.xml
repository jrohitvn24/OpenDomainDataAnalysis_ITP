		<title>14The Elderly In Felixstowe</title>
		<content>    In Old Felixstowe there is a       
 development of{Sheltered Housing}in   
 Gosford Way. Thirty six people live   
 here. It is owned and run by the      
 Council. The elderly who live here are
 single and cater for themselves. They 
 have the security of knowing that by  
 ringing an alarm bell, someone will   
 come to help them. The warden is      
 fairly young and able to cope with    
 all their needs.                      
    Also there are many{private        
{residential homes}for the elderly in  
 Felixstowe. The sea air is bracing and
 there are many large Victorian houses 
 which provide suitable accommodation. 
 A typical home is the Foxgrove in Old 
 Felixstowe. Twenty three people live  
 here and the oldest is ninety five.  A
 room with a bath costs Â£145 per week.
