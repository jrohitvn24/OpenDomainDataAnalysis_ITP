		<title>01THE SOUTHERN WAVENEY VALLEY</title>
		<content> The block, which straddles the Beccles
 to Bungay road, lies chiefly in the   
 county of Suffolk and contains the two
 small and scattered villages of       
 Barsham and Shipmeadow. The land      
 gently slopes towards the marshes and 
 floodplain of the River Waveney which 
 lies to the north of the block. The   
 area is very rural and the population 
 about 200 is very scattered. The      
 predominant occupation is agriculture,
 with a mixture of arable farming and  
 fruit growing on the higher ground.   
 The River Waveney forms part of the   
 Norfolk/Suffolk Broads system, a      
 popular venue for tourism and         
 particularly boating holidays. The    
 derelict lock at Shipmeadow forms the 
 present limit of navigation on the    
 river. The river marshes are chiefly  
 used for grazing as they regularly    
 flood in the winter.                  </content>
