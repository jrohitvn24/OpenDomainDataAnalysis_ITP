		<title>15A CHILD'S DAY - CLAIRE</title>
		<content>    Last Saturday I helped my mum hang 
 out the washing.  At eight o'clock    
 Dawn, my sister, was still in bed but 
 I was watching the Saturday Picture   
 Show on T.V.. Then Grandad came for me
 and I put on my coat and shoes and    
 went with Grandad to the launderette  
 in Newhey. Dawn and Mum were left to  
 do all of the housework. When we came 
 back all four of us had sausage and   
 mashed potato for dinner and then we  
 went out to Dale Mill - a local shop. 
 Mum bought me a white cardigan and an 
 anorak. We came back and had tea and  
 then Dawn and I played out with Rachel
 Shaw until 9.3Op.m..                  
   On Sunday we went to church at      
 11.OOa.m.. We took our Bibles too.    
 When  we came home we had egg         
 sandwiches and went out to play. We   
 met some friends and played a game of 
 rounders.                             </content>
