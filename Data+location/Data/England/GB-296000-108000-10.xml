		<title>10A BUTTERLEIGH FARM</title>
		<content>    They came here in 1962.When they   
 arrived it was old and battered.      
    When they came here the top storey 
 was used for keeping chickens and all;
 the mess was thrown down a shute into 
 a pit.                                
    There has been a settlement there  
 for hundreds of years but the present 
 farm was rebuilt in 1752.             
    The farm was once used for holding 
 smuggled goods from France and people 
 used to come there and buy the goods  
 on a {Black Market} system.           
  {                                    
    Since the owners have been there   
 they have had many difficult          
 winters,the worst of which was        
 1962-1963 when they were snowed in for
 13 weeks and the water supply was cut 
 off.
