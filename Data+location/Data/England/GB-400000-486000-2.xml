		<title>02THREE VILLAGES, WENSLEYDALE</title>
		<content> There are three villages in our area, 
 Aysgarth, Thoralby and West Burton.   
 All three were recorded in the        
 Domesday Book and all were in the land
 of Earl Allan of Richmond. Aysgarth   
 had "three carucates and two ploughs. 
 Cnut had a manor there. Gosfrid now   
 has it".  Thoralby had "six carucates 
 and four ploughs". West Burton had    
  " six carucates and four ploughs."   
 Bernulf and Gosfrid owned the manors  
 respectively. The houses in the       
 villages and the surrounding farms are
 now almost all owned by the people who
 live in them. There are a few tenant  
 farmers and in each village there are 
 a few houses owned by the local       
 council. In Thoralby there are some   
 council bungalows for the elderly. In 
 all the villages there are several    
 holiday cottages owned by local people
 but rented out to holiday-makers.     </content>
