		<content>  Parish Council produces a quarterly  
 newsletter, written and delivered by  
 councillors. The June 1985 issue dealt
 with a memorial to Dr. McDonald who   
 died after 36 years practice in the   
 area; community advisers to help with 
 peace-time disasters; transport to    
 health service facilities. A Church   
 and Parish monthly magazine produced  
 by volunteers, has a letter from the  
 Rector, a diary of local events,      
 details of Anglican, Methodist        
 and Catholic service times, and       
 information contributed by local      
 advertisers. This Magazine, along with
 Radio Cumbria-the local radio station,
 and the "Cumberland News"- the local  
 weekly newspaper, is used to report on
 and advertise local happenings.
