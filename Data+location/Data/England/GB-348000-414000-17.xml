		<title>17Maltkiln Farm, Eccleston</title>
		<content>    Mrs Quigg, the farmer, comes       
from a family which has farmed in      
this area  for four generations. Her   
husband works in the industrial        
building industry, but helps on the    
farm in his spare time. Like his       
father before him, he has worked as a  
blacksmith. Mrs Quigg  has an evening  
job, teaching fashion and design at    
evening classes.                       
    Maltkiln Farm is a beef farm,      
begun by her when they moved there. At 
present she has 100 cattle, but aims   
to have 200. She buys cross-bred       
calves  when they are 1 week old,      
feeding them initially on dried milk   
powder. When they are between 14 and   
20 months old she sells them, at       
Wigan, Chelford or  Beeston cattle     
markets. The only time  extra help is  
employed is at hay-making time.
