		<content>driver can be promoted,but it doesn't  
depend on how long he has worked,but   
how good he is.                        
 There are different fares 15,25,30,40+
55.Though this depends on which zones  
you travel through.                    
                                       
OPINIONS OF LOCAL PEOPLE               
 We interviewed a number of people     
about the bus service.Most people      
thought that it was very good indeed   
and that they could easily travel in   
any direction.Some complained of long  
waits for buses at certain times in the
day.Some people said that they         
preferred to travel by underground     
railway as this was more reliable.
