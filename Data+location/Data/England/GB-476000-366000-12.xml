		<content>  {Normanton}has a{Wesleyan chapel     
 still in use, and a{parish church.}The
 chapel dates from 1822. The parish    
 church,{St. Matthew's,}has a Norman   
 tower, which was crumbling and has    
 been made safe by removing the top    
 section. The church services are held 
 on a Sunday by the Vicar from Sutton, 
 and by special arrangements at other  
 times.                                
{  Weston parish church}is{All Saints',
 has a spire, and dates back to circa. 
 1100 with additions through the years.
 Some very old yew trees in the grounds
 indicate the past need for protection 
 by bow and arrow (This is a common    
 find in older churchyards.) The belfry
 is unsafe and so the bells are never  
 rung. The Vicar of Tuxford holds the  
 services here with a similar agreement
 to Normanton. The original{chapel}at  
 Weston is now a private home.         </content>
