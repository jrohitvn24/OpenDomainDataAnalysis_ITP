		<title>10Holywell Wood, Castleford</title>
		<content> Once Holywell was a quarry for        
 limestone.  They had earlier dug mine 
 tunnels for sandstone which was useful
 for making glass bottles.  While they 
 were digging they discovered a Roman  
 burial site.  There is a well in the  
 woods which people used to think had  
 holy water in.                        
 Now the derelict sandhills are used   
 for BMX tracks.  Trees had been       
 destroyed in the 1985 miners strike to
 be used as fire wood.                 
 From Holywell on a clear day you can  
 see Ferrybridge Power Station,        
 Pontefract Park, and the Open Cast    
 Site.                                 
 In the Holywell wood there is wildlife
 like ants, spiders and wild           
 strawberries.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
