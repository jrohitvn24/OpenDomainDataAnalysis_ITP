 Classroom organisation sees the       
 children working in groups. Some      
 children will be working in the       
 teaching area where there are tables  
 and chairs and a blackboard. Equipment
 is stored in drawer units arranged    
 around the room. Other children will  
 be found working at various activities
 in the quiet corner, wet area and wing
 area. The shared areas (hall, TV room,
 music room) are timetabled between the
 classes. For other areas of the       
 curriculum the individual teacher     
 plans and manages his/her own day.The 
 computer is also timetabled to visit  
 each classroom once a week.
