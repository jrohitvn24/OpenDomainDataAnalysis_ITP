		<title>17ROAD CROSSING PATROL</title>
		<content> In school term time 42 children are   
 helped across dangerous Straight Road,
 Old Windsor by Mrs.Baker,the Road     
 Crossing Patrol,morning and afternoon.
 She switches on flashing warning      
 lights at each side of the road ;she  
 crosses at an island.She stops traffic
 by placing the pole of her circular   
 sign with"STOP-CHILDREN CROSSING"on it
 on the road facing traffic;she goes to
 the island,repeats this action;when   
 she tells children to cross they do.  
 She is called "lollipop lady"because  
 her sign is that shape.There have been
 no accidents at the crossing in 1985; 
 she has to jump out of the way when   
 drivers fail to stop;she says motor-  
 cylists are most dangerous as they are
 hard to see in busy traffic.
