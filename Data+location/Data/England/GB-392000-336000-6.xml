		<content>Before being called the County Primary 
School our school was called Fulford   
Church of England School.Then it was on
the village green but now it is on     
Fulford Rd.The new school opened on    
June 25 l928.At the time 78 children   
were on roll and the head teacher was  
Miss Boon.The number of children had   
fallen to 50 by 1932.The next year only
43 children were on roll and only 2    
teachers were employed.Since this time 
there has been an increase in numbers. 
Today there are 57 children on roll and
this  increase has been brought about  
by newcomers settling in the area.Mrs  
Blood is the current head teacher and  
has two other staff to help.           
The age group is 5-11 and when they    
reach 11 most go on to Blythe Bridge   
High School which is four km.to the    
north.
