		<title>16A DAY IN THE LIFE OF GRAHAM</title>
		<content>    On Sunday 16th June 1985 at 7.45 I 
 woke up and had my breakfast and at   
 8.15 me and my Dad went to the dump   
 and got rid of some garden rubbish. On
 the way back we stopped to book a     
 court. When we were there we found    
 some tins for the village fete. When  
 we got home we had a drink of '7-up'  
 in the garden. A few minutes after    
 having a drink I went for a walk with 
 my Dad and practised golf with a real 
 golf ball. For lunch we had chicken   
 salad.                                
    During the afternoon I played tin  
 can alley, golf and tennis. Katie and 
 I cycled to the garage to get some    
 firelighters for Alan and David's     
 barbecue. After tea we packed our     
 sleeping bags to go to Felicity's     
 house. I came home at half past       
 eleven.                               
                                       </content>
