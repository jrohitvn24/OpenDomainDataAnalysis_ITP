 On Spring Bank Holiday Monday         
Rothersthorpe village has a fund       
raising day to help certain charities. 
 This Fund Raising is called Smuggler's
Run and was started about four years   
ago. Two people from the village       
Mr Tucker and Mr Dickins help organise 
this run.                              
 The competion last all day and it is  
open to anyone who wishes to compete.  
People have to compete in teams and    
usually besides local teams there are  
teams from the Police, Army etc.       
 Smuggler's Run is an obstacle course  
over fields, Canals, through barns,    
over rivers, sometimes using rafts and 
sometimes climbing ropes.              
 All teams are timed and it is the     
fastest time for completing the course.
