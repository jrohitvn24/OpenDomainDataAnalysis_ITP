 The heyday of the works may well be   
 beyond living memory, but not without 
 testimony from the past. In the 1780's
 the Horsehay Works was owned by       
 Abraham Darby 111. It was the most    
 important of the Darby works. The     
 evidence from this time is to be found
 in the houses around the works and in 
 the furnace pool.                     
 Looking on to the furnace pool is the 
 Old Row Cottages, Nos 3 to 17, a long 
 row of 15 brick cottages, two storeys 
 high,and two windows per cottage with 
 wooden casements. The first floor     
 windows are under small gables. The   
 houses were built in the 1750's to    
 house the workers in the ironworks. At
 that time each cottage consisted of   
 four rooms. Though the modern owners  
 have extended them at the back, and   
 added gabled kitchens etc.            </content>
