		<content> The most popular jobs in my survey    
 were miners. This is mainly because of
 the area we live in with coal mines   
 round about.  Nearly all my mums side 
 ot the familiynwhere miners but my    
 uncle who is 29 years old and my      
 grandad are deputies of collieries,   
 but my uncle is at the Tech because he
 is going to be a manager.  This means 
 that people are becoming  more in     
 charge and higher jobs at younger     
 ages.  All the people I have surveyed 
 believed in male and female equality  
 in jobs, but my mum and aunty says    
 that they still like to be taken out  
 by their husband and wouldn't pay for 
 a man.  Nobody in my survey has had   
 the same job all their life this is   
 sometimes because they have been      
 promoted or because the firm they     
 worked for have closed down or moved  
 their shops to other towns.           </content>
