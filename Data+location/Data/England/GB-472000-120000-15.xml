		<content>{SOUTHERN OUTSKIRTS-PETERSFIELD SCHOOL:
 This school, built between the A3 and 
 the Cranford Road Estate is an 11-18  
 years Comprehensive School.  It is    
 reducing in size, having been about   
 1200 pupils on roll a few years ago,  
 it is now only 794 (Sept. 1985). These
 reduced numbers make it difficult to  
 maintain a sixth form especially as it
 is in competition with a number of    
 Sixth Form Colleges and Further       
 Education Colleges.  It has 82 sixth  
 formers (Sept. 1985) and has achieved 
 a good reputation for examination     
 success.  The school has good         
 facilities including a sports hall,   
 workshops, science laboratories and a 
 rural studies centre.  It has a strong
 musical tradition.  In spite of the   
 reduction in staff new courses are    
 being introduced which include        
 Information Technology, TVEI and CPVE.</content>
