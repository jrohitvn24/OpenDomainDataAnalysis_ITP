		<content>{Bus sevices run through Denwick every 
{2 hours}and most villagers find this  
 adequate, but some would like an      
 hourly service to Alnwick.Almost all  
 have{the use of a car and this is     
{generally regarded as a necessity     
{rather than a luxury.}Although Mrs.   
 Dixon remembers most villagers having 
 a bike or a 'bone-shaker'the{roads are
{very busy now and dangerous for       
{cyclists.}The children have B.M.X.s   
 which they ride in the fields.The road
 which cuts the village in two is very 
 busy and has{no speed restriction.}In 
 a period of about three quarters of an
 hour over 400 vehicles passed through 
 the village;most were cars travelling 
 quickly and only slowing down for the 
 bend,78 were lorries or large vans and
 there were 13 slow moving farm        
 vehicles.{It is surprising that there 
{are very few accidents.               </content>
