		<title>13The Knepp Estate, Shipley.2.</title>
		<content> Knepp has to a great extent survived  
 as an integrated, private estate      
 balancing commercial management with  
 country sporting activities.          
 Until 1975 two gamekeepers were fully 
 employed to support the extensive,    
 private shoot. The forestry management
 is forward looking and plantations    
 provide softwoods for pulping and     
 Christmas trees, hardwoods for        
 building, fencing and maintenance     
 needs of the estate.                  
 Knepp has good fox hunting country for
 the Crawley and Horsham Hunt whose    
 opening meet is held at Knepp Castle. 
 Knepp Mill Pond, a hammer pond of     
 Wealden iron industry origins provides
 private recreation in the form of     
 skating in Winter and income from the 
 sales of coarse fish and eels when it 
 is drained every five years.
