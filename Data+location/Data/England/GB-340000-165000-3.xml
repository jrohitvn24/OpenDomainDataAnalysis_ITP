		<content> POISON:To play Poison you can have as 
 many people as you like.Someone sits  
 down,they are the poison.Then the rest
 make a ring around them and move      
 about.If anybody touches the person in
 the middle they're out.               
 MOVING TARGET is when players stand   
 against the wall and someone has a    
 ball and throws it at them.The players
 who are standing against the wall have
 to dodge the ball.When someone is hit 
 by the ball they're on it.            
 FRENCH SKIPPING:You need about 3m.of  
 elastic.Then you choose who is going  
 to be first.Two people stand a metre  
 apart,the elastic stretched round     
 their ankles.The other person starts  
 to jump onto the elastic at different 
 angles.When they miss its the next    
 person to go.
