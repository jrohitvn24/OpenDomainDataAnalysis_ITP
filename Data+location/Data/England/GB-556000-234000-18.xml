		<title>18Wimbish Primary School</title>
		<content> The main building is over 100 years   
 old but there have been additions and 
 improvements in recent years.In 1985  
 there are 90 children on roll aged    
 from 5 to 11 years.The children follow
 a varied curriculum though Reading,   
 English and Mathematics are considered
 very important.At Christmas all the   
 children take part in a musical play  
 which is so popular with parents and  
 friends it has to be performed at     
 least twice.In the Autumn the School  
 holds a Harvest Festival Service to   
 which all the children bring gifts of 
 flowers,fruit,groceries or vegetables.
 These gifts are later taken in gaily  
 decorated baskets to about 40 sick or 
 elderly people in the Parish.Sport is 
 popular athletics,football,netball,   
 rounders &amp; swimming-many can swim over
 2,000metres and gain the Gold,Silver  
 or Bronze Amateur Swimming Awards.    </content>
