 "Thorold Arms".                       
 Religion is catered for by two C.of E.
 churches;  St.Mary's Marston and All  
 Saints Hougham.                       
 The River Witham flows through the    
 area but is unnavigable at this point.
 Transport in the area is represented  
 by the main railway link between      
 London and Edinburgh although the     
 local station has closed.             </content>
