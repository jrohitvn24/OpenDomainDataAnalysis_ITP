		<title>17SCHOOL PLAYTIME</title>
		<content> The school at Walesby has a large     
 grass and hard-core play area and the 
 children play many games, one of the  
 favourites played during break times  
 is "British Bulldog". This game is    
 play in a defined area, usually using 
 the markings of a hockey or netball   
 pitch. The person who is "on" stands  
 in the middle of this area with the   
 rest standing behind one of the lines 
 at the end. The person in the middle  
 calls out the name of one person at   
 the end, this person then has to      
 attempt to run to the opposite end of 
 the court. If he/she succeeds in      
 running to the end the rest of the    
 group may follow. If the person called
 is caught and held whilst the caller  
 shouts "British Bulldog" then they    
 join the caller and another person is 
 called.
