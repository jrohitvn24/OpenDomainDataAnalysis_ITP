		<content> Village. Leading from the village     
 towards Chichester is a straight road 
 with Gravel Pits on either side and   
 wheat fields.  There are ten cottages 
 and a Kingdom hall if the Jehaovahs   
 witnesses. There is also the Portfield
 Depot of the Water Authority and the  
 local Driving Test Centre.            
 Almost all the land around the        
 villages  is used for arable farming. 
 Crops grown include wheat, barley,    
 oats and peas.  There are also some   
 sheep and cows. There are many modern 
 houses built of bricks and tiles. Some
 are very large gardens. There are also
 cottages of flint but very few houses 
 have thatched roofs. The houses are   
 Council or Private. The now water     
 filled Gravel Pits are used for       
 leisure. The ground itself is very    
 much clay.  (by Holly W.)
