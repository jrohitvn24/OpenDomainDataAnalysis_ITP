		<title>19 RECENT EVENTS IN WEEDON BEC</title>
		<content>  Earlier this year the {Royal Military
Depot} was used to film an             
advertisement for television.We did    
not know about it until we heard some  
very loud explosions and saw lots of   
bright lights.It advertised razors.    
  Every year {the fair} comes to the   
playing field behind the village       
hall.We look forward to that because   
you get good rides.                    
  They are building some new houses in 
West Street and many people are cross  
because they cut down some nice trees. 
  Each year the churches,the school and
other groups have jumble sales,bazaars 
and barbecues to raise money.This year 
our school has raised a lot of money   
for {Dr Barnardos Homes}.              
  Peter,a 16 year old in our village,  
won a 9000 pound car in a golf         
competition.He had to answer 50        
questions on golf.                     </content>
