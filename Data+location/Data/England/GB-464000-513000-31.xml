<content>

Stanghow now has about 50 houses, all with open views of the surrounding countryside.  The village of Stanghow has had great success winning medals in Northumbria in Bloom and Britain in Bloom competitions since 2008, with most of the 125 residents involved.  The village was jointly named as best small village (with Wolfcastle in Wales) in Britain in Bloom in 2010. &lt;br />&lt;br />There is a statue of a blacksmith at the crossroads as a reminder of the old forge.  The Community Centre celebrated its centenary in May 2011.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
