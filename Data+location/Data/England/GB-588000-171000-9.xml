		<content>    We surveyed 12 men and 14 women to 
 find out about their leisure          
 activities. They were mainly poeple in
 the 25-40 age group, although 3 were  
 about 60 years old.                   
    Mrs Starling told us the study of  
 the{Bible}was an important part of her
 life.                                 
    Mr Honess' hobby is{motorcycling.  
 He enjoys repairing and refurbishing  
 them and touring the countryside on   
 them.                                 
    Mr Reckless listed{computing}and   
{electronics}as his interesting        
 hobbies.                              
    The majority of people watch T.V.  
 for several hours each day. Of 36     
 families only one has no television.
