		<title>19Newton Bridge Closure 1984</title>
		<content>{Suddenly,}in September British Rail   
 announced that,due to a weakened      
 structure,the{A49 road bridge}at      
 Newton must{close for repair.}Traffic 
 surveys by school children showed     
 over 200 vehicles an hour crossed the 
 bridge.The council made arrangements  
 for heavy traffic to use the A4110,&amp;  
{light traffic}to use{Bowley Lane}to   
 get to Leominster from Hope.Intense   
{protests}by local people were{ignored.
 In October the bridge closed.Diverted 
 traffic,laboriously ground its way    
 along these{inadequate lanes.}The very
 narrow Bowley Lane soon turned in to a
{quagmire of mud.}Grass verges were all
 churned up and cars got stuck.Work on 
 the bridge proceeded.The old structure
 was removed down to the brick lining. 
{Reinforced concrete}was infilled and a
 sturdy brick parapet was built at road
 level.{A49 reopened Christmas 1984.   </content>
