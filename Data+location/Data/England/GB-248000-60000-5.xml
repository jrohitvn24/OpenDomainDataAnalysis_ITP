		<title>05DRAKES LEAT,DEVONPORT LEAT</title>
		<content> At the top of our school field there  
 are remains of the two leats which    
 used to carry water from Dartmoor to  
 Plymouth.In 1591 Drakes Leat was      
 built.Sir Francis Drake supervised    
 the building.It took water from the   
 River Meavy and was 17 miles long.    
 It discharged its water into the sea  
 at Millbay.Later the leat went into   
 Drakes reservoir, near the City       
 Museum.When Burrator Reservoir was    
 built Drakes Leat was no longer needed
 so it is now dry.As Devonport grew    
 into a town,more water was needed so  
 Devonport Leat was built in 1793.It   
 took water from three rivers, the     
 Cowsic, the Blackabrook and the West  
 Dart. It now flows into Burrator and  
 from there to Plymouth the leat is    
 dry.Burrator Reservoir was built in   
 1893.Now a new reservoir is planned   
 because Burrator is not big enough.   </content>
