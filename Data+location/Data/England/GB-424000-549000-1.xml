		<content> The market town of Chester-le-Street  
 is situated in the North East of      
 England in County Durham,about eight  
 miles south of Newcastle and seven    
 miles north of the cathedral city of  
 Durham. Chester-le-Street itself lies 
 on the western side  of the river     
 Wear.In Roman times it was called     
 'Congcangium' and was an important    
 Roman camp.In A.D. 883 Lindisfarne    
 monks brought St. Cuthbert's body to  
 Chester-le-Street while searching for 
 a safe burial place.They stayed at St.
 Cuthbert's church, which now has a    
 spire of 169 feet.Chester-le-Street   
 has an excellent line of communication
 ,being on the East Coast main line    
 railway,linking London and Edinburgh. 
 This runs over an impressive 11 span  
 viaduct.
