		<content>{Mr. C. Gibbard-Village Lengthman.} We 
interviewed Mr Gibbard who has been    
employed as the Lengthman since the    
job was created in 1983. He told us    
that   the dirtiest place in M.C. is   
behind the chip shop. His busiest day  
is on a Monday after the weekend. In   
1984 M.C. won the Northamptonshire     
Tidiest Village Competition (large     
village section).                      
 {Mr L. Jerrams-Local Historian.} Mr   
Jerrams has lived in M.C. all his life.
His house,"Celanlea", is a very old    
cottage which is a listed building. In 
1984 Mr Jerrams had his first book     
published,"A Brief History Of Middleton
Cheney, Northamptonshire With Childhood
Memories". Mr Jerrams has recorded in  
his book how the Village has changed   
during his lifetime and what buildings 
have been destroyed; for example 23    
houses in Queen Street alone.          </content>
