		<content> None of the roads in the valley has   
 been treated with weedkiller for some 
 years, so the vegetation is abundant. 
 On and over the walls in the higher   
 land are brambles and raspberries and 
 where the verges are near water there 
 are crops of many varieties of rushes,
 grasses and bog plants. Heather,      
 foxgloves, broom, gorse, bracken,     
 thistles, small trees which are       
 self-sown, such as silver birch and   
 ash. Clover and rough grazing for     
 cattle and sheep, rabbits and roe     
 deer. No large plantations, much      
 self-sown. Larch trees at Knipe Tarn  
 are very lovely.
