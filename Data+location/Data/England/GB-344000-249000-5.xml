		<content>  Our W.I. has just celebrated it's    
 second 21st.Birthday! It was disbanded
 in 1960 but began again in 1964.      
 The membership averages about 20      
 members, mainly middle-class ladies   
 over 30 years of age.Winter meetings  
 are not well attended mainly because  
 the Village Hall is cold. Our branch  
 has a good reputation for culinary    
 skills, and is in great demand to     
 provide refreshments for fetes,       
 festivals etc.We try to help our local
 community, running "Meals on Wheels"  
 and a Community Service Scheme whereby
 anyone in trouble can telephone for   
 help from a list of members.Help can  
 range from collecting medicine, taking
 people to hospital, to delivering     
 wreaths to a cemetery in another      
 village! We have recently won two     
 drama awards, and take part in darts, 
 rounders and scrabble tournaments.    </content>
