		<title>19VILLAGE LIFE IN THE TARRANTS</title>
		<content> LIFE IN THIS AREA IS VERY QUIET AND   
 PEACEFUL. THE SMALL VILLAGE HALL IS   
 THE CENTRE FOR SEVERAL ACTIVITIES.    
 THERE IS A CLUB FOR THE SENIOR        
 CITIZENS OF TARRANT RUSHTON, RAWSTON  
 AND KEYNSTON. THIS IS CALLED THE      
 WEDNESDAY CLUB. THE MEMBERS CAN PLAY  
 WHIST AND DOMINOES AND CHOOSE BOOKS   
 FROM A SELECTION ON LOAN FROM THE     
 COUNTY LIBRARY IN POOLE. THERE IS     
 OFTEN A GUEST SPEAKER AND TEA IS      
 PROVIDED. THE LOCAL RECTOR USUALLY    
 CALLS IN FOR A CHAT. OTHER ACTIVITIES 
 IN THE HALL INCLUDE A WEEKLY YOUTH    
 CLUB, FORTNIGHTLY WHIST DRIVES  AND   
 OCCASIONAL DISCOS.                    
 MOST RESIDENTS SHOP IN BLANDFORD. ONLY
 A FEW ITEMS, GENERALLY SPEAKING, ARE  
 PURCHASED FROM THE VILLAGE SHOP. MANY 
 PEOPLE GROW SOME FRUIT AND            
 VEGETABLES AND MAKE THEIR OWN CAKES.
