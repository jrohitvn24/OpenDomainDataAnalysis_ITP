		<title>18Angling at Pitsford Water</title>
		<content>   In an interview on 1st.July,1985,the
 warden described how the area has     
 become a{popular location}for trout   
 fishing.                              
    The water is{stocked}in November or
 December with about 5OOO brown trout  
 and 7OOO rainbow trout. Over half of  
 the rainbow trout will not survive a  
 bad winter.The warden was surprised   
 that there are{no pike}in Pitsford.   
   {Trout}may only be caught by fly    
 fishing. Fish under 12" long must be  
 put back.Any person breaking this rule
 faces an{immediate ban}from the water.
 There are 12O season tickets available
 at Â£3O each. Most people buy Â£5 (day) 
 or Â£3.5O (evening) tickets. The{record
{catch}stands at 8lb 9oz for a brown   
 trout and 7lb 6oz for a rainbow.      
    The warden commented on how{few    
{women or girls}seemed to be attracted 
 to the sport of angling.              </content>
