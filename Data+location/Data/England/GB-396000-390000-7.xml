		<content> Vincent's Egg Farm and the            
 North-east Cheshire Drag Hunt.        
                                       
 On Tuesday my friends and I went to   
 look at some places near Woodseats.   
 The places which were most interesting
 were the Egg Farm and the North-east  
 Cheshire Drag Hunt. First we went to  
 the place where the puppies were kept.
 The hound puppies were gorgeous. We   
 couldn't go in because it said Private
 on the gate and there was a big bitch 
 prowling around. Then all the little  
 puppies came running over, chewing and
 licking our fingers.                  
 We carried on down to the egg farm    
 where we saw a load of eggs all piled 
 in cages ready to be sent away.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
