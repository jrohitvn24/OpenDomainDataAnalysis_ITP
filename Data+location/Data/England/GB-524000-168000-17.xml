		<content> In Mitcham there are many shops. There
 are three supermarkets in Mitcham and 
 also many restaurants, and take away  
 food stores.The equipment for shops is
 quite modern. The tills are all       
 computerized.Most tobacconist shops   
 sell not only sweets  and tobacco but 
 also writing pads,pens etc.The grocery
 stores have the goods on show outside 
 the shop.There is a law that says     
 cigarettes can't be sold to people    
 under the age of 16.The pubs in       
 Mitcham are clean and situated in good
 places.They open at 5:30 and close at 
 10:30 but in Wimbledon they close at  
 11:00.On special occasions some pubs  
 stay open until midnight.In Mitcham at
 night there's not much traffic about, 
 and if you're wandering about there's 
 not much to do.
