		<content> As Peacehaven boys we like to join in 
 with the sports at school(Hoddern) and
 out of school.Out of school sports are
 football, cricket,tennis,golf and     
 rounders.Most towns and villages run  
 youth teams who take part in          
 competitions.We enjoy our sport very  
 much.Our local football team is called
 Peacehaven Pirates.Several of us      
 belong to Rottingdean Cricket Club    
 colts team.                           
 A Drama group is held on Saturday at  
 the Youth Centre.First we do some     
 relaxation then we do some mime and   
 follow this with acting out various   
 situations.We learn dramatic passages 
 to speak and act.                     
 There is a Scout Troop which meets on 
 a Friday.We have a Scout band which is
 made up of members of all the scouting
 and guiding organisations.
