		<title>08A typical Sunday</title>
		<content> In the morning I get dressed, go down 
 stairs and have my breakfast. This is 
 usually cereals such as rice crispies.
 At about nine o'clock my mum goes out 
 into the garden to weed the rockery or
 crazy paving. I ask a friend if he can
 play.We often go down to the church   
 and then we go to the stream.At the   
 brook we like building a camp out of  
 mud, planks,grass and reeds.At about  
 one o'clock I go back home for lunch. 
 My favourite lunch is chicken with    
 roast potatoes and peas. After lunch I
 help dad to put up a new fence to keep
 in Bracken my dog. After my tea which 
 is normally salad or sandwiches I     
 watch television until nine           
 o'clock.Then I put on my pajamas, have
 a drink and read my book in bed.Then I
 go to sleep.
