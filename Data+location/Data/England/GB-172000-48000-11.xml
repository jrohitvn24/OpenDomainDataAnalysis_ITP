 by the Parish Church,in Beaconsfield  
 Playing Field. Teams are drawn from   
 various sports clubs and from the     
 three pubs. Started in Jubilee year,  
 the Victorian Fayre on the second May 
 Bank Holiday involves most            
 organisations. Stalls are set up in   
 the main street, which is closed to   
 traffic. Helpers, in costume, parade  
 through the street led by the Town    
 Crier and St.Agnes Silver Band.       
 The Annual Carnival in August is the  
 highlight of the year, being          
 considered one of the best in the     
 County. The "Queen" and her attendants
 lead the procession from the field,   
 where the entrants are judged, through
 the village to Rosemundy and back to  
 the field where the prizes are        
 presented. Visiting Bands join with   
 St. Agnes to give a concert later.    </content>
