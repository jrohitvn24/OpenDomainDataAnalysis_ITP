 wash,clean my teeth and brush my hair 
 before getting dressed ready for      
 breakfast.While having breakfast I    
 talk to my dad and collect my bus fare
 so I can get home from {SCHOOL} in {  
{GOODWORTH CLATFORD.}I arrive at school
 with my friend Clare.We have different
 lessons as part of our{EDUCATION,}some
 are maths,English and nature.At 11-50 
 we have dinner,I hope it is cheese and
 lentil flan--my favourite.In the      
 afternoon we have {SPORT,}I like      
 netball.At 3-25 we catch the bus home 
 and I am always hungry so we have our

 tea dad goes to play badminton,so     
 Clare,Tara and I go swimming at the   
 Sports Centre for an hour.Dad collects
 us to go home,we are tired,a little   
 supper and off to bed.
