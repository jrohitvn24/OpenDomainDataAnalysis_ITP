		<title>12 The Iron House.</title>
		<content>Property situated on the old Arley Rd  
which probably was used as a pack horse
route to Bewdley.Before the Staffs &amp;   
Worcs canal was cut,produce of Stour   
valley iron-works were transported in  
this way.During the 3rd quarter of the 
18th centuary the property was probably
an inn.Judging by the cellars.Hearsay  
has it that it was the last pub to     
Arley.Judging the remaining parts of   
the structure it was a sandstone       
building.The weather affected the      
sandstone so iron plates were attached 
to the outer walls.The house was owned 
by a family,their name was Griffiths,  
from 1825-1850.In 1915 there was a fi- 
re &amp; the iron plates prevented the     
flames from being extinguished &amp; the   
near portions of the house were        
destroyed.It was rebuilt in 1916.
