		<title>19Children's Games and Crazes</title>
		<content> There are lots of different games     
 played in this area. They include     
 football,cricket,tennis,rounders,     
 netball,snooker,darts and conkers.    
 Conkers is a game for two people who  
 each have a horse chestnut on a       
 string. One person holds his/her      
 conker up and the other tries to hit  
 it by swinging their own at it. If you
 break the other conker then yours     
 becomes a '1-er'.It is usually played 
 in late September/early October when  
 the chestnuts are being blown off the 
 trees by the autumn gales.            
 A popular craze, at the moment,is     
 BMX bicycle racing. This is carried   
 out on special bikes designed for     
 cross-country and stunt riding.       
 Special clothes are used for BMX      
 racing to protect riders from cuts    
 and bruises.They include helmets and  
 pads for elbows and knees.            </content>
