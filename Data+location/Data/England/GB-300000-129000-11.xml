		<title>11A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> I am a seven year old boy and I live  
 at Bittescombe Manor near the village 
 of Upton on the Brendon Hills. My     
 father has a 300 acre farm on which he
 keeps 300 breeding ewes. My mother, my
 two brothers and my sister all help at
 lambing time.                         
 In the term time I get up at seven    
 o'clock and get dressed in my school  
 uniform. We have breakfast, sometimes 
 toast, sometimes fried eggs, bacon or 
 sausages. We drink milk, or orange    
 juice from a carton. I then put on my 
 blazer and we drive seveteen miles to 
 school in Taunton. This takes about   
 thirty five minutes and school starts 
 at 9.00 o'clock.                      
 School ends at 4.00 and I am given    
 some homework to do. I do this when I 
 get home and so I have some time left 
 to play.                              
                                       </content>
