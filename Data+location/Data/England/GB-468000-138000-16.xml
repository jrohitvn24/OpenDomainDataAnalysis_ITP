		<content>    We used to do handstands against   
 the wall,Moon,Star,Thunder,Lightning, 
 were the names of handstands.         
    We play British Bulldog on the     
 playground.A person in the middle     
 calls " British Bulldog 1_2_3"and     
 the others try to run from one side to
 the other without being caught.       
    In Red Rover there are two lines of
 children holding hands,facing one     
 another,some distance apart.You       
 say"Red Rover"twice and pick someone  
 from the other line.They try to run   
 and break through your line,but have  
 to join it if they fail.              
    In 40_40 one player counts while   
 the others hide.Then he searches and  
 calls"40_40 seen"and the person's name
 and where he's seen them.The others   
 try to touch the base and say "40_40  
 in."                                  
                                       </content>
