		<title>01Our Area</title>
		<content> Our area is situated on the eastern   
 bank of the River Trent about twenty  
 miles from where it enters the Humber 
 Estuary.Most of the area is arable    
 farmland,growing crops like oil-seed  
 rape and sugar-beet.The area includes 
 the village of Morton,where our school
 is and the northern half of the town  
 of Gainsborough.Morton has a          
 population of 1,230,Gainsborough one  
 of about 17,000.                      
  The underlying soil is clay          
 with deposits of sand and alluvial    
 silt,known locally as "warp".The main 
 local industries produce packaging,   
 ,wallpaper,tractors and shelving      
 systems.Unemployment is quite high    
 because of the decline in agricultural
 engineering.There are many social     
 problems in the area,including        
 vandalism and burglary,committed by   
 the young unemployed.                 </content>
