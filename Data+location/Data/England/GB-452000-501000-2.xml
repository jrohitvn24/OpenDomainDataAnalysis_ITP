		<content> Carlton Bank being 1200 ft above      
 sea-level is ideal for both gliding   
 and hang-gliding. Newcastle &amp; Teesside
 gliding club have been on Carlton Bank
 for 20 yrs. They have 20 members, 2   
 gliders and 1 motor glider with 5     
 others belonging to syndicates,flying 
 every weekend &amp; all holidays, weather 
 permitting, usually to over 3000ft.   
 The highest achieved was 22000ft (with
 oxygen). The longest flight was to    
 Doncaster and back. The average flight
 lasts 5hrs for 50-60 miles. A glider  
 costs Â£800 2nd hand to Â£6000 for a 2  
 seater. A new glider would cost Â£1200.
 Depending on the weather, hang-gliders
 take off into wind from Carlton  Bank,
 Model Ridge &amp; Cringle Moor which      
 face NW,N &amp; NE respectively. Gliding  
 to over 1500ft is achieved depending  
 on thermals &amp; cloud cover, and much   
 higher if the weather is good.        </content>
