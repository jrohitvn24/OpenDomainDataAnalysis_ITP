		<title>13Loventor Manor Hotel</title>
		<content> The Hotel is called "Loventor" because
 it came from the name "Coventor", but 
 over the years the {C}has changed to  
{L.}It was called "Coventor" because   
 some of the houses were built by a    
 rocky or stoney cove.                 
 The Manor is mentioned in the original
 Domesday Book and twenty two years ago
 became a hotel.                       
 Roughly 1000 people stay at the hotel 
 each year and Anne Weston the owner,  
 also owns some 500 acres of land.     
 The hotel offers entertainment such as
 trout fishing, music and clay pigeon  
 shooting.                             
 The hotel can sleep 24 people and the 
 charge is Â£23 daily per person.       
 It is often used as a conference      
 centre as well as a place for wedding 
 receptions.                           
 We went in some of the rooms, they are
 old fashioned with no plastic at all. </content>
