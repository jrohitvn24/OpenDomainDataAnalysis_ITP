<title>21Newton in the 21st Century</title>
<content>

Newton, the forgotten village. It is often not included on maps but is the actual home of Tibshelf Service Station on the M1. Newton has been my family's home since the early 1900's and is now a commuter village. We have great neighbours, including one of the last few Miners left in the area! Our home looks out on to an old race track for trotting horses, also the old Goodall's Farm. My Mum and Dad (John &amp; John Dempsey) had our house designed and build on Littlemoor Lane and Tony Wiggington (uncle) was the the bricky. Its been a tough 111 years but we are still here. We have a carnival, a community centre, parish playing fields and an amazing trails network which is the old mineral railway tracks.   &lt;br />
