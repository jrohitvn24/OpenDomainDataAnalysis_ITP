		<title>01The Otter Valley</title>
		<content>  The area is predominantly rural with 
 the village of Offwell in the South-  
 west corner and  a large part of the  
 market town of Honiton. Honiton lies  
 on the A30 Exeter-London road and its 
 junction with the A35 to Dorchester.  
 Its railway runs from Exeter to       
 London.                               
  The town lies in the vale of the     
 Otter surrounded by the plateaux of   
 East Devon. The agriculture is mixed  
 pastoral, and cereals.                
  The employment is in agriculture,    
 supply and service industries.        
  The town is designated a growth area 
 for East Devon and has ample building 
 land. The 17C heart of the town is    
 surrounded by modern development. In  
 the country the farms are generally   
 ancient and often of cob and thatch.
