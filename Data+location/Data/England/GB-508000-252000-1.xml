		<title>01Renhold - an introduction</title>
		<content> The village of Renhold is spread over 
 a length of over two miles, some three
 miles to the north east of Bedford.   
 The oldest part of the village is     
 close to the parish church and the    
 rest was formerly made up of a number 
 of{' ends'}like many other settlements
 in the county.                        
                                       
 Again, like many others, these have   
 tended to join up and Renhold today   
 spreads along basically one road with 
 hardly a break.                       
                                       
 The function of the village has       
 changed dramatically in the past fifty
 years. It has become very much a      
 dormitory settlement for Bedford which
 has extended so much that the two     
 places almost meet.                   
                                       
                                       </content>
