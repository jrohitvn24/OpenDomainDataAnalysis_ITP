		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF BLOCK</title>
		<content>   The block lies to the south of the  
 older part of Middlewich. It remains  
 primarily dairy farming country which 
 is why so much of the land survey     
 shows cultivated grassland. The grass 
 is grown to produce sileage for winter
 feed. Most of the post war housing    
 development associated with Middlewich
 lies within the block, and housing    
 estates were being built as the block 
 was being surveyed. The most recent   
 houses are of the small detached type 
 costing in the region of Â£30,000 and  
 most are bought by people moving into 
 the area. In the more rural areas     
 housing development is restricted to  
 modification to existing properties.  
 Although the smaller community at     
 Wimboldsley shares many of the        
 facilities of the larger Middlewich   
 community it retains its individuality
 with its focus as the village school. </content>
