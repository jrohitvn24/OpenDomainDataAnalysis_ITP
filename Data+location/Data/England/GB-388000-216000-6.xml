		<title>06CHOSEN HILL RESERVOIR</title>
		<content> The reservoir is split into 5 parts,4 
 being at the top of the hill and one  
 lower down.The last reservoir was     
 built in 1967 and was the largest,    
 holding 32 megalitres.The overall     
 capacity is 71 megalitres of water.   
  The area served is Gloucester        
 City,and there is a feedback to South 
 Western areas of Cheltenham.          
  Each reservoir has turved banks to   
 merge with the landscape,and the vent 
 pipes have been designed to be        
 unobtrusive.The works buildings are of
 Cotswold stone with mullioned windows,
 and tiling in keeping with the style  
 of the area.                          
  Within the grounds is a warning      
 beacon for aeroplanes from Staverton  
 Airport a few miles away.The whole    
 area is surrounded by a seven foot    
 fence to discourage intruders.
