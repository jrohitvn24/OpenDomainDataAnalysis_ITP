		<title>11OUTLANE DRUM MAJORETTES</title>
		<content>  Caroline Newsome is a member of{     
{Outlane Drum Majorettes.}They used to 
 practise their displays at Outlane    
 Youth Centre. They had been practising
 there since 1982 but were recentley   
 told to move out because of the       
 building's bad condition. With        
 nowhere else to go they had only one  
 week to move their instruments from   
 the building. They therefore decided  
 to publicise their predicament. They  
 tried the television programme{"That's
{Life"}and Esther Ranzen was more than 
 happy to help. They appeared on the   
 programme and a pop group called{"The 
{Strand"}who saw the majorettes perform
 asked them to do a display for their  
 video for the single{"Drum            
{Majorettes."}                         
  The Council could not, however,      
 change their decision.
