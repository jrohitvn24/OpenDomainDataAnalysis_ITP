		<content>{Shireoaks Manor}or{Hall}is at present 
 derelict. It was built by{Thomas      
{Hewett,}who became{Sheriff of         
{Nottingham,}in about 1610. His        
 grandson, another Thomas, who was     
 Surveyor of Works for{Queen Anne}and  
{George 1}around 1700, lived in the    
 Manor after that. The family          
 originally came from{Wales,}near      
{Kiveton Park.}They made their money as
 wool merchants in London and one      
 member of the family,{William Hewett, 
 became{Lord Mayor of London}in the    
 reign of{Elizabeth 1.}The house was   
 designed with a canal, and six water  
 gardens, which are still in existence 
 today although not as impressive as   
 they were then. At the moment the     
{coach houses and stables,}which were  
 converted to cottages in 1914, are    
 being restored to their original state
 for use as a refreshment centre.      </content>
