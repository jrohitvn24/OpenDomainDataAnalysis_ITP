		<content>    Since the{1950's}not a lot if any  
 changes have occured to this area.    
   Travelling West from Seaton Carew   
 you come across a patch of land which 
 used to contain delapidated council   
 houses,these were demolished during   
{1983-84}after standing for about{45   
 years.                                
   Further West you come across more   
 council houses which have recently    
 been modernised.A very small minority 
 of these houses have a garage.They all
 have central heating with running hot 
 and cold water.The houses have small  
 front and back gardens and the houses 
 are all in short terraces.            
{  Rossmere Ward                       
   The houses were built in the{1950's 
 and have medium sized gardens
