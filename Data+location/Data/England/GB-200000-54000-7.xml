		<content>    China Clay extraction leaves the   
 moorland scarred with pits and        
 bespotted with tips, resulting in a   
 lunar landscape loved by film-makers  
 but hated by naturalists.             
    The major producer, English China  
 Clays, spent about 500,000 pounds in  
 1984 on landscaping and reclamation   
 projects. These included in-filling   
 pits, and grassing and levelling tips.
 It is argued that levelling improves  
 the appearance and stability of the   
 tips. Plants such as lupins and a     
 mixture of grasses and clover have    
 been planted and the hills stocked    
 with Soay sheep, a hardy Scottish     
 breed. In some places conifers from   
 the company nursery at Carthew have   
 also been planted.                    
    Many people think that the new,    
 huge, featureless mounds are worse    
 than the old conical "white pyramids".</content>
