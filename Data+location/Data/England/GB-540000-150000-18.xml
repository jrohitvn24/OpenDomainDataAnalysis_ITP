		<title>18A LOCAL SCHOOL GAME</title>
		<content>  BOM BOM.                             
   This game can be played by a group  
 of more than three people. The idea of
 the game is to try to get home before 
 being caught.                         
  One person is chosen to be "UP." This
 person has to wait at a post and count
 to a chosen number. When the person   
 "up" has finished counting they       
 look for the others. If they spot some
 one they run back to the post and say 
 "Bom Bom (name of player) 1, 2, 3.".  
  Sometimes a player can manage to get 
 back to the post before the person up 
 reaches home. They say "Bom Bom home  
 1, 2, 3.". The game finishes when     
 everyone either manages to get home or
 are caught.                           
  If the last person manages to get    
 home they can "save all" and everyone 
 else who have been caught are free and
 the same person is up again.          </content>
