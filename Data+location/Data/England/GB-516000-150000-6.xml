		<content> This{42 acre wood and grassland}site  
 is used by many types of people.It is 
 in the "middle of nowhere"!           
   The land is owned by Surrey County  
 Council. It is a good site because it 
 is{educational,}gives pleasure and a  
 sense of adventure.{Wildlife}is often 
 seen, such as deer,foxes,rabbits,     
 squirrels,badgers and birds,e.g.owls  
 and hawks.                            
   Last year there were 9,000 campers. 
 A timetable is sent ahead of any      
 camping party with suggested          
 activities. If the warden does not    
 approve of it,he returns it for more  
 thought.Camping there is{cheap}(there 
 -fore available to poorer families),  
 as campers only have to pay between   
 45p and 65p per day.
