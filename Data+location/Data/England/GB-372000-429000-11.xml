  Rishton Cricket Club has enough      
support to afford a South African      
professional cricketer, called Mike    
von Vuuren. He comes from Port         
Elizabeth and has about 35 relatives   
there. He arrived here three months    
ago. He came to England to gain        
experience of the world outside South  
Africa. He does not think much of the  
entertainment in Rishton. The only     
entertainment he likes is going for a  
drink and he says there is no          
entertainment for children. He thinks  
that Rishton Cricket Club is much      
better than other clubs. He was only   
six when he started playing cricket. He
prefers to bowl rather than bat, but he
does enjoy batting as well.
