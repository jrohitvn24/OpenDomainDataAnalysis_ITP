		<title>15School Sports Day</title>
		<content> Sports Day is a day when we have      
 races and we have fun.                
 We walk down to the Village Playing   
 Field carrying the mats and apparatus.
 Our families come to watch.           
 The youngest children have the first  
 race then the older children take     
 turns to race.                        
 These are the sorts of races we have  
 :running , egg and spoon , sack ,     
 skipping , piggy-back , 3-legged      
 and relay.                            
 "Kangaroo"; jumping down the track    
 with a rubber ring between your       
 knees. "Wellie Race"; the youngest    
 children race with adults wellingtons 
 on. We laugh a lot during that race.  
 "Angel Race"; running with a rubber   
 ring balanced on your head.           
 After all the racing is over we have  
 an ice-lolly.Then we collect all      
 the apparatus and go back to school.  </content>
