		<title>06WORKING IN A HOSPITAL.</title>
		<content> A surgeon at the Royal Shrewsbury     
 Hospital has a very busy life. At     
 8a.m. each morning he meets a team of 
 doctors and visits wards to see at    
 least 30 patients. He then sees       
 out-patients in the clinic until lunch
 time. During the afternoon he does    
 about 8 operations. When he has       
 finished in the operating theatre he  
 goes back to the wards to check on    
 more patients before he can go home.  
 He is 'on call' for emergencies every 
 third night.                          
  Nurses start their work at 7.30a.m.  
 by reading the reports of thoae who   
 have done night duty. They then go to 
 each patient to see if they are       
 comfortable. After taking round the   
 breakfasts the nurses prepare patients
 for operations, change dressings and  
 give treatment where necessary. Their 
 working day finishes at 5.00p.m.      </content>
