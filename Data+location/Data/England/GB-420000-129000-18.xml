		<title>18LEISURE ACTIVITIES IN FARLEY</title>
		<content> There are some adult clubs in Farley, 
 but not every one belongs to one. The 
 clubs are football, cricket, Women's  
 Institute and youth club. Darts and   
 skittles are played at the pub which  
 has a darts team. They compete with   
 other pub teams.                      
 The adults and children watch some    
 television in their free time. Some of
 the other activities are walking,     
 knitting, sewing, swimming, gardening 
 and reading.                          
 We asked the children what their      
 activities were. Some sports they play
 are rounders, tennis, cricket,        
 football, pool, table tennis, snooker,
 swimming, hockey and netball. Some of 
 their hobbies are collecting stamps,  
 cars, soldiers, stickers and dolls.
