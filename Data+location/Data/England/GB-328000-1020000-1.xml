		<title>01DOUNBY GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> Most of our area was originally       
 heather and marshland, but because of 
 failed efforts by conservationists it 
 is now mainly cultivated{farmland.}In 
 the higher, more remote areas peat    
 cutting is very popular amongst       
 locals. This area is also widely used 
 by{birds}for nesting. Land that is    
 cultivated is mainly grassland.       
 Houses are fairly scattered around our
 area except for those in{Dounby       
 village which have been mainly built  
 around a crossroads. One of the most  
 popular places in Dounby would        
 probably be the pub, called the       
 Smithfield, because people go there   
 for a pint and a yarn.                
{Farming}is the main occupation of the 
 area. Others are employed in local    
 trades and businesses. However, a     
 large number of people in the Dounby  
 area commute to jobs in other places. </content>
