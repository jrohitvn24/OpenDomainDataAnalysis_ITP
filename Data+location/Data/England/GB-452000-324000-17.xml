		<title>17TELEVISION AND THE PRESS</title>
		<content> It was discoved in a survey of 60     
 families that all owned a television  
 set and that more then half owned more
 than one.The people in the survey were
 mainly middle class.                  
 Teletex sets are not common but most  
 people will consider obtaining one    
 when they change their set.           
 Television is viewed a great deal by  
 all members of the family,the most    
 popular programmes being 'Soap Operas'
 such as Dallas and Coronation Street. 
 We were qute surprised to discover    
 that The Sun was the most popular     
 newspaper.The most popular Sunday     
 Newspaper was the News of the World   
 followed by the Sunday Times.         
 Local Newspapers are widely read,the  
 weekly Loughborough Echo selling most 
 copies.This paper concentrates on     
 local news and often contains stories 
 about events in the area covered.     </content>
