		<title>11THE CENTRE, PRINCES RISBOR;</title>
		<content>Risborough Community Centre is small   
but the activities it shelters and     
sponsors reach every section of the    
population. Indoor and outdoor sports  
are centred on the hall, playing fields
and changing rooms; juniors keep fit,  
teenagers roller skate while parents   
and grandparents meet to play scrabble 
and whist, to dance, spin or just chat 
at Clubnights. You can attend an       
Antique Fair, a Wedding Recaption or a 
Church Service; have your feet tended  
by a chiropodist or help the           
rehabilitation of a group of former    
mental patients. If all this can happen
in a sports hall plus Clubroom, the    
planned extensions to include small    
hall, committee rooms, staging and     
extra storage will both reduce the     
pressures on other venues and promote  
even more volunteer or special interest
groups to form and expand the community</content>
