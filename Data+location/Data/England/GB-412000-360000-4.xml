		<title>04Well Dressings</title>
		<content>{Well Dressings}is an ancient          
 Derbyshire custom which probaly       
 originated from offering thanks to the
 pagan watergods it gradually became a 
 Christian festival we interveiwed a   
 lady from Hartington who told us a bit
 about the Well dressing. Hartington   
 wells dressing is about 6 years old.  
 The first Wells dressing started a    
 long time ago then interest faded.    
 Some people then decided it would be a
 good idea to start again. Wooden      
 boards are filled with locally dug    
 clay. An outline of the design is     
 placed on the clay and pricked out to 
 leave an outline is black knobbed to  
 make a definite outline. Petals,      
 grasses, seeds etc  are used to fill  
 in. The design is usually a religious 
 picture. When the picture is finished 
 it is put up near the well and        
 blessed.                              </content>
