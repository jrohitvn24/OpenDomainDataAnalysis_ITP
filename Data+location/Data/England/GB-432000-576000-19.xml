		<content>  In my view our village is the best on
 the north-east coast and has a history
 to be proud of,because in the 16, 17  
 and 18th centuries it was a major     
 seaport,exporting glass bottles, coal,
 copper and salt to all parts of       
 England and over to the Baltic states 
 of Europe. It also had engineering    
 works boat building, the Royal Hartley
 bottleworks and the salt pans. The    
 bottleworks had six cones. according  
 to the records3o,686 tons of coal,3OO 
 tons of salt and 1OO tons of copper   
 were exported each year. On may 2Oth  
 1872 the last ship sailed out called  
 the Liberty of Boston with a cargo of 
 bottles for the channel islands.
