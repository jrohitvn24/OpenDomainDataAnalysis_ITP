		<title>01An Outline Of Our Area</title>
		<content>   The land covering our twelve        
squares is flat.The soil is a          
mixture of chalk and clay.Most of the  
land is agricultural. Bedgrove is one  
of the largest housing estates in the  
United Kingdom,a part of which is in   
one of our squares.                    
   Nearby Halton has an RAF camp,with  
a small airfield used for gliders and  
training.                              
   About a mile away from Halton is    
Weston Turville village which dates    
back to Roman times.A further mile     
away is Aston Clinton,which also dates 
back to Roman times.The A41 which runs 
through Aston Clinton was a Roman road.
   Stoke Mandeville is still a village 
although its nearly becoming a suburb  
of Aylesbury,which is the nearby market
town.
