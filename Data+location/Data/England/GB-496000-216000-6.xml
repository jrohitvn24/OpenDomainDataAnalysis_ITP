		<content>The Church in Dagnall.There has been a 
chapel where people could worship for  
many years although the original       
Methodist chapel was pulled down when  
it became unsafe.The present priest has
lived in the village for nearly 60     
years and has been  preaching there    
for over 40 years.There are 4 Sunday   
School classes every week, a Sunday    
morning worship and Holy Communion     
every Sunday and Wednesday evening.The 
average congregation is between 70 and 
80, and 3 or 4 children are Christened 
every year.The chapel is the only place
of worship in Dagnall although some    
people in the village travel to        
Edlesborough\Eaton Bray to attend      
services there. The priest in Dagnall  
has the title:Sunday School            
Superintendant.
