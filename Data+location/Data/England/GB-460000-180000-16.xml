		<content>Most of our block is covered by        
farmland or forestry.The forests are   
not intensurely manage but they are    
generally worked.Trees planted and     
scrub cleared.The type of farming is   
predominently arable,only a couple of  
fields had cattle in.The mayjor crops  
are wheat and barley although a        
significant average of oil seed rape is
planted and harvested .The arable land 
is intensively farmed with reliance on 
chemicals in various sprays to promote 
growth and bill weeds.One small area is
used for market gardening and there is 
a small farm shop.Grassland is in      
the minority,mostly permenent pasture  
used for hay and grazing cattle,a      
little silage is also made.
