		<title>14ASDA SUPERSTORE IN TOTTON</title>
		<content>  The Asda Superstore in Totton was    
 opened in July 1983 by the chairman of
 the company and the youngest employee 
 a sixteen year old girl from Totton   
 College.                              
  The manager is Mr.F.Marra.The store  
 employs 300_320 people.There is a     
 national contest between retail       
 companies and a much smaller one      
 locally.                              
  The store was built in Totton because
 of the recent expansion such as the   
 housing developments and the Totton   
 Western By_Pass.The store covers a    
 large area of central Totton and many 
 houses were demolished to make way for
 it.                                   
  The store is a help to the community 
 because it brings trade to the smaller
 stores.The best selling item is       
 Mother's Pride Sliced loaf,the worst  
 was Remington's Pop_Corn maker.       </content>
