 In the reign of William the Conqueror 
 the bridge across the Ure was built   
 and soon the borough around the bridge
 grew up. In the 14th century the old  
 borough Aldborough and the new one    
 Boroughbridge had two members of      
 Parliament.They are now in Harrogate  
 constituency and Nidderdale rural     
 district.In 1322 the battle of        
 Boroughbridge between the Lancastrian 
 army and Edwards 11s supporters took  
 place.The battle was fought for       
 control of the bridge,held by the     
 Kings men, under the comand of Andrew 
 Harcla.
