		<content> One of our worst wrecks was at Donna  
 Nook on a terrible night with a force 
 10 gale. There were 22 people on board
 the ship and nearly all were          
 drowned.The worst job for a coast     
 guard is to find dead bodies just     
 lying on the beach motionless.We used 
 to have a lifeboat in Sutton which was
 kept where the Meridale Youth Club is 
 now.The coastguard service has been   
 gradually built up. High tides are    
 caused by a full moon pulling the tide
 inland.We get a veryhigh tide when    
 the sun helps the moon pull the tide  
 inland.Most people drown through going
 in the sea on airbeds or rubber       
 dinghys.
