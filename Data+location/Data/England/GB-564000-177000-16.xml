		<content>   Tilbury and East Tilbury are built  
 on the marshland flats which form part
 of the floodplain of the {River       
{Thames.}This accounts for the lack of 
 building there before this century.   
 People survived in isolated farms with
 "marsh fever" taking its toll of life.
  At Chadwell Hill and Gun Hill the    
 land rises to ten metres above sea    
 level and remains at that in the far  
 north of our survey.This makes a      
 flat,level landscape dotted by gravel 
 pits and housing.                     
  Because of drainage and modern       
 farming methods the lower land is now 
 devoted to arable farming _ mostly    
 wheat,barley and rape. Sheep are on   
 the hill and the higher flat lands are
 farmed again for crops.               
   There are many marshland            
 creatures,especially in the ditches.  
 Many horses are also kept here.       </content>
