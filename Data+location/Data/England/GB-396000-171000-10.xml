		<content>   There is a school and an old        
 people's home both called St.Dunstan, 
 in honour of that man.He was born in  
 909 A.D.and was a member of King      
 Edward's court.Later he became a      
 priest,and in 943 the King            
 commissioned him to restore monastic  
 life at Glastonbury.He refounded many 
 ancient abbeys,and was a principal    
 adviser to the Wessex kings.Eventually
 he was made Abbot of Glastonbury.     
   In 960 Dunstan became Archbishop of 
 Canterbury.The present Coronation Rite
 was compiled by him.He was also a     
 metal worker and bell founder,a scribe
 and draughtsman,and he played the     
 harp.In 978 Dunstan sat with the WITAN
 &lt;Council>at Calne.The floor of the    
 council chamber fell,and Dunstan was  
 the only uninjured survivor.He died in
 988.
