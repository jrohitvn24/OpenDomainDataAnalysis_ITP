		<content> The area forms a N-S valley through   
 which flows the{R.Arrow.}The older    
 buildings, some of the sites of which 
 date back to Domesday, can be found   
 along the{R.Arrow}on{Ipsley Hill}or   
 along {The Ridgeway.}                 
  Until the 1960's much of the area was
 farmland then Redditch was made a{New}
 Town. The area was developed from a   
{master plan}with{separate residential,
{industrial and recreational areas     
{linked by a graded road network.}Many 
 roads and estates take their name from
 the original farms in the area, such  
 as Woodrow Farm.                      
  In 1985{Redditch Borough Council}took
 over control of land and buildings    
 owned by the{Redditch New Town        
{Development Corporation.}             
  Many older residents regret the      
 changes but newcomers generally think 
 well of the New Town.                 </content>
