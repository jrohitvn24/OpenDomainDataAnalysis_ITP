		<content> We interviewed 34 old people in our   
 area.They said that{land use,transport
 and the{way of life}had changed in the
 past{50}years.{Farmland}has been built
 on.50 years ago there were no strikes 
 or school dinners.As there was no     
 school bus boys from{Portreath}had to 
 walk to{Illogan school}and they were  
 caned quite often.Boys and girls went 
 to separate schools.They used bicycles
 and fewer people had cars.They thought
 children are spoilt today but they    
 said the old days were better because 
 people were more friendly.One man went
 to Egypt in the war and another was in
 the{R.A.F}in{N.France.}Most thought   
 the war was worth fighting and there  
 were parties on{V.E}day.Everyone was  
 glad when the war was over.{
