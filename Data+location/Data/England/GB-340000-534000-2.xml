		<content> In Skelton and District many of the   
 children under 5 years of age go to   
 Playschool. This is a well organised  
 group that meets in the village hall. 
 After Playschool the children go on   
 to Primary School. They start when    
 they  are 4 years old and leave at age
 11.                                   
 After they have finished at Primary   
 School they go on to Secondary School 
 in Penrith, 7 miles from Skelton; they
 travel on a School Bus.               
 At the age of 13 they may transfer to 
 Grammar School or remain at           
 Comprehensive School.                 
 At 18 years of age they have a chance 
 of going to College or University,    
 this would entail travelling out of   
 the area. They may leave the Education
 system to start work at 16 years of   
 age.                                  
                                       </content>
