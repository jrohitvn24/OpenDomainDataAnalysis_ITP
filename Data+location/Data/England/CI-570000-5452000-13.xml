		<title>13POWER CABLE-LINK TO FRANCE</title>
		<content>    The French cable-link has been a   
 five-year project between France and  
 Jersey. (Jersey's total dependence    
 on oil for its electricity was felt to
 be unsatisfactory, as well as very    
 expensive). It is a combination       
 of a fifteen-mile underwater          
 power-line, produced in France, and   
 land-lines to the power stations at   
 each end. It comes into the Island at 
 Archirondel, at a building especially 
 built to receive it. A computer-      
 controlled satellie link between      
 France and Jersey is a necessary part 
 of the system.                        
    In May 1985 the power was switched 
 on in stages. There were three power- 
 cuts, due to a fault in the satellite 
 alarm system, which was found to be   
 over-sensitive. We are now receiving  
 half of our power from France during  
 the summer.                           </content>
