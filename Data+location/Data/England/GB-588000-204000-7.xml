		<title>07MUNDON - LIFE ON THE FARMS</title>
		<content> Although the people living on Fresh-  
 fields and Iltney farms are a little  
 remote they do not find this a real   
 problem.                              
   It is,of course,necessary to have at
 least two cars so that the wife can go
 shopping and ferry the children around
 while the husband attends to his      
 business.But this also applies to     
 anyone living in one of the outlying  
 villages because public transport is  
 so poor.                              
   To avoid the need to shop every day 
 freezers are used. Farmers are more   
 self-sufficient than many people since
 they can grow their own vegetables.   
   There are some minor problems. There
 is no refuse collection;no gas and no 
 newspapers delivered - but noone was  
 complaining.
