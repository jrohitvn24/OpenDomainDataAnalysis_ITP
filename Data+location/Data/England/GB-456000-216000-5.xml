		<title>05MERTON CHURCH</title>
		<content>The Church was rebuilt in 1379 at the  
time that King Richard II was on the   
throne.There are two sorts of windows, 
Perpendicular and Gothic.If you went   
back to the 1780s - 1790s  you would   
have found a spire. To get the money to
knock it down they sold the bells.     
That's why we don't hear bells on      
Sunday.In the Church is a Norman font  
which is 200years older than the       
Church. The roof was made higher       
in the 1480s.The timbers are 500years  
old.The pulpit was put in 300years     
later.St Swithin is the saint of the   
Church. There is a   stoup,sepelchre   
and redeliah.  All date from medieval  
times.The sedial is a group of three   
small seats especially for the priests.
The stoup is a special place where you 
get Holy Water to make the sign of the 
cross with.Buried in the Churchyard is 
the priest who buried Napolean.        </content>
