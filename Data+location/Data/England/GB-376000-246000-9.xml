		<content> In 1800 there were about 125 people   
 living in Malvern Link (the villages  
 of Upper Howsell, Lower Howsell and   
 Link).  By l881 there were over       
 4000.The people in the Link were      
 mostly servants to the people in Great
 Malvern who had come to live there    
 because of the "Water Cure".Stone from
 quarries on the North Hill was used   
 for building.Bricks were made from    
 local clay. There were seven          
 brickyards in Malvern Link.
