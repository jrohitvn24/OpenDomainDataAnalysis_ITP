		<title>08Stonegate Church</title>
		<content> Stonegate was originally part of the  
 ecclesiastical parish of Ticehurst.In 
 1838 the first church of St.Peter was 
 built in the northern end of the      
 present churchyard.In 1869 Stonegate  
 became a separate parish.By 1903 the  
 church building had developed alarming
 cracks and could not be repaired.The  
 present church was given by Mr.G.J.   
 Courthope of Whiligh and was          
 consecrated in 1904.For a short time  
 both churches were standing.          
 The parish of Stonegate has a         
 population of about 400,and nearly 100
 churchmembers.Stonegate is in the     
 Deanery of Rotherfield,the            
 Archdeaconry of Lewes and Hastings,and
 the Diocese of Chichester.We have our 
 own Parish Magazine with a monthly    
 circulation of 130.
