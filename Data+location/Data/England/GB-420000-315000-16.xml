  We had a cup of coffee,then Mr.Oliver
 and I went out on our appointments.   
{Where did you go and why?             
  The calls were on insurance matters. 
 We went to a poultry farm,an          
 agricultural contractor's,had a quick 
 bar lunch at the 'Middle Bell' Barton 
 under Needwood,then to survey a church
 that was being demolished and finally 
 to a haulage firm,arriving back at my 
 office at 16.30.

 competitors in the Sealink Cycle Race 
 went past.

  Mr.Oliver went home to Nottingham,I  
 quickly signed my post and went home  
 to change for another engagement.     
{What was this other engagement?
