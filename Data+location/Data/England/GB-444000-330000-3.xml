		<content> The pollution of the River Trent from 
 sewerage and industrial waste has     
 improved since 1975.   At Shardlow the
 River Trent is joined by the          
 relatively clean River Derwent which  
 will soon become the most highly      
 utilised water supply in the country. 
 On this stretch of water there are    
 flood defence works as it is very     
 prone to flooding and there is a River
 Analysis Height and Recording Station 
 for this purpose.   The Severn Trent  
 Water Authority  control effluent and 
 water quality, and in 1972 an         
 important abstraction point was       
 constructed at Church Wilne for the   
 Carbon Treatment of water to control  
 taste and odour.   The Church Wilne   
 Reservoir receives water from the     
 abstraction point.                    
 Gravel pits are worked for sand and   
 gravel extraction in this section.    </content>
