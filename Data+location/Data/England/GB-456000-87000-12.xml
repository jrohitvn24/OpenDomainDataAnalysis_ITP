		<title>12Kevin Smith at home</title>
		<content>   Kevin lives near Rowlands Farm in   
 Rowlands Lane.At the moment there are 
 only five houses in the area;there's  
 nobody else for miles.Kevin goes to   
 Ryde High School and is in the fifth  
 year.                                 
  He has a rather unusual hobby of fox 
 hunting,he also enjoys Table Tennis   
 and bicycle riding.                   
  He is not very keen on discos and    
 hardly ever goes out in the evening   
 because he lives so far away from the 
 town.He rarely goes to the mainland.  
 He enjoys living where he does because
 it is peaceful and quiet.             
  Some of Kevin's friends say that they
 have seen the Black Puma which is     
 supposed to be living wild on the     
 island.                               
  Kevin thinks that if you don't grow  
 up in the countryside you won't really
 like it.                              </content>
