		<title>04DAY IN LIFE OF Mrs MAUCHEL</title>
		<content> Mrs Mauchel is the Chairman of the    
 Horsham District Council. Mrs. Mauchel
 goes to the office where her secretary
 gives her any letters that have       
 arrived. The complaints are sent along
 to the appropriate department.        
 Sometimes she is home for lunch.      
 Occasionally she has to go to the Law 
 Courts to decide if someone is guilty 
 or not. They can pass a sentence of up
 to six months imprisonment or fines of
 up to Â£400. Mrs Mauchel is a part of  
 the Health Authority,  a family       
 practitioner, a conciliator, and a    
 Justice of the Peace. A conciliator   
 means that she tries to settle any    
 problems between a person and their   
 doctor on an informal basis.
