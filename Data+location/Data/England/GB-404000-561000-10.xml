		<title>10MY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> I live in a small village near        
 Mickley. Most of the houses are built 
 of stone. There is a post office and a
 pub called The Feathers Inn.  There   
 are farms in and around the village.  
 On the village green there is a red   
 telephone box.                        
 I go to Mickley School on a bus.

 I have lived in Mickley all my life.  
 It is a little village with two shops,
 a garden centre and a post office.    
 There is a football field with a bit  
 for children to play on.              
 There is an old school , an old church
 and two farms.
