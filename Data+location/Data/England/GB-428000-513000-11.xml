		<content>      {The Cleveland Bridge Company    
 moved to a new modern factory in 1983.
 Our dinner-lady's house overlooks the 
 gap left when the old factory was     
 pulled down and we asked her what     
 changes it has brought.               
{GH: }  My house is now much colder. We
 are spending more on heating.         
{ Are there any other changes?         
{GH:}   We now hear all the traffic    
 from Neasham Road.  We also hear the  
 railway trains more and the bells     
 from St John's Church.                
{ Is there anything you miss?          
{GH:}   The talk and laughter of the   
 men when they were going to work.     
{ What is going to happen to the empty 
{site?                                 
{GH:}   Old people's houses were to be 
 built but lead poison from paint was  
 found in the ground, and now the land 
 has to be left for 5 years.{  T.Baxter</content>
