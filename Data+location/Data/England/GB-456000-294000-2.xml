		<title>02COUNTESTHORPE - LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>     The countryside surrounding       
 Countesthorpe is quite flat and gently
 rolling,the highest point being about 
 300ft.                                
     The main crops consist of wheat,  
 barley and rape,but most fields are   
 used for pasturing cattle and sheep.  
     There are small farms scattered   
 around.                               
     Many fields show the old ridge and
 furrow patterns from the middle ages  
 strip farming.                        
     There are no woods and only a few 
 spinneys (for cover for foxes).       
     Having no rivers but numerous     
 streams fishing is restricted to      
 private ponds.                        
     Many footpaths lead through the   
 fields without damaging crops.        
     The fields have birds ranging     
 from sparrows to herons.              
     The countryside is superb.        </content>
