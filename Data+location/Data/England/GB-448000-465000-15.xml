  One of my favourite things is the    
 Roller Coaster at Scarborough.When    
 you get into the car you start to     
 feel as if someone is sticking a sword
 into your stomach. It sets off and    
 you go round a corner and up a steep  
 hill. When you get to the top you go  
 round a corner, straight down the hill
 and up, round and down again and so on
 until you get to the end.             
 My favourite playground game is chain 
 tig. For this game one person is on   
 and if he or she touches you,you have 
 to hold hands and if you or your      
 partner tigs or touches any one that  
 person would be on as well.When there 
 are four people on you split up into  
 pairs.Then there is a den this is a   
 rest place where the people who are on
 can't get you.You chase until every   
 one is caught,then a new game starts. </content>
