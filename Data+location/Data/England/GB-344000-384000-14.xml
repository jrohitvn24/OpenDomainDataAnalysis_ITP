		<title>14Family Life in Halewood.</title>
		<content>  Each member of a class of eight year 
 olds at the Church of England School  
 wre given a questionnaire to find out 
 about family life. Our families have  
 lived in our present homes on average 
 between six and eleven years. Most    
 families are settled in this area and 
 have no plans to leave Halewood. Asked
 why Halewood was chosen as a place to 
 live, three main reasons were given:  
 Nearness to grandparents or work and  
 the newness of the housing estates.   
  About half the childrens' families   
 have relatives also living in         
 Halewood. Most fathers are employed   
 and a small number of mothers have    
 jobs.                                 
  Although Ford's is a major industry  
 in Halewood few of our fathers worked 
 there. Most of the fathers were       
 professional or skilled manual workers
 whose jobs were outside Halewood.     </content>
