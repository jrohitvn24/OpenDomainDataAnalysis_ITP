		<title>11PRESS LETTERS HUNTINGDON.</title>
		<content> The majority of the letters were      
 either complaints or thankyous.       
 A disabled  man was left waiting 2    
 hours for a taxi in the high street.  
 When asked why he wasn't collected the
 taxi firm said " We are not allowed to
 pick people up in the high street".   
 Controversy has arisen over the       
 councils decision to ask the parents  
 of pupils at Hinchingbrooke school to 
 clean windows.Others, whilst agreeing 
 in theory to the plan think that the  
 issue was mishandled by the council.  
 Thanks has been expressed to the      
 staff at Hinchingbrooke hospital for  
 their efficiency.Complaints have been 
 received about the queues in car      
 parks.An alternative suggestion was   
 that payment be made on exit with an  
 automatic barrier installed for entry.
