		<title>12My Day.</title>
		<content>My mum usually wakes me at 7-30 a.m.   
I dress and for breakfast I have fruit 
n'fibre.After breakfast I wash,brush my
hair and teeth.I catch the school bus  
at 7-57.The bus arrives at school at   
8-50 and school starts at 9-00.We do   
some maths,handwriting,listening,art   
and English.For lunch to-day I had     
cheese flan,chips and beans followed by
apple sponge with custard.A lot of     
children bring packed lunch.In the     
dinner hour the girls skip,a game      
called under and over.The older boys   
play football.After lunch our class is 
joined by a younger class for assembly.
After silent reading I cooked with my  
group.We made treacle tart.            
  After cooking we had science then we 
put up our chairs,said prayers and     
returned home.At home I watched        
television then I had dinner.I changed 
and went to judo lessons.              </content>
