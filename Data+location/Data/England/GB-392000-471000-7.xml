		<title>07TRANSPORT IN LITTONDALE</title>
		<content>   There is only one bus service which 
 comes to Littondale.  This is the one 
 from Skipton to Buckden, which makes a
 detour to Arncliffe on a Monday and   
 Friday only.  The bus calls twice on  
 each of these days, once at about 9.30
 a.m. and again at about 1.30 p.m.     
 There is no other public transport    
 service to Littondale.                
   A school bus takes children to and  
 from the Primary School each day, and 
 continues downs to Grassington with   
 the secondary school children.        
   The main road runs up the south side
 of the Dale through Arncliffe, then on
 to Litton, Halton Gill and Foxup.  It 
 is an unclassified off-shoot of the   
 B6160, and it is joined at Arncliffe  
 by a single track road running up the 
 North side of the valley from the     
 B6160.  Single track roads leave the  
 Dale from Arncliffe and Halton Gill.  </content>
