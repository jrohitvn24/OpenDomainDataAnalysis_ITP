		<title>02Beverstone Castle.</title>
		<content> Beverstone Castle is privately owned  
 and it is not generally open to the   
 public.It stands in the centre of the 
 village between the church and the    
 A4135.The remains of the moat and the 
 west wing can be seen from the track  
 which runs from the main road to the  
 chourch.Incorporated into the eastern 
 section of the castle is a seventeenth
 century house which is the home of the
 owners.The castle was owned by the    
 Berkeley family for almost 500        
 years.It was completely rebuilt in    
 1220 and extended in 1360.The castle  
 was besieged twice during the Civil   
 War and was eventually captured by the
 Parliamentarians.Its military         
 importance declined after this and    
 ever since the castle has been used as
 a farmhouse.
