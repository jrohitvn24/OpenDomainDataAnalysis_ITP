		<title>03Interview with the Vicar</title>
		<content> We went to interview the Vicar of St. 
 Mary's church.  Here is some of the   
 information he gave us about the      
 church.                               
 Although he did not know how old the  
 church was, Rev. Goodwins said that   
 there is evidence of Christian worship
 on the site since 900AD.  The first   
 record of a church on the site was in 
 1186. The oldest gravestone in the    
 churchyard is dated 1724.  Each year  
 approximately 50 people are married in
 the church and about 6 people are     
 buried there. There are six bells in  
 the tower, but the vicar would like   
 two more as it would make a more      
 pleasant sound. The stocks by the     
 entrance to the church were made about
 200 years ago and are big enough for  
 three people to be locked up in them.
