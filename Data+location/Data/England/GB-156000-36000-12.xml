		<title>12A Typical Friday</title>
		<content> It is Friday morning 7 a.m. I jump out
 of bed and wash and dress.I have      
 breakfast and do my packlunch.I run   
 outside and climb the nearest tree.I  
 collect my schoolbag and walk to      
 school.I go into the school building  
 and line up for assembly.In assembly  
 we sing a hymn and our headmaster     
 talks to us.Then our teacher takes us 
 for English.English lasts until       
 10.30 a.m.After breaktime we have one 
 hour of maths.After maths we have our 
 dinner break.After dinner we do some  
 artwork.At half-past three we go      
 home.I hammer on my door.Mum lets me  
 in.I change into my jogging suit and  
 jog down to my grans.I have tea and   
 watch Tarzan.Then I go to guides until
 9 p.m.Then I do my knitting till      
 bedtime,9.30 p.m.I also like Fridays  
 because I can have a lie_in on        
 Saturdays.                            </content>
