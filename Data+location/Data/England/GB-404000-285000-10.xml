		<title>10GOVERNMENT ACTION</title>
		<content>Following a preliminary survey of      
matters of social and political concern
we took 15 ideas and asked our parents 
to choose which of the 15 they thought 
most urgently required Government      
action.130 responded and 30%,the most  
popular choice,thought that job        
creation was the most important task   
facing Government today.Next was give  
more help to poor countries and make   
stricter laws to control drugs.More    
than 10% chose banning nuclear weapons,
improving education and making         
immigration easier.Matters of less     
importance included improving old age  
pensions,Social Security payments,     
housing for the poor,and stricter laws 
to control crime.We wonder if and how  
this list may change from year to year 
and century to century.
