		<title>11WINDRUSH VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>  Coming into Windrush from Sherborne  
 there is a small building that is used
 as the village hall.                  
  The village hall is used for         
 jumble sales,about two or three times 
 a year.There are teas,cakes,biscuits, 
 raffles,toys and books for sale.The   
 money goes for the village hall when  
 it needs repairing.It was an old      
 school.You can tell because there's a 
 bell built into the wall of the       
 village hall.Two toilets and a        
 kitchen have been built after the     
 school was closed.When the school was 
 open the toilets were out side.The    
 village hall is built of Cotswold     
 stone and the roof is built of slates.
 The village hall is also used for     
 discos and childrens parties.
