		<content>   The motorway has been cut through a 
 hilly area.  It has passed through    
 many of the irregular fields in the   
 area.  Many farmers have been paid    
 compensation for loss of grazing land.
                                       
   The motorway passes close to a new  
 industrial estate. One of the         
 companies (Tetrosyl who make car      
 underseal) had to relocate to this    
 estate with a temporary loss of 350   
 jobs.                                 
                                       
    The M66 joins onto the trans-      
 Pennine M62 and enables many cars and 
 lorries to by-pass the town of Bury.  
 It has also helped the area to become 
 a commuter area for North Manchester, 
 bringing some much needed prosperity  
 to the area.
