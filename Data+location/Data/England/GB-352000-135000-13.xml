		<content> Baltonsborough Amateur Dramatic       
 Society was formed in May 1984        
 with 10 members. Now there are 27     
 members, 8 men and 19 women ranging   
 from 20 years to 66 years in age, each
 paying Â£2 membership per year and 50p 
 per session.                          
 Meetings are held every Monday night  
 at 7.45 pm in the church rooms.       
 There have been two very well support-
 ed productions so far:"The Snow Queen"
 and "Ring around the Moon". These have
 been held at the village hall.        
                                       
 A previous amateur dramatic group     
 called "Moonrakers" started but had   
 to disband in 1945 at the outbreak of 
 the Second World War.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
