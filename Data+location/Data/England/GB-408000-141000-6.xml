		<content> We enjoy a fairly stable climate in   
 our area and temperatures vary from   
 -10C in Winter to +80C during the     
 Summer months.                        
 Our weather is very mixed. Spring is  
 normally cool, wet and windy with some
 pleasant sunny days. The last two     
 Summers have been hot and dry, with   
 little rainfall, but this year has    
 been a wet cool one with plenty of    
 windy days. In contrast our Autumn has
 been warm, sunny and dry with little  
 or no rain. The first frost of        
 Winter came at the end of October     
 along with fog patches.               
 During the Winter, we normally expect 
 some snow to fall, and when heavy     
 falls occur, drifting snow off the    
 fields soon blocks off the roads, and 
 the area could be cut off for a few   
 days.                                 
                                       </content>
