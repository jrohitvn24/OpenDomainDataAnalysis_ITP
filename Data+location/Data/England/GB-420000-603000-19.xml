		<title>19Employment/Guyzance Area.</title>
		<content> Many of the people in the area are    
 employed on farms or in jobs          
 associated with farming eg.           
 agricultural engineers.Traditionally  
 farm workers were employed on a half- 
 yearly term basis,hirings being held  
 in May and November.It is still usual 
 for workers to change jobs at these   
 times although hiring fairs are no    
 longer held.Increased mechanisation   
 has meant that large farm units can   
 operate efficiently with fewer        
 workers.The redundant workers'        
 cottages have been sold or let to     
 retired workers or to tenants who find
 work outside the area.Some women are  
 employed as domestic workers in the   
 larger farm houses.People living in   
 the new development in the north east 
 sector tend to commute to their       
 professional ocupations.There is      
 little unemployment in the area.      </content>
