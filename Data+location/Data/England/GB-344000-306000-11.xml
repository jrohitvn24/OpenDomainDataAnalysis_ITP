    I wake up between 7.00 each morning
 .As soon as my alarm goes off I bolt  
 into the bathroom. After a quick      
 wash I go downstairs and eat my       
 breakfast before my sister Emma       
 comes.My mum comes down at 8.30.A     
 friend calls for me to walk to school 
 .On the way we munch our lunchtime    
 biscuits.We wait outside the gate     
 until a teacher comes out and signals 
 us to enter.Then we go on the         
 playground until its time to go into  
 school.In the morning we have maths.  
 Then after a shortish break "English".
 At lunch I eat my sandwiches and after
 lunch we have my favourite lesson     
 "Art".After a break we have games.    
 After school I watch T.V before I     
 have my tea.After that I go out and   
 play with my friends.I go to bed at   
 9.30pm.                               </content>
