		<title>06SADDLEWORTH CHURCH</title>
		<content> This was built about 1200AD, when such
 villages as Diggle did not exist. The 
 sparse population was concentrated in 
 small hillside hamlets such as Holly  
 Grove &amp; Pobgreen. By the end of the   
 Middle Ages, the church had become a  
 typical north-country perpendicular   
 parish church. Due to the increasing  
 population in the 18th century, inside
 galleries were built, &amp; in 1746 a     
 tower &amp; clock were added. Its state   
 deteriorated, &amp; in 1830 the church was
 repaired &amp; enlarged into today's form.
 Its rugged simplicity suits its bleak 
 moorland setting. There is an adjacent
 graveyard, in which is Bill o'Jacks   
 grave, &amp; also one over the main road. 
 It is the centre for old traditions   
 such as the rushcart festival, where a
 service is held each year after the   
 procession through the local villages.
 There are Church Walks on Whit Friday.</content>
