		<title>08MOULTON VILLAGE, GENERAL</title>
		<content>Moulton used to be part of Rockingham  
forest. It had some hunting lodges. In 
Norman times the timber castle of John 
Fitzjohn (1296) stood on high ground   
northwest of the church. Today this is 
known as Castle Field and a spring     
still runs there. An ancient Manor     
House stood on the site of Manor       
Farmhouse. Moulton Grange is built on  
what was monastic farmland. There used 
to be four stone quarries in the area  
all supplying Northamptonshire         
sandstone and ironstone for building.  
The population of the village is about 
4000 with the Parish of Moulton        
covering 2970 acres, situated within   
the District of Daventry. There are    
many village organisations, gardeners, 
history society, conservation, art etc,
all giving the village it's true       
spirit.
