		<title>07Streets:Leftwich &amp; Hartford</title>
		<content>   We surveyed and compared housing in 
 School Lane,Hartford and Old Hall,    
 Leftwich.  Houses in Hartford were    
 much older than Leftwich, being over  
 40 years old.  Houses in Leftwich     
 seemed to change hands much more      
 often.  The reason for moving house in
 both areas were mainly to do with     
 wanting a bigger house or getting     
 another job.                          
 Many people in Leftwich rented their  
 house but only two householders did so
 in Hartford.  In Hartford the houses  
 were generally detached, bigger and   
 with larger gardens.  In Leftwich they
 were mainly semi-detached or terraced.
 Few houses in Leftwich had garages,   
 unlike Hartford where several had     
 double garages.  Both areas had plenty
 of greenery - trees, verges and open  
 fields close by.
