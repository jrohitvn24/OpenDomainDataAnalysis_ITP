		<title>17Mr. Blackman &amp; the Dinosaur</title>
		<content>        Every year in Medstead school  
 we have a school fete and about ten   
 minutes after it starts a big dinosaur
 comes in to the school. It goes round 
 the school field giving people rides. 
 The dinosaur is orange with black     
 spots. Sometimes you have to guess the
 dinosaur's name or just have a go on  
 him. The most people that can go on   
 him is 15. Mr Blackman drives the     
 dinosaur.                             
                                       
        When the school had a Traction 
 Engine Rally the dinosaur came and    
 let people ride on him but the space  
 was smaller so the ride was shorter.  
 the dinosaur is a combine harvester   
 with the blades taken off and covered 
 with fibreglass and painted orange    
 with black spots. When it drives along
 the people cant't believe their eyes.
