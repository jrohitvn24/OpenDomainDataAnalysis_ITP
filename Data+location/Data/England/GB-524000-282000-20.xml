		<title>20THE D_PROJECT AT UPWOOD</title>
		<content>  This project was undertaken by the   
 3rd and 4th year children at Upwood   
 County Primary School during the      
 Summer Term, 1985. We made several    
 visits to the village and to          
 neighbouring farms. The people we     
 interviewed were all extremely helpful
 and very interested in the idea of the
 topic.                                
  Children who lived in the village saw
 things and found out about things they
 had never even heard of!              
  We have all thoroughly enjoyed the   
 Domesday Project and hope that whoever
 is reading this in whatever year will 
 find it all as interesting as we have.
  We don't know how you came to be     
 reading this_perhaps your great grand_
 parents told you about it. If so, that
 could be one of us_so look up the     
 school records and find out!
