 Sometimes A might choose one of them  
 which may be his, if so everybody     
 shouts 'you' and A has to catch the   
 ball.When somebody has 3 bad eggs they
 have to do a forfit.Now, let's look at
 something else. What should we look   
 at? Red Letter, that's pretty good. In
 Red Letter somebody is on.They choose 
 a letter which is the red letter.Let's
 say I was on and my red letter was    
 'T'.I would say a letter to the others
 maybe 'E'.Then the people who have an 
 'E' in their name take as many strides
 forward as they have 'E's in their    
 name.If I said 'T' nobody can move.   
 Oh! the whistle has just been blown   
 that must mean the end of             
 playtime.Must fly.
