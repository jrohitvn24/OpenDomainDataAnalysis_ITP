		<title>01 General Review</title>
		<content>The block includes much of the         
residential area of Stevenage New Town,
whose population is 78,000.The housing 
is mainly terraced and dates from 1951 
in the Monkswood area,to the Poplars   
which is still under construction.A    
large country park,Fairlands Valley,   
runs north-south through the           
residential area.It's main attractions 
are the three lakes,and the sailing    
centre.On the eastern fringes of the   
block there is open countryside which  
narrowly separates an expanding        
Stevenage from the village of          
Aston.The old village of Shephall is   
now surrounded by housing. In          
Stevenage, cycle ways keep bikes and   
mopeds separate from motor traffic on  
the main roads.There are small         
neighbourhood shopping centres,but the 
block is devoid of any major shopping  
or industrial centre.                  </content>
