My dad is a lorry driver.He gets up at 
5a.m.and gets changed.He has a cup of  
coffee and ten minutes later is driven 
to work by mum.He starts up his A reg. 
D.A.F.truck and looks at his notes.He  
is going to Slough to collect Mars     
Bars.He gets on to the M6 at about     
6a.m.and does a steady 55m.p.h.and     
curses all the people who think they   
own the middle lane.He listens to      
Radio One,it helps to keep him         
alert.He arrives at 10a.m.and backs    
into a bay.He goes to have his         
breakfast arrives back an hour         
later.He sets off  for home at         
2p.m.and arrives at Liverpool to       
unload at 6p.m.He drives back to       
Burscough and leaves the lorry  in the 
yard after filling up with diesel.He   
then goes home for tea at 6.30.
