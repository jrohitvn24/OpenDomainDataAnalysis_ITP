		<content>   The  main  feature  of the  farms is
 that they are becoming large complexes
 rather  than  remaining  small  family
 concerns.                             
                                       
   Due  to  changing  ownership of long
 established  farms,  few  old  village
 families  are  now  employed.  Workers
 come  from  as  far  away  as Reading,
 although  many  do live  locally or on
 the  farms  themselves.  Mechanization
 and intensive farming have in any case
 reduced  the number of jobs available.
 Four  appears  to be an average number
 of employees  with  two or  three more
 taken on as casual  labour at  harvest
 time.  Many ex-farm workers have found
 employment  in  the  car  factories at
 Cowley.
