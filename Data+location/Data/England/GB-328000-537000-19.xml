		<content> Farmers are concerned about sheep     
 worrying. During hard winters they    
 complain that after roads have been   
 cleared so that they can get to stock 
 sightseers come and re-block the      
 roads. Low-flying aircraft also       
 disturb stock but there is a compen-  
 sation scheme. Generally people are   
 unhappy about the reprocessing plant  
 at Sellafield from which the prevail- 
 ing winds could carry pollution. The  
 decision to move local television news
 coverage from Newcastle to Manchester 
 is regarded as an unwarrented         
 separation from the NE area with which
 there is a natural affinity. There is 
 local lobbying against the closure of 
 the Carlisle - Settle railway line.   
 The double layer of planning          
 permission (Allerdale District Council
 &amp; Lake District Planning Board) is a  
 source of irritation.                 </content>
