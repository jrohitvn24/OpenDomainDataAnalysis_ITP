		<content>   This is a{commuter area,}therefore a
 station is a very important part of   
 everyday life.Effingham and Horsley   
 stations were{first used between 1885}
{and 1890.}The busiest times are when  
 the commuters go to work between 8_9am
 and come home between 5_6.30pm.       
 Roughly 400-500 people use them       
 every day.At peak times the trains    
 come to the stations at 20 minute     
 intervals, apart from then they come  
 roughly every half hour.{90 trains  } 
{pass through in a day.}A typical day  
 for a driver is three 4 hour sessions 
 with a 45 minute break between each.  
   A fare to London at peak times costs
 Â£1.59 and at off peak times it costs  
 Â£1.30.{5-6 people work at both    }   
{stations}and they all feel that the   
 stations are situated in good areas.
