		<title>02The Great Northern Railway</title>
		<content> In 1850, the Great Northern Railway   
 (G.N.R.) opened its main line from    
 Maiden Lane, near the present terminus
 of Kings Cross in London to           
 Peterborough. The southern extension  
 to Kings Cross was opened in 1852. In 
 stages, the G.N.R entended and        
 reached Leeds and York, connecting    
 with the North Eastern Railway to give
 access to Newcastle and Edinburgh.    
 This is still one of the main lines in
 the British railway system.           
                                       
 The station at Sandy was opened in    
 1850 and, as well as offering easy    
 access to passengers to London allowed
 the local farmers and market gardeners
 the ability to easily send their      
 produce to large markets. The growth  
 of the market gardening in the area   
 owes much to the railway.
