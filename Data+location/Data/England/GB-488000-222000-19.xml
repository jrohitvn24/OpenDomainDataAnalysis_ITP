		<title>19A Middle School Morning</title>
		<content>    At 8.50a.m. the bell goes and      
 everybody hurries along the various   
 paths to their form rooms for         
 registration. Then we go to our first 
 lesson, today it is a library lesson. 
 The library is on the first floor and 
 overlooks the school driveway. It is  
 an N shape and has books on five of   
 the six walls. There is a wide variety
 of books. We have about 15 minutes to 
 choose a book and then we go and get  
 it stamped. Each of us has 2 tickets  
 to get the books out on. Each lesson  
 is 35 minutes long. Our next lesson is
 Maths, in which we are split up into  
 groups by our ability. After Maths we 
 have a 15 minute break, then we're off
 to our next lesson, double Games. In  
 the summer we play rounders, short    
 tennis,cricket(for boys) or athletics;
 in winter girls play netball and      
 hockey,while boys do football &amp; rugby.</content>
