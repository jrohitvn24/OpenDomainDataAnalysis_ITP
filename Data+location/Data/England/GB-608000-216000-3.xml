		<title>03The Police Station</title>
		<content> The old police station is in{         
{Ladysmith Avenue.}It is a red brick   
 building and was built in 1908. In    
 those days you could go to prison for 
 a day for stealing a chicken. Imagine 
 that!                                 
 The station has two cells for keeping 
 prisoners. Each cell had a peep hole, 
 a door with a flap, a window and an   
 old wooden bed. The window was the    
 only light in the cell. There was also
 an exercise yard for the prisoners    
 which is now filled with brambles.    
 Attached to the police station are    
 police houses. The{Sergeant}used to   
 live in one of these. There is also an
 old stable in which the{Inspector}kept
 his pony drawn trap. There is one main
 office from which the policemen work  
 which did not have much equipment.
