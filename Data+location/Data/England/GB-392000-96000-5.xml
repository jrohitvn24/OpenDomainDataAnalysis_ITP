		<title>05Natural Amenities Group</title>
		<content>    This group was formed in 1983 when 
 it was felt by some villagers of      
 Lytchett Matravers that the whole area
 was under{pressure from developers.}It
 was the wish of many inhabitants to   
 retain the{green belt}area.           
    A ring of{horse chestnut trees,}   
 probably 200 years old were felled    
 just north of the church. Woodlands   
 were sold and{tree preservation orders
 had to be confirmed.                  
    Two small{ponds}were in danger of  
 being filled in, although the one at  
 Rats Castle appears to have been      
 reprieved.                            
    The group continues to maintain    
 vigilance.
