		<content> Life is no longer governed by the     
 rhythm of the seasons.Harvest is no   
 longer the climax of the village year 
 since the anonymous combines and      
 'jumbo balers'sweep the vast fields   
 and mark up increased profits for the 
 multi-nationals.                      
 Dutch Elm disease in the late         
 '70's decimated the area of its finest
 trees and destroyed the habitat of    
 much wildlife.Even the surviving      
 wildlife is ravaged by the big-time   
 poachers who use the M5 for access and
 egress.Increased leisure time has     
 awakened the interest of the villages 
 in their assets and the footpaths are 
 determindly tramped by enthusiasts,   
 thus ensuring their survival.
