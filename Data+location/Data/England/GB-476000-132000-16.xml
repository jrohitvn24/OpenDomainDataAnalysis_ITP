		<content> At the Whitehill Club they play darts,
 pool, snooker and table tennis        
 in-doors. They play Cricket and lawn  
 bowls out-side. There is a newly made 
 bowling green with 4 rinks beside the 
 cricket pitch.                        
 We have a pub which is not very       
 popular.Most people have a drink      
 at the Whitehill Club.                
 Unlike other places we do not have a  
 park.There are two children's play    
 areas, with swings and see-saws.      
 The Golf Club which is the other side 
 of the village is about six square    
 miles in area. There are eighteen     
 holes on the golf course, which is the
 normal. It is good enough to be a     
 championship course.                  
 The village hall is used for evening  
 recreation for the community.
