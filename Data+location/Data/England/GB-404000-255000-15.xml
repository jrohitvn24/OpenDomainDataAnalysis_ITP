		<title>15 Mammals of the area</title>
		<content> Throughout the woods of the area are  
three different species of deer;fallow 
deer (a medium sized deer with a fawn  
coat with white spots.),roe deer and a 
small species introduced from the east,
the muntjac.                           
 Red foxes have earths throughout the  
area and are attractive but shy mammals
,considered pests in the surrounding   
pheasant woods,and so are persecuted.  
Another mammal in the area is the      
badger,whose setts can be found nearby.
 Bats are small insectiverous mammals  
which fly at night and also have very  
advanced sonar which they use to track 
down insects.Greater horseshoe         
bats,pipistrelle bats and noctule bats 
are found throughout the area. Yellow  
necked mice,wood mice,bank voles,common
voles,common shrews and pygmy          
shrews,represent the small rodents of  
the area.                              </content>
