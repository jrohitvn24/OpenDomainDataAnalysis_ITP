		<title>17Owning a horse</title>
		<content> If you want to own a horse the best   
 thing is to live in the country.At    
 least 27 horses are owned by people in
 the village.I own an Anglo-Arab called
 Hassann.To own a horse you need a     
 paddock of course,but in the winter   
 you need a stable with plenty of hay  
 and straw for the bedding and feed.I  
 also feed Hassann on a coarse mix of  
 flaked maize,oats,pony nuts and       
 vitamins.Sometimes he has a hot bran  
 mash.One of the less delightful jobs  
 of owning a horse is mucking out!It is
 AWFUL! And your pony needs mucking out
 every day before school.I keep mine in
 over night and turn him out in the    
 morning with a New Zealand Rug in the 
 winter.For the horse you need a saddle
 and bridle and you must have the      
 proper kit to ride in.If you keep your
 horse fit and healthy you can take it 
 to shows.                             </content>
