                 POISON                
                                       
To play poison you have 3 to 6         
children. One person has to hold out   
their hand and the others have to hold 
on to a finger. The person whose       
fingers they are holding starts to     
shout out some words. If they shout out
the word "Poison" then the children    
have to let go of their finger. If     
someone does not let go then they have 
the "Poison" and they have to hold out 
their hand.                            
This game can be played anywhere.
