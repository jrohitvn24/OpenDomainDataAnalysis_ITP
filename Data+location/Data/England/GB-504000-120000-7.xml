		<title>07ARUN CANAL; BRIDGES, LOCKS.</title>
		<content>  The Wey and Arun Canal Trust aims to 
 restore the canal for navigation by   
 small craft. Cooks bridge was restored
 some years ago. Work is in progress at
 two other sites on this stretch.      
  The old bridge at Toat is a typical  
 canal bridge but farm traffic used a  
 track across the canal bed upstream.  
 Trust volunteers, aided by the        
 Manpower Services Commission, have    
 built a new bridge,with sufficient    
 headroom for boats, in place of the   
 track: and a new spillway to allow    
 surplus water to drain to the river.  
  A mile to the north are the remains  
 of Middle or Lee Farm lock. Nearby,a  
 stream drained across the canal bed to
 the river. The Trust are in process of
 constructing a 100 feet long concrete 
 culvert for this stream which will    
 then run under the canal bed.
