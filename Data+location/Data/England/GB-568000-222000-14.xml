		<title>14  ANDREWS AIRFIELD</title>
		<content>   Andrews Airfield used to be an      
 American Air Base in the second world 
 war. It was named after Lieutenant    
 General Frank Andrews who was killed  
 in the war. The Airfield was closed at
 the end of the war in 1945 and turned 
 back into farmland.                   
   In 1972 a group of enthusiasts      
 formed Andrewsfield Flying Club. Now  
 the club has 200 members although not 
 all of them fly. There are about 30   
 planes there, 9 of which are club     
 planes.                               
   To help run the club there is a     
 trained engineer, office workers and 3
 full time flying instructors. The     
 planes they normally use for lessons  
 are Cessna 180s. Lessons cost Â£40 an  
 hour and it normally takes 40 hours to
 learn to fly. Before you can get your 
 pilots licence you have to pass four  
 written exams.                        </content>
