		<content>                                       
  Old Hardwick is typical of the many  
 dairy farms in the area. The farm     
 currently has 115 milking cows which  
 are a Friesan/Holstein cross which    
 give a better milk yield. The cows are
 milked twice daily, at 6am.and 3.30pm.
 They are milked at a rate of 60 an    
 hour and while milking is in progress 
 a computer allocates an individual    
 ration of food to each cow, depending 
 on it's needs. In the winter the cows 
 are all housed indoors in an open area
 rather than in pens.                  
  The farm has it's own nursery and    
 produces about 80 calves a year.      
 Heifer calves are kept for replacement
 stock while bull calves are sold at   
 market after 2 weeks. At present they 
 have a 10 month old bull which they   
 bred and are hoping to use as a       
 replacement.                          </content>
