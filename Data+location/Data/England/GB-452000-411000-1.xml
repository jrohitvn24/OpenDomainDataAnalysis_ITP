		<content>   This block was surveyed by the 2nd  
 Year pupils of Campsmount School,     
 Doncaster,a co-educational            
 comprehensive serving areas as far    
 afield as Smeaton and Thorpe-in-Balne,
 but mainly the villages of Askern,    
 Campsall and Norton.                  
   The survey reveals a largely rural  
 area and yet,typically of this part of
 South Yorkshire,the skyline is        
 dominated by coal-mine and coalite    
 plant,the fumes from which pervade the
 atmosphere.Our block includes only    
 part of Instoneville,the Askern pit   
 estate,but it is this community which 
 is reflected in our written text.     
   The area is lacking in amenities of 
 a commercial nature but some recent   
 effort has been made to utilise the   
 open spaces belonging to the Local    
 Authority to provide recreational     
 facilities for walking,fishing,games. </content>
