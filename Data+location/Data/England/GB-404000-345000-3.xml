		<content>  My name is Rachel Cope,I am ten years
old and live at home with my parents,  
elder brother Kevin and sister Sarah.  
I get up at about 7.00am, get dressed  
and have my breakfast. Then I pack my  
bag and go to school but first I take  
my big brother to college. When I get  
to Faber School I play with my friends 
and normally have a good day. When I   
get home I change into my old clothes. 
After tea I watch T.V for about an     
hour.Then I do  my homework ,go for a  
walk or play with my friend Claire.    
Sometimes I play on my own.I come in   
to the house about 8.00pm to watch     
more T.V until 8.30.Then I wash and    
undress for bed but sometimes come     
down stairs till 9.00pm.When I get to  
bed I occasionally read before going   
to sleep at about 9.15pm.I sleep very  
well normally except when the cat      
scratches at the window to come in.    </content>
