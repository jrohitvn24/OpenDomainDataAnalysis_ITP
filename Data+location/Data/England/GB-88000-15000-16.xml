		<content>{Mains Electricity on the "Off Islands"
   The Isles of Scilly are getting     
 mains electricity now because it is   
 expensive and inconvenient to produce 
 electricity with home generators.     
   There are four boats to do with the 
 cable laying .There is the{Gardiance  
 for laying the cable.The{Jubilance }is
 for carrying cargo from the mainland  
 to St.Mary's. There are{Crazy Diamond 
 and{Scavenger}too.                    
   They bring the cable ashore by      
 pulling it up with air bags tied to it
 and then they put concrete bags on top
 of the cable so that the boats'       
 anchors will not get hooked on it.    
   Between Bryher and Tresco the cable 
 is being laid next to the telephone   
 cable and most of the other cables are
 being laid in the same way. All the   
 power will come from the power station
 on St. Mary's.                        </content>
