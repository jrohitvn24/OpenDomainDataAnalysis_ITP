		<title>07RECREATION IN DEWSBURY</title>
		<content> In a survey of the general public,63% 
 thought that Dewsbury had far too few 
 entertainment opportunities, and 72%  
 thought there was not enought for     
 young people to do. This,too, after   
 the opening recently of a new sports  
 centre. Most thought the sports centre
 a good idea and 73% had actually      
 attended for swimming,badminton,squash
 and volleyball.Yet the majority of    
 people chose to pursue quieter or less
 organised activities in their leisure 
 time, like T.V., reading and walking. 
 Among children questioned, 45% said   
 they never attended clubs at all,and  
 39% said they never went on holiday,  
 these children being largely Asian.31%
 of all children attended the library  
 and other activities included Youth   
 Clubs,swimming,Cubs,Scouts,Brownies   
 and Guides.100% of houses have a TV,  
 half had 2 or more and 50% a video.   </content>
