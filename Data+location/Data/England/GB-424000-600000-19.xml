		<content>  Widdrington and Hadston are small    
 places and cater only for people's    
 basic needs. A big lack is the        
 provision of facilities fo recreation.
 The nearest Sports and Leisure Centre 
 is at Ashington, some ten miles away, 
 and the nearest cinema is at Morpeth, 
 about the same distance away. Public  
 transport by road to these places is  
 not very frequent and it is expensive.
 The only alternative is a car - for   
 those fortunate enough to have one.   
  The Working Men's Club at Widdrington
 provides recreation for adults and    
 occasional Discos for young people are
 held there. There is a weekly youth   
 club at Hadston. The nearby beach is  
 the only alternative for young people.
