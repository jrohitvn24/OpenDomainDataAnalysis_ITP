		<content> Since the National Park was first     
 opened many people from all over the  
 world have visited the area.The main  
 attraction of the area are the hills  
 and the river.Most of the visitors    
 come from SE Northumberland, many of  
 whom are regular visitors.There are   
 many easy footpaths for ramblers,in   
 fact there is evidence of over-use and
 erosion of some of the more popular   
 routes.Other popular stops include St 
 Michael's Church -which is usually    
 open,the information centre ,the river
 and the many Ancient British          
 settlements in the area.Very little   
 additional employment is produced in  
 the area from tourism.
