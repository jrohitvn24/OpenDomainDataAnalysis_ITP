		<title>07WIMBLEBALL RESERVOIR</title>
		<content> There was little opposition to the    
 building of the dam. The area that was
 flooded consisted mainly of poor      
 quaility farmland and the south end   
 was heavily wooded. There was no      
 compulsory purchase and the land that 
 was not required was resold. The local
 farmers were compensated and they also
 got the added bonus of paying guests  
 (bed and breakfast)                   
 The reservoir is 150 feet at its      
 deepest point which is at the dam.The 
 reservoir regularly fills to the      
 height of the dam in winter but there 
 is no danger of flooding because if   
 the water should top 150 feet it would
 just overflow part of the dam into the
 river. The lowest level that the water
 has ever fallen to is 23 feet.        
 The reservoir is fed by the River     
 Haddeo which enters it from the east  
 and the Withiel Florey stream .       </content>
