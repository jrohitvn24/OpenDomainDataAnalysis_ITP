		<title>01The Ousden area</title>
		<content> The largest part of this block is the 
 village of Ousden, with small parts of
 the parishes of Lidgate, Hargrabe,    
 Dalham and Wickhambrook in the county 
 of Suffolk. The whole area is farmed, 
 mainly grain, with just a few animals.
 The village of Ousden has a population
 of about 200, and is quite small with 
 the majority of houses being of       
 ribbon development on or near Ousden  
 Hill to the 'Fox' public house, then  
 turning left from the Fow down        
 Dunstall Green Road. There is just one
 block of houses named Rockall and this
 is owned by the council. The          
 countryside is very open and for      
 Suffolk quite high. The Fox is in fact
 the highest pub in the country at     
 400ft above sea level.
