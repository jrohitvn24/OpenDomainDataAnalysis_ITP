   The Bagnall area has located in it  
 three nurseries.                      
   These are open to the public for the
sale of garden facilities,such as      
garden  ornaments,shrubs,trees and     
especially,fir trees at Christmas.     
   The garden ornaments come in a wide 
range, from the popular garden gnomes  
to conical windmills.                  
   There are also many different       
varieties of shrubs and trees ,such as 
conifers.The nuseries are best known   
for the selling of fir trees at        
Christmas.Many of the plants are kept  
in greenhouses,as they need to be kept 
warm e.g Sunflowers and Conifers.Also  
available from the nurseries are garden
tools e.g forks,spades,hoes,etc.
