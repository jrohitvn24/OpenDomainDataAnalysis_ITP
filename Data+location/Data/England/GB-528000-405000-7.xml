		<title>07 A RESIDENTIAL HOME</title>
		<content>   Gilbert Sutcliffe Court is a        
 residential home for old people.A lady
 warden looks after the old people.They
 have a lounge where the old people    
 can sit and talk,play games like bingo
 or dominoes,or use the small library. 
 The lady showed us two lifts and some 
 stairs.The lifts are for the people   
 who cannot use the stairs easily or   
 who are in wheelchairs .There is a    
 guest room for visitors. Any rubbish  
 goes down a shute so dustbins do not  
 need emptying. There is a place for   
 ladies and gentlemens hairdressing and
 this doubles up with the T.V.room. The
 oldest lady in the home was 92 and    
 there are 32 flats all with old people
 in them.When old people are ill they  
 pull a cord which sets a alarm bell   
 off in the wardens office and outside 
 there room.There is always someone to 
 help them if they are ill.            </content>
