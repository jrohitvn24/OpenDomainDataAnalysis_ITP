		<title>15ST. THOMAS'S GUIDES</title>
		<content>Our guide troop meets every Friday at  
the chapel at 7.00pm.Our uniform in the
winter is trousers,blue shirt,green    
neckerchief,woggle and hat.In the      
summer we wear a blue skirt instead of 
trousers.We have to take our guide     
books and folders with us and any work 
we have done during the week.There are 
4 patrols called,Robins,Swallows,Blue- 
tits and Chaffinches and each patrol   
has it's own leader.We play games such 
as,Spinning the plate,where everyone   
sits on a chair in a circle.One person 
spins a plate on the floor in the      
centre of the circle,calls someones    
number out,and that person has to go to
the plate to keep it spinning.We also  
hold jumble sales and go camping at the
weekends.On some Fridays we cook.Whilst
we are in the guides we work for badges
of achievement.I enjoy the Guides.
