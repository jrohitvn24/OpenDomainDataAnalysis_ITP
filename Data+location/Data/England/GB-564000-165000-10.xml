		<title>10THE OLDEST HOUSE</title>
		<content> The oldest house is Luddesdown Court  
 by Luddesdown Church, it has Saxon    
 walls in a Norman building. It was    
 changed in Tudor times and since. On  
 the site  has been found the remains  
 of a burnt hut built of wattle and    
 clay along with fragments of pottery  
 made perhaps 5OO B.C.                 
 The residential area is not spreading,
 the newest houses are being built as  
 "in_fill".
