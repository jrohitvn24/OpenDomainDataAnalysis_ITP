		<title>01Summary of area as a whole</title>
		<content> Our study area is mainly rural in     
 character.There are two villages in   
 our area;Golden Green to the east and 
 Hadlow in the north east corner.To the
 west is the edge of Tonbridge which is
 the main urban development.There are a
 number of interesting and historic    
 buildings especially the castle and   
 church in Hadlow,and a number of farm 
 and oast houses in the surrounding    
 area.                                 
 The area has little industry being    
 mainly a farming area.Fruit farming is
 the most important,but the area also  
 has a dairy farm,nurseries,areas      
 devoted to hops and large areas of    
 grain crops.                          
 To the south runs the River Medway.   
 The river is a major recreational     
 resource,being used for canoeing,     
 pleasure boat cruising and fishing.Our
 area also has a beautiful golf course.</content>
