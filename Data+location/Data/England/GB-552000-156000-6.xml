		<title>06Harpsichords and Clavichords</title>
		<content>There is in Bradbourne Road a          
Harpsichord and Clavichord workshop.   
Two men work there making and repairing
these old-fashioned keyboard           
instruments.  The showroom is upstairs 
where there is one spinet and a few    
Harpichords.                           
One of the men has been working there  
for seven years.                       
The spinet sounds like a lute.  It is  
about the size of a small piano but    
smaller than a Harpsichord.  The       
Harpsichords are hand-painted by       
professionals and decorated mostly with
flowers.  The phrase {"Jack in the     
Box"} comes from the Harpsichord.  The 
Jack is the piece of wood that is      
shaped to pluck the strings by bobbing 
up and down.  The box is the casing of 
the strings.                           
Harpsichords cost between 1900 and 6000
pounds.                                </content>
