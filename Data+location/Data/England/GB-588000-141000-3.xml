		<title>03Smarden Land Use 1</title>
		<content> By far the greatest land use in this  
 area is agriculture. It is low lying  
 flat land of heavy Wealden clay,      
 interspersed with many ponds. Arable  
 use is always increasing, barley,     
 wheat, rape &amp; oats in that order are  
 the main crops. Planting is done in   
 the autumn whenever possible. The use 
 of large machines means that          
 unfortunately some hedges have to go  
 to make fields larger and easier to   
 manage. Cider orchards have nearly all
 gone and hops are on the decline. Hops
 are no longer picked by hand using    
 local labour, so unless the acreage is
 large enough for the installation of  
 heavy machinery they do not pay. There
 are 2 nurseries, several pick-your-own
 farms with soft fruit and vegetables  
 and a rabbit farm.
