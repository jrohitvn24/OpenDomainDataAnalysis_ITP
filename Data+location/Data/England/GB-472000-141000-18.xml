		<content> During the past few years oil         
 detecting machines have been taken all
 over our area which has been carefully
 surveyed for underground oil deposits.
                                       
 Although the oil to be mined is       
 somewhat north of our block, on sites 
 at Herriard and South Warnborough, the
 oil from these wells, when checked and
 treated, is to be piped underground   
 across the area to an{oil storage     
{terminal}between Holybourne and Mill  
 Court at Cuckoo's Corner on the dual  
 carriage-way.                         
                                       
 Work has commenced this year on the   
 digging out of the land to install the
 oil tanks, make{access roads}for      
 lorries to come and go and measures   
 have been taken to screen the terminal
 from the road.
