		<title>06Dry Stone Walling</title>
		<content>   Dry stone walls are a very          
 characteristic feature of the         
 Cotswold countryside. They surround   
 the fields on most of the farms.      
   The man who mends the walls and     
 builds them is a very skilled         
 craftsman. He was taught the craft    
 when he was a lad. He still treasures 
 the stone-cutting tool given to him   
 by the old man who taught him.        
   The stones have to be carefully     
 selected, balanced and laid because no
 mortar is used to hold them together. 
   He can build 2\ to 3 sq.m.per day   
 which involves moving by hand 6 tons  
 of stone.                             
   Dry stone walls are very expensive  
 because they are entirely made by hand
 but if they are well built they last  
 more than a hundred years.
