		<content>{Victoria Avenue}opened on 22nd June   
 1887 and is Jersey's only{dual        
{carriageway.}It runs west along the   
{Esplanade} following the old Jersey   
{Western Railway}route from the{Albert 
{Pier}to the little town of {St.Aubin.}
 At the {West Park}end of the Avenue is
 a granite pedestal topped by a crown  
 and inscribed{"Victoria Avenue 22 June
{1887".}The railings facing the Avenue 
 have, by law, to be painted black in  
 memory of {Queen Victoria.}Every year 
 an inspector checks it. Anybody with a
 different colour receives a heavy     
 fine.{First Tower.}At the time of the 
 French Revolution, Jersey built towers
 in its bays as defence. They were     
 called{Martello Towers}after a famous 
 one in Cape Martello in Corsica.They  
 had numbers, and the{first,}a mile    
 west of the town has given its name to
 the area around it.                   </content>
