		<title>17Caldecote Church</title>
		<content> Caldecote Church is not used any more 
 because it is not in very good        
 condition.However some years ago the  
 pews were taken out and given         
 to Folksworth Church because they were
 in better order.When we went to this  
 church we did not go inside.We        
 sketched the outside and looked at the
 views around it.The outside of the    
 church was over grown with trees and  
 bushes.From a distance you cannot see 
 the church.To get to the church you   
 have to go up a very narrow road.This 
 road leads to a farm.
