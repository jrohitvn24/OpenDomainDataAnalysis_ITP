		<title>05Ecology-Pamber Forest (ctd.)</title>
		<content> Notably such plants as the 'Early     
 Purple Orchid' and the 'Moschatel'.   
    Pamber Forest is coppiced woodland,
 mainly hazel coppice (or stools as    
 they are known locally) with oak      
 standard.It has been 25 years since   
 the last major coppicing and it is    
 only over the last 2 years that       
 coppicing has been reintroduced.      
    It is proposed that approximately  
 300, 80 to 100 year old oaks are to be
 felled to widen the forest rides.     
 Reasons:(i)to increase the diversity  
 of flora and fauna along the edge of  
 these rides.(ii)to give more growth   
 room to some of the existing oaks.    
{Flora and Fauna.                      
    Pamber Forest contains a wealth of 
 plant and animal life.The following   
 have come from our own observations   
 and details given to us by the warden.
