		<title>19Fishing _ near Fetcham.</title>
		<content>    On the River Mole near Fetcham     
 there are lots of places to fish, e.g.
 "The Splash" off River Lane. The fish 
 you can catch include trout, chub,    
 roach, rudd, tench, bream and gudgeon.
 Maggots and bread are usually use as  
 bait. The best techniques to use are  
 float fishing and ledgering.          
     There is a fishing club called the
 Leatherhead District Angling Society  
 which controls most of the river in   
 the Leatherhead area. Rods cost from  
 10 to 100 pounds. The local fishing   
 shop (Aburns of Ashtead) is now       
 closing down so you have to go to     
 Tompkins of Dorking  for fishing      
 gear.                                 
    Fishing may appear to be very      
 boring but in fact is extremely       
 interesting. It is a very good hobby.
