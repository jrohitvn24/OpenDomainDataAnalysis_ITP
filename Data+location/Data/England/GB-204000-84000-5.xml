{   Our weather(2).}By Rachel Davey.   
             {WIND.                    
    In Delabole we always have a bit of
 wind even if only a breeze.Most of the
 time its SW or NW.We only have        
 easterly winds in the Winter and      
 Spring.Through the years we have had  
 14 days in 1981 with gail force,10    
 days in 1982,13 days in 1983 and 13   
 days in 1984.So the Average number of 
 days we have gail force winds each    
 year is 10 days. We do have quite a   
 few days with{sea mist,}because we are
 near the coast and high up.           
          {RAIN.                       
 We have rain every month in Delabole. 
 We have had a dry summer for the last 
 two years.The average rain for a year 
 is 183 cm.In a year for an average it 
 is  164 days with some rain.
