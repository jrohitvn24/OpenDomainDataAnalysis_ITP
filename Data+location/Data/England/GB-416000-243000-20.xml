		<title>20Flowers and Birds Mickleton</title>
		<content> Dog's mercury and violets are early in
 flower on hedgebanks and in woods,soon
 followed by primrose and bluebell.    
 Ladies smock,stitchwort,campions come 
 in season.In some places orchids still
 grow.Meadow cranesbill turns the road-
 side verges blue.Ladies bedstraw and  
 willow herbs mark the turn of Summer. 
  Resident birds are joined in Winter  
 by migrant fieldfare and redwing      
 stripping gardens of berries.The sis- 
 kin is bright feeding in birches.Warb-
 lers,martins,skylarks and their       
 companions of hill and vale still find
 a nesting place.
