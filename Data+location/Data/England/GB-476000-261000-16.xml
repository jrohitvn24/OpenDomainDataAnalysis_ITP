		<title>16 EMPLOYMENT IN NORTHAMPTON</title>
		<content>In days such as these, Northampton is  
not without its unemployment problem   
with figures surging into the nine     
thousands. Northampton became part of a
development scheme in the late l960's  
and since then has attracted many      
people from London's overspill, which  
has meant that more jobs had to be     
created and this is why places like    
Brackmills and Moulton Park came into  
being.These areas contain large firms  
like Telfers and M.F.I. Such firms need
an increasing number of staff, thus    
helping to serve Northampton's         
employment requirements. The signs are 
therefore very encouraging in          
Northampton with its large supermarkets
shopping centres and industrial estates
providing much needed employment.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
