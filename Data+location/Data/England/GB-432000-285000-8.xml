		<title>08EDUCATION IN BEDWORTH</title>
		<content> Education is provided in{FIRST SCHOOLS
 (5-8yrs){MIDDLE SCHOOLS}(8-12yrs) &amp; { 
{COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS}(12-16yrs).Above
 this age there are other full time    
 educational opportunities in Bedworth 
 &amp; Nuneaton.There are no comprehensive 
 schools or beyond,in our area.        
  Of interest is the number of church  
 schools still in Bedworth.The Rev.    
 Nicholas Chamberlaine (Bedworth Rector
 1660-1715)died a rich man.He left his 
 money to endow schools &amp; a hospital   
 (now the Almshouses).The five church  
 schools open are Canon Maggs Middle   
 School,Canon Evans First School, Hob  
 Lane First School,Henry Bellairs      
 Middle School &amp; Bulkington Lane       
 First School.Money from the endowment 
 is still regularly granted for such   
 things as purchasing computers &amp; the  
 building of a vandal-proof store to   
 protect school textbooks.             </content>
