  Although there are many activities   
which have to be sought outside the    
area, Madeley does provide the         
population with a variety of recre-    
ational pursuits.  {Clubs and courses  
for children} Brownies, cubs and       
scouts meet in the village schools. A  
pre-school play group is held in the   
village hall. The hall is also used in 
conjunction with the comprehensive     
school to provide venues for youth     
clubs and discos.                      
  There is a swimming pool at Madeley  
College which is open to the public at 
certain times.                         
  'Lads and Dads' football games take  
place at the Manor Road football       
ground. There is also a BMX track pro- 
vided, and quite a number of children  
go fishing at Madeley Pool.
