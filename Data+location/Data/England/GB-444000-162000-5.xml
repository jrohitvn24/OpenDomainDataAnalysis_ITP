		<content>     I usually wake at about 6 0'clock,
 turn over and carry on snoring.At     
 6.45, my alarm goes and I grope around
 knocking my watch onto the floor.I    
 eventually find the knob but by that  
 time the alarm has stopped ringing.I  
 try and get my head brace out of my   
 mouth and slowly walk down stairs to  
 do piano practice for half an hour.   
 Most of the time I am half asleep.I   
 play the nice tunes at least twice    
 because then I don't have time to play
 the horrid ones.Then I go upstairs,   
 get dressed And try vainly to get the 
 knots out of my hair. At breakfast I  
 spill sloe jam all down my school     
 skirt and get it sopping wet trying to
 get it off.Next I go upstairs to clean
 my teeth,put my headbrace on and rush 
 downstairs as Mrs.Bayliss arrives.    
      I get into school and put my     
 homework books onto the piles.P.T.O.  </content>
