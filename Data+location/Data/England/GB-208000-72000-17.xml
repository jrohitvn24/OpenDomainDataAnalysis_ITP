		<content>     Much of the farmland around       
 Blisland is divided into small fields 
 by hedges. The local hedges are built 
 of two stone walls with earth between 
 the stones and between the walls. A   
 hedge may be two metres thick at      
 ground level.                         
     A new hedge is soon colonised by  
 plants and wildlife. Older hedges are 
 inhabited by insects, small mammals,  
 birds, wildflowers, bushes and even   
 trees.                                
      The hedges were probably built   
 with stone from a nearby quarry or    
 with stones picked up to clear the    
 field.                                
     Hedges have many values; they form
 boundaries between farms, keep        
 livestock in _or out of_ a field, and 
 provide animals with shelter and      
 shade.
