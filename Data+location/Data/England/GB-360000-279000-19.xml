		<title>19RECREATION. PIGEONS.</title>
		<content> My Dad races{Homing pigeons.}Every    
 week from April to September he races 
 them. A man in the village near us    
 also races them. Another man          
 keeps some but does not race them.    
     The pigeons eat wheat, barley,    
 maize, peas, beans, millet and        
 "Homoform". On a night we take our    
 pigeons up to the the pub where we    
 basket them. When we basket pigeons we
 put a rubber ring on the pigeons leg. 
 When they have raced back we put the  
 rubbers in a special clock. Then at   
 8pm the clock is struck and Mum, the  
 Club secretary, works out the placings
 for the race. We have about 20        
 members. On Wednesdays we basket the  
 pigeons to go to Saintes in France, on
 Thursdays for Nantes, Cherbourg,      
 Rennes in France and on Fridays to    
 Swainswick, Weymouth, Wincanton,      
 Exmouth, Plymouth and Penzance.       </content>
