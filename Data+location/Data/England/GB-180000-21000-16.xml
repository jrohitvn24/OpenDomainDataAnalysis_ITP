 The Three Tuns gets its name from 3   
 tonnes of wine which were taken from a
 French shipwreck by a 'wrecker'.  It  
 is situated in the square between the 
 church and a shop. It was rebuilt in  
 1910 with local stone.  The White     
 Hart,which forms one side of the      
 square, was converted from thatched   
 cottages in 1700 and became a coaching
 inn that housed 2 horse buses.  The   
 famous tenor singer, Charles Ingledon,
 was born there in 1750.  He sang      
 before royalty all over the world.    
 The pub has a collection of horse     
 brasses and old photos of St. Keverne.
 The Five Pilchards, in Porthallow, has
 a remarkable collection of artefacts  
 from shipwrecks and many photographs  
 of this small fishing village taken   
 at the turn of the century.
