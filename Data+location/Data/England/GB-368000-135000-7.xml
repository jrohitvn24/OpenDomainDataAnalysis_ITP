		<content> We interviewed a local farmer about   
 farming life.His working hours are    
 from 6:ooam to 9:oopm in the summer   
 and 6:ooam to 6:30pm in the winter.   
      He was born and brought up on his
 farm and has worked there all his     
 life.His farm covers 250 acres        
 altogether.He has been a farmer for   
 twenty years and most of his family   
 help him.                             
 His wife does the accounts and        
 also looks after the chickens.        
      He says that the farm is "older  
 than the hills"(which means one of the
 oldest in the area).                  
      He keeps lots of different types 
 of animals including                  
 cows,sheep,chickens and goats.        
      Most of his land is intensively  
 managed and is used for pasture or for
 cutting as grass,silage or hay.
