		<title>06TADWORTH COURT HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>{   Tadworth Court}is a 17th century   
 brick mansion. Together with the outer
 buildings built in the 1920's they    
 form the Tadworth Court Children's    
 Hospital.                             
    The hospital was due to be closed  
 but has been kept open through the    
{concern of the parents}who fought hard
 to have it kept open. They raised a   
 lot of{badly needed money}by selling  
 off part of their land. Over 250      
 houses are going to be built on this  
 land.                                 
    The hospital can take{56 patients. 
 Most of the children are cared for at 
 home and come into the hospital to    
 give their parents a break in which   
 they can renew their strength to      
 continue looking after them.
