		<content> The main industry in the area is      
{coal-mining}there are many pits around
 Wath and Brampton.One of the main pits
 is Cortonwood.As a child described the
 Cortonwood mine,"I found it dusty and 
 horrible.We visited the rescue room   
 and the medical room.We then went into
 the explosive room after we had been  
 searched for cigarettes and matches.We
 also saw the winding gear.The wheel   
 bringing up the coal went twice as    
 fast as the one bringing up the men." 
 Mining in the area is now on the      
 decline,with alot of the seams being  
 worked out.A large coking plant to the
 east of Wath was closed down a few    
 years ago-which hsan't helped the coal
 industry in the area.
