		<content>{THE ROYAL ALBERT}TRAIN BRIDGE ACROSS  
 THE{TAMAR}WAS DESIGNED BY THE FAMOUS  
 ENGINEER ISAMBARD KINGDOM{BRUNEL}AND  
 COST Â£230,000 TO BUILD. WORK STARTED  
 IN ABOUT 1855 AND IT WAS OPENED BY    
{PRINCE ALBERT}ON 2ND MAY 1859 WHEN THE
 LARGEST CROWD EVER SEEN IN SALTASH    
 WATCHED THE OPENING CEREMONY. THE     
 FIRST TRAIN CROSSED THE BRIDGE ON 12TH
 APRIL 1859.                           
 IT IS 690M LONG WITH ITS GREATEST SPAN
 BEING 140M. THE BRIDGE RUNS 46M ABOVE 
 HIGH WATER LEVEL. IT WAS WORLD FAMOUS 
 BECAUSE IT WAS THE LONGEST SUSPENSION 
 BRIDGE EVER BUILT AT THAT TIME.       
 IN MEMORY OF BRUNEL THE PEOPLE OF     
 SALTASH ERECTED A BUST OVERLOOKING THE
 BRIDGE WHICH WAS HIS LAST MASTERPIECE.
