		<title>20Commemoration of the Project</title>
		<content>   On completing the Domesday Project  
 we wondered how we could commemorate  
 it. Mrs Jane Bird, propogator at      
 Tresco Abbey Gardens, offered school a
 horse chestnut tree that she had grown
 from a conker. This was it!           
   And so a large and carefully        
 prepared hole was dug.                
   The tree{Aesculus Hippocastanea}    
 grown from a seed collected in Kew    
 Gardens in October 1980 and grown on  
 at Tresco Abbey Gardens by Mrs Bird,  
 was planted between the School and    
 School House by Mr.Kenneth            
 Christopher, Manager of Tresco Estate 
 and Island Councillor, during the     
 annual visit of members of the        
 Education Committee of the Isles of   
 Scilly Council.                       
   We hope that in years to come the   
 tree will give shelter and delight to 
 all  islanders and visitors alike.    </content>
