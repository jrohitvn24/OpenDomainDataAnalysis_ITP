		<title>20Bryanston Recreation</title>
		<content>   Increased leisure seems a feature of
 this part of the 20th century. Health 
 &amp; fitness are the current fashions.   
  {The Sports Centre}at Bryanston has a
 25m swimming pool,used by pupils,staff
 &amp; families, Blandford Swimming Club, &amp;
 local schools. 2 squash courts, also  
 used by a local club, a weight room &amp; 
 gym are in demand &amp; a{new Sports Hall}
 be added by the autumn.               
   Other activities take people further
 away: sailing in Poole (boardsailing  
 is fashionable),riding,rifle shooting.
   Opportunities for "jogging" are more
 or less unlimited,though its appeal is
 diminishing.It is infinitely better to
 walk in the area &amp; enjoy the scenery.
