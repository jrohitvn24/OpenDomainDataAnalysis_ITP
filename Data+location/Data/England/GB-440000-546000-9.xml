		<content> IN MARCH 1984 MINERS FROM ALL         
 OVER THE COUNTRY BEGAN A STRIKE OVER  
 PLANNED CLOSURES OF COLLIERIES AND    
 LOSS OF JOBS.IT WAS A BITTER STRUGGLE 
 WHICH LASTED FOR ALMOST A YEAR.MANY   
 MINERS FROM SEAHAM WENT BACK TO WORK  
 AND TEMPERS RAN EXTREMELY HIGH.SOME   
 WORKING MINERS HAD THEIR WINDOWS      
 BROKEN BY STRIKING MINERS.THERE WERE  
 SOMETIMES AS MANY AS 1000 PICKETS AT  
 THE SEAHAM COLLIERIES.THEY LAID GLASS 
 IN THE ROAD TO HAMPER TRANSPORT.THE   
 WORKING MINERS WERE TAKEN TO WORK IN  
 BUSES THAT HAD THEIR WINDOWS COVERED  
 WITH WIRE MESH.THE DRIVERS COVERED    
 THEIR FACES SO AS NOT TO BE           
 RECOGNISED.STRIKERS HAD NO MONEY.     
 CHRISTMAS PRESENTS FOR CHILDREN WERE  
 DONATED BY OTHER GROUPS AND CLUBS.WHEN
 IT WAS ALL OVER THE MEN RETURNED TO   
 WORK BUT THERE WAS MUCH BAD FEELING   
 BETWEEN THE TWO SETS OF PEOPLE.       </content>
