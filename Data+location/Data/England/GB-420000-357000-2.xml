		<title>02The Hamlet of Aldwark.</title>
		<content> Aldwark hamlet is situated in the SW  
 of the area, and is the only          
 concentration of population in the    
 area.                                 
                                       
 The hamlet consists of five dairy     
 farms and two cottages with no land.  
 The land is held by old-established   
 farming families, the farms being     
 passed down from generation to        
 generation.                           
 At the time of the survey, the former 
 public house, the "Bull's Head", was  
 being converted into a dwelling by the
 recently married daughter and son-in- 
 law of a farmer in the hamlet,because 
 they wished to remain in the          
 area.During the conversion the couple 
 are living in a caravan on the site.  
 Most people in the area are           
 middle-aged, and only one family has  
 children of school age and younger.   </content>
