		<content>It was proposed by the Nature          
Conservany Council to designate areas  
of parkland and woodland belonging to  
Whittlewood Forest as sites of         
Special Scientific Interest.  The broad
-leaved woods between Whittlebury and  
Potterspury are the most extensive,    
least-changed remnants of the once vast
Crown coppices of Whittlewood Forest.  
They form a group of ancient           
semi-natural woodlands dating from     
the middle ages and earlier, typical of
the midland  clays.  The variety of    
trees included are Oak, Ash, Silver    
Birch, Aspen and Elm.  There is        
characteristic and diverse flora and   
fauna, including rare and uncommon     
species.  The bird community includes  
species such as Woodcock, Redstart,    
Sparrow-hawk, Nuthatch, Green          
Woodpecker and Nightingale.
