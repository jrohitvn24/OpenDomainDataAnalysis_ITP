		<content> The B1193 is the new name given to the
 road between Epping and Harlow. Mail  
 coaches used this route, changing     
 horses in Harlow and baiting (eating  
 and resting) at Hockerill.Royal       
 interest in racing led to its improve 
 ment as a route to Newmarket,but even 
 in the 1950s it was a slow route with 
 bends around every farm boundary.In   
 the 1960s after straightening it took 
 heavy trunk road traffic till the M11 
 was opened.It is still heavily used.  
 The small roads to Rye Hill and Epping
 Upland follow old boundaries-the age  
 of the hedges bears this out.The one  
 straight part,over the common,is "used
 like a race track" despite its narrow 
 blind hill-crests,according to a local
 policeman.                            
 The M11 glances through the area in a 
 cutting,with little traffic noise,and 
 has removed much heavy through traffic</content>
