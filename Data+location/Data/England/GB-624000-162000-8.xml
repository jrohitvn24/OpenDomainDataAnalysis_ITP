 be found at Stourmouth were discovered
 in 1960 when a trench was cut for a   
 water main. Flint tools and pottery   
 dating from the{Neolithic}period came 
 to light. In 1965 a{hoard}of 49       
 objects buried by someone in the late{
{Bronze Age}where found, there were    
 axes, socketed chisels and fragments  
 of sword blades. The oldest part of   
 the Church at Stourmouth is thought to
 be late Saxon, and built about 1000   
 AD. In the church is a monumental     
 brass to a Rector Master Thomas       
 Mareys buried in 1492. There are many 
 wills on record to show that          
 Stourmouth was a prosperous place in  
 Medieval times with well to do Yeoman 
 Farmers. Some of the same names appear
 again on the Georgian headstone in the
 churchyard.
