		<title>15MARY DENDY HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> There are 350 staff. 230 are nurses   
 and the rest are cooks, gardeners etc.
 Most of the staff do not live on the  
 site.                                 
    At one time the wards held 50-60   
 patients. Now they are small          
 dormitories of up to 15. Each patient 
 has a small private area with bed,    
 wardrobe and desk, and curtains round.
 They can play their own radios and be 
 alone. There are special bathrooms    
 with baths which can be tilted to make
 it easy to get in to from a wheel     
 chair. Each bath costs Â£2000.There is 
 also a day room for each unit with    
 chairs, tables and a television, that 
 patients are free to use as they wish.
 There are lots of activities at the   
 home. There are workshops where some  
 of the patients earn money making     
 paper party novelties,plastic garden  
 gnomes and wooden key-rings.          </content>
