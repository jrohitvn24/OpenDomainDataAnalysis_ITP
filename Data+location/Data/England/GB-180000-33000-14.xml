		<title>14MARINE ECOLOGY SURVEY 1985</title>
		<content>     Ecological studies  were carried  
 out on two beaches in Flushing, Little
 Falmouth Beach and Kiln Beach. The    
 amount of life on each beach was      
 compared at low tide.Brown seaweeds   
 (especially Bladder Wrack) were found 
 to be commonest on both beaches with  
 only small amounts of red or green.   
 Little Falmouth Beach had more animal 
 life present,being a muddy shore with 
 large rocks.Kiln Beach was sandier.   
 The commonest animals on both beaches 
 were sandhoppers: approx.135 found on 
 25 sq.metres on Little Falmouth Beach 
 and 65 on Kiln Beach.       {         
     Pollution: There was little       
 pollution except for broken glass and 
 litter. There was more litter on Kiln 
 Beach compared to Little Falmouth     
 Beach.
