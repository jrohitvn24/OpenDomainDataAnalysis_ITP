		<title>16A Bypass for Braintree.</title>
		<content>    The town of Braintree in Essex is  
 badly in need of a bypass. This is    
 due to the traffic of 1985 passing    
 through the town en route from the    
 M.11 motorway to the east coast ports.
    For many years planners have argued
 about the route and the cost of the   
 bypass. It has now however been agreed
 to route the new road around the      
 south of the residential area joining 
 Rayne Road to London Road, before     
 joining Coggeshall Road, thus creating
 a West to East link.                  
    Eventually another part will join  
 Coggeshall Road to the A131 giving a  
 complete new road system.             
    Building of the first stage will   
 begin in 1986 with the second phase   
 commencing in 1987. It should be fully
 complete in 1989. Part of this road   
 construction will be dual carrageway.
