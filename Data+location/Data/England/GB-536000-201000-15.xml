Tesco's,which is at the Old Pond next  
to Barclays Bank.Brookfield Farm       
Tesco's sell their own goods such as   
bread and cakes,which are quite cheap. 
 In schools they sell roast dinners,   
salads and junk food like hamburgers,  
hot dogs and chips.In junior and       
infant  schools dinners cost 66p a day 
which is 3.30 pounds a week.
