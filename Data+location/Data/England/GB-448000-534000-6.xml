		<title>06THE WORKMANS CLUB.</title>
		<content> The workmen's club in King Oswy Drive 
 has four rooms.It has a bar,two       
 lounges, and a snooker room. They have
 a stage with a set of drums and a     
 piano. A group plays every Sunday     
 night. The bar has a pool table and a 
 dartboard. To play pool you sign your 
 initials on the blackboard and wait   
 until it is your turn. Then you put   
 your money in and the balls arrive    
 down a chute. If you win you stay on  
 and play the next person. You stay on 
 until you get beat. Women can't come  
 in the bar because it is for men only.
 There is a television for them. The   
 snooker room has two twelve foot      
 tables. The cellar is the place where 
 the beer is kept. My dad takes me in  
 sometimes on a Sunday dinner time. On 
 Wednesday they have comittee meetings.
