		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> This block contains a landscape of    
 contrasts,between the coniferous      
 forests of the Haldon Hills ridge and 
 the pasture and arable landscape      
 developed on the red permian rocks on 
 the west side of the river Exe.       
 The Haldon Hill ridge consists of     
 upper Grensand rocks,on which are     
 developed relatively poor             
 soils.Formerly part of the Mamhead    
 estate, much of this land now supports
 commercial forestry under the         
 management of the forestry commission.
 On the fertile red rocks of the lower 
 land,cereal crops are grown, and large
 areas are pasture for sheep,and beef  
 and dairy cattle.The area includes    
 several valleys,and on the sheltered  
 slopes facing the sun are several     
 large greenhouses producing           
 horticultural crops for London,and    
 local markets.                        </content>
