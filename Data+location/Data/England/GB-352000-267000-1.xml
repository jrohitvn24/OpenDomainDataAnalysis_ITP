		<content> The area is situated 6 miles to the   
 north of Leominster and 4 miles south 
 of Ludlow on the A49(T) and extends   
 eastwards towards Tenbury Wells along 
 the A456. The north western square and
 small ports of surrounding squares    
 are in the county of Shropshire, the  
 remaining squares are in Hereford and 
 Worcester. The River Teme, which flows
 in a south easterly direction         
 dominates the area. It provides       
 valuable farmland on the valley floor 
 and on its slopes are located the two 
 mainsettlements of the area -         
 Brimfield and Little Hereford. The    
 lowest point in the area is 61m, and  
 the heighest point is approximately   
 110m. Agriculture is the dominant     
 feature of the area also being the    
 largest employed. A by-pass of        
 Brimfield has recently been opened    
 which has taken the passing trade away</content>
