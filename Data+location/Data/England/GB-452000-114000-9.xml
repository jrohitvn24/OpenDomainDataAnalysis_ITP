		<title>09WOODMAN'S FARM-LAND USE</title>
		<content>{WOODMAN'S FARM, CURDRIDGE (G.R. SU    
{550153) Owner: Mr. D. Hill.           
  The farm measures 40 acres and       
 includes a number of different        
 land-uses.This year, sweetcorn covers 
 30 acres, potatoes another 5 and      
 finally the actual buildings occupy   
 the other 5. Many hedgerows have been 
 removed to increase productivity      
 Within the farm there are a number of 
 wet patches which limit its use, but  
 other areas are ideal for market      
 gardening. A crop rotation patern is  
 used on the farm, but the interviewers
 were left with the impression that the
 rotation was considerably flexible to 
 allow the farmer to insert crops he   
 felt would but most profitable that   
 year. However despite the existance of
 the arable farming, the dominent      
 activity on this farm was pig farming 
 plus a few sheep.                     </content>
