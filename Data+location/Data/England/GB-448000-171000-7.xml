		<title>07THE VILLAGE OF CURRIDGE</title>
		<content> Curridge is a small village. There are
 less than 200 houses. We sometimes    
 wish that it was bigger so that we    
 could have more of our friends close  
 by. The village is too small for      
 social amenities like a cinema or a   
 swimming pool and we have to go by car
 to a town for these. We would like to 
 have a park or an adventure playground
 where we can meet or play. The village
 is always clean and tidy and looks    
 beautiful. Several of the houses are  
 old (300 years is the oldest) and some
 of the trees are old. It is quiet and 
 peaceful and sometimes you can see    
 wild animals - deer, rabbits, foxes   
 and sometimes squirrels dash across   
 the road between the trees. We can    
 ride our bikes on the roads which are 
 not very busy, and on the footpaths   
 through the woods.
