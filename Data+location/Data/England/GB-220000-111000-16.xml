		<content> A  Cornish cross  can be  found in the
 grounds of{Tonacombe Manor}and another
 inscribed at the front entrance to the
{Bush Inn.}At{Shop}is a bellbuoy hauled
 outside a cottage  whilst next door is
 a verse engraved  in the  glass of the
 porch by Harry Hambly in 1907.        
 The parish contains 4 graveyards, 3 of
 them non - conformist.   There were 10
 churches or  chapels,  8 of which were
 non - conformist but only two of them,
 and the parish church remain in use.  
 Of 8  mills in the area,  none are now
 working  but their  remains are  still
 apparent in various stages of decay.  
 Along the  coastline  many  ships have
 foundered  where their  remains are to
 be discovered.                        
 The parish  probably still  has{otters
 in its secluded  waterways and was the
 last refuge  of the now  extinct{Large
{Blue}butterfly.                       </content>
