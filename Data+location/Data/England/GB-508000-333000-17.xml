		<title>17A BUSY HAPPY WIFE'S DAY</title>
		<content>  My name is Yvonne Blake.Living in    
 Billingborough is very peaceful after 
 living in London for 32 years. Today  
 is Monday and this is the day I go    
 swimming with the local Primary School
 which my daughters attend. I go into  
 the water to help the non-swimmers.   
 When I get home, I have to feed the   
 animals. After I have had my lunch, I 
 take Blazer our dog for a walk. When  
 I've taken Blazer out I have to clean 
 up and fetch my children from school. 
  I prepare dinner and my husband comes
 home from the workshop where he makes 
 pine furniture. After dinner the      
 children go out to play with their    
 friends and I have a chat with my     
 husband about our day. At 7 o'clock my
 youngest child goes to bed and then at
 8 o'clock my eldest child goes to bed 
 and my husband and I spend the evening
 together.                             </content>
