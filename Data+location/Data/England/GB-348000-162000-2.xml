		<title>02Redhill village</title>
		<content> Redhill village is near the top of Red
 Hill,the centre lying just off the A38
 on the road to Wrington.The name      
 probably comes from the colour of the 
 soil,which is clay.                   
   The village hall(with playing field)
 and church are in the centre of the   
 village,but there are no shops here   
 and the primary school closed in 1984.
 However there is green-grocers' van,a 
 mobile library calling fortnightly and
 a pub(The Darlington Arms) on the A38.
   Wrington,a larger village,is under 2
 miles away and used by Redhill people 
 for local shopping,doctors and        
 dentists.The local Brownies,Guides,   
 Cubs and Scouts also meet there.      
   The Wrington and Redhill journal is 
 a locally produced monthly magazine   
 taken by many households.             
   The bus service through Redhill goes
 from Bristol to Weston-super-mare.    </content>
