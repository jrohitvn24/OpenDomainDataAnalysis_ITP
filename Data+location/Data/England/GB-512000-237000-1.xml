		<title>01THE TOWN OF SHEFFORD</title>
		<content>     Situated in the flat lands of Mid-
 Bedfordshire,Shefford is a small      
 market town of some Three and a Half  
 THousand population.It was first      
 granted a market charter in 1225 and  
 although never achieving any notable  
 status has continued to servethe      
 surrounding agricultural comunity     
 throughout the centuries.Although the 
 Town as such did not exist at the time
 of the Domesday Book it is known that 
 there were two Roman settlements      
 within the present bondaries,possibly 
 established during the 3rd and 4th    
 centuries.                            
       The name is derived from the    
 Anglo saxon Schipford or Sepford      
 "Sheep Ford" which indicates that here
 was an easy crossing point through the
 two small rivers Hit(or Cambel) and   
 Flitt.
