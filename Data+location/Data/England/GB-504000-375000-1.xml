		<content> Our chosen area is mainly agricultural
 with no forestry,although there are   
 patches of forest in the surrounding  
 districts.The arable land mainly      
 produces wheat,barley,oil-seed-rape,  
 sugar-beet and potatoes.Farmers are   
 reducing their cattle-raising because 
 of poor economic returns.Grazing land 
 is increasingly used by sheep or is   
 ploughed for planting with arable     
 crops.                                
     The{Newark}to{Grimsby}railway link
  passes through but no longer serves  
 the village.Communication by the      
 main {A158}road brings much traffic   
 past the school making it difficult to
 cross the road in the summer-time.Many
 vehicles are going to and from the    
 coastal resorts.                      
 To serve the main road traffic there  
 are three filling stations and two    
 hotels.                               </content>
