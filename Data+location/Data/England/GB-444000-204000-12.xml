		<content> Hill End Field Study Centre is        
 situated off the Eynsham Road between 
 Dean Court and Farmoor.               
 The site is owned by the University of
 Oxford and run by the Oxfordshire     
 County Council. Children from schools 
 within a six-mile radius use it for   
 field study. 179 children are in      
 residence in groups from March 1st to 
 October 30th each year; there are also
 two non-resident groups a day         
 throughout the school year, a total of
 approx. 300 children.                 
 Hill End is one of the oldest centres 
 of its kind in the country.           
 During the summer months other        
 organisations also come to Hill End   
 sometimes camping in the grounds.
