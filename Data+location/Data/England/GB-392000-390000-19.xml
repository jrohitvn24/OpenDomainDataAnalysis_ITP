		<title>19Werneth Low</title>
		<content> Although Bredbury, Romiley and Woodley
 are suburbs of Stockport there are    
 farms within the area. However these  
 farms are not 'typical' working farms.
 Hillside Farm and Hare &amp; Hounds farm  
 on Werneth Low have both responded to 
 the local demand for stabling and     
 grazing horses. Indeed the owner of   
 the Hare &amp; Hounds farm has recently   
 purchased the farm and got rid of the 
 last vestages of 'normal' farming in  
 order to make room for more horses and
 ponies. The farm buildings and        
 residential areas date from the mid   
 nineteenth century although the  area 
 was farmed before that.               
                                       
 Also Werneth Low attracts ramblers and
 walkers because of its close proximity
 to suburbia and its natural beauty. It
 could be described as Bredbury's      
 'lung'.                               </content>
