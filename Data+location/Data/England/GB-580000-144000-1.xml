		<content> The village of{Headcorn}is based on a 
 street of shops,the High Street,which 
 runs E - W and is over-looked by the  
{Parish Church}at the West end. There  
 is a wide variety of shops selling    
 such items as clothes,bicycles and    
 medicines,Chinese take-away food,wines
 and newspapers. Apart from the Parish 
 Church there are Catholic,Methodist   
 and Baptist churches which thrive.    
 There are two sub-branch banks,a post 
 office and agencies for Building      
 Societies. All of this goes to make up
 a very busy{shopping centre}which     
 attracts people from much of the      
 surrounding countryside. In fact on   
 Saturdays the High Street is packed   
 with shoppers and also cars. There are
 several open spaces for children to   
 play upon and two sports fields for   
 cricket and football. There is also a 
{Primary School}of course!             </content>
