		<content> The Marazion "Apollo" Male Choir is   
 one of the best known of many Cornish 
 choirs. It was formed over 80 years   
 ago and has about sixty members       
 including an accompanist and          
 conductor.                            
                                       
 The choir gives concerts locally      
 and enters many musical festival      
 competitions throughout the British   
 Isles. It has also travelled abroad   
 and given performances in other       
 countries.                            
                                       
 It has had many successes over the    
 years and become known nationally     
 through recordings of its work,       
 and its performances on radio and     
 television.
