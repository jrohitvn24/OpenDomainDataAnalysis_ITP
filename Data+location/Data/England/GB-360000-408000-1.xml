		<title>01WELCOME TO BLACKROD</title>
		<content>   {Blackrod}is a quiet little village.
 It is surrounded by beautiful views of
 hills and fields. Many new people have
 come to live in Blackrod,as new houses
 are built,because of the rural setting
 and its closeness to the motorway and 
 the relative cheapness of the         
 property.                             
   Blackrod is an old village with an  
 Anglo-Saxon name. It means a black or 
 bleak clearing in a forest. There are 
 still several attractive old buildings
 here.{Bobbin Hall}got its name because
 a master spinner lived there and at   
 the side is a row of terraced cottages
 he owned. There was a passage from the
 hall through the cottages so the      
 master could walk through to collect  
 the bobbins of cotton his workers     
 spun.{Pool Green}is a row of cottages 
 behind what remains of the old village
 green.                                </content>
