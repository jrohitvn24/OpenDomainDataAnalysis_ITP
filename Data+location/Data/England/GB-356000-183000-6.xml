		<content> The houses at Knole Park Almondsbury  
 were planned to take advantage of its 
 elevated position, with detached      
 houses in large gardens. The houses   
 contain much of the stone from the    
 original mansion so have a distinctive
 appearance. Many of the Pilning farm  
 houses are well over 100 years old and
 built of grey stone with tiled roofs. 
 One farm house is thought to be 700   
 years old and reputed to have been    
 connected with smuggling from the     
 Severn.Pilning has a ribbon           
 development of old cottages now       
 renovated on a road out of the village
 The area is well placed for television
 reception; the Welsh programmes as    
 well as the English are received. Some
 daily newspapers are delivered. A     
 parish magazine either Pilning or     
 Olveston is delivered free. A mobile  
 County library visits fortnightly.    </content>
