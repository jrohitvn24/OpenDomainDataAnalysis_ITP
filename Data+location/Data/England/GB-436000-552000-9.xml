		<content>  Soon after 1967 the{colliery}closed  
 and{New Silksworth}lost one of it's   
 larger employers. The spoil heap which
 the colliery created has now being    
 converted into a ski slope and        
 recreation centre.                    
  The important streets in{New         
{Silksworth}are{Blind lane}and         
{Silksworth Terrace}where shops and    
 amenites are located.                 
{ Blind Lane}takes its name from the   
 time when horses used to pull carts up
 and down the lane. The horses were    
 reluctant to pull the heavy loads up  
 the incline and were blindfolded so   
 that they didnt know in which         
 direction they were travelling.       
  In the days when the coal mine was in
 use{New Silksworth}was a closely knit 
 mining community but now there are no 
 industries which employ the large     
 numbers of people.                    </content>
