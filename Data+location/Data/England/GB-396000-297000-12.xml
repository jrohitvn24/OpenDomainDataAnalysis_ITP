		<title>12A Police Officer</title>
		<content>  We interviewed two police officers   
 who are resident beat officers in     
 Darlaston. They've been working in    
 Darlaston for 2 years. They do things 
 like going to court, telling people if
 their children have been in accidents,
 handling football riots etc. They go  
 in car chases. They think judges are  
 lenient. They said that crime is      
 mostly commited by children under 17. 
 The crimes that are most common are   
 mugging,vandalism and burglary. They  
 think criminals don't care when they  
 have commited a crime. The police     
 officers said that the worst thing    
 about their job is being on shifts.   
 The worst thing they've had to deal   
 with is an armed robbery where two men
 escaped in a taxi after they had      
 commited a crime. They have never     
 faced a gun although constable Foster 
 was trained to use one.               </content>
