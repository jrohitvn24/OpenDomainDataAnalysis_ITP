		<title>14THE VILLAGE FETE</title>
		<content> Most fetes claim to have "something   
 for everyone" but on June 15th 1985,  
 St. Mary's really meant it.Stalls and 
 sideshows,manned by mercenaries whose 
 magnetic fingers attracted money,     
 occupied the rectory lawn.The Fordham 
 Hall provided rest for the weary &amp;    
 help for the hungry; sit down teas    
 available all afternoon on a self-    
 service basis were greatly appreciated
 Meanwhile, in church, an ancient      
 village map was displayed &amp; two       
 members of the Village Research Group 
 helped a steady stream of visitors    
 interested in tracing their ancestry  
 or seeking information about their    
 house names.Then a group of Village   
 School children showed how quickly    
 they were adapting to using a computer
 by demonstrating some of the work they
 had done on the Domesday project.The  
 sun shone! All this &amp; profit-Â£900-too!</content>
