		<title>06Chatteris - Horseway Lock</title>
		<content> Horseway Lock is situated on          
 Vermuden's Drain between Horseway     
 Bridge and the River Ouse.  It was    
 constructed between 1844 and 1848 as  
 part of the drainage and waterways    
 system.  It was hoped that its use    
 would help to clear the waterways of  
 the constant problem of silt build up 
 and weed growth.  Gradually the drain 
 and lock fell into dis-use and the    
 drain had no traffic.  No boats go up 
 and down this stretch of the Ouse any 
 more. The drain has become very over  
 grown especially on the North side of 
 the lock, which is completely         
 impassable.  This stretch is          
 administered by the Great Ouse Water  
 Authority and they have not cleared   
 the drain.  Although the lock has been
 renewed  between the rivers Nene      
 and Ouse.
