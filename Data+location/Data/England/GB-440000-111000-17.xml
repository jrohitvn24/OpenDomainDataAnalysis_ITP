		<title>17    Oxford St. Area</title>
		<content> The people in our area are quite      
 friendly. There are a few shops. Most 
 of the people work in these shops.    
 Those who live in this area think that
 it is a very safe place to walk at    
 night.                                
 The street has many fine examples of  
 Georgian and Regency houses and       
 buildings.In the last few years the   
 residents and business owners have got
 together to run a street_market.One   
 of the oldest shops in the street has 
 been supplying uniforms to officers in
 the Army ,Navy and Air_force for about
 200 years now.
