		<title>07N. Lopham Annual Fete</title>
		<content>      At the village fete in June, held
 at the Lophams' Village Hall, there   
 was 5_a_side football and some clay   
 pigeon shooting.  We had races, e.g.  
 mini marathon, tug of war, egg and    
 spoon, flat race, football slalom.    
 There was money for first, second and 
 third _ 15p for first, 10p for second 
 and 5p for third.  In the hall were   
 cake stalls and tea stalls.  There    
 were lots of games stalls, such as    
 skittles, a netball game and a bean   
 bag game. The bottle stall was good.  
 Each bottle had a number and you      
 bought a ticket that matched the      
 number on the bottle and you won a    
 bottle of something.  It was 20p a    
 ticket.                               
   The highlight of the day was when   
 David Bellamy came. He pulled out some
 raffle tickets and he gave some people
 his autograph.                        </content>
