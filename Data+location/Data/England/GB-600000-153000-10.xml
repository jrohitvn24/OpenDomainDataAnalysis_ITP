		<title>10Badlesmere : Arable Farming</title>
		<content> Arable farming predominates and is    
 managed intensively with a            
 preponderance of autumn sown crops.   
 Of the cultivated land, 4O% is winter 
 wheat, 2O% oilseed rape, 2O% barley,  
 lO% grass lays and lO% other crops.   
 Farmers aim for a lO tonne per hectare
 ceral crop, harvesting the corn with  
 large combines then drying it in      
 electronically controlled grain driers
 to l5% moisture for storage.  Surplus 
 grain is a problem as is surplus      
 straw.  Much is baled into half tonne 
 round bales for bedding and fodder;   
 the rest is ploughed in or burnt.     
 Speed of harvesting is paramount to   
 facilitate drilling the next crop by  
 mid-October.  Several implements are  
 used in tandem behind a single tractor
 producing a seedbed and drilling the  
 crop in a single operation.
