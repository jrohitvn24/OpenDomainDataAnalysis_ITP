		<content> Westbury may be described as a small  
 market town in an essentially         
 agricultural area.The market, however,
 became extinct and the town developed 
 light industry both inside and outside
 the town.                             
 On the eastern side are several firms 
 which deal with such products as      
 surgical beds and invalid carriages,  
 industrial staples and optical        
 instruments.On the western side are   
 companies specialising in plastics,   
 potato packaging,tyre dealers and     
 television broadcasting equipment.    
 On the north side there are civil     
 engineers,national dairy pruducts     
 and manufacturers of fire detection   
 and time systems.                     
 On the Trowbridge Road side there are 
 specialised engraving and machine     
 tools manufacturers,civil engineering 
 and the works of Blue Circle Cement.  </content>
