		<content> 4){Stick in the mud}is a game in      
 which you have about six people. One  
 is on and the rest run off. The one   
 which is on runs after them and tries 
 to stag them. If you are stagged you  
 have to stand with your legs apart,   
 until someone goes under your legs.   
 5) In{on the mountain}two people      
 turn the rope and the other person    
 jumps in and starts skipping. While   
 the person is skiping a rhyme is sung.
 (This is part of the rhyme).          
  {On the mountain}stands a lady       
   Who she is we do not know           
   All she wants is gold and silver    
   Gold and silver and a nice young man
   Who shall we call him?              
  (a boys name is sung then on with the
  game.)
