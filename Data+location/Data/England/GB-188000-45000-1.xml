		<content>{General Survey of Probus Area}        
 This area has one main settlement,    
 which is the village of Probus between
 Truro &amp; St.Austell.Most of the        
 remainder is mixed farmland with      
 scattered farmhouses.The countryside  
 has undulating hills &amp; valleys,often  
 with woodland in the latter.There is  
 one large estate,Trewithen,with a     
 house &amp; gardens open to public.Also   
 open to the public are the            
 Demonstration Gardens,probably unique 
 in Europe.There 2 main roads,the A3078
 to St.Mawes &amp; the A390,one of the main
 trunk roads through Cornwall.These are
 connected by a maze of narrow lanes,  
 usually with high hedges,thick with   
 wild flowers in June.Apart from the   
 traffic on the main roads,much of the 
 area seems remote &amp; untouched by the  
 tourist trade.
