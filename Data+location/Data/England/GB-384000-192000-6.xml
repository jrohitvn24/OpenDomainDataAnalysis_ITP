		<title>06St.Mary's Church Beverstone.</title>
		<content> Beverstone Church stands just to the  
 north of the castle and is reached    
 from a narrow track which leads off   
 the A.4135.It is most attractively    
 surrounded by open fields and farm    
 buildings.The church is Norman in     
 origin,but it was extended in 1361    
 when Thomas,Lord Berkeley refortified 
 the castle.The church had fallen into 
 disrepair by the nineteenth century so
 it was restored in 1842 and again in  
 1884.Of particular interest inside the
 building are the Berkeley Chapel and  
 the ancient Rood Screen which spans   
 the chancel arch.Outside the          
 church,two notable features are the   
 stone coffin covers built into the    
 walls and the relief sculpture on the 
 south face of the tower.
