		<content>    N.E.L.P. stands for North-east     
 London Polytechnic. We visited the    
 Barking precinct; there are two other 
 precincts, one in West Ham and the    
 other in Stratford. The Barking site  
 was built in 1930 as South-east Essex 
 Technical College. In 1970 it was     
 renamed North-east London Polytechnic.
    There are about 5,000 students here
 and about 550 tutors. To get in you   
 have to get about 5 'O'levels and 2   
 'A'levels.                            
    There are lots of facilities like a
 swimming pool, a gym, lots of         
 computers, squash courts and seven    
 libraries. The librarian said there   
 are about 300,000 books   there.
