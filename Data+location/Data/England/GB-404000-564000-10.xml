		<title>10TOURISM (HUNDAY MUSEUM)</title>
		<content>{HUNDAY MUSEUM }IS SET IN BEAUTIFUL    
 WOODED GROUNDS,WITH A SMALL LAKE ABOUT
 A MILE FROM THE MAIN COMPLEX.TWO YEARS
 AGO A NARROW GAUGE RAILWAY OPENED TO  
 TAKE VISITORS AROUND THE LAKE.THE     
 ENGINE WAS BOUGHT FROM A COALMINE SO  
 IT IS COMPLETELY SPARKPROOF.THE ROUND 
 TRIP TAKES ABOUT 30 MINUTES BUT       
 PROBLEMS CAN ARISE DUE TO THE TRACK   
 BEING ON AN INCLINE.IN WET WEATHER THE
 RAILS BECOME SLIPPERY SO THE TRAIN    
 WHEELS CANNOT GRIP,WHICH IS MOST      
 LIKELY TO HAPPEN IF THERE IS A FULL   
 LOAD OF PASSENGERS.ON MY FIRST TRIP   
 THE DRIVER ATTEMPTED THE INCLINE 4 OR 
 5 TIMES BEFORE ADMITTING DEFEAT AND   
 AND ASKING EVERYONE TO WALK BACK TO   
 THE MUSEUM,FORTUNATELY NOT FAR.THERE  
 IS A CAFETERIA SERVING DELICOUS HOME  
 COOKED FOOD AND A PICNIC AREA FOR     
 THOSE WHO PREFER IT.THIS UTILISES OLD 
 MILLSTONES AS TABLES AND TRACTOR SEATS</content>
