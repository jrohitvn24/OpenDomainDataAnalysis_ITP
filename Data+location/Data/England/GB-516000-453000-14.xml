		<title>14COASTAL EROSION</title>
		<content> The sea crashes against the cliffs and
 digs away at the mud from the bottom. 
 Soon the top of the cliff drops off   
 and gets washed away.The soil that    
 gets washed away collects down the    
 coast at Spurn Point.Every year about 
 a metre of the land is lost to erosion
 Three villages,Hyde,Withow and Cleeton
 have been washed from this area.There 
 are different ways we could stop the  
 cliffs from eroding.A  concrete wall  
 could be built but this would cost    
 half a million pounds for every       
 hundred metres.We could tip rubbish at
 the cliffs but this would look very   
 messy.Mr Walker at Beach Bank built a 
 sea wall of wood and rubbish to stop  
 the sea eroding.At the present rate of
 erosion we estimate the land where the
 school is,will be washed away in a    
 about 850 years.   by Michelle Baker
