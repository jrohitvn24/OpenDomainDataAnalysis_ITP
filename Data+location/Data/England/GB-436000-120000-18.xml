		<title>18Mrs. Rickman - an interview</title>
		<content> Mrs. Rickman s a dinner lady at our   
 school(Cupernham Junior). We          
 interviewed her on Wednesday June 19th
 1985. Mrs. Rickman told us about 'old 
 Romsey'. She was a little girl during 
 the Second World War and she can      
 remember the old Romsey of that time. 
 She was living in the same place for  
 about 35 years. When she grew up she  
 helped her father run the Scout hut by
 Ganger Farm. It used to get smashed in
 and they always repaired it so the    
 Scouts could carry on. Near to Ganger 
 Farm there was a prisoner of war camp 
 in the fields. Sometimes they used to 
 visit the camp and speak to the       
 soldiers. The soldiers sometimes gave 
 Mrs. Rickman some apples or sweets.   
 Mrs. Rickman and Mr. Rickman used to  
 have a bomb shelter outside of their  
 house.
