		<title>04St. Nicholas, Swineshead</title>
		<content> There has been a church in Swineshead 
 since 12th century, the present one   
 was completed in 14th century. It     
 contains a fine tomb recess coffin    
 slab and font. The rood screne still  
 bears traces of the original painted  
 decoration. The nave windows are      
 original and the West door is a good  
 example of 14th century tracery work. 
 Some of the arms and miser cords in   
 the choir are very old, as are many of
 the benches in the knave.             
 Two interesting stone carvings can be 
 seen to the east of the chancel arch  
 and faint traces of wall paintings,   
 which are due to be restored.         
 The clock in the church dates back to 
 1600's although modifications were    
 made at a later date. The clock has   
 not been operational for 30/40 years, 
 although there are plans for a        
 possible restoration.                 </content>
