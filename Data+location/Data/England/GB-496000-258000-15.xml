		<title>15Sharnbrook's Soil &amp; Trees</title>
		<content> The soils in this area vary from free 
 draining{alluvial soils}alongside the 
 Ouse and the Sharn Brook, to{heavy    
{clay}overlying Oxford and Boulder clay
 on the higher ground. {River gravels  
 are under the soil in the valley      
 bottoms, which are well drained, but  
 with water readily available near the 
 surface. Although{most of the area's  
{trees have been planted,}a natural    
 pattern is reflected in the species   
 chosen, with{alder, willow and poplar 
 alongside the river and brook.        
 Heavier soils have been planted with  
{ash and some oak. Field maple}occurs  
 as an understorey with{hazel and thorn
 as a shrub layer in the woods on the  
 clay soils. Scattered areas of        
 conifers, mainly{pine and spruce,}pure
 and in mixtures with broadleaves are  
 not very successful on heavy soil in  
 this low rainfall area.               </content>
