		<title>14TRANSPORT IN PENDLESIDE</title>
		<content> As{most people travel out of the area 
{to work, school and shop,}transport   
 plays an important part. Two school   
 buses are provided each day and as    
 there is little industry in the area, 
 the majority of people need to travel 
 to work. Different forms of transport 
 are used such as cars, motor cycles   
 and bicycles, with a small number     
 walking.{The only form of public      
{transport is the bus.}In former years 
 the bus service was more extensive,   
 but with most households owning at    
 least one car, it is only the older   
 inhabitants who rely on public        
 transport nowadays. Consequently, the 
 service has been reduced drastically, 
 until{now buses only run on alternate 
{days.}The summer brings a lot of      
 visitors to the area, most travel by  
 car, but buses do operate extensively 
 at weekends and holiday times.        </content>
