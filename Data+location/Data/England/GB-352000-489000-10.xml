		<title>10LOWTHER AND DAWSON.</title>
		<content>  This company builds chiefly in the   
 Kendal area but also does work further
 afield if need be. It was started by  
{Ken Lowther}in 1955.                  
{ Energy conservation}is important and 
 it costs Â£1100 to insulate a house.   
{House designs}have become more varied 
 over the years while the materials    
 used have altered because of changing 
 safety regulations. The size of a     
 house depends on what people want and 
 can afford; the company tries to give 
 people the design they ask for, but   
 this depends on{planning permission.  
{ Lowther and Dawson}are responsible   
 for 550 houses in this area.{Kendal   
{Creameries}which took a year to build 
 was their largest project. At{Kendal  
{Parks}they have built 400 homes to be 
 followed by a further 78. They have   
 also completed a shop and will soon be
 building several play areas.          </content>
