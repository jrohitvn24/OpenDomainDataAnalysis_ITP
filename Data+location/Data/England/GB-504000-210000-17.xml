		<content> The{houses}on Woodhall Farm are very  
{close together and have very small    
{gardens}whereas around it the         
{country-side is very open and gently  
{undulating with scattered woodland.}It
 is at much the same height apart from 
 the south-west corner where the River 
 Gade flows in a{deep valley}towards   
 Hemel Hempstead.                      
 Many of the fields have a depression  
 in the middle.  This is sometimes     
 quite shallow and ploughed over but is
 often so deep it is left as a         
{tree-filled dell.} The dell to the    
 East of Eastbrook Hay Farm is the     
 deepest and has chalk cliffs showing  
 the layer of{chalk rock}that underlies
 the{clay soil.}The farmer here still  
 occasionally mines out the chalk to   
 spread on the fields as they did about
 100 years ago but usually the dell is 
 only used to dump and burn rubbish.   </content>
