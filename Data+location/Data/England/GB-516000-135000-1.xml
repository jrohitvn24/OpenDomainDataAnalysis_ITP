		<content> This block of rich, green countryside 
 contains ten farms.  Most of the      
 Fields are used for grazing sheep and 
 cows, though many fields did not have 
 animals on at the time of the survey. 
 Much of the remaining land has a      
 fairly dense coverage of deciduous    
 trees.  The area has many small hills 
 and dales, offering several views of a
 few square kilometres.  A part from   
 scatttered farm buildings and the two 
 pubs there are few houses.  A nunnery 
 was hidden away in an extensive       
 enclosed area of well kept gardens.   
 Two main single crriage-way roads go  
 through this block. (24, A29) all     
 other routes are country lanes        
 bordered by trees or tall, thick      
 hedges with no pavement.  Some are    
 simple tracks of stones and gravel or 
 entrances on private property.
