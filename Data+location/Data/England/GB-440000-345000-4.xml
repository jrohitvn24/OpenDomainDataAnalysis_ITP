		<content> A typical Saturday for me is to rise  
 at 8:45 a.m. Breakfast is cereals, a  
 mug of tea and toast, followed by     
 reading the sports and T.V. news in   
 the Sun newspaper. The remaining part 
 of the morning is spent with my       
 brother at a football coaching scheme 
 at a local Sports' Centre whilst my   
 dad goes to work at a builders'       
 merchants in Kirkby in Ashfield. We   
 all arrive home at 1 p.m. for lunch   
 of chips and beans. The afternoon is  
 spent watching T.V. or reading to my  
 sister whilst dad goes to race  his   
 pigeons. In the evening after a bath  
 the whole family visit the Sunnyside  
 Working  Men's Club where my mum and  
 dad play Bingo whilst Paul and myself 
 play Pool or try to win money on the  
 fruit machine until 11 p.m. when we   
 return home. I am elevan years old.
