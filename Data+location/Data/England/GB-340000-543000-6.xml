		<title>06HIGHEAD CASTLE</title>
		<content> Situated in the area of Inglewood     
 Forest. The Norman Kings' love of     
 hunting brought about laws designed to
 protect forests and to conserve deer. 
 Highead Castle was built to protect   
 the King's interests in the 13th      
 century and was the home of The Keeper
 of the Castle and Forest.             
 Since the 13th century there have been
 periods of decline and expansion but  
 since a serious fire in the 1940's    
 there has been continued decline      
 leading to a possible demolition of   
 what was once in this area the pre-   
 eminent Georgian mansion.
