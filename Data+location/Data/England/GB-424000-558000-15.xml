		<title>15LOCAL PRESS COVERAGE</title>
		<content> For a week we studied the copies of a 
 local area newspaper - The Journal. We
 found 10 stories of crime, one of     
 which was in Gateshead, a robbery. 12 
 stories of human interest including   
 one which was directly related to our 
 area as it was about a policewoman who
 lived at{Eighton Banks}and who was    
 shot wilst on duty in Gateshead over a
 year ago. There were 9 sport stories, 
 one about the Great North Run which   
 passes through Gateshead. Each day the
 paper contains the days television    
 programmes and reviews and cartoons,  
 horroscopes, classified adverts and an
 international news page.One page each 
 day changed, one day it was motoring  
 news, another business news, another  
 day a womans page, followed by farming
 news and then books. The weather      
 forcast appeared every day. The most  
 important item was on the front page. </content>
