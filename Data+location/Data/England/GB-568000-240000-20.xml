		<content>{J.G. Unwin}started{Unwin Grain}in     
 1885. They get grain from the farmer  
 and give it straight to the millers.  
 The millers roll and crush and grind  
 the wheat to make flour for our       
 biscuits and breakfast food and bread.
 They do lots of different tests to the
 grain to make sure it is good enough. 
 The most important test is the        
 moisture test to make sure it is dry. 
 If it is not it goes mouldy. They get 
 2,000,000 tonnes of grain a year. They
 export 5,000,000 tonnes. There are    
 only 12 people employed.{Westrope's   
{Haulage}has been in business for 50   
 years. There are 36 people employed in
 Birdbrook and 19 people employed in   
 Scotland. They do more exporting than 
 importing. They take chemicals to     
 Taiwan. They take jacks from Braintree
 to Scotland. They move paints,        
 petfood, flowers, plants, cereals.    </content>
