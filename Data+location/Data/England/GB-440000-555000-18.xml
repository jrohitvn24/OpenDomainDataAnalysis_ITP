		<title>18Mr.Bell-Memories of an OAP 2</title>
		<content>{CONT from page 17                     
  Mr.Bell remembers the soup kitchens  
 where poor people were sure of        
 something to eat.                     
 The Silver Jubilee was celebrated in  
 his street with a party.There was lots
 of food.The children were dressed in  
 red,white and blue clothes specially  
 made for the occasion by their        
 mothers.After tea the children took   
 part in organised games.              
 A lot of things have changed since    
 1935.Some things are better but       
 Mr.Bell hinks that today there is a   
 lack of community spirit- n o longer  
 can you go out and leave your door    
 unlocked without worrying about       
 someone unwelcome going in.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
