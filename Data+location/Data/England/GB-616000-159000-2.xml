Bran Flakes for my breakfast at

beach at 9.15am.  The beach is in      
Herne Bay.All my family were going but 
not all intending to swim in the sea.I 
had salad for my dinner with some cakes
for dessert which my gran had made at  
home before we came. We got home at    
7.15pm and had tea of mince and rice   
and a drink of Lemonade. After tea I   
had a bath and washed my hair.By this  
time it was 8.30pm.  Then I dried my   
hair and watched a television programme
and then went to bed with a hot drink.
