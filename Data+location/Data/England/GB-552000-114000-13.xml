		<content> Patients may choose which doctor they 
 register with but choice is limited by
 mobility. Dr.Elliot is the only doctor
 in East Hoathly and, in the absence of
 a Chemist's, he dispences medicines.  
 He is not in partnership but has a    
 relief system with two doctors from   
 outside the area.                     
 Under reorganisation in 1974, all     
 District Nurses are attached to a     
 doctor and specialise in midwifery,   
 health visiting or as a distict nurse.
 Sister Seaman is the local health     
 visitor. The hospital used by most    
 people in the area is in Eastbourne,  
 thirteen miles away.                  
 Surgery hours in East Hoathly are:    
 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday 
 0900-0930 and 1745-1845.
