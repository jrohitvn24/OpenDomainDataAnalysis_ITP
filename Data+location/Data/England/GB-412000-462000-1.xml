		<title>01The Hills around Beverley</title>
		<content> The area is very hilly and is mainly  
 rough grazing and moorland.           
 Coldstones quarry is near the top of  
 the hill and employs about            
 twelve people.  About a thousand tons 
 of limestone are esxtracted a day from
 the quarry.  This is used for road    
 chipping and chemical processes.  Many
 houses which have been direlict have  
 been bought by commuters in recent    
 years and are now being restored and  
 moved into.  None of the land is      
 cultivated but is just used for       
 grazing cattle and sheep.  The moors  
 are used for breeding grouse as the   
 soil is too poor to support much      
 vegetation and is therefore unsuitable
 for sheep.  The village of Beverely is
 scattered along the green and has an  
 ancient chapel.  In square No. 8 there
 is Yorke's Falley which was build to  
 create employment.                    </content>
