		<title>11MASSEY'S FOLLY</title>
		<content> In the later part of the 19th. century
 William Massey became rector of       
 Farringdon. He designed an elaborate  
 building and then personally employed 
 two men for over 20 years to construct
 it.In 1903 the Revd. Massey ran out   
 of money, the inside of the towers    
 still incomplete. A few years later   
 the building was used as a private    
 boarding school for girls. During W.W.
 2 hay was stored in the folly! Today  
 it is the village hall,run by         
 volunteers, and one part is the       
 village primary school. Many people   
 consider the building to be completely
 out of keeping with the rest of the   
 buildings.
