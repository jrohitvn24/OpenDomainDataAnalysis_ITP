		<title>10LAURA WEBB'S DAY</title>
		<content>I wake at 7.30a.m. and get up after    
5 minutes. I go into the bathroom and  
wash and dress.I go downstairs and pick
up the letters and make my breakfast.I 
eat while I watch T.V.I prepare my     
lunch,brush my teeth and leave for     
school.We have Assembly first and then 
we usually have Maths.We have a break  
with milk and biscuits at 10.35 and    
finish the morning with English work.  
We have our lunch at 12 and I usually  
have a Breakaway bar, two pieces of    
brown bread and butter and a carton of 
yoghurt.Work starts again at 1.15p.m.  
and we have lessons such as Art until  
2.30 when we have a break of 10        
minutes.After this we finish off       
various pieces of work until we finish 
at 3.45.I go home and play games on my 
Spectrum computer.I heat a Beefburger  
in our microwave oven and go to bed at 
9.45.                                  </content>
