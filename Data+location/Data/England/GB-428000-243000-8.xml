		<content> The area surrounding the three        
 villages is mainly covered with farm  
 land enclosed by cut hedges of        
 hawthorn,elm,field maple and ash with 
 mature trees of ash,oak,crab apple and
 wild pear.Elm trees are starting to   
 grow again since all mature trees were
 destroyed in 1976 by{Dutch Elm        
{Disease.}Groups and farmers are       
 planting oak,ash,lime,willow,maple,   
 birch and hornbeam.Hedge saplings     
 including elm are being left uncut by 
 some farmers.                         
                                       
 There are areas of deciduous woodland 
 on Idlicote Hill chiefly "Hell Brake" 
 of 18 acres.These provide cover for   
 herds of up to 100 fallow deer,       
 including some of almost white        
 colouring.Other wildlife are muntjac  
 deer,badgers,foxes,weasels,stoats,    
 grey squirrels and grass snakes.      </content>
