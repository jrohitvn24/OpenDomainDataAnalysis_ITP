		<content> The dominant tree is the Oak, with    
 other hardwoods (no longer Elm),      
 Willow, Alder, Holly and Field        
 Maple.Mistletoe is common in orchards.
 Many wild flowers are found on banks  
 and hedgerows, including wild         
 snowdrops. The Hereford and Radnor    
 Naturalists' Trust is active in the   
 area, recording and protecting wild   
 species of flowers and animals.       
 Badgers, foxes and hedgehogs are well 
 established but otters are now very   
 uncommon.                             
 Footpaths and bridleways marked on the
 Ordnance Survey maps are often        
 difficult to follow on the ground     
 because too few people use them to    
 keep them open.
