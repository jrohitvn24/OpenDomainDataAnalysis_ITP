		<content>   Stella  suggested that  we went to a
 lace  class at  the{ Secondary School.
 Which was  taken by a lady  called Mrs
 Handey. The second piece of work I did
 was a  penguin. I did  this  piece  in
 black and white.                      
   The  next  piece I  did was slightly
 harder, it was an owl.                
   I went to my first lace day in March
 at{Wolverton.                         
   At the end of term  Stella suggested
 that I went to her on a  Monday night.
 After a while another girl  started. A
 few  months  later  two ladies, one of
 them  already  having  had experience,
 decided to come.                      
   We  were asked to{ demonstrate  lace
 for  Maids  Moreton  Church  fete  and
 through  that someone else started. At
 the moment I am making a flower out of
 lace.
