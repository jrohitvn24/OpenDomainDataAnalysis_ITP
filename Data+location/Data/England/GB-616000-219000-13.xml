		<title>13OUR VET</title>
		<content> We have a vet in Little Clacton who   
 works at Kinfaun Kennels. There is a  
 large practice which treats  animals  
 from a wide area. Altogether there are
 five veterinary surgeons who take it  
 in turns to look after the animals.   
 Between 200-300 a week are treated    
 &amp; if they are very ill they can stay  
 in hospital until they get well. The  
 vets also help birds if they are sick.
 Most of the animals are people's pets 
 but they also help a small number of  
 farm animals.                         
 Like a doctor, the vet sometimes goes 
 to see a sick animal at the owner's   
 home if they do not have transport or 
 if the creature is too ill to move, or
 if he's been run over by a car.  The  
 boarding kennels behind the hospital  
 can hold 100 dogs &amp; 20 cats usually   
 when people have to go on holiday.
