		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content>      The 3x4km area is predominantly  
 rural but does include one village in 
 the south-eastern area called{Bishop's
{Tachbrook.}In the north-eastern area  
 is to be found part of the            
{A.P.Leamington}works and the still    
 growing{Heathcote Industrial Estate. }
      Much of the farmland which is    
 gently undulating in character is     
 owned by a few landowners.            
      Within this area is a Sewage     
 Works,a hospital for the elderly and  
 in the north-western corner the       
 grounds of {Warwick Castle}through    
 which runs the {River Avon.}          
      Although the major land-use is   
 crop-growing there are significant    
 areas of grassland, grazing and       
 increasingly,gravel pits.             
      The busy{A41}Warwick-Banbury road
 runs north to south through the       
 western side of the area.             </content>
