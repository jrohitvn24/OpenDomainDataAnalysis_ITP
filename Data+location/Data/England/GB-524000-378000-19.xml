		<content>{ Doctors }have to travel many miles   
 to visit their patients.Some have     
 their own dispensary to provide pat-  
 ients with medicines.This saves isol- 
 ated country people without private   
 transport,from having to travel into  
 town.There is little Public Transport.
                                       
 Many doctors belong to{L.I.V.E.S.,    
 an emergency service which is used    
 when there has been a bad accident.   
 They are contacted by radio and have  
 essential life-saving equipment in    
 their cars,and are trained to work in 
 emergencies.They save lives because   
 they can give specialist treatment    
 before the ambulances arrive.         
{                                      
{The main aim of health care}in this   
 area is to prevent people getting ill,
 but if they do fall sick,there are    
 many qualified people to help them.   </content>
