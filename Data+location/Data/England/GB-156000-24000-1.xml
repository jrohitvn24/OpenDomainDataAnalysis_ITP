		<title>01RINSEY BEACH</title>
		<content>    Rinsey Beach is to the west of     
 Porthleven. There are cliffs above the
 beach. At the top of the cliffs there 
 is a strip of rough grass and further 
 inland, fields and grassland. There is
 just one farm.                        
    People often go to the beach at    
 Rinsey. Some go surfing there because 
 of the big waves but the sea is       
 dangerous to swim in.                 
    There is a house at the edge of the
 cliff. I would not like to live there 
 myself. There are rock pools on the   
 beach and lots of plants and flowers  
 on the cliffs, especially sea pinks.  
 There is a marsh at Rinsey.           
    Much of the area belongs to the    
 National Trust. A rough track leads   
 from Rinsey village to the small car  
 park. The coastal footpath goes to the
 east and west and another footpath    
 leads down to the beach.              </content>
