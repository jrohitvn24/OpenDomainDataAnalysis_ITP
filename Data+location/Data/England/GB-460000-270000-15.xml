Formed in May 1982, West Haddon Local  
Interest Group brings together native  
villagers and newer arrivals who share 
an interest in the past life of the    
community.                             
We maintain a large photographic       
archive, and are also building up a    
collection of audio tapes containing   
the recollections of a number of long  
esblished village residents. Other     
research is undertaken by individual   
members of the group, and material is  
indexed and stored for future use in   
the mounting of our annual exhibitions.
This years exhibition on the theme     
Village Buildings was a relatively     
small affair, with a slide show        
illustrating changes in the recent     
past  and a photographic display of    
older views.
