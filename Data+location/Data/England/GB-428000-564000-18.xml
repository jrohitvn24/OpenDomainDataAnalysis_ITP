		<content> Most of the{houses}in this area are   
 about{100 yrs}old.They were built for 
{the workers in Leslie's}shipyard.They 
 are{terraced}houses.The{council}bought
 them,then sold off about half at very 
 low prices because they had no modern 
 luxuries.These have been greatly      
{modernised}and the streets            
{pedestrianised}and are now worth about
 Â£15000 _ Â£20000.These streets are Ann,
 Price,Church and Parliament Street.The
 houses the council kept they          
 demolished and in{1974}replaced them  
 with new council housing.These are    
 Cuthbert,William and Lyon Street.These
 are also terraced and many tenants    
 have chosen to buy their council      
 house.On average,there are 4 people   
 per house.Only 2 houses have          
 garages,they were police houses.
