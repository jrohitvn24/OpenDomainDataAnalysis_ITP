		<title>02Essex coastal area ecology</title>
		<content> This area, which comprises saltmarsh, 
 sea and sand-dunes is teeming with    
 wildlife of all sorts. Those who study
 ecology find a great deal to interest 
 them along this sea shore. The        
 saltings are a fine natural haven for 
 saline wildlife being fairly          
 inaccessible to human interference.   
 There are many varieties of plants    
 both in and near the sea. Rock        
 sea-lavender, sea-spurrey, marram     
 grass, samphire, are but a few and the
 masses of seaweed and other oddments  
 cast up by the tide form a li,ited    
 habitat. This provides sustenance for 
 clouds of sand-hoppers and for        
 beetles, flies and small worms. The   
 shore and sand-dune area provide      
 nesting &amp; feeding sites for the little
 tern &amp; waders, notably oystercatchers,
 &amp; ringed plovers.Colchester Museum has
 a complete list of all species sited. </content>
