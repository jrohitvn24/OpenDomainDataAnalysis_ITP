		<title>19Industry The Gravel Pit</title>
		<content>    When we had interviewed at a farm  
 on the{DOMESDAY PROJECT}the farmer    
 took us across a cornfield to a gravel
 pit.We saw a crane digging up earth   
 and then putting it down again.On the 
 back was a thing with caterpillar     
 tracks which churned up the earth.    
 They take top soil off and then move  
 the gravel and then put back the soil 
 again.The next year they grow crops on
 it.There was a notice that said _ "DO 
 NOT DRIVE CARS ON THIS"and the earth  
 looked like sinking sand.The road went
 up a hill and the hill looked as if it
 was made of sand.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
