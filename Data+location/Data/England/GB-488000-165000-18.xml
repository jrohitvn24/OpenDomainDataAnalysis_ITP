		<title>18BOULDISH FARM ESTATE, ASCOT.</title>
		<content>  {Bouldish Farm Estate}was built      
 between 1954 and 1956.  It was the    
 first{council estate}in the Windsor   
 Rural District to have its own shops. 
 It was constructed on land that was   
 originally privately owned and worked 
 as a farm.                            
                                       
   The majority of{buildings}are       
 two-storey terraces which contain four
 to six dwellings.  They have small    
 front gardens and long plots at the   
 rear.  Car parking is on the street as
 there are no garages.  There are some 
 semi-detached houses and some two-    
 storey flats also.  Most of these     
 properties are rented from the        
 Council.  There has been some{modern} 
{development}of three-storey blocks of 
 flats and semi-detached houses to the 
 south of the main estate. This area   
 has garages and more open space.      </content>
