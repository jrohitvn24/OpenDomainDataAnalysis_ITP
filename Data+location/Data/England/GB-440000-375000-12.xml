		<content>  Industry is concentrated along the   
 valley of the river Rother.There has  
 been open cast mining in the area for 
 centuries for both coal and minerals. 
 There has also been extensive         
 quarrying in the area.There is a large
 industrial area in the southern       
 section of the D block consisting of  
 steel works and chemical works.The    
 steel works once covered a very large 
 area but in the last 15 years it has  
 declined rapidly in importance and    
 large sections are closed and         
 derelict.Small businesses have taken  
 over the office buildings.There is a  
 brick works at Barrow Hill.There is a 
 small industrial estate along the     
 Staveley to Eckington road.The        
 chemical works is an expanding        
 industry.
