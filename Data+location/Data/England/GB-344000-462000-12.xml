		<title>12Entertainment in Morecambe.</title>
		<content> One of the best arcades in Morecambe  
 is on the Pier. It has fruit machines 
 and arcade games as well as some pool 
 tables. At the end of the Pier there  
 are facilities for roller skating and 
 open-air dancing. The Pleasure Park is
 at the West End of Morecambe. It has  
 lots of rides like the Log Flume and  
 Cyclone. Happy Mount Park has lots of 
 gardens and games. The games include  
 trampolining, pitch and putt and      
 tennis. Old people like to go there to
 walk in the gardens and watch the     
 games. Morecambe does not have a      
 cinema now because it was closed down 
 in 1984. The nearest cinema is now in 
 Lancaster. Many people enjoy going to 
 Bingo and there are many clubs that   
 cater for this in Morecambe. The      
 biggest is The Granada which was      
 opened recently by Larry Grayson.
