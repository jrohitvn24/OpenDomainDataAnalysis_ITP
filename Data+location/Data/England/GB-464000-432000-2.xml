		<content>      The area is very flat. Most of   
 the land is 7 or 8 metres above sea   
 level, except in the south west corner
 of the block where it slopes down by  
 about 3 metres towards the{River Ouse.
      The villages are built on the    
 slightly higher ground inside the 8   
 metre contour.                        
      Nearly all the land is used for  
{arable farming,}but there seems to be 
 a lot of{trees}in the area, because   
 most fields have trees in the hedges. 
 Some fields have two or three trees in
 the middle showing where hedges used  
 to be.                                
      The only big{buildings}are the   
 old maltings beside the railways. The 
 most noticeable buildings are outside 
 the survey area, Drax Power Station to
 the south, and Hemingbrough church    
 spire to the south east.
