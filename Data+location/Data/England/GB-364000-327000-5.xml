		<content> equipment. He does not have any       
 livestock. He grows a variety of      
 crops. He grows peas which he burns   
 off when they are ready for           
 harvesting, then they are combined    
 and sold to the animal welfare. When  
 he does the potato harvesting he      
 uses conveyor belts. All the good     
 potatoes are packed and sent off to   
 the factory which cleans and packs    
 them in bags for Supermarkets. He     
 sells his bad potatoes to the animal  
 welfare. He grows two kinds of barley:
 Spring which is planted in the Spring,
 and Winter barley which is planted in 
 late Autumn. Also he grows wheat. The 
 grain is harvested and stored (dried  
 if necessary), then sold when the     
 price is right. Another crop he grows 
 is oil seed rape. To help get the best
 from his crops special irrigators are 
 used.These are governed by computers. </content>
