		<content> There are some council houses along   
 the Charlton Road and at East Dean, a 
 few have been bought recently by the  
 tenants. Goodwood Estate owns some of 
 the cottages which house the farm     
 workers in both villages. There have  
 been very few new houses built in the 
 area, a small development in Charlton 
 consisting of six houses and bungalows
 all privately owned. Many of the older
 houses have been extensively          
 modernized.
