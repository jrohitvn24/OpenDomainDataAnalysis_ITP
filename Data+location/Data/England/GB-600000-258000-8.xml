		<title>08HARLESTON,ONEHOUSE CHURCHES</title>
		<content>  Onehouse church was built some way   
from the road and is dedicated to St.  
John the Baptist.It has a round tower  
which dates from the Saxon period.The  
tower has 2 bells which bear the       
dates 1604 and 1673.It was used as a   
watch tower in case of Viking          
attacks.The tower was built            
first,with the church added on         
afterwards.There is a service every    
other Sunday at which the congregation 
is about 30.                           
  Harleston church is one of the few   
churches that doesn't have             
electricity but uses candles.It has a  
thatched roof,and has a congregation   
of about 20.Outside it,there are 5     
metal crosses  representing a family   
who died of scarlet fever,who were too 
poor to afford non-rusting metal as    
crosses.                               
                                       </content>
