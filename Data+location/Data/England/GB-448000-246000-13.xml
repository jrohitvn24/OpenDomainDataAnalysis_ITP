Chipping Warden School used to be a    
hospital for the airfield during the   
second world war. It became a school in
the early 1950's. It is a single       
storey, rambling building with long    
corrdors. At present there are 35      
children in the school. There are three
classrooms. One is an art room, one is 
a maths and science room and the other 
is the language room. We have a big    
hall with a stage and a dining room.   
All these rooms used to be the wards or
the operating theatre of the hospital. 
We have two teachers, Mrs Howse and Mrs
Ormond. The oldest pupil is Neil       
Partis.  We are allowed to roller skate
at playtime. There are lots of pictures
and writing around the school that the 
children have done. The original school
was close to the church and had a small
yard. We have a very big playground.   </content>
