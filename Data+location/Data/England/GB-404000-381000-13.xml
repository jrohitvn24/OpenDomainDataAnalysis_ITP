		<content> New trade is brought into the village 
 by holiday-makers renting cottages.   
 Perhaps they will return again and    
 again, for few places are so friendly.
 Names and faces are rarely forgotten. 
   You must never be in too much of a  
 hurry when shopping. Everyone likes to
 get exactly what they want. And then  
 the time of day can be passed at one  
 of the many coffee mornings or during 
 a visit to the library.               
                                       
 In conclusion, I would just like to   
 add that I have lived here all my     
 life, which gives me a great sense of 
 pride and joy to say I am a true      
 local.
