		<title>04Travel from Plympton</title>
		<content>     You can get to London from        
 Plymouth by train, plane, car and     
 coach. To go by train would cost Â£20  
 for a ticket. The cost of a ticket to 
 travel by plane would be Â£92 return.  
 Planes fly from Plymouth to Newquay   
 then onto London Heathrow. The planes 
 fly four times a day and it takes     
 about 1.5hrs to fly to London. A car  
 would take four hrs, as would a coach.
 I would prefer to fly to London.      
     If you want to travel from        
 Plympton to Plymouth today you can do 
 it quite easily. You hop into a car   
 and zoom away. You can get to Plymouth
 using a car, bicycle, bus or coach.   
 There are two bus services that go to 
 Plymouth. These are the number 20 and 
 21. It will cost 35p for a single     
 childs fare to Plymouth.
