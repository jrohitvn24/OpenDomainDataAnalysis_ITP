		<title>07The Writers of Ampleforth</title>
		<content>{ Mr.Walker}writes about the police in 
 his 'Constable' series and local      
 topics. He also writes a lot of       
 articles for newspapers. Seven of his 
 books have been translated into       
 Spanish, Italian, Icelandic and       
 German. His publisher, Robert Hale of 
 London, will only accept two books a  
 year under his real name, so he writes
 under some pseudonyms.                
                                       
{ Mr.Spence}lives in the Ampleforth    
 College post office. He has written 32
 westerns, war stories, guide books in 
 collaboration with his wife. He likes 
 doing something he enjoys as a career.
 He writes on a word-processor which   
 makes editing more efficient. He      
 normally knows the outline of a       
 fictional book before he starts and   
 then the characters in the story      
 virtually take control.               </content>
