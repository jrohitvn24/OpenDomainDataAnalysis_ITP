		<title>08A FARMER'S  DAY</title>
		<content> The farmer is an early riser in order 
 to milk the cows before breakfast. The
 milk is cooled in a bulk tank and     
 collected daily by an MMB road tanker.
 After breakfast he will clean out the 
 byre or milking parlour. In winter the
 farmer will feed any other livestock  
 housed inside.                        
 After lunch other jobs need attention,
 mending fences, sawing logs and       
 machinery servicing.                  
 Later in the afternoon the cows need  
 milking again and the farmer is ready 
 for supper. Later he will check his   
 animals and in summer there is still  
 work to do such as collecting hay,    
 making silage or necessary repairs to 
 buildings or equipment.               
 And so to bed.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
