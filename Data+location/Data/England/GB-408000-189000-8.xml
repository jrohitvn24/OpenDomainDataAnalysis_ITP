		<title>08WATKINS CORNER.PURTON STOKE</title>
		<content>  Mr Stephen Rodway,a salt merchant of 
 Cricklade, was returning home from    
 Wootton Bassett on 7th May 1819.At    
 about 9.30 pm he was waylaid and shot 
 and then robbed. Robert Turner Watkins
 and his brother Edward were charged   
 with the murder.It was proved that    
 Watkins had sent his ladyfriend a Â£5  
 note which was marked and could be    
 identified by Rodway's son_in_law.    
 Robert was found guilty.He was taken  
 as near as possible to the place where
 the murder was,where he would be hung.
 So scaffolding and gallows had been   
 erected.A large crowd of men,women and
 children, estimated between 5_15000,  
 had collected to witness the          
 execution.                            
 Then a violent thunderstorm broke and 
 lasted for half an hour, after which  
 the crowd dispersed quietly, and there
 Robert Watkins's body hung to rot.    </content>
