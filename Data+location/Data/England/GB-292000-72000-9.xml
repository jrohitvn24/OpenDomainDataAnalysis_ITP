		<title>09TEIGNMOUTH'S POPULATION</title>
		<content> The biggest percentage of under 16's  
 are situated in the West of Teigmouth 
 e.g. from Bitton House to Kingsway.   
 This is because W. Teignmouth is      
 mainly occupied by families.          
   The largest amount of old age       
 pensioners live in the East of        
 Teignmouth, but closely followed by   
 the Central and North areas.          
   The largest percentage of cars per  
 household is found in the Northern    
 part of the town. This is because the 
 Northern part has less unemployment.  
   The largest percentage of           
 unemployment is found in the Western  
 part of Teignmouth.                   
   The most privately owned houses are 
 in the East and North parts and the   
 Western area contains most of the     
 council houses and flats.
