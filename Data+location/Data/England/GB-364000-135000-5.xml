		<title>05 AMENITIES IN BRUTON AREA.</title>
		<content>    Many new houses have been built    
in the area,mainly in the nearby       
settlement of Castle Cary.Although     
we have these new estates,we are       
lacking in suitable amenities.We       
need to have a recreation centre,      
to include sports and music and        
a general youth club's facilities.     
There are plenty of schools in the     
area and we are able to use their      
facilities.                            
      The farmers in the area have     
modernised their methods,but much      
else is still quite traditional.       
The shops are many and small and are   
behind in sales,compared to a large    
urban environment.Most jobs in the     
area are inherited and it is not       
easy for newcomers to find work.Most   
employment is in agriculture.It is     
a traditional area and happy for this.
