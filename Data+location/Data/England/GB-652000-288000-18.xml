		<content>There is a concentration of {shops} at 
G.R. 535905.  Many of these shops are  
small family businesses and have been  
serving the local community for many   
years.  Although there are two small   
self- service stores, most of the shops
specialise in particular commodities   
and offer a personal service. Of the   
four {public houses} in the area the   
Trowel and Hammer at G.R. 539 907 is by
far the oldest, originating from the   
the 17th cent. The Tramway Hotel at    
G.R. 537 905 is so named because it was
at the terminus of the {tramway} which 
ran from Lowestoft to Pakefield until  
1931. The local bus service has stops  
very close to the shops. For people    
living at the eastern end of Carlton   
Colville at G.R. 524 905 there are a   
few shops at this point. They do not   
offer as wide a variety of goods as the
shops at Pakefield.                    </content>
