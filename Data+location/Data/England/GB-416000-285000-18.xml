		<content> There are seven churches in the area  
 all of them without a spire or a      
 tower. The churches are small and the 
 ones in the Chelmsley Wood estate are 
 less than twenty years old.           
    70% of the people questioned admit 
 that they have no religous beliefs but
 many of them do go to church for      
 weddings and funerals. Only 5% go to a
 place of worship more than fifteen    
 times in a year and 10% never go.     
    The list below shows the different 
 religions in the area:                
     Church of England    20%
