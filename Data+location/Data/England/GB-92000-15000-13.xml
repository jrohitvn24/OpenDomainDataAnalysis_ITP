		<title>13LAUNCH TO ST.MARTINS I.O.S.</title>
		<content>    Our launch is called the Gugh and  
 is very important because it is our   
 life-line.It brings all the things we 
 need;gas,oil,groceries,post,livestock 
 the list is endless.The launch also   
 takes things out,such as boxes of     
 flowers,the post,bulbs,cattle and new 
 potatoes.The Gugh used to be an old   
 naval launch,in 1984 it had a refit.It
 was built in 1944 in Ipswich,it weighs
 23.78 metric tonnes without any       
 cargo,and it can carry 10 metric      
 tonnes of cargo.It is about 15 metres 
 long and can carry 49 people including
 the crew.The Gugh is very tough and   
 can put to sea in nearly all          
 weathers.It usually comes once each   
 weekday but twice on a Thursday to    
 allow shoppers a day on the main      
 island.The service is operated by the 
 Isles of Scilly Steamship Company and 
 links with their ferry to the mainland</content>
