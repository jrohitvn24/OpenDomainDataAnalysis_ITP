		<title>04THE ARRETON VALLEY NURSERIES</title>
		<content>     Much of the Arreton Valley is     
 devoted to the growing of commercial  
 crops.  There are a number of         
 nurseries that grow everything from   
 produce to garden shrubs and plants.  
 Several acres of land are under glass.
  The area is the centre of growing on 
 the Isle of Wight and the nurseries   
 supply the florists and fruit and     
 vegetable shops on the Island and the 
 produce etc. is also transported to   
 the mainland.                         
     The nursery industry has only been
 developed into a commercially viable  
 proposition during the past 20 years. 
 All the present centres have been     
 established during this time.  One    
 such nursery is Springbank run by the 
 Hall family.                          
     The Arreton Valley is ideal for   
 this industry because it enjoys a high
 intensity of light.                   </content>
