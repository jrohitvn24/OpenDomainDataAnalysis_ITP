		<title>20FAMILY LIFE - SCOTT</title>
		<content> I am 9 years old and I live in        
 Godshill.I have one brother called    
 Darren who is 15. We all get up at 7  
 o'clock and have breakfast. My brother
 and I each have a boiled egg with     
 bread and butter and a cup of tea. My 
 Mum has cornflakes. She works at the  
 Great Budbridge Manor tomato nursery. 
 My Dad drives a lorry for the County  
 Council. He is just tarring some roads
 now. I go to Godshill County Primary  
 School until September when I will go 
 to Ventnor Middle School for 4 years. 
 Then I go on to Medina High School    
 where my brother is now. Our house is 
 about 20 years old. We rent it from   
 the County Council. It has 3 bedrooms,
 one living room, a kitchen and a bath-
 room. We have a brown car called an   
 Austin 1300 which we bought second    
 hand about a year ago.
