		<title>11TOCKHOLES' TWO CHURCHES</title>
		<content>      The Church of England Church in  
 Tockholes, a village near Blackburn,  
 is called St. Stephen's and the       
 Priest-in-charge is the Rev. Harry    
 Pugh. The Church is over 1300 years   
 old. It was built in A.D. 640, rebuilt
 1494, restored 1620, rebuilt in 1833  
 and again in 1964. A graveyard in poor
 condition adjoins the church. There   
 are about 500 people in the parish.   
      The other Church in Tockholes is 
 the United Reformed Church. The       
 Minister is the Rev. Brian Jolly. This
 Sunday, June 30th 1985, it will be the
 323rd. anniversary. The Rev. Jolly has
 three Churches, this is because there 
 are not enough clergy to go round. In 
 this parish, there are only about 25  
 people. This Church also has          
 a graveyard and this is also in bad   
 condition, the grass being very       
 overgrown.                            </content>
