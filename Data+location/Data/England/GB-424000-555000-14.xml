		<content> Birtley is policed by three community 
 policemen and two C.I.D. officers. The
 police prefer to walk their beat as   
 they feel this gives them the         
 opportunity to keep in close contact  
 with the residents of Birtley.        
    Serious crime is rare in the area  
 although incidents of criminal damage 
 are high as are house and shop        
 breaking. Most offenders are teenage  
 boys. Glue sniffing is also a problem 
 but by visiting schools and youth     
 centres the police hope to lessen     
 these problems. Six or seven incidents
 are reported daily to Gateshead       
 headquarters and these are passed to  
 local police. Most people appear to be
 very satisfied with the way Birtley is
 policed.
