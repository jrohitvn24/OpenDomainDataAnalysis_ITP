    The spa had/has a spa or spring.   
{Spring Wood}could be so called due to 
 the presence of a spring or stream. It
 could perhaps be due to early budding 
 trees.                                
   {Waskey Wood}is of uncertain        
 etimology. The 'was' element means a  
 wet place or swamp and comes from the 
 Old English 'waesse'. Thus Waskey Wood
 could be on, or near boggy or wet     
 ground. It could also could be from a 
 personal name - Mr. Waskey's wood,    
 indicating the owner of the wood.     
   {East Holme House :}The word        
 'holm(e)' is used to describe low     
 lying land by a river. Thishouse is   
 sited on this type of land next to the
 Tees on its eastern bank. Thus the    
 meaning is 'house on the low ground   
 east of the river.
