		<title>16TAUNTON CASTLE</title>
		<content>  Taunton Castle is believed to date   
 from Norman times.During the Civil War
 it was both a Royalist stronghold and 
 later a Parliamentary garrison.It was 
 used after the Monmouth Rebellion in  
 1685 for the Bloody Assizes which     
 Judge Jeffreys held for captured      
 rebels.This year is the 300 hundred   
 anniversary of the rebellion and      
 Taunton held a Son et Lumiere on      
 Castle Green.Four loudspeakers were   
 used to tell the story and floodlights
 lit up walls and trees in different   
 colours. Smoke rose from behind a     
 wall and the chopping of an axe was   
 heard,the end of the Duke of          
 Monmouth.Somerset County Museum is now
 situated in the castle building and   
 the grounds now contain a hotel, two  
 public houses,a cafe,a car park,a     
 bingo hall,electricity showrooms and  
 the bus station.                      </content>
