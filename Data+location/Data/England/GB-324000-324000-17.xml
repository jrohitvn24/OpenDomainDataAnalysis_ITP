 Trefonen playing field,which is       
 nicknamed by the local children       
 "THE PIT",used to be an old coal mine 
 and you can still see the remains of  
 it hiding under the brambles and the  
 long grass.The land was once glebe    
 land,which is land that is owned by   
 the church.It is now used as a sports 
 field where lots of activities take   
 place such as football,cricket,       
 rounders and skittles.The local school
 has use of it.The village playing     
 field was bought buy Oswestry borough 
 council, in 1978.The council are      
 responsible for the up keep of the    
 field and nothing can be built on the 
 field without permission.
