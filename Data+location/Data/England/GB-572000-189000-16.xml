		<title>16BASILDON NE: DRUG ADDICTION</title>
		<content> One of the dangers facing young people
 today is that of drug addiction. A    
 menace which kills, the penalties for 
 distribution are not severe enough to 
 discourage the peddlers of death. Many
 in Basildon are addicts through       
 ignorance, and the boredom and apathy 
 brought about by unemployment.        
                                       
 Now it appears that children of junior
 school age are becoming addicted. They
 may be led into addiction by an older 
 acquaintance, or by experimentation   
 because it is a "grown-up" thing to   
 do.                                   
                                       
 The numbers involved are difficult to 
 estimate, but it is essential that    
 children are educated, not to scare   
 them, but to allow them to judge the  
 dangers for themselves.
