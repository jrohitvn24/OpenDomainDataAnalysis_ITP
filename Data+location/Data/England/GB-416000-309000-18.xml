My day at camp started at 7 o'clock.I  
got up,got dressed and went to the     
farmhouse.Breakfast was ready so I sat 
down at the table and began to eat.    
After breakfast I did my job of the    
day.After the jobs Mr.Mitchell came and
told us what to do.We got ourselves    
ready to go.We walked over the moorlan-
ds looking at all different kinds of   
stone and grasses.We discovered many   
different things on our walk although  
it was very,very tiring.After our walk 
we went back to the campsite and waited
for our tea which we were all ready    
for.After tea I played quiet games with
my friends and talked until it was time
for bed.We walked upto our tents and   
climbed into our wanted beds.That was  
the end of my day.
