{                                      
 We did a{survey about leisure.}First  
 we went round to all the classes and  
 asked "What you do in your spare      
 time?"                                
 Ten children liked watching televison 
 best from class four. In class two    
 they liked watching televison too.    
 Class one watched televison as well.  
 Thirty seven people liked watching    
 televison in Upottery school.         
 Another popular activity was drawing  
 which was as popular as swimming in   
 most of the classes.                  
 Playing various outdoor games was also
 very popular.                         
  One activity which a number mentioned
 was helping their parents do jobs     
 around the house or farm.
