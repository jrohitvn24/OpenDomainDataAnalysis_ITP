    We moved into Bramfield in July    
 1983.                                 
    We had been living in a flat for   
 eight years on a very busy estate.    
    The change was really lovely for   
 me,I felt for a long while as if I    
 were on holiday.                      
    Our three children took a while to 
 settle in and adjust to village life. 
    Our two younger children attend a  
 neighbouring village and our eldest   
 son attends the secondary school on   
 the Sele Farm Estate.                 
    All three children travel to school
 by coach.                             
    I work at a school in Hertford,I   
 get a lift in, in the mornings and go 
 home by taxi.
