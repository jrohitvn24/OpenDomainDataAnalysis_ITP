		<title>16VILLAGE LIFE,SPARSHOLT.</title>
		<content>  The village we live in is called     
 Sparsholt,which is about five miles   
 north of Winchester.There are a lot   
 of old people in the village who have 
 lived there all their lives.          
  Living in a village is good because  
 you know everybody and it is friendly 
 and peaceful.There are quite a number 
 of children to play with.             
  From our village you are able to go  
 for walks in the country and see      
 animals and flowers that you would not
 see in towns or cities.Crab Wood is   
 only a quarter of a mile from the     
 village.It is normally a quiet village
 but at the moment some builders are   
 building a new village hall for the   
 primary school to use and anyone else 
 who wants to hire it.The main         
 disadvantage is that there is only a  
 new post office with a small shop     
 attached to it.                       </content>
