		<title>08VILLAGES IN GENERAL</title>
		<content>   Villages in the area are usually    
 sparse and lowly populated, appart    
 from villages on the main road, whose 
 population is bigger. The population  
 of the villages that are not on the   
 main road usually are farmers or work 
 as laborers. The houses of the        
 villages on the main road are usually 
 used as holiday cottages.             
   In winter villages can be cut off   
 because of snow drifts and ice.       
 Isolated villages get cut off for     
 about 2 days every year but every so  
 often there is a bad spell and even   
 the villages on the main road get cut 
 off for about a week. This last       
 happened in the winter of 1981.       
   Since the villages are about 12     
 miles away from Hereford, the price of
 food .etc. is very expensive, and new 
 products arrive late.
