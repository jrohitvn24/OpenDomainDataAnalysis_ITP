		<title>11Shopping in Rutland</title>
		<content>    For the purposes of this survey,   
 Harringworth is included with the two 
 Rutland villages of Bisbrooke and     
 Seaton. It is the only one of the     
 three villages with a shop. Local     
 people use this shop, but many go into
 the neighbouring towns of Uppingham,  
 Stamford, and Corby for main grocery  
 shopping in supermarkets.             
                                       
    The Harringworth shop is a Post    
 Office and General Store. It is also  
 an off-licence. Fruit and vegetables  
 are bought from Uppingham Market to be
 resold there. The shop also sells     
 daily papers, sweets, toys, general   
 foods and Calor gas. It acts as a     
 branch of the National Savings Bank   
 ans National Giro Bank. It does not   
 sell eggs, furniture or clothes.
