		<title>02COUNTRY LIFE - A SCHOOLGIRL</title>
		<content> A day in my life begins at 8.30       
 Saturday morning and I have just woken
 up. I get dressed,washed and have my  
 breakfast, then set off for my music  
 lesson at 9.15am. Mum has to take me  
 as usual although I sometimes cycle.  
 An hour later Mum picks me up and then
 drops me in town. I stay in Colchester
 for two hours and then return home. In
 the afternoon I go riding on my pony. 
 There is little else to do in this    
 area. I never go out much because     
 everywhere is too far away and I have 
 to rely on my parents to take me.     
 Although it is peaceful and there's   
 nobody to bother you, the evenings are
 boring with nothing to do and         
 sometimes I wish I lived nearer my    
 friends where there is more to do.
