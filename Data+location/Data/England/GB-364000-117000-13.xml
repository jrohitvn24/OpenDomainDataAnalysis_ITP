		<content> The A30 runs through the block which  
 makes most places accessible to local 
 people.                               
 Most people work outside the area and 
 go to their place of work by car.Many 
 people share transport to keep costs  
 down.                                 
 There are no secondary schools in this
 block therefore all children over the 
 age of 11 have to travel out of the   
 area to go to school.They go to       
 Wincanton School by school bus.Those  
 going to Yeovil have to depend on     
 public transport.                     
 The bus service is considered to be   
 adequate for a rural area,there are   
 busses every hour to Yeovil but these 
 stop running at 7.30pm.There are 2    
 busses per day to Wincanton.          
 There is a British Rail station in    
 Sherborne and a National Coach station
 in Yeovil.                            </content>
