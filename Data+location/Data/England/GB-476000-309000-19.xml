		<content>We bought our next door neighbours     
house when she died aged about 93.  It 
used to be the old Quaker meeting      
place.  It had to have a lot done to   
it.  First we got rid of the old oil   
tank.  The house had two doors, one at 
the front and one at the side.  We     
blocked both doors.  We had problems   
fillling in the front door because it  
had a porch and the front of the house 
had a pattern so we built the front so 
the pattern continued.                 
                                       
We had to put new windows in, four     
downstairs, two upstairs, two on the   
side, and one patio door at the back.  
We have sevenrooms, four upstairs and  
three down and a hall.  Our old house  
has three rooms upstairs.  We knocked  
through to the other house to make it  
into one house.
