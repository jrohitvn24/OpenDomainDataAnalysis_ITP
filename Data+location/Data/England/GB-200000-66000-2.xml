		<content> Statistics we have gathered show that 
 we are an aging population,with the   
 implications that entails-falling     
 school rolls and an extra load on     
 welfare facilities.There is a slight  
 imbalance between male and female-85  
 females,79 males.The immigrants       
 outnumber the Cornish-Cornish 78,     
 others 86.The largest group of        
 residents(48)have been in the area for
 5 years or less,22 have always lived  
 here and 41 have lived here for over  
 20 years.Much will depend on whether  
 the newcomers have integrated with    
 local people.Most seem keen to join   
 in.A low level of unemployment is     
 accounted for by the fact that most   
 farms are family businesses.Out of 105
 people,5 were unemployed,30 retired,19
 were self-employed,19 were at school  
 or college and 32 were wage or salary 
 earners.                              </content>
