    My house is a terraced house.We use
to have a toilet outside, but we have  
got a toilet inside now.We have two    
bedrooms one for me and one for my mum 
and dad.I have to go through my mum's  
bedroom to get to the toilet from my   
room.                                  
    We eat in the backroom because the 
table is in there.We have got a gas    
cooker and a gas fire.We have two      
gardens, one at the front and one at   
the back.Both gardens are small.       
    Our street is noisy because they   
own motor bikes next door but one,so   
our street is very noisy at night.I    
can't get to sleep at night with them  
bombing up and down.
