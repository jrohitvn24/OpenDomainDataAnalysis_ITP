		<title>07A RIVER SEVERN LOCK</title>
		<content> The{River Severn}runs North South     
 though this area. At{Grimley}there is 
 a{weir}and a{lock.}Because boats      
 cannot go through the weir they use   
 the{lock.}There is a{lock keeper}who  
 works about 14 hours a day, from      
 8.00a.m to about 11p.m. He has been in
 charge of the{lock}for 21 years and he
 enjoys his work. The{lock}is now      
 mechanised, it runs by hydraulics,    
 although at one time it was worked by 
 hand.About 8,500 boats go through the 
 lock each month, mostly{holiday       
{traffic}so the lock is busiest in the 
 Summer.The biggest boats are{steamers 
 and the smallest{narrow boats.}Most of
 the narrow boats are made into holiday
 boats and colourfully decorated.      
{School children,youth organisations   
 and{adults}are welcome to see how the 
 lock works which is especially        
 worthwhile when boats travel through. </content>
