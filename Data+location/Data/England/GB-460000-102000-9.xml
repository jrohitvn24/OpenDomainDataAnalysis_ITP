		<title>09WHALE ISLAND</title>
		<content> Whale Island is an almost flat island 
 of 79 acres situated in Portsmouth    
 Harbour.  This island is man-made from
 soil taken from Portsmouth Dockyard by
 convict labour and covers two smaller 
 islands.  It was purpose built to     
 house {HMS Excellent. }This naval     
 shore base is famous as a School of   
 Naval Gunnery, but has recently       
 changed its role to a School of Naval 
 General Training, the training being  
 in Internal Security, Leadership,     
 Nuclear Biological Defence and Damage 
 Control.  The Royal Naval Display Team
 is also trained there, and training in
 Ceremonial Gunnery (Field Gun Crews   
 and Gun Carriage Crews for state      
 funerals) also takes place there.     
 Training also in firefighting and     
 signals will also take place there in 
 the near future.
