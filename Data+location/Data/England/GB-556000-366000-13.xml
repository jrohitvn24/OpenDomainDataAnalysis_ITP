		<title>13Clerk to the Parish Council</title>
		<content> Mr.Barrell lives down Sea Lane.He was 
 a policeman for 30 years so he knows  
 about the law and can advise the      
 parish councillors on legal matters.  
 He works in Council Offices near the  
 bus station on Skegness Road.He has a 
 secretary in training to take his     
 place when he is ill or retires. He   
 carries out decisions of the          
 councillors so he is really the       
 village manager.His work includes     
 everything from balancing the books to
 choosing which type of disinfectant to
 use in the public toilets.Ingoldmells 
 is one of the few parish councils     
 owning the beach and foreshore within 
 its boundary.In addition it owns a    
 caravan site,2 holiday flats,several  
 shops and a bus station amongst other 
 things.To run these concerns he has 17
 staff in summer and 7 in winter so    
 consequently he is a very busy man.   </content>
