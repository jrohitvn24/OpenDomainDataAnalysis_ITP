   In our area there are only three    
 public houses which is fairly         
 surprising.                           
   Since  the population is only about 
 seven hundred and fifty people strong 
 this number is interesting.           
   Farmers, however are very well known
 for their great love of drinking and  
 many often go down to the local public
 house for a drink.                    
  In the area many people will go down 
 to the public house to meet their     
 collegues with a drink at the weekend.
   The people do not drink a great deal
 at home and it is only when           
 entertaining that they get out any    
 alcoholic drink.
