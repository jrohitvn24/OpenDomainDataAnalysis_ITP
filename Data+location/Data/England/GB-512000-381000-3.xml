		<content>    Christianity is represented in this
 area by the Church of England and     
 Methodism.                            
    There are small parish churches at 
 both{East and West Torrington.}Both   
 consist of a nave, chancel and bell-  
 cote. Both were heavily restored in   
 the mid-nineteenth century.{East      
{Torrington}contains remnants of       
 fifteenth century windows, while{West 
{Torrington}has re-used masonry and a  
 Norman font.                          
    Methodism was once strong in this  
 area, and still has a following,      
 though not enough to keep most of the 
 chapels open. At{Bleasby Moor}the     
 former chapel has been converted to a 
 private house. In{West Torrington}one 
 chapel is derelict, but the other is  
 still in use, its school-room doubling
 as the Community Centre.
