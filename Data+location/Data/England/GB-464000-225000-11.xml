		<title>11Employment in Twyford Area</title>
		<content> The main centre of employment in the  
 area is the{London Brick Company}at   
 Calvert (3 miles away) and farming in 
 and around the villages.Also to be    
 found but employing fewer people are  
 the more traditional jobs such as coal
 merchants,grain-mill,a nursing        
 home,Public Houses,chimney sweep,     
 garage,small builders,local authority 
 and public service workers. Many      
 people travel away each day for work  
 to Bicester,Buckingham,Aylesbury,     
 Milton Keynes and even London.To do   
 so,they have to rely mainly on their  
 own transport or use local bus        
 services,where available.A few of the 
 larger firms provide transport to the 
 area.                                 
 At present unemployment is low        
 although some is expected at the      
 Brickworks in the near future.
