		<content> On Friday 19th July the whole of      
 Sennen school went down to the beach  
 to talk to the lifeguards and to have 
 a swim.We went to the lifeguards hut  
 and they came out to meet us.We sat   
 down on the sand and they introduced  
 themselves.One lifeguard showed us the
 equipment they use and also a thing   
 called a torpedo.It was to help people
 to float if they were in the water.Two
 of the lifeguards went down to the sea
 to give us a demonstration .One man   
 swam out and pretended to be drowning.
 The other one got a surfboard and     
 went out and saved him.The next time  
 they went out in their motor powered  
 dinghy and did another rescue.We said 
 goodbye and all went for a swim.After 
 our visit we shall all be very careful
 when we go to the beach.
