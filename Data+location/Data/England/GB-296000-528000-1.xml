		<title>01The Block - a description</title>
		<content> The Western half of the Block         
 comprises the Solway Firth; the       
 Eastern half is part of the Cumbrian  
 coast and this is virtually bisected  
 by the River Derwent's Estuary.       
 With the exception of the disused slag
 bank, south of the estuary, the whole 
 of the area is{just above sea level.  
 The 'Northside' area, once the site of
 the 'Oldside Iron Works' has been     
 landscaped to provide a recreational  
 area.                                 
 The populated area of the Block is    
 virtually confined to one grid square 
 in the South-East. In this area of    
 Workington are the{oldest residences. 
 In an area of{high unemployment}the   
 main employers are the engineering    
 works, the dock and the industrial    
 estate. A major{reclamation scheme}is 
 being undertaken to improve the area.
