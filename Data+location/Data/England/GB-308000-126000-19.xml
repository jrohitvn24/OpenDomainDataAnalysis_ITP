		<content> Mr.Hill worked at Wiveliscombe        
 Secondary Modern as a general duties  
 teacher until a careers post was      
 created in 1962.In those days a child 
 had only to chose the type of job and 
 suitable locality.                    
 The oil crisis of 1974 caused the     
 warning light to flicker and from 1977
 the employment screw tightened.However
 small employers kept in touch with    
 Kingsmead Comprehensive as it now was.
 Friendly relationships were           
 strengthened by careers evenings and  
 regular talks,not only by potential   
 employers but representatives of the  
 16+ educational establishments in     
 Taunton.Mr.Hill's record of success   
 where no one has left without a job or
 place for training or F.E. has won    
 coverage by the national media and won
 him the M.B.E.in the 1984 Birthday    
 Honours list.                         </content>
