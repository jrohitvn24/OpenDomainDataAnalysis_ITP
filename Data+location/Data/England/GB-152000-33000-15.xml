		<content> Treloweth Farm, St.Erth               
      The farmhouse dates about        
 l72O,this has been estblished since   
 the chimney stack is built from local 
 bricks which were only produced after 
 that date. The farmhouse, once        
 thatched, is a listed property and    
 much photographed - as in the         
 A.A.farmhouse guide.                  
      The farm of approximately l8O    
 acres, which was mixed up until some  
 l5 years ago, is given over to        
 Guernsey cow dairy farming, however a 
 few of the cattle are kept for beef.On
 the farm currently are 3 Guernsey     
 bulls which has meant 23 calves. The  
 tenant farmer and his family have been
 in the house for three generations    
 from the turn of this century. The    
 farm belongs to Lord St.Levan who owns
 a good deal of land in the county and 
 elsewhere.                            </content>
