		<title>16TOURISM</title>
		<content> Bath naturally attracts thousands of  
 tourists from all over the world      
 throughout the year. It would be fair 
 to say that Bath depends on tourism   
 for prosperity. The wide variety of   
 shops back this up together with the  
 museums, cafes, retaurants, cinemas   
 and places of historic interest which 
 all cater for the needs of the        
 tourist. Away from the city centre the
 number of hotels and restaurants      
 increases, encouraged by lower rates  
 but still with good acess. Away from  
 the river flood plain the land slopes 
 up towards the south and the land use 
 is predominantly residential. Traffic 
 is a major problem for this GEORGIAN  
 city in the C20th _ there are too many
 cars,lorries and coaches and too few  
 places to put them. At Christmas a    
 park and ride scheme is operated but  
 the problem is there all year.        </content>
