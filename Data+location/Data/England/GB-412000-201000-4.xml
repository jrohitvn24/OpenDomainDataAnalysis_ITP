		<title>04COMMUNITY EVENTS IN FAIRFORD</title>
		<content>   In June l985 there was an important 
 music festival to raise money for the 
 rebuilding of the church organ.   In  
 conjunction with this there was a     
 flower festival in the church and a   
 wine party in Fairford House.   An    
 annual event that draws crowds to     
 Fairford for a weekend each August is 
 the{Traction Engine Rally. }  These   
 engines, which were once used on      
 farms, come from all over the country.
 At the rally there are veteran cars,  
 an old-fashioned fair, steam organs,  
 side-shows and various craft stalls.  
 There are smaller events happening    
 throughout the year at Fairford.      
 The Palmer Hall is used for jumble    
 sales, parties, discos and roller     
 skating.   Discos are held at the     
 Youth Club.   Farmor's School and     
 Fairford Primary School have annual   
 fetes plus other attractions.         </content>
