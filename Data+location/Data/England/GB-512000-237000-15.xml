		<title>15A CAMPTON SMALL FARM</title>
		<content> The first William Lamb came here in   
 1805.Ever since then it has always    
 been farmed by a William Lamb, going  
 from father to son.                   
    The present William Lamb farms 120 
 acres at Campton Bury and 20 acres at 
 Meppershall.                          
    The crops to be harvested this year
 are:-                                 
      Winter wheat 125 acres           
      Winter barley 43 acres.          
    The remaining land is grass which  
 is eaten by three ponies.Sometimes,in 
 other years, different crops are      
 grown,such as beans,brussels and      
 potatoes.                             
     Mr Lamb farms the land himself    
 except at harvest time, and then he   
 employs a man to cart the corn while  
 he drives the combine harvester.The   
 grain is then sold to the millers.
