		<content>{Stetchworth}Parish Church is          
 St.Peter's.Parts of it are Early      
 English,so it is at least 700 years   
 old,other parts are Perpendicular and 
 early and late 19th Century.At present
 it is in need of substantial          
 repair.Stetchworth also has a{United  
{Reformed Church}which has a Sunday    
 School.                               
{Woodditton}Parish church is called    
 St.Mary's.It used to be made of wood  
 but it has been replaced by flint.The 
 church is built on higher ground about
 a mile from the centre of the         
 village.It seems that the village has 
 moved away from the church as the     
 forests have been cut and the land    
 cultivated.The church used to have    
 four bells but now has five.The       
 advantage of the extra bell is that   
 120 changes can be rung against only  
 24 with four bells.                   </content>
