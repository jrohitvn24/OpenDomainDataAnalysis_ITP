		<title>05Entertainment in Upperton</title>
		<content> Upperton and Brightwell Baldin do not 
 contain any cineamas, theatres or     
 other places of entertainment.  So    
 most people have hobbies like riding, 
 gardening, sewing ad painting.  Two   
 ladies we talked to did sewing for    
 Drapes of Watlington.  In the summer  
 there are several fetes, in Brightwell
 and other villages.  Also every       
 Tuesday at the manor house at         
 Britwell, the swimming pool is open   
 for people from the nearby villages.  
 Mothers take it in turns to look after
 all the young children for one day    
 each week.  They then have the rest of
 the week free.  If people  wish to go 
 to the cinema or theatre they would   
 have to go to a town like Wallingford,
 Henley or Oxford.  The nearest place  
 for clubs in Watlington, except for   
 the women's Christian Fellowship in   
 Brihtwell Baldwin.                    </content>
