		<content> Windmill Field has been my home for   
 131 years. I have been a home for many
 creatures. Bats, mice and birds have  
 dwelt within my cold grey walls. I    
 have been a meeting place for many    
 people, I protect them when they meet 
 inside me. My garden is a refuge for  
 bodies. Bodies whose spirits left them
 many years ago. I have witnessed many 
 ordeals. Some of them were sad, like  
 funerals, some were very happy, like  
 weddings and baptisms. When there is a
 wedding, people ring my bell, as they 
 do on Sunday mornings. I only have one
 bell in my bell tower, and a rope     
 dangling down into my body. Inside I  
 have a voice. It is the organ. The    
 organist presses down the keys and I  
 sing to the tune of the song.
