		<title>02THORPE-LE-SOKEN HIGH STREET</title>
		<content> THE HIGH STREET IS A VERY BUSY        
 THOROUGHFARE, BEING PART OF THE MAIN  
 ROUTE FROM COLCHESTER TO THE COASTAL  
 RESORTS OF FRINTON-ON-SEA AND         
 WALTON-ON-THE-NAZE. AT WEEKENDS DURING
 JULY AND AUGUST TRAFFIC JAMS HAVE BEEN
 KNOWN TO STRETCH BACK AS FAR AS WEELEY
 AND KIRBY CROSS. IT BECOMES ALMOST    
 IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEDESTRIANS TO CROSS   
 THE ROAD AND FOR MANY YEARS THE PARISH
 COUNCIL HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR A    
 PEDESTRIAN CROSSING BUT TO NO AVAIL.  
 MOST DAY TO DAY SHOPPING CAN BE DONE  
 IN THE HIGH STREET AS THERE ARE TWO   
 BAKERIES, A BUTCHER, A GREENGROCER, A 
 POST OFFICE, NEWSAGENT AND SMALL      
 SUPERMARKET. REGRETFULLY, THE BRANCH  
 OF THE NATWEST BANK CLOSED DOWN       
 LAST YEAR BUT THREE BUILDING SOCIETIES
 NOW HAVE AGENCIES IN THE VILLAGE.     
 THERE ARE FOUR PUBLIC HOUSES, THE ROSE
 AND CROWN, MAIDS HEAD, CROWN AND BELL.</content>
