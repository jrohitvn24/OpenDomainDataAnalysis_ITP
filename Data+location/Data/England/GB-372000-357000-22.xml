<title>22The Wheelock By-Pass</title>
<content>

The Wheelock By-Pass was finally built in 1997-1998 after a long period of campaigning by local people. No-one's house was demolished. The eventual cost of the 1.65 miles of road was Â£11.5m.&lt;br />&lt;br />At the time of building the by-pass removed most of the 17000 vehicles per day - 1 in 7 being an HGV - which were passing through the village centre. However, as the overall nationwide number of vehicle journeys has increased, the number of vehicles passing through Wheelock has risen again, though not as high as pre-by-pass (yet?).   &lt;br />
