		<title>15FARMING</title>
		<content>{Farming}is the major economic         
 activity. The landscape is dominated  
 by improved grazing land supporting   
 flocks of sheep or herds of beef or   
 dairy cattle. In Summer certain fields
 are noted for providing a hay crop,   
 but{silage}is the predominant winter  
 fodder crop. Fewer farmers are{dairy  
{producers}owing to the quotas on milk 
 production recently imposed by the    
 European Community. The efficiency of 
 farmers varies. Some are poor and     
 their farms{ill-equipped.}Other farms 
 are{highly mechanised,}with electric  
 milking machines. Most are small in   
 size; some are operated on a part-time
 basis. Fertilizer is used, but not    
 in large amounts, because the soil is 
 already rich and fertile. The         
 increased use of machines has reduced 
 to number of people employed on farms.
