		<content> Many people would agree that Birchwood
 has been designed with some           
 consideration given to{leisure time.  
 Near the shopping parade is the       
{Leisure Centre}which functions as a   
 public house with pool rooms and      
 squash courts.Keep fit clubs meet     
 there.Next to the centre is a{BMX     
{track}that attracts people from a     
 large area.Nearby is a playing field. 
 The shopping centre has an amusement  
 arcade.There are{societies}such as    
 Scouts &amp; Guides similarly found in    
 Skellingthorpe.Birchwood has a{Junior 
{Jazz band}which gives displays in the 
 local area. There are 3 pubs,1 is     
 large and holds club meetings and     
 discos. Another has good garden       
 facilities for children.Every Saturday
 there is a disco at the small hall    
 next to St. Luke's church.
