      In the{villages}of{Fauldhouse}and
{Longridge }there  are  many{open areas
 and  fairly  wide  streets.Most houses
 have {gardens}many of them cultivated.
 Some  of  the  older  cottages have as
 much  as an{acre of ground}attached to
 them.                                 
      Traffic   through {Fauldhouse }is
 fairly light.  It  consists  mainly of
 private cars  and a few buses. Through
{Longridge}the  traffic  is  heavier as
 many large  lorries  use this route to
 travel  south   to   meet  the {A 74 .
 Therefore  there  is  little{pollution
 from traffic fumes.                   
      As  most  houses  use electric or
 gas  heating  nowadays  there  is very
 little air{pollution}from smoke.
