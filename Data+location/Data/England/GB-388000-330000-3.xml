A day in the life of Sarah Simpson (11)
I hear the voice of my mum. "Wake up   
its 7.30." My feet slowly move towards 
the floor. Still half asleep I get     
dressed into my uniform,a yellow skirt 
white shirt and grey sweater. My PE    
kit Maths homework and pencil case are 
just a few of the things I carry to    
school. Joanne knocks on the door, we  
walk up Pirehill Lane and into school  
down a hill called the ramp. The       
whistle is blown we hang bags up and go
to register. Soon we move to 1st lesson
,maths,discussing our homework - volume
of a certain shape. This lesson always 
seems to last for ages. At last we are 
let out and go to music. We go out to  
play and the whistle is blown. Next is 
workshop and games. I walk home at 3.45
No clubs today so I watch TV. Goodnight
and to sleep for another schoolday.    </content>
