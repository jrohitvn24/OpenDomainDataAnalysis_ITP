		<title>03CLUBS: W.I. AND RIFLE</title>
		<content>{ Women's Institute:}The W.I., founded 
 in 1897, is now the largest           
 organisation for women in England. It 
 aims to help the community by         
 assisting with fund-raising events    
 etc. and generally improving the      
 quality of life for country women. The
 monthly meetings begin with the hymn  
 'Jerusalem' and include films and     
 handicraft sessions. Broadwell W.I.   
 has 26 members and Oddington W.I. has 
 27.                                   
{Broadwell Rifle Club:}The club, formed
 40 years ago, meets in the village    
 hall. Members from a 12 mile radius   
 travel as far as Bristol to compete.  
 Four contestants, wearing padded      
 shoulder jackets, lie on mats in a    
 darkened room and using 18lb guns fire
 live bullets at illuminated targets at
 the far end of the hall. The guns are 
 kept locked away in a strong room.    </content>
