		<title>15CONSERVATION AT HARNHILL</title>
		<content> The removal of hedges in response to  
 Government encouragement to increase  
 food production in the 1940's,        
 lessened the available habitat for the
 natural fauna. Plans now exist and are
 being implemented for the             
 re-establishment of these hedges, and 
 the replacement of trees lost to the  
 ravages of Dutch Elm Disease.New ponds
 have also been created and there is   
 now a greater number of these than in 
 the past 100 years. Harnhill supports 
 a surprising number of species of     
 birds, mammals and insects considering
 it is one of the most modern and      
 progressive farms in Gloucestershire. 
 It combines efficient farming methods,
 with a broad minded commitment to     
 conservation. Habitat varies from     
 cereal, grass and some roots, to ten  
 small woodlands, hedges and a short   
 stretch of the Ampney Brook.          </content>
