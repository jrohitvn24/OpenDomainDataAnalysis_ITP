		<content> THIS WARD OF WYCOMBE DISTRICT COUNCIL 
 USED TO RETURN A LABOUR OR INDEPENDENT
 COUNCILLOR BUT HAS BECOME A "TORY"    
 STRONGHOLD AND LABOUR CANDIDATES NO   
 LONGER STAND. THERE WILL BE A{DISTRICT
{COUNCIL BY-ELECTION}HERE SOON WITH    
 CONSERVATIVE AND ALLIANCE CANDIDATES. 
 THIS IS THE FIRST CONTESTED ELECTION  
 FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND IS CREATING MUCH
 INTEREST AS BOTH ARE WELLKNOWN. IN    
 CONTRAST, THE{PARISH COUNCIL}IS ALMOST
 APOLITICAL IN ITS MAKEUP. PARISH      
 COUNCILLORS ARE ELECTED BECAUSE THEY  
 ARE WELL LIKED. MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT
 THEY DO NOT HAVE EFFECTIVE POWERS TO  
 GUARD LOCAL INTERESTS. BECAUSE THE    
 PARISH COVERS THREE SEPARATE VILLAGES,
 THERE ARE{CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
