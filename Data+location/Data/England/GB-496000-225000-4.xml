		<title>04SETTLEMENT SITE 1, HOCKLIFFE</title>
		<content>  Hockliffe's{earliest settlement}began
 high on a hill commanding a splendid  
 view of the surrounding area with a   
 water supply from the nearby{springs} 
 and maybe even{Clipstone Brook,}a     
 tributary of the{River Ouzel.}        
 By{1086}according to the{Domesday Book
 the settlement boasted a{population}of
 about{120.}During the early{Middle }  
{Ages}a church was built on the hill   
 and the houses spread around it       
 forming a{nucleated village.}Less than
 a mile away the{Roman Watling Street} 
 ran between{Chester(Deva)}and{London }
{(Londinium).}Settlement began to grow 
 up along the old Roman road towards   
 the end of the Middle Ages.  As a     
 result many of the houses around the  
 church were{deserted}and fell into    
{ruin.}Grass and weeds grew over the   
 ruins and bumps and mounds were all   
 that remained of{Medieval Hockliffe.} </content>
