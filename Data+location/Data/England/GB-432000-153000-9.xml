		<title>09Landscape of Vernham Dean CP</title>
		<content>  The landscape is some of the most    
 varied and beautiful in Hampshire.    
 The southern part of the area is      
 gently sloping land rising from the   
 south to a height of 750 feet and     
 giving extensive views over Andover   
 and beyond. The land is then traversed
 by a valley with a steep southern     
 face. The valley contains the village 
 of Upton at a height of 400 feet.     
  The northern side of the valley      
 returns to a height of about 750 feet 
 to give extensive views northwards    
 over Vernham Dean into Berkshire.     
  The area retains a reasonable amount 
 of woodland which is generally        
 deciduous, although there is one      
 plantation of conifers.               
  The varied landscape and the woodland
 provide ideal habitat for wildlife    
 including deer, badger, fox and       
 pheasant.                             </content>
