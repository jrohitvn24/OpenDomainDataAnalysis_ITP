		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF BLOCK</title>
		<content> The block comprises parts of 4 civil  
 parishes, more than half being in     
 Inwardleigh and the remainder being   
 divided between Northlew and          
 Okehampton Hamlets with a small corner
 being in Beaworthy parish. The area is
 mainly a plateau about 600 to 700 feet
 above sea level a few miles north of  
 Dartmoor. It is criss-crossed with    
 brooks which feed into the River Lew, 
 a tributory of the Torridge. The land 
 is mostly farmland used to graze      
 cattle and sheep, but there are also  
 some areas of woodland and some arable
 crops. Housing is mostly isolated farm
 houses and cottages of traditional cob
 construction although some have been  
 extensively modernised. Although there
 is some tourism in the area to augment
 income from farming the lanes are     
 generally free from heavy traffic even
 at the height of the holiday season.  </content>
