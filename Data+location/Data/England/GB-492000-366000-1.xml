		<content> The town of North Hykeham is a fast   
 growing suburban town three miles     
 from Lincoln.There are large housing  
 estates and an industrial estate.     
  In 1974 the Parish Council decided   
 to change the village into a town,and 
 this body then became a Town Council  
 and North Hykeham has a Mayor,elected 
 each year.In 1985 we have a Lady      
 Mayor,Mrs.Proctor.                    
  A new relief road is being built     
 which should relieve the A46 of the   
 heavy traffic travelling through the  
 centre of the town.                   
  North Hykeham has several playing    
 fields,the Witham Fields and the      
 Memorial Field being the largest.     
 There is a large sports centre with   
 all facilities.
