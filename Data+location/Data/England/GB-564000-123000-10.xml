		<title>10BURWASH CAR PARK</title>
		<content>    At the edge of the Car Park        
 in Burwash there is a Scout Hut, where
 the the Cubs meet too. The Public car 
 Park is adjacent to the Bear's own    
 car park.                             
    The other facilities are Toilets,  
 two Bottle Banks and three Bins. There
 are lots of lines marked on the tarmac
 to show the drivers where to park.    
    At the back of the Scout Hut there 
 is a path that will take you to       
 Bateman's, the house where Rudyard    
 Kipling once lived. Here too through  
 the trees at the back of the car park 
 cows can be seen chewing the cud and  
 at the front, is the narrow crowded   
 High Street. The Car Park is very busy
 all day long but when the shops close 
 you can park quite easily, I know     
 because Mum drops me off for scouts.  
 We lay signs for other patrols and    
 track all the way back to the car park</content>
