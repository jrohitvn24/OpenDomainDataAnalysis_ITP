		<content> On the motorway asphalt is used but on
 the country roads(main roads) asphalt 
 or "layering" course is used.The      
 tarmac used to surface the roads is   
 taken from the quarries, put on the   
 roads and then a machine spreads the  
 tarmac out and flattens it.           
{DAMAGES ON THE ROAD}-The accidents on 
 the roads often cause damages, which  
 are the responsibility of the         
 roadworks department- for example if a
 fence is broken the men have to mend  
 it. Signs are often stolen or         
 vandalised or they are moved.         
{UNUSUAL HAPPENINGS}-The roadworks     
 department find stray animals on the  
 motorway and also vehicles on the     
 wrong side of the road, both of these 
 are highly dangerous!If there ever are
 any animals on the roads the traffic  
 is stopped immediately to prevent an  
 accident from occuring.               </content>
