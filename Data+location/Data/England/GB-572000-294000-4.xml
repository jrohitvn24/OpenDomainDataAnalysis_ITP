		<content> The Fire Station                      
 The fire station was built in 1967.The
 fire men have about 90 calls a        
 year.The station is run by the Norfolk
 County Council with money from the    
 rate payers.There are eleven          
 firemen.They attend about fifteen road
 accidents a year.All fire men live    
 within one mile of Methwold. After a  
 call-out the men only have three      
 minutes to get to the station before  
 the fire engine leaves.The equipment  
 on the fire engine includes:          
 pump;hose;cutting equipment;five      
 hundred of water.The fire engine      
 attended an aircraft crash in the     
 forest near Brandon recently.Twenty   
 five tenders were needed to help.
