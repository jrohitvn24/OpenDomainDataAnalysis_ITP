		<title>08Karate Club</title>
		<content>      At our school at 7.00 p.m my dad 
 and his friend run a karate club which
 anybody can join. There are two       
 sessions. The children train for one  
 hour and the seniors for the next two.
 Karate is on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  
 You have to remember the 'Oath' which 
 is a promise not to use karate when   
 not necessary. There are different    
 belts to get and for each you have to 
 take a grading. There are seven belts 
 which are:- yellow, orange, green,    
 blue, purple, brown and black. My dad 
 is a black belt 2nd Dan and I am a    
 purple belt. To get into karate club  
 you pay 50 pence every week you come. 
 There are eight basic moves you have  
 to learn which are quite easy when you
 know them. There are eight Dans in the
 black belt. My Dad is one. Sometimes  
 we do demonstrations for people at    
 different schools.                    </content>
