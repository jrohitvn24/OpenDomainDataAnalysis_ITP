{986 }men and {578}women ,out of a     
 population  of {29000.                
   Unemployment in Exmouth is an       
 increasing problem,but a lot of people
 think that some of the unemployed     
 people would get jobs if they tried { 
 harder. There are more jobs available 
 in the{Summer}because of{tourists.   }
   The{Y.T.S.}or Youth Training Scheme

 jobs they want to do. Many people have
 got jobs through this scheme, and it  
 gives many others the opportunity to  
 gain work experience.
