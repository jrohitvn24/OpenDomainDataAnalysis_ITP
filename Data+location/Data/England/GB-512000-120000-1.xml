		<title>01The Coolham and Shipley Area</title>
		<content> This rural, mainly undeveloped area,  
 bordered on the north by the main A272
 trunk road is situated in the heart of
 the Sussex Weald. Its population is   
 centred on Coolham at the north west  
 boundary and the ancient, picturesque 
 village of Shipley in the middle of   
 the block.                            
 With views of Chanctonbury Ring on the
 South Downs, the typically Wealden    
 area of low lying, flat, fertile,     
 agricultural clay is drained by many  
 ditches flowing into the River        
 Adur and its tributaries. Ditches,    
 hawthorn hedges and Wealden oak trees 
 bound fields and roadside verges.     
 Historical associations range from the
 Romans and Normans to a World War II  
 airfield. The area contains buildings 
 linked with William Penn, Hilaire     
 Belloc and others, and reference to it
 occurs in the original Domesday Book. </content>
