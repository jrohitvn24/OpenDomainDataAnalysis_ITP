		<content> There are no schools in the block,    
 which is largely covered by the catch-
 ment area of Keevil Primary School and
 Clarendon Comprehensive, Trowbridge.  
 Parental choice enables children to   
 attend Seend school and Comps. in     
 Melksham,Market Lavington and Devizes.
 At least 11 are educated at private   
 schools at Potterne, Trowbridge and   
 Bath. Trowbridge College provides for 
 the l6+ students. 75% of the CofE con-
 trolled Keevil School's 61 pupils come
 from the block area, whilst the 3.20  
 staff live elsewhere. Owing to limited
 space, school makes regular use of the
 Village Hall and Playing Field. Noah's
 Ark was the School's PTA prizewinning 
 float at the 1985 Trowbridge Carnival;
 the result of joint work by local     
 families. Children 3-5yrs attend Play-
 groups in the area. An adult education
 class in yoga is held at Keevil Hall. </content>
