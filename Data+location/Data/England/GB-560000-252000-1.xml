		<title>01THE CAMBRIDGESHIRE UPLANDS</title>
		<content> The area consists of undulating,      
 rather featureless, arable farmland.  
 Large fields, with deep drainage      
 ditches, provide for the efficient use
 of heavy agricultural machinery. Small
 farmsteads and barns have been        
 replaced by large factory-built sheds.
 There are a few hedgerows and         
 deciduous woodlands, the latter       
 preserved as game cover and for fox   
 hunting. Recently established studs   
 and paddocks have increased grazing   
 land, and saplings are being planted  
 on road side verges. Trees abound in  
 the villages. With new housing        
 estates, village populations are      
 expanding, but few inhabitants are    
 employed locally. The majority travel 
 to work by car in neighbouring towns  
 or to London. Bus services are        
 infrequent.
