   First walk round in a circle and    
 sing "Lollipop lollipop here we go    
 again." Do that twice. Then you all   
 sit down and the last person to be    
 sitting down goes out. Then the people
 left in discuss a name of a boy then  
 the other person who was out comes in 
 and he or she stands in the middle and
 they walk round saying the name of the
 boy or girl chosen. If she dislikes   
 him she stamps her feet, if she       
 likes him she claps her hands and if  
 she loves him she rolls her hands.    
 Then she joins the circle again and it
 starts over once more.                
   This game is played by the infants  
 at Chilthorne Domer school.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
