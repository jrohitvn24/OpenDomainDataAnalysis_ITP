		<title>20MOOR PARK HOUSE</title>
		<content> Moor Park is a large house standing to
 the west of Beckwithshaw in its own   
 grounds.It was built in 1859 and many 
 villagers have been employed there in 
 differing capacities over the years.It
 was bought in the late 1970's by      
 Harrison Developments of Leeds who    
 converted some of the rooms in the    
 house and stable block into flats and 
 others into offices for themselves.   
 During 1983/5 they have stopped       
 reletting flats and have moved tenants
 from the house into the stable block. 
 This has caused concern in the village
 as to what will happen.Rumours have   
 included a country club,a restaurant  
 and a squash club with facilities for 
 meals.Nothing has yet been started and
 villagers are hoping that the house   
 will not be left to deteriorate or be 
 pulled down.
