		<title>01WARMSWORTH</title>
		<content>{Warmsworth}is a moderately peaceful   
 place to live in.  It is an urban     
 area, unlike 200 years ago when it was
 a rural village.  Warmsworth has      
 changed a great deal in the last 100  
 years.  Motorways, new houses and     
 farmland have almost taken over the   
 old{Warmsworth,}yet some houses remain
 from the 14th and 15th centuries.     
{Warmsworth}is situated on the western 
 edge of{Doncaster,}from which it is   
 difficult to distinguish. To the North
 of{Warmsworth}lies the River Don and  
 Sprotborough.  To the South is the pit
 village of{Edlington}where coal is    
 mined.  The local industries are      
{quarrying}and{mining. }Most people    
 commute from Warmsworth to nearby     
 towns and cities.  The overall        
 impression of{Warmsworth}is that it is
 a pleasant place to live.
