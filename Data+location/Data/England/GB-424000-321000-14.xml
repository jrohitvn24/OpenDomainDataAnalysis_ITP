		<title>14Bass Museum of Brewing</title>
		<content>     Bass Museum stands on the corner  
of Guild Street.   It is famous around 
the country for its history of brewing 
and models.   As you arrive in the     
museum you watch a film about the olden
days and the way beer used to be made. 
On a shelf there are ingredients -     
hops,barley and a bowl of water.       
There is one particular model shows the
old Burton where there used to be a lot
of fields and farms.   Also there is a 
model of a ship carrying beer barrels. 
     Making barrels was very important.
In the shopping precint there is a     
statue of a cooper showing this.   To  
make a barrel you need about ten pieces
of wood then to keep them together you 
need metal rings all the way round.    
Most beer today is contained in metal  
kegs, and there are very few coopers   
left in the breweries.
