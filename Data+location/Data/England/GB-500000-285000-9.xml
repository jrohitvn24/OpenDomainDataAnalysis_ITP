		<title>09OUNDLE - THE SOUTH ROAD AREA</title>
		<content> Our survey took us along South Road to
 the junction with Barnwell Road and   
 down as far as the old mill which is  
 now a restaurant called Barnwell      
 Mill.We then returned to school along 
 the old towpath by the River Nene,    
 thus making a round trip of some 2.25 
 miles. South Road is mainly           
 residential. There are however certain
 fine examples of the old industries   
 which existed in Oundle including the 
 old malthouse and one of the four     
 breweries. An old warehouse, now      
 converted into flats, was also        
 seen.The vet is housed in an old      
 school building  on South Road and    
 hold three surgeries each day from    
 Monday to Friday - 9-9.30a.m.,        
 2-2.30p.m. and 6-6.30p.m. There is    
 also a Saturday surgery at 9.00a.m.   
 Just over the Thrapston Road bridge is
 Oundle Marina.                        </content>
