		<title>05FARMING IN CHIPPING WARDEN</title>
		<content>Farming around Chipping Warden is      
mostly arable, beef, sheep and some    
dairy. Most of the family farms have   
been amalgamated into big farms because
farmers have retired or sold their     
farms. The arable consists of wheat,oil
seed rape, barley, oats and various    
grasses grown for seed or feed. Also   
potatoes and, growing more popular,    
peas and beans, grown for animal feed. 
Most  of the leys are temporary (one   
year) with the exception of Mr Goffe   
and Gibbons which are permanent leys or
pasture(over 2 years) Most of the farms
employ local staff. With the various   
farms there are still quite a lot of   
"tied cottages," houses which belong to
the farms.
