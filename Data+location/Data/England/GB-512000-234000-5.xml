		<content> There is no class or social structure 
 here; it just would not be tolerated. 
 This is a grass roots village of      
 people working in harmony for the goog
 of all.                               
 Although rural, Shillington could not 
 really be described as a farming      
 community. Most people commut to the  
 surrounding towns to work, especially 
 Luton, Dunstable, Hitchin and also    
 London. The Luton car industry once   
 dominated most of the employment in   
 the area. Summer holidays were        
 described as "Vauxhall fortnight."    
 Now, it is not so prominent but still 
 important.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
