		<title>20LOCAL FOOTBALL CLUBS</title>
		<content>   We have several football clubs for  
 boys in our area.Two of them are Yate 
 United. and .St.Nicholas.In our school
 football is extremely popular.About   
 three quarters of the boys like to    
 play football.About half of those play
 for a team.Many boys also play for    
 school teams.I find the games I play  
 in are sporting.In my team the players
 never blame one another.              
                                       
 There have been several football      
 disasters recently.One was            
 the  Bradford fire.Perhaps the most   
 disasterous one was the  Brussels     
 tragedy where Liverpool supporters    
 broke into the  Juventus area and 56  
 people died in the crush and 209 were 
 injured.Despite these problems in     
 professional football schoolboys      
 still love playing football.
