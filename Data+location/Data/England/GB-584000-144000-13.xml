		<content> There is an extremely large number of 
{Ponds}scattered all over this country 
 side East of{Headcorn village,}which  
 is situated in the{LOW WEALD}of{KENT.}
 Some of the ponds are inaccessable and
 completely hidden by undergrowth, only
 being visible from the air.  Others   
 are found in little groups, huddled   
 together and surrounded by trees such 
 as{Willow}and{Ash,}or in a coppice of 
{Hazel}and{Chestnut.}There is hardly a 
 farmhouse without it's pond, usually  
 harbouring families of Ducks. They are
 Fresh water ponds and many contain    
 Fish; these are frequented by Anglers 
 of all ages, but it usual first to    
 obtain a permit. Little{streams}like  
 the{river Sherway}also trickle through
 the area from the many Springs rising 
 out of the Greensand Ridge to the     
 North                                 
                                       </content>
