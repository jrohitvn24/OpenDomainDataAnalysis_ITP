		<title>09GREAT BARDFIELD WINDMILL</title>
		<content>  The windmill in Great Bardfield is   
 3OO years old. It is a brick built    
 tower with a boat shaped cap and      
 common sails. The windmill was        
 originally worked in conjunction with 
 the watermill. When the water level   
 dropped at the mill the windmill would
 be used instead for grinding the      
 wheat, which was used for cattle feed.
 The present wall around the windmill  
 is made from the original workings and
 cogs of the mill. The steps leading to
 the mill are made from the grinding   
 stones. The workings for the sails are
 still in the cap even though the mill 
 has been converted into a residential 
 dwelling.
