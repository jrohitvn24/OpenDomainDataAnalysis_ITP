		<title>09MOTOR CROSS ON THE DOWNS</title>
		<content>{Motor Cross}is a sport for motor cycle
 enthusiasts. It is a modern sport, and
 the cycles are specially adapted for  
 rough riding. The course is set on a  
 steep slope, unsuitable for           
 cultivation near the Bridleway{M.R.   
{253087.}The farmer and the local      
 Authority have given permission.      
 Racing takes place mostly at the      
 weekend and the riders race around a  
 continuous circuit on the steep       
 hillside. Some people complain about  
 the noise and dust, others complain   
 about the ugly scar on the Downs which
 is visible for miles. The enthusiasts,
 who come from all over S.E. England,  
 enjoy the speed and thrills of the    
 racing and most people feel that it   
 keeps them off the roads, which would 
 be more dangerous. So{Motor Cross}is  
 allowed to continue at the moment.
