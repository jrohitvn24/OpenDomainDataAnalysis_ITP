In the West of our Domesday square most
of it is taken up by marshes.At the    
moment farms have drained the land and 
cattle are grazing.We went to Ivy farm 
where we saw owls,brown and white.We   
had to be very quiet.We also went to   
Sprats Water Nature Reserve.Here are   
lots of birds.There are a lot of       
Holiday makers who come to Oulton      
Broad every year and go up the Broads  
on boats.Near the      Waveney Inn is a
marina.Here is where   most of the     
boats stop.There are also a couple of  
other farms .One of the other  farms   
is called Beech Farm.There are also    
quite a few more.There is a mill       
called the Share Mill.This mill does   
not work any more.
