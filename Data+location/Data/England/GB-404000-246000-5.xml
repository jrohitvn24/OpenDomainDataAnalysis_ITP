		<title>05Fishing on the Avon.</title>
		<content> I go fishing on the River Avon with   
 my dad. Sometimes my sister comes     
 too.My daddy occasionally enters      
 fishing competitions on the River     
 Avon and sometimes on the lake. I have
 my own fishing rod and reel. I also   
 have some small weights and floats.   
 When I go river fishing I take maggots
 always and sometimes worms.I have     
 caught lots of 'daddy ruffe',but we   
 only keep the bigger ones. When we    
 have finished fishing we put them back
 in the water.I have caught minnows and
 a little trout. My dad has caught     
 chubb, an eel,a barbel,and lots more  
 freshwater fish.                      
 We often go fishing after             
 breakfast and take our sandwiches with
 us and stay until tea time. I learnt  
 to fish when I was five . I enjoy     
 fishing very much because it is very  
 quiet and peaceful.                   </content>
