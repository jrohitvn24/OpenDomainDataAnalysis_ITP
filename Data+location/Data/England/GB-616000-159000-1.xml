		<content>The area around Sturry and Broad Oak   
is mainly mixed residential with       
farming and some light industury. The  
villages have grown and Sturry is a    
small dormitory town for Canterbury.   
The A28 to the coast bisects the lower 
village and carries a constant stream  
of heavy traffic-halted every half hour
by hand operated railway crossing gates
Pedestrians grumble and motorists fume.
Beyond the busy village and main roads 
there are large lakes left by quarrying
along the River Stour noted nationally 
as bird and wild life reserve.Eastwards
light industries are grouped on an     
industrial estate designated for the   
purpose to the west of Canterbury.     
Beyond the villages the A28 is called  
the Island road and crosses rich       
drained mixed arable farmland as it    
carries tourists and foreign visitors  
into the Isle of Thanet and the coast. </content>
