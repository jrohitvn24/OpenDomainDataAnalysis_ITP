		<content> The area included in the survey covers
 the east part of Manchester (Higher   
 Openshaw,Gorton and Denton) and the   
 south side of Tameside (Droylsden).   
 The land is gently undulating and     
 largely urban with both residential   
 and industrial landuse. Some of the   
 old industries remain but many of the 
 heavy engineering (locomotives) and   
 iron and steel works have gone.       
 Manchester Steel remains at Openshaw  
 but is due to close in 1986. A pool of
 skilled and semi-skilled labour       
 remains in the area. The region is    
 criss-crossed by different transport  
 networks, old and new, reminders of an
 early, thriving industrial growth, and
 more recent urban renewal and         
 landscaping. Subsumed within the      
 conurbation, the old centres have     
 retained their sense of identity and  
 community.                            </content>
