		<title>15INTERVIEW AT LANGDON BARTON</title>
		<content>{Mr Andrews}the present owner of Langd-
 on Barton Farm can remember his mother
 talking about{life at Langdon since   
{1903}when the farm was part of the    
 Cory Family Estate.{She saw the change
{from horse-power to tractors.}The hor-
 ses were last worked in 1950. Then    
 there were 20 - 12 shires and 8 colts.
{The first tractor was American, called
{an "Overtime",bought during WW1.}In   
 1927 the Cory Estates were sold, and  
 John Andrews bought the buildings and 
 200 acres for Â£5650.{In 1935 7 local  
{men were employed here. A cow then    
{cost Â£20.}Cattle and sheep were kept, 
 and swedes and potatoes grown.{In 1936
{electricity came, mains water not unt-
{il 1948.}Before this the pump in the  
 yard was used.{This often ran dry,and 
{the well at Raneleigh Farm was borrow-
{ed.}Before WW1{poverty}was great, and 
 the Andrews took local{apprentices.   </content>
