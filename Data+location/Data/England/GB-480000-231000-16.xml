		<content>                                       
In the field near Church Hill there is 
a mound.  Mrs Weatherby told us about  
it and gave us permission to go and see
it as it is on their property.  It is  
just a mound in the middle of the field
with some very ancient yew trees       
growing on it.  It has been classified 
as an ancient monument so no one can   
destroy it.  The rumours in the village
are that Roman soldiers are buried in  
the mound but Mrs Weatherby told us    
that an archaelogist worked on the     
mound about twenty years ago but found 
nothing.  Twelve of us went to see the 
mound and most of us did not know about
this ancient monument in the village   
untill we visited it.  Superstitous    
people in the village believe that if  
you dig into the mound you will have   
bad luck.
