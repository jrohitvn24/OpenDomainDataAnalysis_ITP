 In the northern segment, one of the   
 main natural features is Stainsby     
 Beck,which flows north before joining 
 Blue Bell Beck at the end of West     
 Plantation Wood.                      
   West of the beck is farmland        
 belonging to Stainsby Hall Farm.Two   
 crops currently in evidence are barley
 and wheat. Land to the east leading to
 the beck is designated green belt.    
 This is land which by law is only for 
 leisure activities. It is extensively 
 used by children and adults of the    
 area. Children use it for games and   
 adults for walking and exercising     
 their dogs.                           
   Alongside the beck are the following
 trees:elder, hawthorne, willow, rose  
 and alder.Growing wild include:nettles
 sourdock,blackberry,thistles,clovers  
 and buttercups.                       </content>
