		<content>School provision in Lambeth has        
recently been reorganised at Secondary 
level. Schools have by and large become
bigger. The population trend is        
outwards from the North of the Borough 
and a reorganisation of Electoral      
Boundaries also reflects this fact. In 
addition to Aided and Voluntary        
Schools, some denominational ones still
exist.                                 
Local centres of entertainment include 
a dance hall, cinemas and several      
parks, including Brocwell Park which   
doubles as an athletic track. Much of  
the entertainment is also provided by  
clubs and private houses, where Blues  
are a regular feature of night-life.   
The area has two main roads - the A3   
and A23 to Brighton - which run through
the section. They are very busy roads!
