		<content> All Saints' Church in Ratcliffe       
 Culey, seven hundred years old, has   
 just lost its two bells.              
                                       
 They had not been rung for the last 25
 years, and during that time the wooden
 mountings have deteriorated so badly  
 that the bells have had to be brought 
 down. This was done as part of        
 restoration work on the church by     
 the local council's "community        
 programme", which is supported by the 
 government.                           
                                       
 There is some interesting mediaeval   
 stained-glass in the chancel windows, 
 including the picture of an owl.      
                                       
 Usually quiet, once every two years   
 the church is filled by the children  
 of Witherley Primary School and their 
 parents for their Carol Service.      </content>
