		<title>16LOCAL ISSUES</title>
		<content>  Here is an up to date summary of the 
 local issues of most concern on Friday
 the 20th September 1985, as           
 highlighted  by the{Falmouth Packet.} 
   Of major concern is the proposed    
 re-development of Falmouth docks area.
 One plan envisages a 600 space car    
 park, overlooked by a new supermarket.
 In a similar vein, objections are     
 being raised to the proposed building 
 of a big block of flats on the        
 seafront, which local residents say   
 would block out their view of Falmouth
 Bay.However, both developers and      
 objectors are agreed on one thing-    
 it's one of the finest panoramas      
 around.                               
   On the letters page a major talking 
 point is whether centralised          
 government should legalise mass       
 medication by flouridating the water  
 supply.                               </content>
