		<title>06NETHERHALL MANSION</title>
		<content> Maryport was known to the romans.but  
 there were few people here until      
 1066,when the Eaglesfield family took 
 the land over.they built their house  
 south of the River Ellen and the pele 
 tower on the north-side.In 1528 the   
 Senhouses took over and began to build
 on to the Pele tower. by 1738 Humphrey
 Senhouse developed the harbour and    
 prosperity came to Maryport (named    
 after his wife).coal and iron were    
 shipped out;ships were built and      
 Maryport became rich.The mansion was  
 extended 4 times.we found many stone  
 inscriptions bearing the initials     
 E.P.S. (Elizabeth Pocklington         
 Senhouse) 1883.                       
 but with the decline of coal iron     
 shipbuilding,the fortunes of Maryport 
 and the Senhouses declined also.by    
 1970 the mansion was derelict.we found
 only the pele tower left and hallway. </content>
