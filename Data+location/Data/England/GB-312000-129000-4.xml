 Mr Day took the school party up a     
 slight incline, past some farm        
 buildings and into a field. There were
 several horses in a paddock and some  
 beautiful Jersey cattle grazing       
 peacefully in an adjacent field. Mr   
 Day is very proud of his cattle. They 
 are quite famous in this part of      
 Somerset. Around the neck of each cow 
 was an electronic "bleeper" which     
 worked out exactly how much feed each 
 cow was permitted to have. The        
 children found this idea most amusing.
