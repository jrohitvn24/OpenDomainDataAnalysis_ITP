		<title>04FUNTLEY VILLAGE,N.FAREHAM</title>
		<content> Funtley village,population 500,lies to
 the N.W. of Fareham.It is a rural     
 community with a combined corner      
 shop and post office,a pub and a      
 working men's club.The village school 
 was closed in 1984 and now lies empty.
 Most of the houses in the village date
 from the 19th century but recently a  
 large housing estate has been built on
 what was derelict land surrounding the
 old brick works.Although the village  
 lacks amenities it is close enough to 
 Fareham for this to be of no concern  
 to villagers.The village is linear in 
 shape and is surrounded by fields of  
 grass and barley,to the north and is  
 bounded by the M27 to the south.
