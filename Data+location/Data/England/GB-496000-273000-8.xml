Our class  of 6 to 8 year old children 
found out what its members did during a
June week-end.Although a wide range of 
activities,food and mealtimes were     
recorded,the following seems to be a   
typical week-end for the children in   
the class.                             
On Saturday they generally got up at   
8.00 a.m.and had a cereal breakfast.The
morning was spent playing outside or   
shopping and at 12.00 to 1.00 o,clock  
they had a sandwich lunch.In the       
afternoon they played or visited a     
local fete and then sat down for an    
evening meal of sausages or salad at   
5.00p.m.                               
After watching the television they went
to bed between 8.00 and 9.00p.m.
