		<content>   We carried out a census of all the  
 parents of{Horrabridge Junior School  
 children and found that their jobs    
 fell into several categories{.Office  
{work &amp; social services}were common    
 activities,others like{mining}or      
{industrial work}were not so common.We 
 also found that men did a wider       
 variety of jobs than women ,who worked
 in 3 main areas,in services,as        
{housewives &amp; as office workers}.The   
 men were found to work in the         
 additional areas of{mining}and the    
{Armed Forces}.Very few people in this 
 area were found to be{unemployed.}This
 accounts for the Junior children's    
 parents only,we estimate approximately
 50% of the adults in the village , a  
 wider study would no doubt highlight  
 the large number of{retired}people    
 living in the area.
