   A Wednesday morning in my house is  
chaos, especially this week because we 
are looking after a dog                
called,"Bobby". He loves humans but    
hates other dogs. I lay in bed         
thinking about getting up. My room is  
dim where the red curtains reduce the  
light. Bobby comes in and stcks his    
wet nose in my ear,which finally gets  
me up.I get up ,get dressed and have   
my breakfast.While I eat I watch       
Breakfast Television. At 8.30am I      
leave for school.I might meet a friend 
on the way, if not in the playgound    
.School starts.Register, assembly,then 
,a story-this one in  fact.Playtime is 
only fifteen minutes long,but when     
you're out there it seems longer.Then  
before you know it it's lunchtime.In   
the afternoon we practise our play.    </content>
