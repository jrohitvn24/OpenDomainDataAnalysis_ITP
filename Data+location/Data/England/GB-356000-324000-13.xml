 The West Midlands Shooting Ground is  
 situated on the northern boundary of  
 the area and is a thriving club, the  
 ground being in almost constant use   
 throughout the year.  It is a         
 recognized Championship course with   
 competitors arriving from all parts of
 the country.  There are about four    
 major championships a year at present 
 and the ground is hired out for       
 private functions.  There is the      
 building of a new pavilion under      
 construction and this will provide    
 more employment in the preparation of 
 food and drinks for entertainment     
 purposes.  The Stanton Walkers are a  
 fairly newly formed club and by       
 linking the footpaths and bridle path 
 have formed a walk called The         
 Shropshire Way.  The club is very     
 active with a small nucleus of members</content>
