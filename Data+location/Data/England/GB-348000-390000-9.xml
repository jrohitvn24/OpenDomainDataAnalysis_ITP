		<content> "Going out to play" continues to be an
 alternative for children between 9-13 
 to TV, video or computers. Where the  
 choice of a leader or a target is     
 involved, rhymes play an important    
 part. Players form a circle and one   
 speaks the rhyme, touching each       
 participant's fist or shoulder in     
 turn. The end of the rhyme marks the  
 per5son selected. Here are two such   
 rhymes in current use.                
 Mickey Mouse is dead.                 
 He died last night in bed.            
 He cut his throat on a ten pound note,
 And this is what he said:             
 Red  White and Blue,                  
 The Queen hasd got the 'flu.          
 The King has got the chicken-pox,     
 And out goes you.                     
 The "YOU" retires from the circle aand
 the rhyme repeated until only one     
 remains.                              </content>
