		<title>02Views around Hemyock.</title>
		<content> The Landscape around Hemyock is       
 mainly a patchwork of fields and steep
  hills. There are approximately twenty
 two farms in our area. The hills are  
 called the Blackdowns. From most parts
 of our area you can see Culmstock     
 Beacon which is the end point of the  
 Blackdowns. In the valley there is a  
 river called the River Culm which     
 rises at Culm Head. North of the      
 village is Pencross Hill from which   
 you can see the whole of the village. 
 South of the village is Castle Hill.  
 By the church runs a stream called    
 St.Margaret's stream. It was once a   
 moat for Hemyock Castle, but there is 
 not much left of Castle or moat now.  
 The stream used to be used for a      
 waterwheel at Oxenpark farm where its 
 shed is still standing. From Oxenpark 
 the stream flows to Windsor farm.
