  Most people work in Kettering or on  
nearby farms. They travel by car. When 
people do not shop in the village shop 
they travel into Kettering. They have  
to go by car as there is only one bus  
each week and that is at 11.30 on      
Friday. It comes back in the early     
afternoon.                             
  There is no pub in the village. The  
nearest are at Slipton and Geddington, 
about 4 to 5 km away. Sometimes there  
are special events like dances and     
whist drives. There is a dance each    
Halloween. On Fridays some of the      
ladies go to the Womens Institute in   
the village. Some of the men do        
gardening or do some shooting. There is
also a Young Farmers Club. Most people 
are happy living in Grafton Underwood  
and feel that it is a nice place to    
live.                                  </content>
