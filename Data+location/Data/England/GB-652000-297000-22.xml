<title>22The Village Hall</title>
<content>

Corton Village hall was built on a footpath next to the school by Jeremiah Colman of Colman's Mustard. He was a teetotaller and wanted to deter the local workmen living in Corton from drinking after work.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Village Hall was deliberately situated between the fields and their homes and offered teas and other non-alcoholic drinks to thirsty workmen in order to prevent them from going to the pub to spend their hard-earned money on the evil "drink!"&lt;br />
