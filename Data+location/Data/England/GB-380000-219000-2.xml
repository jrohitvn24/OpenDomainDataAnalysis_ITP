		<content>     There are floods in Sandhurst     
 nearly every year.In 1947 there was a 
 great flood and this covered a wide   
 area.Cattle at Abloads Court were     
 trapped by floods and the farmer had  
 to move 49 of his cattle quickly.the  
 herd of cattle were encouraged to find
 their own route but they were         
 frightened,so the bull was let out and
 with a man in a boat leading          
 it,and the cattle followed.They made  
 their way to the Base Lane where they 
 were looked after until flood         
 went down.Farmers,with their          
 tractors used to meet local people who
 worked in Gloucester,so that they     
 could get through the floods.An       
 elderly occupant of Base Lane cottage 
 had to be brought out sitting in an   
 arm chair.The water came up above     
 the windows.
