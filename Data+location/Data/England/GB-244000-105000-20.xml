		<title>20AN EIGHT YEAR OLD'S DAY</title>
		<content> I get up in the morning at 8 am. My   
 mum is usually in bed so I go and wake
 her up. I get washed and dressed while
 mum makes breakfast. Then I feed my   
 rabbit, guinea pig, chickens, dog and 
 cat. By the time I have fed the       
 animals my breakfast is ready. I      
 usually have weetabix and a cup of    
 coffee. After breakfast I get ready   
 for school at 9.00. At school I read, 
 do maths and lots of other lessons. We
 have school dinner at 12.00 and finish
 school at 3.30. When I get home I go  
 riding on my pony Tibs.When I get back
 from riding I have my tea. After tea I
 watch television. I go to bed at 8.00.
 First I learn my spellings then my dad
 reads to me. At last I go to sleep.
