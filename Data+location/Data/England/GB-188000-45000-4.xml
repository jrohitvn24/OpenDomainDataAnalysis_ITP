		<content>{The Churches in Probus}               
 The medieval church of Probus,with the
 tallest tower in Cornwall,is in the   
 centre of the village.In a nearby     
 street is the small Methodist         
 chapel,methodism arriving here about  
 1781.The churches have some joint     
 services annually &amp; produce a joint   
 monthly magazine.On Sundays the       
 average Methodist congregation is     
 about 20.With declining numbers their 
 previous large chapel was sold to a   
 firm of antique dealers.In the        
 Anglican church an average            
 congregation is about 60,over double  
 ten years ago.The vicar is one of two 
 in a team ministry for 6 churches.This
 new team organisation is not liked by 
 older people as there is less time for
 individuals,but it saves money on     
 salaries,heating &amp; other resourses.
