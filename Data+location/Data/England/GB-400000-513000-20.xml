		<content>  There are no public swimming baths or
 leisure centres within 15 miles of the
 area.                                 
  Gardening is a very popular activity,
 especially the growing of vegetables  
 and fruit.Public recreation is centred
 upon The George &amp; Dragon public house 
 in Boldron where darts,dominoes,quoits
 and whist can be played.Residents are 
 able to attend the Startforth Morritt 
 Community Association which organises 
 many events in the school.The village 
 hall is used to a lesser degree.      
  Family pastimes such as T.V. viewing,
 walking,board games,computer games and
 reading are much the same as in every 
 other part of the country.
