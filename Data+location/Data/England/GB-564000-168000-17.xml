		<title>17Cobham Fete</title>
		<content> There is a fete held on the recreation
 ground every year on August bank      
 holiday Monday.There is always a sign 
 put on the school fence to let people 
 know what day and what time.All the   
 village help to get things ready,and  
 Mr.Jackson the farmer,comes around    
 with his truck to collect things which
 people give away,also the bundles of  
 straw which are needed for the games. 
 There are lots of things to do and    
 lots of things to buy,also raffles to 
 be won.It is normally a hot day and   
 the field is packed with people from  
 the nearby towns.There are coco-nut   
 shies and many game stalls.
