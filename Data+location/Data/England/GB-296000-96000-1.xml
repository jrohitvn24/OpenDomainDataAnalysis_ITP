		<title>01** BROADCLYST  VILLAGE **</title>
		<content> Broadclyst is a small village 6 miles 
 from Exeter.It has a lot of facilities
 including church,park,2 shops and 2   
 schools.                              
 We aren't by the sea but there are    
 some beaches nearby.We are lucky in   
 having only 2 main roads.One runs     
 through the village,and the other runs
 round by the secondary school.        
 The land around is used for crops and 
 animals.There are more crops than     
 animals.                              
 Broadclyst is beautiful,but spoilt by 
 the water tower,though there are trees
 growing around it.                    
 The river Clyst is nice,but ruined in 
 places where people have put their    
 rubbish such as crisp packets,yoghurt 
 cartons and biscuit wrappings.        
 The type of housing in Broadclyst is  
 red brick,white stone,pebble dash and 
 cob cottages.                         </content>
