  A feature at Beamish is the Drift    
 mine which has been developed at the  
 site of an original colliery.At the   
 colliery there is a steam winder,a    
 street of pit cottages complete with  
 burning coal fires and the drift mine 
 itself which has given visitors the   
 opportunity to enter and see the      
 workings for themselves.              
  Visitors are taken into the 'drift'  
 in coal trucks and ,wearing their pit 
 helmets,allowed to come face to face  
 with the coal face!                   
  The most frequent visitors to the    
 drift mine are ex and working         
 miners!
