		<content> The blocks rural aspect isbeing eroded
 by sprawling Kidlington. (pop 14500)  
 The early stone built village near the
 church (slide 2) is now an appendage  
 to the development along the ribbon of
 the busy A423T. Approx 4,500 houses   
 exist,mainly brick,and are still      
 being built. They house workers,      
 mainly at Austin Rover. Most are owner
 occupied,the crime rate is low. Though
 communal activities include           
 sport/recreational/educationl/entertai
 nment- geographical and social focus  
 is lacking. Thames Valley Police      
 Authority is housed here.             
 River Cherwell flows NW - SE dividding
 the block. On its flood plain         
 (Hampton Poyle) pop 115 is less       
 developed,housing 19 traditional stone
 ouses and 18 brick/rendered .Farm     
 workers live in tied cottages,most    
 dwellrs are school/university teachers</content>
