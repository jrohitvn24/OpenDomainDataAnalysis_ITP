 When it is {Diwali}we go to a kind of 
 school and when we get there we have  
 to take our shoes off and we go in a  
 hall.In the hall there is a small     
 temple with a god's picture in it. We 
 go there at night.First we do a dance 
 around the temple then we do an{Arti  
 that means we hold a stainless steel  
 plate and on the plate there is some  
 coloured rice and a Diva and some     
{Kanku}which is a holy red powder and  
 we do a prayer song.Then people give  
 out Indian sweets then we do a stick  
 dance around the small temple.The     
 temple is decorated with flowers and  
 Divas and rose necklaces then people  
 go home.This is our{Festival.}This    
 lasts for nine days.{Diwali}is usually
 in October or early November and it is
 a {god's festival.}
