		<content> Old farms have been amalgamated to    
 make a large farm estate, owned by    
 City firms as investments and farmed  
 by an agricultural expert living      
 locally. Other farmhouses are either  
 used by farmworkers or sold off. Many 
 field hedges and coppices have been   
 grubbed out to make fields of 15-30   
 ha.,with the loss of much wildlife    
 habitat. Phasel's Wood is owned by the
 Scout Movement and used as a permanent
 campsite for all their members, and   
 this is constantly in use at weekends 
 and in school holidays. Smaller fields
 within the 'Green belt' have been sold
 for grazing to owners of the many     
 horses regularly ridden in this       
 area.This has given rise to the term  
 'horsiculture' which uses agricultural
 land and palatial stables and jumps   
 are built on it,but no houses are     
 allowed.                              </content>
