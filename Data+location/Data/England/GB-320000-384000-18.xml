		<title>18LOCAL ISSUES JULY 1985</title>
		<content>    There are two local free newspapers
 which are delivered to nearly every   
 home in the area.They are the Wirral  
 Globe and the Hoylake and West Kirby  
 edition of The Wirral News.           
   The summary of local issues covers  
 the week ending July 12th 1985.       
   There were rumours this week that   
 untreated sewage was to be pumped into
 the sea off North Wirral and as this  
 would have affected our area there    
 were strong protests.These rumours    
 were denied by the North West Water   
 Authority.                            
   There have been fears expressed by  
 members of the locality about the     
 increasing numbers of burglaries in   
 the district.                         
    There is general concern amongst   
 many people about the poor condition  
 of some of the roads and pavements in 
 the area.                             </content>
