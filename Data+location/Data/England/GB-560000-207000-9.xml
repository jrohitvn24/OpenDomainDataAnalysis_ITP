		<title>09COOLEY SPRINGS WOOD,ROXWELL</title>
		<content>       Cooley Spring is a little clump 
 of trees in the middle of two fields. 
 There is a foot path up to it. One of 
 the things that puzzled us was why had
 the farmer left only these trees in   
 the middle of two fields. We came to  
 the conclusion that it was problably  
 too boggy. When we went in our        
 conclusion seemed right. Inside it was
 peaceful, quiet and lived up to its   
 name because a cool breeze blew all   
 the time. Only a few birds sang while 
 we were walking through. The word     
 spring is used as there is a fresh    
 spring somewhere in the small wood.   
 Another reason why it is so muddy is  
 the rain comes down and lays on the   
 ground and the sun can't evaporate    
 it. One of the trees in Cooley Spring 
 had a branch that had started growing 
 round the trunk. It has stopped       
 growing half way up.                  </content>
