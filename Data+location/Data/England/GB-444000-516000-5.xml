		<title>05LOCAL HISTORY:The Five Lamps</title>
		<content> The{Five Lamps}which stood at the     
 junction of{Westbury St.}and{Mandale  
{Rd.}was the best known feature of{    
{Thornaby.}It was erected in 1874 by   
 private subscription.It was an ornate 
 lamp standard with five lamps mounted 
 on a paved platform. Until the new    
 town centre was built on the          
 airfield,Mandale Rd. was the main     
 shopping centre of Thornaby. Benches  
 were placed around the platform and   
 they provided a meeting place for the 
 people of the town.During elections   
 candidates addressed meetings at the  
 Five Lamps and public parades         
 assembled there.When the new road     
 system was built ten years ago the    
 Five Lamps}were removed.In 1983 a     
 replica was made by apprentices at{   
{Head Wrightson's}and it was sited in{ 
{Westbury St.}about 100m.from its      
 original position.                    </content>
