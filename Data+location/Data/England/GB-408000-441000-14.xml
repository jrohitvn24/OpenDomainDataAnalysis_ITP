 CRICKET PITCHES                       
                                       
 We have four cricket pitches in the   
 bottom half of Riddlesden.The cricket 
 pitches are owned by the council.They 
 have selected caretakers.The          
 caretakers have the key to the hut and
 the changing rooms,they clean up hut  
 and changing rooms after the games.The
 caretakers wives wash the clothes e.g.
 white trousers,white shirts,and socks.
 The caretakers also look after the    
 pitch and see that no harm is done    
 that might ruin the grass on the      
 pitch.The cricketers provide their own
 pads,cricket bats,wickets,and balls.
