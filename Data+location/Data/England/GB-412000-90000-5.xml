 MOST IMPORTANT BUILDINGS IN           
 CHRISTCHUCH AND THE TOWN IS ACTUALLY  
 NAMED AFTER IT. YOU CAN SEE THE CHURCH
 AS YOU ENTER THE TOWN, PARTICULARLY   
 FROM THE EAST, AND MANY TOURISTS VISIT
 IT EACH YEAR BECAUSE OF ITS MANY      
 INTERESTING FEATURES. THERE ARE       
 SERVICES EVERY DAY AND THREE ON       
 SUNDAYS AT WHICH THE CHOIR SINGS. THE 
 PRIORY IS A VERY POPULAR VENUE FOR    
 WEDDINGS. THE PRIORY CHURCH OF ENGLAND
 PRIMARY SCHOOL HOLDS ITS BEGINNING AND
 END OF TERM SERVICE, HARVEST FESTIVAL 
 AND CAROL SERVICE THERE AND THE VICAR 
 VISITS THE SCHOOL EACH WEEK TO TAKE   
 ASSEMBLY. SOME OF THE CHILDREN AND    
 THEIR FAMILIES ATTEND THE MONTHLY     
 FAMILY EUCHARIST SERVICES AT THE      
 PRIORY, OTHERS GO TO THE DAUGHTER     
 CHURCHES OR OTHER DENOMINATIONS AND   
 SOME DO NOT GO TO CHURCH AT ALL.      </content>
