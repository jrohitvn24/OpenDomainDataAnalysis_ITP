		<content>   The first inhabitants in Eastnor    
  area were ancient Druid dwellers     
  who lived on Midsummer Hill and      
  worshipped the sun.                  
   The village itself has always been  
  owned and built by members of the    
  Somers_Cocks family.                 
   The present post office was once a  
  black smith and about the middle of  
  the 19th century it was moved to its 
  present position near the church.At  
  the same time the road was rebuilt   
  because it once went past the church 
  on the way to Ledbury.               
   In the Middle ages the Malvern Hills
  were a chase.The Bishop of Hereford  
  had deer on the west and The Earl of 
  Warwick had deer on the east side of 
  the hills.The Bishop of Hereford     
  complained that the Earl stole his   
  deer and vice_versa!
