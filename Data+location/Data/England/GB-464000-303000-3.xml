		<content> The valley itself  is rolling farmland
 typical of the high parts of east     
 Leicestershire. It is a mixture of    
 arable land and intensively managed   
 grassland.There are few trees except a
 few copses and spinneys but the hedges
 which separate the fields do include  
 large trees.Unfortunately Dutch Elm   
 disease has destroyed over 70% of     
 trees in the area.The hedges which are
 laid back in traditional              
 Leicestershire manner form an         
 impenetrable barrier for animals and  
 humans alike, being formed of mainly  
 of hawthorn.Other trees in the hedges 
 are oak, ash, elder and rowan.The     
 dismantled railway has in the last    
 twenty years become overgrown and     
 trees and shrubs have established     
 themselves along it.The wooded areas  
 and hedges provide a good envionment  
 for wildlife.                         </content>
