		<title>17SCHOOL LIFE IN A TOWN</title>
		<content> I have just moved to Adderley from    
 Ashford Middlesex .I went to a large  
 school.Every morning when the bell    
 went we lined up outside the school.We
 went into the building, and through   
 the cloakroom to hang up our coats.   
 Our desks were very old and tatty.If  
 it was Wednesday, Thursday or Friday  
 we would have gone to Assembly. If it 
 was Monday morning we would do        
 Comprehension, and if we didn't do it 
 before play we would have to stay     
 in.After play we did Maths.For dinner 
 we would line up outside. There were  
 four dinner ladies one was also the   
 school nurse.In the afternoon         
 sometimes we would have French then   
 Physical Education.After last play we 
 finished off any work.We went home at 
 half past three.
