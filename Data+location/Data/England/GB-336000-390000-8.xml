		<content>   Newsham is derived from land once   
 known as Neusam, Newsam or Newshum    
 which comes from the Anglo_Saxon word 
 Nuvehusum_"the new houses". Early     
 records show that this area although  
 in the township of Walton also        
 extended well into the region which   
 became known as the township of West  
 Derby.                                
   Newsham House, now known as "The    
 Judges House", was built near the end 
 of the 18th century by Thomas Molyneux
 (no relation to the Earls of Sefton)  
 and was bought by Liverpool           
 Corporation in 1846. It has been a    
 guest house for VIP's such as Queen   
 Victoria (1886), Princess Beatrice    
 (1886), The Duke of Connaught (1892)  
 and the Duke and Duchess of York      
 (later George Vth AND Queen Mary) in  
 1893.
