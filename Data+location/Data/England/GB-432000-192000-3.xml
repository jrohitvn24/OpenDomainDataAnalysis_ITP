		<content>St. Denys has an 80ft. tower, an 8 bell
peal and an ordinance triangulation    
mark. It is under the patronage of     
Westminster Abbey and there are two    
services each Sunday.Within can be     
seen a piscina and reliquary, reputed  
to have held the finger of St Denys. A 
brass figure of Roger Campdene (former 
rector) dated 1398 has an even older   
brass beneath it. The wooden, carved   
pulpit and font (with its lead weight  
balance to lift the hood) are Jacobean.
The south porch, built to commemorate  
the wedding of Ann Neville to Richard  
III, has stone sheilds each side of the
doorway. The church windows are mainly 
19th  century glass. An unusual gypsy  
grave with a stone carving of a frying 
pan is in the churchyard. Rev. C.      
Wordsworth, nephew of poet William     
Wordsworth, was vicar here in 1851. He 
wrote many hymns.                      </content>
