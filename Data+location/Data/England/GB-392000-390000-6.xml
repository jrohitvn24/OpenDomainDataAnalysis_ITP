		<content> It's Two minutes past nine,we are     
 standing outside Birches again. They  
 have taken in all their display of    
 fruit and vegetables, because they are
 closed for the weekend.               
 The street lamps are on they are      
 bright orange. There are only four    
 people passing.There are no buses and 
 only a few cars. It is now very dark, 
 only the shop windows and the street  
 lamps light the scene.                
 We have only heard the Pelican        
 crossing being used three times,a     
 great contrast to this morning. The   
 logo on Romiley Forum stands out most.
 It's much colder than this morning now
 but it has stopped raining.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
