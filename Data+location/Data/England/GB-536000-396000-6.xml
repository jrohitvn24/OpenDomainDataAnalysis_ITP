		<title>06INDUSTRY PAST, GRAINTHORPE.</title>
		<content> Even prior to the Conquest,{salting}  
 was extremely important,in this       
 area.The survey refers to 23 Salterns 
 at Grainthorpe and Marshchapel and    
 records show salt rent was still being
 collected in the early 1600's.        
 The salt industry appears to have     
 disappeared when sea banks were raised
 to reclaim new land for pasture. The  
 visible remains,to the east of the    
 main road, are very conspicuous as low
 mounds.                               
 The salt route from Grainthorpe was   
 from Beacon Hill in Wragholme via     
 Salters' Lane, to Salters' Hill, to   
 Ludford,  and on via Saltergate to    
 Lincoln and then onto Newark.         
 Another chief feature was{            
{Grainthorpes' port, Swineshaven       
{Harbour,}now silted up since the sea  
 retreated: needed 2 custom's officers 
 and exported huge quantities of wool. </content>
