    This is a game for 11 year         
 olds. You have a boys side and a girls
 side. The boys go after the girls.    
 When you are caught you stand by a    
 post or in a box at the corner of the 
 playground. It is up to the other     
 girls to free you by touching you on  
 the hand. If they get caught then they
 end up in the box as well. When all   
 the girls are caught they have to     
 catch all the boys. It is best if you 
 have the same number of boys as girls.
 A good number to have on each side is 
 10. If everyone plays fairly, woofers 
 can be a really good game.
