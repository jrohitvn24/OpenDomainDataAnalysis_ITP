		<title>01Indian Queens and District.</title>
		<content>     There are really three villages in
 one that have joined together over the
 years along two main roads -the A30   
 and the A39.Indian Queens is on the   
 A30,St.Columb Road is on the A39 and  
 Fraddon is where the two roads join   
 for a while before separating again.  
 Indian Queens and St.Columb Road are  
 joined by the A392 road which goes on 
 to Newquay and the sea.If you take the
 B3279 road from Indian Queens towards 
 St.Dennis you are going into the clay 
 pit district where there are white    
 mountains of waste from the clay pits.
 If you come to Indian Queens from     
 Bodmin along the A30 you pass through 
 moorland called the Goss Moors.As you 
 enter Fraddon both the A30 and the A39
 join,but at the end of Fraddon the    
 roads separate again,the A30 going    
 towards Redruth and the A39 going     
 towards Truro.                        </content>
