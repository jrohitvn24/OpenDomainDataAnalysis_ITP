		<title>18ROAD SURVEY,TEST VALLEY</title>
		<content>  Although this is a rural area,with   
 very few people living here, there is 
 an important crossroads in the area.  
  The main road from Bournemouth to    
 Winchester (A31) crossed the main road
 from Southampton to Salisbury and Bath
 (A36).The old crossroads was changed  
 when the new M27 was constructed and a
 roundabout now takes traffic from     
 Bournemouth to Portsmouth without     
 passing through Southampton.          
  These are busy main roads and there  
 are some dual carriageways.There are  
 still,however,many narrow,winding     
 country lanes which twist between high
 hedges.Bridleways cross the area,     
 especially near the river,and these   
 are used by riding schools.           
  Although most people living here have
 cars,there are regular bus services   
 along the main roads.There is a twice 
 weekly shopping service on minor roads</content>
