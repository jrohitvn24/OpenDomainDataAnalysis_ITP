		<content> The R.A.F. station opened in 1941.    
 Today it employs 1200 service people  
 and 200 civilians. Runways are no     
 longer used but the land is let to    
 local farmers for grazing and silage  
 crops. The camp is operational and    
 deals with engineering, radar and     
 cadet training. There are two areas of
 married quarters but many service     
 people live in neighbouring villages  
 after first receiving permission from 
 the Commanding Officer. The camp has a
 NAAFI store, a bank and a doctor and  
 dentist. There are clubs and societies
 run on the camp for service people and
 their families, some of which are open
 to members of the general public who  
 belong to specific organizations such 
 as members of the Scouting Movement.  
 Christian worship is provided either  
 on the camp or in the local parish    
 church by 3 chaplains.                </content>
