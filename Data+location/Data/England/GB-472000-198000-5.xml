		<title>05A walk in the winter</title>
		<content>In January 1985 Mrs Trotman,a local    
amateur naturalist,took Alex, Imogen,  
Lynn,Scott and me, and me,Tamsin, for a
walk in the snow.First we saw rabbit's 
footprints.They went two together and  
then one right across the field.We     
climbed over a gate and saw a dead     
shrew.It had blood on its nose.With it 
were the footprints of a fox.The fox   
may have jumped ont the shrew but did  
not like the taste and put it down. We 
used the binoculars to look at a hare  
about two fields away.Suddenly Alex saw
a hare in the same field as us.We      
followed the footprints.Hares run very 
fast.Suddenly we heard a noise.It was a
curlew.We looked through the binoculars
at the curlew in the next field.After  
the walk we went to Mrs Trotman's house
for a drink of hot orange.We watched   
thebirds in her garden.There were      
robins,blackbirds,and bluetits.        </content>
