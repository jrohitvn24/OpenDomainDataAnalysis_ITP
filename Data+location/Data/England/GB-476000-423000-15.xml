		<title>15Hook/Skelton Railway Bridge</title>
		<content>  The railway bridge in{Hook}was built 
 in{1868}.The bridge goes over the{    
{River Ouse}.The{Hook}and{Skelton      
{railway Bridge}is made of cast iron.If
 ships want to go through they have to 
 wait until the bridge swings open.The 
 bridge is 253 metres long.In{1868}the 
 bridge was{the second largest double- 
{line swing bridge in the World.}      
  During both World Wars the bridge was
 the main crossing point from the north
 to the south coast and so was bombed  
 by both Zeppelins and German Bombers. 
 The{Hook and Skelton Railway Bridge   
 has been damaged many times by ships. 
 British rail was unable to claim      
 compensation for its repair.By        
 threatening to close the line between 
{Goole}and{Gilbedyke,}it prompted the  
 local authority to pay just under Â£1  
 million towards its repair.The line   
 has been saved and everyone is happy. </content>
