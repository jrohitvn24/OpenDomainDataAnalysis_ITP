		<content>Yardley Hastings is very old .It dates 
back to the Saxon times.The majority of
the cottages are made from limestone   
which was dug from local quarries      
The roofs are made out of Pantiles or  
Slate or  are Thatched and the         
interior walls are of wattle and       
daub.Most of the building materials    
were produced locally in the           
brick-yard at Castle Ashby.Since most  
of Yardley Hastings is within a        
conservation area difficulties arise   
from time to time, in obtaining such   
materials as matching   pantiles ,when 
alterations or repairs are made to the 
buildings                              
 The oldest buildings in the village   
are the Church of St.Andrew which is   
late Norman (C12),and the Court Palour 
which is probably C14,and is now       
classed as an historical monument.
