		<title>07BROMYARD - ATHIS EXCHANGE</title>
		<content>    In 1979, Bromyard received a       
 request from{Ross-on-Wye}for a town to
 twin with{Athis}in{Normandy, France.}A
 group of{Queen Elizabeth High School {
 pupils visited Athis for 2 weeks to   
 stay with French children of the same 
 age. Various trips were organised     
 visiting places of interest. The      
 numbers now vary between 17 and 30    
 with children{aged 13-15.}The exchange
 takes place annually in May and June. 
    As a natural extension of the      
 school exchange, the town twinning    
 took place. A group of people from    
 Bromyard visited Athis before the     
 exchange began. In return, some people
 from Athis came to Bromyard, also     
 before the official start in 1980.    
    The English visit Athis in the     
 Whitson weekend. The French visit     
 Bromyard during the{Gala weekend}in   
 the first week of{July.               </content>
