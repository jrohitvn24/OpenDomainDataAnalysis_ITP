		<content> Most people like to swim.  Some like  
 to swim in rivers but most like to    
 swim in a swimming pool like me.  My  
 name is Paul Fryer and my hobby is    
 swimming but I don't swim just for    
 pleasure. I like to swim for other    
 people.  I'm in the Andover Swimming  
 Club and I go training every Monday,  
 Tuesday and Thursday.  I go at half   
 past eight every night.  I've been in 
 the Andover swimming squad for just   
 under a year now and I have been in 25
 galas since then.  My most successful 
 gala was at a town called Guildford   
 when Andover beat l6 other towns and  
 we won the first division shield.  My 
 second most successful was when we    
 were against France and we won by 258 
 to 225.  We won a gold cup.  Sometimes
 I go to diving club at l0 o'clock till
 ll o'clock and that is every Friday.  
 I love swimming.                      </content>
