		<content>    BAR HILL QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY      
    Initially our survey was part of a 
 class topic and nothing to do with the
 Domesday Project.We first sent our    
 questionnaires to parents of children 
 in our class only.Forty-seven of these
 were returned and we found the results
 very interesting.When we started the  
 Domesday Project we decided to send   
 the questionnaires out to the parents 
 of children in the whole school,senior
 citizens,married couples with no      
 children and single people.We had 579 
 returned.There is a population of     
 around 4,000 in Bar Hill at the moment
 so we thought our sample was quite    
 good as it was well spread and covered
 roughly 12.5% of total population.
