The Post Office is the only shop in the
village.It provides a service to       
Hanging Houghton as well as Lamport.   
  The postman delivers the newspapers  
as well as the post.His wife keeps a   
very small stock of other goods of     
great variety because the shop is so   
small.When she delivers the mail,she   
collects shopping lists from the old   
people who live in the cottages and    
once a week she goes into Northampton  
and buys the things they have asked    
for.                                   
The milkman doesnot just deliver the   
milk.He takes medical prescriptions    
from the doctor's surgery and changes  
their library books.
