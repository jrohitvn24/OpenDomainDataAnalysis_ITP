		<title>06FOLKLORE IN RADSTOCK.</title>
		<content> In Radstock children know rhymes which
 they use in games.There is Blue Bells 
 Cockleshells Evie Ivie Over,On the    
 Mountain,Under and Over and I am a    
 Little Bumper Car.                    
  In our block is a hill called Batson 
 Hill and legend has it that this hill 
 was the hill in a famous nursery      
 rhyme.                                
  There was once a quarry and a well at
 the top of Batson Hill.Years ago      
 people would climb up this hill to    
 fetch their water.Jack and Jill,a     
 married couple went to fetch a pail of
 water from the well.Then oneday Jack  
 was killed by a falling stone.Jill    
 died of a broken heart and left a son 
 whom the villagers called Jillson,a   
 name which is known today as Gilson.We
 believe that this is the original Jack
 and Jill story.
