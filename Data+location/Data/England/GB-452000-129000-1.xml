		<content> This area is to the east of the city  
 of Winchester. It is approximately in 
 the centre of the county of           
 Hampshire. The area is entirely rural 
 in character and would be best        
 described as 'undulating'. The highest
 points above sea level being about    
 100 metres. The area is               
 to the south of the river Itchen which
 flows westwards and then south to     
 enter the Solent at Southampton.      
 In some ways the block was difficult  
 to survey as it contains no entire    
 settlement;only small parts           
 thereof.The information               
 offered,however,should still give a   
 general impression of life in this    
 area in the year 1985 A.D.
