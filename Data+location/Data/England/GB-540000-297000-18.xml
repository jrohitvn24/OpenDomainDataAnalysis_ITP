		<title>18Transport in March</title>
		<content>  Most people rely on{public transport.
 The{station}is vital to the town.     
{Trains}are used for{children}attending
 public schools in Ely and Cambridge as
 well as{people working daily}in       
 Peterborough. Also many{shoppers}go to
 Peterborough. Many{goods}are delivered
 by train.                             
{ Cambus}operate{public bus services}to
 such places as Chatteris,Peterborough,
 Cambridge and Ely.{Emblings coaches   
 operate services to the{villages}round
 about. Bus services are not very      
 frequent.{Private coach firms}are used
 to bring children from outlying farms 
 and villages into school each day.    
{ Cycles}are used a lot in March as it 
 is such a{flat}area.                  
  This is not an ideal area for large  
{lorries}as there are no{motorways}and 
 the roads are very{bumpy}due to the   
{peat shrinkage}beneath them.          </content>
