		<title>10SANDFORD LIDO,CHELTENHAM</title>
		<content> Sandford Lido was built in 1935,the   
 pool being opened on Saturday,May     
 25th.On one side is the General       
 Hospital and on the other side is     
 Sandford Park through which the River 
 Chelt flows.Sandford Park was opened  
 in 1926 by the Duke and Duchess of    
 Beaufort.The lido costs 50p for       
 children and 80p for adults.On a very 
 hot day the lido will take more than  
 500 people.The most there's ever been 
 is about 5000 in a day. In 1972 a     
 lower,safer chute was put in,slanted  
 towards the shallow end.It took 8     
 months to build the lido and it cost  
 Â£16,000.Sandford Lido has two pools.In
 the big pool there are three diving   
 boards and two slides.The little pool 
 has one slide.The pools are very      
 popular with the people of Cheltenham 
 and we all love going there in the    
 summer when the water is really warm. </content>
