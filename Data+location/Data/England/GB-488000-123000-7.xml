		<content>{The Douglas Macmillan Ward,}situated  
 on the ground floor of the King Edward
 VII Hospital, caters solely for the   
 terminally ill.  At the moment there  
 are 9 beds available, though this     
 number will be extended to 22 later   
 this year.  The beds are paid for by  
 the{National Society for Cancer       
{Relief.} Home Care Sisters operate    
 from this ward, caring for the        
 patients in their homes and also      
 giving support to their families.     
 Patients are finally admitted to the  
 ward when Home Care is no longer      
 viable.  Since patients in the        
 Macmillan Ward know they have come    
 there to die one would probably       
 imagine it to be a most depressing    
 place, but, on the contrary, the      
 atmosphere is very happy and much     
 warmth and love are generated.
