		<title>15SMEATHARPE - HEALTH SERVICES</title>
		<content> The nearest doctor's surgery for the  
 people of Smeatharpe is at Churchin-  
 ford, over 2 kilometres away.  There  
 is a dispensary within the building   
 where patients can obtain medicines.  
 Four General Practitioners and a      
 Nursing Sister are there on a rota    
 basis five days a week. The main      
 health centre in which they are based 
 is at Hemyock, 9 kilometres from      
 Smeatharpe.                           
 The Accident and Emergency Unit at    
 East Reach Hospital, Taunton is the   
 nearest Casualty Department.  The     
 town's other hospital, Musgrove,      
 provides in-patient treatment, out-   
 patient clinics, and maternity        
 services.                             
 It is a tremendous problem for people,
 who do not have a car to get to       
 doctor's surgery or hospital at short 
 notice and have to rely on neighbours.</content>
