		<content>{(cont.from p.2)}Eastwards farmland has
 been overtaken by modern council &amp;    
 private housing,schools &amp; shops. The  
 mansion houses have new roles.        
 Evington Hall became a convent &amp; is   
 now a Catholic comprehensive school.  
 Evington House is a sports pavilion &amp; 
 its estate a public park. Even some   
 public buildings of the '30's &amp; '40's 
 have new uses,e.g The Lido,Scraptoft  
 Lane,was a swimming pool,became a     
 series of small factory units &amp; is now
 a hosiery factory. The Trocadera      
 cinema was pulled down to make way for
 a petrol station. Not only Wakerley's 
 'new town' but also the villages of   
 Humberstone &amp; Evington,once outside   
 the city bounderies,have become       
 urbanised &amp; it is difficult to imagine
 them once being separate communities.
