		<content>  We wanted to find out where people   
 who live in Kingswear worked.We       
 collected information  by sending a   
  questionaire home to the parents of  
 the children in Kingswear             
 school.We asked how man members of    
 eaeh family worked and we asked them  
 to indicate whether they woked in     
  Kingswear, Paignton,Totnes,Newton    
 Abbot,Brixham,Dartmouth or some other 
 place.The results were very           
 interesting:                          
       20 families responded.          
    In 9 families one person worked    
    In 10   "     two people   "       
    In 1    "     three "      "

 furthest anyone travelled daily was to
