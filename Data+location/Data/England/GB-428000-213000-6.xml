		<content>   The people in our village are       
friendly and caring about their        
surroundings. New people in our        
village are different because they are 
not so friendly.                       
   The most common family size here is 
4. The commonest women's ages are      
33years and 10years and the commonest  
man's age is 11.The most common boy's  
name is Peter. The most common girl's  
name is Sarah.                         
   We think that the old people are    
much more friendly than the young      
people.                                
   Our Vicar is called Mr Smith. Mr    
Smith is a very kind man and if you go 
down to his house he always gives you  
two toffees.                           
   Mrs Godfrey is our caretaker for the
school. She comes up and goes down on  
a little motor scooter. We call her    
Super Gran.                            </content>
