		<content> Yesterday we visited East Roughlea    
 Farm(June 1985).                      
 The farmer showed us the manure       
 spreader.There were metal poles and a 
 chain.The manure is put between the   
 poles and when it moves the chain     
 pulls the manure.At the end are blades
 which cut the manure before it goes in
 the ground.                           
 He showed us his seed spreader.There  
 was a big container where the seeds   
 are stacked.We could not touch the    
 seed because it had insect killer on. 
 The seed comes out of the bottom of   
 the container.He has a special rake   
 which fixes onto his tractor to push  
 the seeds into the ground.            
 He has a combined harvester.It cuts   
 the corn and seperates the grain from 
 the stalks.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
