		<title>06Coarse Fishing-River Severn</title>
		<content>     The River Severn is the third     
 longest river in England.The fish you 
 would catch are eels.The young eels or
{elvers}return to the river in         
 spring after swimming many miles.     
 These are a favourite meal,so many are
 caught.The Severn is a murky river    
 that's why you catch eels mostly.The  
 Severn runs through most parts of     
 Gloucestershire.In some places it's   
 slow and others fast.The river is a   
 busy river because boats are always   
 coming up and down.On the other side  
 there is mostly grass and opposite the
 boating lake there are the houses of  
 Pool Meadow.We go fishing at 10am and 
 return at 5pm.We take a packed lunch. 
 Before we start to fish we put our    
 tackle on,which is a float or         
 leadger,hooks and for bait we use     
 maggots and worms.We catch mainly     
{bream and eels.                       </content>
