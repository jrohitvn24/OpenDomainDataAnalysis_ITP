		<title>14HUTTON ESTATE - GARDEN</title>
		<content>   To the immediate Northwest of       
 Hutton-in-the-Forest is the site of an
 early Eighteenth Century walled       
 garden, walled on two sides, and      
 enclosed by a high hedge on two       
 others, under the immediate           
 supervision of Mr. B. Pedder.         
   In the immediate post war period,   
 much of this was turned over to market
 gardening - unsuccessfully. Now that  
 the home is open to the public it is  
 intended to turn it back into a formal
 garden to complement the home. Plans  
 are being drawn up with the help of   
 Miss U. Buchan.                       
   It is intended to retain the        
 existing layout of yew and fruit      
 trees, filling in with beds and gravel
 walks as appropriate, removing the    
 vestiges of the commercial operation, 
 including derelict greenhouses.
