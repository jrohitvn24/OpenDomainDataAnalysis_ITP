		<content> As Mayor of Peterborough, I am pleased
 to introduce readers of the new       
 Domesday Book to the City of 1986.    
                                       
 Peterborough is a growing city which  
 has almost doubled to its present     
 population of over 140,000 in fifteen 
 years. It is a young city with 24%    
 of its people aged under 16. It is a  
 lively city whose business, shopping, 
 sporting and recreational facilities  
 are of the highest quality.           
                                       
 As we move towards the 1990's, I have 
 every confidence that the citizens,   
 their elected Council and all who work
 in industry and commerce in the City  
 will make Peterborough a still better 
 place for our children and the future 
 generations who may read this message.
                                       
      {R.E.Burke,}Mayor of Peterborough</content>
