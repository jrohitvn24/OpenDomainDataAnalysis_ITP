 From Marshalls airport, Premier       
 Airlines operate a thrice weekly      
 service to the Channel Islands.       
   A charter service also operates by  
 the 'Midas' company.                  
  Because of its nearness to Newmarket 
 the airport specialises in ferrying   
 racehorses to all parts of the world, 
 and even has its own stables at the   
 airport.                              
 In 1954 the Marshall Group had to     
 build a 6000 feet new runway to       
 accommodate the large jet planes and  
 in 1984 had to build two vast hangars 
 which can house 5 large jet liners    
 which come in for modifications.
