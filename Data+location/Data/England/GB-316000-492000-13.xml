 Frith Hall is a ruin and it belongs to
 my family.It was built in 1680 and has
 been a hunting lodge,inn farm.We have 
 an old notice about poachers at Frith 
 Hall being punished in 1800.The ghost 
 of William Marshall haunts it.He died 
 in 1736.                              
                                       
 Old Hall                              
  Old Hall is a very old ruin.It had a 
 pele tower and the walls were six feet
 thick.A story says that one of the    
 last wolves in England was chasing a  
 lady at Old Hall.She fell in a deep   
 dub and drowned.                      
  Grime Crag                           
   Is near Lowerys.It was occupied in  
 1881.It says in the church records    
 that someone was buried there.        </content>
