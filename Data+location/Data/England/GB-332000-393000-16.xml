		<title>16EVERTON FOOTBALL CLUB.</title>
		<content>  {Everton}were the best team this     
 year,they have played great football  
 against other sides,even against      
{Liverpool,}which is my team.They were 
 the{League Champions and European Cup 
{Winners Cup}winners beating{Rapid     
{Vienna}in{Rotterdam,}a brilliant match
 that everyone enjoyed. The{Everton    
 player I like is{Peter Reid.}He is a  
 smashing player who was voted player  
 of the year.{Everton}had a side that  
 was unstoppable this year.They were   
 winning nearly all their matches.     
{Everton}could have also done a treble 
 but{Manchester United}stopped them by 
 winning the{F.A.Cup. Everton}can now  
 enter the{European Cup}but because of 
 the terrible incident in{Brussels     
 where a lot of people were killed,the 
 team have been banned. I think it is a
 shame as it was the{Liverpool}fans    
 who helped cause the trouble.{(Carl)  </content>
