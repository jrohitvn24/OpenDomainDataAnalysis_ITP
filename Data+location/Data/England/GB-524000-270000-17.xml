		<title>17SAILING IN HUNTINGDON.</title>
		<content> Sailing  is a popular water sport on  
 reservoirs, lakes and flooded gravel  
 pits.The boats are made from wood or  
 glassfibre,and their sails from       
 terylene.Masts are made from wood or  
 aluminium. The boats are looked after 
 by their owners and are left at the   
 club during the summer.Repairs are    
 done at home in the winter.There are  
 many different kinds of sailing       
 dinghy and each kind is given  a      
 handicap figure.The rules are         
 controlled by the international yacht 
 racing union.To join a club people ask
 and if accepted pay a fee of around   
 Â£35 per year.They race to handicap    
 rules and sail for fun to find who is 
 the best sailor each week.It helps to 
 keep them fit, and helps get away from
 work.
