		<content> During the Middle Ages, Wolvey was a  
 thriving town of{KNITTERS}and millers 
 with about 27{WINDMILLS.}The high     
 position of Wolvey made it accessible 
 to cooling winds to drive the mills.  
 Only 4 windmills existed in the early 
 1800's and the last to remain was sold
 and pulled down in 1909. The demand   
 for white flour was the death knell of
 the mills for they could only produce 
 wholemeal.                            
 During the 1800's stocking-making was 
 the main{INDUSTRY}of the villagers and
 for a time the stockingers were able  
 to hold their own against the new     
 machinery by taking wage-cuts.        
 Eventually the machines won and those 
 villagers who could not find work left
 the village for the town.             
 The{POPULATION} in 1851 was 963,      
 reducing to 693 in 1901 and in 1921 it
 was 686.                              </content>
