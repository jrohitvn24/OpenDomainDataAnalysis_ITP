{OLD CUSTOMS.}                         
 Many old customs have died out and    
 some are not now allowed by law i.e.  
 Bull and Bear Baiting. Most of the    
 traditions connected with Mobberley   
 took place during Wakes Week in       
 October. Such as Quoiting, Goose      
 pulling, Duck hunting and Wrestling.  
 Frummerty (a special porridge) was    
 eaten at this time. Wakes week is no  
 longer celebrated, neither are -      
 beating the bounds, rush bearing, bell
 ringing, marling and roping the Bride 
 &amp; Groom -  holding a rope across the  
 path of the Bride &amp; Groom and exacting
 a toll before they could pass.        
{PARISH COUNCILS.                      
 Two burleymen have been appointed to  
 Mobberley Parish Council for centuries
 and are still appointed to date. They 
 assess damage done by farming stock.  </content>
