		<title>11THE BULSTONE BRANSCOMBE.</title>
		<content> The Bulstone is a guest house.It used 
 to be a farm as well.The people who   
 own it are the Freemans.They've got   
 some animals,two donkeys, some goats, 
 some ducks, some hens and cockerels,  
 some geese, some cats and their       
 kittens.The Bulstone can take eight or
 nine familes at a time.They sell      
 ice-creams. They give goats' milk to  
 the guests when they have it. They    
 also have eggs from the chickens.     
  Two boys help to do things like      
 cutting hedges and clearing stones.   
 They have cleared a field full of     
 stones, and grass is growing there now
 and when the grass has grown the      
 freemans will erect a wooden adventure
 playground.Two girls help in the      
 kitchen.The guest house is also a     
 reastaurant open for morning coffees  
 cream teas and evening meals.
