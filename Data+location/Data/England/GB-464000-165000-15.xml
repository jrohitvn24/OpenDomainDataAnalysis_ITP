		<content> The Willink School is the local centre
 for evening classes and the village   
 library,whilst the new village hall,  
 although too small for sports activ-  
 ities,is used by many groups for meet-
 ings,receptions and fund-raising      
 events.Regular clubs include a camera 
 society,a drama society and the well- 
 established Horticultural Society.For 
 the zealous gardeners,there is a much-
 used allotment site.                  
  However,despite the many activities  
 available,many teenagers in the area  
 feel left out,and vandalism is becom- 
 ing an increasing problem.Many people 
 feel that the extensive residential   
 development should be accompanied by  
 suitable leisure development,and a    
 local sports centre for family-use has
 been called for.                      
  The many public houses in the area   
 are also a major leisure resource.    </content>
