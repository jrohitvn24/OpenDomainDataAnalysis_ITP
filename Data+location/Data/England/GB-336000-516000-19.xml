 STATION WITH ONE FIRE TENDER AND A    
 VOLUNTARY FIRE FIGHTING CREW.  WE ALSO
 HAVE A SUB-POLICE STATION WITH ONE    
 POLICE MAN. HE USUALLY USES A CAR BUT 
 SOMETIMES HE USES A MOTORBIKE. THE    
 MOUNTAIN GOAT RUNS PEOPLE FROM        
 WINDERMERE TO GLENRIDDING AND BACK

 SUMMER. THE LONGEST RIDE IS TO POOLEY 
 BRIDGE AND BACK. THERE ARE QUITE A LOT
 OF DIFFERENT SHOPS IN THE
