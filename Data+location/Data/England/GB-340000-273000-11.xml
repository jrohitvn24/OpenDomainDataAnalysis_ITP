		<content> In Leintwardine there are three       
 factories which make large machinery  
 and conveyor belts out of long sheets 
 of steel. The three factories employ  
 fifteen people.                       
 There are two garages in Leintwardine 
 which employ twenty people either full
 or part time.There are two road       
 haulage firms, Jukes and Archers,     
 employing thirteen men.In Downton on  
 the Lennox Estate there are eighteen  
 workers. There is a water/ sewage     
 works where two men work. A survey of 
 the fathers of the schoolchildren     
 showed 23 different occupations. As   
 might be expected in this area Farming
 proved to be the commonest with 10    
 (27%) fathers employed in farming.    
 Some of them owned their farm,some    
 were farm managers and some were farm 
 labourers. Other significant returns  
 were builders (8%)lorry drivers (8%). </content>
