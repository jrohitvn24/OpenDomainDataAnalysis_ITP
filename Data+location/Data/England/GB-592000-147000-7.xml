 Charing is well served for a village  
of its size. There is an hourly bus    
service to Maidstone and Ashford, with 
buses to Canterbury leaving less often.
 Charing has a main line railway       
station with trains calling at all     
stations to Maidstone and then on to   
Victoria, London, and hourly trains to 
Ashford.                               
 There is a Primary School in School   
Road. At the end of School Road there  
is a Fire Station with a drill tower   
in the yard. There are two Police      
Houses further down School  Road, in   
one of which lives P.C. Gifford, the   
local Constable.                       
 In Station Road there is a Doctor's   
Surgery with four practising Doctors   
and a dispensary.                      
 There is a telephone exchange and a   
library in the village.                </content>
