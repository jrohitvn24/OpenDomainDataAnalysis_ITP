		<title>08OYSTER FARMING AT PYEFLEET</title>
		<content> The oysters produced at Pyefleet are  
 the Colchester Native and the Pacific.
 They feed on the nutrients brought    
 into the Pyefleet from the surrounding
 saltings when these are flooded.Native
 oysters were depleted by disease in   
 1981 and now can only be bred in      
 disease-free areas.The Colne Oyster   
 Fishing Company breeds Colchester     
 Native oysters in Loch Ryan in        
 Scotland,and brings the young oysters 
 back to the Pyefleet to mature.       
 They are dredged up at 6 years old,   
 hand cleaned of weeds and barnacles,  
 and kept for 2 days in sterile sea    
 water to free them of bacteria.They   
 are sold alive,with their shells      
 firmly closed,for eating except during
 the breeding season,May to August.    
 Pacific oysters are only matured in   
 the Pyefleet.They do not breed in this
 country.                              </content>
