Tom is aged 11 and he has four sisters.
He walks to school as he lives over    
the road from his primary school, in   
Parkland, and he has lived in Freeland 
for five years.  Tom's mum shops in    
Witney.                                
                                       
Tom doesn't collect anything and       
doesn't belong to the cubs. He has a   
guinea pig. He doesn't like swimming.  
There is a playing field in Freeland.  
                                       
Tom's favourite subject at school is   
football. They have two playtimes at   
school each day.                       
                                       
Tom does not like school dinners, so   
he has sandwiches.
