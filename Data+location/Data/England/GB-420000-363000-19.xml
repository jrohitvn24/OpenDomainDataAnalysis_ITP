		<content> In the summer the children go down to 
 the dale to swim in the river. The    
 river is dammed up so it is deep      
 enough to swim in: the river would be 
 about 2 metres deep. About 20 people  
 swim in the river at any one time.    
 Also in the dale the children go      
 catching bullyheads. They turn the    
 rocks over and put their hands on the 
 bottom. They also play out on their   
 bikes or go down to the playing       
 fields, where there are swings, slides
 and other play equipment, two tennis  
 courts, a football pitch and a cricket
 square. Also in the summer the        
 children go hay-making with their     
 friends who live on the farms. In the 
 winter children stay inside and play  
 on a computer, at monopoly, watch     
 television or read quietly. Scotch    
 arrows is the "in" game at the moment.
