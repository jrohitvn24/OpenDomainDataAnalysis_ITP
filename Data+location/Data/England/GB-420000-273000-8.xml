		<title>08A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> My age is 11 and I become 12 in       
 September. My day begins at 7.30 am,  
 that is when I get up and change in to
 my school uniform. I tidy my room then
 go down for breakfast. It's Cornflakes
 and Hot chocolate again.(MMmm!) After 
 breakfast I go to the bathroom and    
 have a wash and clean my teeth.(It is 
 now about 8.20 am), I get my school   
 bag ready then read, at the moment I  
 am reading a series of books about    
 Super Gran by Forrest Wilson. They are
 humorous books about a little old lady
 called Granny Smith , telling how she 
 uses her super powers. At 8.40 am, I  
 get on my shoes, coat, and bag to go  
 to school.                            
 At 9.00 am, the bell goes and we all  
 go in. Our first subject is assembly. 
 We sing two hymns, have a story from  
 our headmaster, and then go to our    
 class lessons.                        </content>
