		<content>{MR.P STONE}HAS LIVED IN THE{FLEET AREA
 ALMOST FIFTY YEARS.HE LIVES ON        
{CHICKERELL ROAD}JUST OUTSIDE          
{CHICKERELL VILLAGE.}LIFE IS LESS      
 PEACEFUL TODAY BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE 
 CARS AND LORRIES, BUT YEARS AGO THERE 
 WERE ONLY HORSE DRAWN CARTS. THE{POST 
{OFFICE}HAS CHANGED BECAUSE MORE OLD   
 AGED PENSIONERS USE IT MORE THAN      
                                       
 BEFORE. HE DOESN'T LIKE THE NEW       
 BUILDINGS GOING ON IN THE VILLAGE     
 BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE  
 AS THE OLD ONES. THE GREATEST CHANGE  
 IS                                    
 THE MAIN DRAINAGE. THE OLD FASHIONED  
 TOILETS WERE SIMPLY A WOODEN HUT AT   
 THE BOTTOM OF HE GARDEN. INSIDE WAS A 
 BUCKET WHICH THEY USED FOR A TOILET.  
 EVERY WEEK THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY USED
 TO PUT IT ON THE DUNG HEAP TO USE FOR 
 MANURE.                               </content>
