This area has the Staffordshire County 
Council as its local Education         
Authority.   It is a two-tier system,  
with primary schools for the 5-11 year 
age-group and secondary schools for    
the 11-16 year olds.   Those wishing to
continue their education beyond the    
statutory minimum but travel into      
Newcastle-under-Lyme or Stoke to a     
college of further education or        
tertiary college.   Although there is  
only one secondary school within this  
Domesday Project block, the Primary    
Schools from the east of Apedale, in   
fact those who have contributed to this
database, do not send their pupils on  
to Chesterton High School, but to a    
neighbouring one since they are not in 
the same "catchment area".
