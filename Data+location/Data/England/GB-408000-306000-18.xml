		<title>18WATERWORKS, LICHFIELD.</title>
		<content>  Sandfields is the Company's oldest   
Pumping Station having formed part of  
the original supply scheme authorised  
by the South Staffordshire Waterworks  
Act 1853. The Ajacent treatment works  
were completed in 1927 and in addition 
to the filtration plant, washwater and 
sludge disposal facilities, the        
buildings include the Company's        
Northern Area Office housing 26        
administration and technical staff     
with responsibility for a workforce of 
approx. 54 men covering Cannock,       
Burton, Uttoxeter and outlying areas.  
The office staff deal with all         
enquiries from consumers and developers
within these areas, and ensure that the
supply of potable water is maintained  
within the needs of the distribution   
system which requires constant         
monitoring to enable every consumer to 
receive an adequate supply of water.   </content>
