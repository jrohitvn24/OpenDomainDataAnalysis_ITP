		<content> One of the trends of current homelife 
 is the amount of domestic pets kept in
 the home. Owners going on holiday need
 to find somewhere to put them and in  
 this area Marshfoot Cattery, Hailsham 
 will look after your cat in the lap of
 luxury. It is a purpose built         
 establishment run solely by a         
 redundant P.E. Teacher who used her   
 redundancey money 3 years ago to      
 assist setting up the business.       
 Perhaps a sign of the 1980s but a     
 pampered pet can expect heating &amp;     
 comfort in its own insulated chalet.  
 Fancy food fads as well as ordinary   
 food is catered for. The main         
 requirements are cats be vaccinated   
 against feline enteritis &amp; cat flu. An
 insurance scheme is availble in case  
 emergency veterinary attention is     
 necessary.                            
                                       </content>
