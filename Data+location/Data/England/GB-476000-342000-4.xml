		<title>04Recreation in a rural area</title>
		<content> Recreation is something which for the 
 most part residents in this area have 
 to travel.None of the four villages   
 has a sporting team of any kind i.e.  
 Cricket,football.There are no sports  
 grounds or facilities for sport.So    
 recreation is partaken of in each     
 others homes in the form of social    
 gatherings or the public meeting place
 in this survey,the W.I. Hall at       
 Kilvington,where whist drives etc.    
 take place.Many of the women in the   
 area belong to a local W.I.There are  
 two which meet in this area-one at    
 Shelton meeting in a large house of   
 one member.The ladies of Thoroton go  
 to a W.I. at Orston.Most residents    
 would consider their main recreation  
 watching T.V.,travelling out of the   
 area for all sport except fox and     
 beagle hunting which is a popular     
 sport here,as is fishing.             </content>
