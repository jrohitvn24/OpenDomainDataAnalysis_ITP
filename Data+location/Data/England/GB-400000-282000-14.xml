   Litter &amp; vandalism are two of the   
main social concerns in our area.      
Vandals make our area look a mess.     
They wreck anything they can for       
pleasure, for kicks or just because    
they are bored. Examples of vandalism  
were;- writing on sides of houses,     
garages, lamposts; broken road signs,  
broken or carved trees &amp; telephone     
boxes smashed.                         
   Vandalism could be reduced if       
parents brought their children up to   
have more respect for property,        
older people &amp; themselves.             
   Our main shopping centre is very    
untidy &amp; full of litter. We found sweet
wrappings, chip papers etc. thrown on  
the floor, although litter-bins were   
provided.There were plastic bags of    
rubbish in hedgerows.                  </content>
