		<title>01Glaisdale Moor</title>
		<content> The southern part is higher heather   
 moorland used for sheep grazing and   
 grouse shootig but a large area is    
 taken up by Upper Glaisdale valley and
 in the north west by Great Fryup Dale.
 These steep sided valleys being more  
 sheltered are farmed, mainly sheep and
 cattle grazing. There are some fairly 
 large commerical conifer plantation on
 the slopes, and a scattering of       
 dieciduous woodland in the valleys.   
 There are no villages and the         
 residents all live in a scattering of 
 farms in the valleys and most will be 
 involved in farming. There are some   
 minor public road so access is easy   
 and the area is quite popular, being  
 closest to Eskdale, with tourists. The
 area is also much visited by walkers  
 who come to enjoy the spectacular     
 National park scenery
