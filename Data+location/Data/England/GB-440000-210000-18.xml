In the gradual improvement of the A40  
the road was moved a few yards to the  
south of Barnard Gate, to straighten   
out a bend, and the hamlet now has the 
appearance of a 'deserted village'. A  
short stretch of wide metalled but now 
hardly used road forms a sort of layby 
to the main road, with a few cottages  
and small farm buildings on either     
side. Its public house continues to    
function, though its size suggests that
it was built to cater for the trunk    
road traffic which must now use the    
'Evenlode', a Berni Inn on the opposite
side of the A40, and a 'Little Chef'   
restaurant that is also on the south of
the road, just outside our block. A    
tiny disused chapel constructed of wood
and corrugated iron still stands in the
hamlet, and just outside is the south  
gate and lodge to Eynsham Hall Park.   </content>
