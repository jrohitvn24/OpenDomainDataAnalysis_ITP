		<content> The Dallam Tower estate covers most of
 the land around Milnthorpe.Within the 
 estate there is woodland,parkland and 
 farmland of which Dallam Towers owns  
 numerouse farms.In the park,which is  
 open to the public,200 sheep are kept.
 Aswell as the sheep,the main          
 attraction of the park is the herd of 
 70 fallow deer.The trees in the park  
 were all planted deliberately and the 
 oldest trees are about 250 years old. 
 Another characteristic of the park is 
 the meandering River Bela which acts  
 as a natural boundary for the park.   
 In 1983 the main section of Dallam    
 Towers caught fire causing considrable
 damage.The present owner of Dallam    
 Towers is Brigadeer Tryon_Wilson.     
                                       
 Dallam Towers is not open to the      
 public exept on open days and for     
 charity events.                       </content>
