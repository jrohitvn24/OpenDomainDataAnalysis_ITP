		<content>  The sewage farm at{Shottermill}serves
 17000 people and every day 5000 to    
 6000 cubic metres of sewage pass      
 through the works. If it rains, the   
 figure rises to about 14000 cubic     
 metres as the drains empty into the   
 system.                               
  At the beginning of the sewage cycle 
 the plastics are chopped up in order  
 that they do not block up the works.  
 A special filter chamber removes the  
 sand and grit. In the primary tanks   
 the solids are separated and then     
 treated in the activated sludge       
 plant which, with the aid of bacteria,
 takes about nine hours to break down  
 the sludge. The liquid part is treated
 in filter-beds and emerges with only  
 20 parts per million of solids. The   
 sludge is further treated in a        
 digester where it is heated, thus     
 liberating the gases and removing much</content>
