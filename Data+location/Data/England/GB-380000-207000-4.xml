		<content>  The parish of Standish is very spread
 out. There is a population of between 
 two and three hundred. In the village,
 one of the main features is the       
 Almonry and the 14th century church   
 which lie next to each other. The     
 monks used to live in the Almonry and 
 pray in the Church. The Almonry is now
 the headquarters of the               
 Gloucestershire Trust for Nature      
 Conservation. There are two offices   
 and a shop open to the public.        
  Three famous people are connected    
 with Standish: Princess Diana, Winston
 Churchill and Bishop Frampton who is  
 buried in the church.
