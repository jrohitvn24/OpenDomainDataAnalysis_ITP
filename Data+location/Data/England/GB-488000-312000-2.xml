		<content> We live on the R.A.F. camp.On camp    
 there is a big sports-field where the 
 men play Hockey,Football and Rugby.   
 Sometimes they do Archery or jogging  
 round the field.Over the road there   
 are 2 tennis courts and by the courts 
 is the Officer's Mess.At the end of   
 the sports-field is Quorn Cresent     
 where the Station Commander lives.On  
 this camp there are people from three 
 nations:British, Italians and Germans.
 The men are here to fly the Tornados. 
 Sometimes a British pilot would fly   
 with a German navigator or an Italian 
 pilot would fly with a British        
 navigator.                            
 There are 4 hangers,A,B,C&amp;D, they are 
 made of bricks and steel.In the       
 hangers it is cold,it has a concrete  
 floor and is lit up at night.The      
 runway is solid concrete.There are    
 also inflatable hangers.              </content>
