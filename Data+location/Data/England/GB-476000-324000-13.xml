		<content> Few people have chosen to start new   
 businesses in this area. Two          
 exceptions are Mr King and Mr Walker. 
 Mr King's painting and decorating     
 business has been going for 21 years, 
 but it is only seven years since he   
 took over the old chapel in Scalford  
 as the base for his 21 man business.  
 Mr Walker set up his screen printing  
 business in Wycomb, where he works    
 alone, only five years ago.           
    Both men agree that it would be    
 easier to run their firms from the    
 town, though Mr Walker says it is very
 convenient to work at home.They both  
 travel some distance in running their 
 businesses. Mr Walker says he is happy
 most of the time, for he feels        
 he earns a fair amount of money for   
 work he enjoys doing. He does admit   
 however that his job gets a bit boring
 if there is a repetitive order to do. </content>
