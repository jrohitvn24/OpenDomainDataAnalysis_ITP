		<title>02HIGHAM FERRERS SHOE INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>Since 1860 the footwear industry has   
provided employment for plenty of      
people in the local area.To see how    
this has changed we went to Grensons   
and John Whites.                       
                                       
During the interview we were told that 
safety conditions had changed,in       
earlier days they had belt driven      
machines without guards.               
Today new technology means that        
machines have guards and are a lot     
safer. People used to lose fingers or  
arms but dangerous machinery has now   
been banned.                           
                                       
Whites produces shoes mainly for the   
domestic market but Grensons sell a lot
of shoes to Japan, U.S.A., Italy,      
France, Holland and Belgium.
