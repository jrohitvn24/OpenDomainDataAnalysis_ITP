		<content>    The{A52}is a major trunk route     
 joining{Derby}and{Grantham,}via       
{Nottingham.}It is a dual carriageway  
 road which carries a lot of heavy     
 traffic, both private and commercial  
 vehicles. The busiest times of the day
 see a heavy traffic flow of around 850
 vehicles an hour.                     
    The{mineral railway}passes over it 
 near to Radcliffe-on-Trent. From the  
 road we were able to see all the area 
 in our block.                         
    Fields of{grazing land}and{cereal  
{crops}can be seen on either side of   
 the road. About four miles out of     
 Nottingham there is a petrol filling  
 station with a new Happy Eater        
 restaurent adjoining it. Here         
 travellers can have a meal before     
 continuing their journey. Next to it  
 are two houses and{Holme Pierrepont
