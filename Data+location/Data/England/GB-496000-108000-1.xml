		<title>01Downs North East of Slindon</title>
		<content> The land rises gently form south to   
 north. The A29 Bognor to London road  
 passes south of Slindon and travels   
 north east using steep sided Fairmile 
 Bottom. South of the A29 are mixed    
 woods with two picnic areas and a     
 nature trail.  North of it is open    
 farmland with scattered woods on north
 - south spurs and valleys. Crops are  
 potatoes and grain.  Slindon village  
 is compact and mostly owned by the    
 National Trust.  Visitors are         
 attracted by pond, forge, lock up,    
 thatched post office, an annual       
 pumpkin display and by small flint    
 cottages which outnumber larger brick 
 houses.  Walkers enjoy long views from
 the footpaths across farmland         
 northwards towards the South Downs    
 Way.
