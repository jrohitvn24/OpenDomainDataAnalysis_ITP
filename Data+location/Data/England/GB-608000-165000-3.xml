		<content> Seasalter was once a centre of the    
 ancient salt making industry.Relics   
 of the Roman, Saxon and Norse origin  
 have been found in this area.         
 Whitstable is renowned for its oysters
 which were first exported in Roman    
 Times. Before the Norman Conquest the 
 Great Forest of Blean stretched to the
 edge of the higher ground of the      
 present town of Whitstable, and was   
 called "Northwoods".From this name the
 Manor of Northwood, a forerunner of   
 Whitstable took it's name.The Manor of
 Northwood may have been the Manor of  
 Dodeham.The name Whitstable came from 
 a staple, a pillar, and the white salt
 but some people think that the "Whit" 
 part comes from "Witan" council wise  
 men.                                  
 During the Middle Ages local people   
 were involed in agriculture and       
 seafaring.                            </content>
