		<title>16Cowtons' Social Concerns</title>
		<content> One of the main concerns in North     
 Cowton is the fall in the number of   
 children attending the village school.
 Attendances have fallen from over 60  
 to 32 this year. One reason is the    
 high prices of houses in the village. 
 They are often bought by older people 
 with no young family, or young couples
 who do not intend to start a family.  
 Parents with young children cannot    
 afford to buy the houses, and there is
 no local employment to attract them.  
 If the trend continues, the school    
 might have to be closed.              
 Another cause for concern in both     
 villages is vandalism, caused by young
 people, who perhaps have little else  
 to do. Youths driving their cars at   
 speed around the village green late at
 night cause disturbance to residents. 
 Dogs fouling the pavements is annoying
 and nobody has yet been fined for this</content>
