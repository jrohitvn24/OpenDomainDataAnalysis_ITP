		<content>  An interview with Brian Summers a    
 general reporter with Wolverhampton   
 Express and Star.                     
  The paper covers region of 1000square
 miles from Stafford to Hereford,      
 Worcester to Telford. Even sold in    
 coastal towns of Wales in summer so   
 midlanders can read news of home.     
 240,000 papers go out each day,read by
 an estimated four million people. The 
 main ain of the Express and Star is to
 cover national news and stories of    
 local interest. Photographs are also  
 very important. There are pages for   
 women, sport, motoring,business.      
  There is little for children except  
 for colour cartoons in Saturday       
 edition. Would be a good idea to in   
 clude more, if children suggest things
 they would like to see. Paperb is     
 financed by advertising mainly as cost
 of 16p is very low.                   </content>
