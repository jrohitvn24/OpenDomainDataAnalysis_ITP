		<content>   I go through the gates into the     
 playground at 8.30 a.m. - good, about 
 twenty minutes to play cricket with my
 friends before the whistle blows.     
   Assembly at 9 a.m.; we sing a hymn, 
 listen to all the teachers giving out 
 notices then the headmaster reads a   
 prayer.                               
   Back to the classroom for maths, my 
 favourite, I am doing some work on the
 temperatures of water as it cools.    
   After playtime I have to go to the  
 library to sort out a problem with    
 library tickets as I am a library     
 monitor. Then I work on my topic about
 insects, this week I am finding out   
 about ants.                           
   Soon it is 12.15 p.m. and time for  
 lunch. In the afternoon we have sci-  
 ence; practical work, we try several  
 experiments on sliding pieces of wood 
 on different surfaces with weights.   </content>
