  {St. Thomas' Church Biggin}was built 
 in{1848}by{William Evans}and cost     
 about{Â£1203.}It is built of{local     
{limestone}from a field near Liffs road
 which is still called Church Field.To 
 help to keep the cost of the church   
 down the local people fetched the     
 stone with their own horse and cart   
 after work.                           
   The{Tower}is approx 30 metres high  
 with a{clock which has recently been  
{restored.}There is a stained glass    
 window above the altar.               
   A special service was held in{1985  
 to mark the inauguration of the{new   
{organ.                                
    In{1984 a Flower Fetival}was held  
 for the first time.This was so        
 successful that another was held in   
{1985}with{LOVE}as the theme.
