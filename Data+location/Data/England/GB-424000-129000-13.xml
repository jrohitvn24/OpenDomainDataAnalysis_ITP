		<title>13West Tytherley Village</title>
		<content> This picturesque village is mentioned 
 in the Domesday Book as Tederleg -    
 meaning 'Young Wood'.To-day, over 500 
 people live in the village and        
 woodland is still in evidence but with
 a change from deciduous to coniferous 
 trees taking place.The population is  
 slightly elderley though there is a   
 reasonable cross section for age.A    
 problem for young families is the cost
 of housing and the lack of new        
 building.The village is away from main
 roads and is effectively planned for  
 centres of activity and meeting points
 e.g.the Black Horse Pub,the recreation
 ground,the village shop/Post Office,  
 School,Church,chapel and a splendid   
 village hall provided by the          
 Washington Singer family of Norman    
 Court in 1911.This is a friendly      
 village with social events.
