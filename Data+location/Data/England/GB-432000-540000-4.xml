		<content>      The weather changes every        
 day. Today the weather has been sunny 
 with sun showers. The date is the     
 eleventh of June. Michael and I       
 have measured the temperatures.We do  
 this in all the classrooms, hall, and 
 even the dining_room of our school.The
 outside temperatures are always       
 colder than the inside temperatures.  
      The rainfall in this area is     
 below the national average, and is    
 usually about 60cm.                   
      The prevailing wind is westerly, 
 and is usually light to moderate.     
      The area does not have a great   
 deal of snow, usually being affected  
 last in the country. Most roads are   
 kept open throughout the winter
