		<content> BEAVERS: Beavers is the group before  
 Cubs,  for boys aged 5-8. Cubs is the 
 next group in the Scout Association   
 for boys aged 8-11.  Each group of    
 Beavers is called a colony and the    
 boys are divided into sub-groups      
 called lodges.  They play games, draw,
 paint, make things and cook.
