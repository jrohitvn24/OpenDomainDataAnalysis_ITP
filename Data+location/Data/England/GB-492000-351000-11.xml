		<title>11BY=PASS ROAD LEADENHAM</title>
		<content> A by-pass for Leadenham was first     
 proposed in the 1930's.Since then     
 several schemes have been put forward,
 all of which have failed to           
 materialise, usually for economic     
 reasons. In 1973 a route was adopted  
 and by 1976 compulsory purchase orders
 had been published.This scheme was    
 also abandoned for economic reasons.In
 1984 the Dept.of Transport proposed a 
 Relief Road Scheme which cut the      
 village in half.A petition signed by  
 90% of the familiesliving in          
 Leadenham has been sent to the        
 Government pressing for a full by-pass
 and an early  completion.In summer    
 1985 the Dept.of Transport approved a 
 full by-pass originally planned in    
 1973 with  work scheduled to start in 
 1987 or later. The Parish Council is  
 currently pressing for a speedier     
 completion of the project.            </content>
