		<content>{ Copford}is a peaceful village to live
 in tucked away from the A12 main      
 artery but we are reminded of its     
 proximity to London and the seaside by
 the ever constant rumble of the trains
 with disturb the busy hum of bees and 
 insect life and the happy twittering  
 of our summer visitors, the swallows. 
{Real people}from all corners of the   
 country live and work here and some   
 disappear to the city during the      
 daylight hours.                       
  Copford is gradually being{invaded}by
 people with "foreign" accents and the 
 traditional old{Essex dialect}will    
 eventually vanish.  Perhaps that old  
 boy sitting in the corner there was   
 right after all -                     
{ "You'll never dew any good by gooin' 
{  a gallivantin'orf tew an owd orfis  
{  in London in a pair o'ankle-jacks   
{  and never dewin' a stroke o'wuk".   </content>
