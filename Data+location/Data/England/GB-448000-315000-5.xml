		<title>05WATER IN LOUGHBOROUGH</title>
		<content>  The water in our area consists of the
 streams,ponds,a reservoir,springs,    
 wells and a disused canal.This is the 
 water we can see.The other water in   
 our area is either stored in the soil 
 or moves in pipes under the fields and
 roads.Much of the water in the streams
 drains from the high ground of        
 Charnwood Forest.The most important   
 brook is called Wood Brook.Three      
 brooks Burleigh,Pocket Gate and Wood  
 Brook are tributaries of the River    
 Soar.Shortcliff Brook flows into the  
 quarry and another brook flows into   
 Blackbrook Reservoir.Six ponds are    
 provided by farmers for animals       
 drinking water.Nanpantan Reservoir is 
 filled with water from Blackbrook     
 Reservoir and sometimes from Wood     
 Brook.There is also a disused canal,  
 two wells and two springs.The water   
 from our taps comes from the R.Dove.  </content>
