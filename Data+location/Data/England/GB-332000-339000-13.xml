		<title>13Life in Erbistock, 1953</title>
		<content> Erbistock is a rural area,the majority
 of people were engaged in agriculture.
 The parish was dominated by Erbistock 
 and Manley Hall.The majority of houses
 were cottages tied to the estates.    
 There were no council houses.Services 
 were few. There was no electricity and
 no piped water.Water was obtained from
 a tap fed by a well.When the well ran 
 dry, water was collected from the     
 River Dee.Most people used an open    
 cooking range.Most people worked on   
 the estates which supported craftsmen 
 like hedgers and wheelwrights, as well
 as the usual farming jobs.Bicycles    
 were popular as there were few cars.  
 Many people went to Wrexham by bus for
 shopping.Mobile shops and a paraffin  
 seller came weekly.Sunday church      
 attendance was more or less compulsory
 due to the dependence of the community
 on the local gentry.                  </content>
