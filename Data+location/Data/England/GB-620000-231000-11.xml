		<title>11POND HALL FARM</title>
		<content> We visited{Pond Hall Farm}because it  
 is a good example of the type of      
{farming}that goes on in this area.    
 Most of the farms are small, and are  
 mainly concerned with{arable}farming. 
  Mrs. Bellingham rents the farm and   
 she told us that most of the land was 
 used for growing a variety of{cereal  
 and grain crops. These are the most   
 important source of money for the     
 farmers in this part of Essex, she    
 told us. However she also told us that
 some of the farmers keep{chickens}in  
 battery coops, but the only animals   
 which she kept were a few free range  
 hens and some geese.                  
  The major land cover of the area,    
 apart from the River Stour, is        
 farmland, and most of that is under   
 cereal crops,for Suffolk, like Essex, 
 is a big cereal growing county.
