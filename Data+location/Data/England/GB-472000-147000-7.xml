		<content> THERE ARE ONLY  2 CHURCHES IN OUR     
 AREA.THERE ARE THREE CHURCHES         
 THAT BELONG TO TO THE ROYAL AIR FORCE 
 STATION AT ODIHAM,BUT THEY ARE        
 MAINLY FOR THE PERSONNEL AND FAMILIES 
 WHO LIVE IN THE STATION MARRIED       
 QUARTERS.  APART FROM THESE MILITARY  
 CHURCHES, THERE ARE TWO OTHER CHURCHES
 IN OUR BLOCK, BOTH ANGLICAN, ONE EACH 
 IN THE VILLAGES OF LONG SUTTON AND    
 SOUTH WARNBOROUGH.  THE LOCAL PRIEST  
 TOLD US THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE CAME TO  
 THESE VILLAGE CHURCHES ON A NORMAL    
 SUNDAY, ONLY ABOUT 5% OF TE LOCAL     
 POPULATION USUALLY, BUT ON SPECIAL    
 OCCASIONS SUCH AS MOTHERING SUNDAY,   
 HARVEST FESTIVAL, EASTER AND          
 CHRISTMAS, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN    
 CHURCH INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
