		<content> THIS AREA IS TO THE NORTH -WEST OF    
 BIRMINGHAM ON THE OLD BOUNDARY OF     
 SUTTON COLDFIELD,WHICH WAS ONCE A     
 ROYAL BOROUGH.THE AREA                
 ,THEREFORE,DIVIDES UP INTO DISTINCT   
 HOUSING TYPES ARRANGED AROUND THE ONCE
 ROYAL FOREST OF SUTTON PARK,A NATURAL 
 WOODLAND AND HEATH AREA USED BY MANY  
 PEOPLE IN THE AREA AS A PLACE OF      
 RECREATION.ON THE NORTHERN EDGE ARE   
 THE LARGE DETATCHED HOUSES OF THE     
 SUTTON PEOPLE,A VERY MIDDLE CLASS     
 AREA.TO THE SOUTH OF THE REGION IS A  
 LARGE AREA OF COUNCIL OWNED PROPERTIES
 , WHILST IN THE MIDDLE ARE MOSTLY     
 SEMI-DETACHED HOUSES WHICH ARE OWNER  
 OCCUPIED                              
 THERE IS VERY LITTLE INDUSTRY IN THE  
 AREA,PEOPLE EITHER TRAVEL TO WORK OR  
 ARE INVOLVED IN THE SERVICE           
 INDUSTRIES.
