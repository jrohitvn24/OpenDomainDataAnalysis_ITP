		<title>08New residents in Oakley</title>
		<content>Most people that we talked to came to  
Oakley because they wanted to live in a
village .Everybody likes Oakley because
it is small and friendly .When asked   
what they did not like about Oakley    
many new residents said "nothing". Two 
people did not like the lack of buses. 
Most people had lived in bigger places 
before ,and said that Oakley was       
quieter and friendlier than their old  
residence .Half of the people have been
here less than three months .Most      
people have one or two children ,and   
most children that are old enough ,go  
to Oakley School ,they all have cars   
and use them more than they used       
to.One has an allotment ,a lot of      
people say they would like more        
actvities.
