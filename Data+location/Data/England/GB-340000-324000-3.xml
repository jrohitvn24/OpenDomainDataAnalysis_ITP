		<content> The first school was founded in 1836  
 with money provided under the 1709    
 will of Miss Eleanor Harris of        
 Boreatton Hall, Baschurch.   It is now
 a private house.   The present school 
 was built by the Harris Trust at      
 Weston Common in the 1870'S.   It was 
 enlarged in l894 to accommodate 70    
 children and 2 teachers.   The school 
 now has 33 children with 2 teachers.  
 The Harris Trust still helps the      
 school with the purchase of large     
 items of equipment.   Children go on  
 to the Corbet Comprehensive School,   
 Baschurch at the age of 11.   There is
 an active Sports Association of       
 neighbouring primary schools with whom
 the children compete in Football,     
 Rounders, Unihoc, Athletics, Swimming,
 Netball, Cross-country, Cricket.
