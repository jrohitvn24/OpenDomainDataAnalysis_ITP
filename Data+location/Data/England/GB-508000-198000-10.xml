		<title>10Abbots Langley life.</title>
		<content>We went to see Mr Flanagan to interview
him. He lives in Abbots Langley and    
used to teach at Holy Rood school. He  
has lived there for over 30 years. He  
told us that the land had belonged to  
an Abbot and was the birthplace of the 
only English Pope.  It is a large      
village and is surrounded by open land.
There are a few factories and some     
farms. Most of the population go to    
work in Watford or London. There is a  
peaceful feeling in the place. It is a 
friendly community still and many      
young people know each other. There    
are quite a few retired people about.  
There are amenities for young and old  
but some people don't bother going. It 
is a pleasant place to live in but     
things are changing as the new M25     
 Motorway being built nearby and this  
has brought more traffic and noise.
