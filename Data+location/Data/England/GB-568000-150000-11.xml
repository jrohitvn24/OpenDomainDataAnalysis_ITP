 The area is policed from Maidstone,   
 although a constable and his family   
 live in a police house at Yalding. The
 constable's duties extend to Maidstone
 and local villages, often on          
 motorcycle patrol. During the 1984/85 
 miners' strike he helped police       
 pickets in the Midlands and Kent      
 coalfields. Two areas cause local     
 concern, the activities of some local 
 youths and the behaviour of some      
 casual labourers. Seasonal work with  
 fruit and hops has traditionally seen 
 labour employed from outside the      
 village, some of the workers being    
 itinerants termed "travellers". On    
 some summer Saturday evenings double  
 police patrols have sometimes been    
 provided. This summer farmers are     
 encouraging more local people to help 
 with fruit picking.                   </content>
