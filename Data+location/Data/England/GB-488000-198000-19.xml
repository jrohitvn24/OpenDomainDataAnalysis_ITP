		<title>19   Haleacre Workshops</title>
		<content>   Haleacre Workshops are a number of  
 units hired out to people. The units  
 themselves are old farm buildings.The 
 actual crafts are very different.Two  
 of the most interesting were the glass
 blower and the Inventor.              
   Rather than one big business there  
 are lots of little businesses.This is 
 a list of the kind of work done there:
 special effects,market stalls,store   
 rooms,furniture makers,restoration and
 re-upholstery work.                   
   Most people have been working there 
 for three years.Some of the things    
 they do are very interesting.The most 
 common business is upholstery.It is   
 all owned by one man.The units are    
 dotted all over the place.The system  
 of numbering is worked out by when the
 units came into use.There are about   
 forty units and one office.Most people
 would move if they had enough money.  </content>
