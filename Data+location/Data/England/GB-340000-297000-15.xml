		<title>15WELSH SHEEP</title>
		<content>{Mr Coleman}has{400}Welsh sheep.They   
 are small sheep that can survive on   
 the cold hills.He doesn't keep the    
 larger{Suffolk sheep}because they     
 don't thrive very well on the         
 hills.When he takes the Welsh lambs to
 market,he only gets{Â£8}each for       
 them.If he had Suffolk sheep,he would 
 get{Â£30}each.Welsh sheep have kemp in 
 their fleece.Kemp is little pieces of 
 dead  wool.Mr Coleman doesn't get much
 money for the Welsh sheep's{fleeces   
 because the{kemp}can't be dyed        
 properly,so it is only used for making
 carpets or felt.
