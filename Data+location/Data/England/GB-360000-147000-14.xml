		<title>14RECREATION FACILITIES</title>
		<content> Until recently the children of Binegar
 and G.S. did not have a recreation    
 ground so villagers combined to raise 
 the money to create one in the middle 
 of the village. The reward for their  
 hard labour was to win a prize in a   
 national competition for the project. 
 Oakhill has its own recreation field  
 and at the moment villagers are       
 raising money for, and building, their
 own village hall upon it. Oakhill     
 House restaurent was started 4 yrs.   
 ago in a large house in the centre of 
 the village and aims to provide fine  
 food in pleasant surroundings. Mendip 
 Gof Club also have their course within
 our quadrant which consists of a nine 
 hole golf course and the club house   
 near Maesbury castle. Binegar has its 
 own village hall and hold various     
 entertainments there including a      
 Christmas pantomime.                  </content>
