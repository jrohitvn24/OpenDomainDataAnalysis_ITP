		<content> Hop Growing (continued)               
 The short term outlook looks          
 disastrous unless an immediate        
 solution is found.One answer could be 
 to lower the height of hop plants to  
 allow for easier access,or to make use
 of a hop picking machine which may    
 create a competitive advantage.       
  Two local advantages are in our      
 favour.1. U.K. farmers are much larger
 than the European average (200 ha. as 
 compared with 5-50 ha.).2. Most local 
 farmers have a high social standing   
 and a great deal of capital is locked 
 up in the farms.                      
  The overall result has been a        
 decrease in acreage by some 27% in the
 area surveyed since 1970,with a recent
 acceleration in the trend.Most of the 
 land has been converted to cereals and
 root crops.
