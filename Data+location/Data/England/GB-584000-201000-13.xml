		<title>13HISTORIC MOUND ,PURLEIGH</title>
		<content> There is an{historic}mound in{Purleigh
 which is covered with bushes,trees and
 lots of stinging nettles. It is       
 thought to be part of a late{11th     
{century Motte and Bailey Castle.      
   The owner of the land has found some
{pottery dated from that period},and   
 also some{oyster shells},which suggest
 that a person of some wealth lived on 
 this site.The amount of{stinging      
{nettles}also suggest people lived     
 there.                                
    {The Motte,}or mound,has{a moat}and
 there are the{remains of ramparts.    
    It was an excellent site to build a
 wooden keep,as they would have been   
 able to see for miles.
