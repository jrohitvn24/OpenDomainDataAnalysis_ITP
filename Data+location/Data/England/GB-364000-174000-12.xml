		<content>   The{Observer Newspaper}is a free    
 paper which is delivered to every     
 house in the Kingswood district. The  
 paper was first issued in{1886}but    
 there have only been free editions for
 the last 10 years. Its{circulation}is 
 approximtely{15,000.}The production   
 costs are met by local firms'         
 advertising. The team of reporters    
 live out of the area so that they can 
 be objective in their reports of local
 events. The paper carries stories     
 about{local events and issues.}Over   
 the last year (1984), two of the      
 major stories have been the new{Avon  
{Ring Road}which will pass through the 
 area, and the opening of the{Cycle    
 Track which now links Bristol with    
 Bath.{Unemployment,}and the           
 possibility of providing new{leisure  
{facilities,}have also been highlighted
 as important local issues.            </content>
