		<content>A typical school year.                 
At the first school we work on         
different topics during the year, the  
first topic we did was on Harvest.Our  
next one was entitled {Transport}, we  
went to the London {Transport} {Museum}
and had a nice time there.In the New   
Year we looked at Birds, we had 18     
eggs but only 4 hatched.We like doing  
topics because we go on outings and    
make models.It is more interesting to  
see and do things than just sit in the 
classroom.                             
In the Middle School we do individual  
as well as subject topics. Our         
timetable is quite formal we do Maths  
and English most mornings.We have      
regular assemblies.We cover all subject
areas but sometimes change teachers.We 
have 4 houses and are awarded team     
points for good work etc.We also lose  
them sometimes.                        </content>
