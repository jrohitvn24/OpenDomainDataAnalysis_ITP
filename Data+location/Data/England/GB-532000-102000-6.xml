		<title>06ST.DUNSTANS HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>       St. Dunstans hospital was       
 founded in 1915 by Sir Arthur Pearson,
 his objective being to establish a    
{rehabilitation centre}for men{blinded 
 in World War 1. The original situation
 in Regents Park, London, was very     
 successful but there was an           
 overflow; thus in 1930 with the threat
 of another war looming an annexe was  
 built in{Ovingdean.}                  
       Ian Fraser house is a six storey
 building on high ground overlooking   
 the sea. The floor plans are all      
 identical, with many guide rails,     
 creating an ideal habitat for the     
 blind occupants. The general          
 facilities are varied and plentiful   
 and include workshops, bowling rinks, 
 gymnasium, swimming pool and even     
 archery on the lawns. The main task is
 for the staff to develop the patients'
 skills to get them back into society. </content>
