		<title>05Family Weekend in Ponteland</title>
		<content> The average number of people in a     
 family living in the same house is 4. 
{Saturday.}The majority of families    
 seem to go out on Saturday.They mostly
 go out together maybe by car to a     
 local town such as Morpeth or the city
 of Newcastle upon Tyne where they will
 do some shopping.                     
 Others will do domestic jobs in the   
 house or tidy up the garden.This may  
 involve cleaning with the help of an  
 electric cleaner or washing the       
 clothes using a washing machine.There 
 will also be cooking and baking for   
 the family to do.In the afternoon     
 relations may be visited or some      
 public event such as a farm or dog    
 Show where the animals are taken and  
 shown off to the judges who will award
 points for breeding quality,behaviour 
 and grooming.In the evening parents go
 out to friends,a pub,or a restaurant. </content>
