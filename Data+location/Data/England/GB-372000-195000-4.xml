		<title>04Landscape in Nibley</title>
		<content> This area of landscape covers part of 
 Cotswold Edge, with scarp slopes and  
 deep valleys leading to the flat open 
 Severn Vale. The majority of the land 
 is rural with a few farms which are   
 situated at the bottom of the valleys.
 This includes the south west section  
 of Dursley and all of North Nibley. In
 Woodmancote there are many buildings  
 of historic interest. Several date    
 back to the 17th century. Nibley House
 is one of these. The house was        
 remodelled and a new front added in   
 1763. The house is listed  and the    
 main attraction is the grand 18th     
 century staircase. Stancombe Park is  
 another listed house. Parts of the    
 house date from 1780 and others from  
 1850. There are approximately 20      
 rooms. THe house has 150 acres        
 surrounding it and is owned by Mr.    
 Barlow.                               </content>
