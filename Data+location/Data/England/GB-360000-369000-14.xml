 The Abbey's grounds are approximately 
 33 acres.  In the middle of the land  
 there is a large pond with an         
 abundance of fish and other wildlife. 
 In the centre of this, there is a     
 fountain.  Also in the garden there is
 a monument which marks the grave of a 
 nun - Ida - and it is thought to mark 
 the high altar of the church that     
 Edward 1 built.  There is a helicopter
 pad and in the future, tennis courts  
 and a swimming pool are going to be   
 constructed.                          
 [Ida]                                 
 Ida was in love with Father John.     
 They ran away together because they   
 could not marry.  As punishment she   
 was sent to a nunnery in Chester and  
 with her consent John became Abbot    
 Peter.  When she died she was buried  
 in the grounds.                       </content>
