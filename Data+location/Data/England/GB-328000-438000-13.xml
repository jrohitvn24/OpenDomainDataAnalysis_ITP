		<title>13HANDBELL RINGERS</title>
		<content>                                       
 St. Stephen-on-the-Cliffs church has a
 very active team of handbell ringers. 
 Many of the ringers have been girls   
 from our school, and the present      
 leader is an old girl. At first, when 
 the parish had only a hall and no     
 money for a church, some of the       
 congregation bought the handbells and 
 the choir went round the local hotels 
 and public houses, playing tunes on   
 the bells to raise money. In the early
 days of the ringers, they began on    
 Christmas Day lunchtime at Uncle Tom's
 Cabin (mentioned on another of our    
 pages.)Later on , the vicar and the   
 curate took along the Youth Club too, 
 and money was collected for           
 missionaries. The handbell ringers    
 always play in church on Christmas    
 Eve, just before Midnight Mass.
