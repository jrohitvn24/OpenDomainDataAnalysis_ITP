		<title>13 Parker's Patch</title>
		<content>                                       
 Parker's Patch is the name of my      
house. It's got three bedrooms and two 
loos with 13 windows and an ancient    
fire place that was there at the time  
of Roland Parker who was the Head      
Master in the village school in 1875.  
He was also the choirmaster and        
organist of the parish. The house is   
about 20 steps up from the school and  
10 steps down from the Post Office     
which is owned by Mr. Rutterford. We   
moved into the house in December 1984. 
There are 4 rooms down stairs and 5    
rooms up stairs. In the garden there's 
a fishpond and a green house. In the   
kitchen there's a toaster, a washing   
machine, a tumble drier and a fridge   
with floor and wall cupboards along    
the sides. I live there with my mummy, 
Alastair and Elizabeth.
