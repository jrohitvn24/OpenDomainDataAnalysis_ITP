		<title>12My Life Today.9 years</title>
		<content>It is a nice life here in Harpsden in  
1985.Every day we go to School to learn
things.We have been going out in the   
minibus,which we share with two other  
Schools,and in cars to visit the Area  
for our Domesday Project.We are also   
making a Book on the Middle Ages for   
Tudor 500.We have visited Henley to see
a tenth scale working section of a     
Greek Trireme.We all had a go at moving
the heavy oars.We drew pictures and met
the Designer who is sending the boat to
Greece.I like eating fish and chips and
riding around on my bike.I have a pet  
dog called Meg and a mouse called      
Smudge.Every morning and evening I walk
the dog and Mum does too.We moved here 
recently from a smaller School in      
Derbyshire.My sister,Anna,has two cats 
and she will be going to the Secondary 
School in September.My house is next to
the School.It was once a laundry.      </content>
