   Aslackby itself does not have any   
 emergency services, and its residents 
 have to travel to surrounding villages
 or towns to get help. The nearest     
 police service is at Billingborough as
 is the doctor.There is another doctor 
 at Corby Glen, 9 miles away, and a    
 surgery of his at Rippingale.

   Aslackby school became a private    
 house when it closed around 1965. Many
 older people of the village remember  
 attending the school. The grounds     
 still remain, with the playground now 
 being a large garden.                 
   The primary children are now bussed 
 to Pointon C.of E., 3 miles away,     
 while the secondary pupils are either 
 sent to the Aveland School in         
 Billingborough, or Bourne Grammar,7   
 miles away.                           </content>
