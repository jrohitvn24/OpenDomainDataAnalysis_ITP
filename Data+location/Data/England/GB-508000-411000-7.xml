		<content> On 3 May 1983 the Kirmington &amp; Croxton
 Women's Institute was formed by a V.C.
 O.of Humberside Federation.This first 
 meeting was attended by 22 women.     
 Membership of the Kirmington &amp; Croxton
 W.I.is open to all women over 16,sub- 
 scription 1985/86 Â£4.In our 3rd year  
 the membership is 18,mostly married   
 women in their 20's or 30's.Approxima-
 tly half the women living in K. &amp; C.  
 have attended at least one of our     
 meetings since formation less than 3  
 years ago.We meet on the first Tuesday
 each month in the village hall.Topics 
 range from Embroidery to First Aid,and
 Cookery to Local History.Each year we 
 run one evening outing and one open   
 meeting, the latter open to members of
 the public, men included at no cost.  
 2 squares of the Domesday project have
 been done by a group of members in the
 summer of 1985.This one &amp; Melton Ross.</content>
