The school is hidden behind the old    
school house at 61 High Street.  It was
completed in 1820 in stone by local    
people.  Recent additions are in brick 
with slate roofs.  There are two       
classrooms.  In July 1985 there were 44
pupils comprising 25 juniors aged 7-11 
years and 19 infants aged 4-7 years.   
There are 5 teachers 2 of whom are     
full-time, a secretary, a lunch-time   
supervisor and a cleaner.  All pupils  
go weekly to Towcester for swimming.   
Pupils perform an annual Nativity Play 
and present an end of school year      
concert.  There is a trip to the       
theatre every year and in the summer a 
school camp.  Friends of the school    
raise money to supply valuable extras, 
including printer and disc-drive for   
the RML480Z computer, overhead         
projector, games equipment.            </content>
