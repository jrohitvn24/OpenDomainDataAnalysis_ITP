		<title>03CLUB DAY,THE FAIR,SHRIMPING.</title>
		<content>   {Lytham Pier}was constructed in 1861
 at a cost of{Â£6,000.}It was 914 feet  
 in length.In 1960 it was decided tha  
 it wae a danger to the public and     
 should be demolished.A fighting       
 committee tried desperately to keep   
 the pier.However, in March 1960       
 demolition work commenced.Much of the 
 timber was used locally for firewood. 
   Lytham used to be famous for{       
{shrimping}now it is not.Recently there
 has been a campaign to clean up the   
 sea to attract more shrimps back.     
   In the 19th Century families all got
 together after a catch and they       
 shelled,boiled and potted them in     
 butter.Once there were few shrimps    
 caught for 2 years and it was thought 
 that they had gone for good.However,  
 catches are now on the increase and   
 7 boats are now working out of Lytham.
