		<title>13Southampton's River Test 2</title>
		<content>    We spent a sunny day at{Lower Test 
{Valley Nature Reserve}. Here are some 
 of our observations and comments.     
      {****  RIVER TEST  ****          
  "I went looking for river creatures  
 and caught a few{flat fish}and{       
{ragworms}."                           
  "In the river I saw two pieces of    
 china, bricks, glass, tins, paper, a  
 rusty old bike. I also saw ripples."  
  "I caught loads of{shrimps}. They    
 were white and you could see inside." 
      {****  THE SALT MARSH  ****      
  "I found a dead{rabbit}. It was white
 and had{flies}on it. I think a{fox}may
 have killed it because it was eaten." 
  "We encountered a huge bog with great
 big grass almost as tall as me. I was 
 lucky - I had my wellies on!"         
  "I came out of the river, my legs    
 covered in mud, like black boots. It's
 a brilliant place to come and play!"  </content>
