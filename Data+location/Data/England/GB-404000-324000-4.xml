		<title>04BAGOTS BROMLEY FARM</title>
		<content> On Thursday we went to{BAGOTS BROMLEY 
 farm and we came to a big shed and we 
 went into the shed and we saw some    
 pigs. Then we went to see some piglets
 and there were 40 piglets. Then we    
 went across some fields and had a look
 at a monument and the farmer said that
 Lord Bagot had lived in the field that
 we were standing in. Then we went to  
 have a look at a moat and the farmer  
 said it was used for keeping the deer 
 out and then we went back to school.
