		<content>Only one main road - the A43 - passes  
through the study area....a busy route 
between Kettering/Corby and Stamford.  
A traffic count 21 June 1985 recorded  
58 cars,22 lorries,11 vans,5 coaches,  
1 service bus, and 2 motor/cycles in a 
fifteen minute period.(12.00-12.15)    
On the same day similar counts were    
taken at Deene.....(14.05-14.20) when  
3 cars,a tractor and a van were        
recorded, and at Deenethorpe..(15.00-  
15.15) with 2 cars being counted.      
                                       
There are no bus services through the  
two villages, and traffic on the minor 
roads in the locality was light. Only  
the A43 possessed a steady flow of     
vehicles, few of which were destined   
for the immediate area.
