		<title>11ASHDOWN FOREST FOOTPATHS</title>
		<content>   The Parish of Hartfield of which    
 this area is a part has 43 miles of   
 footpaths.                            
   A sub-committee of the Parish       
 Council meets 6 times a year to keep a
 check that these paths are kept open. 
 The bridleways and footpaths on       
 Ashdown Forest are especially well cut
 and marked by the Rangers and the     
 Ramblers Association help in keeping  
 the others clear.  The majority of the
 footpaths are through undulating      
 farmland and small woods, many with   
 fine views.                           
   The disused railway line from       
 Groombridge to Forest Row was opened  
 in 1977 as a Linear Park, very popular
 with walkers.  In the last few years  
 the banks have many more trees and    
 bushes growing on them with wild      
 flowers in abundance. There is also a 
 footpath which crosses Pooh Bridge.   </content>
