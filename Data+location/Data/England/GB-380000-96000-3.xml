		<content> However,during the war,paraffin wax   
 containers were no longer available   
 and so cartoning stopped.In 1941 the  
 factory was acquired by Independant   
 Milk Supplies and was soon            
 specialising in cheddar cheese        
 production.About 40,000lbs of cheese  
 was produced each day together with   
 some whey butter.                     
       The Express Dairy Company took  
 over the factory in 1959 and continued
 to produce cheese until 1975.That     
 year the Salad Production Department  
 at Ruislip was transferred to Milborne
 and cheese production                 
 ended.However,milk is still handled at
 Milborne.It is collected each day     
 from 126 farms and sent by tanker to  
 London for bottling.
