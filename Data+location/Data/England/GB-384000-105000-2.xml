		<content>   The main building was the country   
 residence of Lord Portman,built in the
 1890's. The architect was Norman Shaw;
 he based his design on Menars,a Loire 
 chateau.The original house remains as 
 it was, despite a major change of use.
   Around it have been added labs, the 
 Coade Hall,the Greek theatre,the Music
 school,a classroom block &amp; residential
 buildings. The stables were converted 
 first to science labs, next housing   
 for boys,then separate boys' &amp; girls' 
 houses and finally a girls' house.The 
 main house,first designed for 2, now  
 sleeps over 300 boys,feeds 600 or more
 &amp; accommodates all the administration 
 &amp; much of the classwork of the school.
   The main building is adaptable but  
 structural change is difficult:4 weeks
 were needed recently to make a new    
 doorway because of the thickness of   
 the internal walls.                   </content>
