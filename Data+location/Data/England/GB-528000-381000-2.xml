 rape. Other residents commute to      
 neighbouring towns. Some houses have  
 recently been built in Tathwell and   
 Withcall, but due to the intensive    
 nature of farming in the area it is   
 unlikely that much land will be used  
 for residential purposes. The farming 
 methods employed,involving substantial
 use of chemicals, have had a          
 significant effect on wildlife        
 reducing the numbers of wild flowers  
 drastically, and removing much of the 
 habitat of small mammals, although    
 hares and rabbits are still quite     
 numerous. The presence of barn owls   
 indicates that small rodents such as  
 shrews and mice still exist in the    
 area. Although not very high, this    
 area is exposed to the winds from the 
 North sea, and can be very bleak even 
 in the summer.                        </content>
