=19.Most stallholders lived locally &amp;  
had been coming to the Market for more 
than 5 yrs.The greatest change that    
they had noticed in the past few years 
was that their customers bought less &amp; 
were far more 'choosy' as they had     
less money to spend.Most complained    
that the Market area was not large     
enough. They would like to see more    
stalls provided.Customers lived locally
&amp; travelled by  car,on foot &amp; by bike. 
They thought that the Market provided  
good value for money &amp; came regularly. 
The most popular buy was Fruit &amp; Veg.
