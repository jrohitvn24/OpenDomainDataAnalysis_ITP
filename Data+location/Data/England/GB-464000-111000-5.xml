		<title>05Denmead's Church's History.</title>
		<content>  All Saints Church was built because  
 the 600 people of Barn Green did not  
 want to travel, any longer, the       
 distance to the Church in Hambledon.  
 It became Denmead's Church because    
 Barn Green was, in 1880, only apart of
 the Tithing of Denmead. Barn Green has
 since been lost under shops.          
  The land for the Church was given by 
 William Griffin and the cost of the   
 building born by several local        
 landowners. Denmead became a seperate 
 Parish in 1881 but did not gain a     
 cemetary until 1917.                  
  A Parish Council first met in 1920   
 replacing the Vestry Council. A Church
 Hall was built in 1966. There have    
 been 7 Vicars since 1880 the latest of
 whom is The Revd. J.R.Herklots M.A..
