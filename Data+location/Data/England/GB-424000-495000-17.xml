		<content>{Killerby Hall}is situated to the south
 of Catterick Village and to the       
 eastern side of the A1.               
 Killerby Hall is an impressive country
 house facing south over parkland.The  
 house was formerly a hunting lodge and
 therefore unoccupied for most of the  
 year.The present building was         
 completed in 1906 for the Moubray     
 family,who owned collieries near      
 Glasgow.                              
 The present owner,who lives in the    
 hall with his family,is a "working    
 farmer"and farms 600 acres around     
 Killerby Hall.The family have a second
 farm of 300 acres across the River    
 Swale,which is farmed by a brother.   
 Together the brothers employ two full 
 time skilled farm workers .           
 Killerby Hall is chiefly an arable    
 farm and the main crops are cereals.
