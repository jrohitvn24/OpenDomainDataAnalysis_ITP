{Some older residents feel}that the    
 village is not as good as when they   
 were children because in those days it
 was a community village. Many         
 villagers were related to one another 
 as families seemed to stay in the same
 area as the one they were born in.    
{But now, more new people}are moving in
 and some older residents believe that 
 it has become less of a community.    
 Instead it is more like a commuter    
 village for people who work in Yate   
 and the Bristol area.                 
{However, living standards}are much    
 higher.
