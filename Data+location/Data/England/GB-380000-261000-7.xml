		<content> Due to mechanisation little manpower  
 is needed in the farming industry and 
 one man can cope with one hundred     
 acres with some casual labour help.   
 The major employer is a sand and      
 gravel quarrying firm where 30 people 
 work. Nine people are engaged in the  
 packaging of bows and arrows which are
 made in Astley. This industry thrives 
 due to the increase in{TOXOPHILITES.} 
 Some jobs are created by three shops, 
 three public houses and a petrol      
 filling/service station. Most         
 residents commute to the surrounding  
  cities and towns to work by means of 
 a private car.
