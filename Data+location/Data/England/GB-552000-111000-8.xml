		<content>   A hamster called Earthquake not     
surprizingly won the prize for the pet 
with the most unusual name in the pet  
show at the Chiddingly school fayre.   
 Flake the lamb was another pet which  
raised 400 pounds for school funds.    
   The unseasonal weather did not deter
300 people from enjoying such          
attractions as strawberries and cream, 
musical rides and side shows. There was
also entertainment from the East       
Sussex Youth Concert Band. The most    
popular event was the BMX competition  
on a specially built track. A young man
of 16 years won the Chris Pelling      
Trophy for the Â£Grand Canyon Jump'.    
   Also school pupils gave displays of 
almost long forgotten traditional      
dances such as the Barber's Pole and   
the Spider's Web !
