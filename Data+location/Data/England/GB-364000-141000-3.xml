		<content> Southill House is a{Georgian house}in 
{Cranmore,}built of{Doulting stone.}It 
 is thought that the house was built   
 for the{Strode}family who then owned  
 most of{Cranmore,}then known as       
{Strode.}Around 1890 it was sold to the
 Spencers together with 6 farms and    
 20,000 acres for Â£30,000. The house   
 has about 50 rooms.Many of the        
 cupboards are as big as a modern      
 bedroom.Under the house flows a       
 stream. There is a large cellar split 
 into small rooms,one of which is used 
 as a wine store.At the foot of the    
 stairs still hangs a portrait of Mrs. 
{Chetham Strode}the first lady of the  
 house. She had no children and died at
 only 30.After the death of her        
 husband, Mr{Chetham Strode}the house  
 was handed down to his brother Mr     
{Chetham,}who then changed his name to 
{Chetham Strode.                       </content>
