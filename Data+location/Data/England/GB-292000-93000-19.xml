		<title>19The Bombing of Beacon Downe.</title>
		<content>    Some pupils from St James High     
 School came across an amazing story of
 the Second World War in a very        
 unexpected place while doing their    
 amenities survey.The owner of{Beacon  
{Downe (955952)}Field Marshal Sir      
 Richard Hull K.G. G.C.B. D.S.O. kindly
 allowed us an interview and this is   
 what we discovered:                   
   On St.George's Day 1942 at 11p.m.   
 two 1000 pound bombs were jettisoned  
 by a German bomber which had decided  
 to return to base rather than continue
 in a raid on Bristol.One bomb exploded
 a few yards from the house and the    
 other in the kitchen garden.The       
 gardener's cottage and conservatory   
 were destroyed,there was considerable 
 damage to the stable block and the    
 house was declared irreparable.Despite
 the damage 14 people survived.
