		<title>12 RAMSDEN SLAUGTER HOUSE</title>
		<content>  The slaugter house has only four     
 employees, induding the owner. The    
 business has been in the family for   
 many years,the present owner only     
 recently taking over from his father  
 who has retired.                      
  The four men start work at 7.00      
 and continue until 5.00 from          
 Monday to Friday. Sometimes they even 
 have to work on a Saturday morning,   
 despite only being able to get about  
 twenty animals a week.                
  They use a captive bolt pistol to    
 kill the cows and an electric gun to  
 kill pigs,sheep and goats. Not only   
 do they kill the animals but they     
 treat the pork ,beef and other        
 meats before sending it to the        
 butchers.                             
  Every day animals are delivered and  
 meat is collected.
