		<content> Beavers:  On Monday evening I go tp   
 Beavers.  You can go to Beavers before
 you start Cubs.  We play games like   
 crab-football.  Crab-football is      
 football but you stand on your hands  
 and feet.  We make things and         
 sometimes go on trips to places like  
 the zoo.                              
 Cubs:  In Cubs, we do all sorts of    
 things and we work for 'arrow badges' 
 and proficiency badges.  I enjoy Cubs 
 a lot, I am a Seconder of the 'black' 
 six.  On Saturday we are going to     
 camp.                                 
 Scouts:  Scouts is an activity for    
 boys over ten years old.  In Scouts   
 you learn how to tie special knots,   
 how to cook on open fires and to set  
 up tents.  There are a range of       
 courses to take part in and badges to 
 learn.                                
                                       </content>
