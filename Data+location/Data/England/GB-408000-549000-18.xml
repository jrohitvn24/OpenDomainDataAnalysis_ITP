		<content> Owing to a large influx of Irish      
 immigrants to help man the furnaces at
 the then newly founded Iron Company,  
 Consett has a thriving{Roman Catholic 
 community. A high percentage of these 
 people attend church on Sundays and   
 special days during the year. So      
 although Catholics form a minority of 
 the total population in the area  they
 are certainly the largest practising  
 religious group.{St.Patricks church   
 has two priests and laymen who carry  
 out duties such as visiting sick      
 people.                               
    The rest of the population have in 
 the main been baptised in the local   
 church of England or one of the       
 several Methodist chapels. The        
{Salvation Army}has a base in Consett  
 and has the distinction of having     
 formed the first{Salvation Army Band  
   Most people do not attend church.   </content>
