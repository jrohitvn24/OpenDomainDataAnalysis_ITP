		<content> The landscape of this area is covered 
 with fields, hedgerows and small      
 lanes. Badgers and foxes are the      
 largest mammals but rabbits, mice,    
 hedgehogs and voles are common. There 
 are several small lakes, ponds and    
 a number of streams that support a    
 wide variety of aquatic life from     
 frogs, newts and fish to water insects
 and water fowl. The most common local 
 birds are blackbirds, sparrows,       
 robins, thrushes and magpies. In the  
 wooded areas you can find woodpeckers 
 and owls.                             
 There are a lot of wild flowers that  
 grow along the road verges and        
 hedgerows. Although some of the old   
 hedgerows have been removed to aid    
 modern farming. Examples are fox      
 glove, cow parsley and bluebells. In  
 the autumn there are lots of fungi.
