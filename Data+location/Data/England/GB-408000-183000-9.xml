		<content> Lydiard Tregoze is named after{Robert 
{of Tregoze}who gained possession of   
 the estate and surrounding area during
 the 12th Century .                    
 In{1420}the land became property of   
 the{St.John family}who held it for the
 next 500 years until 1943 when Swindon
 Corporation bought the mansion and    
 park for the use of the people of the 
 area. The house, rebuilt in 1743 in   
 the{classical Palladian style}is open 
 to the public .                       
 A new{visitors centre}has been built  
 to help people enjoy the extensive    
 parkland providing information about  
 the varied park wildlife, refreshments
 and changing rooms for the adjacent   
 cricket and football pitches.
