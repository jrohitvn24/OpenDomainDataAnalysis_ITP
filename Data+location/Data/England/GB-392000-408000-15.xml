 You need 2 or more people and one     
 person has to be "on".The people who  
 aren't "on" stand about 10 metres away
 from whoever is "on".The person who is
 "on" turns her back on the other      
 people and shouts "M-I-L-K spells     
 Milk",then turns round.While the      
 person who is "on" is doing this,the  
 other people should be running up to  
 the person who is "on".But when she   
 turns round,the others must stand     
 still.If you move,you have to go back 
 to the start.Then the game carries on 
 until someone touches the person who  
 is "on".Then that person is "on".The  
 game carries "on" until everyone has  
 had a go at being "on".
