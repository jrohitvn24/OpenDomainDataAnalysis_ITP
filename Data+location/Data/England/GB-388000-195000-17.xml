		<content> There are few places reserved for{    
{RECREATION}in this block. But there   
 are people who live in the block who  
 go to the social{CLUB}to play skittles
 or who use the large recreation       
 ground. In a survey of peoples        
 sporting interests a number of people 
 said they play cricket at nearby      
 Cherington.                           
    There is half of a football pitch  
 in the block and a number of people   
 play golf at the nearby Minchinhampton
 Golf Course. Horse riding is quite    
 popular particularly with children and
 there is a good riding centre just out
 side the block.There are a number of  
 bridle paths which give scenic rides  
 through the Cotswold countryside.     
 The most popular{SPORTS}are           
 badminton, football and skittles.     
 There is a skittle alley at the "The  
 Cross Inn".                           </content>
