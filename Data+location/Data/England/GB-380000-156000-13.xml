		<title>13MOTO CROSS 500cc GRAND PRIX</title>
		<content> The {British Moto Cross Grand Prix}was
 staged on July 14 on a hillside in    
 Farleigh Hungerford . The sport was   
 once called scrambling but now has a  
 new name. Two races took place that   
 afternoon and each one was called a   
{"moto"}. 25,000 people came from all  
 over the world for the weekend and    
 many of them camped in the fields     
 nearby. The World Championship has 12 
 legs each in a different country. This
 was the 9th set of races. The event is
 popular with spectators and racers but
 the bumpy hillside makes a demanding  
 course. The track is 2 1/2 miles long 
 and each race lasts for 40 minutes    
 plus 2 laps. The winner gets 20 points
 towards the championship total. One   
 Briton and a Frenchman came first in a
 race each .There is racing twice a    
 year at Farleigh.
