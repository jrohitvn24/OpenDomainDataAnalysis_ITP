		<title>12The Four Parishes.</title>
		<content> Three parishes,Reepham,Hackford and   
 Whitwell all meet in the churchyard.  
 All three parishes are usually known  
 as Reepham.Reepham has a market place 
 so it is a town.Nearly all of the     
 shops and pubs are set around the     
 market place.Most people who live in  
 Reepham live within walking distance  
 of the market place.                  
 Some of what people call Reepham is in
 fact Hackford.The school and many of  
 the houses to the west of the market  
 are in  Hackford.The rest of Hackford 
 is farmland with Hackford Hall in the 
 middle.                               
 In Whitwell there is a river with a   
 mill and lots of grazing land near    
 Whitwell Hall.                        
 Booton is just a little way out of    
 Reepham.There is a Christmas pagent   
 in Booton Hall every year.It is about 
 one mile away from the town centre.   </content>
