      There are not  many  factories in
 our  area.  However at Greenhill there
 are seven on one site.There is a resin
 injection  factory that  also supplies
 moulds.  There are factories producing
 prefabricated piggeries and body parts
 for cars.  There is  a  scrap merchant
 who also supplies coal.A welder relies
 on local supplies for metals and makes
 and repairs articles such as gates and
 trailers,mainly for local farmers. The
 piggeries are made of  ply-wood, glass
 fibre and  asbestos.  The total number
 employed  by  all of the  factories is
 30.  The products are sold world-wide.
 At Albaston a firm  which used to make
 ice-cream moved into new premises  but
 after  a fire  are  now supplying from
 their old premises ice-cream purchased
 from the large manufacturers. Some new
 light industrial units are planned.   </content>
