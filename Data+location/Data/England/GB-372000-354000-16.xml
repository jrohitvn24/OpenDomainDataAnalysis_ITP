 Hazels" of which there was a profusion
 in the neighbourhood.                 
 In 1642 Dragoners stayed in Haslington
 on their way to relieve the siege of  
 Nantwich.                             
 In 1644 the body of a soldier was hung
 o the gallows on the heath and is said
 to haunt the area.                    
 The highwayman,Dick Turpin is said to 
 have stayed at the Hawk Inn for rest. 
 There is an annual flower show in the 
 village.                              
 There is a Service of Remembrance     
 every year for those who died in the  
 two World Wars held around the        
 cenotaph by the Yoxall Institute.
