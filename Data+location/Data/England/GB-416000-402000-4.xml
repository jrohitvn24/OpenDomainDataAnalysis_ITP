		<content> This registered workers collective    
 owns and occupies two rows of terraced
 houses. The {Commune}was set up in    
 1974 with a few couples and their     
 children which attracted quite a bit  
 of television coverage during their   
 first few years. The population of the
 group has varied and at the present   
 time there are 11 adults and 5        
 children who are involved with        
 childcare, domestic duties, gardening,
 building maintenance, craft workshops 
 and a printing business which is the  
 main source of income.                
 Their aims are to co-operatively,     
 develop new sorts of relationships and
 offer an alternative to the {nuclear  
{family.}Though isolated their members 
 are socially and politically active   
 and have an open invitation policy to 
 encourage growth for the future.
