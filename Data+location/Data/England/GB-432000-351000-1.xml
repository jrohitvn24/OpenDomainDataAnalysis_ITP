		<content> The designated region stretches from  
 Alderwasley in the north-west to      
 Ambergate in the south-east,including 
 the settlements of Fritchley,Crich and
 Bullbridge.The area is divided in half
 by the quadruple transport routes of  
 the River Derwent,the A6,the Matlock- 
 Derby railway line and the Cromford   
 Canal.The main residential area is the
 village of Fritchley,which is located 
 in East Derbyshire 3 miles north of   
 Belper.With a population of just over 
 600,the village derives its name from 
 Frychisleagh,which means "the meadows 
 where the fir trees stand."Fritchley  
 was once a small industrial centre    
 with such home industries as hat and  
 stocking making,spinning and weaving. 
 Other employment was provided at corn 
 mills,local lime quarries and         
 railroads,but more recently,Fritchley 
 has become a commuter village.        </content>
