		<title>02LANDSCAPE: The River Irwell</title>
		<content>   The Irwell is 300 million years     
 old it starts as a spring in a        
 hillside at Irwell farm on the A671   
 road.It is a fairly short river,only  
 39 miles in length.Until the 19th     
 century the fishing industry was      
 prosperous.The 19th century population
 and industry grew.Many factories      
 poured their waste products directly  
 into the river.All fish life was wiped
 out and because of the dreadful state 
 of the river the first river          
 prevention act was passed in 1876.    
 During the years the Irwell has       
 improved, mainly due to less trade    
 premises disposing of their waste into
 the river.There are also improvments  
 of the quality of the treated effluent
 effluents that leaves the sewage works
 Drinking water is not taken from The  
  Irwell, but 72.1 mgl a day are       
 licensed for the public from 39 res.  </content>
