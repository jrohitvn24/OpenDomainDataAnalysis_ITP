		<title>20SCHOOLS MUSIC FESTIVAL.</title>
		<content> The Spilsby and District School's     
 Music Festival began in 1950, being   
 held originally in the Methodist      
 Church, Spilsby and then the Franklin 
 Sec. School, Spilsby. The Festival's  
 numbers grew so that it is now held on
 2 nights annually in the New Town Hall
 Halton Rd. Spilsby. The aim is to draw
 Junior Schools (especially small      
 country primaries) to enjoy music as  
 one group,  and in 1985 also includes 
 sec. school children; in singing,     
 instrumental compositions and         
 accompaniment, and a band. A different
 theme for the music is chosen each    
 year; 1985's being "Songs of Travel"  
 including "Westering Home"- a Scottish
 Song chosen by Halton Holegate School.
 Eleven schools took part altogether.  
 Hon. Secretary is Miss F.O. Malt,     
 Chairman E.W. Willerton, Accompanist  
 R.E. Elliott.                         </content>
