		<content> The first{railway}through{Hucknall    
 was suggested in 1845, The Nottingham 
 and Mansfield Line. The cost was to be
 6d.because there was an excellent     
 Coach Service.In 1848 the first       
 Railway Station opened for traffic.   
 A railway journey from {Hucknall}to   
{London}at this time took 7 1/2 hours. 
 There were 3 railway lines running    
 through Hucknall, but now only 1 is   
 left which is used by the  Colliery.  
 Local opinion regrets the loss of     
 these lines.                          
 The main A road through Hucknall leads
 to the M1 junctions North and South.  
 It is a busy road and had 1,688       
 vehicles along it in 2 hours during   
 our Traffic Count.The main Bus Service
 is from Nottingham through Hucknall to
 Mansfield.There is a local Depot and  
 Bus repair garage.
