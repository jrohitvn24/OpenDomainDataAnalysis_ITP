		<content> The Post Office is the only shop in   
 our area.                             
    The Post Office is closed at twelve
 noon on Saturdays.My mum is in        
 charge.There has been a Post Office in
 Ulpha for eighty years.In the shop we 
 sell ice cream,soft drinks,frozen     
 foods,tinned foods,dairy products and 
 sweets.                               
    The Post Bus comes up every day and
 carries people as well as mail.Three  
 post men are Ronnie,George and Alan   
 and they are very helpful and look in 
 on the old people.They empty the post 
 box in Ulpha at 12 and 5.The post bus 
 has a thirty mile journey every       
 morning except Sunday,and it takes    
 five hours.
