		<content> CAVE DIVING AT WOOKEY HOLE DATES BACK 
 TO 1935 WHEN THE 7TH. CHAMBER OF THE  
 CAVES WAS EXPLORED BY A DIVER WEARING 
 ROYAL NAVY DIVING GEAR. A COMMENTARY  
 WAS GIVEN FOR THE B.B.C.              
    SINCE THAT DATE,CONSIDERABLE       
 EXPLORATION HAS TAKEN PLACE. NINE     
 CHAMBERS ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, BUT  
 25 HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED BY CAVE     
 DIVERS. IN JULY,1985, A DIVER FAILED  
 TO REACH CHAMBER 26, OR TO DISCOVER   
 THE SOURCE OF THE RIVER AXE,BUT SET A 
 BRITISH RECORD WITH A DIVE OF 22O     
 FEET,USING THE MOST MODERN EQUIPMENT. 
    IN THE PAST,TWO DIVERS HAVE LOST   
 THEIR LIVES;THOSE WILLING TO TAKE THE 
 RISK ARE REWARDED BY THE DISCOVERY OF 
 SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGES AND LARGE       
 HALLS,MANY HUNDREDS OF FEET BENEATH   
 THE MENDIP HILLS.
