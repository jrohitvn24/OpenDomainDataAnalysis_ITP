		<title>18INTERESTING PEOPLE</title>
		<content> Most people in our "BLOCK" are very   
 interesting to talk to.For instance   
 one day when I was at the library a   
 man was talking to me about nuclear   
 war and what would the world turn out 
 to be.The{attitudes}of most people are
 kind and friendly and they do not let 
 their troubles get them down.There is 
 one girl on our estate who is         
 handicapped,called Amey,and she cannot
 walk properly or do much with her     
 hands.She still smiles however and she
 is never crying when I see her.My     
 friends are{friendly}-- we sometimes  
 fight but we always make friends      
 again.                                
 The children in our school find the   
{old people}very interesting.They tell 
 you about times long ago and how they 
 lived.My great-grandad helps me with  
 my school work and makes things for me
 and he is 86 yrs.old.                 </content>
