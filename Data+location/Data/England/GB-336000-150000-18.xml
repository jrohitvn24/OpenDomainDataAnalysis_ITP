		<content>    THE FARMER TODAY BEARS NO          
RECEMBLANCE TO HIS COUNTERPART OF FIFTY
YEARS AGO.NOT ONLY DOES HE NEED TO KNOW
ALL ABOUT THE CARE OF HIS ANIMALS,THE  
BREEDING AND REARING OF THE YOUNG,THE  
MILKING,THE SILAGE MAKING AND THE HAY  
MAKING.HE ALSO NEEDS TO BE A MECHANIC,A
HEALTH AND SAFETY EXPERT,A CHEMIST,AN  
ACCOUNTANT AND A PERSON WHO CAN DEAL   
WITH THE VARIOUS INSPECTERS WHO MIGHT  
CALL.                                  
    THE SMALL FARMER,WITH MAYBE 50     
ACRES OF LAND IS RAPIDLY DISAPEARING TO
BE REPLACED BY THE BIG FARMER.         
    THE FARMERS WIFE MAY OCCASIONALLY  
HAVE TIME TO TURN THE SULPHUS MILK INTO
CREAM OR INTO CHEESE BUT THIS IS FOR   
HOME USE AND NOT FOR SALE.SHE NEEDS TO 
LOOK AFTER THE HOME AND FAMILY AS EVER 
BUT ALSO HAS TO DRIVE THE CHILDREN TO  
 CHOOL,DRIVE TO TOWN TO SHOP AND TO    
ASSIST WITH THE MANY OFFICAL FORMS.    </content>
