		<content> The trees on the wooded slopes at the 
 north of our block are mixed,         
 including some sweet chestnut felled  
 about the time of the First World War,
 now grown up again from the stumps.   
 During the 1970s and early 1980s Dutch
 Elm disease killed all the elm trees, 
 which have been cleared away for      
 firewood. Small plantations of mixed  
 trees and one of larch have been      
 planted to replace them.  The         
 remaining hedgerow trees are mainly   
 ash with a few oak. Hedgerow fruits   
 gathered locally are blackberries,    
 crab apples, elderberries and hips. In
 the village there are 2 magnificent   
 copper beeches, a Wellingtonia and    
 horse chestnuts. In the Churchyard    
 there is an avenue of yew trees and in
 the Chapel grounds an old deodar. An  
 oak tree was planted in 1977 to       
 commemorate the Queen's Jubilee.      </content>
