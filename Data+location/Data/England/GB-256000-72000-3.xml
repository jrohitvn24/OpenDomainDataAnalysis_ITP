		<content>           Jay's Grave                 
 There is a grave in the middle of     
 Dartmoor by the side of the road      
 leading north from Hound Tor.         
   The grave is said to be occupied by 
 the body of a servant girl who used to
 work at a nearby farm.She committed   
 suicide because she was betrayed by   
 her lover, but the strange thing is   
 that no matter what time of year, the 
 grave has always got fresh flowers on 
 it.Mysterious isn't it?               
           Hairy Hands                 
 At a narrow bridge between Princetown 
 and Postbridge many accidents have    
 occurred and it is said that a pair of
{'hairy hands'}appear taking control of
 the vehicle, forcing it off the road. 
 One lady, in a caravan parked near the
 bridge, says she saw the hands appear 
 at her window but quickly making the  
 sign of the cross, they disappeared.  </content>
