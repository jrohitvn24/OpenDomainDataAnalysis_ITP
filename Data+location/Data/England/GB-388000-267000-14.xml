		<title>14ELMBRIDGE - GARDENING</title>
		<content> Most gardens are spacious and retain  
 mature trees. Many gardens use water  
 as an interesting feature, either     
 natural or artificially added. Some   
 old water pumps have been kept and a  
 few are still in working order.       
 Sandstone, being the local stone, is  
 widely used for edging, rockeries and 
 walls.                                
 Lawns are featured in every garden,   
 often large and sweeping, bordered    
 with well established wide            
 shrubberies. Colour is added by       
 perennials and heathers under planted 
 with bulbs for the spring.            
 Fruit trees are scattered around the  
 garden but vegetables, if grown, are  
 generally screened from view.         
 Normally included are paved sitting   
 out areas possibly with a built-in    
 barbeque. Gardens are lovingly        
 maintained.                           </content>
