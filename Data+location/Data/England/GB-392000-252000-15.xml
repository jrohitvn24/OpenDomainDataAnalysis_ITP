		<content> The permanent pasture land in the area
 makes it ideal hunting country. It is 
 hunted regularly by The Croome &amp; West 
 Warwickshire Foxhounds. Lady Maria    
 Coventry a joint master is a great    
 grand daughter of The Earl of Coventry
 who founded the pack in 1874.         
 Game shooting is popular in this      
 district with its fine spinneys and   
 coppices.                             
 Gardening is a popular recreation.    
 Gardens are well cared for and many   
 are opened from time to time for a    
 garden 'walkabout'. The garden at     
 Upton Snodsbury garage has a very fine
 and large ornamental fish pond.       
 Several of the public houses have     
 pleasant garden areas where customers 
 may sit at tables in warm weather.
