		<title>12Shopping</title>
		<content> Many of the small villages in the     
 block do not have shops and so the    
 Milborne Port shops are well          
 supported.                            
 There are 3 butchers,1 greengrocer,1  
 haberdasher,1 baker,1 pharmacist,1    
 ironmonger,3 general stores and a     
 newsagent.                            
 When surveyed the shop keepers were,on
 the whole,happy with trading in       
 Milborne Port.They stated that as the 
 population of the area was increasing 
 all the time their trade was          
 improving.                            
 They all employed local people.As they
 are in constant competition with the  
 large supermarkets in Yeovil they all 
 felt the need to keep their prices as 
 low as possible.Most people surveyed  
 did at least 45% of their shopping in 
 the village.                          
                                       </content>
