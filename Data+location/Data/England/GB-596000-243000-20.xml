		<content>The nearest railway is some twelve     
miles away.  The roads in this area are
not major ones and have not been       
widened or straightened.  In many cases
they follow the boundaries of fields in
a series of right angle bends.         
On the other hand the traffic using the
area, to supply public houses or small 
shops, includes many large vehicles    
which at times travel at speeds in     
excess of safety.                      
The roads are sometimes hedge lined or 
the fields are higher than the road    
level.  In Winter, snow drifts can     
cause a 'road' to disappear, or        
drifting snow can cause drifting       
against hedges.  Some of these 'hedge  
shaded' lanes do not thaw sufficiently 
and remain icey for long periods.      
The heavy lorries break up the edges of
the roads.                             
                                       </content>
