		<title>13DERELICT LAND.</title>
		<content> In the area there is very little      
 derelict land. The fields without     
 crops were mostly overgrown tall      
 grasses,wild flowers,and weeds. The   
 north east region near Whittle Brook  
 contained an isolated Smallpox        
 Hospital which was demolished with    
 only the 3m perimeter wall intact. The
 area outside the wall was also waste  
 ground. Whittle Brook flows behind the
 hospital and seemed to be fairly      
 clear. North of the brook another     
 derelict area was discovered, this was
 very rough undulating land. This area 
 was once used by the American Airforce
 as a dump for refuse. It is mainly    
 used for motorbike scrambling. Many   
 wild plants could be found including  
 Foxglove. Southeast of the map was    
 heavily industrialised but many       
 buildings had been demolished.
