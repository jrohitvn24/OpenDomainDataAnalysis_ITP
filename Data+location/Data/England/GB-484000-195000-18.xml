		<content>    In the Domesday Book of 1086       
Hughenden Manor is referred to as      
Huchedene.It had been given to Bishop  
Odo of Bayeux at the time of The       
Conquest.                              
    The present house was built in 1738
in Georgian Gothic style.(The West Wing
was added later.)It is famous because  
it was purchased in 1848 by Benjamin   
Disraeli,the great 19th century leader 
of the Tories and Prime Minister.He    
lived here with his wife,Mary Anne,when
-ever possible as they loved the place.
The house was given to the National    
Trust in 1947.                         
    Surrounded by woodland the Manor   
has a most attractive site with the    
brick and flint parish church of       
Hughenden nearby where Disraeli and his
wife are buried.                       
    27000 visitors came to the House in
1981,the centenary of Disraeli's death.</content>
