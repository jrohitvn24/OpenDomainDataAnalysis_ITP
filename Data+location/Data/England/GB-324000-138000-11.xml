		<title>11My Hobby,Cannington</title>
		<content> I have a hobby which is called        
 majorettes.I practice in a school     
 every Monday and Friday at night.We   
 march and twirl a baton which is a    
 metal stick with rubber ends.I joined 
 when I was seven and have been in two 
 troupes since then.In my club we have 
 got a band but some troupes have got  
 taped music.Our uniform is darkish    
 blue with a white design and has got a
 cape at the back.The band wear white  
 trousers with blue and white tops.Our 
 hats are tall with white fur on them  
 with a blue emblem.The troupe I belong
 to are the Bridgwater Kestrels.The    
 band's instruments are the            
 beliah,drums,cymbals and bass         
 drum.Leading us is a Drum Major with a
 mace who shouts out directions.
