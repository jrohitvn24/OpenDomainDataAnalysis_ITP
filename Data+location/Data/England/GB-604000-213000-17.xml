		<title>17CHANGES IN EAST MERSEA</title>
		<content>   Several old people were questioned  
 about changes that have occurred in   
 East Mersea. This century the most    
 important developments have been the  
 provision of mains water, mains       
 sewerage and electricity. These       
 replaced wells, earth closets, oil    
 lamps and candles. Cars have replaced 
 horses but East Mersea is still       
 comparatively peaceful.               
   There have been many changes in the 
 landscape. Fields have been enlarged  
 to take modern agricultural machinery 
 ( recently seven fields were made into
 one ), footpaths have disappeared and 
 the golf course has been replaced by  
 Cudmore Grove Country Park. This has  
 attracted more visitors but the older 
 residents say there is little         
 vandalism and life in the village is  
 still pleasant and quiet.
