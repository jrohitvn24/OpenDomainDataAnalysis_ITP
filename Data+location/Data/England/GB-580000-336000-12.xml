		<content> The largest event in Stanhoe is Open  
 Gardens Sunday which brings people    
 into the village from afar and has    
 become an annual one.  Six gardens are
 open with various attractions, stalls 
 of all kinds, games, raffles; the     
 result usually amounting to about     
 Â£1000, the whole sum given to the     
 Parish Church restoration fund.       
 Hospital Sunday, an event once common 
 to every village in the county is held
 now only in Stanhoe, outdoors.  Led by
 a Salvation Army Band hymns and       
 prayers are offered by Ministers from 
 both churches, the collection being   
 devoted to amenities for patients in  
 hospital.  Other smaller events,      
 sports on the playing field, coffee   
 mornings, collections, special efforts
 for major repairs to the churches,    
 Ethiopia, cancer, old folk's gifts etc
