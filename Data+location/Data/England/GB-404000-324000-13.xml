		<title>13MEMORIES OF A 9O YEAR OLD</title>
		<content> We visited an old lady who was born in
 Ironbridge but who moved to Abbots    
 Bromley in 192O. She found it very    
 quiet here with very little traffic.  
 A horse and cart went to Uttoxeter and
 a bus to Burton once a week. Two men  
 swept the village street and spread   
 fresh straw every week.               
 She closed her general store in the   
 village more than twenty years ago.   
 She served in her shop from 8am until 
 8pm.                                  
 People were very poor but clean and   
 she remembers that you did not have to
 lock your doors. Her house and the    
 wood yard opposite were the first to  
 have electricity in Abbots Bromley.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
