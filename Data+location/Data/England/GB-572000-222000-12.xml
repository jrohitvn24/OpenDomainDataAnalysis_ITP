		<title>12Bank Street, Braintree.</title>
		<content>   {Bank Street}is part of the traffic 
 network in Braintree but over the last
 two years it has become pedestrianised
 with only delivery lorries allowed.   
 The road is now blocked off with a    
 mosaic of tiles.                      
    Years ago before the town's one way
 system came into use{Bank Street}was  
 one of the main roads running through 
 to the High street, linking the road  
 from Halstead to Chelmsford.          
    The fire engines used to run       
 through{Bank Street}onto the crossroad
 at the White Hart Hotel, when entering
 and leaving the fire station, but they
 have built a new road so the vehicles 
 can exit without conjestion.          
    You can probably guess why it is   
 called{Bank Street}as it has Lloyds,  
 Barclays and the Midland Bank, along  
 with a building society.
