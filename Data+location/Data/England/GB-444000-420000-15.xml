		<content> Over half this block consists of the  
 buildings of the main town of         
 Pontefract.New housing estates have   
 been built since the War,mainly at    
 present towards the South.The Kings   
 High School is situated on the edge   
 of a magnesium limestone outlay at 71m
 in the mid western square and the     
 ruins of Pontefract Castle stand on a 
 sandstone prominence at 50m in the    
 inner northern square.The new &amp; old   
 Prince of Wales coalmines in the NW   
 square provide employment and coal for
 Ferrybridge Power Station.Agriculture 
 is mainly arable with oil seed rape   
 becoming common.The Leeds-Goole and   
 York-Sheffield Railway lines and the  
 A1 and M62 roads nearby,serve the     
 town.On farmland,hedges have been     
 removed to create larger more         
 economically sized fields.
