		<content>  Lydbrook_Patterns of Health.During   
 last century Lydbrook was a most      
 unhealthy place to live.The brook     
 running through the valley to the     
 river was little better than an open  
 sewer which spread disease and        
 accounted for many deaths.Early this  
 century people living in the houses   
 near the bottom of the village were   
 forced to remain indoors on hot days  
 because of obnoxious smells.          
 Tuberculosis caused many deaths.Miners
 suffered with silicosis,other chest   
 troubles such as bronchitis and asthma
 were and still are common.Happily the 
 brook now trickles harmlessly through 
 the village to the river which proves 
 a popular canoeing centre for         
 visitors.The high level of humidity in
 the area could be the cause of the    
 number of people requiring grommets   
 in their ears.                        </content>
