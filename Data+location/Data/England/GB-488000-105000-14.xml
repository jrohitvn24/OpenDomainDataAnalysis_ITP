		<title>14ST. ANDREWS CHURCH</title>
		<content> The oldest building in Tangmere       
 village, found in the extreme         
 south-west of the village and first   
 mentioned in the Domesday Book, is    
 St. Andrews Church. It was probably   
 first built in Saxon days, but the    
 present Church was constructed in the 
 early 12th century.  St. Andrews has  
 one of the oldest fonts in Sussex, tub
 shaped and made of stone.  The        
 bell-cote and the spire were added in 
 the 13th century.  In 1985 it remains 
 attractive and well cared for, the    
 graveyard often attracts interest as  
 there are several graves of both      
 German and British Airmen alongside   
 old village names such as Bayley and  
 Osborn. The Vicar who lives in        
 Boxgrove has dual responsibility for  
 both parishes. He spends Thursday in  
 the village spending time at the      
 School and with the parishoners.      </content>
