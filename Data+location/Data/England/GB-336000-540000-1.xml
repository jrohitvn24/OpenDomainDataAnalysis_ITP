		<title>01Farmland in Cumbria</title>
		<content> The block, which is 125 - 175 metres  
 above sealevel, consists largely      
 of farmland divided into small fields.
 There are patches of deciduous        
 woodland, especially along the rivers 
 and streams, which have carved out    
 steep little valleys.                 
 There are only about 50 dwellings on  
 the whole block, farms and cottages   
 scattered across the area and one tiny
 hamlet, Churchtown.                   
 Services are minimal, the nearest     
 Doctors' surgery is 5  miles away.    
 There is no public transport at all.  
 Three travelling shops and a mobile   
 library visit the area and there is a 
 Post Office at Churchtown and a pub at
 Sour Nook, The Royal Oak.             
 There are many neglected areas of     
 rough woodland and wide roadside      
 verges where plants and wildlife      
 flourish.                             </content>
