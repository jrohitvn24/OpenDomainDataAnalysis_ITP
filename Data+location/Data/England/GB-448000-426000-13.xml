   At school we play many different    
 games. The boys like to play football 
 or cricket in the playground. The     
 girls like to play rounders or tennis.
 Chasing games are very popular too.   
   We have found a new game called     
 netball-rounders. When you bat you try
 and hit the ball away from the        
 fielders and then run around the      
 court. The other team have to try and 
 return the ball and put it into the   
 netball goalnet before you can run to 
 the homebase.                         
   Off the ground tig is fun. You have 
 to try and tig someone when they are  
 on the ground. They can only stay on  
 the wall or steps or drainpipes etc.  
 for a few seconds before changing     
 position.
