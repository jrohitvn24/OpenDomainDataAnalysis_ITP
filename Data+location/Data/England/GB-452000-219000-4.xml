		<content>Since it was constructed in the 1914-18
war,it has operated in the training    
role. It never aquired permanent       
runways,and this fact has contributed  
to its survival as an airfield,for it  
has been used principally as parachute 
dropping zone by No.1 Parachute Train- 
ing School since 1946. This school has 
been based at Upper Heyford,then Abing-
don and now Brize Norton.At the present
time trainee paratroops make their     
first descents from a basket suspended 
beneath a captive baloon at Weston,    
followed by drops from Hercules air-   
craft of the Lyneham Transport Wing,   
culminating in drops in full combat    
gear with weapon packs suspended below 
their feet.Instructors,members of the  
Special Forces and NATO paratroops also
use the airfield for exercise drops,   
sometimes from Puma helicopters.
