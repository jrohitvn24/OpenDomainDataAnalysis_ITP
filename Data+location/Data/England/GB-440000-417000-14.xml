		<title>14A FARMERS WORK</title>
		<content>   The small farmers in our area work  
 very hard, often rising at about      
 6.30am and finshing at evening time . 
 Most farmers grow {wheat, barley, }and
{rape} as well as rearing live stock.  
 The rape is grown for oil and sent    
 straight from the combine to the oil  
 crushers. Cereal crops are used mainly
 for animal feed.                      
   A typical farmer we spoke to has    
 over 700 pigs, and he spends much of  
 his working day looking after them.   
 They are fed early in the morning and 
 cleaned out once a week.              
   A farmers work may be harder or more
 unpleasant than an ordinary persons   
 job for example he may have to be     
 available 7 days a week, 52 weeks     
 a year including Xmas Day and Bank    
 Holidays. People have to be called in 
 to look after the animals if he wishes
 to take a break.                      </content>
