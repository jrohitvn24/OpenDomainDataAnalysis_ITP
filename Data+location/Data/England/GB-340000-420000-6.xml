    When he was a child all farming was
done by horse and plough. The farmers  
grew vegetables in summer and went out 
shrimping in winter, however, if       
shrimping was paying well in the       
summer, vegetables would be neglected. 
(Some Banks families still go shrimping
off the coast at Lytham and shell,     
cook, and pot at home as a cottage     
industry.) The main hobbies when he was
young were shooting and fishing, both  
still popular in the area.             
    Mr. Fazakerly's hobby nowadays is  
carving wood. He sometimes sells the   
carvings at local fairs.
