		<title>20Cold Norton - Domesday 1985.</title>
		<content> This Domesday Survey has been carried 
 out by teachers and pupils from Cold  
 Norton Primary School durint the      
 summer term of 1985. It has been an   
 interesting term's work but has kept  
 us , and particularly the two teachers
 who have been involved, (Mr Cuff and  
 Mr Emery) very busy and has only been 
 completed right at the end of term    
 which finished on July 19th.          
 The survey has been made more         
 difficult by the very disappointing   
 weather of this summer which has made 
 it almost imposible tp get out of the 
 school for much of the term. However, 
 eventually, all the children  in the  
 third and fourth years (aged 9 to 11) 
 have helped in some way and this has  
 been the finished project. We hope one
 day that we shall be able to afford   
 one of the players so we shall be able
 to see the finished survey.           </content>
