 ARCHITECTURAL SURVEY of Buckland      
 Common.                               
 Pre-WW1 housing continued:            
 interest were the planks of old wood  
 between the jutting out sections of   
 roof and the upper windows.           
 Another type of pre-WW1 building was  
 the Cholesbury Village Hall built in  
 1895.It had rectangular windows with  
 rounded tops.Much smaller than the    
 earlier Victorian house,it was        
 surrounded by railings.The tiled roof 
 was also bumpy with sections of roof  
 again overlapping the windows.        
 Modern housing:                       
 An outstanding modern house was found 
 in the area dating from the 1960s.It  
 had a garage,red brick walls,a        
 boundary wall with patterns on the    
 top,and a porch with pillars.         </content>
