		<content> The block consists mostly of pastoral 
 farmland interspersed by streams and  
 woods. The River Torridge flows       
 through the centre from west to east. 
 To the north and south the land slopes
 down to the river's flood plain. Above
 and to the south stands the village of
 Black Torrington with St Mary's Church
 ,Hope Chapel, school,public hall, inn,
 playing field, surgery, general store 
 and sub-post office, a few business   
 premises and housing for the two      
 hundred inhabitants. The main street, 
 lined by houses and terraced cottages,
 leads to the church, while side roads 
 complete two rectangles to the east.  
 Adults follow a variety of occupations
 , half outside the village, while 25% 
 of residents are retired. One         
 kilometre to the north west stands    
 Coham House, the ancestral home of the
 Coham-Fleming family, set in woodland.</content>
