		<title>11HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> I live in a house which is nearly 300 
 years old. It is situated on the      
 Worcester boundary. It has 17 rooms   
 and has quite a big garden at the back
 it has a swimming pool. It has a porch
 with a wooden door. We have a doorbell
 which plays tunes. We don't have many 
 neighbours only a house across the    
 road. My mum has a cooker,a fridge,a  
 dishwasher, washing machine and a     
 microwave to help her do her work.My  
 dad has a J.C.B. which he uses to do  
 some of his jobs. My mum goes to      
 Sainsburys once a week to buy most of 
 our food. She goes to town on a Friday
 to buy extra groceries. She buys tins 
 of beans,fruit,spaghetti and soup. She
 buys jars of coffee and tea bags. My  
 favourite food is Spaghetti Bolagnaise
 and Stroganoff and prawns. I do not   
 like any vegetables.
