		<content> Out of all the things in Leintwardine 
 the{church}has always been the main   
 attraction.Nobody knows the exact     
 depth of the foundations.The massive  
 church{steeple}towers 70 feet up with 
{103}steps inside.The {bells}are not   
 the originals, but 5 of them are older
 than the others.In all there are 8    
 bells.The roof of the{nave}is 15th    
 century. At a lower level are the     
 corbels of an earlier roof.The roofs  
 of the{aisles and north-aisle}chapel  
 are also 15th century,but that of the 
 mortimer chapel-the trussed  rafter   
 type-is 14th century.There are two    
 grave-yards because there were too    
 many graves to fit into the church    
 yard so they opened a cemetry which is
 now opposite the primary school.
