  During the past year a community     
 programme has been introduced to the  
 people of the village.This is held in 
 the Methodist Chapel which has been   
 specially redesigned to house the     
 variety of activities which are now   
 being provided.                       
{Senior Citizens.                      
  A Day-Centre operates which acts as a
 social meeting place for the many     
 older people who feel lonely, or who  
 like to meet with others outside their
 own homes.Various speakers are invited
 to talk with the members to help give 
 them interests and also topics of     
 conversation afterwards.              
  Meals are provided on certain days   
 for those who enjoy eating-out with   
 other people.                         
  Day outings are frequently arranged  
 and are proving to be very popular.   </content>
