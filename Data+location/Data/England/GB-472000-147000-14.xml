		<content> WE MADE A SURVEY OF THE               
 PRIVATE HOUSING IN                    
 OUR AREA AND FOUND THAT APPROXIAMETLY 
 THREE QUARTERS OF THE HOUSES WERE     
 BUILT BEFORE 1900.  LESS THAN 10% HAD 
 BEEN BUILT IN THE PAST 20 YEARS.  SOME
 OF THE HOUSING GOES BACK TO THE TIME  
 OF ELIZABETH I BUT MOST OF IT WAS     
 BUILT IN THE 19TH CENTURY.  THERE ARE 
 VERY FEW BUNGALOWS AND MOST OF THE    
 HOUSES ARE DETACHED.  THE SMALL NUMBER
 OF ATTACHED HOUSES ARE GENERALLY TO BE
 FOUND IN THE SMALL ESTATES OF COUNCIL 
 HOUSING IN LONG SUTTON AND SOUTH      
 WARNBOROUGH.  IN THE RAF MARRIED      
 QUARTERS AT RAF ODIHAM THERE ARE      
 SEVERAL ROWS OF TERRACED HOUSES.      
 BECAUSE THE PRIVATE HOUSES IN OUR AREA
 ARE NOW VERY EXPENSIVE, THERE ARE NOT 
 MANY YOUNG LOCAL PEOPLE ABLE TO BUY   
 AND THIS MEANS THEY HAVE TO MOVE AWAY.
