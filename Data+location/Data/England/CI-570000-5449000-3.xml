		<title>03MONT ORGUEIL CASTLE (2)</title>
		<content>    In this account of our visit I am  
 going to act as a guide to show you   
 around this magnificent fortress.     
    From here, outside the towering    
 granite curtain walls, we can see     
 uneven rocks on the west side of the  
 castle, which are part of the mound,  
 and indicate how strong it must be    
 with rock as a foundation.            
    As we cross the bridge over the dry
 grass moat you come to the first of   
 four gates, where there used to be a  
 portcullis. This entrance was very    
 heavily guarded as it was the weakest 
 point of the castle, facing the       
 landward side. To strengthen it even  
 more the{Harliston Tower,}which you   
 can see on your left, was built in    
 1470. The second gate, built in the   
 13th century, also had a drawbridge   
 and a portcullis.
