		<title>12Living in Idstone</title>
		<content>  In Idstone there is a Bus Stop and   
nearby a red Telephone Box.Therefore   
you can phone whoever you want to for  
10 pence, if you have no private       
telephone.The travelling Library and   
the Butcher's Van also stop in Idstone.
There are three farms in Idstone and   
they all have dairies - so no one goes 
short of milk!  The Video Van comes    
round every Saturday. They sell        
sweets,crisps and drinks as well. If   
you are interested in fishing there    
are 3 ponds of which two have fish in. 
The disadvantage of Idstone is that we 
have to cycle to Ashbury or Bishop-    
stone to go to a shop in the week,or   
to school. There is not even a Youth   
Club! Most of my friends live in       
Ashbury one mile away.
