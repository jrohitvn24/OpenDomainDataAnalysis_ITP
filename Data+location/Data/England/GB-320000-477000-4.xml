		<title>04SHOPPING FACILITIES</title>
		<content>     The shops are mainly small but    
 supply a wide range of food and       
 general household goods in daily need.
 There is a Co-operative Store at the  
 corner of Duke Street and Duddon Road.
 It is by far the largest shop in the  
 area. There are several "corner shops"
 in the housing areas but most of the  
 shopping facilities are concentrated  
 along Duke Street. They are adequate  
 for the day to day shopping needs of  
 the local residents although there may
 be problems of restricted choice for  
 some items. Other shopping needs must 
 be satisfied in the nearby towns of   
 Barrow,Ulverston and Dalton, this     
 involves the added cost of travelling.
 It follows that a small population can
 only support a shop that sells goods  
 in general and regular consumption,   
 such as bread and other foodstuffs.
