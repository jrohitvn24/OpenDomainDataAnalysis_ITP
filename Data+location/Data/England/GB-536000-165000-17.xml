		<content>   On Saturday,my brother and I get up 
at 7.30 and watch TV until nine.At nine
Mum and Dad get up and we all have Corn
Flakes for breakfast. After breakfast, 
we all have a wash and get dressed.    
   For the rest of the morning my bro- 
ther and I play in the garden. My Mum  
washes clothes and my Dad does jobs a- 
round the house.At 11.00 my Mum and Dad
take me to my swimming lessons.        
   When we get back from swimming we   
all have lunch. After we have had lunch
our nanny comes to see us and we have a
talk and play games.                   
   At 6.00 we have tea and after I have
 my bath while my Mum washes up. After 
my bath the whole family watches TV un-
til nine. At nine my brother and I go  
to bed.
