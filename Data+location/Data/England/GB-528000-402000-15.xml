		<title>15ATTITUDES IN HOLTON-LE-CLAY</title>
		<content> Early this year{boundary changes in   
{Lincolnshire}were considered. A group 
 of children went to see a lady about  
{boundary changes in Holton-Le-Clay.   
 She showed us many things like        
 letters, lists of people who wanted to
 stay in{Lincolnshire}and maps of      
{Holton-Le-Clay}and near by{Humberston.
 She said that when they first found   
 out about the{boundary changes}a      
{campaign committee}was set up. Letters
 were sent out to let the villagers    
 know about the proposed changes and to
 let them know if they wanted to stay  
 in{Lincolnshire.}The group has written
 to the{Boundary Commission,}to the    
{Prime Minister}and to their{local M.P.
 Finally the group won and             
{Holton-le-Clay}stayed in{Lincolnshire.
 The group still carries on with its   
 work as boundaries will be            
 reconsidered next year.               </content>
