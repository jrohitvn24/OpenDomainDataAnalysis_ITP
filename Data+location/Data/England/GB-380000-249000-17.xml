		<title>17A Day in My Life: Robert.</title>
		<content> My name is Robert Williams.I am 13,and
 I live at Stockend Farm with my       
 father,mother and 3 sisters (17,16,2).
 I get up at 7am,and before breakfast I
 help Dad to get the cows in,and fill  
 buckets of water to wash them before  
 milking.At 8am,I walk to the road to  
 catch the school bus.School lasts from
 8.55am _ 3.30pm,and then I catch the  
 bus home again.                       
 When I get home,I feed our 5 dogs, 12 
 cats and rabbit,and I walk the cows up
 the field.After tea I help with the   
 milking. At about 7pm I do some school
 work,and then I watch TV until I go to
 bed at 9.00pm.                        
 At the weekend,I go fishing,or beat   
 for shooting,or ride my bike to my    
 Gran's,or on Sunday we may go out,    
 because someone comes in to do the    
 milking:I always help on the farm, and
 the work depends on the season.       </content>
