		<title>03LOCAL HISTORY OF WATER MILL.</title>
		<content>                                       
 There was a mill at Fladbury at the   
 time of the original Domesday Survey. 
 The water mill was a valuable part of 
 the manor.It ground corn using two    
 water-wheels until the turn of the    
 century and at that time the water    
 wheel at the end of the mill was      
 replaced with two turbines.           
 In 1888 electricity was first charged 
 at the mill by the large water-wheel  
 but two turbines were installed in the
 early 1900's which ran until 1926.    
 Since 1980 the area where the old     
 turbines were has been rebuilt.A      
 replacement turbine now drives a 13KW 
 generator and the power charged       
 provides domestic heating for the     
 attached mill house.
