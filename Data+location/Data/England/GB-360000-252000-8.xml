		<content>{GAME OF BRITISH BULLDOG.              
 You have two wolves standing in the   
 middle of the playground waiting for  
 you.One of the wolves shouts who they 
 want for their tea.They call out the  
 name of who they will catch.That child
 runs out to see if he or she can get  
 to the other side.The wolves try to   
 tag that child.If they succeed that   
 child is on it with the wolves.If the 
 named child gets to the other side he 
 or she can walk back,without the      
 wolves being able to get that child.  
     If that child is tagged he or she 
 is on it with the wolves.The wolves   
 all shout another child's name,however
 this time the named child has to be   
 picked up instead of being tagged.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
