     These were built to defend our    
 shores against an earlier planned     
 invasion,that of Napoleon.This        
 circular tower,with walls nearly 6ft  
 thick,had a swivel cannon mounted on  
 the roof,and it was defended by 1     
 officer and 24 men.This was actually  
 the westernmost of these{Martello     
{Towers,}which were built to cover the 
 Kent and Sussex coastline,and many can
 still be seen in the neighbouring     
 Eastbourne_Pevensey region.This       
 particular one was finished in 1806 by
 which time invasion was unlikely as   
 Napoleon's combined French and Spanish
 fleet had been virtually destroyed by 
 Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar.    
 It has been used as a cafe,a skating  
 rink and a house.It is now a Museum.
