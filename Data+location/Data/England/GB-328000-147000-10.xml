		<title>10BURNHAM-ON-SEA AS A RESORT.</title>
		<content>                                       
  Many people come to Burnham year     
 after year for their holidays. This   
 must be because we have a mild climate
 here, although the air is frequently  
 bracing with westerly winds. We also  
 have miles of golden sands which is   
 lovely for children to play in. Being 
 a river estuary there are also patches
 of mud, but these are well marked and 
 easy to avoid.                        
                                       
  Burnham is particularly famous for   
 its glorious sunsets, and of course it
 is easily reached because of the      
 proximity of the M5. It is an         
 extremely good centre to visit if you 
 want to tour Somerset or Avon, and    
 there are dozens of gorgeous tourist  
 attractions and places of natural     
 beauty within easy reach.
