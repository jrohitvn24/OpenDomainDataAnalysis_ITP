		<title>11Nidderdale show: Pateley.</title>
		<content> Every year in September,the Nidderdale
 Agricultural Show is held in Bewerley 
 Park. The committee of the Nidderdale 
 Agricultural Society organises it and 
 competitors come from all over York-  
 shire and even further. Some families 
 make it part of their annual holiday. 
 A few classes are for local entrants  
 only, who must live within a nine mile
 radius from Pateley Bridge. Most of   
 the dale's farmers are subscribers to 
 the show. They can give from Â£3.00 to 
 Â£20.00 and, therefore, do not pay an  
 entrance fee on the day of the show.  
 Entry fees for the public are Â£1.50   
 for adults and 75p for children. There
 are many different competitions such  
 as: dog-trials, show-jumping, rabbits,
 poultry and produce. Marquees are put 
 up during the weekend of the show. On 
 the day of the show the park is full  
 of people, stalls and animals.        </content>
