		<content>  One day my family went for a  walk   
 past Courtaulds old Factory site.By   
 the side there was a mound of grass.  
 My dad asked me it I knew what it     
 was.                                  
 He told me it was an Airraid shelter. 
 We went down in side. There were lots 
 of cotten reels. It had a ladder up   
 one end to see if it was safe to go   
 back. It was dry and smaller than i   
 imagined. On Courtaulds site there    
 were three or four airraid shelters.  
 The airraid shelter was an oval       
 shape.                                
 There were more shelters on the site. 
 One had been knocked down because it  
 was falling in.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
