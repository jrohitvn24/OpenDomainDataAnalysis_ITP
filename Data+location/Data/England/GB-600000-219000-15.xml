      Being an open rural area, the    
 amenities are restricted to a doctor  
 group practice surgery and clinic in  
 Rowhedge, which is open each day,     
 while at Fingringhoe there is a       
 doctor's surgery, but the doctor only 
 comes to the village hall every       
 Wednesday afternoon.  There are old   
 people's homes in both villages and a 
 Health Visitor has responsibility for 
 the area.                             
       The E. Donyland Community       
 Association has been formed to provide
 the village with a large community    
 centre which has been paid for through
 continual fund-raising by the whole   
 village
