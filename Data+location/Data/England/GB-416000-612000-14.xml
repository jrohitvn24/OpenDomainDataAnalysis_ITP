		<content> MAFF stands for Ministry of           
 Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It  
 is at Lion House and gives information
 to farmers.  They have an HQ in White 
 Hall, London.  They have a            
 publications department full of       
 information on animals.  Lion House   
 was opened on 8 August 1968 by Sir    
 Basil Engholm.  It has been running   
 for 17 years and it has 66 staff.     
 Staff who travel around England used  
 to send their travel claims to        
 Guildford but now they send them to   
 Lion House.  Department Five handles  
 animal care and diseases.  Mostly they
 go down to farms to check the animals 
 to make sure they aren't ill.  In the 
 publications department people do the 
 printing.  They have lots of leaflets 
 _ at least 2000 of them in a room.    
 They use computers to check the number
 of leaflets once a year.              </content>
