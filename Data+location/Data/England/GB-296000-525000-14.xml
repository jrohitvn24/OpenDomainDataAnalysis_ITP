		<title>14HARRINGTON NEAR WORKINGTON</title>
		<content>{Harrington}is a{small sea port}2.5    
 miles south of Workington on the      
 Cumbrian coast. It has a large harbour
 which reflects that it was once an    
 important port used for transporting  
 coal and iron ore while{shipbuilding  
 was the principle industry. The port  
 today is used to harbour small        
 pleasure craft and is no longer used  
 for commercial purposes.              
     Harrington's main{residential area
 is away from the harbour and many     
 people who live there come from       
 surrounding areas like Workington. The
 older houses of Harrington are        
 situated on Church Road and there     
 abouts.There are many public houses   
 which reflects it's maritime past.    
     Many of Harrington's industrial   
 sites have been demolished and are now
 mainly{public open space.
