		<title>10Lea Nurseries. Moor Hall.</title>
		<content>Used to be farms but are now not.The   
nearest shops are at Cottom.           
{Lea Nurseries} is approximately 50    
years old.The owner says he enjoys his 
work,  although he doesn't get many    
customers. He likes the area except    
for the buildings which have recently  
been constructed.The nurseries cover   
3\4 acres,which the owner says is just 
enough.                                
{Moor Hall} was built during the 17th  
century.The owners,along with the      
house,own about 65 acres of land.      
However,they do not farm the land,but  
{rent the land} to neighbouring farms. 
Again,the owners like the area,but are 
not keen on the new buildings.On the   
land surrounding the farmhouse,{hens,  
cows and bulls} are to be found.The    
fields around are given up to the      
growing of grass.
