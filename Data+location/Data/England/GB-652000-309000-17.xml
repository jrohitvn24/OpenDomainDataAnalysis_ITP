   We visited North Denes Heliport &amp;   
 met a pilot,Simon Bedford. We were    
 shown an orange safety suit which was 
 waterproof with two red plastic grids.
 It has a hood,a long zip and a strap  
 to go over the zip. Inside the sleeves
 there are two blue gloves uswd for the
 cold weather.To wear it you must      
 remove footware,tuck in the           
 neckflap,pull up the zip &amp; fasten the 
 strap. A lifejacket is also worn      
 around the waist. It is folded up &amp;   
 secured in a packet. To inflate you   
 must pull out straps, hold the bag    
 around your waist,raise over your head
 and pull the toggle.                  
  Marsha tried it on."I felt really    
 silly. The suit was rather large for  
 me, but it was warm inside.I couldn't 
 help laughing".                       </content>
