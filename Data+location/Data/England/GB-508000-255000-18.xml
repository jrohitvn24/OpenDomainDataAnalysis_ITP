		<title>18SWIMMING LESSON IN WILDEN.</title>
		<content> Each week we all go swimming at Mr.   
 Prigmore's pool. It's inside and      
 heated. We can all swim before we're  
 six. We do front crawl, backstroke,   
 breaststroke, and butterfly. We dive, 
 too. Mrs. Gleave teaches us. We win   
 badges, certificates and medals. I    
 have got my bronze, silver, and gold, 
 and mile because I'm nearly nine.     
 After the lesson if we've been good,  
 we have playtime, and play with balls 
 and the raft.                         
  The pool is quite deep, and we have  
 to go in groups. Girls wear swimming  
 caps. Boys don't though. My brother   
 often needs the toilet. He's lucky    
 because there is one. The infants are 
 lucky, they don't have to swim so     
 hard. Our parents transport us there  
 in cars with our teacher, and help to 
 dry us. We go in for Galas and win    
 shields sometimes. It is good fun.    </content>
