		<title>11LOCAL HISTORY OF GRIMLEY</title>
		<content>    Grimley was mentioned in the orig- 
 inal Domesday Book as Gremanhil and   
 Grimanleh. Much of the land was held  
 by the Church (re:Housing). The Domes-
 day Book also mentions a water mill   
 (Ball Mill). Within living memory, the
 mill used to house a baker, butcher   
 and coalman.It is now a private house.
    The prior of Worcester lived at the
 Manor in Grimley. It was destroyed at 
 the end of the 17th century.          
    Grimley National School was built  
 in 1834.It is now a cottage(re:school)
    Derelict brickworks are by the     
 River Severn. There was a ford nearby.
 Forty years ago, visitors used to swim
 and picnic by the river. Now fishermen
 are the usual visitors.               
    The first Post Office(pre 1884) was
 next to the churchyard. Then it was   
 moved next to The Manse before moving 
 to its present site in 1936.          </content>
