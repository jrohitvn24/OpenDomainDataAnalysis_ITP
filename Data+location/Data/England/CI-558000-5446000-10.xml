		<title>10NOIRMONT HEADLAND</title>
		<content>   The bleak but beautiful headland of 
 Noirmont is covered by moorland plants
 such as gorse and heather and offers  
 fine views of the cliffs and the sea. 
 It is a popular area for walkers and  
 horse riders.                         
   During the '39-'45 war the occupying
 German forces constructed a number of 
 fortifications, often of reinforced   
 concrete, around the headland. Many of
 these gunsites or bunkers still       
 remain, indeed they have proved       
 difficult to remove. Some have been   
 restored by a local society and are   
 opened to tourists, others stay closed
 up. They are the evidence of the only 
 occupation of British soil by a       
 foreign power for hundreds of years.
