 it to the local Quinneys dairy where  
 it is bottled ready for sale.  A small
 amount is made into cream.  The jobs  
 on the farm are closely linked to the 
 rearing of dariy cow's and the growing
 of hay to feed them.  The cows graze  
 in the fields in the summer but in the
 winter the cows stay in the barns and 
 farm yards.  The main summer jobs     
 include feeding the calbes, milking   
 and cleaning out the milking parlour  
 and farmyard.  Haymaking starts in    
 late summer.  In the winter the jobs  
 are restricted to hedging and general 
 repairs to the fences and gates.
