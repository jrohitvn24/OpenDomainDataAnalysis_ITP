		<title>06MY HOUSE</title>
		<content> I live in a semi-detached house on    
 Fairless Avenue, Lightcliffe. There   
 are 6 rooms: a bathroom, a front room,
 a dining room, 2 bedrooms and a       
 kitchen. There are 4 people in my     
 family, so we have enough room in our 
 semi-detached house. We have carpets  
 in each room, with curtains, pictures 
 and furniture. My bedroom is painted  
 red and white. When we moved into our 
 house it didn't have a drive, now it  
 does. We have also put ranch fencing  
 around the garden. We have a shed.    
 lawns and stone flower boxes in       
 the garden. We have various different 
 types of electrical equipment in the  
 house. In the front room is a T.V. a  
 video, organ and stereo. My bedroom   
 has a T.V. a computer, cassette player
 and a stereo. In the kitchen we have  
 a washing machine, kettle, drier,     
 food mixer, clock, cooker and fridge. </content>
