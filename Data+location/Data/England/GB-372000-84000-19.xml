		<content> Most village activities are run for   
 or by women.Although some men are     
 prominent on committees,it is women   
 who have most influence on village    
 life.Men traditionally commute to     
 work,do not form the same social      
 relations,pursue more individual      
 hobbies &amp; so can easily feel detached 
 from village life,whereas women are   
 more home &amp; village based with time   
 &amp; energy to spare.From their          
 children'S earliest days mothers      
 continually socialise at toddler      
 group,playgroup,school gates or while 
 taxi-ing them about.Important links   
 are formed here &amp; reinforced at coffee
 mornings,jumbles,on committees etc.   
 Many significant influential women are
 not indigenous Dorset people with     
 relatives nearby,perhaps their social 
 network compensates for loss of the   
 extended family.                      </content>
