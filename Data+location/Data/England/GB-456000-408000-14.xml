		<content>  The Craft Centre at{Thorpe in Balne  
 is  big.In a corner is a table with   
 leather work on it.The leather workman
 has made the things that are on       
 display on the table.There are        
 bookmarks, wallets, purses, penknife  
 holders and lots more.Next to the     
 leather table is a long shelf with    
 things made of herbs like lavender    
 bags and some things to make a        
 headache go away using cooked herbs.  
  On the other side of the herb shelf  
 are little ornaments made of shells   
 and stones that are painted.As you go 
 upstairs there is a pair of horns.On  
 the top floor there are a lot of      
 things to buy.Most of them were cuddly
 toys and some of them were for        
 sale.Next to the toys was a table     
 covered with knitted clothes.
