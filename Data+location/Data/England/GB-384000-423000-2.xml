		<title>02Bacup _ an interesting place</title>
		<content> On the road to Burnley(A671) there is 
 a building of historic interest _ an  
 old{GENT'S TOILET.}It is on the corner
 of Dog Pits Lane,Broadclough and was  
 probably built for the use of workmen 
 at the nearby mill or quarry.         
       On Yorkshire Street,in front of 
 the Health Centre,stand the stocks.   
 They were found in 1974 by workmen    
 digging in Tong Lane. They could take 
 two offenders. Alongside is a         
 grind_stone. It came originally from  
 Sower Hall Quarry near Todmorden and  
 was used to crush sandstone into sand.
       The town is said to have the    
 smallest street in England. It is     
 Elgin Street and has only one house it
 is so short.                          
       From our study it is clear that 
 Bacup grew rapidly in the hundred or  
 so years before World War One.
