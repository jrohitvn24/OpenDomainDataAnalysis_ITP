		<title>01Weald S of Oakwood Hill</title>
		<content> This is a mixture of farmland and     
 woodland, the only settlements being  
 Wallis Wood and the tiny hamlet of    
 Oakwood Hill with its cricket club and
 pub widely famed for good food.       
 Outside these the population is       
 virtually limited to the occupants of 
 various farmhouses which are the      
 prominent feature of the landscape.   
 Several of these are very old and very
 fine, much extended and improved over 
 the years, and suggest an income not  
 confined to farming.   The farming is 
 mostly pasture with sheep             
 predominating, but there is also a    
 fair amount of arable.   In the woods 
 there are pheasants, some of them     
 reared, and a few wild deer.   This is
 border country, ie the now little used
  "border path" between Sussex and     
 Surrey runs through east west.
