		<content> There is a splendid walk down the     
 fields by{Eastcote Lane.}There is a   
 stream about two metres wide and by it
 a piece of rope tied to a tree. You   
 can hold the rope and swing across.   
 Another lane leads to the{River Blythe
 and a lake. Down this lane the railway
 goes over a bridge known as the       
{"Cuckoo Bridge".}If you go under it   
 and turn right you will see a footpath
 which leads to woodland. There are    
 quite a few animals there. On the     
 right, before the river, you can walk 
 to a lake. There are swans, geese and 
 an island of grass in the middle. In  
 the summer people swim in the lake.   
 There is a smaller lake near it which 
 has fish and frogs, also an island in 
 the middle but the water is slimy.
