		<title>09A Local Vicar's typical day</title>
		<content>   We visited the Rev. Neville Kent,   
 vicar of Bradford, Hillfarrance, Oake,
 and Heathfield parishes. He showed us 
 round Bradford and Hillfarrance       
 Churches and talked about a typical   
 day in his life.                      
   In the morning he gets up and has   
 his breakfast.  After he goes to      
 church and says his prayers, he sees  
 that everything is in an orderly      
 fashion.  He then sits down and writes
 letters to people, prepares services  
 or takes assembly at Oake School.     
   In the afternoon he goes to visit   
 people in hospital or in an old       
 peoples' home.  In the evening he has 
 to go to meetings which go on for a   
 long time.                            
   So, if you think a vicar just sits  
 in a chair and rests all day and takes
 a service on a Sunday you are wrong.  
 He is a very busy person.             </content>
