      Without the village hall,        
 community activies within the village 
 would be severely curtailed if not    
 well nigh impossible. The remoteness  
 of the village would become far more  
 evident and the community would       
 naturally look outside the village to 
 fill the social gap.                  
      After twenty-five years of       
 weathering the hall roof is beginning 
 to leak badly. Again, with help from  
 the County Council, the villagers have
 raised the Â£4200 needed for repairs in
 a remarkably short time. Money is     
 being collected through raffles,      
 coffee evenings, sponsored events and 
 donations. Even the schoolchildren    
 have helped by giving a concert.
