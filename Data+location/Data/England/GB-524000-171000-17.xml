		<title>17Inside Wimbledon Tennis</title>
		<content>Traditionally Wimbledon fortnight means
hot, sunny June days,but often the     
reality is different.Whatever the      
weather, tourists eat the expensive    
but delicious strawberries and cream,  
with cool refreshing iced coffee,in the
blue and white tents. Inside the dark  
green gates of the tennis world "oohs" 
and "aahs" and enthusiastic clapping   
are heard when a tennis player makes a 
daring dive for a hard ball.There is   
always a buzz of noise.It is only when 
you are seated in Centre Court that    
there is absolute silence.To sit in    
Centre Court you must either own a     
debenture seat or have bought one      
through the pools or queue all night.  
Much easier is to walk leisurely at 5  
o'clock avoiding all traffic to pay    
two or three pounds to enable you to   
enter the grounds and then spend long  
lovely evenings of splendid tennis.    </content>
