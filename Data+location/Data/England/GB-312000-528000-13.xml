		<title>13On Saturdays (1) by Alan</title>
		<content> On Saturdays I get up at half-past    
 eight.  I go to the bathroom, get     
 washed and go downstairs. Whilst      
 my mum gets breakfast I read the      
 newspaper and "Shoot", which is a     
 magazine about football.              
 I always have a big breakfast of      
 mushrooms, tinned tomatoes, egg and   
 bread because I play football in the  
 afternoon.  I go out to play football 
 on the park and then come in for a    
 sandwich.  Then I go to play with my  
 team.                                 
 If we are going to play away we meet  
 in Main Street, but if we are at      
 home we meet at the Highfield ground. 
 I take the kits because my mam washes 
 them.  They are white shirts with blue
 shorts and socks. You have to be under
 twelve years to be in the League      
 and I am the youngest.  I am a        
 striker.                              </content>
