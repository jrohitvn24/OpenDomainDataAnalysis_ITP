		<content> A parked vehicle survey.              
 There were more cars parked in the    
 afternoon than in the morning - 43 in 
 the morning and 56 in the afternoon.  
 These are all the vehicles that were  
 parked in Hartington, cars, vans,     
 lorries, tractor, coaches. There were 
 more vehicles parked in the afternoon 
 as lots of people come to look round  
 the village.                          
 We did a survey to find out how people
 went out of Hartington. Our survey was
 for 15 minutes on Monday, Tuesday,    
 Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. People
 walked, cycled, went in cars, vans and
 lorries. Most people travelled out on 
 Wednesday. The least number of people 
 travelled out on Friday.              
 Most people travelled out in cars.
