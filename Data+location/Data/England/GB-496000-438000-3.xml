		<content> The College of Agriculture operates a 
{Youth Training Scheme (YTS)}offering  
 broad-based training in life skills   
 with specific emphasis on agriculture 
 or horticulture or related subjects.  
 There are 230 trainees, many of whom  
 go on to full-time courses at the     
 College. The YTS programme has meant  
 increased resources and staff being   
 available to the College but has meant
 a move away from County to national   
 financing. Newly redeveloped in 1985, 
{The Croft}is a rural skills unit for  
 children with special needs. It also  
 acts as a teaching centre for visiting
 school parties. About 75 handicapped  
 people attend the unit each week which
 is run by 3 full-time staff and has   
 cows, calves, ponies, ducks, goats and
 chickens. Several hundred children    
 visit the college per week and 2000   
 children come to a{Schools Open Day.  </content>
