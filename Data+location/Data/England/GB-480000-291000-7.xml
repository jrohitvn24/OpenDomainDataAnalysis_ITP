		<title>07Medbourne, Drayton Councils.</title>
		<content> Medbourne Parish Council consists of  
 five village members, one of whom is  
 Chairman plus a clerk to the council  
 who does not have voting powers. They 
 meet on the first Monday of the month 
 for discussions on local issues but   
 they may only advise the Harborough   
 District Council or Leicestershire    
 County Council of the views of the    
 village - they have no real powers.   
 Drayton and Nevill Holt are not large 
 enough to have an elected parish      
 council but a village council meet    
 once or twice a year conducted by the 
 Chairman and Secretary to perform     
 almost the same duties. Medbourne have
 also appointed a tree warden who is   
 responsible to the County Council.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
