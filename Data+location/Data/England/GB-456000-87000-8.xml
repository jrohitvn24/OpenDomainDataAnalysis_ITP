		<title>08The Gatehouse at Ashey</title>
		<content>{ The Gatehouse}was built in the late  
 1500s.The residents of the house now  
 are Mr and Mrs Beak,who have lived    
 there for  23 years.In the house they 
 only have oil and electric heating,but
 no gas.There are 14 rooms including a 
 five room granny flat. A couple of    
 years ago they repaired the roof,and  
 modernised the bathroom and kitchen.  
  Mr and Mrs Beak have 180 acres of    
 land and have 494{animals:}100 cows,50
 calves,250 pigs,40 hens,40 ducks,12   
 cats,1 pony and a dog.                
  They have got one of the most modern 
 milking parlours on the Island.They   
 produce 1000 gallons of milk a day so 
 they have been upset at the reduction 
 in quotas forced on them by the E.E.C.
  They get up at 6.00 in the morning,  
 and finish at 7.00 in the evening.
