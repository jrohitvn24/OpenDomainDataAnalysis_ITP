		<title>15Population, N. Lopham</title>
		<content>      We did a mini-survey of school-  
 children's families, to see how many  
 were N. Lopham 'natives'.             
      Asking where mothers came from,  
 we found that the families were       
 fairly equally divided - about 1/3    
 coming from N. Lopham, 1/3 from       
 elsewhere in E. Anglia, 1/3 from      
 outside E. Anglia.  However, asking   
 where fathers came from, only one was 
 a North Lopham native.  About 1/4 came
 from outside East Anglia and the vast 
 majority came from elsewhere in East  
 Anglia.  Aparently our mothers like to
 stay in their home village to         
 bring up their own children, but the  
 fathers are more mobile.  When it came
 to grandparents of school-children,   
 fewer than 1/5 had 'native' g'parents 
 on the father's side, compared with   
 well over 1/3 on the mother's side, so
 this shows the same trend.            </content>
