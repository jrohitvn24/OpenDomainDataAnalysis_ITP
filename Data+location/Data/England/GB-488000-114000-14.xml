		<title>14LOCAL HISTORY - S.DOWNS</title>
		<content>    The S.Downs has a long history     
 stretching back to the far off days of
 prehistoric man &amp; much of interest    
 remains for the archaeologists to     
 discover about their way of life.     
    Traces of early settlements along  
 the ancient paths on top of the downs 
 show signs of round huts surrounded by
 banks &amp; ditches with banked enclosures
 for animals nearby. Many have now been
 ploughed over, but their sites are    
 marked on older maps as "tumuli". At  
 least 4 such sites can be found on the
 downs between Heyshott &amp; Graffham.    
    Later, people made settlements     
 lower down the southern slopes. They  
 surrounded their huts with square     
 fields outlined by lynchets, or banks,
 which can still often be identified &amp; 
 are marked on maps as "Field systems".
 e.g.at the S.E.edge of sq.8.
