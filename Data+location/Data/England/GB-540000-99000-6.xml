 We entered the Co-op and went through 
 the automatic doors.  The security    
 guard kept walking away from our group
 but we managed to catch up with him.  
 He told us the manager wasn't there so
 we talked to the assistant manager    
 instead.  His name was Mr. Goldspink. 
 The office was behind the shop.  They 
 started planning Home-maker 7 years   
 ago.  They built it because they      
 thought it necessary.  There is no    
 more going to be built.  Special      
 Saturday student staff are employed.  
 He employs about 250 staff and there  
 are more women than men.  There is a  
 special security department.  After   
 closing time they employ staff to fill
 the shelves.  The annual turnover is  
 15 million pounds.  The starting      
 salary is Â£50 - Â£55 a week for new    
 staff.                                </content>
