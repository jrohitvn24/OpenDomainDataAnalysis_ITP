		<content> We have found that the South End of   
 Roos is the most modern.This area has 
 been developed over the past 15 years.
 Prior to this it was mainly open      
 fields.Any buildings were linked to   
 the fsrms.This part of Roos has many  
 small woods and mature trees.The South
 End has the only religious buildings  
 (church and oratory) left in the      
 village.Originally there were two     
 chapels,but they have been knocked    
 down over the past decade.The village 
 seems to be seperated from its        
 Northend.Northend is almost a village 
 in itself.There is a high proportion  
 of farms at the Northend,this reflects
 the rural aspect of the village.Most  
 of the houses are pre-war and some are
 very much older.The majority of houses
 are large and detached,separated from 
 eachother by fields.
