		<title>16Hemerdon - Galva Road.</title>
		<content>   Near the top of Galva Road there was
 a gateway and path over the moor      
 leading to Hemerdon Mine. The fields  
 on both sides of the road were rough  
 grazing. Plymouth was visible.        
   Further down we saw an old mine     
 chimney and nearby was a large house  
 called Galva House. The fields on     
 either side were now used for crops.  
   We came to a barn that used to house
 animals but has been converted to     
 garages and belongs to the house      
 across the road. Near it is a grit box
 to use on icy roads. Then we came to  
 Carthew House and Stert Farm. In the  
 farmyard was farm machinery but it is 
 also a dairy farm. Opposite the farm  
 was an old cottage which is part of   
 Ploughlands Riding Stables. Some      
 children from Sparkwell School go     
 riding there.
