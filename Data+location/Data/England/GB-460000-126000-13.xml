		<title>13Bramdean Village Policeman</title>
		<content> The village policeman works from his  
 home in the village, and although     
 attached to a Police Station in the   
 nearest town, he usually works alone, 
 looking after about four parishes.    
 The policeman is responsible for the  
 investigation of crime, for preventing
 crime by patrolling on foot or        
 motorcycle, and for giving advice to  
 property owners.  He also deals with  
 road accidents, investigates sudden   
 deaths, issues firearms licences,     
 teaches road safety in schools,       
 intervenes in violent domestic        
 disputes, checks the conduct of public
 houses, and performs many other varied
 tasks. There is an office at his house
 where people may call when in need of 
 help or advice.  When the policeman is
 off duty, although he can be contacted
 at home if necessary, his beat is     
 covered by a patrolling car.          </content>
