		<content> IN A SAMPLE OF EIGHT SILVER BIRCH     
 TREES IN THE NATURE RESERVE AT        
 FRESHFIELD THE CIRCUMFERENCE VARIED   
 FROM 20CM TO 65CM. ALL BUT TWO OF THE 
 TREES HAD A CIRCUMFERENCE OF 40CM OR  
 MORE. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN            
 NEIGHBOURING TREES VARIED BETWEEN 60CM
 AND 335CM. ONLY ONE PAIR OF TREES WAS 
 SEPARATED BY A DISTANCE OF MORE THAN  
 160CM AND THREE PAIRS WERE SEPARATED  
 BY A DISTANCE OF 80CM OR LESS.        
 IN A SQUARE METRE AROUND AN OLD TREE  
 STUMP WE FOUND TWO SMALL PIECES OF    
 PAPER, MOSS, TREE BARK, THE REMAINS OF
 A PINE CONE, PINE NEEDLE CLUSTERS,    
 GRASS, A MONEY SPIDER, TWIGS AND      
 WOODLICE. THE PAPER AND THE CHOPPED   
 DOWN TREE WERE EVIDENCE OF HUMAN      
 ACTIVITY AND THE PINE CONE REMAINS    
 SHOWED THAT SQUIRRELS HAD BEEN BUSY.
