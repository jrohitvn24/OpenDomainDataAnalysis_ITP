		<title>20CHALFONTS AREA SUMMARY</title>
		<content>3 schools in our area have participated
in the D.P.. The schools being Jordans 
School,Lovel End County First School   
and Chalfont St. Peter C.E. Middle.    
After an initial meeting,interviews    
were arranged with local people and all
three schools would like to thank      
anyone who has given freely of their   
time, in helping us with the quick and 
thorough completion of the project.    
Particular thanks go to the three      
teachers involved, Miss Davies, Mrs    
Smith and Miss Stockwell and a special 
mention should be made to Mr. W. Brown 
of C.S.P. Middle School,who has had the
unenviable job of co-ordinating the    
computing side of the project. Thanks  
must also go to a small group of boys  
in his class who have been an enormous 
asset whilst information has been typed
onto the disc.                         
                                       </content>
