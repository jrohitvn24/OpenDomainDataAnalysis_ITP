		<title>13The Arts in Pontefract.</title>
		<content> Pontefract can supply a large variety 
 of Clubs and Societies which range    
 from the traditional Rotary Clubs to  
 the Hi-Tec computer and photographic  
 societies.The town's theatrical needs 
 are amply provided for by the St.Giles
 with St.Mary's Pantomime/Theatrical   
 Society.Pontefract is the venue for an
 annual music festival which is held in
 the Town Hall every May.The schools in
 the area compete in many different    
 classes ranging from solos to wind    
 groups.The local library provides an  
 excellent service and also acts as an 
 Art Gallery in which local schools and
 societies can set up displays.The     
 Museum set up in the last decade      
 already has a fine collection of      
 historical artifacts and acts as a    
 host to exhibits of more recent times 
 such as holographic projections.
