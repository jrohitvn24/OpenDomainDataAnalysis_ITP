		<title>12Beckingham(Lincs)Post Office</title>
		<content>  The Post Office is situated almost in
 the  centre of the village on Sleaford
 Road  and  has operated from the  same
 cottage for the last 52 years.        
 The Post Office  also  includes  small
 general stores  which  means that most
 of  the  villagers  visit  the  office
 fairly regularly to  do  business  and
 have a chat.                          
 The opening hours are from nine to one
 and  from two  until five_thirty  with
 half  day  closing  on  Wednesday  and
 Saturday.                             
 Most of the services  offered  by  the
 general   town     post-offices    are
 available at this post office although
 it  is  not  possible  to issue  motor
 vehicle   taxation   licences  at  the
 present  time.                        
 The general stores offers a wide range
 of goods and  is  much  used  by those
 who have difficulty getting to town.  </content>
