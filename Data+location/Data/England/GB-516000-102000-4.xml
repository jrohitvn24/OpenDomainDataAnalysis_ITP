		<content> I live in Chester Avenue and nearly   
 every day I play football.I go over   
 the field to kick the football about  
 or I go in goal.I sometimes ride about
 on my bike around church walk and in  
 ten acres or otherwise I go around my 
 street. Sometimes I go to brooklands  
 on my bike so that I can go on the BMX
 track and enjoy myself.I sometimes go 
 in the adventure playground but not   
 often.In the playground they have got 
 swings a wooden house with a tunnel   
 and more.I sometimes go down to Home, 
 field park and go on the swings.I     
 sometimes go down to the beach for a  
 swim I sometimes take lunch too, but  
 not often. On Saturday I am always    
 with my friends at the field or in ten
 acres.
