		<content>  Today there are many fashionable     
 clothes. At the moment the craze is   
 flower power for girls and famous     
 jumpers such as Kappa's for boys. Also
 a lot of boys wear trainers such as   
 Puma, Nike,Diadora and Dunlop.        
 Tracksuits such as Fila, Rochini and  
 Tochini are also worn.                
 Girls wear baggy trousers and shirts  
 with flat jelly shoes and bags. They  
 also wear brightly fluorescent        
 coloured socks,gloves,nailvarnish and 
 ribbons.                              
 Still however, a lot of the sixty's   
 fashions are repeated. Flairs will    
 soon be back in fashion but I promise 
 that you won't catch me wearing them.
