		<title>04NEWBURY RACECOURSE</title>
		<content>  Newbury racecourse is opposite Stroud
 Green. It is a very large racecourse  
 and races are held on most Saturdays  
 and sometimes on Mondays and Tuesdays.
 It is quite a well known racecourse   
 and some of the many races held there 
 are on television. Many famous jockeys
 have raced there including Leicester  
 Piggot and Willy Carson.              
 It is common to see Royalty at        
 meetings.                             
 The people of the area do get a little
 fed up with the problems of traffic   
 caused by the races, and object to    
 being forced off the road by Rolls    
 Royces and BMWs. The people who attend
 the meetings appear to be in a world  
 of their own. There is some employment
 created by the Racecourse.
