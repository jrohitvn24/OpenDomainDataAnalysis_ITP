		<title>14INDUSTRIES IN HOLYMOORSIDE</title>
		<content>    There have been many industries in 
 Holymoorside. Before motorized        
 transport a successful{Blacksmith}    
 shop existed. Around 1820 a{Wheelright
 shop was opened. Other agricultural   
 equipment made locally included{      
{barrels}and{butterchurns.}            
                                       
    For several centuries processes    
 connected with{lead smelting}were     
 carried out. The local sandstones are 
 of good quality and so Holymoorside   
 had a thriving{quarrying}industry.    
                                       
    Today{farming}is the largest       
 industry in the area. However the     
 manufacture of{besoms}and{brooms}from 
 local heather and birch still exists. 
 The heather is gathered together and  
 tied around a central birch stake to  
 make good quality besoms.
