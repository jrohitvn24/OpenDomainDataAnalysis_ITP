		<title>05BRANCEPETH</title>
		<content> In contrast to the large estates in   
 Brandon, Brancepeth is a small village
 which has a castle,church, old village
 cottages,and,since 1975, some very    
 exclusively designed houses on 3 small
 private developments, making a total  
 of 68 houses, all private, in the     
 village.The station has also closed.Oh
 yes,at the crossroads there is a very 
 famous "conker"(horse chestnut) tree  
 which is raided every year by small   
 boys for the very special "conkers".  
 Few villagers have lived here all     
 their lives. They thought Brancepeth  
 was important because of the castle   
 and the golf course. There was once a 
 cricket field near the station but the
 owners did not renew the lease hoping 
 to sell the land for building houses  
 on.Villagers protested but to no      
 avail.                                
                                       </content>
