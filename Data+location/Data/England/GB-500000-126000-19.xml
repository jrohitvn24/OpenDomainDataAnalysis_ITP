		<content>   The'Degradation of Drunkenness'is on
 the wall of the original vicarage.It  
 was put there by a vicar in the late  
 19th century to warn his parishioners.
   'There is no sin which doth more    
 deface Gods image than drunkenness it 
 disguiseth a person and doth even     
 unman him.Drunkenness makes him have  
 the throat of a fish,the belly of a   
 swine and the head of an ass.         
 Drunkenness is the shame of nature,   
 the extinguisher of reason,the        
 shipwreck of chastity and the murderer
 of conscience.Drunkenness is hurtful  
 to the body,the cup kills more than   
 the cannon,it causes dropsies,        
 catarrhs,apoplexies it fills the eye  
 with fire,and the legs with water and 
 turns the body into a hospital'.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
