		<title>15Home Life, St Ives</title>
		<content> Home life in St Ives, in common with  
 the rest of the country, has undergone
 a tremendous change in the last       
 few decades.                          
                                       
 With the advent of technology most    
 homes have many labour saving devices,
 particularly those used by the        
 housewife. These have become necessary
 because more women go out to work now 
 than was the case. Baby minders and   
 playgroups are readily available      
 meaning that women are no longer tied 
 to the house by children. This has    
 brought about greater independence for
 women as well as helping the families 
 to buy homes of their own. The home   
 life of children has also changed     
 dramatically. They no longer need to  
 make their own entertainment as most  
 houses have one or two TV sets and a  
 video recorder.                       </content>
