		<content>   Geoffrey Smith is a well-known      
 local and national TV and radio per-  
 sonality, featuring in such programmes
 as "Mr. Smith's World of Flowers" and 
 "Gardener's Question Time," and the   
 author of a string of best-selling    
 gardening books.                      
   Although from Swaledale, he has     
 lived in this area for almost 30      
 years, being for many years the head  
 of the Northern Horticultural Soc-    
 iety's Gardens at Harlow Carr, Harro- 
 gate, before venturing into broad-    
 casting.                              
   He thoroughly enjoys living in the  
 area, caring passionately about the   
 local environment, which he feels has 
 remained generally unspoilt, though   
 constant vigilence must be maintained 
 in regard to agricultural building.   
   All in all, he feels it to be a     
 "cracking place to live."             </content>
