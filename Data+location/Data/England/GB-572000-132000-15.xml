		<title>15RIDING IN BEDGEBURY AREA</title>
		<content>   It is an exhilarating experience to 
 ride in Bedgebury Forest, with its    
 1500 acres of coniferous and deciduous
 trees, intersected by unmetalled roads
 with many tracks leading from them.   
 These have broad grass verges where   
 many different wild flowers grow.  As 
 the Forest is closed to unauthorized  
 vehicles this makes it a particularly 
 safe and pleasant place to ride.      
   The number of horses allowed to use 
 this Forestry Commission land is      
 restricted to permit holders only, at 
 Â£20 per horse per annum.  This ensures
 that the horses are kept to a suitable
 number with no overcrowding or damage 
 to this lovely area.                  
   Bedgebury School has an accredited  
 riding centre where pupils and public 
 can learn to ride and study for the   
 British Horse Society's Assistant     
 Instructor qualification.             </content>
