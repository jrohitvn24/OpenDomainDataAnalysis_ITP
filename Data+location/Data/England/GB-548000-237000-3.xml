		<content>   The oldest building is "The Gate    
 House" which was built in 1260.The    
 chimneys are Elizabethan and the      
 existing roof was built in 1560.The   
 house's main feature is its raised    
 aisled hall.There is one main farm in 
 Littlebury,Mill Farm.The farmer who   
 owns it grows wheat,barley and        
 oil-seed-rape.The animals he owns are 
 cows and a few sheep.                 
   On interviewing some of the people  
 in the village we found that most of  
 them thought the 1 shop in Littlebury 
 quite sufficient,but some of them do  
 their shopping in the nearby towns and
 cities:Saffron Walden, Cambridge,     
 Bishop's Stortford, Harlow and London.
 Most of the people who do travel do so
 by car,train or bus.
