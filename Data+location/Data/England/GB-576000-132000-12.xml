		<content> Various hygienic measures ensure      
 healthy surroundings for the cows at  
 Forest Farm. These include            
 vaccinations against various diseases,
 neutralization of urea and the        
 extensive use of disinfectants. The   
 herd is given annual tuberculosis     
 tests, any cow found to have this     
 disease is immediately destroyed.     
 Another disease which is common       
 amongst dairy cows is mastitis and a  
 test for this is carried out as soon  
 as a cow has calved. Infected milk    
 congeals and this is shown up by a    
 black dish.To prevent mastitis        
 spreading a new paper is used to wipe 
 down the udder of each cow before and 
 after milking. foot disease has been a
 problem on the damp ground but now,   
 the cows are subjected to regular foot
 baths of formalin. Cows are put into  
 separate cubicles and excreta removed.</content>
