		<title>20TRANSPORT MOTORWAY AT LUTON</title>
		<content>On Tuesday June 25 at 2.pm a group of  
children stood on the foot bridge near 
Foxdell Junior School to count the cars
on the motorway.  The nearest junction 
for cars to get on to  and off the     
motorway is at Dunstable Road. The     
motorway goes from London to Leeds. For
10 minutes from 2.05 to 2.15 they      
counted the cars, there were 185 going 
north and 159 going south.  The        
motorway might have been quieter than  
usual because of the roadworks at      
junction 8. These were major works and 
were expected to cause congestion, so  
many people may have found another     
route.                                 
Pedestrians and learners are not       
allowedon the motorway and the speed   
limit is 70mph.                        
The schools which have produced these  
pages of information are Downside Jnr.,
St.Mary's Lower, and Rotheram High.    </content>
