 In Folksworth there is a pub and a    
 farm.The pub is called the Fox and    
 there are houses. Most of them are    
 detached houses.There are 2 big       
 houses 1 is owned by Jed Ford and I   
 don't know the other.There is a church
 at the end of the village.The farm is 
 owned by Bob Castle and the shop is   
 owned by Jack. There is a playing     
 field and a pond that the ducks go in 
 and sometimes a heron.There is a wood 
 and a great big heap of mud called the
 mound. About 1 mile away there is a   
 round_a_bout called Norman Cross and  
 thats where there used to be a prison 
 camp.
