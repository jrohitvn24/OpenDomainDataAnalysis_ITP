		<title>14Young Farmers' Club</title>
		<content>    {Rusland Young Farmers}raise money 
 for charities like the St. John's     
 Ambulance Brigade. Usually they meet  
 once a week in the Parish Room. They  
 hold a concert each year at{Grizedale 
{Theatre}which raises about 300 pounds 
 or more; they also have whist drives a
 few times a year and discos and       
 mystery trips too. There is a tea     
 afternoon for the OAPs which is well  
 attended.                             
                                       
    Once a year the Young Farmers have 
 a field day when there are            
 competitions like running, building   
 walls, flower arranging, football,    
 stock judging and sheep shearing.     
 There are points for each competition;
 afterwards these are added up and     
 there is a shield for the winner.
