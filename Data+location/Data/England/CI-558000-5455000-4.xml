		<title>04La Mare Vineyard-Interview</title>
		<content>   We went to La Mare Vineyard to      
 interview Mrs. Blaney. She said that  
 she pressed the grapes to make wine   
 but did not put anything in the wine  
 apart from grapes. Then she told us   
 that she had four varieties of        
 grapes. Seyval, Reichensteiner,       
 Schonburger and Scheurebe. She also   
 added that the vineyard was six and a 
 half acres and that they had just     
 planted another acre.                 
   She then told us that she had       
 delivered wine as far away as Iceland 
 and that her house was built in 1797. 
 She also told us that she grew cider  
 apples and had an acre of the orchards
 for them. She said that she still used
 an old-fashioned press for the apples 
 but not for the grapes and added that 
 the grapes called Huxelrebe and       
 Reichensteiner made the best wine.
