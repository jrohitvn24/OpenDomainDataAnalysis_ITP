		<content>   The first feature confronting you in
 this beautiful country village is     
 Rowsley Bridge,crossing the Derwent   
 River.It is interesting to note that  
 the bridge was widened in 1925 to     
 accomodate the A6.There are three     
 other bridges,Beeley Bridge,Wye Bridge
 and the railway viaduct.              
   Not far from Beeley Bridge lies the 
 only piece of historical interest in  
 the village,Caudwell's Mill,built in  
 1851.                                 
   The village has one inn,called the  
 Peacock Hotel,and one public house,   
 called the Grouse and Claret, which   
 was converted from a Victorian house. 
   Rowsley is a busy community and has 
 very little to offer the tourists     
 apart from its beauty.                
   The village has only one shop,the   
 Post Office and General Store,which   
 caters for most needs of the villagers</content>
