		<content> First we went to Spittlehouse Farm and
 found out that it is not a farm       
 anymore-it is a food catering firm!   
 Mr.Priestly gave us information       
 about how he runs it.He also told us  
 that another farmer called Mr.Rose had
 bought some acres from him.We went to 
 a small holding called Wetlands which 
 is owned by a woman.She said she had  
 been farming for 37 years.We also     
 visited Grange Farm and talked to the 
 owner.He said that he enjoyed working 
 in agriculture.His farm was mixed,with
 both arable and dairy farming.He grows
 barley,potatoes and turnips, and      
 keeps a Freisian and Jersey herd.He   
 also has 40 ewes and 60 lambs.The farm
 has 156 acres.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
