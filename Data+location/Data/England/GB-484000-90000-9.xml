		<title>09THE EVERGREEN CLUB OF SELSEY</title>
		<content>    The{Evergreen Club}is a social club
 which also provides outings and       
 holidays. It was started 15-20 years  
 ago,and it was named the Evergreen    
 Club because they felt that it's very 
 young at heart.There are about{600    
{members},more women than men and it's 
 run by a committee.Although there's no
 age limit it's mostly for the over    
 60s.It costs Â£1.00 a year to belong.  
 The club depends on the{Venture Club  
 for transport and they give them a    
 donation every year.They hire the     
 parish hall some afternoons for bingo 
 and whist-drives where they have tea  
 and biscuits and a raffle.On Friday   
 afternoons they meet at Manhood       
 Community College Youthwing where they
 can play snooker,darts,table tennis   
 and other games.They have about 20    
 coach outings and 2 holidays a year   
 which the members pay for.            </content>
