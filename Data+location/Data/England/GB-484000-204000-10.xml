		<content>{RIGHTS OF WAY AROUND DUNSMORE         
 The area can offer may beautiful paths
 and bridleways walked often by local  
 Ramblers' Ass. to preserve the rights 
 of way. The Upper Inknield Way borders
 the Chilterns and there is a parallel 
 track at a higher level, presumably   
 for bad weather use, part of which is 
 included in The Ridgeway long distance
 path, stretching 85mls from Avebury,  
 Wilts to Ivinghoe Beacon, Herts.      
 Backpackers are usualy seen, but the  
 variety of the hill and valley, far   
 views over the Vale of Aylesbury,     
 attract not only the local people but 
 a greater numbers of casual walkers   
 from London and beyond. The criss,    
 crossing waymarked tracks lead through
 woods and farmland onto Coombe Hill,  
 giving freedom to wander on the grassy
 summit, and the bridleways give ample 
 off_road riding for local stables.    </content>
