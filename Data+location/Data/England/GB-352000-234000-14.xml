		<title>14BULL TESTING STATION 2</title>
		<content> When the bulls arrive they are penned 
 in cribs in{groups of 2 or 3}and weigh
{200 to 300 kg.  }After 3 months they  
 are{penned individually.  }When the   
 testing is over, they weigh between   
{500 and 700 kg,}depending on their    
 breed.   There are{Herefords          
 (English),{Charolais and Limousin     
 (French),{Simontal}(Austrian),{Murray 
{Greys}(Australian),{Welsh Black       
 (Wales),{Belgian Blue}(South Devon),  
 and{Sussex. Continental breeds}are    
 becoming{more popular}because they    
{grow quicker}and eventually put on    
{more weight}than the British breeds.  
 The bulls eat as much as they like -  
 their{food}is in{pellets,}made from a 
{mixture of dry grass and barley}- and 
 big bulls{eat about 14kg a day.  }They
 are{assessed on}their{weight}after{400
{days.  }They are all inspected by a   
 vet,for disease, when they arrive.    </content>
