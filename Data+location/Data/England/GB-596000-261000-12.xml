		<title>12DAIRY FARMING WOOLPIT</title>
		<content> We visited Mr. Coddington's dairy     
 farm. Altogether there are 270 cattle.
 There are 99 milking Jerseys. 14 cows 
 are milked at a time. On the day we   
 visited, one cow gave 14 kg. in the   
 morning and 9 kg. in the afternoon.   
 The milk tanker collects the milk at  
 8.00 a.m. The tanker holds 1,916 kg.  
 84 cows sleep in cubicles on rubber   
 mats. The rest sleep in straw yards.  
 One cow has a ring in her nose because
 she sucks milk from other cows. The   
 bull is three years old and his name  
 is Sam. The cows calve in September.  
 They have an eight-week rest before   
 calving. Then they are milked for the 
 next 305 days.                        
 Mr. Isaac's farm, near Tostock.    My 
 Dad is stockman. The farm has a       
 Charolais herd. The champion bull is  
 called Royal. My Dad takes him for    
 walks every day.                      </content>
