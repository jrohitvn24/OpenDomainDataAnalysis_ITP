		<title>19HISTORY OF BRIERTON</title>
		<content> In 1938 a mammoth bone was found at   
 Brierton Quarry, only one year after  
 men digging for sand had discovered   
 Saxon graves.                         
 No record of Brierton appeared in the 
 Domesday Book.However a survey of 1543
 showed Brierton surrounded by Dalton &amp;
 Tunstall to the north, Owton to the   
 east and Stotfold to the west. The    
 survey also shows  the 3 Field System 
 in operation. The farms were later    
 rented and from 1700 the rents were   
 used to support Kirkleatham School    
 near Redcar. About this time the 3    
 Field System disappeared and today's 3
 farms were created. Since that time   
 new houses and bungalows have been    
 built but the basic character of the  
 area has changed very little, despite 
 the enormous growth of nearby         
 Hartlepool.
