		<content> Bodle Street Green Village Hall is    
 used on a weekly basis by the recently
 formed Play Group and for monthly     
 meetings of the Women's Institute and 
 the Gardening Club.  In Ashburnham the
 sporting events seem endless with Keep
 Fit/Aerobics in the village hall and  
 two Badminton Clubs  who also use     
 the Hall. You can join a mixed league 
 or ladies Stool Ball team, play Sunday
 cricket and for the very sturdy, tug  
 of war. Cubs are a thriving           
 organisation but Guides and Scouts    
 have recently disbanded through lack  
 of support. A clay pigeon shooting    
 club has recently been formed in Brown
 Bread Street for weekly shoots.       
 Local rough pasture is used for motor 
 cycle scrambling and trials.There are 
 therefore a whole range of activities 
 for every age group.
