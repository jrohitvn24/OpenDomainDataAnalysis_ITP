		<title>18Dry-Stone Walls.</title>
		<content> Dry-stone walls using the abundant    
 local stone, are a feature of many    
 fields in North Northumberland. They  
 are called 'dykes'locally.            
 A shallow trench is dug where the wall
 is to be built. The builder starts    
 with his stones in two courses-side by
 side, with the smoother faces outwards
 and sloping slightly inwards for      
 stability.  The vertical joints are   
 staggered and all gaps filled with    
 chosen fragments, the builder         
 maintaining his level throughout using
 a string line.                        
 The wall tapers from the base upwards 
 and is topped with large stones set   
 vertically.                           
 No cement or mortar is used and the   
 only tools are a hammer and a string  
 line.
