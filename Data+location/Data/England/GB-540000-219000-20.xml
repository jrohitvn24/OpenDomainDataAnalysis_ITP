 famous residents is Henry Moore, the  
 sculptor, who lives at "Hoglands"     
 Perry Green.There is a stone carving  
 made by Henry Moore at the West door  
 of the parish church.The Govenor of   
 the Bank of England from 1920-1944,   
 Lord Norman lived at Moor Place and   
 his family still lives there to this  
 day.                                  
   The village is considered a very    
 desirable place in which to live and  
 consequently property is expensive.   
   The village Fete is held annually on
 August Bank Holiday and raises on     
 average about Â£4,500.The money is used
 for the improvement and maintainance  
 of village facilities. The villagers  
 are proud of their village and view   
 with sadness the inevitable changes   
 which take place in society.          </content>
