		<title>11An adults life in Stithians</title>
		<content> Our school caretaker, married         
 with two daughters and a son, has     
 lived in{Stithians}all his life.      
 As a child he knew everyone in        
 the village, but now there  are       
 so many outsiders he does not         
 know everyone. However he likes       
 meeting people at work. Like many     
 people {in Stithians,}our caretaker   
 gets up at about 7:15am. First he     
 takes his daughter to Redruth where   
 she works as a receptionist and his   
 wife down to {Ponsanooth}where she    
 works with  computers at a civil      
 engineering company. Then  he takes   
 his youngest daughter to  Stithians   
 school.  He keeps pigeons for a hobby 
 and he puts them into races from as   
 far away as Luxembourg.  He sometimes 
 goes into the pub, The Seven Stars,   
 while he waits to lock up the{school  
  after a meeting or a practice.       </content>
