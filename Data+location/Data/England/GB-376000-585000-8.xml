		<content> The school was opened in 1966 to      
 replace 2 schools at Hott and         
 Thorneyburn. There are 13 children,   
 rising to 18 in September and they    
 range in age from 4-9 years. They     
 travel up to 7 miles by school car    
 from Falstone, Donkleywood, High Green
 and Carriteth Cottage. The majority   
 live in isolated homes. The staff     
 comprises; the headteacher, assistant 
 teacher, cook/supervisor, cleaner in  
 charge and clerk. Children work       
 happily alongside each other in a     
 stimulating family atmosphere. For    
 most 3 R work they are taught in 2    
 groups ranging in age from 4-6 and 7-9
 years. Because the groups are small   
 the teachers are able to cater for    
 individual needs. The school has      
 almost an acre of ground including a  
 pond, playground, natural area and    
 trees many planted by the children.   </content>
