		<content>{Redenham}village is situated in this  
 square, an attractive{village         
 consisting mainly of brick and flint  
{cottages,}several beautiful old       
 thatched{houses}and other less ancient
 houses.                               
                                       
 Most have their own large gardens,    
 often beautifully cared for, providing
 flowers and vegetables for their      
 owners.  There is an attractive{public
{house}called the 'Dog and Gun'.       
                                       
 The area is criss-crossed by many     
 small{roads}and tracks.  A derelict   
{school}is situated at one junction,   
 symbol of the decline in stable       
 population and the general movement of
 younger people to towns for employment
 and the difficulty of maintaining     
{schools}with a small number on roll by
 local rates.                          </content>
