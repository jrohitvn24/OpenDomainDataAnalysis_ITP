		<content> Denchworth has no school. A school bus
 takes 12 children to and from Hanney  
 Primary School.  One has to go by bus 
 to Wantage for secondary schooling and
 also for any adult education. In      
 Grove, there are 3 play groups and 1  
 private nursery school. There         
 are 2 primary schools in Grove,       
 Millbrook Primary being in W. Grove   
 and having 11 classes and 250-300     
 pupils.  The classrooms there are     
 all open plan (with no closed rooms). 
 The children go into Wantage by bus,  
 bike or car, to one of three schools  
 for children 11-16 and to the Sixth   
 Form College 16-19. There is an Adult 
 Education Centre in Grove opposite    
 Millbrook School. Children from 3-11  
 having private education go to our    
 school, St. Andrew's in Wantage or to 
 schools further away in Abingdon.
