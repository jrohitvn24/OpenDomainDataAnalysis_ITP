		<title>04INDUSTRIAL SOUTH SPONDON</title>
		<content> There are three industries in the     
 southern area of {SPONDON}the smallest
 of which consists of {a depot for the 
{collection and distribution of        
{sheepskins}for the manufacture of     
 coats  and mats for sale in           
 Europe.There is also {a printing works
 which supplies the world with soup    
 labels and sweet wrappers using a     
 Â£1million machine controlled by       
 computer.{The chemical plant,}of which
 part is in this block, makes fabrics, 
 paints,plastics and medicines as well 
 as chemicals.This firm has been a     
 major employer in the area but has cut
 back drastically in recent years.An   
 employee expressed the opinion that   
 'the company had put{SPONDON }on the  
 map, but it was a hot and potentially 
 dangerous place to work.The company   
 provides jobs for school leavers and  
 runs a social club and fishing club.' </content>
