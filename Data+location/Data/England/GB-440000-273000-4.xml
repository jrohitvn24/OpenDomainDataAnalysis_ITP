		<title>04EMPLOYMENT &amp; WOLSTON PEOPLE</title>
		<content> Most{employment}is provided by        
 Bluemel's factory, originally an      
 artificial silk mill but now making   
 motor accessories. At one time        
 employing 800-900 people, mainly from 
 surrounding villages, the factory now 
 gives employment to 84 people mainly  
 women. Children wrote about their     
 visit in 1985 saying: "We saw plastic 
 powder made into mudguards which were 
 made into coils and then cut to size  
 and we saw a machine that put names on
 bicycle pump cases." In addition there
 are many farms in the area, though    
 Wolston has changed from a farming    
 community to a commuter district.     
 There is intensive{chicken farming}and
 British Telecom provides employment   
 through the very modern Wolston{      
{telephone exchange}. The two schools, 
 police station, library, garage and{  
{shops}all provide jobs.               </content>
