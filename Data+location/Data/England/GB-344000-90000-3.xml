		<title>03Bridport Market</title>
		<content>      Bridport is one of the largest   
 towns in West Dorset and on market    
 days it is very busy. The market takes
 place every Wednesday and Saturday    
 thoughout the year. The market        
 consists of a number of stalls set up 
 on the wide pavements of the main     
 shopping streets of East Street, West 
 Street and South Street.              
      There is a wide variety  of      
 different stalls  including food,     
 clothing, crafts, antiques and garden 
 stalls. Some of the stall holders     
 are Bridport shop-keepers, but many   
 stall holders come from as far afield 
 as Yeovil, Ilminster and Exeter. Many 
 shoppers come to Bridport especially  
 for the market, not only from West    
 Dorset but also from Devon and        
 Somerset.
