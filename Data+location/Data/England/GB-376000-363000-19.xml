		<content> The last questions we put to the      
 residents were:{Do you feel that there
{are enough amenities in the area?}and 
{If there were more amenities in the   
{area,would it improve or spoil the    
{area?}                                
       About two-thirds of the replies 
 said that they were satisfied with the
 amenities.The rest were dissatisfied  
 with them and offered suggestions as  
 to what might improve matters.One of  
 the main criticisms was, that there   
 wasn't enough for the younger members 
 of the community to get involved in;  
 and due to the lack of a decent bus   
 service,the youth of the village,     
 unless ferried by parents, had nowhere
 to go.If a Village Hall was built this
 could be rectified,as a Youth Club    
 could be set up.
