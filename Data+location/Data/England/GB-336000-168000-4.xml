		<title>04THE STRODE SPORTS CENTRE</title>
		<content>                                       
 The {Strode Sports Centre}was opened  
 in 1984 in the {Wast End of Clevedon. 
 100 people come to the centre on an   
 average day.The sports hall is used   
 the most. 12 people work there and    
 some part-time. Mostly it is adults   
 who use the centre. About 90 to 100   
 people go to the body shop per week to
 do weight lifting.                    
 A{swimming pool}is going to be built  
 which wil include a learner pool and  
 you can have lessons.                 
 We asked some people what they thought
 of the sports centre. One lady said   
 she would not recommend the sports    
 centre to anyone because there was not
 enough equipment,but the rest said    
 they would,that it was a great idea   
 and the swimming pool too.
