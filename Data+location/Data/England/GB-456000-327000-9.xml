 school playground. The most popular   
 game is called{Wall.}You run to the   
 wall and the last person to touch it  
 is on. They have to try and tig{touch 
 anyone who runs across the playground.
 When they're all tug{touched,}someone 
 shouts "wall" again and the game is   
 repeated.{Tiggy Scarecrow}is another  
 game where the person who is on tigs  
 the others. If you get tug you stand  
 as a scarecrow and somebody who isn't 
 on has to go through your legs with   
 out being tug to free you.{Hot Rice}is
 a game with a ball. You have two on   
 and they throw a ball at the others.  
 If it hits them below the knee they   
 are on and the game carries on until  
 everyone is hit with the ball. The    
 girls play two kinds of skipping, one 
 with a long rope and one with a loop  
 of elastic called{French skipping.    </content>
