		<title>14Bickleigh/Wotter recreation</title>
		<content> The village green at Bickleigh is a   
 long triangle of well kept grass with 
 a few large trees.The only playing    
 fields are those within the camp and  
 not on public access.                 
 Wotter has a recreation hall under the
 Methodist Church.The children's       
 playground is a piece of moorland with
 rough grazing continuing around the   
 swings,slide and seat.It is invaded by
 bracken and gorse and has a hut circle
 amongst the boulders.Residents        
 complain of inadequate parking        
 facilities and compare it unfavourably
 with the old playground which was cut 
 off from the village  when the by-pass
 road was built.One farm which borders 
 on the open moor has been converted   
 into a high class livery stable and   
 Camping Club site.The National Park   
 Authority will not permit development 
 of a caravan camp.                    </content>
