		<title>19A Church in Kirk Sandall.</title>
		<content> The{Emmanuel Congregational Church}   
 started to be built in{May 1929.}     
 There is a foundation stone laid by   
{Richard Austin Pilkington}on{May 8th. 
 The official opening was not until    
 November of that year.                
 The church has two cloakrooms, a      
 vestry and kitchen and two upstairs   
 rooms as well as the main hall and    
 stage. There are two organs, one in   
 the hall and one in the vestry; also a
 piano.                                
 The Church is surrounded by large     
 grounds which have been neglected over
 the years. Children can play in the   
 grounds as well as the park next to   
 it. Funds are raised by jumble sales  
 and bazaars. In the church there is   
 also a sunday school. The size of the 
 congregation has altered over the     
 years - it is now going down.
