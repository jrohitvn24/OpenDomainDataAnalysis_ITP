		<content>   The Council is to carry out         
 improvements to the toilets at the    
 Village Hall costing Â£1,100.The       
 erection of playground equipment and  
 the painting of existing equipment    
 will cost Â£850. The drive to Redwood  
 Drive Community Centre is to be kerbed
 and re-surfaced costing Â£4,000 and the
 Sidney Hall Playing Field is to be    
 drained at a cost of Â£2,500. A higher 
 standard of maintenance of the burial 
 ground is being under-taken this year.
 200 trees are to be planted in        
 Somerton Gate Lane.                   
   The withdrawal of subsidised school 
 bus services is one problem the       
 Council is fighting the County        
 Education Committee. The route over   
 which children walk when not using the
 bus is dangerous both from traffic and
 the danger of attack. The local MP is 
 backing the Council's case.           </content>
