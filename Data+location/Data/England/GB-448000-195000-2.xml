		<content>Abingdon Abbey was founded in 960 and  
twice destroyed. In 977 King Edward    
and Archbishop Dunstan ordered Bishop  
Sideman to be carried to St. Marys     
Abbey in Abingdon.  Abbot Faritius     
finished building in 1170, the Abbey   
church was 370 ft long.  In the l5th   
century the Abbey was the greatest     
abbey in England, except Glastonbury.  
Most of the Kings and Queens of England
were guests at the Abbey, Edward the   
Confessor, King John, Henry 111, Henry 
V111 and William the Conqueror who     
spent Easter there in 1084. King John  
came to rest at the Abbey.  The old    
gateway of the Abbey was built in the  
late l5th century.  The townsfolk had  
no  love for the Abbey because it told 
them how to live their lives.  The last
royal guest was Henry V111 who spent 3 
months there to avoid the plague in    
London.                                </content>
