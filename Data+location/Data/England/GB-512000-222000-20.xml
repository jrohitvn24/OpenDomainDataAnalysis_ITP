		<content> out,an extra three miles to a car     
 owner is not much of a problem, but   
 the closure is during the worst winter
 months and it is not unknown for the  
 village to be cut off from surrounding
 areas for days at a time due to snow  
 blocking the narrow access lanes.     
 The landlord of the village pub has   
 already suffered loss of earnings due 
 to the last road closure, and now     
 faces a bleak future with the next.   
 Because there are no shops in         
 Cockernhoe, the building of a huge    
 Fine Fare supermarket within the new  
 housing complex, only 15 minutes walk 
 away, must have been a boon for local 
 housewives.Stocking a range of goods  
 from furniture and home decorating to 
 freshly-baked bread and cakes, it     
 enables local people to do all their  
 shopping under one roof.
