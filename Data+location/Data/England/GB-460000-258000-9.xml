		<title>09 WEEDON NEWSPAPER SHOP</title>
		<content>  We all went to the newspaper shop and
asked the owner some questions.        
  She told us that her family had owned
the paper shop for about 40 years.About
three years ago they built a new and   
bigger shop.                           
  About fourteen boys and girls deliver
the newspapers in the morning and the  
evening.On Sundays they deliver papers 
to many other villages as well as to   
Weedon.                                
  Their working day starts at about    
04.00 hours and ends at 19.00 hours.   
  Her shop has never been burgled.At   
their shop they sell most copies of The
Sun,The Daily Mirror and The Daily     
Express.
