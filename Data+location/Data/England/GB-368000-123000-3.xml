		<title>03THE STAPLETON ARMS</title>
		<content>  The public house in Buckhorn Weston  
 is called the Stapleton Arms after the
 Stapleton family who owned the village
 some 300 years ago. They obtained it  
 from the Stourtons(owners of          
 Stourhead)in some form of marriage    
 agreement.All the surrounding villages
 were retained by the Stourtons and    
 later the Hoares.                     
   Sir Arthur Stapleton is the last    
 remaining member of the Stapleton     
 family and the estate has all been    
 distributed.The pub is now a          
 freehouse.                            
   It is regularly used by local       
 people, about two dozen at any time   
 during the evening. It has a dartboard
 and provides snacks.Beer is charged at
 approx.ninety pence a pint and spirits
 at around sixty to seventy pence for a
 single measure.
