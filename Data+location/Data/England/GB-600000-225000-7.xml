		<title>07Community Police Officer.</title>
		<content>{P.C.Barton}is our Community Police    
 Officer. That means that he patrols   
 the area of Parsons Heath either on   
 foot or on his bicycle. His main job  
 is to get to know people and to       
 investigate crimes within the area.   
 For this he visits old peoples' flats 
 and three primary schools, Roach Vale,
 St. Annes and Parsons Heath. He is    
 also stopped by people whilst he is   
 patrolling the area.In schools he     
 talks to the chldren about his job,   
 road safety and warns us not to go    
 with strangers. He has his own office 
 along Ipswich Road and enjoys doing   
 his community work. This kind of work 
 does interfere with his other police  
 work and the hardest part of his job  
 is to be patient with people who keep 
 telephoning him with problems he      
 cannot solve, almost wasting his time.
