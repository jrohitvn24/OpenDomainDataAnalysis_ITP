		<content> Adderley is a small village with about
 sixty houses and bungalows.There is a 
 village school,nearly all the children
 from Adderley go to it.There is also a
 Bowling Green,Village Hall,Garage,Post
 Office,and an Antique shop.There is a 
 Village Green we play on by the       
 Village Hall,we climb the trees there.
 There are some old swings near the old
 Railway the top of Green Bank.There   
 are three old peoples homes over      
 looking the swings.Most of the people 
 are friendly in Adderley,but some     
 people keep themselves to themselves. 
 Tom Butter owns the Post Office.He is 
 building a house opposite the shop.   
 There is also an Estate in Adderley   
 but it is not very big.Adderley is a  
 nice little village and we would not  
 like anybody to change it.We are      
 really a little commuter/farming      
 place.                                </content>
