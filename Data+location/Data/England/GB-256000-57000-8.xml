		<content>   One day I was asked if I would like 
 to go to France so I said "Yes".      
   I got up at six o' clock in the     
 morning because the boat left at ten  
 o'clock. It took four hours to cross  
 by boat.                              
   When I got there someone from       
 the French family was waiting for me  
 so I got of the boat and went to see  
 them. I found out that they were      
 nice. They brought me some games to   
 play and some sweets to eat.          
   So we got in the car and started    
 heading back to where they lived. I   
 fell asleep some of the way.          
   So when I woke up we were there. I  
 found out it was a farm.              
   By the time I got there it was bed  
 time.
