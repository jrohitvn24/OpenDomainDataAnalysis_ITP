		<content>    Our study area is situated in {    
{North Lincolnshire,}north-east of the 
 small market town of Caistor.The block
 extends from the west facing scarp of 
 the chalk Wolds continuing east along 
 the dip-slope which contains several  
 dry valleys. This is a rural area;    
 only five isolated settlements appear 
 in the block. Forty-four per-cent of  
 the working population are involved in
 jobs related to agriculture. Fifteen  
 per-cent of the block is covered with 
 forests, a part of the Earl of        
 Yarborough's estate. The remaining    
 part of the study area is under the   
 plough but most farmers practise mixed
 farming eg. sheep on steeper slopes.
