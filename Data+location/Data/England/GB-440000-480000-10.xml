		<title>10The Remarkable Mr. Foggit</title>
		<content> Mr. Foggit, aged 72, keeps weather    
 records as did his father and         
 grandfather. He relies on nature, a   
 barometer, and his records to forecast
 the weather. For years he has written 
 a weather column in the newspaper. He 
 is interviewed on TV. He also records 
 a message for British Telecom's 'Dial 
 the Weather'. He observes animal and  
 plant behaviour, knowing that in fine 
 weather swallows fly high for insect  
 food, spiders spin long threads,      
 certain flowers open and cows are     
 spaced about the field.               
                                       
{Mr. Foggit   by Zoe Marshman}         
 He forecasts weather in his old age   
 Not by satellite or a gauge           
 He uses nature for his source         
 Flowers like chickweed,hawkweed,gorse,
 You see all close when things look wet
 Mr. Foggit's our local Met.           </content>
