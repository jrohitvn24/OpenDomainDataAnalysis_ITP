		<content> We moved house to Urchfont for we     
 needed a bigger house.I used to live  
 in Devizes,Wiltshire.The postmen      
 used to complain when people put Wilts
 on are letters in stead of Wiltshire. 
 I used to go to Southbroom infant     
 school.My teacher was Mrs Taylor.Who I
 quite liked.When I was a first year I 
 worked slowly because nobody new I    
 needed glases.We moved to Urchfont in 
 1980 on the 10th of January.My dad    
 still kept the same job.My dad is a   
 surveyor.He does the written work at  
 home ,but measures mostly at army     
 bases.There are quite a few bases he  
 goes to.Like Corshum,Yeovilton and    
 Wroughton.He sometimes has to measure 
 in underground bomb bunkers.He has    
 secret plans of military bases and    
 when he has learnt the way round the  
 base he has to  burn the plan.
