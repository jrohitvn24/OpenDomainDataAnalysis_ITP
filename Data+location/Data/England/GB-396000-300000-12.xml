		<content> There are 3 community schools in our  
 area,Pool Hayes,Furzebank and Sneyd. I
 do canoeing and life saving at Pool   
 Hayes.Canoeing is on Thursdays from   
 7.00 to 8.00 but the more experienced 
 can stop until 9.00.Life saving is on 
 Tuesdays from 6.00 to 7.00.I can now  
 swim 1000 metres and have passed my   
 bronze survival award and am now      
 trying for my silver.My mum goes to   
 keep fit in the gym on Wednesdays and 
 my sister does Karate on  Fridays.    
     Other activities which are        
 available include badminton,squash,   
 five a side football,judo,indoor      
 bowling,aerobics and modern dance.My  
 dad is the only one in the family who 
 does not use Pool Hayes,he spends his 
 spare time gardening and fishing.
