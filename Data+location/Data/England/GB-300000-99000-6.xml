		<content> The vicar at the time thought it was  
 difficult to fit all the family in    
 around the font because the pews were 
 in the way.The church is built of     
 stone from Kilerton quaries.The organ 
 in the church was from Blundells      
 school.There used to be six bells in  
 the church but now there is only five.
                                       
 One of the oldest inhabitants of Clyst
 Hydon is Miss Baker Clark.She lives in
 the old school house with Mrs Isaac.  
 Miss Baker Clark knows a lot about the
 church and she used to be one of the  
 bellringers.Her nephew who is ten,    
 rings the bells at Clyst Hydon and at 
 a church in Tiverton.He had a special 
 bit in the paper about him plus a     
 photo of him ringing the bells.Miss   
 Baker Clark has the key to the church 
 and often goes in there.The school    
 house used to be the old school.      </content>
