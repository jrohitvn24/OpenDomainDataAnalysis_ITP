 At the centre of religious life in    
 Bedlington is St Cuthbert's Church.   
 Its origins are to be found in the    
 Anglo-Saxon times but much of the     
 church has distinctive Norman         
 features.  The present incumbent (Rev 
 Keith Ward) has seen many changes over
 his 20 years as vicar - women         
 ministers, modern music and shorter   
 services. Funding is a major problem. 
 Pounds rather than pence are needed in
 the collection tray especially as the 
 church contributes to diocesan funds. 
 People have to be coaxed into the     
 church. The grave yard allows a       
 glimpse of Bedlington's past. A stone 
 (Watson's Wake) is to be found on the 
 tower and is dedicated to Cuthbert    
 Watson a local personality who died   
                                       
 while sleeping on the tower in l669.  </content>
