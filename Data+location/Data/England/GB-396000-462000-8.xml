{livestock}and is mainly{dairy}or{sheep
{farming.}All the farmers use good     
 pedigree{Friesian cows.}Because of the
{quota system}many farmers in the area 
 have had to cut the size of their     
{herds}to accord with their{quota.}The 
{European Economic Community}have      
 discovered that there is an excess of 
{milk}being produced and so every{dairy
{farmer}is assigned a{quota.}Any{milk  
 produced above the{quota}is either    
 destroyed or the farmer has to pay to 
 have it taken away.{Sheep farming}is  
 also extensive, the most popular      
 breeds being{Swaledale,Dales Bred}and 
{Masham.}This is a cross between       
{Swaledale}and{Teeswater}or            
{Wenslydale.}Animals are bought and    
 sold at{Auction}in{Skipton,Hellifield 
 or{Glusburn.
