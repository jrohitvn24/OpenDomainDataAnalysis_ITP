		<title>03Lower Park Farm - Lathom</title>
		<content>Today the main crops they grow are     
cabbages,potatoes,leeks,lettuce, and   
barley. They send their crops to       
merchants who send them to packhouses  
and then to supermarkets. All the      
supermarkets want small cabbages so    
that people buy 2 small cabbages       
instead of 1 big cabbage. So,they have 
to grow all their cabbages the same    
size.                                  
{Future Farming}                       
We asked the farmer's son what farming 
would be like in the future. He would  
still grow the same crops because he   
knows the crops grow well in Lathom    
soil and there is always a good market 
for vegetables. Hovercrafts are going  
to be used in the future on the farm   
and are already used in the U.S.A. He  
thought Robots will also be used more  
in the future. They are already used   
for planting cabbages.                 </content>
