 I walked past some streets named after
the old squires of Finedon such as     
Mulso Road,Mackworth Green,Dolben      
Square.I went past the Bell Inn which  
is believed to be the oldest licensed  
pub in England.A license was granted in
1042.It was largely rebuilt of         
ironstone in 1872 and features the     
arms of the Mackworth and Dolben       
families.There is also a statue of     
Queen Edith who once owned Finedon.Just
beyond the inn is Thingdon cottage,    
Thingdon comes from Tingdene which was 
the original name of Finedon.          
 We passed the former girls charity    
school and the parish church.To the    
north of the church is the old Boys    
School founded in 1595 and bearing the 
coat of arms of Elizabeth I.It is now a
private house.
