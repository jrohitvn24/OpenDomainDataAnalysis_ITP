 married she was in service.When she   
 got married she lived in Braintree and
 moved to Easthorpe in 1932.Then for a 
 few years she worked on the fields.   
 Then she went on to do dinner parties 
 for people doing the cooking and      
 preparations.Then the war came along  
 and her husband wasn't able to work   
 because of injuries.Then she worked at
 Crittalls.After the war she was out of
 a job for a fortnight until she got a 
 job at Marconi's in Chelmsford and she
 was there for twenty-four years until 
 she retired.To Chelmsford from        
 Easthorpe was fifteen miles.She used  
 to cycle to Kelvedon and catch the bus
 from there.
