		<content> Although there is only one church     
 included in the given block,The Bethel
 United Reform Church (036300482),there
 are seven just outside.               
 1 St Oswald's Church (C.E.)  03590484 
 2 St Bernard's Church (R.C.) 03530484 
 3 St John's Church (C.E.)    04030486 
 4 St William's Church (R.C.) 04140478 
 5 Methodist Church,Pilling   04010482 
 6 Elim Pentecostal Church    03530486 
 7 Methodist Church,Knott-End 03530485 
  There seems to be a greater          
 proportion of the population in our   
 block attending church regularly than 
 in the country as a whole,perhaps this
 is because of the high proportion of  
 retired people in our block.The       
 farmers seem to belong to the Church  
 of England.The churches are great     
 centres for clubs and societies and   
 their halls provides many of the      
 locations for meetings of other groups</content>
