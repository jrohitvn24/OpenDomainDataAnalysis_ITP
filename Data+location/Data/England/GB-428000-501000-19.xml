		<title>19Cowtons' Local History</title>
		<content> Our local claim to fame is the Battle 
 of Cowton Moor, when the Scots were   
 defeated by the English in 1138. Scots
 Graves is a field named after this    
 battle. St Marys Church at South      
 Cowton and Cowton Castle were built by
 Sir Richard Conyers between 1450-1460.
 All Saints Church at East Cowton was  
 built in 1910 to replace the old St   
 Marys, which was finally demolished   
 in the late 1960's. The land is now   
 used as a cemetary.                   
 Pepper Arden Hall was the home of Sir 
 Cuthbert Pepper, who died in 1608. His
 decendant married an Arden, hence the 
 name. The Knights Templars built      
 Temple House near East Cowton in 1142.
 A large boulder at Town End Farm in   
 N Cowton is a relic of the Ice Age.   
 Both village schools were built over  
 100 years ago. N Cowton's is still    
 used, the other is being converted.   </content>
