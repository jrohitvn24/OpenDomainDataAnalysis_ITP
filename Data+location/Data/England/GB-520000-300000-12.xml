		<content> There are 3 main housing estates in   
 our area, the oldest of which is      
{Dogsthorpe.}There houses were built   
 about 35 years ago. They are mainly   
 semi-detached, brick buildings with   
 tiled roofs and large gardens, and    
 originally it was a council estate    
 although some residents have purchased
 their own houses. Burford is a smaller
 estate of detached houses. Garages    
 are attached and gardens are neat and 
 spacious. They were built just over   
 ten years ago. Welland is a           
 Development Corporation Estate with a 
 mixture of terraced, semi- detached   
 houses or flats. They are small and   
 compact with little gardens  but wide 
 open play spaces, and car-free paths. 
 The houses have central heating and   
 residents were satisfied on the whole 
 with shops, bus-services ,schools and 
 play facilities.                      </content>
