		<title>10A Gretton farmer's life</title>
		<content>Geoffrey Paul Hunt lives at 6,Corby Rd.
Gretton,with his wife and two sons     
Graham and Richard. He rents 600 acres 
of land altogether and keeps animals   
such as cows and sheep. He starts his  
work at 7.30 a.m. and gets the cows in.
In Spring he goes lambing and is out   
all day up to midnight.He has a combine
harvester,5 tractors-2 four-wheel drive
and 3 two-wheel drive,muckspreaders and
a potato harvester. His is a mixed farm
and he was taught by his father who    
used to run the farm. At harvest time  
he starts work at 7.00 but if there is 
dew on the ground he cannot start until
9.00. Mr Hunt takes the animals to     
Kettering market to sell.He has about  
50 fields,the largest 30 acres and the 
smallest 2.Mr Hunt is worried that most
of the grain he grows will be stored   
away due to national over-production,  
while people in the 3rd world starve.  </content>
