		<title>20 A Walk Into D-Block</title>
		<content>On Tuesday, 2nd June 1985, we-the      
pupils of 1C, Barlby High School,      
enjoyed a walk into "deepest" D-Block. 
The weather was sunny as we entered the
area at around 10.15a.m. Some pupils   
took a right turn to look at a ruined  
farm building. We eventually reached   
crossroads. Some went to investigate   
Beaumont's Scrapyard. Two girls carried
on down the main road to look at a dis-
tant petrol station. The rest of us    
turned right along a tree-bordered     
path. We eventually met up with the    
farm explorers and returned to school.
