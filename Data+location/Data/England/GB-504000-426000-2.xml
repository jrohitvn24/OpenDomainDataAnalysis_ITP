		<title>02LAW AND ORDER IN WEST HULL</title>
		<content>   WE OBTAINED THIS INFORMATION FROM AN
 INTERVIEW WITH A POLICE OFFICER, AND  
 FROM THE 1984 POLICE REPORT.          
   THE DIVISION HAS 22% OF HULL'S CRIME
 BUT ONLY 20% OF IT'S POLICE. VIOLENCE 
 AND SEXUAL OFFENCES ARE AVERAGE, BUT  
 BURGLARY(27%)IS ABOVE,AND THEFT(20%) &amp;
 DRUGS(7%) ARE BELOW AVERAGE FOR HULL. 
   PAPERWORK TAKES UP MOST POLICE TIME.
 SHOPLIFTING HAS THE HIGHEST DETECTION 
 RATE AND THEFT THE LOWEST.            
   TWO PROFESIONAL GROUNDS OF RUGBY AND
 FOOTBALL HAVE SIMILAR SIZE CROWDS,BUT 
 MORE POLICE ARE NEEDED AT FOOTBALL.   
   APART FROM THE HORSE SECTION,DIVING,
 AND FIRE ARMS POLICE WOMEN DO THE SAME
 WORK.                                 
   WEST HULL POLICE STATION IN PRIORY  
 ROAD,BUILT AS A PREFABRICATED UNIT IN 
 1974 IS LIKELY TO REMAIN BUT HAS THE  
 SAME FACILITIES AS MORE IMPRESSIVE    
 STATIONS IN OTHER PARTS OF HULL.      </content>
