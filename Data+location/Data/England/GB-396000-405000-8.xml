		<content> This causes much noise, vibration and 
 danger to the local residents. There  
 have been appeals in the past for a   
 small by-pass to be built  to take the
 traffic away from the hamlet , but    
 this appears to be a faint hope and   
 the problem will probably continue for
 many years to come.                   
   Some of the{local place names}reveal
 links with the 17th century. 'Doctor  
 House' and 'Doctor Lane' relate to a  
 Doctor of Divinity who was a          
 Parliamentary supporter in the English
 Civil War. He moved out of the        
 potentiously dangerous regions to     
 Delph, bought large areas of land and 
 built farms on it. Fields such as     
 'Jericho' and 'Shiloh' were named by  
 him. 'Valenciennes', another local    
 name, was probably connected with the 
 Huguenots who settled in the area.
