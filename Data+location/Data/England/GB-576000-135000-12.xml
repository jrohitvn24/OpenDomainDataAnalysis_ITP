		<content>Cranbrook windmill,a fine example of   
a smock mill is situated near the      
centre of Cranbrook.It is open to the  
public on a saturday and on bank       
holidays.It is owned by the Cranbrook  
Windmill Association in conjunction    
with the Kent County Council.It is run 
by volunteers.The windmill was built in
1814 by the Millwright Humphrey for    
Henry Dobell.It was known as"Union     
Mill."In 1840 it was modernised by     
George Warren of Hawkhurst.He added a  
Fantail.The windmill is built of brick 
and weatherboard.It has a small balcony
outside the windmill which is about in 
the middle of the windmill.It is a     
very sturdy building,which hasn't been 
wing for many years.Now the Cranbrook  
Windmill Association,which was formed  
in 1982 are restoring the windmill,so  
it will soon be in full working order. 
The windmill is an important landmark. </content>
