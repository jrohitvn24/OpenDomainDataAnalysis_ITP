		<title>15CLIFFTOP WALK.</title>
		<content> The Walk begins at Courtstairs Park   
 near Ramsgate.  The park has lovely   
 trees which are Holme Oak and Silver  
 Birch.  Unfortunately, part of the    
 scenery, the Elm trees, were cut down.
 SMUGGLERS BARN                        
    A reminder of smuggling days are   
 the first built smugglers cottages at 
 Pegwell Village and have become a     
 famous part of Pegwell Bay.           
    Pegwell is also famous for its     
 shrimp paste.The lids from the jars of
 paste have now become a collectors'   
 item one even being found in the      
 sewers in the capital of Australia!   
 PEGWELL VILLAGE PLEASURE GARDENS      
    Unfortunately, all that is left    
 of the village is a car park and a    
 wasteland just by the cliffs. There   
 were at one time just below the cliff 
 Victorian Pleasure Gardens and a pier.
