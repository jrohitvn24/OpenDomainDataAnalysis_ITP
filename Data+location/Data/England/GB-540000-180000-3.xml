		<title>03WEST BECKTON WALK (2)</title>
		<content> We looked on the map and before the   
 houses were built it was just         
 wasteland.                            
     We also went to the new Beckton   
 District Park. It had a trim trail. We
 had a go on all the apparatus but the 
 park was not yet open. We were some of
 the first people to go in th park.    
 There was a boating lake and lots     
 ofthings to do. On the lake there     
 were lots of ducks. It was very good. 
     South of the school is King George
 V park. It has a skateboard rink. The 
 field that belongs to our school is   
 next to the park. There is a club in  
 the park. You can play table tennis,  
 snooker, cards, make puzzles and other
 things. There are also swings slides  
 and climbing frames. In the east of   
 the park there are small hills. Lots  
 of people take their dogs for a walk.
