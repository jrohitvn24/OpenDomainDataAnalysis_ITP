		<content>     Around the beginning of the       
 nineteenth century saw the start of   
 the cotton industry in the Walsden    
 valley, which developed throughout the
 century with the building of the      
 cotton mills. Transport for these was 
 provided first by the canal system,   
 which was the first canal route       
 linking Yorkshire with Lancashire and 
 later by the railway system. During   
 this century the cotton has declined  
 and so the pattern of industry in the 
 valley has changed.                   
    Some of the mill buildings are     
 still in use but have been divided    
 into smaller units, so that various   
 smaller firms use the premises the    
 majority of the existing industries in
 this valley have been developed since 
 the war and cover a wide range of     
 products.          (See next page)
