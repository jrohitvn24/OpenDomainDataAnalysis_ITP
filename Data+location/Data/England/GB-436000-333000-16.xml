		<content>   We went to look at the streets in   
 Alvaston.We saw different kinds of    
 houses.We saw{bungalows.}They have no 
 upstairs.Most bungalows were for old  
 people.                               
                                       
   We saw{semi-detatched}houses,two    
 houses joined together.We saw{detached
 houses.These stand on their own.We saw
{terraced}houses.These are rows of     
 houses joined together.               
                                       
   Most of the houses we saw were semi-
 detached.Many are around{50 years 0ld}
 but there were newer ones.The terraced
 houses we saw were about{100 years    
 old.They are{Victorian}terraces.      
                                       
   There is a mixture of{owner occupied
 and{Local Authority}owned houses in   
 the area.
