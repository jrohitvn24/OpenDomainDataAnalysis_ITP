		<content> Saturday 16th June 1985 Essex Show    
 Day. I got out the car sensing the    
 business and excitement of the day.   
 There were people running here and    
 there with horses,dogs and other      
 animals.As I walked through the car   
 park I could hear men shouting their  
 wares.I could see the horses and foals
 in the judging ring as I got closer I 
 could see that some of them had       
 rosettes on their bridles.            
 There were large white tents          
 with livestock and their owners inside
 everybody busy enjoying themselves.   
 The fairground was packed with people,
 amusements,a big wheel,ice cream vans 
 and hamburger stalls trying to sell   
 their food to passers by.Everybody    
 enjoying themselves.                  
 Due to the recent rain there was mud  
 everywhere, mud on shoes, mud on boots
 ,mud on push chairs, everywhere mud.  </content>
