		<content> Although Melton Mowbray is very old,  
 very few of its buildings are more    
 than 80 or 90 years old. The oldest   
 buildings are in or near the town     
 centre.e.g.the Parish Church, the     
 almshouses, the Anne of Cleves        
 House and the Swan Porch which        
 recently burnt down.                  
                                       
 Along the sides of the main roads     
 leading into Melton Mowbray, large    
 houses were built between 1886-1904.  
 Since the war there has been much     
 redevelopment and new housing estates 
 have filled in the areas between the  
 main roads.                           
                                       
 Unfortunately many old buildings in   
 the town centre have been demolished  
 to make way for newer shops while     
 others have merely changed their use.
