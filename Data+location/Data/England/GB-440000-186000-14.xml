		<title>14Lockinge Estate,Ardington 2.</title>
		<content>  At the time when many large estates  
were being broken up and increasing    
mechanisation meant fewer jobs, the    
present owner,Mr Christopher Loyd,asked
the parish councils of Ardington and   
Lockinge to define the sort of villages
they wanted.                           
 They decided that the villages should 
retain existing amenities and attempt  
to bring in new people who had         
something in common with the existing  
population.                            
 The Estate responded by creating      
workshop premises from redundant farm  
buildings.30 new businesses employing  
100 people are now established.        
Some houses have been sold to employees
and the money spent on modernising the 
rest.The Estate runs a timber yard and 
employs 18 people to make doors and    
window frames etc. and maintain the    
buildings.                             </content>
