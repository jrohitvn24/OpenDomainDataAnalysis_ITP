		<content> The church of St.Giles is 12th century
 with later tower and many alterations.
 On 3 sides there are medieval sites.  
 The south wall of Court House &amp; the   
 Great Tithe Barn,built 1250,are the   
 only remains of the 1205 Cistercian   
 Grange.It was dissolved in 1535 and   
 sold to the Morys family.             
 The fields were enclosed in 1659 &amp; no 
 depopulation apparently resulted.The  
 18th century turnpiking of the A420 &amp; 
 B4019 resulted in the lack of use of  
 three roads,now bridleways and the    
 opening of the Holloway.              
 The school opened 1865 &amp; closed 1965. 
 The Methodist Chapel,built 1875 closed
 about 1950.In 1953 there was a meal   
 there to celebrate Elizabeth II's     
 Coronation.The Parish Reading Room was
 opened in 1900 &amp; is still in use. The 
 public house,the Royal Oak,was closed 
 in about 1962.                        </content>
