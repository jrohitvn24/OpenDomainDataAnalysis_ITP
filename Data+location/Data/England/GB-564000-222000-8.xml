 entertainment.Twelve people organise  
 it.50% of the people dress up.Some    
 costumes are bought in shops.They have
 the Elizabethan Fayre because they    
 want to carry on with Elizabethan     
 life.They raise about Â£5000 every 4   
 years.At the Elizabethan Fayre        
 in between 5000 and 7000 people attend
 in two days.Everybody makes a         
 procession through the street.The     
 procession is led by Queen Elizabeth  
 in her carriage and all her           
 ladies-in-waiting follow.There are
