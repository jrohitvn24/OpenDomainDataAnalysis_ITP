		<title>04Milborne Port Parish Council</title>
		<content> Following the 1894 Local Government   
 Act,a{Parish Council}was established  
 for Milborne Port.This replaced the   
 "vestry",a meeting in theory of all   
 the male inhabitants,but in practice  
 of the more prominent.The"vestry"     
 still meets once a year,to elect      
 church wardens.                       
 The{Town hall,}previously the property
 of the Medlycott family,was purchased 
 by the parish in 1949.                
 Milborne Port had its own fire engine,
 presented by T.Medlycott in 1733 which
 was in use for over 100 years.In 1951 
 it was sent on permanent loan to the  
 County Museum in Taunton.             
 Today the council still meets on the  
 third Tuesday of every month at the   
 Town Hall.The{Parish Council}is       
 elected every four years when 13      
 members are elected to serve.
