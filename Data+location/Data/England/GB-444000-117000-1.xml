		<content> The area is centred around the railway
 junction and works.It is predominantly
 a town of small industry surrounded by
 water meadows and farmland.           
  The airport is a very large area     
 partly within the{D Block}with a      
 strong influence on the inhabitants.  
  The area is expanding quite rapidly  
 and the town centre is undergoing a   
 lot of re_development,at present      
 consisting mainly of demolition to    
 make way for new shopping precincts.  
  Most of the housing development is on
 the outskirts of the town in Boyatt   
 Wood and Bishopstoke.                 
  An old gravel working which was      
 opened to supply the M27 motorway has 
 been landscaped to provide watersports
 faciliies.
