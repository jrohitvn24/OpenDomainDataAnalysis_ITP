		<title>03Interview with our Vicar</title>
		<content>We interviewed Rev. Condry the vicar of
Bloxham.Our first question was what    
happens at the church?We have services 
on Wednesday mornings and Sundays,about
six come on Wednesdays and 50-80 come  
on Sundays.I think the church is a bit 
under used.We have Bellringing and     
choir pratice in the church.People     
think the church is rather gloomy &amp; I  
wear very dark and gloomy clothes.We   
have 8 bells the largest is 200lb.The  
vicarage was built in 1959.The spire is
198 feet high.I come to do assembly on 
Monday mornings which is hectic.We wear
black shirts with a tunnel,the tunnel  
is where you put the white plastic.    
People come to church when they are    
about 11 then stop when they are about 
13 then start coming again when they   
are about 30-40.The Church is a very   
big building,the biggest in the        
village.                               </content>
