		<content> The school children go out of the area
 either on the school bus or with      
 parents, so they rely on their bikes  
 or parents to get to youth groups like
 scouts or guides, and to discos or    
 lake pursuits in Windemere or Kendal. 
 There are no facilities except the    
 local public house the Brown Horse,   
 which is quite large and does a good  
 trade. Most homes have a television   
 and the reception is moderate to good,
 depending on access through hills to  
 the booster. There are events in the  
 village hall. Practically every remote
 home has a dog and hound dogs are also
 housed and walked until mature enough 
 for the local hunts.
