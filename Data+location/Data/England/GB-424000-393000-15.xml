		<content> Because of the altitude, exposed      
 nature of the area, the relatively    
 poor soil and steep slopes, farming   
 tends to be pastoral.Sheep and cattle 
 graze on the sloping fields. Some     
 pasture has been improved by adding   
 fertiliser and by cutting drainage    
 ditches. The only crop is grass.Some  
 is cut by machine in June and stored  
 in a silo for winter fodder. The      
 farmers buy and sell their  livestock 
 in Penistone and Bakewell. Many farm  
 buildings are now occupied by people  
 working in one of the  nearby towns.  
 Such people either sell or rent their 
 land. The farms which are still       
 "working farms" have increased their  
 acreage as much as four times over the
 last 20 years.
