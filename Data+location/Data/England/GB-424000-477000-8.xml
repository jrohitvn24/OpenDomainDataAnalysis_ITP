 SLENINGFORD WATERMILL. THE SITE WAS   
 WHERE AN OLD CORN MILL USED TO BE.THE 
 RIVER URE IS ONE OF THE MAIN          
 ATTRACTIONS FOR THE SITE.PEOPLE WHO   
 COME ARE ABLE TO FLY_FISH,CANOE,      
 SWIM,PADDLE ORJUST ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL
 SURROUNDINGS.THE RIVER CAN BE         
 DANGEROUS AFTER HEAVEY RAIN,IT CAN    
 RISE IN ONLY TWO AND A HALF MINUTES.IF
 PEOPLE COME AND STAY ON THE SITE,THE  
 RIVER SPORTS ARE FREE,BUT THE         
 FISHERMEN HAVE TO PAY Â£4 PER
