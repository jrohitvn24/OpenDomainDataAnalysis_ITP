		<title>14Our Garage at Watch Hill.</title>
		<content> My Dad is a mechanic.A mechanic's job 
 is to fix cars. Sometimes I help my   
 Dad fix a car.I can start a car but I 
 can't drive it.When I grow up I want  
 to be a mechanic.My Dad has to go up  
 our lonning into his garage.As well as
 fixing cars he mends bikes and lawn   
 mowers.It is a good job because you   
 meet people and make new friends.     
 My Dad has one pick-up van and two    
 cars and three scrap cars.He starts   
 work about 9.00 and finishes at       
 16.00,so we hardly see him all the    
 day. These are some of the tools my   
 Dad uses;a welder for joining metal   
 together,spanners for tighting nuts,a 
 drill for making holes,a jack for     
 lifting cars and screw drivers for    
 screwing screws in.My Dad told me it  
 took him five years to train to be a  
 mechanic. He has had his garage for   
 four years.                           </content>
