		<content>   The farm dates from Georgian times, 
 and work on building it was finished  
 on the 29th June 1796.  The current   
 owners still have the original        
 document for the house.               
   For hundreds of years the farm was  
 like any other, happily going about   
 its business.  However, in 1923       
 something rather disastrous occurred, 
 namely an outbreak of Foot and Mouth  
 Disease.  At that time the farm       
 employed some sixty people, and rather
 than have them idle, the owner, a Mr. 
 Kettell, ordered the construction of a
 silo.  The silo is rather unusual     
 since it has a battlement top.        
   The current owners have cleaned up  
 the silo, painted it white, and put a 
 flag on top of it.  They are as yet   
 undecided as to what they will do with
 it.
