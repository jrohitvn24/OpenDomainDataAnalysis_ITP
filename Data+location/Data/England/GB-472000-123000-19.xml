		<title>19NEW BY-PASS FOR PETERSFIELD</title>
		<content> Petersfield is on the main A3 road    
 between London and Portsmouth. The    
 single-carriageway road goes through  
 the Eastern side of the town, and     
 traffic is often congested. A by-pass 
 is needed at Petersfield because      
 through traffic needs a faster road   
 and also we need to get fast traffic  
 out of the town.  The by-pass will go 
 through some peoples' houses and land,
 which is a problem. During 1985 there 
 has been a Public Inquiry which shows 
 that most people want the 'Green      
 Route', which goes to the North and   
 West of Petersfield. It will go       
 through part of Bedales school, parts 
 of Sheet and Steep and will affect    
 half the farms in our block, but it   
 will reduce traffic in a conservation 
 area. Conflicting interests have      
 caused considerable public discussion 
 over recent years.                    </content>
