		<title>17CRANTOCK CHURCHES</title>
		<content>{ST. CARANTOC CHURCH:}In 420 AD St     
 Carantoc came to Crantock from Ireland
 and the church is named after him. A  
 small Saxon Church was built and a    
 nave was added in the 12th century. By
 the late 19th century the Church was  
 in very bad condition and needed      
 restoring. This was completed in 1906.
 At the end of May 1985 a fire damaged 
 the organ and the roof of the Chancel.
 It was started by an electrical fault 
 in a junction box and smoke caused a  
 lot of damage. It took  11 months for 
 work to be completed.  The vicar also 
 looks after the Parish of St. Newlyn  
 East, though many people are unhappy  
 about this sharing. The other place of
 worship is the{Methodist Chapel}which}
 has a larger congregation. The people 
 of Pentire have several 'churches' to 
 choose from in Newquay; e.g. Anglican,
 Roman Catholic, Elim and Methodist.   </content>
