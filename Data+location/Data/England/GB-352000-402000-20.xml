		<title>20HIGHFIELD C.C.</title>
		<content> Highfield cricket field was donated to
 St.Mathew's Church in 1874 by the     
 Blundell family who owned surrounding 
 mines.At first the field was used for 
 tennis and cricket.Tennis was played  
 at the far end of the field.Now only  
 cricket is played.Over the years there
 have been changes.The existing        
 pavilion,which was built by members of
 the cricket club,has recently been    
 modernized.Highfield C.C. has 5 teams:
 the First XI;the Second XI;the        
 Wednesday Team and two junior teams   
 (one under 15's;one under 13's.)      
 Recently an extension and bar have    
 been built.
