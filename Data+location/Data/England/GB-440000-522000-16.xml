		<title>16GAMES CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content> I like playing indoors with my drawing
 things and with my brother and sister.
 I like races,skipping and relays where
 you have to run up to the top of the  
 pavement and run down and tig the next
 person.I like to play{hide and seek   
 where someone has to count and the    
 others hide.You count up to 100 and   
 when you find them they are on to     
 count. When it is raining and I have  
 to stay in I like to play with my toys
 and on my{computer,}listen to records 
 or play with dolls or action men. I   
 like all these kinds of{entertainment 
{and also}to play with my cats. I also 
 play table tennis and snooker in the  
 house when it is raining.Some games we
 play according to the seasons         
 e.g. cricket in summer, "Conkers" in  
 autumn, football in winter and        
 snowballing if it snows and marbles in
 spring.                               </content>
