		<title>08A DAY IN THE LIFE OF RANGZEB</title>
		<content>     I woke up at 7.30 and I had corn- 
 flakes for breakfast.  I went to      
 school by bus.  Our first lesson was  
 set{English.} Then we had play time   
 followed by{Physical Education. } For 
 lunch I had{Halal meat,}mashed        
 potatoes and cake.  After lunch we had
{Environmental Studies}all afternoon.  
 We had an indoor play time because of 
 the rain.  I walked home.             
                                       
     After my tea I went to the mosque 
 to read the{Quran.} The{Quran}is the  
{Holy Book of Muslims.} When I came    
 back I had my chappaties.  I went out 
 to play marbles.  Marbles are solid,  
 small round balls made out of glass.  
 I went in and read a book about       
 prehistoric animals.  I went to sleep 
 at 9.30.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
