		<title>20Children's Leisure Pursuits.</title>
		<content> A survey of the 10/11 year old        
 children in Class 3 at the school     
 showed that they enjoyed the following
 activities at home:                   
{Riding bicycles-}some have motorbikes 
 which they ride in fields.            
{Ponies.}Several children had ponies   
 and spent a lot of their freetime with
 them.                                 
{Computers and Electronic Games }are   
 now very popular.It seemed that some  
 get put away and not used very much.  
{T.V. and Pop Music }are popular with  
 all the children. Perhaps too much so!
{Playtime. }At school the children play
 made-up games such as {gang and chain 
{tick}and {Last up the top,}which is a 
 varation on British Bulldog.          
{CREDITS. }All the work in this section
 was produced by the Headteacher and   
 the children of Class 3 at            
 Leintwardine Primary School,July 1985.</content>
