		<content> Mrs Hancock answered an advertisement 
 in 1980 when Major Dent of Hillfields 
 wanted someone to restore a Victorian 
 garden.                               
 There was an old greenhouse containing
 a vine in the centre of the plot.     
 That autumn Mrs. Hancock sold some    
 cooking apples from the trees and it  
 was suggested she open a garden       
 centre.                               
 She filled the greenhouse with plants 
 and bought a "poly-tunnel" and filled 
 that.  The next year she bought       
 another tunnel.                       
 She sells plants which like acid soil.
  She sells herbs, conifers, shrubs,   
 bedding plants, fruit trees and       
 vegetables.  She will get special     
 plants if you order them.             
 It is a little business but it is     
 growing becuase people here like      
 gardening in their spare time.        </content>
