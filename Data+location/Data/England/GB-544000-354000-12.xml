		<content> Work has started on a new adventure   
 playground near the Village Hall. The 
 project is costing Â£4200. Although 75%
 of the cost is in the form of a grant 
 the rest is being raised by a group of
 local people organised by Mr.T.Shaw.  
 It has taken 2 years planning and hard
 work so far but the project should be 
 finished by the end of 1985.There are 
 also plans for a floodlit hard core   
 court and for the site of the old     
 village pond to be cleaned.Children   
 from school will be helping to plant  
 bulbs and trees around the new pond.  
                                       
 Mrs.I.Lenton and many helpers held a  
 successful sale in the Village Hall on
 9.11.85. Over Â£400 was raised to pay  
 for the children's Christmas Party.
