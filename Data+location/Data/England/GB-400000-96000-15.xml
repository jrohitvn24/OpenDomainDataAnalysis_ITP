		<title>15THE POPULATION,CANFORD MAGNA</title>
		<content> The population of the area has increas
 -ed vastly over the last two decades. 
 The new residents come from all parts 
 of the country,drawn by the employment
 available in such places as Barclays  
 International at Poole,&amp; the many high
 -tech.&amp; light industries which have   
 grown up in Poole,Ferndown &amp; surround-
 ing areas.The pleasant surroundings,  
 mild climate &amp; agreeable atmosphere   
 have also attracted many retired      
 people,so there is now a good mix of  
 all ages.They are drawn predominantly 
 from the middle classes.The l981 cen- 
 sus figures roughly covering this are 
 :-2636 households,3464 males &amp; 3692   
 females.Age groups l752 under l6 years
 42l4 l6-64 yrs,1328 over 65 years.The 
 fact that only 373 households were    
 without cars indicates the comparative
 prosperity of the area.There are few  
 new Commonwealth residents.           </content>
