		<content> The railway station at Chard Junction 
 has been disused since the 1960s when 
 it was closed for economic reasons.   
 Its opening a hundred years earlier   
 had brought trade and industry, and a 
 good many people, to the area.        
                                       
 The station stands on the main railway
 line linking the south-west and       
 London, and trains regularly pass     
 through carrying passengers and       
 freight.                              
                                       
 The newly-modernised Milk Marketing   
 Board factory at Chard Junction is to 
 have railway sidings constructed so   
 that coal for the furnaces can be     
 delivered by rail.                    
                                       
 There are local moves to have the     
 station reopened for passenger trains.
