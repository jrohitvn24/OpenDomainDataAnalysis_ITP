    Mr Lee has two part time assistants
helping him in the shop.The shop does a
delivery service to Wherstead which is 
about three miles away.Trade has       
increased since Mr Lee has had the     
shop .The shop is quite small and      
people help themselves to the goods    
they want off the shelves and then pay 
at the counter.About 100 people use    
the shop regularly a day.People buy    
eggs,butter sugar,bread and day to day 
goods.                                 
    The post office is quite busy for a
small village and about 150 people use 
it on a regular weekly basis.Mr Lee    
lives next door to his shop and also   
runs a small bar adjacent to the shop. 
    Most people go to Ipswich to do    
their big shop once a week or monthly. 
Mobile food vans also visit the village
e.g.a fish and chip van,grocery van etc</content>
