 These two firms are based on a former 
 gravel pit next to the River Nene     
 immediately south of Oundle on the    
 A 605.                                
 In 1964 a small business was begun    
 which employed six people to run the  
 marina as the gravel pit was developed
 and to fit out GRP mouldings as small 
 river cruisers.After 18 months the    
 company began to mould their own      
 hulls.                                
 The two concerns are now separate; the
 Marina provides moorings and          
 facilities for river boats; Fairline  
 Marine builds luxury motor cruisers.  
 The site covers 25 acres.
