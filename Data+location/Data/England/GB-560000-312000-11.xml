		<content> In a very flat land with many         
 waterways, bridges assume a special   
 improtance in the life of local       
 inhabitants.

 I live quite near a bridge. The river 
 is called the New Cut. The sides of   
 the bridge are made of metal and they 
 are very bumpy. The sides are painted 
 green and grey and it looks very nice.
 The bridge is made of bricks and      
 concrete.                             
                                       
 Sometimes a heavy lorry goes over the 
 bridge and bangs into it. There is a  
 path on each side of the bridge, and  
 drains too. A lot of people and bikes 
 go over it. My dad has to go over it  
 every morning to work. My grandad     
 helped build another nearby bridge.
