		<title>11The Village Hall</title>
		<content> West Hill's new village hall is at the
 moment being built.The old village    
 hall was far too small and didn't have
 a car park.The new one was funded by  
 the county council the Town           
 Council and private donations.The hope
 is that the village hall will be the  
 hall for the new primary school if and
 when it is built. The old hall was    
 used for playgroup meetings, school   
 plays, WI and many other things.The   
 new hall will take the place of the   
 old one and will provide for these    
 oganisations much more adequately.The 
 new hall is sited beyond Potters      
 Country Market in the same field as   
 the schools sport area (sqare 11).It  
 will have a large main area,large     
 enough a badminton court and two      
 smaller rooms.
