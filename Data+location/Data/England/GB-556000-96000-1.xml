		<title>01Introduction: W of E'bourne</title>
		<content>    This is predominantly a rural area,
 though with small areas of residential
 housing in the east (East Dean) and   
 the west (Meads). We therefore        
 identified five major topics which    
 needed to be covered in detail.       
    1. The Ecology of the Downs _ the  
 area contains a variety of plant and  
 animal life, both natural and farmed. 
    2. Farming _ much of the area is   
 covered by three farms which          
 specialise in both arable farming and 
 animal husbandry.                     
    3. Tourism _ the economy of        
 Eastbourne depends heavily on holiday 
 makers attracted by the sea, the Downs
 and the healthy climate of the area.  
    4. Housing _ both East Dean and    
 Meads are much sought-after middle    
 class residential areas.              
    5. Education _ there are now       
 several independent schools here.     </content>
