		<content>  From the beginning of time, walkers  
 have passed this way. Prehistoric men 
 trading flints, early men selling     
 salt, the Welsh selling calves, the   
 Turnpike Road, the Sapperton Canal    
 Tunnel of 1784 and the 1845 Rail      
 Tunnel all brought visitors to the    
 area. We noted many walking this way  
 still so we questioned 100 of them as 
 they passed our School playground. It 
 only took us a few days as this is a  
 popular spot. Of the 100, 63 said they
 came because the Village and the      
 Valley were so unspoiled by time. 37  
 came because we have such an          
 interesting history. The Canal and    
 Tunnel lure many. Houses built in the 
 early 20th Century by a group known as
 the 'School of Sapperton Craftsmen'   
 attract hundreds each year.
