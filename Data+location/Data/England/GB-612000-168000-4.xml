		<title>04CLUBS AT HAMPTON, HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> Although this is mainly a residential 
 area there are also some buildings    
 more connected with recreation. A line
 of wooden beach huts face the sea at  
 the bottom of the grassey slope from  
 the road. Just behind these are the   
 buildings used by the Sea Cadets, the 
 Rowing Club and the Hampton Pier      
 Yachting Club. The Sea Cadets takes   
 boys from the age of 11 and gives them
 some training in nautical skills. Some
 of these boys go on to join the Navy  
 when they are older. The Rowing Club  
 is a popular place for a drink and it 
 holds many social functions. The      
 rowing crews are quite strong and     
 compete in regattas around the coast  
 as far as Dorset. The Hampton Pier    
 Yacht Club is not as large as the     
 Sailing Club at the eastern end of the
 Town but it has a modern clubhouse and
 is very busy at week ends in summer.  </content>
