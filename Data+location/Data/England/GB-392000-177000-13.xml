		<content> There are no police stationed in the  
 area, but the villages are covered by 
 a system of Community Policing.       
 Teams of eight policemen based at     
 Chippenham regularly patrol groups of 
 local villages.                       
 The nearest magistrates court is in   
 Chippenham.                           
 In the press the most commonly        
 reported crimes are burgularies from  
 private homes.                        
 The most noteable crime in Sutton     
 Benger was the murder of a 58 year old
 widow, Judith Pearce,in November 1820.
 Her murderer was a gipsy, Edward      
 Buckland, who was the last person to  
 be publicly hanged in Devizes market  
 place in March 1821.                  
 A tombstone in memory of Judith Pearce
 was erected by public subscription and
 can be seen in the churchyard.
