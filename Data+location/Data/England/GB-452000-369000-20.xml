		<title>20LANGWITH DRAMATIC SOCIETY.</title>
		<content> In 1958,Les and Dorothy Salt decided  
 to restart a Dramatic Society in      
 Langwith.They had both been members of
 the St Lukes Players which had to be  
 disbanded during the 1939-45          
 war.Letters were sent to anyone who   
 might be interested in the formation  
 of a Society and at the first meeting 
 41 people attended.The Langwith       
 Dramatic Society was launched.Since   
 it's inception 46 major plays have    
 been performed in the Langwith Church 
 Hall and several of them performed in 
 halls and churches in surrounding     
 villages.One of the most successful   
 efforts was a variety show with many  
 songs and sketches written by         
 members.Sets are designed and         
 constructed by the group and costumes 
 are made by the members.At Christmas  
 members tour the village singing      
 carols collecting for childrens homes.</content>
