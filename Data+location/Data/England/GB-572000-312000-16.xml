		<title>16RELIGION  Pentney &amp; Narboro'</title>
		<content> Pentney and Narborough each have a    
{Parish Church}and share the same      
 Priest. Generally 1 or 2 services are 
 held in each Church every Sunday, plus
 occasional midweek ones. Fair sized   
 congregations attend both. A{Junior   
{Church}flourishes in both parishes.   
{Treasure Trove}in the form of 5 silver
 brooches (98% silver) was found in    
 Pentney Churchyard in 1977. They were 
 valued at Â£135,000. Pentney has a     
{Baptist Chapel}built in 1931. There   
 are two services a month often held by
 lay preachers. Narborough has a       
{Methodist Church}with a service each  
 week. In both cases the Minister in   
 charge is situated in King's Lynn. A  
{Newsletter,}written by the Vicar, is  
 issued every week and contains a Bible
 text and message plus his own letter  
 and news of parish events.
