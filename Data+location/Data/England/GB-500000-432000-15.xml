		<title>15University Student Rooms.</title>
		<content> Inside the Hall we were first shown   
 the Students' Common Room where they  
 could play music, dance and sit around
 talking. We went up a flight of stairs
 and the housekeeper explained that the
 Hall had 75 single bedrooms and 30    
 double bedrooms, each with a          
 washbasin, modern furniture and big   
 windows opening onto a balcony. For   
 every seven bedrooms there were baths,
 showers, toilets and cooking          
 facilities. We went into two bedrooms,
 a single and a double one. They were  
 both very tidy, full of books and     
 clothes. One room even had a radio.   
 There was a telephone in the common   
 room for the students to use. There   
 were six Halls of Residence on The    
 Lawns site. They all look alike. Each 
 Hall is cleaned daily and a           
 housekeeper is there to help the      
 students.                             </content>
