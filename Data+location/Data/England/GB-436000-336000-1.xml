		<content>{Chaddesden}lies to the north east of  
 the{City of Derby,}but within the city
 boundaries.                           
 It is bounded to the south and west by
 the flood plain of the{River Derwent. 
 On the north and eastern sides are    
 found various villages forming the    
 outskirts of Derby, before merging    
 with those villages forming the       
 outskirts of the City of Nottingham.  
 It's mostly an area of{housing estates
 each with its schools, shopping       
 complexes and recreation areas in the 
 form of grassy spaces.                
 There is a new{industrial estate}where
 this block meets the city centre, as  
 well as a{park}which provides         
 recreational facilities for the       
 population on this side of Derby.     
 The land rises sharply to the northern
 edge of this block and a view across  
 the area is one of rooftops and roads.</content>
