 The block has much in the area of     
 historical interest. The village of   
 Aldbury has many, now protected, old  
 and fine buildings. By the pond in the
 centre of the village is the old      
 stocks where misdeeds were punished.  
 Ashridge House was originally a       
 monastry and later the home of the    
 Duke of Bridgewater.                  
 Under the house ot Ashridge is an old 
 deep well which had a donkey driven   
 pump to supply water to the house and 
 the nearby Gaddesden village.
