		<title>05Hop Farming In Horsmonden</title>
		<content>The traditional occupation of the area 
is farming particularly fruit and hops.
A hop garden has a wire framework      
erected over it and in the Spring      
strings have to be set from the frame  
to the ground for the hops to climb.   
Later on the hop shoots are trained up 
the strings.  In September the hops are
ready to pick.  In days gone by        
families of hop-pickers came from the  
East End of London to pick the hops.   
They picked by pulling down the hop    
bines and putting the hops into bins,  
which were made of sacking on a wooden 
frame.  The hops were measured in      
bushels from the bins and put into     
sacks called pokes to be taken to the  
oast house to be dried.  Nowadays the  
hops are picked from the bines by      
machine.
