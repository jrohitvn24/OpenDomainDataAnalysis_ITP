		<content>       I wish{that holiday makers}would
 come to Torquay in the winter because 
 then we would have the beaches all to 
 ourselves in the summer.I'm not saying
 that{holiday makers}are horrible,in   
 fact there is nothing wrong with about
 80% of them.It's just a few who       
 scatter their rubbish all over the    
 place.Most of them know how to use a  
 rubbish bin correctly and they try to 
 keep Torquay tidy.                    
       They park their cars all over   
 the place and nobody who lives in     
 Torquay can park their cars.Torquay is
 full of people when{holiday makers}   
 come.It's awful;nobody can move       
 anywhere and the queues in shops are  
 dreadful.My opinion of{holiday makers 
 is that they are a{NECESSARY NUISANCE}
