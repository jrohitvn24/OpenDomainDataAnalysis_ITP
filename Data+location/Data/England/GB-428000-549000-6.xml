		<title>06LOCAL HISTORY-GREAT LUMLEY.</title>
		<content>{LUMLEY} developed from a tiny,farming 
 hamlet  when the pits  were  sunk. It 
 consisted  of a long  High Street and 
 various colliery-owned terraces,whose 
 names reflected residents' jobs, e.g. 
 Sinkers'Row, Slaters'Row.  The houses 
 lacked  baths and flush toilets.There 
 were shops,a bakery,a doctor's,Duck's 
 Hospital, a National School,an engine 
 house ( a donkey engine  pulled  full 
 trucks  to  the  coal  depot ), three 
 chapels, a church  and thirteen pubs. 
 There were several farms.             
   In the 1920's,  better  housing for 
 pit officials  came to Lumley. Though 
 from  the  1920's - 1960's, the  pits 
 began to close, housing  expanded and 
 three farms disappeared. Today Lumley 
 is not the  mining  community it once 
 was (though the brickworks  still use 
 local opencast shale),but a dormitory 
 village.             {J.Patterson.    </content>
