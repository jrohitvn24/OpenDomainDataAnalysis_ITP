		<content> The full name of the village of Barton
 is Barton-le-Clay, so named because it
 lies on a ridge of Gault Clay. This   
 part of the village is mainly modern  
 estates, mostly built in the 1960s and
 later to typical estate styles.       
  The main road through the village,   
 the A6, suffers from very heavy       
 traffic flows. Barton is the only     
 settlement between Bedford and Luton  
 not to be by-passed. The architecture 
 in Bedford Road is very mixed with    
 much adaptation of older residential  
 buildings to commercial premises. In  
 addition, there has been modern       
 infilling giving a very unbalanced    
 appearance to the view most travellers
 have of the village.
