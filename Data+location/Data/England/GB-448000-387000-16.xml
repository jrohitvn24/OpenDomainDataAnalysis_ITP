		<title>16Comparing Housing</title>
		<content> There are a number of different types 
 of houses in Thurcroft.Many of them   
 are red brick terraced houses built in
 the 1920's.These houses have small    
 front gardens with a back yard.In the 
 yard there are the outside toilets.   
 The houses are of different sizes.Some
 have 2 rooms downstairs and 2         
 upstairs.Others are much bigger.They  
 have now been modernised.             
 A large part of the village consists  
 of a National Coal Board estate built 
 in the late 1930's.These houses are   
 plaster covered and usually painted   
 white.This gives rise to the term     
 'white city'.This is a common name in 
 this area for this type of housing.   
 The third large section of housing is 
 a council estate built in the 1930's. 
 This is made up of 3 bedroom linked or
 semi-detached houses built of red     
 brick.                                </content>
