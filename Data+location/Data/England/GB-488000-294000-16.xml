		<content>   Malcolm and Elisabeth Palmer live   
and work in a large 18th. century      
cottage in Gretton High Street.  They  
have a very well-equipped workshop     
containing all the necessary equipment 
for spinning and weaving.  Elisabeth   
has been weaving for 25 years.  Malcolm
was a mechanical engineer and this     
background knowledge proves useful     
when repairs to spinning wheels and    
looms are required.  Evening and       
morning classes are run in both        
subjects catering for all levels of    
students.  Also about 10 day schools   
are held every year, which include some
tuition in dyeing.  There is always one
outside tutor and one new subject      
covered.  Individual and residential   
courses are also available providing   
both basic techniques for beginners    
and advanced or specialist techniques  
for the more experienced.              </content>
