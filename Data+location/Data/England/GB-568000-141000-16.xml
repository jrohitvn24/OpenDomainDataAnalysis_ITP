 The whole area of Brenchley and       
 Horsmonden is in danger of being      
 changed by thoughtless planning       
 One problem arises where a district is
 on the borders of two planning        
 authorites with differing views       
 Problems are arising where small plots
 of land are being sold off for a      
 variety of non-agricultural uses such 
 as scrap yards and car breakers and   
 stores of non-agricultural products   
 People are very worried about the     
 eventual break up of our farms for    
 this purpose, with land owners living 
 in different parts of the country     
 also it is causing an increase in the 
 use of existing rural services        
 SPORTS                                
 There are two privately owned sports  
 clubs in this area both of which are  
 very well supported                   </content>
