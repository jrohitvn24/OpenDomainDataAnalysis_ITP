		<title>04WAULDBY CURSE.</title>
		<content>  There is a story in connection with  
 the farm. In the Middle Ages there    
 used to be a village but it was wiped 
 out by smallpox. The owners then of   
 the farm wanted somewhere decent to be
 buried if they died of smallpox. So   
 they buiult a Mausoleum. Before they  
 died they had a curse put above the   
 door, so that anyone who broke in     
 would be cursed. When they died they  
 were buried along with their treasure.
 About fifty years ago three boys broke
 into the Mausoleum and started to mess
 about with the bodies and the         
 treasure. A few years later they were 
 all dead. This story might not be     
 true.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
