		<title>09Tavistock Wharf.</title>
		<content>    Work began on the{canal and wharf} 
 in 1803 and was completed in June 1817
 at a cost of Â£130,000. The wharf was  
 built for loading and unloading soft  
 fruit, clay, ore and kersey wool from 
 the barges. These products were stored
 in the Wharf buildings.               
    The wharf buildings now provide    
 accommodation for plumbing and        
 building suppliers, the Guides and    
 Quakers, as well as a collection point
 for old newspapers.                   
   {Restoration plans}have been made   
 for the Wharf. Existing buildings will
 house a museum, working blacksmith,   
 cooper, smithy and lacemaker. Restored
 buildings will be used as a cafe and  
 workshops for a pottery, weaver of    
 kersey wool and soft fruit preservers.
 It is planned that{barges}will travel 
 on the canal.Hopefully it will be     
 completed by 1990.                    </content>
