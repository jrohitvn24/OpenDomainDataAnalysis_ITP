		<title>02BIRDLIP VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  Birdlip is a small village with a    
 population of less than 250 situated  
 on the A417 at the top of Birdlip     
 Hill. There is a primary school, an   
 inn, a restaurant, a church, a garage,
 a Post Office/shop, a village hall and
 a cricket club. In the village there  
 is a saddlers, a builder and an       
 agricultural contractor who also sells
 farm machinery. Some of the people    
 work outside the village in places    
 like Gloucester or even as far away as
 London. Because of the main road which
 splits the village in two, Birdlip is 
 very noisy with the heavy traffic.    
 Permission has been granted for a     
 by-pass to be built starting in 1987. 
 This will make a tremendous difference
 to the village. Permission has also   
 been given for a large extension to   
 the George Hotel which is to include a
 conference centre.                    </content>
