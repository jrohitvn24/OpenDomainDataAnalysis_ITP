		<title>12GROWING FRUIT AT GORGATE</title>
		<content> The fruit farm includes 150 acres of  
 marshland which have been flooded and 
 converted into reservoirs. The water  
 is used for irrigation and protecting 
 the fruit from frost damage. The whole
 farm is covered by a system of water  
 sprinklers. When the system was       
 introduced in 1960 it was the first   
 fruit farm in Western Europe to       
 protect blackcurrants from frost by   
 spraying with water.                  
 Most of the apples grown are Coxs. The
 orchards are surrounded by windbreaks 
 made out of alder trees.This helps    
 produce the slightly warmer conditions
 neede by this variety of apple.
