		<title>02GRAFFHAM PLAYGROUP</title>
		<content> Mrs. Fenneymore began the playgroup 25
 years ago with 10 children in the     
 Empire Hall.  It is held on four      
 mornings and costs Â£1.  There are 29  
 children going altogther but only 20  
 at once.  There are 2 supervisors,    
 Mrs. Dodswell and Mrs. Rogers and 6   
 assistants, mothers also help.  They  
 need 4 adults to ensure safety.  The  
 supervisor arranges the activities,   
 equipment and fund-raising.  They     
 break for refreshments and songs.     
 They have walks and go to Goodwood for
 a teddy bears picnic and the swings.  
 They have lots of equipment and books 
 and believe that the playgroup helps  
 the children prepare for school and   
 also make new friends.  They also     
 visit the school as much as possible.
