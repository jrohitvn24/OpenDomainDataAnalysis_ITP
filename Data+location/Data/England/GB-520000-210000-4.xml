 an expected increase to {50000. }The  
 population rose in the {50s }&amp; {60s } 
 but started to fall in the {70s.}In   
{1920 }there was an amazingly low      
 population of {430 }people,double the 
 number of children in our school      
 today.At the end of {1921  }Welwyn    
 Garden City had a population of {767 }
 which rose in {1925 }to {2584. }By {  
{1927 }it was {5000 }and in {1931 }the 
 population was {8586.}These numerals  
 represent the {1931 }population:-{0-13
 30.8,{14-20 }9.6,{21-44 }42.5,{45-64 }
 14.2,and{65 &amp; over }2.9. Since {1931} 
 the number of children has gone down  
 rapidly. The total population of
