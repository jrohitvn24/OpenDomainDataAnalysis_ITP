		<title>02POPULATION OF NORTHWOLD</title>
		<content> Northwold has a population of         
 approximately 800.                    
 The majority of families have at least
 one member who was born and bred in   
 Northwold.Some older residents still  
 refer to people now living in         
 Northwold but born elsewhere as       
 "outsiders".                          
 There is a relatively high proportion 
 of retired people living in the       
 village.This is partly due to the     
 excellent health care available.It is 
 also due to the fact that limited     
 employment opportunities in the       
 immediate area have led to many young 
 adults leaving the village to settle  
 in the local towns.                   
 Most Northwold families comprise      
 working father,homebased mother and   
 two or three children.
