		<title>18Supernatural: Amy Robsart</title>
		<content> Amy Robsart's strange death (see Local
 History: Characters) gave rise to     
 stories that her ghost haunted Cumnor 
 Place and the surrounding area. There 
 is a tradition that in the 18th       
 century nine parsons came out from    
 Oxford and exorcised her ghost which  
 they laid to rest in the church pond  
 which is said never to have frozen    
 over since. Cumnor Place has long     
 since disappeared but some local      
 residents witin living memory have    
 said that they have seen Amy's ghost  
 wandering in the village, though,     
 unlike her appearances at Cornbury    
 Park near Charlbury, she has not      
 apparently brought bad luck.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
