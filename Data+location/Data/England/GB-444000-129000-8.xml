		<title>08FARMS AND FARMING</title>
		<content> There are 3{farms}in this area,       
 excluding Sarum Farm.This closed down 
 because of the fuel crisis, when the  
 Israel/Arab war started in the        
 1970's. The price of oil shot up,so   
 they couldn't afford to buy it. Crab  
 Wood,Lainston and Barton Farms are all
{arable.} Barton Farm is owned by      
 Winchester College. Each year,the farm
 produces about 600 tons of cereal and 
 grass.The tenant farmer owns one drill
 fertilizer, combine, auger, fork lift,
 3 tractors, 4 cultivators.Twice weekly
 the{cattle market}is held. The breeds 
 include Hereford Cross, Friesian and  
 Jersey. In 1984 they handled 3319     
 cattle,selling for about 95p for a kg.
 Dean Horse Livery is in our area.     
 It was once like Barton Farm, growing 
 crops. Reduced EEC quotas and lower   
 demand for red meat has badly affected
 some farms.                           </content>
