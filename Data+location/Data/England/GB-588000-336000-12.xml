		<title>12THE WARTIME BASE AT EGMERE</title>
		<content> Early in 1943, the{Air Ministry}built 
 an airfield on some land at Egmere for
 U.K. and Norwegian airforces. The run-
 ways were laid by the ladies of the   
{Land Army.}It became a base for{Short 
{Stirling Bombers}and was named North  
 Creake Airfield.{199 squadron}was     
 formed in 1944 to fly missions known  
 as{'window dropping'.}Strips of tin   
 foil were dropped to fool German radar
 into thinking there were whole squad- 
 rons of planes. The one plane lost    
 from this squadron was painted as a   
 mural on one of the shed walls by{Fl. 
{Sgt. Allan}(now deceased) and under it
 were the words CHOP 17-6-44 RIP. It   
 was removed in 1984 and presented to  
{Hendon Bomber Museum.}It was unveiled 
 by Fl.Sgt. Allan's widow on 17-6-84,  
 forty years to the day.{Mosquito}     
 fighter planes came here near the end 
 of the war. Much evidence is extant.  </content>
