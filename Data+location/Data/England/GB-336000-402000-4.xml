		<content> This waterway is one of the dominant  
 features of Maghull and Lydiate and   
 has been since the 18th century.It is 
 no longer as busy as it was when Mrs  
 Currall,ex_mayoress and former pupil  
 of Maghull Church of England Primary  
 School,was a child.She remembers that 
 "On the canal used to be a lot of     
 barges moving up and down,about 12 a  
 day.It was always a good excuse for   
 being late to school,being stuck on   
 the swing bridge as the barges went   
 past."                                
 The canal is crossed by 6 bridges in  
 our D block,including swing bridges   
 which are now need modernisation.     
 This year,1985,Â£212,000 has been spent
 on one bridge by British Waterways and
 the bridge at Shop Lane has been      
 rebuilt.                              
 There is also a plan by Sefton Council
 to spend considerable funds improving </content>
