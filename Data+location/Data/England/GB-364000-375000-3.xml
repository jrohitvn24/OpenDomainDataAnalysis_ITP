		<title>03A DAY IN MY LIFE.</title>
		<content> I live in Comberbach, Cheshire. In the
 morning, in fact it seems the crack of
 dawn, my dad comes into my room and   
 says "Come on, school!". I get up     
 suddenly and put my clothes on. I get 
 a cup of tea and have my breakfast,   
 which I don't like. Next, we sort     
 ourselves out and  leave for school.  
 When we arrive at school, I wait in   
 the car for my friends. When they     
 arrive, we go into the playground. The
 bell rings and we go into school. Then
 we go into Assembly. After that Miss  
 Tierney tells us what we are going to 
 do for the rest of the day.  Most days
 we get Maths up until break at 10.15. 
 Next we do things like English. Art is
 really good, it is my favourite, we do
 it after dinner until 2.15 break.     
 After break we work until home time at
 3.30. When I go home, I play with my  
 Doberman. I go to bed at 10 o'clock.  </content>
