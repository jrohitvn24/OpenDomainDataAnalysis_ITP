		<content> In the D-Block outside Stalham, there 
 are just four telephone boxes, one    
 Post Office, two small shops, two     
 churches, six post boxes and one pub. 
 Our house survey of this area revealed
 that only 37% of the houses had been  
 built in the last 25 years and then   
 not on estates: 23% built 1920-1960:  
 15% were Edwardian or Victorian and   
 25% before that.  The present         
 easily-observable trend of            
 householders is to buy an old house or
 barn and then renovate it.  In this   
 way, many old buildings are being not 
 only preserved but restored privately.
 The biggest implication of this       
 increased mobility of population has  
 been for educational provision in the 
 area.
