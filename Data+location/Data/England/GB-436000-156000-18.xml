		<title>18STYLE &amp; OWNERSHIP OF HOUSES</title>
		<content> Linkenholt houses are estate owned    
 with no new houses. Three are brick   
 and flint with thatch, the rest brick 
 of Victorian style. The Manor House,  
 rebuilt 1912, is let. The Old Rectory 
 is let for 20 years under a repairing 
 lease for nominal rent. The oldest    
 house, Manor Farm, is converted into  
 flats.                                
 One house in Faccombe is privately    
 owned, the remainder owned by the     
 estate, including 10 built 1979. The  
 older houses have been modernised with
 central heating by wood burning       
 stoves.                               
 Of the 39 houses, seven are in        
 Netherton. These are brick &amp; flint,   
 thatched cotages with 1 modern brick  
 bungalow and a fine Georgian Old      
 Rectory.
