		<title>08The Landscape at Stoulton</title>
		<content>   Farming is mainly arable and most   
 of the land is covered with wheat and 
 barley, but also some oats and peas.  
 A modern innovation is the use of oil 
 seed rape which gives rise to large   
 bright splashes of yellow amongst the 
 more gentle shades of the landscape.  
 Orchards containing plums, damsons,   
 apples and pears still exist but they 
 are declining rapidly as are the soft 
 fruits. Cattle and sheep farming are  
 also present. Most of the cattle is   
 young stock nutured for future dairy  
 herds of which there is only one in   
 the area. There are several farms and 
 all are owner occupied, there are no  
 large estates in the area. There is   
 only one large farm of about 1,000    
 acres, the rest of the farms are      
 about 250 acres.
