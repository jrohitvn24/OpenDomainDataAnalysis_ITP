		<content> Parishioners first thought of building
 a hall during the 1939-45 War. After a
 referendum some 40 years on, the Morw-
 enstow  Community  Centre   Management
 Committee, representing local organis-
 ations and the public started the pro-
 ject in 1982.  Grant aid  was obtained
 to combine with local gift and effort.
 The Government  scheme  for  using the
 many unemployed on  Community Projects
 helped.  The hall,  completed in 1985,
 was designed, as far as funds allowed,
 to suit all local needs, eg. concerts,
 indoor sports and meetings. A doctor's
 surgery was included.                 
 On May 11th 1985 Craig Rich, BBC South
 West  "Weatherman"  declared  it open.
 Children  were dressed as weathermaps,
 storms,  frost,  rainbows,  etc.   The
 community then sat  down to tea and in
 the  evening  there  was a celebration
 dance.                                </content>
