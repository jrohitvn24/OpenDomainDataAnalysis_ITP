		<title>08Supernatural in Middleton</title>
		<content> Middleton has at least four ghosts, it
 seems. The Cavalier Squire John       
 Fulwood was mortally wounded by       
 Roundheads at the rock in Bradford    
 Dale near the wooden steps. His ghost 
 is seen walking in the Dale.          
 The Garden House stands between the   
 Church and Middleton Hall. A farmer   
 saw a lady shaking a duster from an   
 upstairs window at 6 o'clock one      
 morning. He commented on this only to 
 learn that the house was locked and   
 empty. There is no explanation. Mr    
 Marsden used to live in part of this  
 house and often heard footsteps on the
 stairs when no one was there. Several 
 people have seen a ghost cross the    
 road and go through the arched gateway
 at Roughwood Hollow. Driving by Arbor 
 Low in the fog one night three strong 
 white silhouettes were twice seen by  
 Mr Rowland and his girlfriend.        </content>
