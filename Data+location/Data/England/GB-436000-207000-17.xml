		<title>17St. Mary's Church, Cogges.</title>
		<content> St. Mary's was built in 1150 next to  
the Priory which had been established  
by Bishop Odo after the Norman Conquest
Part of the Priory still survives as a 
part of the rectory. Originally the    
church had wall paintings inside. It is
quite a small church and can just about
accommodate a hundred people. It has a 
rare chalice made in Elizabethan times.
 The congregation is about 100 each    
Sunday but can be 150 at Christmas or  
Easter or at Harvest Festival.         
 The Vicar is also in charge of the    
small Parish and church at South Leigh.
 At the moment there are about 25      
weddings and 20 funerals each year at  
this church. About 60 children go to   
Sunday School. William Blake is buried 
here and our Primary school is named   
after him. The school was originally   
set up in the Tithe Barn next to the   
church.                                </content>
