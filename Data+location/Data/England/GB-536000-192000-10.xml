		<title>10ARTS AND CRAFTS IN CHINGFORD</title>
		<content>{ Friday Hill House},a very old        
 building, is now used as an adult     
 education centre.Adults learn things  
 like,porcelain painting,pottery,      
 tapestry,weaving upholstery,cooking,  
 painting(oil and water colour) and    
 embroidery.This is a good place to    
 learn arts and crafts because of it's 
 historic surroundings.                
  When we went there a man told us     
 about the building and showed us a    
 fireplace built in 1668.We went down  
 into the cellars,it was very dark and 
 smelly.Upstairs some men were doing   
 some paint work,they had found  an    
 old mural and they were renovating it.
  We discovered when the building was  
 finished when we saw on the porch out-
 side the date,1839.                   
  Afew times a year the local painting 
 society have an exhibition on the     
 green where you can by their work.    </content>
