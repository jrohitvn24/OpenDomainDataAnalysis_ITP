		<title>19A BETTER VILLAGE--T.STAFFORD</title>
		<content> IT'S NICE LIVING HERE BUT IT COULD BE 
 IMPROVED BY HAVING A GYMNASIUM AND    
 TENNIS COURTS BECAUSE I LIKE DOING    
 SPORTY THINGS.ALSO A SWIMMING POOL    
 WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE.                
  MORE SHOPS,AND SWEETS A LOT CHEAPER. 
 A TOY SHOP WOULD BE GOOD BECAUSE THERE
 AREN'T A LOT AROUND HERE AND THERE ARE
 ONLY A FEW IN ILKESTON.               
  NO SCHOOL ON TUESDAY MORNING AND IT  
 STARTS AT 3.00PM AND ENDS AT 3.15PM   
 BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO TO NANAS.       
  A SLIDE AND A ROUNDABOUT ON THE REC. 
  A LIBRARY IN THE VILLAGE WOULD BE    
 O.K. BECAUSE THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE TO  
 GO TO ILKESTON TO CHANGE MY BOOKS.    
  MORE ONE-WEEK HOLIDAYS FROM SCHOOL.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
