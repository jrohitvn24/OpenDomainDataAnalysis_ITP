		<title>18A Wimbledon Umpire</title>
		<content>My friend,Mrs.Guiltz,the Wimbledon     
umpire,began her career in Florida,    
where she lived.She started to play    
tennis with her six children and found 
she enjoyed it.She played on courts run
by her friends husband,who was Chris   
Evert's father.One day he asked her to 
umpire a tournament,which she enjoyed. 
He suggested that she should join an   
umpire's association, so she took eye  
tests and written tests, and joined.   
She has umpired many other tournaments,
such as the French Open, the Junior    
Davis Cup, the National Junior         
tournaments and the Virginia Slims     
tournament.Her favourites include      
Wimbledon and the French Open.Many     
people think hers a glamorous job but  
she says it is not very nice when it is
cold and when you are standing or      
sitting still.
