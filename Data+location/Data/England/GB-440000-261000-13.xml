		<title>13Home Life for Southam People</title>
		<content> Meals tend to reflect the lifestyle of
 the family. Many mothers work so foods
 chosen today are those which can be   
 prepared and cleared away quickly. A  
 typical menu would be:                
  {Breakfast:}Cereal, toast, coffee or 
 fruit juice.                          
  {Lunch:}Sandwiches, salad and cold   
 meat with crisps and a drink.         
  {Tea:}Chicken and chips, yoghurt and 
 a cup of tea.                         
  Families are becoming conscious of   
 healthy eating and cut down on fat and
 salt, eating more salad, vegetables   
 and fruit.                            
  If local people can afford a meal out
 most pubs offer food and so do the two
 hotels in Southam. Foreign tastes can 
 be met by the Kebab House and the     
 Chinese take-away. A great favourite  
 still is of course, good old fish and 
 chips from the local chip shop.       </content>
