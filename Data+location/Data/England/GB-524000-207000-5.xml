		<content>{ St. Marys Church in Essendon}was     
 first built in the 16th century. It is
 built of flint and mortar. It has a   
 tower with a spire and is built in    
 Victorian style. The church is under_ 
 going renovation and the tower is     
 having the most repair. So far Â£30,000
 has been raised. There is also a place
 called Essendon in Australlia. When a 
 font was delivered to Essendon in     
 England, a font that was supposed to  
 go to Essendon in Australlia was also 
 delivered to the village. It was never
 sent to Australlia and now Essendon   
 church England has two fonts.         
  In the first world war the church was
 bombed by a Zeppelin. The eastern end 
 of the church was destroyed and two   
 children were killed. A plaque on the 
 church wall is in memory of them. The 
 cedar tree in the church_yard is over 
 400 years old.                        </content>
