		<title>16My day at Stokenham School.</title>
		<content>  I wake up at about 7.30 a.m. and go  
 to school at 9.10 a.m. When I get to  
 school we write most of the morning   
 until "break". We have three "breaks" 
 altogether. After "break" my teacher  
 talks for half an hour then we go to  
 Maths. Maths ends at 12.15 a.m. We go 
 and line up for dinner. We go in at   
 about 12.30. After dinner we have the 
 longest break of all. When we come in 
 we do reading until 2.00 p.m. then we 
 do our art. We have another "break"   
 at 2.45 and come in at 3.00 p.m.      
 After "break" we have hymn practice   
 until 4.00 p.m. Before hymn practice  
 we have half an hour more of art. Then
 we go home. I go home by car. Me and  
 my brother go out and play until my   
 dad comes home and that is about 7.00 
 p.m. We come in and have tea and watch
 T.V. I go to bed at 9.00 p.m. That is 
 a Monday for my family.               </content>
