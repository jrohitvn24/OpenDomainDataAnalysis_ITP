		<title>06The Whittlebury Skeleton</title>
		<content>On 15th May 1984 the occupants of      
number 13 High Street were mending     
their drive.  After digging down just  
over a metre they discovered a bone.   
Further careful excavation revealed an 
almost entire human skeleton.  The     
police and an archaeologist were       
informed.  It was thought the remains  
were possibly Roman because of the     
proximity of Towcester, an ancient     
Roman camp, but as the skeleton was    
lying W to E the idea was rejected.    
Another possibility was linked to a    
missing tax collector, a man greatly   
disliked locally who disappeared in    
the 1890s. The skeleton was given      
burial by the vicar on 26th May and    
now lies under the yew trees in the    
churchyard of St Mary's, Whittlebury.
