		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE...</title>
		<content>         of{Andrew Chandler.           
 Along with some other{Young Christians
 from{St. Mark's Church,}I went to the{
{Diocesan Youth Day}at{St. Bees School.
 Prior to going we had to choose one or
 more interests for the day. There were
 plenty to choose from; golf, pottery, 
 hairdressing and orienteering to name 
 only a few. I chose to make a video.  
 There were five in each group. We were
 allowed to handle the equipment and   
 familiarise ourselves with the camera.
 After some experimenting and lots of  
 discussion we spent the rest of an    
 exciting day filming the other groups 
 enjoying their tasks.                 
  I have been a{Cub Scout}for three    
 years and have earned many badges. My 
 proudest moment came in June this year
 when I received my{Gold Arrow award}at
 a district gathering. My picture      
 appeared in the{Westmorland Gazette.  </content>
