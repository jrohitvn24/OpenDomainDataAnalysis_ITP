		<content>A lot of people have moved out of      
London to Cheshunt and the housing     
estates are fairly new.There are lots  
of different kinds of houses;bungalows,
terraced houses,detached houses and    
semi-detached ,maisonettes and flats.  
Out of a survey of 26 people most      
people lived in semi-detached houses.  
  On average there are 7 rooms in a    
house, there are bedrooms,a lounge,a   
kitchen and  a bathroom and toilet.    
People decorate their houses with      
different colour wallpaper with        
matching carpets and curtains.Most     
houses have 2 gardens back and front,a 
drive-way and garage.The gardens are   
laid out with lawns,ponds,flowers and  
vegetable beds.In this area there are  
private and council housing estates.   
The council build houses which are then
rented out fairly cheaply to people who
cannot afford to buy their own houses. </content>
