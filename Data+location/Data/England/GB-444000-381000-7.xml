		<title>07INDUSTRIAL AREAS NEAR WALES</title>
		<content> In{Wales}and{Killamarsh}we have three 
 industrial estates serving many       
 different industries. There are many  
 metal engineering firms, storage      
 warehouses and motor repair centres.  
 There is a big food processing firm   
 which makes soup, potted meats and    
 other canned meat products.There is a 
 big firm which produces cereal based  
 foodstuffs for farm animals. Other    
 firms are involved in the construction
 industry, office equipment and        
 computers. Part of the industrial     
 estate in Wales consists of old       
 colliery buildings.Pump manufacturers,
 home insulation firms and tyre        
 manufacturing companies also have     
 sites here.Industrial estates have    
 provided employment for many people   
 but they are quiet, eerie and deserted
 areas with hardly a person to be seen 
 on the streets.                       </content>
