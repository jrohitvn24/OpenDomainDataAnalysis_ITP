		<title>04EVENTS IN FLAMBOROUGH</title>
		<content> In Flamborough we have lots of annual 
 events. In July there is a lifeboat   
 gala held in the Cricket field. We    
 sometimes have shows in the village   
 hall. Some are travelling shows but   
 most of them are our own plays. There 
 is a flower festival in the church. It
 is held every year at the end of July 
 and there are some lovely flower      
 displays. Afterwards you can go in the
 church hall to look at the art        
 displays. Sometimes we have other     
 events and things to aid the lifeboat.
 Every year people dress up as Vikings 
 and pretend to go raiding the village.
 Then we all meet at Cameron's Fardens 
 and some people make speeches. Then   
 afterwards we go to the vicarage and  
 have a gala.
