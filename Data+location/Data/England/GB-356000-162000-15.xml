		<title>15The Fire Station</title>
		<content> Chew Magna fire station was opened in 
 1953 by the Chief Fire Inspector for  
 Somerset.                             
   Currently there are eight firemen,  
 all of whom have other jobs such as a 
 builder,a chef,a gardener,an          
 electrician,a carpenter,an accountant 
 and an undertaker.As part-time firemen
 they are 'retained' and the training  
 for them lasts for three weeks with   
 ongoing training every Monday night.  
 Every fireman carries an alerter 24   
 hours a day.                          
  There is only one fire engine in Chew
 Magna.Before the fire appliance can   
 leave there must be four firemen on   
 board.                                
  Fortunately few false alarms occur   
 and the most common fires near Chew   
 Magna are chimney fires and hedge     
 fires.The biggest cause of fire is    
 children playing with matches.        </content>
