		<title>13The Majorettes</title>
		<content>     I am in the Darfield Royals       
 Majorettes. When I first joined I was 
 on a baton, but in about two months I 
 was on a side drum.  I have gradually 
 worked through the drum section       
 because last summer I was the smallest
 and newest drummer. This year I was   
 moved onto the reserve lead drum so   
 that if ever the lead was absent I    
 could take her place.  Recently I took
 her place in a competetion and I won a
 bronze medal.                         
     Last year we had uniforms, blue   
 dresses trimmed with red and white.We 
 have now got new pleated skirts,      
 jackets and hats. We also have red    
 sashes to put our medals on.          
     We pratice marching two nights a  
 week at our school,and the band       
 practices once a week.
