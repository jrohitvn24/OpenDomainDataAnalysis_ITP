		<title>01Landwade Area</title>
		<content>   The area is entirely rural with only
 a tiny population. Most of the land is
 used for farming, mainly arable, but  
{Landwade Hall Farm}has sheep and      
 cattle, including rare breeds.        
   There is some industry in the area. 
 There is a big scrap works near       
 Snailwell. Of particular interest is  
 the unique{"burning tunnel"}built to  
 dispose of railway carriages about 30 
 years old, the construction of which  
 included blue asbestos, now known to  
 be a health hazard. There is also an  
 important "stud farm" at Exning.      
   There are two houses of historic    
 interest:{Landwade Hall and Fordham   
{Abbey.}Both of these have replaced    
 older buildings.                      
   There are two main roads both with  
 regular but infrequent bus services. A
 railway line carries freight and      
 passengers from Harwich to the North. </content>
