		<title>07Truscott</title>
		<content> Truscott is a small hamlet consisting 
 of some twelve dwellings.It is        
 approximately three miles from        
 Launceston and the narrow lanes       
 leading to it make it a somewhat      
 isolated community.The people living  
 there felt that the peace and quiet   
 provided by this isolation were two of
 the main attractions of living        
 there.Another reason why four families
 live there is that it is central to   
 their work-they are vets.The only     
 criticism of Truscott is that it is   
 sometimes very windy.The people living
 there consider their community to be a
 very friendly and cooperative one.They
 have even worked together to build    
 their own open air swimming pool.Most 
 of the buildings are made of local    
 stone and date back to the last       
 century or earlier.There are however a
 few more modern dwellings.            </content>
