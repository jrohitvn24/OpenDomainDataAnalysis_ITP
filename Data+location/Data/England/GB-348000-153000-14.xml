		<title>14QUARRYING ON MENDIP BENEFITS</title>
		<content>  The{Batts Combe Quarry}owned by      
 A.R.C, is the biggest single industry 
 in Cheddar and employs many of the    
 Cheddar menfolk. In comparison with   
 the quarries between{Shepton Mallet}&amp;{
{Frome,}Batts Combe Quarry is          
 relatively small. The limestone       
 produced is of a good quality. At one 
 o'clock from Mon_Fri the explosions   
 used to blast the limestone out can be
 heard. The limestone is graded and    
 used for{Concrete &amp; Tarmacadam}and    
 also supplies the{Steel Industry.}    
  A.R.C are conscious of the fact that 
 Batts Combe is in the middle of some  
 beautiful countryside.When a          
 particular section is finished with,  
 it is screened,that is landscaped and 
 replanted to blend in. Not only does  
 quarrying provide jobs &amp; money for the
 area,it provides an important         
 material used across the country.     </content>
