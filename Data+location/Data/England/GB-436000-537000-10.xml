		<title>10Wheatley Hill - Rock Farm</title>
		<content>    Rock farm was built in 1648. It is 
 three hundred and thirty seven years  
 old. It was called {Rock Farm}because 
 it was built from local stone. In all 
 it covers over {400}acres which is    
 quite large for this area.            
    The main work of the farm is in    
 dairy farming. Thirty two people are  
 emplyed to work with a large herd of  
 Fresian cows.                         
    Unlike many dairy farms who supply 
 their milk direct to a wholesale      
 dairy, Rock Farm has its own plant for
 pasteurising and bottling the milk.   
    To cope with modern feeding methods
 and production techniques, the farm   
 has installed a computer to record all
 details of dairy production. This has 
 led to savings in feedstuffs and      
 correct feeding has led to increases  
 in milk yields.
