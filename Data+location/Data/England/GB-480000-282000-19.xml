		<content> A popular event in the area is        
 the Desborough carnival which         
 first started in 1920. The carnival   
 starts off in{Dunkirk Avenue}on a     
 Saturday in June every year.There     
 are normally about sixty floats and   
 about a  hundred walking entrys, with 
 a trophy for the winning entry.There  
 is a fayre at the recreation  ground  
 after.                                
 Brookjumping is held yearly at        
{Desbororough}Brook, which is dammed   
 up at one end  to let the water  get  
 deeper. People use a rope to try and  
 swing over to the other side. If you  
 land in the water you are out. It has 
 been going on for 15 years and it is  
 a lot of fun.                         
 There is a story to do                
 with{Triangular Lodge,}near Rushton.  
 It started when two men persuaded a   
 fiddler to go down a tunnel nearby.   </content>
