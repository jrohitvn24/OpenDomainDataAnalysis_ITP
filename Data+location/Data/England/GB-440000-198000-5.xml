		<content>An old world village through which the 
main road used to run.Many of the      
inhabitants are elderly and have lived 
there all their lives.The only changes 
in the last 35 years have been the     
building of the bypass in 1972,the     
closing of the village school in 1981  
and since 1983 the building of 7 new   
houses,4 of which are on the site of   
the old coal yard.The garage used to   
be the old blacksmith's shop and       
Mr.Smith remembers when he came 20     
years ago some villagers still used    
methylated spirit lamps and cooked on  
paraffin stoves.Bunkers are visible in 
the field where villagers got water    
from a standpipe on the site of the    
windmill. The old people's club and an 
annual fete are the only organised     
recreation. The only sign of life on   
many visits were at the shop and on the
charityland allotments.                </content>
