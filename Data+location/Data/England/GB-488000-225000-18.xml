		<content> There are plenty of opportunities for 
 recreation in the Soulbury/Linslade   
 area. People enjoy gardening and the  
 Rambling Association walks the public 
 footpaths. We are just on the edge of 
 a country park, enabling people to    
 ride and hunt in te area and we also  
 have an eighteen hole golf course. A  
 major amenity is the canal with its   
 boat hire company- 250 families start 
 their holidays in Linslade each year  
 on the longboats. There is a trip-boat
 carrying up to 10,000 people a year   
 from Linslade to Three Locks. The     
 canal enables us to have an active    
 angling club and canoeing club in our 
 area and up to 300 people can be found
 jogging and walking along the towpath 
 at weekends. We also have a private   
 squash and tennis club in this        
 area.Children ride BMX bikes and skate
 boards along the pavements.           </content>
