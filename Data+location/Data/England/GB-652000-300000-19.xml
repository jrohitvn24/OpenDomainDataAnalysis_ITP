		<content> When the golf club was founded by Sir 
 John Drughorn in 1906 there were only 
 a few members then. Now there are 500 
 members, the majority being men. The  
 price of membership is Â£116 per       
 annum. This gives members the         
 opportunity to play golf any time of  
 the year.                             
    Juniors get free tuition from some 
 of the 9 paid staff. The youngest     
 member of the club is 9 &amp; the oldest  
 is 83 years old. The average age of   
 the 82 golfers is 33.                 
    Friendlies are organised &amp; through 
 these the club has had 105 play       
 individually or as a team.
