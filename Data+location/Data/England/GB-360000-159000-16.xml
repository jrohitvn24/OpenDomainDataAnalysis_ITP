		<title>16A DAY AT CLUTTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content>     I came into Class 5 at 8.55 and   
 started a maths sheet. Next we had 20 
 spellings to learn by Friday and 8    
 sentences to write, At 10.10 we went  
 into assembly. On Mondays, Mr. Small  
 congratulates the children who have   
 worked well the week before.Afterwards
 we went by coach to Midsomer Norton   
 for swimming lessons. Today we had to 
 practise lengths as part of our       
 swimming award grade 4.We got back to 
 school at 12.45 and had a short       
 playtime before having our school     
 dinner. We always have a choice. Today
 I had chicken curry and rice with     
 chocolate cake and custard for        
 pudding.After dinner we sang songs    
 from Singing Together. The Sloop John 
 B and the Banana Boat Song are my     
 favourites. After break we practised  
 the high jump as part of the          
 preparations for Sports Day.          </content>
