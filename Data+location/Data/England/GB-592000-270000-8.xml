Ixworth is once again a growing        
village; as such it is interesting to  
note the large proportion of the       
population who have lived in the       
village for only a short time.         
                                       
                                       
63% have lived here less than 15 years 
12% have lived here all their lives    
33% have lived here 5 years or less    
16% have lived here 1 year or less
