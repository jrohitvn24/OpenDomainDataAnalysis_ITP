		<content> There is a whist drive every Wednesday
 night. Twice a year they have a       
 raffle. The prizes are donated by the 
 people nearby and in the village.     
 Whist drives are well attended. They  
 are held in Baumber village hall.     
     Baumber and Hemingby used to have 
 a weekly youth club. They had snooker,
 music and table tennis. It started at 
 7.00 and ended at 9.00. Reverend Legg 
 started them both off. They had to    
 close because of lack of support.     
                                       
      A favourite hobby is gardening.  
 Most people in Baumber &amp; Hemingby have
 a garden and that is where people     
 spend their spare time.People grow    
 potatoes,  carrots, tomatoes,marrows &amp;
 many other things.People grow their   
 own because it is cheaper.In this     
 block it shows that most people prefer
 to grow their own food.{Goto page 8.  </content>
