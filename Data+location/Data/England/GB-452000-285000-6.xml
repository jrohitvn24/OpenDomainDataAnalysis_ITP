      Before our house was built a     
 chaffeurs flat and garage for Ash Tree
 House next door was on the site.      
 Nowadays we use the land for a small  
 farm in Cosby.It has three fields and 
 many buildings including a stable as  
 it was a horse stud just before we    
 moved in.Sometimes the animals we keep
 here are in quarantine before being   
 exported.These are Poll Herefords.We  
 also keep Texal and Suffolk sheep.    
 Every year one of our fields is left  
 for hay.
