		<title>10MARTELLO TOWERS</title>
		<content> The Martello Towers in Clacton serve  
 as a real reminder of the uncertain   
 history of the town and the           
 surrounding stretch of coastline. They
 were used as lookout posts, and       
 machine-gun placements during the     
 Second World War, but their history   
 goes back long before that.           
 When Napoleon was threatening to      
 overpower the rest of Europe, the     
 Martello towers ( named after their   
 originator ) were built along the     
 coastline facing South, and therefore 
 vulnerable. In reality they proved to 
 be unnecessary, but many are well     
 preserved today. One Martello Tower in
 Clacton is today used as a coastguard 
 station, a photo of which is included 
 in this information.
