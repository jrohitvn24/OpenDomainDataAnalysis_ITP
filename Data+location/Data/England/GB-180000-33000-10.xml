    In Flushing most of the buildings  
 are old and are built in terraces.The 
 Packet Captains houses line the       
 harbour and are fine examples of      
 three or four storey Georgian         
 houses.                               
    The remaining dwellings are        
 cottages of moderate size.They        
 mostly have three bedrooms a living   
 room,bathroom and a kitchen.The       
 kitchen would have had a Cornish      
 range,the other rooms would have an   
 open fire.The members of the family   
 would bath in front of the fire in the
 living room.Most cottages have now    
 been modernized,with electric cookers 
 in the kitchen and bathroom and       
 toilet.
