		<title>03HOW I GET TO SCHOOL</title>
		<content> HEWORTH                               
 I get to school by bus, but first I   
 have to get up at half past seven, get
 washed, get dressed and have breakfast
 and then watch television until twenty
 past eight then I leave the house and 
 get the bus to school. A bus is about 
 20 feet high and has two levels and   
 has four wheels and travels along a   
 road to Heworth Metro. I get a bus    
 from Heworth Metro to Heworth Grange  
 School. Heworth Metro is a station    
 where the Metro stops. The Metro is a 
 train which runs on lines and has     
 electric cables up above. Heworth     
 Metro is an interchange which means   
 you can get a Metro or British Rail   
 train or a bus to where ever you want 
 in the North East from Heworth.
