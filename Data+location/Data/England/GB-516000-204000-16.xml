		<content> There was a coach crash in France on  
 Wednesday May 29th 1985. The coach    
 started from St. Albans. There were   
 children from 2 secondary schools,    
 Beaumont and Verulam, on the coach.   
 They were on holiday in France. I knew
 one of the boys, he used to come to   
 our school. Some of them died in the  
 coach. Others survived. Some broke    
 their legs and their backs. The coach 
 went on to gravel and rolled over.    
 They went to hospital. When their     
 parents heard they took an emergency  
 flight and went to France.            
 Everyone in St. Albans feels sorry for
 them and is trying to help them by    
 raising money to give to the Schools  
 Disaster Fund. We are trying to help  
 them because their schools are near   
 our school.
