		<content>  ROCKHAMPTON,the village that lies in 
the centre of the D block is situated  
about 3 kilometres to the NNE of       
Thornbury in the County of Avon. The   
parish lies on the Avon/Gloucestershire
border.                                
  It is a sparsely populated area in   
Avon,the number of people living there 
being about 150.                       
  The area is predominantly            
agricultural with the majority of      
farmers concentrating on beef,mutton   
and dairy produce. Most of the land is 
used for grazing.                      
  Only a few minor roads cross the area
but the main A38 Trunk road cuts the SE
corner of the block.                   
  Two Government establishments have   
been placed to the east. They are the  
HM Detention Centre for young offenders
and The Hospital Estate Management and 
Engineering Centre at Eastwood Park.   </content>
