		<title>16St.Nicholas Parish Church.</title>
		<content>This parish church in Chislehurst has  
been described as a 15th century church
of rough flints and was partly rebuilt 
and restored after a fire in the bell  
chamber in 1857.Parts of the church are
Saxon.The church is on the common and  
the school is nearby.in 1985 the vault 
under the Scadbury Chapel was opened. A
search was being made for some document
which were supposed to prove that      
Francis Bacon wrote Shakespeare's      
plays.Nothing was found.               
The church is still in use every Sunday
and during the week.It has a peal of   
six bells which are still in use.Bell- 
ringing festivals are sometimes held   
there.
