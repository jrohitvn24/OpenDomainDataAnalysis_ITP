		<title>08"BANGER RACING"</title>
		<content> One of the most exciting forms of     
{recreation}in the area takes place on 
 waste ground in Parkeston: this is    
{"banger Racing".}Quite a few people go
 to watch this although they weren't   
 too sure whether they were looking for
 skilllful driving or hoping to see    
 plenty of crashes! Anyway they were   
 able to see both with the cars        
 speeding round the track and smashing 
 into each other until the race        
 finishes. Those who went regularly    
 said that it was a very exciting      
 sport,although one person had been    
 badly burned just recently. All of    
 them said that they would keep going. 
  One local team is from the{Harwich   
{School.}Part of the work of the       
 metalwork department is to convert old
 cars into "banger racers" and race    
 them.
