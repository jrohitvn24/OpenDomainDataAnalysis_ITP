		<content>The woods in the Woodcote/Checkendon   
area are mainly beech with some pines  
we saw only one oak. The biggest wood  
is Gallowstree common where many trees 
are being felled. The Economical       
Forestry of Caversham own most of the  
woods. They experimented with conifer  
planted near Beech Farm. But it was    
decided that they might take over the  
whole area and now only deciduous trees
are now being replanted. Most of the   
existing beechwood is used in the      
furniture industry in High Wycombe. The
woods are cool and brambles,ferns and  
rhododendrons cover the ground.
