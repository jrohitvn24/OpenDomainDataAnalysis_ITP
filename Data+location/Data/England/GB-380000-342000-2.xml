		<content>On Saturday 11th of May I got up at    
7.15 am &amp; went downstairs.I read a     
book &amp; watched the T.V. until          
breakfast.For breakfast I had All Bran,
Branflakes,orange &amp; tea.After a wash I 
dressed and came down.I put on my shoes
&amp; coat,took three pounds from my money 
box &amp; went shopping with my family. We 
went to Newcastle &amp; parked in the Multi
-storey car park.Then we went to the   
Roebuck centre &amp; looked at the Lego    
toys in Boots where Dad bought a film  
for his camera.Then we went to John    
Menzies where I bought a toy.Later we  
went to Nanna's (my grandmother) for an
hour.I had a drink of lemonade &amp; a     
piece of cake.At home I had faggots,   
chips &amp; peas for dinner.Later I watched
Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (a film
about a space hero) while eating salad.
I played out with my friends &amp; went to 
bed at 9 o'clock.                      </content>
