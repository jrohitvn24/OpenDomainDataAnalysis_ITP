		<title>17The Cabinet Maker,Stebbing.</title>
		<content> The cabinet maker's is a business,    
 which makes reproduction furniture    
 such as tables.Their timber is        
 bought all over the world.They use    
 many kinds of wood including mahogany,
 walnut and yew.Most of their machines 
 incorporate saws or cutters.The       
 craftsmen have to be very skilled to  
 work with the wood.                   
  Veneer is one of their materials.It  
 is slices of wood .6mm thick.The      
 veneer is glued to chipboard by       
 compression.Then it is used to make   
 different types of furniture.         
  The furniture is made to look old    
 by denting it with a rock and then    
 staining it.The stain runs into the   
 dents and makes the furniture look    
 dirty and old.They rub it with very   
 fine sandpaper to make it look as if  
 it has been dusted for centuries.They 
 make beautiful furniture there.       </content>
