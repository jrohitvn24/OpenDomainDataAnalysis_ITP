		<content> The total population of the area is   
 sixty, and there are twenty-six       
 dwellings, one vacant. Ten people live
 in farm dwellings close together      
 forming the NE corner of the village  
 of Ogbourne St. George, in the valley,
 205739. The remaining fifty live in   
 the isolated farmsteads and their     
 cottages spread over the high parts of
 the area. Apart from one new isolated 
 farmhouse, 206734, the dwellings, or  
 cluster of dwellings, lie at eight    
 sites at approximately 1000m.         
 intervals. Five sites are working     
 farms, including the lands surrounding
 the remaining farmhouse which is now  
 used as a weekend cottage. Not all the
 fifty inhabitants are employed on the 
 farms, nor do all the farm workers    
 live in the area.
