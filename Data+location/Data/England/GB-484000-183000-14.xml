		<title>14BISHAM ABBEY SPORTS CENTRE.</title>
		<content>   Bisham Sports Centre is situated in 
 the grounds of Bisham Abbey, near the 
 River Thames, to the south of Marlow. 
   There are two parts to the Centre;  
 the older buildings being used for    
 conferences, and nearby is the new    
 sports complex. Many national teams   
 come to Bisham to train because of the
 superb facilities. When we visited the
 Centre in June, the national Weight   
 Lifting team were training there. The 
 Centre is also the base for a tennis  
 school, which trains young players.   
   Many people think that the Centre is
 haunted by the ghost of a Dame        
 Elizabeth Hoby. There is a large      
 painting of her in the Centre, and    
 when it was taken down recently       
 strange things started happening in   
 the Centre. These strange events      
 stopped as soon as the painting was   
 replaced.                             </content>
