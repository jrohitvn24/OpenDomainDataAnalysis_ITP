 Modern industry is often found on     
{Industrial Estates}. Amington Heath   
Industrial Estate is one of Tamworth's 
new areas of industrial development.   
People are employed at these modern    
factories doing such jobs as making    
paint and processing foods. There are  
also a number of small business units  
where people have small motor car      
garages. There are also {distribution  
centres} where goods are stored and    
sent around the Midlands.              
 The people who work on the Estate     
tend to come from the new Glascote     
Heath, Stoneydelph and Amington Heath  
areas of Tamworth. The Amington Heath  
Industrial Estate is situated on a     
good {modern routeway} the B5000 and   
has easy access to the Watling Street  
and the new M42 motorway.
