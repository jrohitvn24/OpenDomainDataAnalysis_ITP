         VISIT WILLINGTON              
 IF YOU COME TO VISIT YOU CAN BUY FOOD 
 AT THE SHOP OR GO TO "THE CROWN".IT IS
 IN STATION ROAD BECAUSE WE USED TO    
 HAVE A RAILWAY.TURN RIGHT AT THE      
 BOTTOM AND YOU GO ALONG CHAPEL LANE.  
 THE CHAPEL WAS MOVED THERE FROM CROOTS
 FARM ON ROLLERS IN 1867 AND THEN      
 BRICKED ROUND.YOU CAN GO ON TO        
 MOWSBURY PLACE AND A PATH TAKES YOU TO
 THE LOCK AND WEIR.IF YOU HAD TURNED   
 LEFT ALONG CHURCH ROAD YOU WOULD GO   
 PAST THE SCHOOL .ONE OF THE HOUSES WAS
 A DOVECOTE BUT JOHN GOSTWICK HAD A BIG
 ONE BUILT TO KEEP 1500 DOVES IN WHEN  
 HENRY VIII CAME TO VISIT WILLINGTON IN
 1541.                                 
 IF YOU BRING YOUR CHILDREN THEY CAN   
 PLAY ON THE SWINGS AND SLIDE.ALL THE  
 ROADS ARE NAMED AFTER FAMOUS PEOPLE   
 WHO LIVED HERE.IT IS PEACEFUL.        </content>
