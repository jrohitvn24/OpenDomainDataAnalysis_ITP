		<content> are a number of brick buildings (esp. 
 on the council estate and Old People's
 sheltered accomodation). The          
 population of the village is now      
 stable and there are plenty of        
 children (although no school as the   
 primary school closed three years     
 ago). There are many people who live  
 in the village who work for the Trust 
 (see above) but there are an          
 increasing number who work in         
 Stamford, Grantham, Bourne and        
 Peterborough. There is an increasing  
 number of 'new people' in the village.
 The main road through the village is a
 B road but there is not a lot of      
 traffic. What traffic there is tends  
 to be asociated with the village and  
 the farms in the area.
