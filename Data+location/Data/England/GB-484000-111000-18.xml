   TRUNDLE TO SINGLETON CHURCH         
 Starting just north of the Trundle    
 one goes down a small lane and onto a 
 footpath.This leads through a field   
 in which wheat is grown,then the      
 field thins out and there is a        
 stile.Then,a track leads down past a  
 line of trees and the view all around 
 is good-many things are visible,such  
 as chalk pits in the side of the downs
 ,and the church at the bottom of the  
 hill.As one approaches the church     
 one is confronted by a large slope    
 which leads to the rear entrance to   
 the church.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
