		<content> The area is{agricultural}therefore the
 major trade is{farming.}Many farmers  
 have licences to sell their products  
 on stalls, either on the farm or in   
 lay-bys by the Gloucester to Chepstow 
 road. There one can buy produce such  
 as apples, plums, strawberries and    
 tomatoes. On the north side of the    
 river there is a{stable}which trades  
 in horses. A similar situation in     
 trade exists on the south side of the 
 river.The nearest{factory}was         
 Cadbury's at Frampton but that was    
 sold off into smaller units. Shoppers 
 have to go elsewhere because of lack  
 of facilities. They may get basic     
 foodstuffs at Arlingham, Saul or      
 Frampton. The population on both sides
 of the river needs to travel to       
 Gloucester, Stroud or Lydney for most 
 shopping.
