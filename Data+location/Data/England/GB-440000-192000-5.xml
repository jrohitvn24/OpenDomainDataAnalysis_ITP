		<content>{Kitchens.}                            
We think that the kitchen is the most  
important part of the house. As well as
family meals that are made there, it is
the room where Mums spend a lot of     
time.Most of our class have a lot of   
equipment in their family kitchens.As  
well as cookers, fridges,kettles,mixers
and washing machines a lot of          
households now have microwave cookers .
{Mealtimes}                            
During the week families do not eat    
many of their meals together. Sunday is
the best day of the week for most of   
us,this is because there is more time  
to enjoy the meal and most of the      
family is together.                    
{Leisure.}                             
Most people today have a television and
radio.More people now own video and    
homecomputers.
