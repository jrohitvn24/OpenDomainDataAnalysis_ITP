		<content> Across the S.W. corner of grid.ref.   
550140 runs the course of a mineral    
railway which linked Welch Whittle     
Colliery(previously known as           
Darlington's Pit) to the main line at  
Clancutt (Grid Ref.563150).Timothy     
Hackworth's locomotive "Sans Pareil",  
which took part in the Rainhill Trials 
(1829),finished its working life on the
mineral railways in Coppull.Mining has 
in the past,played an important part in
the local economy.Since 1722, 18 pits  
sunk in vicinity of Coppull.Last to    
close was Chisnall Hall Mine in 1966.  
On 22nd. May 1852, a roof fall at this 
colliery claimed 33 lives.             
  As a by-product of mining,the clay   
soils gave rise to brick manufacture.  
This industry declined following       
closure of the mines.However the local 
brick is still much in evidence in the 
housing of the district.               </content>
