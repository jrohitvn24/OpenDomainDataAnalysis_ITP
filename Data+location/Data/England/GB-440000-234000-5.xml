Emma and I interviewed Mrs Huntriss to 
see how the village has changed in the 
thirty years she has been here. The    
traffic has built enormousley not only 
in quantity but in size.It cuts the    
village in half and it is very         
dangerous.More than half the people you
meet are strangers now.The population  
is 3000 and still growing.In the past  
the neighbours knew when people were   
ill or needed help.The village museum  
is an attempt to reflect the life of   
the village's past.A few rows of       
cottages have disappeared along Hawk   
Lane and the Bowling Green.The shops   
in the High Street used to be derelict 
gardens.
