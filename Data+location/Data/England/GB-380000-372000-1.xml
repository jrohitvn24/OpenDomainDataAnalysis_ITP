		<content> This block(03800372) appears to be    
 about the village{Chelford}but,as page
 2 reveals, the village heart has      
 moved. The present village is         
 dissected by the Northern boundary of 
 the block. The Commercial part(the    
 only bank,shops,etc) is in this block 
 but the main housing is in the block  
 to the North.The block is mainly      
 farming with some sand extraction.    
 Most people commute out to work. The  
 land is well wooded with ponds and    
 lakes. Two major roads -the Knutsford 
 to Macclesfield A537 and the Alderley 
 Edge to Holmes Chapel A535 - cross at 
 a roundabout at the site of the       
 original village. The main Manchester 
 to Crewe railway crosses to the N.W.  
 corner where the station can be found.
 There has been considerable population
 growth in the last ten years.
