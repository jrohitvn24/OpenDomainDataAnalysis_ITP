		<content> When a doctor is needed one must go   
 to Winslow, Stony Stratford, Bletchley
 or Buckingham for consultation. People
 without transport do have problems but
 being a friendly neighbourhood a lift 
 is usually available. One person helps
 regularly by collecting and delivering
 prescriptions.                        
 Hospitals include Stoke Mandeville,   
 Northampton and the new Milton Keynes.
 Specialised facilities such as child  
 care, X-Rays, etc. are at Health      
 Centres in nearby towns. Dental care  
 is also available in these towns.     
 A mobile breast screening unit was    
 recently in this area.                
 Other services, particularly for the  
 elderly and infirm include district   
 nurses, meals on wheels, home help and
 transport to Day Centres. The Willen  
 Hospice at Milton Keynes cared for one
 of our residents before her death.    </content>
