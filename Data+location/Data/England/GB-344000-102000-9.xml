		<content>  Carp are found in weedy and lily     
 infested water,these are big fish that
 grow up to two feet long and eat the  
 weed from these pools that have little
 flow to clean them.                   
  Eels are found in the mud pools      
 shallows of marshy ground or          
 streams.These are sometimes eaten in  
 jelly or in a pie.They have been known
 to find their way into trout pools    
 through cleanage pipes.               
  Roach,pike,dace and bream are found  
 in the rivers they are only small     
 because they leave for bigger rivers  
 when they are older.                  
  As well as all the fish that have    
 been mentioned,the marshland,rivers,  
 streams and the muddy patches of our  
 area have got life in them.These      
 places are where amphibious creatures 
 such as toads,newts and frogs live.
