		<content>   There are 3 farms in the area. There
 are 18 houses in the area. It is not  
 likely to change much. The water in   
 the mere is used for drinking water   
 for cattle and for Ellesmere fishing  
 club and canoeing.                    
   There are 2 bus stops and a mobile  
 library. Mr Mainwaring owns most of   
 the land. They used to walk down to   
 the mere with buckets to wash         
 themselves, they put chemicals in     
 every year to stop the weed growing.  
 The cottages did not have any water or
 electricity untill 60 years ago. All  
 the water was collected into barrels  
 from the down pipes of sheds. The coal
 sheds used to be pig stys. When the   
 pig died it was jointed and hung in   
 the houses.
