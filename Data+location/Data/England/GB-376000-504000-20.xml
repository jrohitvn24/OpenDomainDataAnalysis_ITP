		<content> WE FREQUENTLY RETURN TO NATEBY AND    
 WHARTON, WHERE WE ARE WARMLY WELCOMED 
 BY EVERYONE WE MEET. WHETHER WE       
 APPROACH FROM HAWES, SEDBERGH OR      
 BROUGH, THE SENSATION OF BEING A PART 
 OF THIS SMALL COMMUNITY IS ALWAYS     
 PRESENT;  A COMMUNITY WHOSE HOMES     
 NESTLE IN THE FOLDS OF CURVING LIME-  
 STONE HILLS. UNKNOWN TO MOST PEOPLE,  
 BYPASSED BY MANY, NATEBY AND WHARTON  
 PROVIDE FOR US A HAVEN OF PASTORAL    
 QUIET AND BEAUTY DIFFICULT TO MATCH.  
 HERE, THE HILLS DO 'GIRD OUR DWELLINGS
 ROUND', AND BEYOND THEM, THE FELLS    
 INVITE ONE TO VENTURE FORTH ON FOOT.  
 OUR REWARD, AS WE CLIMB TO THE HEIGHTS
 IS THE MUSIC OF TUMBLING WATER IN THE 
 BECKS AND GILLS, THE BLEAT OF EWE AND 
 LAMB, AND THE VIEW OF DISTANT MOUNTAIN
 CARESSED BY FLEECY CLOUD.
