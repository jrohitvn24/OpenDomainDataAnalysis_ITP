		<content>      Leading down the south side of   
 Durlston Castle is a footpath to the  
 "Great Globe".                        
      It is a scale model of the world 
 made from Portland stone. Positioned  
 on a south facing slope, it commands  
 excellent south and east facing views 
 of the English Channel.               
      The Globe weighs 40 tons and is  
 made up of 15 separate pieces. It was 
 made in Greenwich, London, in 1889,   
 and took 2 years to build.            
      It was transported to Durlston in
 1891,where it took two months to      
 assemble.                             
      The Globe is surrounded by an    
 iron fence and twelve London street   
 bollards.                             
      Eight stone seats marking compass
 points surround the Globe.
