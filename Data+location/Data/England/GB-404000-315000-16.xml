Lea Hall Colliery is one of the most   
modern pits in the world. It was       
started in 1954 when they began        
sinking two shafts near the railway    
and the River Trent. Most of the coal  
mines in the area were getting old and 
there was not much coal left. It cost  
14 million pounds. Rugeley "A" power   
station was planned at the same time   
so that the coal could be transported  
directly to it by conveyor belt. The   
first production of coal started in    
1960. There are now 7 coal faces in    
use.When work started local people     
were used, later skilled workers were  
transferred from the other coalfields  
on the Chase,and other parts of        
the country. As a result new housing   
estates were built in Rugeley and      
Handsacre. There are 1793 underground  
workers and 345 surface workers.       </content>
