		<content> Most of the traffic passing through   
 the district travels along the Rushden
 to{Bedford road,}designated on        
 motoring maps as the 'A6'.            
                                       
 By contrast,{Forty Foot Lane,}a drove 
 road, is a grassy tract used only by  
 farm traffic -it is so little used    
 that people have been known to grow   
 cabbages and sunflowers on it.        
                                       
 Souldrop{village roads}were loose     
 stone until the late 1920's when gangs
 of men came with watering cans of hot 
 tar, barrows of gravel and a steam-   
 roller. The surface lasted until 1983,
 when the high street was re-tarred and
 gritted.  The knapper's stone, still  
 visible near Lamb's Cottage is a      
 reminder of the days when the road    
 workers had to sit and split up       
 rocks for the roads.                  </content>
