		<title>06DAIRY FARMING-LILLESHALL</title>
		<content> Out of the four farms visited only one
 was completely {Dairy.}It was 90 acres
 so the fields were smaller making it  
 unsuitable for big machinery.Because  
 of the 76 cattle and silage it is     
 rather smelly.There was one full-time 
 and one part-time worker.He had       
 tractors,silage harvesters as well as 
 a milking parlour,dairy,barns, calf   
 sheds.                                
{Mixed.}The mixed farm we visited had  
 an acreage of 470.The farmer keeps 97 
 cattle,milking 3 times a day.He has 65
 sheep and also grows wheat,oats,barley
 ,maize,lucerne,peas as well as silage 
 for the cattle.He has 4 full-time and 
 1 part-time workmen.He has a milking  
 parlour,barns,calf sheds,cattle sheds 
 and a silage shed as well as his      
 machinery.
