		<title>11Godwin's Peat Works (1)</title>
		<content>   The peat has to go through five     
 processes before it is sold to the    
 customer. They are{cutting, grinding, 
{sterilising,}the addition of{lime}and 
{fertiliser}and finally bagging.       
                                       
{1. THE CUTTING OF THE PEAT.}          
   A machine cuts a slice of peat from 
 the ground. One side of the slice is  
 cut off and comes out of a chute. The 
 peat inside the machine gets cut into 
 nine blocks and gets stacked into a   
 neat line. The peat that is in the    
 pile gets moved into another pile so  
 that the blocks on the bottom can dry.
 When the peat is dry it is taken to   
 the peat works. When the peat dries it
 gets lighter in both colour and       
 weight.                               
{2.  GRINDING }                        
   Before the peat can be used it has  
 to be ground up into small pieces.    </content>
