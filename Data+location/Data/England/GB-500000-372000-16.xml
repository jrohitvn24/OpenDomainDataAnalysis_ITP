		<title>16THE FORCES:CHERRY WILLINGHAM</title>
		<content>   There is an army cadet group in     
 Cherry Willingham with a hut in the   
 grounds of the comprehensive school.  
 They meet once a week and practice on 
 the school field.                     
   The navy has no direct activity in  
 our block although the R.A.F. Nimrod  
 passes over about five or six times a 
 day. It is  based at a local R.A.F.   
 station and Cherry Willingham is on   
 the flight path for the planes. In all
 there are up to 70 planes a day over  
 the area most of them being R.A.F.    
 fighter planes. We also have the 'Red 
 Arrows' team over the area at least   
 once a week if they are not away      
 giving a performance.                 
  Some of the members of the Royal     
 Observer Corps, which has a station   
 just outside our block live in the    
 the area.
