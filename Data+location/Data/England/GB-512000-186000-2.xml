		<content> THERE ARE VARIOUS SUGGESTIONS AS TO   
 HOW HARROW GOT ITS NAME BUT THE MOST  
 GENERALLY ACCEPTED ONE IS THAT IT     
 COMES FROM THE ANGLO-SAXON WORD{HEARH 
 MEANING A HILL SANCTUARY.IN THE       
 ORIGINAL{DOMESDAY}OF 1086 HARROW IS   
 RECORDED AS BELONGING TO LANFRANC,    
 ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY AND AS HAVING
 A PRIEST,3 KNIGHTS AND THEIR 7        
 TENANTS, 102 VILLEINS (PEASANTS) 2    
 COTTAGERS  AND 2 SERFS. ITS LANDS     
 AMOUNTED TO NEARLY 13,000 ACRES.      
 HARROW REMAINED AS A VILLAGE UNTIL    
 AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR WHEN SUDDEN 
 EXPANSION INTO THE SUBURBS TOOK PLACE.
 THE METROPOLITAN RAILWAY CO.HAD A     
 MAJOR EFFECT ON HARROW'S GROWTH WITH  
 ITS{METROLAND}ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN    
 EXTOLLING THE VIRTUES OF SUBURBAN     
 LIVING WITH EASY ACCESS TO LONDON.
