		<content>{Wink Murder.}The children stand in a  
 circle.One person is secretly picked  
 to be the murderer without the others 
 knowing.If you are winked at then you 
 lie down as if dead.The person who    
 finds out who the murderer is without 
 being killed herself is the winner.   
{Ladders.}Two people sit facing        
 each other with their legs in front of
 them  and in a line of other          
 pairs.Each pair is numbered and when  
 the number is called out the pair must
 run up the line jumping over the legs 
 and then run back to their place.The  
 first of the pair back wins a point.  
{Whirly.}Players stand in a circle and 
 are numbered 1,2,3,4 or 5.When a      
 number is called those with that      
 number must go round twice trying to  
 touch the other runners before        
 returning to their place.When touched,
 the player must sit down.             </content>
