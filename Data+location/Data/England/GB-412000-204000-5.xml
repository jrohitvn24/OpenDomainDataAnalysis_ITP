		<content> During the next five centuries        
 the numbers in the villages rose      
 steadily until the late nineteenth    
 and early twentieth century when the  
 numbers were at a maximum. At this    
 time there were more than four hundred
 adults in{Quenington.}                
 Another indication of the change in   
 the numbers is that at this time      
 each village had its own school with  
 some sixty pupils aged five to        
 eleven.Today there are less than      
 fifty five children in the three      
 villages and only one school.         
  Families have got much smaller; in   
 the school admission register for the 
 last century families of eight or more
 were quite common. Today the largest  
 family in Hatherop Primary School has 
 four children.
