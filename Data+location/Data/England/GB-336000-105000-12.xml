		<title>12   A SCHOOL TRIP IN 1985</title>
		<content> On Friday morning at School we were   
 going on our School trip.We went on a 
 bus to Dorchester.At Dorchester we    
 went into the Museum we saw some      
 slides about Maiden Castle.Maiden     
 Castle is a very big hill fort.There  
 are dips in it called ramparts.In the 
 Museum there are real skeletons that  
 were dug up in the 1930's.We went to  
 Maiden Castle and we walked nearly all
 around it.We went into a dip and then 
 we climbed up the ramparts and down a 
 chalkway then we went back to the     
 bus.On the pathway there was a wire   
 track.Then we went to Weymouth.Some of
 us swam in the sea and the others went
 into the arcades.After that we all    
 went on the Swing Boats.I went realy  
 high.then we were allowed to choose   
 weather we would go on the trampolines
 or the donkeys.I went on the donkeys  
 with my friends.Then we went home.    </content>
