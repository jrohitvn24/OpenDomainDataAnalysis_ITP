		<content> Johnson and Nephew is a wire          
 manufacturer in Ambergate.It was built
 in 1876.The person who owned it was   
 Richard Johnson. When he retired his  
 nephew took over,thats how it got its 
 name. There are three diffrent types  
 of wire. The welding wire is used for 
 bridges ,and cars, the thick wire is  
 used for thick strong bridges and the 
 normal wire is used for bed springs,  
 spokes and hair grips.The factory     
 employs 401 people.                   
 The River Derwent runs under the      
 factory and was used to drive the     
 turbines,but now larger electricity   
 generators are used.There was a new   
 weir in 1948 after a fire destroyed   
 the factory roofs.The biggest coils of
 wire weigh 2.25 tons.The smallest     
 coils are 50 kilos.Altogether,there is
 50,260,000 tons sold a year.
