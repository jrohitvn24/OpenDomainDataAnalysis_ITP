founded in 1919 &amp; was housed in a      
building on the Green which is still   
used as a store.  The present premises 
were opened in 1951.  They sell &amp;      
repair farm &amp; garden machinery.        
Also in the village is the Apple       
Growers Association building, which is

centre for local fruit growers.
