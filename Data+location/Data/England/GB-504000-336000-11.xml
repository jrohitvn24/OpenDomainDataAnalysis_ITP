		<title>11ST.BOTOLPHS CHURCH, NEWTON.</title>
		<content> Domesday 1086 records a church in     
 Newton.St.Botolph was a medieval saint
 said to have founded Boston.The main  
 building is late 14th century but has 
 earlier fragments as well as later    
 work.Its Victorian interior dates from
 a restoration of 1868.Its tower has   
 5 bells,the oldest from 1595 and 3 of 
 the others being cast from 2 other    
 early bells.In 1983 the tower had     
 massive repairs costing Â£10000 and    
 grants obtained by the Rector,a large 
 donation from the patron and Â£1000    
 raised by village events paid for     
 this.This year the organ has been     
 restored and so far Â£400 has been     
 raised.Under the 2 churchwardens      
 almost everyone takes part in church  
 care both inside and out.
