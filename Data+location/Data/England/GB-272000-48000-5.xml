		<title>05THE MOUNTS</title>
		<content> Mounts, or The Mounts as it is usually
 known, is a rather straggling small   
 settlement built along the only main  
 road in the survey area, the A 381    
 Totnes to Kingsbridge road.           
 Several of the older houses have walls
 protected by hung slates, a testimony 
 to the high exposed position of the   
 settlement.                           
 Only two of the houses date from      
 before the turn of century. Six       
 council houses are at the northern end
 and at the southern end are two quite 
 modern houses.                        
 There is no church, shop or school,   
 East Allington, a mile to the east,   
 provides these services.              
 There is a public telephone box and a 
 letter box. Also there is a daily bus 
 service to Kingsbridge and Totnes.    
 There is a camping and caravan site, a
 skip hire service and a haulage firm. </content>
