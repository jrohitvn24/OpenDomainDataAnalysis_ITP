		<title>20BIOGRAPHY - FAMOUS PEOPLE</title>
		<content>     Liphook has housed quite a few    
 famous people. Flore Thompson used to 
 live in the old Post Office, which is 
 now the Midland Bank. Here she wrote  
 her book Lark Rise to Candleford,     
 which one of the roads in Liphook was 
 named after (Lark Rise).              
     Liphook has been visited by       
 royalty as well. During her reign     
 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert came,
 and stayed at The Anchor which        
 changed its name to the Royal Anchor. 
 Also Princess Anne used to come here  
 to Stocklands and Downlands, our      
 Riding Stables, for horse shows and   
 other horse events.                   
    The actor Boris Karloff, who played
 parts as Count Dracula, also lived    
 here in Bramshott.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
