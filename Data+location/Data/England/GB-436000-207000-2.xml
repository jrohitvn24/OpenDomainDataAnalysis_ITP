		<title>02  How Cogges is changing</title>
		<content> Cogges was once quite separate from   
Witney. It used to be an important,    
self-contained village but then got    
smaller. After many years Witney has   
grown, and now Cogges has become part  
of Witney and is now called Witney.    
 After 1066 when William the Conqueror 
had conquered England he gave one of   
his friends, a knight named Wadard,    
(shown on the Bayeau Tapestry) all of  
this land where we are. An estate,     
Wadard's Meadow, is named after him.   
There were an ancient priory a church  
and many houses and cottages. Now there
is not much left of old Cogges just a  
few of the major buildings. The new    
housing estates are really seen as part
of Witney and people go to Witney for  
their shopping. A new school was built 
4 years ago, Now roads have been built 
and a new road bridge is planned as now
people have to use the footbridge.     </content>
