		<title>05A MENDIP ARABLE FARM 2</title>
		<content> The farmer at Priddy Hill Farm used to
 farm on lower land in Wiltshire. He   
 reports that the soil on Mendip is    
 more productive despite being stony   
 but snow can lead to access problems  
  n Winter and mist and fog are        
 frequent hazards. The farmer tries to 
 grow a variety of crops and avoids    
 monoculture. Seed is expensive and the
 farmer is experimenting to find       
 varieties of wheat and barley which   
 enjoy the conditions of the plateau;  
 old varieties are deliberately pursued
 as well as new{hybrids.}Although the  
 farmer has only farmed the area for a 
 short time he obviously enjoys his    
 work and understands the need for     
 careful management. He is keen to     
 experiment but is also aware of the   
 need to conserve{soil fertility.}
