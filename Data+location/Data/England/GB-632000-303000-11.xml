		<content> There are not many tourists,the few   
 that there are stay mainly near       
 Buckenham Ferry.Most of the houses are
 fairly modern,built in the 50's 60's &amp;
 70's,these consist of mainly bungalows
 along the road,and older terraced     
 houses off the road,around the village
 green.There were a few really old     
 buildings,dating back to the 1850's.  
 The old village barn,has recently been
 renovated and modernised.
