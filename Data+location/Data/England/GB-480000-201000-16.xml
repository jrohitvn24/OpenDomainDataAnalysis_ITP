		<title>16DAY CENTRE, PRINCES RISBOR;</title>
		<content>The Day Centre is for elderly people of
the Princes Risborough area who either 
live on their own or with their        
children and would not normally get out
of their homes.                        
The number of people who help with the 
running of the Day Centre is about 35, 
including Ambulance drivers. It has    
been running now for 6 years in the    
same place, but they will soon be      
moving to new premises probably in the 
next month. The average number of      
people that come for the 3 days that   
it opens is about 18 and it is always  
a different group each time. The Lady  
who runs the centre has been incharge  
now for 5 years.                       
The Lunchtime meal that they have is   
provided by the canteen at the         
Secondary School. The Day Centre       
organises outside activities such as   
day trips to Cathedrals and Theatres.  </content>
