		<content> be inhabited by people who work in the
 surrounding towns.                    
  {The Roebuck Inn}situated at the     
 junction of five country lanes has    
 been a meeting place for the local    
 people for many years. Today it is as 
 popular as ever with both local people
 and with the town dwellers of Oldham  
 who drive out of town into the        
 countryside for a pleasant evening of 
 eating and drinking.                  
  {Badger Edge}is a hill rising to a   
 height of over 1,200 feet (380 metres)
 and dominates the area. To the north  
 there is a panoramic view over the    
 Tame Valley towards Denshaw and the   
 Pennines, with the valley side falling
 away steeply down to the river.       
   The area has a bleak appearance with
 mainly rough grazing land, a few      
 isolated dwellings and a marked       
 absence of trees.                     </content>
