		<title>02CHEBSEY, A FARMING COMMUNITY</title>
		<content> Our area is predominantly a farming   
 community.  It is tight knit and      
 several of the farmers are related to 
 one another.  They socialise amongst  
 themselves and perhaps have met their 
 marital partners at a Young Farmers   
 Club.                                 
 Some farmers are self-sufficient in   
 milk.  There are no local shops so    
 shopping is done mainly in Eccleshall.
 The farmer's wife helps at busy times,
 for example feeding new-born calves.  
 They may also deal with travelling    
 salesmen, sometimes 2 or 3 a week.    
 The current price of land is about    
 Â£2000 an acre, a 90 horse power       
 tractor is about Â£16,000.  One of our 
 farmers owns 4 tractors, a combine, a 
 forage harvester, mower, 3            
 grain/silage tractors, 3 lorries (for 
 straw), ploughs, cultivators and finds
 his fork-lift truck invaluable.       </content>
