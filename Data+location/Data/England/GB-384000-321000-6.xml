In  such  a  rural  area,  the   Parish
Council  plays  an  important  role  in
settling  local  disputes  and  dealing
with local issues. Members of the local
Parish  Council are often also  members
of  the District Councils. The  benefit
of  this is that Parish matters can  be
put  into a wider and more  influential
context.                               
In  Ranton Parish, for  example,  there
are  three hundred names in the  Parish
Register  as  opposed to 140  in  1947.
Meetings   are  held  monthly  in   the
Village  Hall. Councillors are  elected
every  four  years  but  as  there  are
usually few new candidates  forthcoming
the  personnel  of the  Parish  Council
becomes well-established.
