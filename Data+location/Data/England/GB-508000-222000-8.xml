		<title>08LEASIDE WALK</title>
		<content> The river Lea is not straight and not 
 deep. Some of the grass is cut and    
 some is not. In the long grass are    
 trees including silverbirch, very big 
 weeping willows and elderberry. There 
 is a little ditch, a bridge and       
 stinging nettles. In the river are    
 frogs, fish and water moles. We also  
 saw a copse (little wood). In the park
 there is a sports ground used for     
 racing, hockey, cricket and it has ten
 terraces. There is also a big         
 rectangular garden, a rose garden, a  
 rock garden, and a shrub garden. There
 are apple trees, pink, purple, red,   
 white and yellow petunias. The path we
 walk along is made of bark chippings  
 and a style leads us back to the side 
 walk.
