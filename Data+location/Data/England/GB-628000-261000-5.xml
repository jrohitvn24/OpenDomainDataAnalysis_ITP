		<content>Sir Robert Hitcham was a 17th century  
lawyer who bought the castle and its   
estates. A bachelor,he left much of his
money in trust to be spent building 12 
almshouses for old people and a school 
for poor children. Eight people remain 
as trustees, four from the Town Council
and four from Pembroke College, where  
Sir Robert was a student. The money is 
invested and Mr. Baker,Treasurer of the
Trust and Mrs. Ward, the Clerk keep the
accounts. The almshouses have recently 
had the central heating modernised. It 
costs about $10,000 a year to run the  
almshouses including free heating,     
lighting, repairs, insurance and the   
wages for a warden. One or two persons 
can rent an almshouse for $9.30 a week.
The school we attend is named after Sir
Robert; we still receive extra money   
from the trust. Sir Robert's tomb can  
be seen in the chancel of the church.  </content>
