 40 salesmen around the country.They   
 make aluminium windows and have a     
 factory in Consett which makes P.V.C  
 windows.The company started in Grimsby
 7 yrs.ago but moved to Caistor where  
 the managers lived and then bought the
 Nettleton site.In 1983 they opened the
 Consett factory for selling to        
 Scotland.The windows are assembled in 
 the factories,delivered to warehouses 
 all over the country and then         
 installed by local fixing gangs.      
 Transport from Nettleton to the rest  
 of the country is easy via the M18,   
 M180,M62,M1 and A1.Most orders are    
 local or off the A1 but as time       
 progresses more orders are coming from
 further afield.
