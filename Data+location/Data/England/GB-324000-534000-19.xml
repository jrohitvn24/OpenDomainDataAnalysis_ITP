		<title>19Overwater Tarn</title>
		<content> Overwater is the largest tarn in      
 Northern Lakeland.Because of its quiet
 situation it is appreciated by the    
 tourists who penetrate this secluded  
 area.Over the years many large pike   
 have been caught in it,it also has    
 small perch,it is little fished today.
 There are many wild fowl and in Winter
 migrant birds from the Arctic areas.  
 Overwater Hall, known as Whitefield   
 House for many years,is now a hotel.It
 was built in 1840 on the site of an   
 ancient manor farm by Joseph Gillbanks
 who  made a fortune in the West       
 Indies.In a nearby field is a         
 sandstone rubbing stone with a carved 
 head of John Peelthe famous huntsman  
 who lived and hunted over the whole   
 area.In an adjoining field belonging  
 to Orthwaite Hall is an archaeological
 site,its origin is unknown as it has  
 never been excavated.                 </content>
