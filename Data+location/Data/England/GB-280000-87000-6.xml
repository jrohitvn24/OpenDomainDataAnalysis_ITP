		<title>06DUNSFORD'S BLACKSMITH</title>
		<content> We believe that the Smallridge family 
 is the longest father to son chain of 
 blacksmiths in the country.The present
 blacksmith took over ten years ago.In 
 the forge there is a great big granite
 trough for cooling horse shoes which  
 weighs at least one ton.The building  
 is made of stone and cob and is about 
 150 years old.                        
 The blacksmith starts at 8.00.am and  
 finishes at 5.00pm. His job is shoeing
 horses and making iron tools.He has   
 nobody to help him and it must be very
 hard work.He has to trim the hooves to
 the right size,then he has to heat up 
 the shoe and shape it to fit by       
 hammering it on his anvil.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
