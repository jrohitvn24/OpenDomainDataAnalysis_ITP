		<content>{EMPLOYMENT}-On a bad winter's day     
 normally, the weather forecast is sent
 from the met' office in Birmingham,   
 then the forecast is broadcasted on   
 CB radio to the county road department
 from there, men check the roads       
 between three and four in the morning 
 and the duty of the foreman decides   
 whether to grit the roads or not. The 
 men are split into six divisions who  
 are always on standby. On the motorway
 the men work twelve hour shifts. The  
 men come on at 7.30am till 7.30pm and 
 then another group of men work from   
 7.30pm till 7.30am.Twenty six men work
 in this division.                     
{ROAD SURFACES}-The days when there    
 is snow on the roads, they put salt on
 the road to melt the snow. Although   
 the salt on the road is doing good it 
 is damaging the road surface,also     
 frost damages the surface.            </content>
