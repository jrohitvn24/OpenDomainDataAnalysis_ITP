		<content>  There is a wide range of housing in  
 our area.Many properties close to our 
 school are{semidetached houses}and    
{detached bungalows.}A few bungalows   
 are quite old and do not have garages.
{ Near March Railway Station}there is a
 detached house, built{in 1929.}It has 
 pretty eaves.{Station Road}has some   
 terraced houses,built in{1899,}and    
{there are three sets of old terraces  
{in groups of twelve in Norwood Road.  
{Most of the terraced}housing was the  
 result of the railway boom.In{County  
{Road are terraced houses in groups of 
{four,built in 1929,}and only one new  
 house,built in 1984.                  
  In {Russel Avenue,}some owners have  
 bought their{council houses.}They have
 put in UPVC windows and doors, built  
 walls, put up shutters and built      
 porches and extensions.
