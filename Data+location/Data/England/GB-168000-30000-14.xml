		<title>14Education - A School Day</title>
		<content>      I wake up at about 8 o'clock and 
 get dressed.  After breakfast I pack  
 my lunch and drink into my bag and    
 leave for school by car at about 8.30.
      At school we can play outside    
 until 9.05.  Then we come inside and  
 settle down to our work.  First of all
 we have Assembly, then do English or  
 Maths until breaktime at 10.45, when  
 we go out to play.  We then work for  
 an hour until dinner-time at 12       
 o'clock.  I have a packed lunch, but  
 some children have School Dinners.    
      Afternoon School starts at 1.30  
 and we work at a variety of things,   
 such as Art, Music, P.E., Craft,      
 Environmental Studies until 3.45 when 
 school ends.  Sometimes we work right 
 through our afternoon breaktime, which
 is 2.30 to 2.45.  We  like it when we 
 go out on visits connected with our   
 work, or have a film about it.        </content>
