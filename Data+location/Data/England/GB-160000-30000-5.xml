		<content> On leaving the area's Primary Schools 
 at the age of 11 the children         
 continue their secondary education at 
 Helston Comprehensive School. The     
 children are taken to and from Helston
 School by coach paid for by the County
 Council.                              
 For children under school age the area
 offers a Mother and Toddlers Group at 
 Herland Cross C.P. School and a       
 Playgroup and Mother and Toddlers     
 Group at Sithney C.P. School.  All    
 these Groups are run on a voluntary   
 basis with no money from other        
 sources.                              
 The area offers little opportunity for
 Adult Education as the nearest Adult  
 Education Classes are held in either  
 Helston or Camborne.
