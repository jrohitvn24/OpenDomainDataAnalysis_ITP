  Danehill (originally Denhill) means  
 'pig hill'. The pigs were brought hee 
 to feed on the acorns in the forest   
 and gradually a settlement grew up. As
 the turnpike roads came to Sussex it  
 got bigger and with the advent of     
 railways it became a dormitory town.  
{CHURCHES}                             
  2 of the 7 churches are disused. In  
 1835 the first Danehill church was    
 built which stood on the site of the  
 war memorial. The present church was  
 built in 1893 on the orders of Mr     
 Herbert Carey Hardy's wife on his     
 death from an operation on his broken 
 leg and his tomb is now behind the war
 memorial. Danehill church is probably 
 the only church in the world on the   
 Greenwich Meridian.
