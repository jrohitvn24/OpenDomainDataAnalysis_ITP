		<title>11Blue Cross Sanctuary Kimpton</title>
		<content>{History:}This organisation originated 
 80 yrs. ago, taking in ponies, donkeys
 and dogs,especially strays. During    
 the first world war it helped wounded 
 cavalry horses.                       
{Money Matters:}The Blue Cross is a    
 national charity which relies on      
 contributions from the public. People 
 give money when they acquire new pets,
 leave bequests in their wills and have
 collecting boxes and flag days.       
{Adoption Scheme:}With this scheme     
 people pay for a single kennel, Â£60 in
 cost. They do this in remembrance of a
 pet. A plaque in the pet's name is    
 placed on the wall next to the kennel.
{Kimpton Sanctuary:}Its land of 5 acres
 has 10 runs. Each run has an attached 
 kennel block, with individual cages &amp; 
 a kitchen area. There is also a field 
 for the ponies, donkeys and horses. A 
 reception area completes the home.    </content>
