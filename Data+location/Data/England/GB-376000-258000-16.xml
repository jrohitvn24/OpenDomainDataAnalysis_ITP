		<title>16THE BAKERY - WICHENFORD</title>
		<content>{Palmers' Bakery}has been in operation 
 for{70 years,}with the present Mr.    
 Palmer in control for 8 years.        
 Bread is still baked in the{original  
{brick oven,}which was recently        
 converted from brick to oil.          
 Work begins at{4.30 am}with mixing the
 dough for about{200 loaves}and Chelsea
 buns and doughnuts. New flour stock is
 ordered each fortnight.               
 During the day Mrs. Palmer sells bread
 in the shop while her husband and son 
 deliver to shops in{Worcester, Martley
 and{Broadheath                        
 The  Bakery is closed for lunch, but  
 most of the trade is finished by then 
 and they rarely have unsold loaves.   
 The business is closed on Sundays and 
 for{one week's holiday}a year.        
 It is a well known, well liked bakery 
 with regular customers coming from up 
 to 10 miles for their day's bread.    </content>
