		<title>18CHURCHDOWN LAND DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content>  There has been a large amount of Land
 Development in Churchdown in the last 
 few years,including the building of   
 several new housing estates in and    
 around the village.The first new      
 houses have appeared opposite Chosen  
 Hill School,in Brookfield Road,on a   
 piece of land which used to be an     
 orchard.The other main site is        
 situated near Churchdown Junior       
 School.                               
  The building of a Motorway(M5) in    
 1968 has also affected land use around
 it.When the Motorway was built the    
 topsoil was taken off the surrounding 
 fields and rubbish from the Motorway  
 was dumped into the fields.Because    
 of this the land is just used for     
 grazing beef cattle.The grass on the  
 other side of Motorway however,is     
 still used for dairy cattle.
