		<content>The longest mural in Europe is situated
in Nechells.It was undertaken by a     
group of Birmingham artists and the    
design reflects the life and events of 
the Nechells area.Local schools        
submitted designs to be included in the
mural.Examples of the scenes depicted  
include local heroes,The Battle of     
Birmingham,The Barracks,Birmingham     
Public Transport and pre-redevelopment 
street scenes.The mural spans the      
Rupert Street Wall of the Windsor      
Industrial Estate,measuring 301 metres 
in length.Each part of the mural is an 
inset of the wall (approx.3m x 3m).The 
Manpower Services Commission funded the
project which was completed in 1984.   
In an area known for it's vandalism and
graffiti,the mural has existed         
completely without blemish for sixteen 
months.
