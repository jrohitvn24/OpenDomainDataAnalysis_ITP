		<content> The{farming}in the Tadcaster district 
 is varied. There are seven farms      
 included in the D-block which are very
 similar in character. Some farms keep{
{live-stock}such as sheep while others 
 cultivate a lot of land for crops such
 as wheat, barley, oil-seed rape and   
 sugar beet. Some areas of farmland    
 have given way to plantations of young
{trees}to encourage the growth of woods
 and forests. Other farms look after{  
{poultry}such as turkeys which are     
 fattened, killed and plucked for      
 Christmas or Easter. The farms need a 
 lot of machinery to take care of the  
 large amount of land.
