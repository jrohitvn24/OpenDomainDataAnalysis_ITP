		<title>19Youth Club</title>
		<content> Youth club is held every Monday 7pm to
 9.30pm at the village hall.The last   
 two weeks there has been a chance for 
 fourth year leavers to go free.I went 
 both nights and I think it is very    
 good.There  is a table tennis         
 set,snooker tables and an Atari.Plus  
 music!I like playing table tennis best
 because i am good at tennis and it    
 gives me practice.The youth club is   
 open all the year but for school      
 holidays.On the last one before it    
 closes for the Summer holidays or     
 Christmas they have a special treat   
 like a barbecue or Christmas dinner.I 
 went to the barbecue and it was very  
 good.You could have hamburgers or hot 
 dogs or even a jacket potato or a pot 
 of beans.At Christmas I expect it will
 be just as good.I enjoyed it a lot and
 next year when it starts up again I   
 shall join.                           </content>
