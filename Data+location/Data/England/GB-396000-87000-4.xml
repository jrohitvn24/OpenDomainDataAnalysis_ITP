		<title>04ROUND ISLAND NEAR ARNE</title>
		<content>                                       
   Round Island lies to the East of    
 Arne,across the narrow Wych Channel.  
 The wardens live an isolated life and 
 visit the mainland only on a Thursday.
 They have their own boat and Thursday 
 is the only day on which they have a  
 paper. When the wardens are on        
 holiday ,the island is left           
 untended and is visited by the owner. 
 There is no postman and mail must be  
 collected from the GPO. There is also 
 no dustman and all rubbish is burnt.  
   Water is obtained from an artesian  
 well 180 ft deep but as it has a high 
 iron content it must be neutralized at
 the island's plant.                   
   Electricity and telephone services  
 are received from the mainland:       
 Electricity comes from near Branston  
 Farm. The only inhabitants of Round   
 Island are the wardens.               </content>
