		<title>17TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content>  A group of children undertook a      
survey of all the traffic going through
the centre of Madeley Village, along   
the A525 from Newcastle-under-Lyme to  
Whitchurch and Wrexham.                
  The survey was done in short, twenty 
minute "bursts", giving a fairly accu- 
rate picture of traffic movement.      
  During any hour observed, there were 
between 280 and 370 cars passing       
through the village, and the following 
details are typical of what we found in
one hour:-                             
     284 cars         27 lorries       
      35 small vans    6 tractors      
       7 buses        36 other vehicles
  At certain times in the year, traffic
through Madeley is greatly increased,  
as it is a main route from the Pottery 
towns out to the coast of North and Mid
Wales, and to the Snowdonia National   
Park.                                  </content>
