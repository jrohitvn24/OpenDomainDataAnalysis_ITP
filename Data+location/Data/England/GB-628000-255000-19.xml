		<title>19HOUSING IN WICKHAM MARKET</title>
		<content>The oldest housing in Wickham dates    
from the middle ages whilst the newest 
were built in the 80's. There are      
medieval stud and plaster cottages,    
Georgian and Victorian town houses and 
terraces and modern pre and post war   
estates. Many of the children live in  
the new housing at Simon Cross and     
those along Broad road. Orchard Place, 
Lime Close, Elm road beside the school 
where built in the 60's. All of these  
houses have main drainage,             
electricity, water and gas from the    
North Sea. But it is only a few years  
ago that the sewerage works was built  
in Wickham. Carolyn lives at 1 Lime    
Close and her house has got four       
bedrooms, two WC's, one bathroom, a    
playroom, a frontroom, kitchen, dining 
room and a garage. She has a front,    
back and side garden and says her house
is big.                                </content>
