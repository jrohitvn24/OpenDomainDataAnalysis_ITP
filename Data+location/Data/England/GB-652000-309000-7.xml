   Nowadays one complete round of the  
 track covers a distance of two miles, 
 enclosing 13.3 acres. It is said to   
 have the flattest mile in the country.
 The Yarmouth course can stable about  
 100 horses. In one year about 15 races
 are held durint the summer season,    
 with a minimum of 6 races in one day. 
 Previously horses were transported    
 from the Railway stations,but now     
 lorries are used for the whole        
 journey.                              
   Inside the track is part of the Gt. 
 Yarmouth and Caister Golf Course. This
 land is rented from the race-course   
 owners. Around the track there is     
 about 6 miles of fencing. Some land is
 used for Summer touring caravans.
