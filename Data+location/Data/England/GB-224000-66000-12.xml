		<title>12      Trevecca Farm.</title>
		<content>   Mr.Wills farms Trevecca farm which  
 has 143 acres and is opproximately 200
 years old. Only 100 acres of land are 
 actually farmed and rest is marsh and 
 woodland. Ten acres of barley is grown
 for winter feed and the rest is grass.
 On the farm there are 2 heifers, 1    
 steer, 280 ewes, 350 lambs and 6 rams.
 Most of the work is contracted out.On 
 the farm is a derelict cottage with no
 access, water, gas or electricity. It 
 has been empty for 20 years and had   
 been used by a farm worker. Just by   
 the cottage there is an old wall and  
 the land on the other side of it comes
 right to the top of the wall. This was
 the site of an old Quaker meeting     
 house and burial ground. Also on the  
 farm there is an old cider press made 
 mostly of wood. At the beginning of   
 the century one of the fields was the 
 refuse tip for Liskeard.              </content>
