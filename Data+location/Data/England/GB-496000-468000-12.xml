		<title>12Transport in Weaverthorpe</title>
		<content>   The{National Bus Service}runs a bus 
{service morning and evening}each      
 working day, mainly to take workers to
 Dewhirst's clothing factory at        
{Driffield.}On{2 days each week}there  
 is a bus from{Malton to Driffield     
 passing through Weaverthorpe. Since   
 many of the men and young people work 
 outside the village, most families    
{have to provide their own transport.} 
 If grown-up children still live at    
 home then there may be 2,3 or 4 cars. 
   People working in Driffield, Malton 
 and Scarborough take at least one     
 other person in their cars.           
   The nearest{frequent bus service}   
 runs along the{A64, from Malton to    
{Scarborough,}stopping at Sherburn, 4  
 miles away.                           
   The{nearest train services}are at   
{Scarborough, Malton and Driffield.}
