		<title>01SUMMARY OF AREA  BRIDGE</title>
		<content> Our Domesday Block is a rural area. It
 is typical chalk Downland with three  
 dry valleys as well as the valley of  
 the River Nailbourne. It consists     
 mainly of agricultural land rising    
 gently from the Nailbourne Valley. The
 three villages Bridge, Patrixbourne   
 and Bekesbourne are situated in the   
 Nailbourne Valley.                    
 The Nailbourne is an intermittent     
 chalk stream. At present it is flowing
 from the lake in Bourne Park which is 
 fed by springs but is dry higher up.  
 There are seven farms wholly or partly
 within the area.The traditional       
 Kentish crops of apples and hops are  
 grown.About one third of the block is 
 covered with orchards growing apples, 
 pears and plums.                      
 The landscape is very beautiful with  
 many trees and belts of woodland to   
 add interest to the local views.      </content>
