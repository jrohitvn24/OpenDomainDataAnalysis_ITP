		<title>06HITCHIN PRIORY (2)</title>
		<content> The{Radcliffe}family were to remain   
 masters of the Priory until 1963.     
 During their long reign a few of the  
 Radcliffe line carried out the        
 construction of a{mansion house}on the
 same site,most notably the Adam's Wing
 built by John Radcliffe between 1770  
 and 1777 at a cost of Â£27,000 but it  
 was left to the last Radcliffe,       
 Sir John,to restore the house to some 
 measure of its former dignity and,    
 beauty,which proved a massive task.   
 In 1919 it was reported that the      
 Priory had not a single bathroom in   
 the house,very little sanitation,no   
 electric light,no central heating and 
 large areas of dry rot.In 1965 the    
 Priory was purchased by Herts. County 
 Council and after extensive repairs it
 was opened in October 1967 as a centre
 for educational courses.It has now    
 become a home for an Insurance Co.    </content>
