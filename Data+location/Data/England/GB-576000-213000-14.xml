		<title>14TERLING HOUSING AND HOMELIFE</title>
		<content> Nearly all the houses in the village  
 belong to Lord Rayleigh, although some
 are privately owned or council houses.
 People find it hard to come in and buy
 houses in the village and building is 
 discouraged. Most of the houses in the
 centre of the village are of lathe and
 plaster and timber framed, and many   
 are over 300 years old. One or two    
 were built in the 13th or 14th Century
 e.g. Vine Cottage, Church Cottage and 
 Ringers Farm, which is being renovated
 this year for a TV celebrity from     
 "Crossroads". A huge curved beam has  
 been found here, which may have come  
 from the Bishop's Palace. There is a  
 fine Tudor House opposite the Church, 
 also a windmill, which is now a house.
 Rayleigh houses are maintained  by the
 estate yard, which employs several    
 men. Many of the villagers work on the
 estate farms, as have their ancestors.</content>
