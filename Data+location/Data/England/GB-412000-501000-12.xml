		<title>12Beacon Hill</title>
		<content> Beacon Hill is 1045ft (319m) high and 
 stands the North side of the road     
 above Richmond. On top is an ancient  
 Beacon which would have been lit to   
 warn people in Richmond Castle of     
 raiders.                              
  On a clear day you get a beautiful   
 view of the Dales countryside.        
 Sometimes it is possible to see York  
 Minster                               
  During the Spanish Armada a warning  
 signal was received from Roseberry    
 Topping, above Guisborough. The Beacon
 was then lit to pass the message on to
 Durham.                               
  It was manned again in the 19th      
 century when the Napoleonic invasion  
 was threatend.                        
  The last time it was lit was in 1981 
 when Prince Charles and Lady Diana    
 Spencer got married.
