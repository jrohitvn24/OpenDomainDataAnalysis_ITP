		<content>    At break I usualy play Blockie with
 my friends.In that you close your eyes
 and count up to a certain number in a 
 certain table.When you have done that 
 you go to look for your friends.If you
 see them you run to the Blockie post  
 (that is where you count)and say Block
 1 2 3 _____ who ever you found.If they
 get to the  post before you they say  
 Block 1 2 3 myself.                   
    Another game we play is            
 Stuck_in_the_Mud.In that you have one 
 person who is it.You have two dens    
 also.The object of the game is to get 
 from one den to another with out      
 getting caught.If you do get caught   
 you stand still and stick your arms   
 out for somebody to free you.You only 
 have 3 lives.                         
    We also play.Om_Bom_Bay,Ice Cream  
 and Soda,Lon-don and Witch Tiggie.
