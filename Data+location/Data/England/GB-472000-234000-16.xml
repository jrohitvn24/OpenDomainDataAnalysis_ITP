		<title>16FAMILY LIFE ROUND THORNTON.</title>
		<content>                                       
    In and around Thornton there are   
 about twenty_five houses, excluding   
 farm residences.                      
    In the area,{families }are very    
 isolated as there is nowhere to meet. 
 For young families, there is a Mother 
 and Toddlers group in Thornborough.   
 Shopping is a difficulty with young   
 children as the nearest shops are in  
 Buckingham, which is five miles away, 
 as are the police station and health  
 facilities. With older children the   
 parents find that they have to        
 transport them everywhere as there is 
 no{public transport}in the area.      
    Most people travel out of Thornton 
 to work. In their spare time, the     
 villagers enjoy{gardening}and{sports. 
    An annual event is Thorton College 
 Fete where the villagers meet.
