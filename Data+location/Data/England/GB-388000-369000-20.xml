 "A former sexton, Mr. Holland used to 
 say he often saw the ghost of Mary    
 Fytton.There would be a rustling of   
 silk and a low sigh and from behind   
 the altar Mary dressed in a green     
 riding habit would apppear.She would  
 glide down the chancel and then       
 disappear into the vestry. The church 
 would go very cold."                  
 "He also told of meeting the ghost of 
 Maggoty Johnson.One moonlight night he
 met a man on a white charger who      
 turned off the road into "Maggoty     
 Wood",Mr. Holland followed and arrived
 at Maggoty's grave just in time to    
 hear the stone go bump."
