<title>21Landrake Village Carnival</title>
<content>

This year 2011 was the 1st village carnival for 10 years in the village. There where many reasons why it stopped from being to expensive (mainly insurance for the floats) to people from other places ruining it in the evening to it not well attended to people not wanting to run it any more and probably lots of other reasons I don't know. But anyway after 10 years it restarted with stalls around the square and north road as well as a car boat sale in the school play ground. There was a small procession with the carnival queen in a car and a few small groups dressed up. They where mainly parent and toddler groups but there was one at the end in star wars outfits. There was a live band after this and to close the carnival, as well as a dog show and various other activitys. There was also a disco in the pub in the evening. Despite the drizzle and sometimes full on rain it was popular and should carry on for at least a few more years yet.   &lt;br />
