 I LIKE TO PLAY HIGHER AND HIGHER.YOU  
 GET A SKIPPING ROPE,ONE PERSON HOLDS  
 AN END AND ANOTHER PERSON HOLDS THE   
 OTHER END.TWO PEOPLE JUMP OVER THE    
 ROPE WHICH IS RAISED A LITTLE HIGHER  
 EACH CLEAR JUMP. IF YOU TRIP OVER THE 
 ROPE, OR YOU KNOCK IT OUT OF THE      
 HOLDERS HAND  YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE END
 INSTEAD. THE WINNER IS THE PERSON WHO 
 CAN JUMP THE HIGHEST.                 
{                                      
{LEAP-FROG             NICOLA EUSTACE  
 I LIKE PLAYING LEAP-FROG.THIS IS HOW  
 WE PLAY,SOMEBODY GETS ON THEIR HANDS  
 AND KNEES,THEN WE RUN AND JUMP OVER.  
 EACH TIME WE JUMP THE OTHER PERSON    
 GETS HIGHER AND HIGHER AND IF SOMEONE 
 CANNOT GET OVER THEY HAVE TO BE THE   
 ONE WHO GETS ON THEIR HANDS AND KNEES.
 ITS GOOD FUN.    {
