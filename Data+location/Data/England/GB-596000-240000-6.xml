		<content>The most popular service is Christmas  
time and Christmas midnight communion. 
                                       
Dr. Toon is the priest.  If someone is 
sick, Dr. Toon goes to visit them at   
their home and if there are marriages, 
burials or christenings, Dr. Toon goes 
to visit the family before the service.
275 copies of the Parish Magazine are  
printed each month.                    
                                       
There are about twenty ladies helping  
with flower arrangements.  In the      
Church Choir there are twenty-five     
children if they all turn up.  If some 
are not there, there are about fifteen 
children.  On Christmas days or        
something like that, there are all of  
the Choir there. The organ is old      
because it has a pump to push to blow  
the organ.  Mr. Potts plays the organ  
but when he is away Mr. Lowe plays it. </content>
