		<title>06Village of Sampford Spiney</title>
		<content> The village ofsampford Spiney has a   
 population of about 120 people.       
 Downfield Cottages, originally four,  
 now  reduced to three were built for  
 workers in the granite quarries, now  
 obsolete.  There is an old farmhouse, 
 Eastontown, now a private residence   
 with a much older one behind it,      
 Warne's Kitchen, now used as a store. 
 Nearby is an old farm, Gee's          
 Eastontown, of about 60 acres, mostly 
 used for store cattle. The old Manor  
 Farm is close to the church (1250     
 AD)and a modern house is nearby.      
 Holetown Farm owns land running down  
 to the River Walkham, some of it      
 woodland. The old Rectory, now called 
 Southtown, is a private residence.    
 Just below is Stoneycroft, a large    
 granite built house, built at the     
 turn of the century.
