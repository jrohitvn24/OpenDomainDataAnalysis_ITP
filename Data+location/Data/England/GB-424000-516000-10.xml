		<title>10OIL SEED RAPE</title>
		<content>   Many of the fields near Archdeacon  
 Neton in the late springtime were a   
 vivid lemony yellow colour. The farmer
 called the plants which produced these
 colours rape, and explained that they 
 were encouraged by the European       
 Economic Community because when the   
 flowers go to seed and drop off, the  
 seeds which are left can be crushed to
 produce the oil which is used to make 
 kooking oils and margarine. the plants
 Latin name is Brassica Napus which    
 makes it one of the cabbage family and
 it is doubly useful to the farmers    
 because the stems and leaves make good
 fodder for sheep and cattle in winter.
