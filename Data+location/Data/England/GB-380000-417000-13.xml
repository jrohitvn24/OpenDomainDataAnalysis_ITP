 The area is one relying mainly on     
 sheep farming.But today farming has   
 declined and the recent recent influx 
 of professional people (Solicitors,   
 Doctors) has changed the              
 infra-structure.Now many people travel
 to the nearby towns and cities (Bury, 
 Manchester.)                          
     An old mill has been converted for
 private enterprises including         
 T.V.rentals, rehearsals studios gear  
 box repair and an onyx works, which   
 imports the raw material from Pakistan
 and Mexico.                           
     Quarries exist in the area, now   
 re-opened and providing employment.   
 Contractors are busy rebuilding the   
 road linking the quarry to the main   
 road. Volunteer groups are used to    
 maintain the walks, dry stone walls   
 and countryside.                      </content>
