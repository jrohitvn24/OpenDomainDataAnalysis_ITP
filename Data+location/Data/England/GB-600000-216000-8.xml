		<title>08MOOR FARM, LANGENHOE</title>
		<content> Most farms in the area are large in   
 size, but there are also some smaller 
 ones, of which{Moor farm}is an        
 example .My Grandad owns{Moor}farm-it 
 has been in the family for 63 years.  
 They sell eggs and some vegtables. And
 they grow flowers for seed. Wheat is  
 grown on the rest of the land. The    
 lowest land next to the sea wall is   
 drained and only rough grass grows.   
 There is some more low lying marshy   
 land further along the road where the 
 creek finally runs out. Horses        
 sometimes graze there.
