		<content>  The main means of transport          
 is by car. The bus service is very    
 limited and there are only 7 services 
 a week along the Shrewsbury to        
 Ironbridge road. The bus service to   
 from Eaton Constantine to Telford runs
 only twice each week. Because there is
 so little public transport for the    
 people of the area the villagers have 
 started a{VOLUNTARY CAR SCHEME.}This  
 means that if someone who does not    
 have a car needs to go to one of the  
 nearby towns for medical treatment or 
 some emergency there is a rota of car 
 owners who will take them.            
  The nearest railway stations are in  
 Telford and Shrewsbury.               
  The nearest airport is in Birmingham 
 which is about 40 miles away.
