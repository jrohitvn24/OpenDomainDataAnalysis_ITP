		<title>20Two People From Great Chart</title>
		<content> Mrs.Swaffer is a Parish Councillor and
 Chairman of the Governors of our      
 school.Mr.Swaffer is Chairman of the  
 Cricket Club.We asked them lots of    
 questions about how much the village  
 has changed.There used to be four     
 shops,one used to be the forge,one    
 used to be where Chart Glass is,one is
 where the hairdresser is and one where
 the allotments are.Twenty years ago a 
 new Methodist Church was built because
 the old one had no running water and  
 no electricity and it was too small.  
 An artist bought the old one for a    
 studio and has now sold it.They are   
 now making it into a house,down Chapel
 Lane.A new BMX track is being planned 
 but it could be a hazard because there
 will be a lot of cars about.In 50     
 years time it could become part of    
 Ashford or may stay as a village.
