		<title>04An Elderly People's Home</title>
		<content> We visited Carybrook, an elderly      
 people's home in Castle Cary, with a  
 question sheet &amp; tape-recorder. We    
 interviewed three people about        
 themselves:-                          
  One man used to work in a joinery    
 shop on Bailey Hill, but came to      
 Carybrook because he became too old to
 look after himself. He said he enjoyed
 the scenery and wouldn't move for any 
 reason.                               
  One woman had lived in Cary all her  
 life, and said she liked all the area,
 and wouldn't leave. She told us there 
 was once a cheese factory in Cary, and
 enjoyed talking about the town.       
  Another woman had been in the home   
 for 4 years, and had come for family  
 reasons. She liked the area, but      
 didn't know it very well, as she      
 couldn't get about much.
