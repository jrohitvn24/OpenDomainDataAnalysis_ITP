		<content>There are many different roads in the D
block. Some are big, wide and busy like
the B4009 which runs from Goring to    
Wallingford in one direction and to    
Readng in the other. It passes our     
 chool and on the 1Oth of June we found
1344 vehicles went by between 8:30am   
and 2:30pm. Some roads are             
small,narrow and quiet like Elvendon   
Rd.to Woodcote or the road to Ipsden.  
One of the most dangerous spots is     
where the High St.meets the B4009      
over the railway bridge. In the High   
Street the corner by the Post Office   
is dangerous because it is narrow and  
people park on the double yellow lines.
Goring has lots of cul de sacs and they
are very quiet and good for children   
playing.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
