		<content>  {TOURISTS }We get many tourists in   
 Lyndhurst especially in the summer.   
{The shops keep going during the winter
{with the money they get from the      
{summer.}There are seasonal influxes of
 tourists, at Christmas, Easter, and   
 the summer.{People come to Lyndhurst  
{from all over the world, they come    
{individually and they come in tour    
{parties.}They come from all over the  
 country to camp in the forest.{On Bank
{Holidays the roads become blocked with
{cars and caravans, at weekends in the 
{seasons the traffic becomes very      
{heavy.}To the traders the tourists are
 their comfort for the long winter     
 months.{Local people benefit from the 
{tourist trade but some complain that  
{shop prices are high.}It is exciting  
 to see and meet people from different 
 countries.{Alex Hobson, age 8.
