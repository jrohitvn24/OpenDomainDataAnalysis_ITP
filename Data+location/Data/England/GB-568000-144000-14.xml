		<title>14DECLINE OF HOP GROWING.</title>
		<content>15 acres of Bockingfold Farm is used   
for growing hops.A couple of years ago 
it was a very profitable business to be
in but this has now changed.We were    
informed that the cost of wire for just
1 hop garden costs as much as 2,500    
pounds.Nowadays hops can be stored for 
up to 4 years in pellet form.Kent has  
stock to last until 1988 and so farmers
are looking for more profitable crops  
like rape seed. New types of hops have 
more flavour than some of the older    
varieties and therefore fewer are      
needed.The enormous cost of production 
means that many of the smaller farms   
can no longer afford to grow hops.     
Tastes in beer drinking are changing   
and many people now prefer the less    
bitter tasting beers which contain     
fewer hops.
