		<title>13Dargate Motor Museum</title>
		<content> Dargate Historic Transport Collection 
 is a private collection of veteran and
 vintage cars,lorries and motor bikes  
 housed at Chapel Plantation, Dargate. 
 The vehicles have been collected over 
 the past 28 years and provide a       
 fascinating glimpse of the past.      
 The oldest cars are a 1903 CLEMENT and
 a 1903 RAMBLER both of which have been
 on the London to Brighton Run.        
 In the museum building exhibits are   
 arranged against a mural of an        
 oldfashioned street together with many
 accessories.  Outside stand old carts,
 ploughs and wagons in an orchard      
 setting.                              
 There has been some controversy       
 locally over planning permission for  
 the building but this has now been    
 regularised and application made for  
 permission to open the museum to the  
 public.                               </content>
