		<content>      Each Wednesday the{Book Bus}comes
 and the big kids pick-on the little   
 ones. Because you don't have to pay to
 borrow the books some people keep the 
 books and ask to join again. Once     
 someone tried to set the book bus on  
 fire. On the park the big kids tip the
 swings over the bar so you can't get  
 on them.                              
     {Dogs}are always in the dustbins  
 round where we live. Each morning the 
 bin is tipped up and there is a mess. 
      At the top of our garden over the
 fence there is another house and the  
 kids there are always throwing{rubbish
 over our yard. Each Wednesday the     
{Dustbin Men}come and they always leave
 the back gate open and the{dog}gets   
 out. Last week we never found him for 
 an hour and then he was on Meadow     
 Gardens chasing the kids on the       
 roundabout.                           </content>
