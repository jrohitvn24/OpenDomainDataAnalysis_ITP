		<title>15NATURE CONSERVANCY COUNCIL</title>
		<content> The{NATURE CONSERVANCY COUNCIL}_formed
 1949 by Royal Charter, took over the  
 management of a large part of {       
{Wychwood Forest,}approximately 262 ha 
 in {1955,}when the area was designated
 a{site of special scientific interest.
  This was due to the abundance of rare
 flora and fauna and the antiquity of  
 the forest. By restricting access to  
 persons declaring an interest in, and 
 respect for the conservation of all   
 aspects of the forest,it has been     
 possible to preserve much of the      
 natural beauty of the area. Guided    
 parties of not more than {20 persons} 
 are shown around the area maintained  
 by the {N.C.C.,}by voluntary wardens  
 who live in the locality.
