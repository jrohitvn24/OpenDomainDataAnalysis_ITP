		<title>11National Garden Festival</title>
		<content>Very few people would have thought that
 Anyone would have spent an enjoyable  
day on the derelict land left after the
Shelton Steelworks closure which left  
2,000 men from the steelworks          
unemployed.                            
The total cost of the reclamation work 
on the old Shelton Steelworks was over 
7.5 million pounds.                    
1.5 million cubic metres of earth and  
rubble was removed from the site along 
with 145.0 square metres of slurry.    
The garden festival which opens on May 
1st to October 26th 1986 intends to    
have a two and a half mile railway,an  
80 berth marina,a specially designed   
palm  house with exotic plants and an  
exhibition in Eturia Hall by Wedgwood  
and Doulton.
