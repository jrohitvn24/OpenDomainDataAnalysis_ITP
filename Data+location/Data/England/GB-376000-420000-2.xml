		<title>02LIVING IN HELMSHORE.</title>
		<content>  Life in Helmshore is very pleasant.  
 It is fairly quiet, with only one     
 motorway;the M66. Helmshore area holds
 about 6 schools. Most of the schools  
 are primary schools. It also contains 
 several firms on Holcombe Road.       
                                       
 There are two main attractions in     
 Helmshore;Higher Mill and the Tor.    
 Higher Mill used to be a woollen      
 mill, but now it is a museum. The     
 granite Tor dominates the landscape.  
 It resembles an upside-down pudding   
 basin.                                
                                       
 Many new housing estates have been    
 built in recent years. The motorway   
 link has made it possible for         
 Helmshore people to work in nearby    
 cities.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
