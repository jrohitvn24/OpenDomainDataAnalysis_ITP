		<content> As we look back sixty years we realise
 that life is not so hard today as in  
 the 1920s and 30s. While the children 
 and men were at school or work, women 
 spent their time doing housework and  
 making meals. Women didn't go to work 
 because if they were married they were
 expected to look after the house.     
 Today much of the hard work is done by
 electricity.
