		<content> Approximately 11% of the working age  
 population is unemployed. The national
 average is 13%. There are industrial  
 estates for small time employers but  
 no large industries. Small factories  
 have employees making furniture,      
 clocks and specialised road vehicle   
 trailers. A small maltings prepares   
 grain for the brewing industry. There 
 are many small businesses employing   
 one or two people and many self       
 employed people offering their        
 services doing house repairs and      
 gardening. National and local         
 government have offices employing a   
 few people. One office is concerned   
 with registering people seeking       
 employment and listing job vacancies. 
 Many employees are members of a       
 relevant trade union and meet to      
 negotiate pay awards and working      
 conditions.                           </content>
