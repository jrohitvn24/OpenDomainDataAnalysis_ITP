		<content> Mrs Andrews lives in Croxdale. She's  
 lived in the area nearly all her life.
 She was born there in 1900, in a house
 opposite the old colliery. From her   
 window she could see the red brick    
 chimney with the date 1875 in white   
 bricks, the date the pit was sunk. Her
 father worked there and he once took  
 her down with him. She said it was    
 aweful. She saw the poor pit ponies   
 which pulled the trucks of coal. The  
 miners used to take a canary down with
 them to test for gas.                 
   She liked walking. She would gather 
 flowers and knew all their names. She 
 played games with her friends in the  
 road outside her home, games like     
 chucks, hop-scotch, bowling a hoop and
 tops and whips. It was safe then to   
 play in the roads because there were  
 no cars or buses.
