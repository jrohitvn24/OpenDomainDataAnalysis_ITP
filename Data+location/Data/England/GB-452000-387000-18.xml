		<title>18The Farm Museum-Laughton, 2</title>
		<content> cost.                                 
   When the Farm Museum started in     
 1981, the buildings were in a terrible
 state and the farmhouse was dangerous 
 because it was collapsing. Mr. Barrett
 set the naughty boys to work          
 rebuilding, which they did.           
   The site isn't just going to be a   
 farm museum, it is also going to be   
 about life between 1850 and 1950. Mr. 
 Barrett said that farmers throw very  
 little machinery away, so all he had  
 to do was ask around and collect      
 things. He said that the museum now   
 had lots of machinery which had been  
 restored to its original condition.   
 Mr. Barrett said that they had more   
 than a thousand small tools. Also in  
 the museum there is a blacksmith's    
 shop complete with hearth and bellows 
 along with lots of other craftmen's   
 tools for people to see.              </content>
