		<title>17THE RAF IN HARPUR HILL</title>
		<content>{                                      
 The RAF base established here during  
 World War 2 had left many marks on the
 area. The RAF made tunnels in the     
 limestone to store bombs &amp; ammunition.
 There are stories that they even      
 stored them in the fields but the     
 Germans did not find out and did not  
 bomb the area even though it was an   
 important target. Later the tunnels   
 were used to grow mushrooms and now   
 they are used as a cold store.        
                                       
 The buildings of the base are now used
 by High Peak College and the houses   
 which were built for the men are used 
 now by some college personel and some 
 are privately owned. Some of the roads
 are named after famous members of the 
 RAF, such as{Trenchard Drive}and      
{Harris Road.}
