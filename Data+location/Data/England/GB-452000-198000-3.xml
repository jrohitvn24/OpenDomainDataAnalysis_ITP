		<content>Population 176, in 80 households, N.C. 
sits astride the A423 trunk road. It is
a dormitory village with little work   
and minimal social activity. A Civil   
Parish only, the Eccl. Parish was amal-
gamated with the Baldons in 1970. The  
Church is used as a store.             
In 1760 Lord Harcourt moved his Estate 
cottages to their present site by the  
road, from their positions in the      
grounds of Nuneham House. They are now 
listed buildings.                      
N.C. has a garage, (fuel, car sales and
service,) an Inn, (Harcourt Arms,) a   
Cobblers, a P.O. with Gen. Stores, an  
embroidery shop, a blacksmith, (on the 
site of the old School,) a Garden      
Centre with Tea Room, and a scrap metal
yard.                                  
A wooden Village Hall is used by a few 
local organisations,(e.g. W.I.)        
Nuneham House is a Conference Centre.  </content>
