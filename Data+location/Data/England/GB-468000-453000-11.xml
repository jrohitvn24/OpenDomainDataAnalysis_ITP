 In our village we have entertainment  
 by our local Drama Groups.They put on 
 plays and musical evenings.There is an
 adult group and a young folks group of
 drama players.There is also a company 
 from York Theatre Royal who bring     
 their productions to our village hall 
 for fund raising.There are school     
 dances at the sport centre and discos 
 for the teenagers and children.Every  
 year at christmas we have a school    
 dance.There are concerts by the school
 choir and orchestra.There is also a   
 school opera.This year it was called  
 'Smike'.We have pop groups in the     
 village.One of them is called Glass   
 and Rachel Triffitt's cousin plays the
 guitar in the group.
