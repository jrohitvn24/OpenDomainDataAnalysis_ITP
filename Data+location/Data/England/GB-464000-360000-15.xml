		<content> Formal local historical publications  
 hardly exist for the Eakring and      
 Bilsthorpe area. A paper with         
 particular reference to Bilsthorpe was
 included in the Transactions of the   
 Thoroton Society for 1958. Recent     
 mining history from Bilsthorpe has    
 been included in Wallers's "The       
 Dukeries Transformed". The            
 development of Eakring's oilfield     
 appeared in "The Secret of Sherwood   
 Forest" by Woodward. Currently Eakring
 research is advanced and should lead  
 to publication, but the mediaeval     
 period requires further investigation.
 A photographic collection relevant to 
 Eakring's history is in formation and 
 family history records for the village
 are being compiled. An Eakring site   
 connected with the celebrated 17th    
 century Rector William Mompesson has  
 been renovated and signposted.        </content>
