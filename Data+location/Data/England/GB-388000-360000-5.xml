		<title>05The Bridestones</title>
		<content> The Bridestones is around 4000 years  
 old and it was probably used to bury a
 chief or another important person.He  
 would have been cremated and buried in
 an urn.There was a notice near the    
 Bridestones protecting them, this is  
 what it said 'This ancient burial     
 chamber is protected as a monument of 
 national importance under the ancient 
 monument act 1913-1953 the ministry of
 works'.The weather will have worn the 
 stones away so they won't look the    
 same as they were origanally also any 
 possible markings will have worn      
 away.The stone was gritstone and the  
 people who erected them were from the 
 West.The tomb was used to bury more   
 than one person about 10-50 people    
 actually.The tomb measures 16 feet    
 long by 5 feet wide.
