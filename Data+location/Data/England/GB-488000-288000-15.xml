		<title>15The Pole Fair, Corby.</title>
		<content>The Pole Fair was held in 1985 to      
celebrate the 400th. anniversary of the
granting of a Royal Charter to Corbei  
by Queen Elizabeth 1st.                
Corbei, as it was originally known, is 
derived from the Danish for Raven- a   
large black bird and the town's coat of
arms bear this symbol.                 
The Pole Fair is normally held only    
every twenty years so this year's event
was a special one. The old village is  
the place where it is held and is      
closed off for the day. Activites      
associated with a medieaval fair are   
held, culminating in the roasting of an
oxen in the evening. A tug of war is   
held over the brook and stocks and a   
whipping post are used for people who  
do not pay fines to charities. The     
charter is read at the town boundaries 
and there is a greasy pole with a goose
on top which people try to climb.      </content>
