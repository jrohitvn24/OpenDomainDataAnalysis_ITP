		<content>   This area has a large number of     
footpaths which are clearly marked on  
the maps &amp; on signposts put up by the  
local council. Unfortunately,they have 
a habit of disappearing,usually into a 
field of growing rape or corn.         
A greater threat to the countryside are
the disappearing hedgerows. Large      
fields may be more efficient to farm,  
but the practise of tearing down hedges
not only changes the look of the       
countryside but presents a threat to   
the wildlife of the county. Hedgerows  
provide a habitat for many different   
kinds of mammals &amp; insects.When the    
hedgerows disappear the wildlife may   
disappear with them. One of the most   
attractive features of this area is the
rolling countryside with its small     
fields and colourful hedgerows. We hope
it will not be lost for future         
generations to enjoy.                  </content>
