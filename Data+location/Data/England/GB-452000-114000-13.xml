		<title>13OLD TRANSPORT ROUTES</title>
		<content> The study area is traversed by two old
 transport routes, now disused.        
 A dismantled railway runs from        
 Botley, S.W. of the area, to Bishop's 
 Waltham just N.W. of the area. The    
 line has been the subject of study by 
 the Botley Historical Society and owes
 its origin to the strawberry industry 
 in the area. It has been nicknamed    
 the "Strawberry Line" and trainloads  
 used to carry the fruit up to London  
 for sale at Covent Garden. At the time
 of this study, the course of the      
 railway was still clearly visible and 
 in fact provided a very attractive    
 walk. It has scope for public use as a
 footpath.                             
 The Roman Road marked on the map      
 linked Portchester and Winchester.    
 Virtually nothing is visible on the   
 landscape today except for a few field
 boundaries.                           </content>
