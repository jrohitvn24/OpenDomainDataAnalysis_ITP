		<content>{West Kingsdown}straddles the A20 just 
 south of Brands Hatch. It consists of 
{low density two-storey houses and     
{bungalows.} Mainly built{post-war}the 
 initial development was clearly in the
 inter-war years and is of a{"ribbon   
{development"}nature along the A20.    
                                       
 There is little of attraction in the  
 village and a general lack of civic   
 and social amenities.  It is a typical
{"dormitory town"}with little local    
 employment, though a couple of{small  
{industrial estates}have been built in 
 the past couple of years but the      
 take-up in occupancy is no more than  
 50%.                                  
                                       
 Two buildings from an earlier era are 
 evident in the village, the{Anglican  
{church}and the{windmill,}complete with
 sails.                                </content>
