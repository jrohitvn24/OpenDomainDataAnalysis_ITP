		<title>15Trimley Traditional Beliefs</title>
		<content>  Trimley has got two parish churches  
next door to each other in the         
churchyard.  People say that they were 
built by two sisters who fell out and  
refused to go to the same church so    
each one built her own. No one seems to
know why there are two churches        
together but the Rector thinks they    
were built on the highest land in the  
villages.  A local historian says the  
"sisters" may have been religious      
houses,perhaps a monastery and a       
nunnery,each needing its own  chapel.  
  Another local belief is that there   
was once a tunnel between Alston Hall  
and Grimston Hall. The Land Agent told 
us that a line can be seen from the    
air,where the tunnel had fallen in. We 
found no trace of this. Tunnel stories 
are often connected with smuggling and 
both houses are well placed near the   
river where smuggling went on.         </content>
