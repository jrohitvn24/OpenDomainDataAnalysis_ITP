		<title>16TRANSPORT IN AYLESBURY</title>
		<content>  We did a {traffic} count to find the 
busiest road in Aylesbury. We took the 
6 main roads and counted how much      
traffic past in one hour. The Bicester 
Road, to our suprise, came first with  
more vehicles than any other road. This
is probably because many were going to 
the new Tescos. Also, there were more  
lorries. Wendover Road had the next    
most number of vehicles because most   
were going to London. The Tring Road,  
which also heads towards London, came  
next with 1,410 vehicles. The Oxford   
Road was the next in line with 1,047   
altogether. The Buckingham Road was the
road with the least traffic. The       
{railway station} has a direct route to
London's Marylebone. 20 trains stop at 
the station daily. There are 8 {bus    
companies} that run in Aylesbury. Most 
are singly operated and they also have 
3 female drivers.                      </content>
