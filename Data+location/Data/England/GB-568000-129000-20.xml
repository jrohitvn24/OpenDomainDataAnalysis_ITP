		<title>20Playing Musical Instruments</title>
		<content>  Many children learn to play a musical
 instrument at school. Only four in the
 top two classes learn an instrument   
{(piano)}at home. As well as{pitched   
{percussion}in music lessons some learn
{violin}from a visiting teacher during 
 school time and children in the three 
 junior classes are able to join lunch 
 time clubs to learn the{recorder}and  
{guitar.}Although some stop playing, a 
 lot continue and half the children in 
 our class were still playing at the   
 end of the year when most of them will
 be leaving for secondary school. Most 
 of the players are girls.             
  Most learn the recorder and once a   
 year the older players join in a      
 recorder festival with other local    
 schools when we spend a morning play- 
 ing with and to each other. We play   
 both early music and modern arrange-  
 ments on tenor, treble and descant.   </content>
