5 Children from our class went to      
visit Knole House to gather            
information. Knole House is a very     
old building in Sevenoaks. It was      
built hundreds of years ago in 1456.   
It was bought from Baron Say and       
Sele by Archbishop Bourchier for 266   
pounds, 13 shillings and 4 pence in    
old money. We found out that they have 
1000 acres of land and  between 300    
and 400 deer. Everytime a tree falls   
down they plant a new one. They        
haven't had any burglaries, their      
most treasured possessions are King    
Charles' bed, his silver and his       
furniture. Eighty eight and a half     
thousand tourists visit the house per  
year and they have 25 cottages for all 
the old workers. We enjoyed our visit  
very much.
