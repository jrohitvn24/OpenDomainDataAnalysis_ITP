 A main east-west B class road links   
 Chitterne to the market town of       
 Warminster eight miles to the west,   
 and to Shrewton, a larger village to  
 the east.  An unclassified road joins 
 villages from north to south.         
 Electricity  and telephone lines are  
 mounted on pylons and posts along the 
 valley from Codford.  Main water was  
 brought to Chitterne only in 1969 and 
 a few dwellings remain on private     
 supplies from good wells.  There is no
 mains drainage.  The County Council   
 provides a mobile library fortnightly,
 rubbish collection weekly; verges are 
 cut twice in summer and roads are     
 salted and gritted in freezing        
 weather.  There is no street lighting 
 either in the village of Chitterne or 
 in the connecting roads.
