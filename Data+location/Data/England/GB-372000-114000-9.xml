		<title>09BLACKMORE VALE DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content> The large dairy farm due west of this 
 area covers the excellent grazing land
 with a large herd of Friesians and its
 followers.The arable fields have good 
 crops of wheat and barley and 2 or 3  
 cuts of silage grass.Some hay is made 
 for winter fodder.                    
 In the south a former old mill has    
 been converted to a modern house with 
 a fertile cultivated garden alongside 
 the Bibbern Brook.Ten acres of rough  
 grazing support 20 young beef cattle. 
 Birds and insects,particularly dragon-
 flies are plentiful by the brook.Few  
 big trees are noted here but rabbits  
 foxes,stoats and a few pheasants are  
 observed.                             
 The only amenity in this area is a    
 hard surfaced road but no bus service.
 There are only 4 isolated houses.The  
 occupants work on the land or are     
 retired.There are no children.        </content>
