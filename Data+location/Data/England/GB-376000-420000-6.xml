		<title>06SCHOOLS IN HELMSHORE.</title>
		<content> In Helmshore district there are no    
 middle schools. There are two         
 secondary schools, four primary       
 schools, and one infant school.       
                                       
 Many new schools have been built in   
 recent years. This is due to the fact 
 that many new housing  estates have   
 developed. Some of the existing       
 schools have had to build extensions  
 to cope with increasing numbers of    
 pupils.                               
                                       
{Helmshore County Primary School}was   
 built in 1908. An extension was built 
 in 1973, which is used by the Infant  
 department. This is now one of the    
 largest schools in the district.
