		<content> A long time ago there was a pig yard  
 in Dunston ,but since then it has been
 changed. It was called the pig yard   
 but now it is Halls Court because it  
 has been built on and the people who  
 live there do not really want to live 
 in the pig yard. Also there are some  
 new houses built on the green they    
 have been there for five years.       
 The green has been changed into a very
 good playing area for children.Many   
 old ladies come to feed the ducks     
 which live on the green.              
     Along Chapel Lane two houses have 
 been knocked down and two more houses 
 are being built.                      
               Most people think that  
 the village should stay as it is.Some 
 people say that the village is too    
 modern and that if people are going to
 build they ought to use stone.
