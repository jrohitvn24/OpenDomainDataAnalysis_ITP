		<content>   The area is one of rolling chalk    
 downlands, an attractive typical      
 Southern English landscape with       
 cottages and farms dotted about, and  
 winding lanes crossing the downs.     
 Hedges have been uprooted to make     
 larger fields for cereal growing,but a
 number of copses have been kept,      
 especially in the north of the area.  
 The disused railway, Winchester Hill  
 Lane and Westbury Park are favourite  
 areas for walking, and wildlife       
 abounds, especially in the latter,    
 where it is common to see deer, foxes,
 badgers and rabbits. Wild flowers     
 flourish in the uncultivated areas,   
 including cowslips and wild orchids.  
 Unfortunately, the busy A32 road      
 bisects West Meon. A traffic survey in
 July 1985 showed 63 cars, 26 lorries, 
 8 vans and 2 motorbikes passing in the
 space of 30 mins.                     </content>
