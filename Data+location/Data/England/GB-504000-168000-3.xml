		<title>03HOUSING ESTATES IN LALEHAM</title>
		<content>  All round Buckland school the houses 
 are all in estates.Lots of the houses 
 all look the same because they were   
 built at the same time.               
  We have tried to find out something  
 about them.Nearest the school is a big
 council estate.It is about 30 years   
 old.All the roads are called after the
 Royal Family like Edinburgh Drive and 
 Elizabeth Avenue.In the grounds of the
 secondary school that is near us there
 is a Roman camp buried under its      
 football pitch.                       
  The Pavilion Gardens estate was      
 called after the beautiful gardens and
 tennis pavilion which went with the   
 houses.In an old paper it said they   
 cost Â£695 each.Another estate was     
 built in 1960 on a nurery that used to
 grow tomatoes and flowers,so they     
 called it Nursery Gardens.
