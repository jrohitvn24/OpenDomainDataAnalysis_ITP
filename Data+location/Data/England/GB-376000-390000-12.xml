		<content> Transport is very popular in the Sale 
 area, especially cars and buses. We   
 went round our school to see how many 
 people had bikes; the total was about 
 97%. We also asked about cars; the    
 total was about 93%. We asked about   
 motorbikes; the toatl was about 6%.   
 The next question was about what sort 
 of transport they use to come to      
 school: 39% walked, 60% came by car,  
 1% by bike. Then we asked the teachers
 -none walk, eight use cars, two by    
 byke. Then we did a survey of our     
 class on types of car. Five people had
 Cavaliers, four had Sierras, two had  
 Chevettes, and two had Carltons. Most 
 people, when travelling by bus are    
 going shopping or to work.
