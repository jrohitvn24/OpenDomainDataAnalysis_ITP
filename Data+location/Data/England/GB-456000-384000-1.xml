		<content> The block we are surveying is on the  
 boarders of{Yorkshire}and{            
{Nottinghamshire.}The land in our area 
 is{rural}not{urban.}The main features 
 of our block are farmland and         
 woodland. It is flat and moist. The   
 land is very green with many trees.   
 Our block is{agricultural}with lots of
 farms dotted about the place. There   
 is only one hill.It is not natural,it 
 is just a reclaimed mound which used  
 to be a pit tip until it was grassed  
 over.Mr Farnsworth,a local farmer     
 planted trees on the mound to         
 encourage wildlife.It is now used for 
 grazing.He is hoping to grow crops on 
 the mound. There are 3 villages       
 Carlton in{Lindrick,Letwell}and       
 Wallingwells. There is some industry  
 in{Carlton}Parts of the land is wild  
 and others cultivated.It is a pleasant
 place to live,very peaceful.          </content>
