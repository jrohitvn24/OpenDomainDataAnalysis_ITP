		<title>11Lost Facilities, Bridgham</title>
		<content> Norfolk County Council's policy is to 
 concentrate development within certain
 designated "growth" villages.  East   
 Harling (2 miles to our east) is such 
 a village;  Bridgham is too small to  
 warrant such status, nor would most   
 people want it.  However, some concern
 has been expressed throughout the     
 county in recent years, over the      
 future of small villages such as ours,
 especially in view of the constant    
 erosion of village facilities.  During
 the last  20 years, this village has  
 lost almost all its self sufficiency: 
 in the early l960's, the pub closed;  
 in the late l970's both Post Office   
 and Primary School closed;  in l984,  
 the small shop was also lost.  We     
 still have our own milk delivery      
 service and phone box.  Fortnightly   
 church services are still held, but   
 for how much longer?                  </content>
