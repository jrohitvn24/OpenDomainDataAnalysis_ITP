		<content>   Television is the main form of      
 entertainment and relaxation.  Few    
 people belong to clubs or attend      
 evening classes. Leicester is the main
 focus for entertainment for adults    
 apart from local pubs and restaurants.
 Melton Mowbray and Oakham provide     
 discos and sports facilities. Some    
 people make use  of a mobile library  
 which calls fortnightly. Most families
 read the local newspapers i.e.        
 Leicester Mercury and Melton Times and
 many families also take a daily paper 
 e.g. Mail, Express, Telegraph.        
   Organisations in the area include   
 a flourishing Young Farmers group at  
 Tilton, branches of the Womens        
 Institute at Twyford, Tilton and      
 Burrough. Church of England services  
 are held at Lowesby and Twyford parish
 churches and Methodist services at    
 Twyford Chapel.                       </content>
