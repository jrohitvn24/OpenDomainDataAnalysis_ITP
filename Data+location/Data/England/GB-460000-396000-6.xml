		<title>06ROSSINGTON MINER'S MEMORIES</title>
		<content>    When the Rossington Pit opened many
 experienced miners were needed.  They 
 came from other established mining    
 areas such as the South Wales, North  
 Wales, Nottinghamshire, Durham and    
 Scottish Coalfields.                  
     Mr E.S. Jones now aged 85 was one 
 of these men.  He worked at Rossington
 Colliery for 43 years. He was born    
 in Wrexham, N.E.Wales.  He left school
 at  14 and got a job at the local pit 
 earning 1s-6d (7\p) a day. He started 
 work on the coal face when he was 16  
 years old and can remember filling his
 tub with "large lumps and no dirt". He
 also had a pit pony to look after.    
     Mr Jones came to Rossington in    
 1922 because he could earn 2 shillings
 a shift more.  In his 43 years at     
 Rossington he saw the development of  
 the pit from pure manual labour to    
 its present day high mechanisation.   </content>
