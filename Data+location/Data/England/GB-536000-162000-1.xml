		<content>  Our area is situated just South-East 
 of Croydon. It is a nice area to live 
 in as there is alot of open park and  
 grassland.                            
 All these Buses pass through the area:
 130,130b,64,234,12a and Tillingbourne.
 Housing:- The accomodation in the area
 is mainly residential with several    
 large estates.                        
 1)New Addington:- Mainly council owned
 building began in the 1930's and      
 continued until the 1960's.           
 2) Forestdale:- Private residential   
 housing built during the 1960's-70's. 
 3) Addington Village:- Wholly         
 residential, modern housing built     
 during the 1950's and 60's.           
 Industry:- There is very little       
 industry in the area, although there  
 are two small factory estates. One in 
 New Addington, the other in Coney     
 Hall.                                 </content>
