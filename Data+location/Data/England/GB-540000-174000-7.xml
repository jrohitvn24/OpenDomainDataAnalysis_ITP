		<content>We interviewed six people who had      
lived in Eltham for an average of 42   
years .They had all left school at 14  
and had to take any available job.     
During the war Eltham had been bombed  
a lot but people were friendly and     
helped one another.You could even go   
out and leave your front door open.    
The main changes they had seen were the
coming of so many cars and a lack of   
care for the environment.They all used 
public transport but said it was       
infrequent and unreliable.They thought 
that most young people were alright but
the general impression was created by a
bad minority.
