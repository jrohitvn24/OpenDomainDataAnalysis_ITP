		<content> We play many different games at       
 school. Some consisting of two        
 teams playing against each other where
 a ball is used and sometimes a bat.   
 These are cricket and football which  
 boys usually play, Netball, a girls   
 game, and Rounders which interests    
 both boys and girls. The game "touch" 
 is a popular playtime game. It has    
 many variations such as chaintouch,   
 shadowtouch and balltouch. The idea   
 is one child tries to catch other     
 children in turn either by touching   
 them and making them join up or by    
 standing on their shadow or hitting   
 them with a ball. Younger children    
 play many imaginary games as well as  
 marbles, hopscotch and hiding games   
 where people or things are hidden     
 which have to be found. girls eajoy   
 playing handstands, skiping and many  
 ball games involving singing rhymes.  </content>
