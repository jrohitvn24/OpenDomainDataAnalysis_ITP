		<content>    In the estuary there is a rich form
 of soil type,full of living           
 organisms.Here we find some rare      
 plants e.g.the childing pink.         
    There is an area of marshland and  
 intertidal mudflats which is totally  
 covered with sea water at high tide.It
 is rich in salt marsh plants and there
 is a small wood and 16 acres of reed  
 beds.                                 
    The Bird Sanctuary was established 
 in 1964 in order to protect the little
 tern.The hedgerow bushes and shingle  
 bank are there for the rare birds to  
 nest in.                              
    Other visitors include the red     
 shank,ringed plover and oyster        
 catcher,the common tern,shell         
 duck,brent geese and occasionally we  
 see the avocet.No large scale fishing 
 is allowed here in order to ensure    
 that the birds have plenty to eat.    </content>
