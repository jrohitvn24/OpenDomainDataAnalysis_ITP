		<content> Mrs.M.Kelly has been the headmistress 
 13 years since 1972 when the school   
 opened. The builders started designing
 the school in 1970 and by 1971 work   
 started. The{Infant school}was        
 originally built because the{Junior   
{school}was too small and so plans were
 drawn up for an infant school. The    
 school opened in 1972 and 60 nursery  
 and 140 infant children were taught.  
 In 1985 there are 54 nursery and 137  
 infants. Children start nursery in the
 term just before they are 4.The school
 has six classrooms. There are 25 staff
 including the head, 6 teachers, a     
 nursery assistant, 2 clerical/non-    
 teaching assistants, dinner ladies,   
 caretaker and cleaners. The school    
 starts at 9.00 and finishes at 3.15.  
 Parents are involved with helping the 
 children in the classroom and also    
 when the classes go on outings.       </content>
