		<content> In our block there is now just one    
 primary school, but there used to be  
 two others.We are in Lancashire, but  
 close to the Cumbrian border.This area
 of Lancashire has not been reorganised
 along comprehensive lines, and        
 children still take an 11+ exam.If you
 pass, you can go to the Lancaster     
 Royal Grammar School .If not you go to
 the Lunesdale Secondary Modern School.
 There are two other alternatives.     
 Firstly, you can sometimes choose to  
 go to a comprehensive school at       
 Carnforth which is in Lancashire.     
 Secondly you can sometimes go to Queen
 Elizabeth's School in Kirkby Lonsdale,
 Cumbria if there is room. If you have 
 passed the 11+, or if you have an     
 older brother or sister at Queen      
 Elizabeth's School, there is more     
 chance of you going there.
