		<title>15Farming - Nursery</title>
		<content> The nursery has been open for 7 years 
 and is an annex to the one in Rode    
 Heath-a family firm for 3 generations.
 The nursery is on 7 acres of land and 
 the main occupation is growing shrubs 
 for the wholesale trade-garden centres
 and market traders.The most popular   
 plants grown are Leylandii and small  
 conifers. There are 6 plastic tunnels 
 56 and 80 ft. long and 1 net tunnel   
 for the hardier plants. There is a    
 water tank. Trees cannot be grown on  
 the land because the areas is too     
 windy. Most 'liners' or young plants  
 are imported from Holland.            
 Rhododendrons cannot be grown because 
 the soil is too acid. No plant is kept
 longer than 2 years. Most are sold at 
 1 year and 18 month old. The nursery  
 is involved in preparing plants for a 
 Garden Festival to be held locally in 
 October 1986.                         </content>
