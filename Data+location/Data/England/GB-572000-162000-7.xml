		<title>07BURHAM - THE NEW SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Hopes of a new school had all but     
 disappeared but at last in January    
 1984 work commenced on the new        
 building in Bell Lane. The whole      
 village was very excited especially   
 the school children. During the       
 building the children were very       
 involved with the whole atmosphere.   
 They visited the new school site on   
 numerous occasions to monitor         
 progress. They also planted trees on  
 the school site and a {time capsule}  
 was buried outside the front entrance 
 of the new building.                  
 Finally on 3rd June 1985 the old      
 school was vacated and the new        
 occupied. It was a very exciting time 
 for all concerned. Now the children   
 can see out of the windows, all       
 facilities are under the one roof in a
 modern building.
