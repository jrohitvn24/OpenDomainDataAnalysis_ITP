		<content> The Somerset Trust for Nature         
 Conservancy manages 29 acres as a     
 nature reserve at the northern end of 
 the lake and there are nature trails  
 with leaflets available at the start  
 near Bessom bridge.                   
 There are facilities for disabled     
 people and severely disabled anglers  
 may take their cars off the main car  
 parks right down to the waters edge.  
 Fishing in the lake is good and last  
 year it was stocked with 20 000 trout!
 Traditional fly fishing is allowed,   
 the season running from 1 May to 31   
 October and from one hour before      
 sunrise to one hour after sunset.     
 Daily permits cost Â£5.20 (Â£4.20 for   
 OAP, students and RDP) and Â£1.20 for  
 children under 16.                    
 The bag limit is 5 fish per day, 2    
 fish for children. Boats may be hired 
 from 9.00 am each day.                </content>
