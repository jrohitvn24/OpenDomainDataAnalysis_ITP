		<title>01The area around Bredfield</title>
		<content>     There are four villages in this   
rural area, Boulge, Debach, Dallinghoo 
and Bredfield, which is the biggest,   
having a pub, a primary school, a      
village hall, a chapel, a church and   
a shop with a post office. Dallinghoo  
also has a church, a village hall      
and a shop with a post office.         
     In the past there were many small 
mixed farms in the area but now most of
the surrounding countryside is used for
arable farming as the soil is clay and 
is good for growing cereal crops.      
There are different forms of farming   
as well, three small dairy farms, a    
battery egg unit and a small pig unit. 
     There are some small woods, which 
are used for shooting game, mainly     
pheasant and partridge, scattered      
around the farms.
