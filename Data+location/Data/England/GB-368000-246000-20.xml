		<content>   The information in these pages was  
 collected by pupils of Ellerslie      
 School.  This is an independant school
 of about 270 girls, aged from 11 to   
 18.  Second year girls undertook the  
 survey.                               
   The area covered was about 10 miles 
 from the school and so the survey     
 necessitated a day out and represents 
 a concentrated effort for that time.  
 The preparatory work was done by      
 the geography teacher.                
   The girls enjoyed taking part in the
 survey, although the area gave little 
 scope for variety as it was entirely  
 devoted to farming.
