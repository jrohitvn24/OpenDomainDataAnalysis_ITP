		<title>06BURGHFIELD-HENRY WILLINK</title>
		<content> The Willink School is named after     
 HENRY GEORGE WILLINK (1851-1938),     
 lawyer,traveller,mountaineer,who lived
 in the area.Born in Liverpool and     
 educated at Eton and Oxford,Willink   
 settled in Burghfield in 1890,becoming
 chairman of Bradfield District Council
 and a County Councillor and Alderman. 
 Willink was interested in education   
 and was chairman of the local educa-  
 tion committee and vice-president of  
 Reading University Council.           
  The land on which the school was     
 built in the 1950s was given to the   
 education committee by Major Dent,a   
 relative of Willink's wife.Complaints 
 from a lady at Boldrewood (a large    
 house-now demolished) led to the      
 school being built on the far side of 
 the field from the village.Mrs Bland's
 Infants School shares the same plot of
 land.                                 </content>
