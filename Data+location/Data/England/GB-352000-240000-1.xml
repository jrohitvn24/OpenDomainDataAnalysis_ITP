		<title>01THE SURVEYED AREA - HEREFORD</title>
		<content>    The surveyed area includes the     
 eastern outskirts of the City of      
 Hereford, the village of Lugwardine   
 and parts of the villages of          
 Withington and Shellwick.             
    It is dominated by the flood plain 
 of the River Lugg, known locally as   
 the Lugg Flats and the land rises     
 steeply to the east and west.         
    The flats may be flooded twice or  
 thrice a year following heavy rain    
 or snow and vast flocks of ducks and  
 geese are attracted from the Severn   
 Estuary. Cattle make use of the       
 fertile natural pastures when         
 conditions are suitable.              
    Population pressure has resulted in
 virtually all of the building land    
 within the City to be developed.      
 Elsewhere the emphasis is on          
 agriculture with cattle and grain     
 being important.                      </content>
