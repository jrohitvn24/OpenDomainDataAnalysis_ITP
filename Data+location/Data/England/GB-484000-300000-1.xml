 The area is predominantly rural, but  
 includes the villages of{Ayston,}     
{Preston}and Ridlington, as well as    
 then northern tip of{Uppingham.}Much  
 ofthe landscape is a patchwork of     
 intensively cultivated fields. There  
 is no extensive common land, bodies   
 of water or woodland. The field       
 boundaries are usually hedges; stone  
 walls are rare. The major structural  
 change in the last few years has been 
 the building of the Uppingham         
 by_pass,opened in June 1982.          
 A Forestry Commission plantation,     
{Wardley Wood,}occupies the south_west 
 corner. This wood used to be a Site   
 of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) 
 but the extensive planting of         
 conifers has decreased the natural    
 history interest. A motte and bailey  
 castle site overlooks the wood.       </content>
