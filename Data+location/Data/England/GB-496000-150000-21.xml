<title>21A School Day in 2011</title>
<content>

I wake up at 7:30 then get ready to try to be in the car by 8:10 my school is only a short drive away on the Park Barn Estate and my sister's in just outside the town to the south on the old Farnham Road. We have form registration which starts at 8:30, we normally just talk to our mates and friends and share stories if something happened on Facebook the night before or the latest news.It finishes at 8:55 and we have a Year Assembly on a Thursday. We have a timetable by days like most secondary schools in the country. So it differs what lesson I will have each day and week. My morning break is at 10:55 and finishes at 11:15 after 2 two hour lessons. Then Lunch is at 1:15 and stops at  2:00 for an the last hour lesson which follows through till the end of the day at 3:00   &lt;br />
