		<content>     Nearly everybody walks or cycles  
 to school, but some who live out of   
 the village come by car.              
     We can go into school or play out 
 until the whistle goes at 9.00, then  
 we read or choose some work until     
 Assembly at 9.15. We spend the morning
 doing Maths or English, with a        
 playtime at 10.45. Some days we watch 
 school television programmes. On three
 days a week we have the computer in   
 our class.                            
     A few go home for dinner, but most
 bring packed lunch or stay for school 
 dinner. Then the boys play football or
 cricket, and a lot of girls play on   
 roller skates until school starts     
 again at 1.00 p.m.                    
     In the afternoons we do things    
 like art, drama, games, sewing, craft,
 history, science, geography and music.
 Then at 3.30 we go home.              </content>
