		<content> Olands house itself is a 19th century 
 building with beautiful plaster       
 ceilings covered with roses.It        
 has a big kitchen,sitting and dining  
 rooms.The house has many bedrooms and 
 a snooker room.The grounds are also   
 very big.Vegetables are grown behind  
 the house and the front garden is lawn
 where the children ride their bikes   
 and play cricket.The children at      
 Olands live away from their parents   
 for a while because of family problems
 or arguements.It is called an         
 assessment centre and is run by the   
 social services.The children go to    
 schools in Taunton and Wiveliscombe.  
 Every summer they hold a dog show and 
 garden fete,when the house and grounds
 are open to the public.
