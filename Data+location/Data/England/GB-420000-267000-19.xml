		<title>19EDUCATION IN ROWINGTON AREA</title>
		<content>School childrens attitudes: Most of the
children we interviewed seemed to enjoy
school life, but like all children they
critised school work, teachers and     
their friends.                         
School transport: The only school oper-
ating in the Rowington area was Hatton 
Primary School. The children travel    
from local villages, sometimes a 15    
minute drive, the furthest coming from 
6 miles away. After they leave they go 
to Stratford High, Henley in Arden or  
a private school. There is then a bus  
(from Hatton to Stratford) but many go 
in private cars.                       
Recreation in School: The children in  
Hatton Primary School were aged        
between 4 and 11. The younger children 
played imaginary games, tig and        
climbed on the metal frames.  The boys 
enjoyed a game of football. Girls      
played skipping games and catch.       </content>
