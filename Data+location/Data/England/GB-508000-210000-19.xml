		<content>  {ST.MARY'S CHURCH}is situated at the 
 south west of Redbourn.It stands at   
 the end of{CHURCH END}near the Hemel  
 Hempstead Road.It is the{Parish Church
 of Redbourn and is probably the oldest
 building in the village.Parts of it   
 are over{800}years old.               
   The{CHURCH }of{ST.MARY'S}as we see  
 it today was built in three periods of
 history.                              
   The Norman Church was built by {    
{RICHARD DE AUBENAY}or{DE ALBIUI }     
 who was the second Norman abbot of    
{ST.ALBANS ABBEY}about 1100.           
   The parts of the origanal Norman    
 Church that can still be seen are the 
{TOWER}and the walls of the{NORTH      
{AISLE.}                               
   The Church has been through many    
 centuries and through many tumultuous 
 times but has remained almost         
 unchanged since the{15th}century.     </content>
