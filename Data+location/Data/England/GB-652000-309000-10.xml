		<content> BURE PARK, GT. YARMOUTH               
   Bure Park is approximately 60 acres.
 In the early 1980's there was talk    
 of turning the site into a camping    
 area,but on 1.4.83 the pitch and putt 
 course was opened. The course then had
 12 holes, but was extended to 18 holes
 in 1985. A picnic area was constructed
 to the south.                         
   "Me &amp; Hannah (sic) often visit the  
 Park because it's close to my house.  
 We take dogs there because there's    
 loads of room for them to run. We     
 usually stay for about 2 hours.       
   I think Bure Park is amusing and fun
 because there is loads of things to   
 do, and lots of space to play in      
 without notices telling us NOT to do  
 things. Afterwards we go down to the  
 Amusements."
