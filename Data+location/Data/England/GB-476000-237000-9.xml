		<title>09Geography-Calverton area</title>
		<content>PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-The area was gently 
undulating and varied in height above  
sea level from 69 ft to 89 ft.There    
was no large natural wood cover but    
small copses and odd trees were dotted 
around.                                
    The River Great Ouse  flowed       
through our area in a SW -NE           
direction. For 1.5 kilometres near     
Passenham the river split and followed 
two courses before rejoining east of   
Passenham.                             
    There were some water filled gravel
pits at  47722389(National Grid        
co-ordinates).The soil in and around   
Calverton was very clayey,and          
largely suitable for rough grazing     
with some arable farming possible.
