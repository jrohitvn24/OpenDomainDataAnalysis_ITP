		<title>01HIGH HAM &amp; SURROUNDING AREA</title>
		<content> The village of High Ham is 100m. above
 sea-level on a hill rising sharply    
 from the moors below. The hamlets of  
 Beer, Aller, Low Ham &amp; Henley cluster 
 round the foot of the hill. This is an
 agricultural area, mainly dairy       
 farming with some cereals and other   
 crops grown. The majority of the some 
 600 inhabitants work outside the area.
 A few run businesses from their homes 
 e.g. computer companies and crafts.   
 High Ham has a thriving Primary School
 which provides many after-school clubs
 for the children. Many community clubs
 are run from the village hall: Women's
 Institute, Over 60's, Playgroup, Youth
 Club. High Ham has a private secondary
 school. Many visitors come to this    
 unspoilt area with its buildings of   
 blue lias stone, its panoramic views  
 over surrounding countryside, plus the
 only thatched windmill in the country.</content>
