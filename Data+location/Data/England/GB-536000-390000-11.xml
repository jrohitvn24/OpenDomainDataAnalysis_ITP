		<title>11FARMING</title>
		<content> One local farm which is typical of the
 area covers 325 acres. It is a mixed  
 farm with pigs, cattle and crops such 
 as barley, oil-seed rape, peas and    
 wheat. Grass is grown to make silage  
 for winter feeding the 74 cows. The   
 barley is used to feed the pigs and   
 some of the wheat is sold to a local  
 dog biscuit factory. The peas are     
 grown under contract to a frozen food 
 company who have a processing factory 
 in Grimsby. Cooking oil is obtained   
 from the seeds of the rape plant.     
 Machinery plays a large part in the   
 running of the farm, where there are 9
 tractors, one of them is 30 years old!
 The 340 year old farm has amongst its 
 15 buildings, 4 corn sheds, a         
 machinery store, cow sheds and a      
 piggery.
