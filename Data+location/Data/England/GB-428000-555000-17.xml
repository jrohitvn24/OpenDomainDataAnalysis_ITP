		<title>17WASHINGTON STREET GAMES</title>
		<content> In one of Washington's streets we play
 a game called 'British Bulldog'.It is 
 played with more than two people.One  
 person 'on',that person stands in the 
 middle of the road the other people   
 stand at one  side of the road.The    
 other person that is 'on' calls a name
 of someone playing the game.The person
 who is picked says "British Bulldog"  
 and everyone runs across the road     
 without being touched by the person   
 who is 'on'.When a person is touched  
 they are 'on'with the other person    
 until everyone has been touched.When  
 everyone is touched the person who was
 touched first is 'on'.After it is all 
 finished the game is played over      
 again.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
