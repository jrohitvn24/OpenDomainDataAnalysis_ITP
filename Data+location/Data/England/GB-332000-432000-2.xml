		<content> hypermarket and several nationally    
 known furniture,carpet and D-I-Y      
 outlets.                              
                                       
 This region of Blackpool is the one   
 that is at present undergoing         
 considerable changes with infill      
 building and the development of former
 semi-agricultural land.It is the part 
 of the famous seaside resort that is  
 rarely seen by the visitor although   
 the{new link road to the M55}will     
 carry visitors high above the district
 along an embanked carriageway enroute 
 into the town centre.                 
                                       
 The new link road will also provide   
 many of the present and developing    
 industrial and commercial             
 organisations with easier access to   
 their suppliers and customers via the 
 M55/M6 Motorways.                     </content>
