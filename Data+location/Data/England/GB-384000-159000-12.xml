		<title>12VIEWS ON STAVERTON BY-PASS</title>
		<content>   "I truly wish that there could be a 
 by-pass that could take the traffic   
 away from Staverton. I don't think    
 that the proposed by-pass is a good   
 idea because it takes traffic away    
 from a small bit of the village only."
   "The foundations of the older houses
 in the village were not built to      
 withstand the vibration caused by     
 heavy traffic."                       
   "Both proposed routes will isolate  
 the school from most of the village. I
 think that keeping Staverton School   
 open is one of the most important     
 things for the life of the whole      
 village. I have seen villages where   
 the school has closed and it has made 
 them dead villages with no sound of   
 children playing in the playground."  
   "Much agricultural land would be    
 lost and it would cut some farms in   
 half."                                </content>
