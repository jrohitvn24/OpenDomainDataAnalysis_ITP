		<title>13ANIMALS OF ASHDOWN FOREST</title>
		<content>   The largest animal on the Forest is 
 the fallow deer sometimes seen at dusk
 or early in the morning.  The fox and 
 badger are both fairly common but the 
 hedgehog keeps mainly to the edge of  
 the forest as does the mole, there not
 being many earthworms in the acid     
 forest soil. The dormouse is found in 
 some hazel stands but is becoming     
 rare.  Shrews too are found, the      
 common, pygmy amd water shrews, and   
 the rabbit mainly in the more fertile 
 valleys as the construction of warren 
 tunnels in the forest soil is         
 difficult.                            
   Mink now hunt many of the streams;  
 smooth and crested newts can be found 
 in the forest pools and grass snakes  
 nearby.                               
   On the drier areas adders and the   
 common lizard are to be seen in fairly
 large numbers.                        </content>
