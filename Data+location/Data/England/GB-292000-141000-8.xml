		<content> We learn tables but we also do        
 weighing in grammes,measuring in      
 metres although sometimes in shops    
 they still use yards,and volume in    
 litres even though our milk comes in  
 pints.We write our own stories and    
 poems.We all love reading and read to 
 our teacher every day as well as      
 choosing other books to read in our   
 free time.Every year we have a school 
 outing with the parents and playgroup.
 We might go to Watermouth Castle or   
 Cricket St.Thomas. Sometimes when we  
 are doing projects we go to museums.In
 the summer term the Juniors go to     
 Pinkery Camp.We have a Harvest        
 Festival in October in school.We have 
 Fireworks on Bonfire night in the     
 field.We have a lovely Nativity Play  
 and Carol Service in the Church at    
 Christmas when we sing and sing and   
 sing.                                 </content>
