		<title>13FRISKNEY ALL SAINTS CHURCH</title>
		<content> The present church was founded in     
 1247. Parts of the original Norman    
 church (1135) still exist. The church 
 has been extensively added to over the
 years. An outstanding feature are the 
 murals which were rediscovered last   
 century. The church has 48 acres of   
 land let in 1 or 2 acre plots to      
 agricutural workers. The income was   
 used to pay the Schoolmaster but it is
 now used for the upkeep of houses     
 for the elderly and the Christmas     
 Distribution. The church plays an     
 active part in village life-Mothers   
 Union, Sunday School, bellringers,    
 magazine, choir and many and various  
 fund-raising events.The parish has    
 combined with Thorpe and the the Rev  
 R.File is Vicar for the combined      
 parish. There are plans for a new     
 Vicarage to be built near the         
 existing one.                         </content>
