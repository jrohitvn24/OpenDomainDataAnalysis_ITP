		<title>13Burton Latimer - Transport</title>
		<content>Burton Latimer is a town on the main A6
trunk road from London to Carlisle. A  
study of the traffic coming into the   
town showed the quantity of traffic &amp;  
the type and it was also possible to   
see the most dangerous places.More cars
used the roads through the town than   
any other vehicle, but a number of very
heavy goods vehicles go through the    
very narrow High Street, causing much  
noise and vibration.                   
 Many local people think that there    
should be a byepass.                   
 On the next screen page is a diagram  
showing the results of a traffic survey
conducted at 9.15 am. on consecutive   
days at 5 points around the town in    
May 1985.
