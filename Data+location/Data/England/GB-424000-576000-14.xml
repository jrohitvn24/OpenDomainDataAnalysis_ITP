		<content> Cramlington has no cinemas,theatres or
 concert halls. The main entertainment 
 for adults seems to be in the many    
{pubs}and{social clubs}in the town,    
 which are all very popular. Many of   
 these run{discos}for the younger      
 adults in the town,but there is very  
 little for the younger teenagers.     
 There are a lot of{clubs}and{societies
 in the town, and many people find     
 their entertainment through their     
{hobbies}or{sports.}Youth organisations
 like{Scouts}and{Guides}are popular,   
 and so are the many school centred    
{youth clubs.}The Concordia{sports     
{centre}gives entertainment to many    
 local people. There are several video 
 hire shops in the town and many people
 hire{video}films to entertain         
 themselves at home. An attraction in  
 the summer months is the annual town  
{carnival.                             </content>
