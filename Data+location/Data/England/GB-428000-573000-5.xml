		<title>05The Coffee Morning.</title>
		<content> On{Tuesday, 21st May}we arranged a{   
{Coffee Morning}in school for the old  
 people of Seaton Delaval. About 25    
 people came and were interviewed in   
 groups. We showed them around school, 
 and many who had attended this school 
 were amazed at the changes they       
 noticed. One lady,{Mrs. Ethel Newton  
 said that the most expensive thing she
 had ever bought was a dining room     
 suite which is now 44 years old. She  
 bought it at the Co-operative Society 
 at the Avenue Head. Their favourite   
{sweets}were aniseed balls, gobstoppers
 and chocolate mice. The thing that    
 sticks in my mind from the Coffee     
 Morning was that at night, Mrs. Newton
 told us that she and her friends would
 walk up to the Avenue Head and sit and
 chat together. The corner where they  
 met was called{Dicky Bird Corner!}We  
 kept a Visitors Book of the day.      </content>
