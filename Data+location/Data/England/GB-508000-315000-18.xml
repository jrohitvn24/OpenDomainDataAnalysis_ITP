		<content> We had a discussion with our class to 
 see what we did in our spare time.We  
 found out that everybody watched T.V. 
 Eastenders is the most popular series.
 The big thing with the boys is soccer.
 In our class we have quite a few of us
 who go swimming, riding, and skating. 
 Everyone in our class has a bike. Most
 people have a racer or B.M.X. A lot of
 people like reading. Favourite authors
 are Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl. Half  
 the boys go to Cubs but only two girls
 go to Brownies.Most nine and ten year 
 olds go to Youth Club on Monday night.
 A lot of people have a computer which 
 they play games on. Most of the class 
 go to Gym Club on Monday after school.
 Quite a few people have electric train
 sets.Building Lego models is enjoyed  
 by girls and boys.Technical Lego is   
 used mostly by boys.A few people are  
 starting to learn to play tennis.     </content>
