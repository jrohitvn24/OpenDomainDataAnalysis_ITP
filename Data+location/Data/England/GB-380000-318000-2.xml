		<content>     The name "Gnosall" in Norman      
times was "Geneshale" which when       
translated means "village  in the      
valley"                                
Domesday entry                         
  In 1086, the Domesday entry for      
Geneshale was 2 hides (100 hectares)   
and 3 virgates (37.5 hectares). There  
is enough land for two ploughs. On the 
lord's land there are 4 ploughs. There 
are 8 villagers who own land and 4 who 
do not. There is a mill worth 12d. The 
village is worth 15 shillings.         
1680                                   
  In 1680 there were not many houses   
near the church but there were a few   
houses at Audmore which is NE of the   
church.                                
1980's                                 
  Now there are large housing estates  
round the church which have joined up  
with Audmore.                          </content>
