		<title>20THE BRIDGE AT MONTFORD</title>
		<content>    The village of Montford Bridge is  
 quite spread out, but with the focus  
 of its 400 inhabitants at the bridge  
 over the River Severn.                
    The site has been a crossing point 
 on the river for hundreds of years,   
 having originally been a ford.        
    The present bridge was first built 
 in 1735 by French convicts.  The      
 designer, Thomas Telford, also        
 planned the A5 which passes over it.  
    The bridge is constructed of       
 sandstone blocks. These came from     
 Criggan, a nearby quarry with good    
 access to the Severn.
