		<content> In the village of Wolvey there is a{  
{BAPTIST CHAPEL.}It was built in 1784  
 and is situated off the main Coventry 
 to Hinckley road in School Lane.      
 Regular{SUNDAY SERVICES}are held      
 there. About a hundred years ago there
 were so many members that a balcony   
 had to be added in the Chapel,which   
 meant it could hold over two hundred  
 people.Since the end of the second    
 world war numbers have dwindled to    
 around fifteen. Mr.Davies, a Baptist  
{MINISTER}who comes from the nearby    
 town of Bedworth, sometimes takes the 
 services. A Committee runs the Chapel 
 and members of the Committee have been
 connected with the Chapel all their   
 lives. Mrs.Eunice Elliott remembers   
 going to the Chapel{SUNDAY SCHOOL}as a
 girl over seventy years ago.The Sunday
 School still runs in a room above the 
 main Chapel.                          </content>
