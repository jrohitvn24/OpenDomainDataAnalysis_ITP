		<content>     This road which is linked to      
 General Wade's military road in the   
 North was used annually by {cattle}and
{drovers}travelling South to the cattle
 markets held at Crieff, Falkirk and   
 South of the border.  The road exits  
 across the ford at the{River Earn}to  
 the South of{Crieff.                  
     Drovers would travel from as far  
 North as the Highlands and Islands.   
 When on the mainland they would follow
 a course of drove roads South to the  
 markets.                              
     It was much easier to use drove   
 roads than the hard, metalled roads   
 made by{Maccadam}or{Telford.}The      
 grassy drove roads on which cattle    
 could graze required{no payment,      
 unlike the other roads where tolls    
 were levied .                         
    {Highlandman Loan}is now a proper  
 road and is used daily by motorists.  </content>
