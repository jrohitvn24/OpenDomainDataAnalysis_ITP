		<content> A wide variety of housing was found,  
 from flats and maisonettes to detached
 homes. Most houses were semi-detached 
 or terraced, built just before the    
 (second) war. The oldest housing found
 was 175 years old and was terraced.   
 This was in the older town part of our
 area. The newest  properties were 2   
 and 3 bedroomed semi-detached or      
 terraced houses built in small closes 
 by large private developers which     
 filled spaces between other areas of  
 housing. Many properties were council 
 owned, although some of these had been
 purchased by their tenants. Some      
 houses were pebble-dashed or faced in 
 decorative brick but most were built  
 of red brick, particularly the council
 houses. most of the houses had small  
 gardens but few had garages - these   
 were often away from the housing in   
 small rented blocks.                  </content>
