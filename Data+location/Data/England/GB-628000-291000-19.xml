		<content> In addition to the 2 pubs &amp; Woodton   
 village shop - which houses the Post  
 Office &amp; offers virtually everything  
 barring butcher's meat - a surprising 
 number of small concerns are run from 
 people's homes.This is a recent growth
 &amp; in Bedingham includes an electrician
 a roofing contractor,a health-food    
 wholesaler,a hairdresser &amp; a precision
 engineering business;whereas Hedenham 
 can boast a silk-printing operator.The
 more usual country services include   
 the family-run milk round,a beekeeper 
 who also grows vegetables for sale,a  
 smallholder who is into specialist    
 Agri-feedstuffs &amp; buildings &amp; who also
 offers a sewage disposal service - the
 majority of us has septic tanks.Heden-
 ham has a man who breeds &amp; trains gun-
 dogs &amp; runs kennels; but farming,the  
 production &amp; selling of crops,stock &amp; 
 milk,is the major business of the area</content>
