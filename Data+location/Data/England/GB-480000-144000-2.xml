		<title>02West Farnham's Old Buildings</title>
		<content>{West Street}contains many buildings   
 dating back to before the 19th        
 Century. The best known are :         
{Vernon House},now the library, is an  
 interesting  historical building.Back 
 in 1648 Charles 1, soon to be executed
 stayed overnight in Farnham with his  
 captors. The blind Henry Vernon was   
 chosen as host because he would be    
 unable to arrange an escape. Charles  
 gave his gold night cap to Henry in   
 way of his gratitude.                 
{Wilmer House}was probably built in    
 1718 and now houses Farnham museum.   
 It has a fine Georgian staircase only 
 found in four other houses in Farnham.
 Architecturally this house is one of  
 the finest examples in Farnham. Its   
 brickwork demonstrates a fine local   
 craftsmanship at its best.            
 Many interesting lanes lead off West  
 Street e.g.Fox Yard, Potter's Gate.   </content>
