		<title>03A Farrier not a Blacksmith!</title>
		<content> There has been a farrier in Lighthorne
 for 355 years; the Cole family has    
 been involved for 75 years.           
    The farriers are very busy but they
 enjoy their work very much.Their      
 customers come from a 15 mile radius  
 to have their horses shod.            
    The farriers had to gain a special 
 qualification(Royal Society of        
 Shoemaking).The shoes last 6 to 7     
 weeks and the hardest part of the     
 farriers' work is the making of the   
 shoes.The metal that is used is mild  
 steel.It takes 40 minutes to make a   
 set of horseshoes and 40 minutes to   
 put them on.                          
    The equipment used is quite new,   
 but the anvil is 80 to 100 years      
 old(the tools are American).All the   
 tools are useful but we think the     
 anvil is the most useful tool.
