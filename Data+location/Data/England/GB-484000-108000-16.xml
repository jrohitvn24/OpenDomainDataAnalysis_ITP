		<title>16Mr.Tony Bleach of Lavant</title>
		<content> Mr.Bleach, whose family owned a       
 transport company, has lived in Lavant
 all his life, which is fifty years.   
 The lorries have been used for        
 transporting goods since 1920. His    
 brother owns 18 lorries at the moment.
 His family have lived in Lavant for   
 about 100 years. The land that        
 Bleach's Garage was built on was      
 bought in 1930. When Mr.Bleach was a  
 teenager he used to belong to a sing  
 along band called The Bevery Boys. His
 interests are Country and Western     
 Concerts. He likes Lavant because it  
 is near the sea and Chichester and is 
 fairly close to London.               
      He hopes that in the future      
 Chichester will not swallow up Lavant 
 by the increase of building between   
 Lavant and Chichester.
