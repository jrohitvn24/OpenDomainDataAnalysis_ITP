		<title>17STARTFORTH CHURCH</title>
		<content>    Startforth Church was mentioned in 
 the orignal Domesday book in which the
 following statment appeared,          
    "At Stradford .......there is a    
     church."                          
    No one knows when the church was   
 first built but it was definately     
 before 1086.The Revd. J.F. Hodgeson   
 describes the old church as,          
    "A small aisless building of       
 Transitional origin."                 
    The present{church}was rebuilt in  
 1863.The font is the only remaining   
 article from the old church.Inscribed 
 on the font are the initials R.E.These
 stand for Robert Ellerton.There has   
 been a church in Startforth for over  
 800 years.The congregation of the     
 church is 30-40.                      
    There have been 42 vicars including
 the present one,Mr.C D'Aguire.
