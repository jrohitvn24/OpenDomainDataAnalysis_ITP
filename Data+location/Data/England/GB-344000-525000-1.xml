 The main route through its area is    
 the A66 dual carriage way linking the 
 west Cumbrian coast with the M6       
 motorway. It is a busy road with      
 industrial and service transport and  
 tourist cars and caravans especially  
 in Summer. It provides a speedy line  
 between Dacre and Penrith for village 
 residents and farmers in the Dacre    
 vally. A survey of traffic taken over 
 1 hour from 11.45am on July 2nd 1985  
 showed over 300 vehicles using end    
 carriage way, making a total of 638   
 vehicles per hour passing through the 
 area. The majority were cars and      
 lorries - the latter carrying a range 
 of goods, frozen food, glass,         
 chemicals, animal foods, furniture and
 fuel. The village of Dacre is served  
 by a rural bus every Tuesday and mini 
 bus for school children daily.        </content>
