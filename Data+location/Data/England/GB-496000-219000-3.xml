		<content> Expansion of the population is having 
 a profound effect on village life.    
    While Totternhoe's population has  
 remained static at around 1500,       
 Edlesborough and Eaton Bray are       
 changing from largely agricultural and
 motor industry workers to middle class
 dormitory suburbs.                    
    As few, if any, 'starter homes' or 
 council houses have been built in     
 recent years, only the more affluent, 
 and hence, middle- to older- age      
 groups can afford to move in. Young   
 marrieds have to move elsewhere.      
    By 1981, there was already a marked
 drop in the proportion of 20 to 30    
 year olds, a fall in the birth-rate to
 well below the national average, and a
 reduced demand for early schooling.   
    Conversely, there has been a big   
 increase in those aged 35-65, and many
 more cars using the narrow roads.     </content>
