		<content>  Occupying some{74.4 hectares}of land 
 Burbage Common and woods are a major  
 feature of the local landscape.  The  
 site lies between two trunk roads, the
 A47 and the A5070. Access to the      
 Common is by three car parks on the   
 A47 together with a number of         
 footpaths.  The common has been       
 designated a site of{special          
{scientific interest.} The common is   
 home to 240 species of flowering      
 plant, 36 types of breeding birds and 
 countless other flora and fauna.  The 
 woodlands are not "ancient", dating   
 back to 1600 AD.                      
 Burbage Common attracts many visitors 
 each year and the pressure this causes
 on the environment has led to the     
 appointment of a Countryside Ranger to
 oversee the management of the area.
