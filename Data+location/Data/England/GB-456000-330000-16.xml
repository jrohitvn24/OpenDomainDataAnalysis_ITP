		<title>16RUDDINGTON ARMY DEPOT</title>
		<content> In{ RUDDINGTON }there is a derelict   
 army depot and the perimeter is four  
 miles long.It was used for the army   
 and then they held used army car sales
 on the site but it closed about three 
 years ago.                            
 My name is Nicalas and I interviewed  
 people to find out what they would    
 like the land used for now. Nine out  
 of ten people said a leisure area     
 would be a good idea.                 
 Then I asked them what they thought of
 the depot when it was open.The        
 question was "Do you think it was a   
 nuisance?"Seven out of ten people said
 yes mainly because of the traffic     
 causing congestion in the High Street.
 One person said it was more of        
 nuisance now because it was becoming  
 an eye-sore.
