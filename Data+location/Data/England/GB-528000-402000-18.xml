 St.Peters Close.They are administered 
 from{Tedder Hall, Manby.}The{council

{signs,lighting,grass cutting, water   
 and{drainage,}and{refuse collection   
 The bin men come to Holton-le-clay    
 once a week.The{households}are given  
{two dust bin bags}for their rubbish.  
  {Trades people}have to{pay}for their 
{bin}bags.Local trades people are angry
 that they have to pay{50p per         
{bag.}Many of them have decided to     
 remove their own rubbish to the       
 council dumps so that they don't have 
 to pay the bag charges.
