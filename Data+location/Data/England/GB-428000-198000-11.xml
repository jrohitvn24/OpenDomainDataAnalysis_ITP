 All the stock is bred by artificial   
insemination, there are no bulls on the
farm. The male calves are kept for beef
and all the fat stock are sold for meat
under two years; there is a milking    
herd of 70 Fresians. All the dairy cows
are kept in a covered yard in winter   
and fed on silage, the beef cattle are 
fattened on barley in yards. The farm  
crops are supplemented by about 100    
tons of commercial feedstuffs.         
 The exact acreage of cereals each year
depends on the size of fields under    
cultivation. This year there were 180  
acres of wheat and 130 acres of barley.
The grass, about 170 acres, is sown    
every two or three years as a break    
crop. After grazing by the milk cows   
most grass is cut for silage or hay. 40
acres of oil seed rape is also grown as
an additional break crop.              </content>
