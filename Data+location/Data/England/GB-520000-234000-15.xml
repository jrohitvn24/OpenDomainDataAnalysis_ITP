		<title>15Pig Development Unit</title>
		<content> The Pig Development Unit on the       
 Stotfold - Hitchin road has been      
 operating under that title for a year 
 since opening in 1985. Before that    
 since 1956 it was the Progeny Testing 
 Station.                              
 When we went in June 1985 there were  
 7OO pigs altogether - 235 sows and 4O 
 boars. The oldest pig was 13 months   
 old and the youngest 3 days.          
 The purpose of the Pig Development    
 Unit is to discover the best way of   
 rearing pigs to obtain the best       
 quality meat comparable to the cost of
 producing it.                         
 When piglets are born they weight 1.5 
 kilos They put on .5 kilo of weight   
 for every kilo of food consumed.      
 When the pigs have ben in the unit for
 19 weeks they are slaughtered and made
 into chops, spare ribs, ham and bacon 
 - everything is used but the squeak.  </content>
