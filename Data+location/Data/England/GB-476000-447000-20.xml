		<content> TRANSPORT. A 1079 (Roman Road)        
 This is a trunk road and very         
 important to the area. Many people    
 commute to and from work, preferring  
 to live in this quiet part of         
 Yorkshire within easy reach of York   
 12 miles distant. There are regular   
 Cattle Markets at York &amp; Beverley so  
 much of the movement on the road is   
 animal transportation. Access to some 
 of the farm fields is also from this  
 road which means delays for road users
 caused by the movement of combines and
 tractors. There are Race Courses at   
 both York &amp; Beverley and many         
 Agricultural Shows in the area so one 
 sees many horse-boxes on the road.    
 Hull is the other link on this road   
 consequently there is much movement of
 container lorries and loads for export
 Visitors from Europe use this route   
 from Hull to York.                    </content>
