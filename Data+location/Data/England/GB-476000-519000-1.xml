		<content> Mostly sea, this block contains a     
 small area of cast at Boulby as well  
 as a headland at Staithes Cowbar Nab. 
 At Staithes the 150ft high scrub      
 covered nab dominates the harobur and 
 old village. The Boulby end is atop   
 200ft high cliff sheer to the rocky   
 inter tidal area below. The grassy    
 farmland above has 3 houses. Beautiful
 views to the east of Staithes and     
 Runswick from the Cleveland way       
 footpath make this a popular area to  
 visit, mostly by hikers on footpath   
 and people visiting nearby Boulby     
 cliffs, the highest in East England.  
 There is a small cafe to cater to     
 their needs which also acts as a      
 census point for the travel. There is 
 a Bed and Breakfast but most visitors 
 continue to Staithes or are day       
 visitors enjoying the unspoilt scenery
 (except for the nearby Boulby mine    </content>
