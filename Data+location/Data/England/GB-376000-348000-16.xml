		<title>16HALMEREND HALL FARM</title>
		<content>Halmerend Hall Farm is one of the      
largest farms in our block.It is owned 
by the Richardson family who have lived
there for over 49 years.Mr Richardson  
however did not know when the farmhouse
was originally built.                  
The land being farmed is over 204      
hectares and includes land which used  
tobelong to Pheasants Hays Farm.Three  
men work on the farm although the whole
family help out when busy.Some crops   
are grown,but the land is mostly grass 
for grazing or cutting as hay/silage.  
Altogather,there are 210 cows on the   
farm and 150 cubical sheds are needed  
for them.The farm also has 5 tractors, 
1 combine harvester and 1 hay bailer.  
Mr Richardson works nearly 100 hours a 
week when very busy e.g. harvest time  
and is also busy when he takes cattle  
to be sold in nearby Newcastle.
