		<title>01Gidea Park Area</title>
		<content> Gidea Park is a pleasant residential  
 district within easy commuting        
 distance of London.Most of the houses 
 are privately owned and were built    
 after 1911 when the area received an  
 award for house design.The average    
 price of a semi detached house in 1985
 is Â£ 55,000 and houses are in great   
 demand.Our survey shows that homes are
 well kept and many have such items as 
 computers, video recorders and        
 microwave ovens.Strict control is kept
 of buildings and trees as parts of    
 Gidea Park are within a conservation  
 area.Several of the larger houses     
 along Main Road have been converted   
 into accommodation for senior         
 citizens.Two of these are run by      
 Romford Baptist Church and another,   
 Jubilee Court, is a complex of flats  
 built by Havering Council in 1977 and 
 overlooks picturesque Raphael Park.   </content>
