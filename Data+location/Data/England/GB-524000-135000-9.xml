		<title>09THE SHOPPING HIERARCHY</title>
		<content> Of 14{neighbourhood shopping centres  
 in Crawley 8 (+ part of 1) are in this
 block. Provision is fairly uniform in 
 size, range and layout. A count shows 
 we don't have the 2 biggest, and that 
 ours are classed as{large:-}Gales Dr  
 (3 Bridges), Tilgate Pl, Ifield Dr,   
 Southgate Pde;{small:-}Gossops Pde,   
 Dorsten Sq (Bewbush), old West Gn;    
{local:-}Ewhurst Rd (West Gn), Downland
 Pl (Southgate W) and corner shops in  
 Ifield Gn. Some households are much   
 better served than others- distance to
 shops (and town), mobility and number 
 of shops. Numbers vary from 8 food, 1 
 take-away, 11 nonfood shops in Tilgate
 to 2,1 and 4 in West Gn. Planners     
 encourage convenience shops but a few 
 specialist ones serve a wider market  
 on a cheaper site than in town. C.B.D.
 shops offer the same chain stores as  
 elsewhere including department stores.</content>
