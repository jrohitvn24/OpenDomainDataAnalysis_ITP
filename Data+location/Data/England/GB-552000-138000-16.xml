		<content> The most common pets to be found in   
 this area are dogs and cats. Popular  
 breads amongst the former are         
 Labradors, Collies, Spaniels and      
 Golden Retrievers, while cats are more
 often of mixed breeds though one can  
 see the short haired Siamese and      
 Burmese occasionally and the long     
 haired Persian breeds. Among small    
 caged animals, Guinea Pigs, and       
 Hamsters are popular. Rabbits, more   
 varied than their wild counterparts,  
 are sometimes given quite large areas 
 of freedom. Many coloured Budgerigars 
 are popular birds bred in captivity   
 and insecure if released. Although not
 really 'pets' the occasional Chicken  
 or Lamb has become tame and part of   
 the household. Some Geese are used as 
 'guards'. The most unusual pets we    
 have encountered are a Donkey, a      
 Stoat, and two Lucas Terriers.        </content>
