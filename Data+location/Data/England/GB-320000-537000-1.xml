		<content> Ireby village is situated in the      
 valley of the river Ellen some 7 miles
 south of Wigton, 11 miles north-east  
 of Cockermouth and 11 miles north of  
 Keswick.                              
 The surrounding country is hilly, but 
 is mostly farmland rather than high   
 fell.In addition to many isolated     
 farmhouses, there are a number of     
 small villages or hamlets around      
 Ireby: Boltongate to the north,Sandale
 to the north-west,Aughertree to the   
 east,Uldale to the south-east,        
 Ruthwaite to the south, High Ireby to 
 the south-west and Whitrigg and       
 Torpenhow to the west.                
 Ireby was an important market and fair
 town in times past and although it has
 declined in this context, it remains  
 an important village being one of the 
 highest in population in the district.
