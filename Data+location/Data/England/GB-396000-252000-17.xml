 A long time resident of Naunton       
 Beauchamp described her village as    
 'hobbyists generally as there are many
 retired people'. Retired or not the   
 area can produce a thatcher, 2        
 landscape architects, an upholsterer  
 who does boat fittings and many       
 tailors and dressmakers. A local      
 farmer's wife is renowned as an expert
 lecturer in flower arranging. There is
 also a taxidermist, calligrapher and a
 painter of animals and flowers. For   
 the last few years a group of local   
 ladies have been singing regularly as 
 the Lenchton Ladies Choir at functions
 and church services. It would be fair 
 to say that whilst there are no       
 organised Art /  Craft Clubs there are
 many talented individuals who give and
 gain great enjoyment from their       
 activities.                           </content>
