		<title>10Housing in Talke</title>
		<content>  In Talke there are lots of different 
kinds of housing.There are still some  
very old houses left,they are mostly   
terraced with no front gardens and     
narrow entries leading to the back of  
the houses.Many old houses have been   
knocked down leaving large open spaces 
for playing on.There are estates of    
council houses,most are semi-detatched,
although some are in blocks of         
four.They were built soon after the    
1939/45 war,and all have gardens.They  
were all rented from the council but   
now some people have bought their      
own.There are small estates of private 
houses which have been built during the
last twenty years to fill the spaces   
between existing areas of housing.There
are a few blocks of rented flats,but   
these are only two or three stories    
high.There are no tall buildings in    
Talke.                                 </content>
