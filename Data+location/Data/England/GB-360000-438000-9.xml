		<content> There are two churches; Lee House,    
 Thornley and the Congregational       
 Church at Knowle Green. People within 
 the area also worship at Longridge,   
 Chipping and Ribchester and some      
 people from outside the area attend   
 the two churches.   Non-christian     
 religions are not represented.        
                                       
 Lee House derives its name from the   
 time when Roman Catholic services were
 forbidden by law and the building     
 dates from 1827.   It is part of the  
 Diocese of Salford, but Franciscans   
 and Dominicans have been responsible  
 for it in the past.                   
                                       
 Knowle Green Church was built in 1867 
 but founded in 1831.  Attendance from 
 a wide area is regularly over 80.     
 Events are held in the adjacent Church
 Hall.                                 </content>
