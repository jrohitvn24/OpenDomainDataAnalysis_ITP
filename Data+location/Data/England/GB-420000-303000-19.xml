 Today in 1985 most people have at     
least one television set in their house
and some people have two or even three.
Some people in our class have their own
portable colour television in their    
bedroom.                               
 An increasing number of homes have    
video recorders. On these machines you 
can record programmes which you may    
miss and watch them at your leisure    
some time later. You can hire full     
length feature films for a small fee   
from video shops.
