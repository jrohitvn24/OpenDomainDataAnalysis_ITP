		<title>11At School in Woodlesford</title>
		<content> School starts at 9 00am.We go in for  
 activities and fight for the          
 comfortable chairs in the reading     
 corner.For activities we              
 paint,draw,sew and make all sorts of  
 things.At cleaning up_time we usually 
 miss half of play time because        
 Mr.Butler won't let us out until every
 speck of dust is off the floor.After  
 break we do maths.There are two       
 groups.The first group do maths then  
 change with the second group which has
 been writing or doing reading workshop
 or something.We take the chairs       
 through for dinner at 12 00pm.The     
 dinners are lovely but not everyone   
 has them,some have sandwiches.We play 
 out for an hour then we do reading.We 
 sometimes have P.E. or games in the   
 afternoon or we write stories or do   
 the Domesday.
