		<title>03LAUND HOUSE FARM CONTINUED</title>
		<content> At present there are four hundred beef
 cattle kept in outbuildings at        
 the farm. Normally they are kept      
 outside in the fields until there is  
 no grazing left, but this year, due to
 heavy rain, the ground is very wet,   
 and the animals were making the fields
 very messy, so it was decided to move 
 them inside. While inside, they are   
 being fed this year on potatoes and   
 barley. The reason for potatoes being 
 used as fodder is that this year they 
 have been overproduced and their price
 is very low.                          
 There are two untarred roads leading  
 to the farm. One runs east and joins a
 narrow tarred road. The other runs    
 south-west, going through two other   
 farms. One of these is also called    
 Laund House, the other called Hull    
 Bank. The second road eventually joins
 the A19 north of Skipton.             </content>
