  Stockton on Forest is a village      
 of about 900 people it is only        
 four miles from the city of York      
 but it is a  complete village,        
 rather than a suburb of York          
 like on the other three sides         
 of the city.                          
           The main street is made     
 of houses which are red brick and     
 pantiles.Most are over 200 years      
 old. The most important building      
 is a four storey red bricked mansion  
 called Stockton Hall. It was built in 
 Georgian times. Up until about 1965 it
 was owned by the Agar family but now  
 it is a home for boys who have no     
 parents or those who have got into    
 trouble.The village has one pub called
 "The Fox" where every year the hunt   
 meets outside on one particular day.
