		<title>17Technology-Dymchurch Seawall</title>
		<content> The seawall was started by the Romans.
 The materials used were thorn bushes  
 that were tied into faggots and then  
 left to harden in the sun.The sea-    
 wall that is standing in 1985 was be- 
 gun in the C18.The old core is still  
 there,but is not very strong.It is    
 made of shingle &amp; silt.The grating is 
 tested every year on the surface &amp;    
 underneath to check that it has not   
 started to crumble.To do this holes   
 are drilled &amp; gaps are plugged with   
 cement.It is inspected every year.One 
 hole in the seawall could take one    
 month or one year to repair.It is 7.5 
 metres high and 50-60 metres wide.To  
 repair the seawall it would cost      
 Â£2000000 per mile.It was built to stop
 the Romney Marsh from flooding.The    
 seawall is curved to break the force  
 of the waves.
