		<title>12COMPUTERISED COWS</title>
		<content> Mr.Carrington owns a farm where the   
 cows are milked and fed by computer   
 .In the milking parlour there are bays
 for 14 cows.When the cows are led into
 the parlour Mr.Carrington feeds the   
 number, which is stamped on the rear  
 of the cow,into the computer.The      
 computer then decides how much feed   
 the cow needs and automatically sends 
 the right amount of food into the     
 feeding bowl for that cow.It also     
 decides how much milk that cow should 
 give and after the correct amount has 
 been delivered through the milking    
 machine, the machine to that cow      
 switches off and the machine drops off
 the teets and allows the cow to leave 
 the shed.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
