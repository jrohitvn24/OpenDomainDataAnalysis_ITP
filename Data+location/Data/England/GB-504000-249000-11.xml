 An optician is a person who tests     
 eyesight and sells glasses. We found  
 that women prefer plastic frames,     
 coloured and the prices varied from Â£8
 to Â£50 for the frames. Men liked metal
 frames; they cost from Â£16 upwards.   
 The youngest person they had ever     
 fitted for glasses was only 12 months 
 old. The optician recommends that you 
 come back every two years for further 
 eye tests. These are paid for by the  
 National Health Service.              
 Most people need reading glasses (to  
 correct long sightedness) when they   
 are about 40 years old. On average the
 optician did about 15 eye tests a day.
