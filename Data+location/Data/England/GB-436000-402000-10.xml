		<content> MOST CHILDREN WOULD LIKE A PET OF     
 THEIR OWN AT SOME TIME. I, FOR        
 INSTANCE, WOULD LOVE A HORSE, BUT     
 WE CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP IT. IN SCHOOL
 WE KEEP A LOT OF ANIMALS AND BIRDS AND
 THOUGH THEY'RE INTERESTING THEY'RE NOT
 LIKE HAVING A PET OF YOUR OWN. I      
 THOUGHT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO    
 DISCOVER HOW MANY PETS THE 213        
 CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL HAVE AT HOME   
 AND HERE ARE THE RESULTS:-            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
  DOGS          88    RABBITS       27 
  CAGE BIRDS    26    CATS          25 
  FISH          25    GERBILS        7
