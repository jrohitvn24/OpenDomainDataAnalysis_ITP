		<title>16Employment &amp; Industry</title>
		<content> Most of the employment is on the      
 farms, but in these days of highly    
 mechanised agriculture, not many men  
 work on each farm.  The biggest       
 employer is the Risborough Upholstery 
 situated in Longwick on the main road,
 and here nine people work and also    
 outworkers are connected with the     
 business.  None of the nine actually  
 live in Longwick.  The company        
 provides a comprehensive service in   
 re-upholstering and repairing         
 furniture, also making loose covers,  
 curtains and cushions.  The timber    
 merchants  and farm machinery workshop
 almost next door employs a few people.
 Timber, gates, fencing, and in season 
 christmas trees are sold here.  The   
 Sportsman's Garage at the Eastern end 
 of Longwick is a very busy garage and 
 service shop.  It is a family business
 and employs six people.               </content>
