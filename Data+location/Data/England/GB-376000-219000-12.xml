		<content>   Highnam village has grown very con- 
 siderably in the last decade due to   
 the estate development by Bovis and   
 Lovell Homes.Before this growth       
 Highnam focused on Highnam Court and  
 the associated functions of the       
 estate:the farms,cottages,church &amp;    
 school.Even in 1985 with the new      
 housing nearing completion there is   
 only one general store to serve the   
 largely commuter population who work  
 in Gloucester or further afield.      
   Tibberton,by contrast,presents a    
 straggling appearance with many gaps  
 betwwen buildings which are of mixed  
 age.There are signs that this village 
 too is beginning to serve as housing  
 for folk who work at some distance    
 from the village.The appeal of the    
 country continues for urban folk,     
 helping to infill villages and raise  
 property values.                      </content>
