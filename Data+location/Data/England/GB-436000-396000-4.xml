 over grown it. The{new church}still   
 stands up.The new church has got a    
{steeple}unlike the old church which   
 has a{tower.}The{new church}was built 
 between{1873}and{1877.}The new church 
 steeple is{200 feet high.}The design  
 for the{new church}was also used for  
{Truro Cathedral.}Inside the new church
 everything is clean and well kept but 
 inside the old church there are weeds 
 growing through the floor. The graves 
 around the old church are old and over
 grown with ivy and grass. The graves  
 around the new church are neat and    
 tidy and well looked after.           </content>
