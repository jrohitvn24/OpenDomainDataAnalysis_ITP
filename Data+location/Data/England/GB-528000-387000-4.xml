		<title>04WELTON SPRINGS TROUT FARM</title>
		<content> Situated at an ideal site at the      
 spring head of a tributary of the     
 river Lud, the farm has optimum       
 facility for trout production both for
 consumption and re-stocking. The water
 has filtered through the chalk wolds, 
 and is free from impurities. The water
 volume does not fall below 1,000      
 gals.per minute,enough to produce     
 1,000,000 trout fry and fingerlings   
 annually.Eggs are incubated in a      
 hatchery,then transferred to circular 
 rearing tanks until they reach a size 
 of 75 fish per lb.The final           
 transferance is to growing-out farms  
 in the Louth area.A standard          
 compounded high-protein diet is fed to
 the fish four times daily.            
 Supplying fish farming eqipment to    
 a world-wide market is another        
 activity.
