		<content> There are approximately forty to fifty
 boats set out from King's Lynn.Twenty 
 of these boats go out all the year    
 round.Sixteen boats catch prawns      
 only.The boats have to go out on the  
 high tide, which can be between twelve
 midnight and 10.30am. and they have to
 return twelve hours later on the next 
 high tide. When they return, they are 
 moored in threes and as there is not  
 much room the last in will be first   
 out the following day.
