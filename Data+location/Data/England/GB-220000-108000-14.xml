		<title>14THE BUDE COASTLINE</title>
		<content> The coastline around Bude has rugged  
 cliffs which are about 50 meters high 
 and are made of folded rocks.Several  
 caves are found at the foot of the    
 cliffs.In the cliff at Northcott Mouth
 there is a tunnel carved out of the   
 rock which is said to run about a mile
 inland.In the past it was used by     
 smugglers for storing {contraband.}   
    The beaches are mainly sandy and   
 are totally covered at high.The rocks 
 on the beach are covered with mussels 
 and bladderwort.The tides are very    
 changeable with{spring tides}being    
 about 5 meters high.When the sea goes 
 out you can see the remains of a      
 submerged forest.                     
     Coastal erosion is going on quite 
 rapidly.A bungalow near Northcott     
 Mouth is losing its garden and World  
 War 2 defences have been eaten away.
