		<content> Many social activities take place in  
 our village halls.Stambourne Hall was 
 built in 1861 as the local school.The 
 school closed 26 years ago and a      
 committee was formed to purchase the  
 building.It is now used regularly by  
 Stambourne Players Drama Club,the W.I.
 Silver Link senior citizens' club and 
 for Parish Council meetings,dog train-
 ing,whist drives and similar events.  
 Toppesfield Hall was built by public  
 subscription in 1961 on a site donated
 by brewers Greene King &amp; Sons Ltd.The 
 premises are owned by the Parish      
 Council but are managed by a Board and
 are financially self-supporting.This  
 attractive and well-maintained build- 
 ing,which has been criticised for the 
 inadequacy of the overhead heating,is 
 used regularly by the local school,the
 playgroup,W.I.,Good Companions senior 
 citizens' Club and for private hire.  </content>
