		<content>   The parish church of St. Thomas A   
 Becket in the village of Framfield is 
 part of the Manor of South Malling    
 which belonged to the Archbishop of   
 Canterbury. Therefore its dedication  
 to St. Thomas A Becket is rather      
 appropriate.                          
   The principal part of the present   
 church was built between 1200 and 1250
 A.D. and the first rector was         
 appointed in 1223.                    
   The earliest part of the church is  
 named Hempstead Chapel. At present it 
 is used as a clergy vestry and organ  
 chamber.A smaller Chapel is the       
 Bentley or Gage Chapel. Both Hempstead
 and Bentley were manor farms belonging
 to the Archbishop.This part of the    
 church still maintains the original   
 leaded lights and unusual clear and   
 slightly tinted glass.
