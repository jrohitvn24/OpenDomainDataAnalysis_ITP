		<title>19CHILD'S DAY IN BENINGTON (4)</title>
		<content>This was followed by the Adults talking
and we children watching T.V. After    
about 15 mins. we became bored and my  
sister suggested playing "I Spy". Dad  
joined in and we played for about 30   
mins. I cheated, for a joke, and we    
stopped playing.                       
21.30 hr.Had a drink of coke and then  
set off back home.                     
22.00 hr.Arrived home and I went to my 
bedroom, put on my pyjamas and got into
bed. I read for about 10 mins. Mum came
into my room to say "Goodnight"and told
me to stop reading and get to sleep.   
22.30 hr.Went to sleep.
