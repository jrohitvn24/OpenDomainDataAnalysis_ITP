		<content> Mrs P. is 78 years old and lives in   
 Bulls Cross Cottage. She was born in a
 house just up the road and not in a   
 hospital unlike today where most      
 babies are born. Bulls Cross village  
 has never changed which is very       
 unusual in this day and age, because  
 changes in our environment are always 
 happening. A local man bought Bulls   
 Cross Cottage for Â£50 but a few years 
 ago it was worth over Â£47,000 so now  
 it is worth much more. Bulls cross is 
 a green belt area which means it is   
 protected and cannot be built on or   
 changed. Bulls Cross Cottage was built
 in 1916 but is one of the newest      
 houses in the village the others being
 far older. Mrs P. said if she had a   
 chance she would get rid of all the   
 traffic in the area.
