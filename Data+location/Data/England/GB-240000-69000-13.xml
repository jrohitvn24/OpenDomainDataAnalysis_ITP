		<content>        Calstock  parish   church,  St.
 Andrew's,  is  in  the  south  eastern
 corner of our twelve squares.  A  part
 of the church  is  six  hundred  years
 old.  It has been extended and you can
 see this by the different patterns  on
 the pillars.                          
        One of the interesting features
 is the letter from  Charles 1, written
 at the time of the Civil War, thanking
 the  people  of  Cornwall   for  their
 support.                              
        There are  two  other church of
 England churches in our area, St.Ann's
 is at Gunnislake  and All Saints is at
 Harrowbarrow.                         
        On  Sundays, in  the 3 churches
 Cannon  Ruming,  the rector,  holds  4
 services altogether. At Calstock 50-60
 people attend the morning service  and
 about 25 in the evening.
