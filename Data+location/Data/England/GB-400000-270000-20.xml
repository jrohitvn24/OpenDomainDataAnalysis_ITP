		<title>20Alvechurch Football Club.</title>
		<content>   Many people have heard of Alvechurch
 football club. It was founded in 1929,
 when the  team had to change in a     
 local pub and walk over to the playing
 fields. In 1957 the club moved to Lye 
 Meadow. Alvechurch joined the Midlands
 Combination in 1961 and won the league
 title the following year. In the next 
 8 seasons they won the championship 4 
 times and the League Challenge Cup 5  
 times. In their second year in the F.A
 Cup they reached the first round in   
 1971_72 after an 11 hour marathon     
 against Aldershot, and this was       
 recorded in the Guiness Book of       
 Records. Other famous cup games have  
 been played against Exeter City, and  
 Bradford City.
