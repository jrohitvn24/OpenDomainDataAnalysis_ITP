		<content> The town of Potters Bar is made up of 
 a private housing estate of bungalows 
 and semi-detatched properties.  There 
 was a council housing estate of       
 low-rise flats.                       
                                       
 Property in South Mimms was more      
 expensive.  The Brookside estate to   
 the north of South Mimms was          
 constructed in 1958.  It was of part  
 private and part council housing: some
 of it was of prefabricated            
 construction.  Many of these houses   
 were occupied by elderly people,      
 although it also seemed popular with  
 young couples.
