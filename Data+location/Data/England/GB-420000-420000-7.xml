		<title>07SCHOOL DINNERS - COOK-CHILL</title>
		<content> We get our{school dinners}from        
 Northorpe{Cook-Chill}Production Unit. 
 Twenty eight other schools in Kirklees
 also have meals delivered from        
 Northorpe. The{refrigerated lorry     
 travels 70 miles every day taking 1800
 meals to schools in Huddersfield and  
 the Holme Valley area. 600 of the     
 meals delivered to the Huddersfield   
 schools are prepared to special       
 recipes for{Asian children.           
 Today we had:-                        
 Fish Fingers, Chipped Potatoes and    
 Baked Beans. Followed by Fruit Pie and
 Custard.                              
 The Fish Fingers and Fruit Pie are    
 bothed cooked and chilled at Northorpe
 before being delivered, but the chips 
 ann custard are{freshly cooked}at our 
 school by the cook in charge.
