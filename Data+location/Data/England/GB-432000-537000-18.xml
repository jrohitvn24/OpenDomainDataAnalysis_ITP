		<title>18CASSOP COMMUNITY CENTRE.</title>
		<content> The Community Centre is built in the  
 centre of Cassop. Lots of events are  
 held there including discos coffee    
 mornings over 60's and jumble sales.  
 At the moment the centre is getting   
 an extension put on. It is being made 
 bigger so they can have games for     
 the children. The discos are run by   
 Mr. T. Wilson. He has run them for a  
 long time. there are 2 discos, one for
 the young children and one for the    
 older children. It is the only        
 entertainment in the village for      
 children .The community raises money  
 by having coffee mornings and jumble  
 sales. The money also goes to Cassop  
 Sports Day. We the older children had 
 a sponsored walk which  was 12 miles. 
 If you went you got a free seat on the
 bus which went to Scarbourgh on the   
 disco trip.
