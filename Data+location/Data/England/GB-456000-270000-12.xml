		<title>12TRANSPORT AROUND CRICK</title>
		<content> There are several means of transport  
 available to people in our area.The   
 main two are the motorway and railway.
 There is also a canal.Footpaths and   
 bridle paths also criss-cross the     
 area.                                 
{Motorway.}The first motorway built in 
 the early 1950's crosses this area:   
 M1.The motorway has six lanes; 3 going
 south to London 70 miles away and 3   
 going north to Leeds. Bicycles,       
 tractors,pedestrians and mopeds are   
 not allowed on the M1 but cars,       
 lorries and buses are.Motorbikes over 
 50 c.c. are permitted except learners.
 There is a motorway junction at Crick 
 where vehicles may join or leave. It  
 is Junction 18.The lanes carry traffic
 at diffferent speeds-fast,intermediate
 and slow. The maximum speed is 70 mph.
 Unfortunately there are often road    
 works causing traffic delays          </content>
