		<content>    We have been asking the children in
 our school about the type of{housing }
 in which they live.                   
    The most common type of house is a 
 semi-detatched house with three       
 bedrooms, one bathroom, a lounge, a   
 kitchen and a dining room.            
    Two people live in houses which    
 they use as{shops.}One of the houses  
 is three hundred years old and is used
 as a gift shop and the other is used  
 as a fish and chip shop.              
    We also asked about what type of { 
{heating }people use. The most common  
 types were gas and electricity. Other 
 types were coal, oil and wood.        
    Some people had ways of insulating 
 their{homes.}Most people had loft     
 insulation but only six had double    
 glazing and only one had wall         
 insulation.                           
                                       </content>
