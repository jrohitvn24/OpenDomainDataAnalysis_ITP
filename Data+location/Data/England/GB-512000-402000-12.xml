		<content> husband on the farm because I don't   
 know anything about farming as I was  
 brought up in a town and also because 
 I have no time. I never feel isolated 
 up here as I have my car, but before I
 could drive I did feel isolated. The  
 disadvantages about living up here is 
 that if I run out of anything I have  
 to go to Caistor because they are the 
 nearest shops. I often have visitors  
 but never unexpected visitors. They   
 always ring me before they come. In   
 winter if it snows hard the roads can 
 get blocked but since the airport has 
 been extended the main road is not    
 blocked for long.                     
    I buy as much as town people but in
 the summer I grow as much as possible 
 and what is not eaten is frozen. I    
 cook a main meal at dinner because I  
 know my husband will be home because  
 at tea he is late because of either   </content>
