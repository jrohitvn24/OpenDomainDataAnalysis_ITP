 Forest Lodge School is a comprensive  
 school with 900 pupils &amp; 65 staff.The 
 area covered in the survey is mainly  
 rural and on the Northern edge of the 
 London Boro' of Havering.             
                                       
 There are 2 interesting amenity areas 
 within the section.These are Havering 
 Park &amp; Hainault Forest.               
                                       
 Of particular interest to the pupils  
 of the school were the stables that   
 operate in or near these parks.       
                                       
                                       
 During the Summer of 1985 the school  
 ran a 'Marafun' which included a route
 through Havering Park,along Lodge     
 Lane,through Lower Park Farm,and      
 across the Golf Course returning to   
 school via Lodge Lane.                </content>
