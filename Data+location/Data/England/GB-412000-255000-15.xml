		<content> Here are a few brief notes on some of 
 the houses in Haselor today,          
 especially about those that have been 
 altered. Little Manor used to be five 
 houses with five families living in   
 them. Not long ago it was built into  
 one large house.You can still see the 
 old beams.                            
 Four Gables and Yew Tree Cottage were 
 two derelict,semi-detached cottages   
 but then they were knocked down and   
 rebuilt with new bricks and made into 
 two houses .Mr.Tyrer built Four Gables
 and Mr.Farmer built Yew Tree Cottage. 
 The old blacksmiths shop,across and up
 the road from the school, was taken   
 down and a new house was built with   
 the old bricks.                       
 Ivy Holme has been changed into a new 
 house.You can see the markings in     
 the bricks of a chimney breast,windows
 and a door,these have been bricked in.</content>
