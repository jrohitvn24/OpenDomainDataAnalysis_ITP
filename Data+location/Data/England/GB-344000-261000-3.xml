		<title>03SOCIAL LIFE AND RECREATION</title>
		<content>   Social life and recreation in the   
 area consists largely of private      
 entertaining, watching television,    
 reading, playing records and          
 forgathering in public houses.  The   
 Kingsland Amateur Theatrical Society  
 was revived in 1982, having existed   
 previously from the 1890s to 1920.    
 The Society gives two performances a  
 year with local musicians, the        
 Christmas performance generally being 
 a pantomime.  The Vale of Arrow Choir 
 meets once a week for practices in    
 the school and gives concerts locally.
   "The Hereford Times" and "Admag" are
 published weekly, the latter being a  
 free paper with largely               
 advertisements.  There is a local     
 independent radio station, "Radio     
 Wyvern", which informs the public     
 about local events and news.
