		<content>     The famous{Bakewell Pudding, }more
 often incorrectly called the  Bakewell
 Tart  was discovered by accident  over
 one  hundred  years ago.   A flustered
 cook  in  the {Rutland  Arms Hotel }in
 Bakewell was making a strawberry tart,
 but  accidentally   poured   her   egg
 mixture   over   the   strawberry  jam
 instead  of mixing it into the pastry.
 The  disastrous  strawberry  jam  tart
 turned into a delicious new dish.  The
 guests complimented the owner  of  the
 hotel on the splendid pudding, and the
 cook had to confess her mistake to her
 employer.                             
   The {Old  Original  Bakewell Pudding
{Shop,}which stands in  Rutland Square,
 retains  the  original  recipe, which,
 so it claims,  still  remains a secret
 today.
