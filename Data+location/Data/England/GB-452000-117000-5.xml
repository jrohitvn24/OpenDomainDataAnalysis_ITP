		<content>   The original old{Victorian School   
 building which is on Victoria hill was
 for the Infants and Juniors. They     
 shared the same school building until 
 1969, when a new school was opened at 
{Ridgemede}with lovely big playing     
 fields and this became the local      
{Junior School.                        
   The first headmaster, who is still  
 here today, is Mr John Watts. Over the
 years the school has gradually taken  
 more pupils and today there are       
 approximately 270 children and several
 temporary huts for extra classrooms.  
 The school has a fine{swimming pool   
 which was built in 1979.              
    In 1986 a new{Infants School}is    
 going to be built behind Ridgemede    
 School so we will be Juniors and      
 Infants once again on the same site.
