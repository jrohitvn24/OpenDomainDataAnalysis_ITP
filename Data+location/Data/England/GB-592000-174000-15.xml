		<title>15Walking Towards Sheerness</title>
		<content>         As we walked we looked at the 
{landscape}and houses, (most of which  
 were modern and detached) as well as  
 the{beach.                            
         On the{cliffs}we saw lots of  
 wild flowers such as red and white    
 clover, yarrow, challock and          
 buttercups.                           
         Looking out to{sea}we saw the 
 Olau Line Ferry and there were many   
 other ships such as barges, a dredger 
 and a yawl with all its sails spread. 
         Further along we could see a  
 sand bar which, as it was low tide, we
 could have walked out to.             
         On the other side of the road 
 is the camp site and some rough       
 grazing used mainly for horses.       
         In the distance we could see  
 Sheerness Steel Mill.                 
         We then came to the Catamaran 
 Club.                                 </content>
