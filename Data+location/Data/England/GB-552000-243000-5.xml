		<content> One of the stories that Mrs.Dawson    
 told us was about a man who stole a   
 church plate, and when they found him 
 they skinned him alive and nailed his 
 skin to the door of the church,and    
 years later when the door was being   
 repaired they found some leathery     
 substance and they took it to the     
 Saffron Walden museum and it turned   
 out to be a piece of skin of a blonde 
 haired person going grey. Another     
 story that Mrs.Dawson told us was one 
 about a Parson and his son. Every day 
 they went to say their prayers, then  
 one day the Parson's son died so the  
 Parson bricked up the wall where they 
 used to go through to get into the    
 church to say their prayers and years 
 later when they uncovered the door    
 they found a bees' nest and today we  
 saw where the honeycomb had been, and 
 the next story is a sort of follow on.</content>
