		<title>13Mr.Amey Talking About Pitsea</title>
		<content> Mr Amey is Chairman of our school's   
 Governors. He has lived in Pitsea     
 for nearly 40 years and he came into  
 school to tell us  about the changes  
 in Pitsea over the years.             
   He told us that the roads used to be
 all muddy and narrow and he thought   
 the roads and paths today were better.
 He also told us about the houses.     
 People built tiny homes and used to   
 use them for weekends. Then they built
 extensions on them so they could      
 invite relatives over.Mr Amey thought 
 the houses now were better.           
    Bakers and Grocers vans used to    
 go round selling. There was a house   
 and the people turned the living      
 room into a shop. He thought the shops
 were better now as there was more     
 choice.
