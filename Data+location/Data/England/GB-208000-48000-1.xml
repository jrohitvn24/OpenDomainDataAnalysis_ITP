		<title>01THE GRIBBEN BEACON</title>
		<content>{  This headland has sea around three  
 sides and is called the Gribbin.It has
 lots of small coves and little        
 beaches.When the tide goes out you can
 explore more of the coastline and     
 uncover new and interesting           
 things.Some of the land is owned by   
 the National Trust.The cliffs are     
 about 70 metres high.The Gribbin      
 Beacon is all man made and has some   
 writing just above the door explaining
 it's purpose and erection by Trinity  
 House.                                
 The Beacon is a red and white         
 striped tower which is about 25 metres
 high.It was built as a guide to       
 shipping coming into Fowey over 100   
 years ago.                            
  Saint Catherine's Castle is a ruined 
 fort,built in the reign of Henry the  
 Eighth.Most of the stone walls are    
 still standing.                       </content>
