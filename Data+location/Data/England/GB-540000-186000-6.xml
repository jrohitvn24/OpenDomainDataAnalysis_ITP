 There are lots of different jobs      
 people can do in Redbridge although   
 there is still some unemployment. Many
 people work in shops in large shopping
 centres like Ilford but some of these 
 are closing down because of the high  
 cost of running them. One big local   
 factory is also cutting down on the   
 number of workers it employs. Other   
 people do important work for the      
 council or health services; necessary 
 people such as dustmen and nurses.    
 Nurses especially have to work long   
 hours which has a big effect on their 
 families and home life. A great many  
 people travel outside the area to     
 work, especially to London. This gives
 a much bigger choice of things you can
 do.
