		<title>10Seismatic Survey in Meltham</title>
		<content>    In{June 1985,}some strange vehicles
 came to our area. They were vehicles  
 owned by the{Saxon Oil company        
 carrying out a{seismatic survey.}Saxon
 Oil are a French company on loan to   
 the British Government. They had come 
 to see if there was any{oil}or{gas}in 
{Meltham.}The recording truck was      
 leading then came the vibrator        
 vehicles. The{geophones }pick up the  
 surface waves and that transmits an   
 impulse  by a wire which runs to the  
 recording truck. The{geophones}are so 
 sensitive they can pick up footsteps  
 30 metres away. We will not know the  
 results until{1986.}Will{Meltham}be   
 rich in{oil}and{gas?.
