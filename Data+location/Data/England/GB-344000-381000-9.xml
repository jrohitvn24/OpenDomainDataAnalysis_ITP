		<content>{RENTED}A large proportion of the      
 tenants on the housing estate rent the
 propery that they live in.            
{NEW BUILDINGS }They are in the process
 of building one to three bedroomed    
 bungalows for Senior Citizens and     
 Disabled persons. In the parade, being
 constructed a Leisure Centre Complex  
 attached to the Swimming Baths.       
{URBAN RENEWAL}There has been a great  
 deal of rebuilding taking place in    
 Speke recently. They have altered the 
 three story town houses and made them 
 into bungalows and semi-detatched     
 houses, and in the spaces left where  
 they have knocked them down there are 
 new houses being built or open grass. 
{CHANGE}The Park has been enlarged by  
 knocking down some of the houses and  
 a large number of trees have now been 
 planted on the landscaped hills with  
 many pathways running between them.   </content>
