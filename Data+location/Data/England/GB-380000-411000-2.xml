		<title>02  Benson's Toffees</title>
		<content> Benson's toffee factory has recently  
 been taken over by the larger company 
 of Barker &amp; Dobson. The product line  
 remains similar- chocolate eclairs,   
 toffees, boiled sweets.               
                                       
 The company is an important local     
 employer of about 700 people Many of  
 the pupils at Broad Oak High have     
 close relatives who work there.       
                                       
 The local people can always tell what 
 product is being manufactured each    
 week by the aromas which drift over   
 the area. The employees are allowed to
 eat as much as they want inside the   
 company, but few do after the first   
 week.                                 
                                       
 The company sends its products all    
 over the world from Singapore to San  
 Francisco.                            </content>
