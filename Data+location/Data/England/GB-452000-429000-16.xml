		<content> The Hambleton Gala was started in 1977
 by Mrs.Holland headmistress at the    
 school it was started to celebrate the
 Queen's Silver Jubilee.Until 1982 the 
 gala was held in the school grounds.  
 Then it was moved to St.Marys         
 Approach.As well as the various stalls
 there is a show in the new village    
 hall(Which was paid for by Hambleton  
 Development Committee,who now organise
 the gala).There are quite a few       
 classes to enter.For the last 3 years 
 there has been a display of dancing by
 local schoolchildren.The week leading 
 up to the gala is filled with a number
 of activities to attend,for example   
 this year there was a film show,a wine
 and cheese evening,an organ recital   
 and cream teas,a whist drive,a        
 cabaret,a photographic exhibition,a   
 trip to Bradford Ice Rink and a quiz  
 night which our teachers won last year</content>
