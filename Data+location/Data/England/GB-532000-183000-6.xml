national tabloids.In one paper an      
artical appeared under the title       
'ACHTUNG ISLINGTON'.The left wing      
council has been branded 'communists', 
'marxists',and 'extremists'.The red    
flag flies above the town hall.The     
papers continue to make big things of  
the council's firm support for lesbian 
/gay centres,women's groups.The council
has declared Islington a 'Nuclear Free 
Zone'and have joined the growing       
support of the anti-abolish the G.L.C  
campaign.The councillors with the help 
of the press,have not kept quiet about 
their policies and beliefs.I think     
Islington is a very political area and 
has lots of activities compared to     
other parts of London.Another widely   
covered area is the announcement by    
Chris Smith (M.P) that he is gay.This  
must have taken a lot of courage.      </content>
