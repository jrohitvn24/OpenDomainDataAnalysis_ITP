		<title>08VILLAGE HALL ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content> When Aston Somerville school closed in
 1969 the building was given to the    
 village under the trusteeship of the  
 Parochial Church Council. It became   
 the village hall and is used for      
 social occasions such as harvest      
 suppers, barbecues and discos. It is  
 also used for meetings including      
 Parish Council Meetings. A play group 
 for under 5's, the Womens Institute   
 and Youth Club use the hall regularly.
 Youth Club members age 10+ enjoy      
 snooker, table tennis and darts among 
 other activities. The Village Show    
 held in the hall displays villagers   
 interests with fine examples of       
 painting, embroidery, knitting,       
 cookery, garden produce and flowers   
 with awards given to the best in each 
 class. At present the hall is being   
 extended to provide indoor toilet     
 facilities.                           </content>
