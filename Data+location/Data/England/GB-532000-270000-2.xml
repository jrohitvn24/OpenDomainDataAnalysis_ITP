		<title>02Mr P. A Retired Resident.</title>
		<content> Mr P.age 80yrs, was born in Needing_  
 worth,left school at 13yrs and worked 
 in farming all his life.He has no sib_
 lings or children but many other      
 relatives who live nearby and some in 
 America and Canada.He likes this area 
 and the people and thinks that there  
 are enough facilities here for him but
 not for younger people.               
 The biggest change Mr P.has experienc_
 ed was the changeover from horsepower 
 to powered engines.As for the present,
 he feels, even with high unemployment,
 people are still better off than years
 ago.He thinks that people become more 
 dissatisfied because they see others  
 getting even more.He enjoys all modern
 facilities and likes to go out for a  
 drive in his car with his wife.They   
 like to shop locally to support the   
 village but shop at St Ives and Bar   
 Hill occasionally.                    </content>
