		<content>  There are about a dozen  agricultural
 holdings  in the  parish but only  one
 dairy farm. This  farm  lies  close to
 the centre of the village and has land
 on both sides of the River Witham.    
  With  an  average  height  above  sea
 level  of  35ft. the  water  table  is
 fairly  high  making the farm suitable
 for milk production off grass.        
  125 acres  entirely   down  to  grass
 support 90 milking cows and  50  young
 stock as replacements for the herd.   
  Full time labour  is  the farmer, his
 wife  and  one  employee.             
  All the stock is housed in the winter
 and  forage, obtained  from  the  farm
 chiefly as hay, is  stored  in  barns.
 Brewers  grains are used as additional
 bulk feed  and are readily  obtainable
 locally. Straw  is  plentiful on local
 farms  and  is  used  for  bedding.   
  Three tractors are used  on the farm.</content>
