		<content> Cinemas are slowly dying out.  Films  
 are shown nearly every night.         
 Normally one film is shown for two    
 weeks.  At the Royal Cinema in Cradley
 Heath there is also an arcade which is
 most popular with young people.  It   
 has games machines and snooker and    
 pool.  In our area there are also     
 bingo clubs where prizes can be won.  
 For young people there are youth      
 clubs.  Our school has a youth club   
 with a disco.                         
                                       
 On Saturday nights you can visit the  
 speedway in Cradley Heath where       
 motorbikes race round a track.  It is 
 also used for greyhound racing.       
                                       
 There is also a Civic Centre locally  
 which holds dances and concerts and is
 the venue for Darby and Joan club     
 meetings.                             </content>
