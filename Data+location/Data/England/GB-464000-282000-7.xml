		<content> Mr and Mrs Cave like living in the    
 village because they were brought up  
 in a city.They are living in the      
 village because it is quieter. They   
 are particularly fond of the country  
 side.They used to live in Nottingham  
 and after they got married they moved 
 to Birmingham and lived there for 11  
 years.Then they moved to Lichfield    
 then to Sibbertoft and from there to  
 Husbands Bosworth where they have     
 lived for 6 years. The number of      
 customers they have in a week depends 
 on what is happening.In a normal week 
 they would have between 1000 to 2000  
 people.At other times when they are   
 doing a party they have a few more    
 people.Most of the customers come from
 the villages near by in the winter.But
 in the summer people who are passing  
 by stop.About 60% come from villages  
 and 40%  come in cars that pass by.   </content>
