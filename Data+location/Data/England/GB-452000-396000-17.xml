		<content>  I live in Linden Grove in a brick and
 cement-rendered semi.In our street it 
 is always untidy and dusty just like a
 car park.Too many kids and too much   
 noise;lots of people always arguing   
 and getting hurt.The grown-ups are    
 worse than the kids.In our street     
 there is a dog and it has bit 2 kids  
 and still has not been put down.One   
 Friday a dog got out and it was trying
 to bite a young lad.The lad was trying
 hard to get away.In the end he had to 
 jump up on a van and the dog was taken
 in.                                   
   One of the street games we play is  
 KERBY.You need 2 people and a ball.   
 Each stands opposite the other on the 
 kerb.You have to throw the ball across
 the street to hit the opposite kerb   
 and catch it as it bounces back.If you
 catch it that gives you 2 points,only 
 1 if it hits the kerb and you miss.   </content>
