		<title>05STREAMS NEAR ST.WENN</title>
		<content>  In our St Wenn area we have over     
{eight and a half miles}of streams     
 flowing roughly in straight lines to  
 the{north}where they meet bigger      
 streams or rivers flowing to the{east.
  The pattern of the streams on a map  
 looks like a letter{T}with smaller{ts 
 joining it. It is like a trellised    
 pattern.                              
  We have twelve{springs}but only one  
{pond}in this D. block.There is one old
{mill}race which is all over-grown and 
 three old {water-mills. }             
  There are eight{foot-bridges}and     
 there are two{fords.}There are nine   
{stone}bridges.They are simple{beam    
 bridges because the streams and rivers
 are shallow and easy to span.         
  Our streams and rivers are wonderful 
{habitats}for{fish,amphibians,insects  
 and{birds.}Their banks are full of    
 trees, shrubs and rich undergrowth.   </content>
