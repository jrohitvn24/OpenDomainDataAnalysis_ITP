		<title>16FARMING _ SOUTH ASHFORD</title>
		<content>  The greater part of the farming land,
 adjoins the river area. This flood    
 plain area has been used for rough    
 pasture land, mainly sheep grazing,   
 some store cattle fattening, a little 
 dairy herd work and one or two fields 
 used for horses. Many larger houses   
 have small paddocks alongside. Part of
 this area was used as an emergency    
 airfield during World War II and had  
 American Bombers based locally. South 
 &amp; West shows some slow rise and very  
 gentle hills, the highest being       
 Colliers Hill, 74m above sea level.   
 There are knolls of woodland, but no  
 extensive woodland. Between the clumps
 of woodland this marginally better    
 drained land is used for grain crops, 
 wheat &amp; barley mainly and a few single
 fields of potatoes and broad beans.
