		<title>06 A SCHOOL SECRETARY, BRUTON</title>
		<content>   Miss Collins started work in 1950 as
 school secretary at Sexey's Schooland 
retired in1984.She said she enjoyed    
her work meeting all the new children  
that came to the school through out her
years.She was able to work with five   
headmasters while she was at Sexey's.  
This school was not a complete boarding
school as one third came daily and two 
thirds boarded as they mainly came from
homes in Germany.There were three      
secretaries when Miss Collins left     
Miss Carpener, Mrs.Talyor and          
Mrs.Gardener that works in the sixth   
form center.                           
   Miss.Collins remembers the swimming 
pool being put up in the 1970's and was
able to use it.                        
   She also remembers the old school   
hymn,which was brought in before 1900. 
The present hymn was introduced in the 
1980s. She has seen many changes.      </content>
