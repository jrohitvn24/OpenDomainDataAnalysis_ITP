		<title>07AN ALSAGER CORNER SHOP</title>
		<content> In Alsager there is a shop on the     
 corner of Cross Street and Station    
 Road.  It sells food and sweets as    
 well as table polish, shoe polish, fly
 spray, soap, dusters, mops and lots   
 more.  They have young and old people 
 coming into buy their goods. They are 
 generally busy but it does depend upon
 the weather.  The people who work     
 there, have worked there since 1953   
 which is 32 years.  They are very nice
 and are always ready for a chat when  
 you go in.  It is quite a small shop  
 but it has a lot of things in.  It    
 opens all day on Monday, Tuesday,     
 Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  On    
 Wednesday and Sunday it opens for half
 a day in case you need anything. They 
 sell anything from flyspray to ice    
 lollies.
