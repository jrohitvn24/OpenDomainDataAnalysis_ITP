		<title>19RED HOUSE FARM FOOTPATH ROW.</title>
		<content>   It was reported in the Leamington   
 Courier on June 14th 1985 that Harry  
 and Diana Johnson, who live in Red    
 House Farm, Offchurch ,had been       
 plagued by hooligans and vandals since
 they bought the farm 18 months ago.   
 Now Mr. and Mrs.Johnson are trying to 
 divert the path which at present runs 
 across their front lawn. They are not 
 against ramblers or walkers and they  
 don't want to be mean and stop people 
 coming into the countryside, but at   
 the moment they have no privacy at all
 and suffer continually. Mr Jerome     
 Tucker of the Local Footpath          
 Preservation Group objects to this and
 said if the path is diverted          
 Leamington would be deprived of one of
 its best natural assets. Further      
 objections were raised by local people
 in the following weeks' Courier.
