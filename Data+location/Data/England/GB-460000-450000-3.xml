 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF NICHOLAS.        
 AFTERNOON.                            
 I walked through a footbath and jumped
 into the deep end of the swimming     
 pool.While there we met some girls    
 from our class.When the diving pool   
 opened I jumped off the board as I    
 cannot dive.I left the baths at about 
 4.15pm and walked home.I arrived home 
 at about 5.30pm and had my evening    
 meal.I ate Yorkshire Pudding,roast    
 beef,cauliflower,cabbage,mushy peas   
 and gravy.I was too tired to eat any  
 sweet so I sat in the lounge in an    
 easy chair and fell asleep while      
 watching T.V.I woke up at about 8.30pm
 to find that I was too late to go to  
 Church.I had some crisps and a drink  
 of lemonade  and watched              
 on T.V.I went to bed at 10.30pm.      </content>
