{Alfred's Tower}at{Brewham}is just     
 inside the county of Somerset on the  
 Wiltshire and Dorset borders.This     
 tower was built in{1772}_To the joy of
{Parson Woodforde},who was able to see 
 it erected through his spy_glass,and  
 who tells us about it in his          
 delightful diary.It is supposed to    
 have been built on the direct line of 
 march used by{King Alfred}when he     
 passed from{Brixton Peverell}to{      
{Eddington}in{879}.                    
  The base is made of green sandstone  
 and the walls of red brick,and the    
 upper portion of stone,thought to have
 been brought from the{Chilmark        
{quarries. }
