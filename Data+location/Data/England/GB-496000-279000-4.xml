Mainly stonebuilt cottages. The        
stone is local ironstone and limestone.
Very few houses have been built this   
century and those that have are of     
similar material. There are a few      
brickbuilt houses. Roofs are mainly    
thatch or slate. Some pantiles and hung
tiles are evident. There are some      
terraced cottages which have been      
converted to make spacious homes though
most cottages are detached. A farm     
stands within the village and its      
buildings include a milking parlour,   
Dutch barn, cowsheds and machinery     
shed.
