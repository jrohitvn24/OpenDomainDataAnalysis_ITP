		<content> As the state  of factory  order  books
 fluctuates, workers are sometimes paid
 off or taken on.                      
{ Carr's Mill }was first built in  1885
 and has  always  been one of  the main
 employers in Silloth.The Mill produces
 flour  and  various  kinds  of  animal
 foodstuffs. It provides quite a lot of
 business for the docks. The other main
 businesses  at the dock area  are some
 cattle trade and{Harrison's,} who deal
 in the main with  bulk cement and some
 general cargo.  Recently, the {English
{Industrial Estates}built about 6 small
 factory units to help small businesses
 to set up.                            
{Tourism}also plays an  important  part
 in Silloth - see earlier pages.  There
 are a  lot of shops for  the  size  of
 Silloth because of tourism. The hotels
 cafes  shops  and  caravan  parks  all
 provide lots of seasonal employment.  </content>
