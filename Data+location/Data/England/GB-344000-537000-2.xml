		<content> The 12 square kilometre area is fairly
 well intersected by roads.            
                                       
 The Northeast corner is crossed by one
 kilometre of the M6 Motorway, parallel
 to which at this point runs a similar 
 length of the main Western North-South
 route of British Rail.                
                                       
 From Hutton End to the North and South
 runs an unnumbered country road which 
 is nevertheless well maintained and of
 a fair width. This route is popular   
 for those travelling between Penrith  
 and Carlisle. From Hutton End a       
 similar road runs E. to Calthwaite.   
 These roads total 7km in length.      
                                       
 The remaining roads are paved but     
 narrow, totalling 12km. Surprisingly, 
 the area contains only 1.5km of       
 footpaths.                            </content>
