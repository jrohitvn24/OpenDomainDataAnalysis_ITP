		<content>  Adisham comes under the jurisdiction 
of Canterbury City Council, and is rep-
resented by a Councillor living outside
whose rural area covers four villages. 
Some consider this jurisdiction        
inadequate and believe the old         
Rural District Council of Bridge-Blean 
covering only villages was more        
effective. Generally, however, most    
seem satisfied by the City Council's   
work. The village has its own Parish   
Council of seven who run purely local  
affairs. This considers such things as 
planning applications, and pass recom- 
mendations to Canterbury City Council, 
who can overrule its suggestions. The  
Parish Council also deals with any     
local problems affecting the village   
and the hamlets. There is a Village    
Hall Committee which runs the Village  
Hall and Recreation Ground. Each Club  
also has its own organising Committee. </content>
