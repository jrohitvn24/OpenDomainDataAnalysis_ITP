 There is a  lot of waste ground,      
 abandoned and derelict workshops      
 and warehouses.The roads are unfenced 
 and unlit.There are disused railway   
 lines,broken-down fences,old air raid 
 shelters,a disused anchor and other   
 things lying about.                   
    There are very few                 
 workshops now in  use.We found three  
 men sawing wood and one group of      
 contractors assembling a              
 dredger,working .When the weather is  
 bad the men have to wear special      
 clothing.The docks are now used mainly
 for supplying materials to the        
 Morecambe Bay gas field.There is a    
 large fenced,floodlit area with many  
 large pieces of pipe,cable and lots of
 bits and pieces.
