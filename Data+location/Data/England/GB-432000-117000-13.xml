		<title>13RURAL SETTLEMENT:TEST VALLEY</title>
		<content>  This is mainly a rural area with very
 few settlements,except for 13         
 scattered farms.Many of thes are part 
 of Broadlands Estate and are managed  
 by it.The farm houses and cottages are
 often very attractive and some of them
 are very old.Some are thatched.Newer  
 houses are found beside the A31.There 
 are some very large houses built      
 between Victorian times and today,    
 which stand in extensive wooded       
 grounds.New houses are being built.   
 People who live here probably commute 
 to Winchester or Southampton.         
  There is only one small village,which
 lies on the A36.Wigley shares its     
 amenities with Ower,just to the south,
 where there is a shop and post office.
 The houses vary in age:Wigley Manor is
 old.The village may have lost some of 
 its importance since the M27 bypass   
 was built.                            </content>
