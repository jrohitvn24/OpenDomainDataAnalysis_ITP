		<title>11SMALL HOLDINGS IN CLANFIELD</title>
		<content> In April 1985 Mr and Mrs Bishop       
 purchased the almost derelict Blagdon 
 farmhouse,plus a plot of 1.8 hectares.
 Mr Bishop still maintains his full    
 time employment in nearby Wickham,    
 whilst Mrs Bishop runs the small      
 holding.The property has been acquired
 in case of redundancy and is being    
 modernised.As well as keeping hens,Mrs
 Bishop assists in looking after a     
 small flock of sheep and two horses   
 belonging to a relative.She has two   
 children who attend school locally.   
 She serves on the school committee and
 takes an active interest in the local 
 cub and scout groups.Because of the   
 inconvenience of a public footpath    
 running through the property the      
 E.H.C.C have been requested to        
 re_route the path on the boundary.    
 There has been no objection to stubble
 burning done under strict supervision.</content>
