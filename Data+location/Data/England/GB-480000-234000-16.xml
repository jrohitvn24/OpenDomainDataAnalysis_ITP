		<content> The fountain is an attractive 14th    
 century thatched coaching inn with a  
 small pond at the front and           
 maintaining original timbers and      
 fireplace. It was a private hotel in  
 the 1930s with its own airfield       
 nearby. This popular pub owned by     
 Corage Brewery with its resteraunt is 
 patronised by local people,           
 businessmen and visitors from         
 expanding Milton Keynes. The Lowndes  
 Arms, built in 1550 was renamed as a  
 mark of respect for the Selby-Lowndes,
 who lived in Whaddon Hall, at the turn
 of the century. It is now owned by    
 Aylesbury Brewery and features large  
 fireplaces and these are used for     
 hanging palma hams which are served on
 special occasions. There is a dart    
 board and juke box. Local people enjoy
 the pub for its village atmosphere and
 excellent steak meals.                </content>
