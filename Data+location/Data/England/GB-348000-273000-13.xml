		<title>13LUDLOW ADVERTIZER</title>
		<content>  Ludlow's weekly newspaper the Ludlow 
 Advertizer was founded in 1855 by a   
 man called John Crosse.The earliest   
 copy in the British Museum is that of 
 August 28th 1869.                     
  It was published and printed in      
 various places around Ludlow until it 
 moved to its present building in      
 1932.In 1960 the printing of the paper
 was moved to Stourbridge and in 1984  
 moved to Worcester.                   
  The ownership of the paper passed to 
 the Berrows group in 1971 and since   
 then has become part of the Reed      
 International Group.                  
  Ludlow Advertizer offices are still  
 in Upper Galdeford and the present    
 editor Vince Bufton and 3 staff       
 reporters work there.It is published  
 on Tuesdays and comes out every       
 Wednesday, price 18pence.
