		<title>06THE CLOCK HOUSE IN DUNMOW</title>
		<content> We visited the{Clock House}in The     
 Causeway,it is the oldest brick house 
 in Dunmow.It dates back to 1580 and   
 many parts have been added.Mr Rowell  
 has lived there for 38 years,it was   
 sold by Lady Warwick for Â£1100 in 1920
 Anne Line was the housekeeper in Clock
 House when it was known as Gaston     
 Lodge she used to hide priests in     
 priest holes .She was caught by the   
 Protestants who in those days didn't  
 like Catholic priests.They sent Ann to
 prison where they tried her and       
 hung her in 1601 she came back        
 and haunted Clock House until she     
 was made a saint recently,but she     
 came back and haunted Clockhouse.     
 At the top of the Clock house there is
 a clock dated back to 1651,there is   
 only one other clock like this which  
 is at Dover Castle.In the old cellars 
 we found lots of interesting artefacts</content>
