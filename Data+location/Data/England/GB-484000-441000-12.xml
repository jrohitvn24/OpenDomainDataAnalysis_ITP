		<content> Market Weighton and Shiptonthorpe are 
 situated in the Old East Riding of    
 Yorkshire which has since been renamed
 as the County of Humberside.  Both    
 towns are increasing in size and      
 population, which bring a variety of  
 different regional accents.  However, 
 these accents are beginning to thicken
 and change as time goes by.  The      
 people who have lived in Yorkshire for
 many years have strong East Yorkshire 
 accents, but with the increasing      
 number of newcomers, the original     
 accent is gradually becoming          
 contaminated.                         
 Examples of typical Yorkshire phrases 
 used locally are: "nowt" instead      
 of"nothing", "owt" instead of         
 "anything", and "I aren't" instead of 
 "I am not".  And the future?  The     
 original Yorkshire accent will        
 disappear as less people speak it.    </content>
