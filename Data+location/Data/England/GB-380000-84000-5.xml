		<content> The heath was renamed'Egdon Heath'by  
 the novelist Thomas Hardy,and used as 
 a setting in his novel'The Return of  
 the Native'.Gustav Holst visited Hardy
 and was so impressed by the heath that
 he composed a piece of music that he  
 named 'Egdon Heath'.                  
 Nestling at the edge of the heath is  
 the hamlet of East Knighton.It        
 consists of groups of houses grouped  
 along mainly unmade up roads.Several  
 of these are thatched and the thatcher
 has been busy this Summer.The'Rising  
 Sun Inn'stands on the village green,it
 serves Bar Meals.                     
 The 'Rainbow Garage'stands on the main
 road.People can remember when it was a
 'Smithy',the first petrol pump was    
 installed in 1923.It now services cars
 Nearby at Knoll Cottage there is a    
 residential caravan site,and Wynards  
 Farm has holiday caravans.            </content>
