		<title>14A 9th BIRTHDAY IN CHURCHDOWN</title>
		<content>  My 9th Birthday was on July 6th 1985.
 I had lots of presents,they were a    
 snooker table,some "Star Wars"figures,
 a tennis racquet,tennis ball and a    
 shuttle-cock.I had a party at Winston 
 Road Sports Hall.We had to wear       
 training shoes so that we didn't      
 damage the surface of the floor.The   
 party started at 3:00p.m. and finished
 at 5:30p.m..                          
  We played girls v boys football and  
 netball.We also played"Kingball":one  
 person from each team stands on a     
 bench.The ball is then thrown to the  
 person on the bench who is joined by a
 team-mate until the whole team is on  
 the bench.                            
  We went home and had beefburgers and 
 rolls for tea.I had a Birthday cake in
 the shape of a cricket pitch with     
 fielders on it.I had a lovely day.
