		<title>10The Future of Maiden Castle</title>
		<content>   Owned by the Duchy of Cornwall,     
 Maiden Castle has recently been placed
 under the protection of English       
 Heritage, whose job it is to preserve,
 manage and promote public interest in,
 Englands historic buildings and       
 monuments. English Heritage wish to   
 bring Maiden Castle before a wider    
 audience as well as protecting it from
 further erosion.At present,in co-     
 operation with the Prince of Wales    
 Trust, there is a scheme for further  
 excavation and for repair to damaged  
 ramparts. The repair work is to be    
 done by deprived young people, paid   
 for by the Prince's Trust and the     
 excavation will interest the          
 International Conference of           
 Archaeology at Southampton in 1986.   
 English  Heritage wish to develop land
 aroud the monument for an             
 Interpretation Centre.                </content>
