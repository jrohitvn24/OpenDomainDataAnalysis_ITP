		<title>13My hobbies - dancing and gym</title>
		<content> My hobby is Tap dancing and           
 gymnastics.  It is good fun.  I do an 
 hour of gym and an hour of tap every  
 Friday from 4pm to 6pm.  We do a      
 show every 2 years.  There are about  
 200 people in the show.  A lady and   
 her sister teach every one of them.   
 The age ranges from about 3 to 40     
 year.  It costs Â£20 a term.  I am     
 taught at Hampton Magna Community     
 Centre with my sister and 13 other    
 girls.  We usually wear black leotards
 and some wear black tights with no    
 feet.  We are now going to wear red   
 leotards because of our last show when
 we wore red leotards for some of the  
 dances.  Our dancing teacher didn't   
 like black leotards.  I like my hobby 
 because you do dances and I like      
 performing in front of people.
