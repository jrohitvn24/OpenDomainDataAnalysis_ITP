		<title>12LIFE AS AN IMMIGRANT</title>
		<content>{*** Interviewed by local children *** 
      This Asian family (man,wife and 2
 year old daughter) had recently moved 
 to England from Australia, where the  
 man had found difficulty in obtaining 
 work in engineering, due to a bias    
 towards native Australians.           
      The family had no complaint about
 the house and found the neighbours to 
 be friendly and helpful. They did not 
 like the amount of broken glass in the
 streets, nor the lack of phone boxes  
 (they had had their own phone fitted  
 to keep family contacts).             
      They did not find the local shops
 attractive or suiting their needs and 
 they did not use the bus services     
 because they had their own car. They  
 found the neighbourhood to be quiet   
 and traffic free (just as they liked  
 it) and were quite happy and well     
 settled in the area.                  </content>
