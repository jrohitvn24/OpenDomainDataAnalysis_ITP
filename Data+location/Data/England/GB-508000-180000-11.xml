		<title>11YEADING WOMEN'S INSTITUTE</title>
		<content>  The meetings are held on the second  
 Friday of the month in St.Edmunds     
 Church at 7.30 pm. The institute      
 members elect a President and         
 Committee of twelve annually. The     
 first part of the monthly meeting is  
 devoted to the business of the        
 institute. At each meeting a speaker  
 is booked, and their subjects are     
 varied to give members an insight into
 a wide variety of subjects. Each year 
 a produce show is held when members   
 display their handicrafts. These      
 include knitting, tapestry, toy making
 and garden produce. Classes are held  
 during the year for the various forms 
 of handicraft. Members support local  
 organisations such as St. Bernards    
 Hospital and League of friends at     
 Hillingdon Hospital. They also take   
 part in the Hillingdon half marathon. 
 Outings are arranged to radio shows.  </content>
