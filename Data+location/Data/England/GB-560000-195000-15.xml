		<title>15Arnold's Wood,Hutton</title>
		<content>  We set off at 11.45 for one of our   
 visits.We walked and walked and tried 
 our best to keep up with our teacher  
 but his stride is three of mine. As we
 got near the railway the stinging     
 nettles got quite out of hand.Every   
 time one stung,you  cried ouch and    
 stumbled. We were going to look       
 at,amongst other things,Arnolds Wood  
 which is behind the housing estate.   
  Some farmers wanted to fell just over
 2.5 acres and so reduce the problems  
 of crops shading and discourage       
 vandalism.Essex County Council said   
 this could not be allowed because the 
 10 acre woodland might date back to   
 the Ice Age.                          
  The Council did say that the wood    
 could be coppiced over a maximum of   
 four seasons.This is good management  
 for without coppicing,plants and      
 animals would die.                    </content>
