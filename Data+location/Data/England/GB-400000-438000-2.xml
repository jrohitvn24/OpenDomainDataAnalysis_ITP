		<title>02THIS YEAR'S WEATHER.</title>
		<content> The weather in this area is heavily   
 influenced by the Pennines. It has    
 been shown that rain systems tend to  
 break up as they cross the Pennines   
 however Keighley still gets above     
 average average rainfall for this     
 area.In{1984}the highest temperature  
 recorded was {28'C.}The summer was hot
 and dry causing some worries over the 
 water supply for parts of the area.   
 Overall though a very wet autumn and  
 winter ensured that the year's total  
 rainfall was above average.The lowest 
 temperature of the winter{1984/5}was  
{-8'C}recorded in February.The summer  
 of {1985}has been extremely wet and   
 dull with only one full week of summer
 weather.The average temperature for   
 June is normally about{20'C,}this year
 it was only{16.9'C}with a low of just{
{9.5'C! }
