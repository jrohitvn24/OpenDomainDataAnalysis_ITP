 Chipperfield,{Jeffrey's Farm}is       
 about 200 years old.  It used to      
 belong to the ancesters of ex US      
 President Jimmy Carter. The farmhouse 
 itself is 400 years old. The present  
 owners are not farmers but in future  
 years might consider putting the land 
 to agricultural use again. This year  
 they are growing a hay crop and       
 planting trees.  The only animals they
 have are domestic pets. The land is   
 used for cottage gardening.

 garden tools.
