		<title>10ASTLEY PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church was rebuilt in 1343 at the 
 expense of Thomas de Astley.It was a  
 cruciform building with a central     
 tower and spire and was known as the  
 "Lanthern of Arden" as travellers     
 could pick out a light hung on the    
 spire to guide them.The church was    
 also to be a college for several      
 priests and these buildings were to   
 the north east of the present church  
 site.                                 
     After the Dissolution of church   
 colleges the property at Astley       
 reverted to the current lords of the  
 manor and Adrian Stokes plundered the 
 buildings for materials including     
 demolishing the spire and stripping   
 the lead form the roof in 1558.
