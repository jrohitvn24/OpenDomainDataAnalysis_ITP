		<title>13PLAYING OUT AT HORNBY</title>
		<content> In Hornby there  are lots of different
 places we play in. One is a bridge    
 over a beck. There are lots of trees  
 round the beck. We enjoy trying to get
 across without using the bridge. There
 is also a tree in one field which has 
 a branch that is bouncy we have rides 
 on it we call it the  Bouncy Branch.  
 When we play cricket. We play it in   
 Park Chase. We sometimes make secret  
 dens. Sometimes we play hide and seek.
 In winter we find ice ponds and play  
 Eskimos trying to catch seals. We get 
 sticks and smash the ice. Sometimes we
 collect ladybirds and put them on     
 slates.
