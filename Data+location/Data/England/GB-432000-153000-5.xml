		<content>  The area has the normal services, but
 on a restricted basis. The milkman, eg
 delivers every other day.             
  Other services include a daily paper 
 delivery service, where the papers are
 delivered by car to the villages and  
 distributed within by paper boys. The 
 sunday papers are delivered by car by 
 a private individual.                 
  The postal service includes a daily  
 delivery service and a twice daily    
 collection service.                   
  There is a bread and greengrocer     
 delivery service available but these  
 tend to be restricted and expensive.  
  The villages of Upton and Vernham    
 Dean each possess a general store,    
 with the Upton store providing a very 
 good service that compares pricewise  
 with the supermarkets of Andover and a
 range that extends from computers to  
 spirits.                              </content>
