		<title>13The ecology of Cowlinge</title>
		<content>                                       
This area is mainly open farland,      
consisting of large fields separated by
unmanaged hedgerows.There are a few    
copses which are used for pheasant     
rearing, and during the winter months  
some organised 'shoots' take place. The
river Kennet rises at Hobbles Green and
runs fed by drainage ditches through   
Cowlinge. Although this is possibly    
polluted by chemicals washed from the  
fields it contains frogs, toads and    
newts. The river Sioh runs through     
Little Bradley and contains trout etc. 
Most footpaths in the area are disused,
only a few including a bridle path     
between Cowlinge and Lt. Bradley are   
used regularly.A cold wet spring       
followed a sever winter with hard      
frosts and snowfall,a cool wet summer  
has caused much vegetation and new     
life.                                  </content>
