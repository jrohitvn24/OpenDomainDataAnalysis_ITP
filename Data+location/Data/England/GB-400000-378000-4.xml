		<content> They have a garden of about an acre   
 next to a large field,on the other    
 side is a rough sloping carpark which 
 always overflows on Sundays.The       
 rectory is opposite the church.       
               When Samuel  Evans was  
 rector at Taxal,  Colonel Hall came to
 church .The two men had a fight.When  
 the fight was over the Colonel said he
 would never come to Taxal Church again
 so he had Trinity Church built in     
 1904.Trinity church has no tower      
 and no pews,it has wooden chairs      
 linked together .It only has one      
 stained glass window at the end. On   
 the walls are two carved murals.One   
 depicting the birth of Jesus and one  
 depicting his return in the Garden.
