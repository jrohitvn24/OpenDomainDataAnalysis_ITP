		<title>13Worksop Bypass</title>
		<content>     At present a bypass is being      
 constructed which, when complete, will
 run from the S of Manton and then     
 swing NW around the W edge of Worksop.
 It will be part of the A57 trunk road 
 and will indirectly link the A1 with  
 the M1.                               
     It is being built to relieve      
 congestion in Worksop town centre.    
 Even with a one_way system enforced in
 some areas of the town centre the     
 roads are having difficulty in coping 
 with the large amount of surplus      
 traffic which will be directed around 
 the town via the faster dual/single   
 carriageway road.                     
     However, there were several       
 factors in opposition to the          
 construction as well. The flat land   
 ideal for the highway is, in some     
 areas, valuable agricultural land,    
 thus affecting local farming.         </content>
