		<title>01Mousehole and Lamorna</title>
		<content>    Mousehole and a part of Lamorna    
 both lie in Paul Church Parish but the
 church is just in the block to the    
 north.  Both of these areas are on the
 coastline and are very picturesque and
 Lamorna has a beautiful wooded valley 
 stretching in from the cove.          
    The two main industries of the area
 are{tourism,}particularly in the      
 coastal area, and{farming}inland. At  
 one time Mousehole was a purely       
 fishing village with quaint narrow    
 streets of cottages.  Today many of   
 those cottages are used for holiday   
 letting or in some instances for      
 second homes, and most of the boats in
 the harbour are used for{recreational}
 pursuits which also includes some     
 fishing.                              
    Throughout the area there are many 
 artist studios, potteries and craft   
 workshops which cater for the tourist.</content>
