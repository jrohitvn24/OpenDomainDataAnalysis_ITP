		<title>17BERRYNARBORS GREAT FIRE</title>
		<content>   In the centre of Berrynarbor Village
 almost opposithe the church steps is a
 guest house known now az Bessemer     
 Thatch. It was originally three       
 cottages and one of the owneers was   
 called Bess Emery..this is wher the   
 name comes from. The original cottages
 were thatched but a spark from a      
 chimney caught the thatch on fire and 
 burned the roof of the cottges and the
 top floors.Also involved in the fire  
 was the house next door which used to 
 be the forge. The fire brigade from   
 Ilfracombe arrived but this was in    
 the mid 1930's and the fire was well  
 under  way when they arrived. During  
 the following threedays the village   
 school was closed because the Head    
 Mistress of the school lived at the   
 Old Forge.
