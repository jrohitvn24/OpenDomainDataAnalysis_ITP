		<title>11The Butchers Shop</title>
		<content> My Dad works at a butcher's shop and  
 he sells meat and there is a donkey at
 the back of the shop and he sells     
 sausages as well and I help him make  
 the sausages. Sometimes he brings the 
 sausages home so we can have them for 
 our dinner and tea. Sometimes we have 
 them for breakfast and the donkey     
 behind the shop is called Humperdink. 
   We are selling the shop for Â£10.000 
 and the house for Â£7.000 and if they  
 want both of them they can have them  
 for Â£17.000.
