		<title>08RANBY VILLAGE CHURCH</title>
		<content>    The village, that lies mainly in   
 the block, was from its settlement    
 (probably in Danish times), dependent 
 on Babworth. The parish church there  
 was used by its inhabitants throughout
 the centuries, until a chapel of ease 
 was built in 1898. This was replaced  
 by a new church in 1960.
