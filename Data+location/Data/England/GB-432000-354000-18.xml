		<title>18BEATING THE BOUNDS</title>
		<content> In Roman times boundary marker stones 
 were introduced to separate different 
 pieces of land.From that time Parish  
 boundaries have become increasingly   
 important and the custom developed of 
 "Beating" the bounds when people were 
 actually"beaten,bumped or whipped"on  
 the boundary stones to impress upon   
 them where the actual boundary was.   
 Last year(1984)it was 21 years since  
 the W.E.A.Crich branch began and 1984 
 was also Crich Junior School Centenary
 so the two organisations unite to     
 "Beat the bounds"of Crich.            
 Girl 1.                               
 When we "Beat the bounds",we "beat" a 
 boy with a twig at Parkhead,just      
 before you go down the lane to Hilltop
 Farm.We only did it lightly.We went on
 to a farm where the lady kept a       
 peacock called Percy.She gave everyone
 a beautiful feather.                  </content>
