		<title>17Kimbolton - Amenities</title>
		<content> For a smallish community the most     
 significant amenity must be the wide  
 range of shops,followed by the 3      
 doctor medical practice,the dentist's 
 surgery,the bank and the Post         
 Office.The most historic amenity is   
 the volunteer{Fire Service}first      
 established in 1763.Kimbolton has 3   
 halls.The{Mandeville Hall}is used     
 for village meetings,dances,whist     
 drives.The{converted Baptist Church}is
 used for Youth Club meetings and      
 elections.The{Lewis Hall}can seat     
 600 and is used for large scale       
 functions.Kimbolton School owns this  
 hall but encourages village use of    
 it,when feasible,to promote good will.
 For the same reason other school      
 facilities are available:the 22 rifle 
 range,the swimming-pool,the tennis    
 courts and even the State rooms of the
 Castle for important occasions.       </content>
