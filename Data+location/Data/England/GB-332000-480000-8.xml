		<content>  {Roudsea Wood}is named after a Viking
 chief and there has been woodland on  
 the site for over 1000 years.The main 
 use of the wood has been for{         
{coppicing}- the regular cutting of    
 trees and bushes.A lot of coppiced    
 wood was burnt in the vicinity to make
{charcoal.}This was then taken by horse
 drawn railway to the{gunpowder factory
 at nearby Low Wood.Barrels made from  
 local wood were used to transport the 
 gunpowder to ships which sailed up the
 estuary.Charcoal was also used to     
 smelt iron.Roudsea provided wood for{ 
{clog soles}and{bobbins}for the cotton 
 industries of Lancashire.Bark from the
 trees was used to{tan leather}and{soap
 was made from the ashes of waste wood 
 which was burnt in pitsteads.Nothing  
 was wasted.                           
   Charcoal burners' and tan barkers'  
 huts and pitsteads are visible today. </content>
