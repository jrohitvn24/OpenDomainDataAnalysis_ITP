history of non-conformity in religious 
faith and worship. In past years both  
the Methodist tradition and the        
Baptists were very strong. Today there 
are a wide number of Christian         
denominations including Roman Catholics
Anglicans,Baptists,Methodists,and      
Presbyterians.

development of Christianity in         
Northampton include Philip Doddridge   
(1702-1751)who founded the Castle Hill 
Chapel,John Wesley who made no less    
than twenty-four visits to Northampton 
between 1741 and 1790, and William     
Carey all of whom made a lasting       
impression on the town.
