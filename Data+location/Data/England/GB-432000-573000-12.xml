		<title>12 ST.MARYS OR BATES ISLAND.</title>
		<content>Its first recorded owner was T.Bates   
surveyor to Elizabeth 1.In 1573 it was 
named Bates Island or Hill.It is a     
small crop of sandstone belonging to   
the coal measures of the carbonifeous  
period and was originally joined to the
mainland.Erosion by the sea has turned 
it into an island at high tide.        
  In medieval times a chapel dedicated 
to ST.HELEN stood on the island        
together with a cemetry where shipwreck
victims were buried.The last traces of 
the chapel were lost when the          
lighthouse was built between 1896-1898 
after which the island was mistakenly  
named ST.MARY'S.In 1855 George Ewen,a  
fisherman built a cottage and in 1862  
it was converted to a pub called "THE  
SQUARE AND COMPASS".Trinity house who  
now own the Lighthouse and two houses  
are selling them.The pub is now a cafe 
and gift shop.                         </content>
