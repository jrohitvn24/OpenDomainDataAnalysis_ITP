		<content> Interviews were conducted with local  
 farmers, a gamekeeper and two         
 ornithologists.There is evidence for a
 variety of{mammals}living in the      
 arable lands of the 12km block.       
{Rabbits}are very common. They breed   
 rapidly and are more evident than     
{hares,}although the{rabbits}do get    
 myxomatosis.There are few{grey        
{squirrels}and no evidence for{red     
{squirrels,}as the area is not         
 wooded.Badgers have sets at two sites 
 near the village of Kersall and at    
 Hare Hill, but just outside the "D"   
 block. These are registered sets.Foxes
 were increasing in numbers with about 
 20 known in the locality.Other common 
 mammals include{weasels}and{stoats.
