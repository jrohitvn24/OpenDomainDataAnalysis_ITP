		<content> A sprayer is carried by a tractor,    
 sprays water and chemicals on the     
 crops to kill the weeds.  A nodee is  
 carried by a tractor and can  be used 
 to sow seed, but more often is used   
 for top dressing and putting          
 fertiliser on the growing crops.      
 Trailers are used for carrying heavy  
 goods or the crop after it has been   
 harvested.  Sugar beet machines are   
 rarely used by farmers as the refinery
 at Felsted has closed down.  Sugar    
 beet harvesters lift the ripe sugar   
 beet, cuts the leaves off and throws  
 the beet into a trailer.
