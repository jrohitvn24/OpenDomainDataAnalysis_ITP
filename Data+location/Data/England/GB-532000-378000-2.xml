		<title>02SHEEP-SHEARING</title>
		<content>      On Wednesday 19th June we went to
 watch  the  sheep shearing on one     
 of the nearby farms.  They have 1200  
 sheep  altogether. They shear         
 their tummy first then their legs.    
 Then they turn  them over and put     
 their leg over their head.It takes    
 3mins. 5 seconds.  The young sheep    
 weigh 70 to 80 pounds.  They roll the 
 fleece up into a bundle and take the  
 dirty bits off.  They shear 120 sheep 
 in a morning.  All the sheep which    
 have had lambs have red marks on them.
 Each fleece weighs 8 to 10 lbs. and is
 worth about Â£4.00.                    
      A gang of four men come to shear 
 the sheep helped by three of the      
 regular farm workers and three        
 sheepdogs.                            
      It is one of the few farms in the
 area which still practises mixed      
 farming.                              </content>
