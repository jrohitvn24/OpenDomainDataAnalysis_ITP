		<title>07River Coquet at Acklington</title>
		<content> The{River Coquet}is surely one of the 
 prettiest rivers in England. It begins
 in the Cheviot Hills and it flows into
 the sea at Amble. It is a well known  
 salmon river and fishing is a popular 
 sport on the stretch of river beside  
 Acklington. Birds using the river     
 include kingfishers, herons, ducks and
 swans (we even had a pelican for a    
 while) and small mammals such as voles
 and water rats are very common. Otters
 used to be common but mink are more   
 numerous now.{Acklington Dam}was built
 in 1778 to provide water for a tin &amp;  
 iron foundry which opened in 1775.    
 Some people claim that the dam drove  
 the salmon out of the Coquet and so a 
 fish ladder was built beside the dam. 
 The foundry became a woollen mill in  
 1791 and then a dye factory in 1916.  
 Today the "Dye House" is in fact a    
 group of four private dwellings.      </content>
