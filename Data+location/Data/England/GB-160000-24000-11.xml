		<title>11METHLEIGH FARM</title>
		<content>    Methleigh Farm was built before    
 1066 and was in the original Domesday 
 Book. Before the Norman Conquest it   
 was owned by the Bishop of Exeter.    
 After the conquest it was given to    
 Robert of Normandy.                   
    The present tenant is a man called 
 Mr.Dawson from St.Austell. They employ
 two people, one part time, the other  
 full time. They own about twenty      
 fields which adds up to about eighty  
 acres. The main land use is crops.    
 They use modern methods of farming and
 have about five tractors. They also   
 have five riding horses plus a family 
 cow and calf.
