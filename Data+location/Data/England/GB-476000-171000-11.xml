 WOODLEY IS A VERY FLAT AREA WITHOUT   
 MANY HILLS.                           
   THE SOIL IS MAINLY CLAY,SAND AND    
 GRAVEL.MUCH OF THE GRAVEL HAS BEEN    
 EXCAVATED FOR BUILDING MOTORWAYS.THE  
 HOLES THAT ARE LEFT HAVE FORMED LAKES.
{DINTON PASTURES}USED TO BE ALL GRAVEL 
 PITS.                                 
   WOODLEY IS FAMOUS FOR ONE THING.IT  
 IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THE{LODDON    
{LILLY}GROWS.IT GROWS BY THE RIVER     
 LODDON.THE LODDON AND THE MOTORWAY    
 BOTH CUT WOODLEY IN HALF.             
   HALF OF WOODLEY IS HOUSES AND HALF  
 IS FARMLAND.THERE ARE EIGHT FARMS IN  
 OUR AREA.
