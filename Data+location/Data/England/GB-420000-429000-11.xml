		<title>11OLD DUKE WILLIAM INN,TONG.</title>
		<content>   We interviewed the landlord  and his
 wife of the Old Duke William public   
 house which is an l80 year old        
 building situated on the busy A 650   
 road three miles from Bradford.  About
 ten years ago the extensive stabling  
 was pulled down to make a car park.   
   The customers are a mixture of      
 middle and working class; only about  
 l5% live within walking distance, the 
 majority live within ten miles and    
 travel by car.  Some long distance    
 lorry drivers who deliver goods to the
 nearby industrial estate have their   
 meals in the inn and sleep in their   
 purpose built cabs in the car park.   
   The inn offers the usual services,  
 being open for intoxicating drinks    
 twice daily, seven days a week.  The  
 most popular drinks are beer and      
 lager although cider and wine are     
 drunk by the younger customers.       </content>
