		<content>  Traditionally, Bakewell's main source
 of  employment has  been  agriculture.
 Lead mining was also a reliable source
 of  employment  in  the area  for many
 years.  Many people, especially women,
 came from surrounding villages to work
 in Bakewell.  If a child  was orphaned
 or its parents  were unable to provide
 for  it,   compulsory   apprenticeship
 would take place. Girls would be taken
 into domestic service  and  boys would
 often go  into trade  in Sheffield  or
 local agriculture.   In  recent years,
 many new occupations have developed in
 service  industries  such as plumbing,
 electrical   contractors,    builders,
 garages  and  agricultural   services.
 Today's  population  is  very  much  a
 commuter  population,   travelling  to
 work  in  nearby  centres of commerce,
 such as Sheffield, Matlock or Derby.
