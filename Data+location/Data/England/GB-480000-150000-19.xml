		<content> In  Linkway the female hairdresser    
 has been there for 12 years, before   
 that there was another hairdressers   
 shop. The boss is called Brenda Rook, 
 she chose that shop because she likes 
 hairdressing. We found that the most  
 popular hairstyle was a bob,because as
 it was short it was cool. Whilst you  
 were having your hair done you were   
 asked if you wanted a cup of coffee   
 which was 40p.The staff had to bring  
 their own hairdrier.CHARGES, Wet trims
 were Â£3.50, dry Â£2.50.,cut and blow   
 dry Â£8 .60.The  busiest day is Friday,
 (Record, 56 customers once).The shop  
 is open at                            
 9,00am to 5.30pm on Fridays, 9.00am to
 7.00pm all other days ,except Sundays 
 when it is closed. There are 12 people
 working there and an hour is taken off
 for dinner.                           
                                       </content>
