		<title>01AROUND OUTWOOD SURREY</title>
		<content> Outwood is the main point of interest 
 in this area as a village. It has a   
 post office, a pub, butcher and church
 most noteable the oldest working      
 windmill. The poulation is just over  
 300 and large areas of outwood are    
 National Trust. The surrounding area  
 is farmland, some cultivated fields   
 and others enclosed for rough grazing.
 the village of Horne is included in   
 this area consists of mostly farmland,
 but a small amount of manufacturing   
 works. Transport consists of a Post   
 Bus through Outwood. People living    
 here either work on the farms, a few  
 in industry and many work out of the  
 area. Schools in this area have now   
 closed, and children travel out to    
 them.
