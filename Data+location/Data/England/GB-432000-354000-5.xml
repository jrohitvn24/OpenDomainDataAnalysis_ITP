 When I am ill my mum rings up the     
 doctor's surgery to make an           
 appointment for as soon as possible   
 and she gets me ready for whenever the
 appointment is. The surgery is on     
 Dimple Lane. When you get there you   
 have to wait for a while and then the 
 person who has been in will come out  
 and a buzzer will tell the            
 receptionist, Miss Haslam, to call the
 next patient and she will call out my 
 name. Dr Twist or Dr Macarthur or Dr  
 Shearer sees me and gives me a        
 prescription for pills or antibiotics.
 Mum takes it to the chemist on the    
 Market Place. The assistant goes into 
 the back room and a few minutes later 
 she comes back with my medicine or    
 pills.I don't have to pay because I am
 under sixteen.                        
                                       </content>
