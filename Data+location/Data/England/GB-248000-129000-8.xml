 My bike is light blue in colour. It is
 a girls' bike which means that it has 
 not got a crossbar between the saddle 
 and the handlebars. It has got two 28"
 wheels, the back wheel being connected
 by a chain to two pedals. On the      
 handlebars there are two brake levers,
 one for each wheel. It also has a     
 bell. Some bikes have a basket or a   
 saddlebag but mine hasn't. It has     
 three gears and the lever to work     
 these is also on the handlebars. Most 
 boys I know have bikes called BMX     
 bikes which are designed for riding   
 over rough ground and for performing  
 tricks but I prefer my bike for riding
 along the roads.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
