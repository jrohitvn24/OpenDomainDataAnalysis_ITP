		<title>16EMPLOYMENT IN NEWBIGGIN HALL</title>
		<content>  We asked 100 children in our school  
 questions about their{parents'        
{employment.}63 fathers and 60 mothers 
 were in employment . 44 of the        
 mothers we classed as being in part-  
 time employment as they worked for    
 less than 4 hours per day. These      
 part-time jobs included cleaners (23) 
 and dinner-ladies (8). 14 of the      
 mothers in full-time employment were  
 shop assistants.                      
  Only 8 of the fathers were employed  
 in the manufacturing industries while 
 the remainder were involved in service
 industries. 2 fathers were employed on
 oil rigs in the North Sea. Most of the
 fathers worked in jobs away from the  
 estate,whereas most of the mothers    
 worked within walking distance of     
 their homes.
