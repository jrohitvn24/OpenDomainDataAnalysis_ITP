 popular for shopping in Nottingham,to 
 go to school and work, and for        
 pleasure.At school we use a bus once a
 week to travel to the swimming pool at
 keyworth.A service bus runs about five
 times a day from Nottingham to        
 Leicester and transports village      
 children to and from the comprehensive
 school in Keyworth.
