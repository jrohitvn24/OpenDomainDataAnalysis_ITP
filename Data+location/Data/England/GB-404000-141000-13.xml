 societies in Shrewton and Orcheston,  
 many of which are supported generously
 by local residents and outsiders.     
   Shrewton Silver Band is one such    
 organisation. The village has had a   
 brass band for many years, and each   
 year they participate in fetes,       
 carnivals and contests. They also     
 organise fund-raising events such as  
 jumble sales and giving concerts.     
   The Womans Institute is also a      
 thriving group in the village.The     
 members enjoy competitions,sports     
 tournaments, and listening to outside 
 speakers on a variety of subjects.    
   Many groups are involved in         
 charitable projects helping less      
 fortunate people in foreign countries,
 for example,Group '81 provide funds to
 educate a young child in Nepal.
