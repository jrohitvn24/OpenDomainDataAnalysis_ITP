		<title>04A Dairy Farm in Taddington</title>
		<content>    My grandad's dairy farm is at least
 500 years old.At one time part of the 
 barn at the side of the house was used
 as a chapel.It is really three farms  
 in one and covers 150 acres. He has   
 about fifty milking Friesian cows and 
 a lot of growing calves and heifers.  
 The main crop is grass which is cut in
 summer for silage and three fields of 
 hay for the young calves.Straw is     
 bought as bedding for the winter when 
 the animals are kept inside.In the    
 late Spring,the animals are let out   
 into the fields until the Autumn. The 
 cows are milked twice a day -early    
 morning and evening.My grandad and dad
 use various tractors for the many     
 different jobs such as cleaning out   
 the buildings,spreading slurry,carting
 water to the animals in the fields as 
 well as many more besides the busy    
 time of silaging,haymaking and baling.</content>
