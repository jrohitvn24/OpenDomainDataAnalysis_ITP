		<content>        The original town of Yarm is   
 situated  in  a  loop  of  the  River 
 Tees.It is an old market town and has 
 been a settlement since the Iron-Age. 
     There is also a lot of evidence   
 connecting  Yarm  to  its  Norman past
 including a reference in the Domesday 
 Book.                                 
    Much of the  present  High  Street 
 was built during the Middle Ages when 
 Yarm was a thriving port.Stockton then
 Middlesbrough had taken over that     
 role but not before some of Yarm's    
 business men made their mark on the   
 industrial revolution.Their important 
 contribution to the establishment of  
 the railways is well known.           
                           Today Yarm  
 is an attractive shopping centre and a
 rapidly expanding dormitory town for  
 the nearby industrial centres.
