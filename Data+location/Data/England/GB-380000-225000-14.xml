		<title>14LAW AND ORDER:ASHLEWORTH</title>
		<content> Our local policeman is based at       
 Staunton and he is responsible for{law
{and order}in eight {parishes}.For his 
 job he sometimes goes to accidents or 
 questions people who might have seen  
 them occur.He drives a motorbike and  
 he has a radio on the back to tell him
 if there has been an accident or if he
 is needed elsewhere.His work involves 
 going to schools and talking to       
 children and also taking them for     
 cycling proficiency lessons.He is very
 busy and sometimes he has days off.   
 Then you must contact another station 
 or you can leave a message on an      
 answering machine if it is not that   
 important.Our policeman said that     
 there is very little {vandalism}in our
 area but traffic offences keep him    
 busy.We like to think that our {      
{Village Policeman}is our friend.
