		<title>15SOUTH LEVERTON</title>
		<content> South Leverton is a village to the    
 north of the survey area.Its sister   
 village of North Leverton with        
 Habblesthorpe lies further on.        
    South Leverton is very much a      
 separate community to the villages    
 already described.Children go to      
 school at North Leverton and          
 generally, there is little to link the
 two regions of the area.              
     Some housing development has taken
 place in the village but people have  
 to travel out of the village to       
 work.Many people will be employed at  
 Rampton Hospital, or one of the       
 Trentside power stations.Recently a   
 private nursing home has opened in the
 village.There are several farms in the
 area, and the village is surrounded by
 open fields.
