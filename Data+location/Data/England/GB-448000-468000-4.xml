 I start by milking the goats,feeding  
 them,the hens and geese and letting   
 them out to graze.I bottle goats milk 
 and put it to cool.I feed the         
 children,take them to school and      
 deliver the milk.My husband will have 
 finished milking the cows.I supply his
 breakfast,wash the pots,tidy up and   
 make lunch.In the afternoon I may help
 with the hay,silage or harvest.I may  
 have to help with anything from taking
 a tractor to pieces to calving a      
 cow.Next I bring the children home and
 do the dinner.I milk the goats,feed   
 the animals and collect and wash the  
 eggs.The rest of the evening is more  
 or less my own.My favourite pastimes  
 are gardening in summer and knitting  
 in winter.
