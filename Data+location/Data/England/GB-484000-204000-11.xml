 In 1892 the railway was extended from 
 Chalfont to Wendover thus bringing the
 first tourists to the area. There are 
 many beautiful walks to enjoy         
 including the Ridgeway Path and the   
 Inknield Way. Coombe Hill 848ft above 
 sea_level, is dedicated as a National 
 Nature Reserve and is the site of     
 Britain's first public nature trail.  
 The dome of St Paul's Cathedral can be
 seen on a clear day from the summit.  
 Annualy a Cross Country Race is held  
 from Wendover village to the top of   
 Coombe Hill and back, attracting many 
 spectators. The Prime Minister's      
 residence of Chequers is nearby and is
 a 'must' for tourists, although not   
 open to the public. Horse Trials at   
 Russell Farm occasionaly have royal   
 entrants and are well supported.
