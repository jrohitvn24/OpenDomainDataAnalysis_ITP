		<title>16SESSAY - ARTS AND CRAFTS</title>
		<content> There is a very lively interest in all
 manner of{arts and crafts}in Sessay.  
 Many of the women knit and sew, but we
 have one or two outstanding embroider-
 esses.  Living in such lovely scenery 
 has encouraged artists to paint and   
 photograph, and one man makes wrought 
 iron and carves in wood.  Some of the 
 old{country crafts}are still practised
 - corn dollies, spinning and weaving: 
 one spinner makes the lovely spinning 
 wheels.  Crafts taught at the village 
{evening class}are legion and include  
 upholstery, soft furnishing, quilting,
 patchwork, and pewter work.  Naturally
 we have a{village show}where all these
 crafts can be exhibited along with    
 garden produce and flowers and the    
 work of the flower arrangers. The     
{Drama Group}puts on two shows a year  
 which have become a part of the       
 village life.                         </content>
