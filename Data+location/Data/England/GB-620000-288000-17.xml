		<content> The 17th century house was built on   
 the site of a 15th century hall &amp; is  
 surrounded by 60 acres of wooded      
 parkland,where sheep graze.The        
 farmland was recently sold.Nearby is  
 the Great Barn,a large 3 bay early    
 17th century building built of red    
 brick from the old manor &amp; in good    
 condition providing storage.The       
 Courthouse,a 16th century timber      
 framed building, now needs repair.    
 These are all listed Grade 2.A deep   
 brick walled moat surrounds the house 
 with water in most parts.The site of  
 the original house was the Dark Park,a
 field distant, marked by a strip of   
 moat &amp; trees in parkland. Elizabeth 1,
 as an infant was hidden after her     
 mother's execution by her great aunt  
 Lady Shelton at the Hall.
