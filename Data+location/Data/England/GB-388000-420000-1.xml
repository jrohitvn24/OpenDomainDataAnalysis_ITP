		<title>01Shawforth - Introduction</title>
		<content>   Shawforth is a part of the Township 
 of Whitworth and nestles in a valley  
 five miles north of Rochdale on the   
 A671 Rochdale to Burnley road.        
   Past industrial quarry and coal     
 mine workings are much in evidence,   
 but once up on the surrounding moors  
 the wild landscape takes on a beauty  
 of its own.                           
   Two miles to the south is Healey    
 Dell Nature Reserve, well worth a     
 visit. The area is well situated      
 for day trips to North Wales, the Lake
 District, the Yorkshire Dales,the Peak
 District and seaside resorts such as  
 Southport, Morecambe and Blackpool.   
 For those who prefer the city scene,  
 Manchester and Liverpool are both     
 within an hour's travelling time,     
 thanks to an extensive motorway system
 close at hand.                        
                                       </content>
