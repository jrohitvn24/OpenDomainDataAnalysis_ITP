		<title>12THE EVENTIDE CLUB, UPHAM</title>
		<content>    The Eventide Club was formed in    
 1951 for ladies aged over 60 and      
 gentlemen aged over 65. Members come  
 from Upham, Bishops Waltham and Fair  
 Oak. They meet on the first and third 
 Thursdays of every month, when there  
 is an interesting talk by a visiting  
 speaker, or games of Skittles and     
 Bingo, or Beetle Drives, or           
 competitions.                         
    Each year they hold a birthday     
 party in October; this year, 1985, the
 Club will celebrate its 34th.birthday.
 There is also a Christmas lunch, a    
 concert by children from Upham School,
 and two half day and one whole day    
 outings.                              
    Membership at present stands at    
 twenty five. Meeting socially helps to
 ward off loneliness and provides      
 an opportunity to give assistance and 
 comfort when it is needed.            </content>
