		<title>09LODGE FARM AND RECTORY FARM</title>
		<content> LODGE FARM 148 acres. This farm is    
 Council rented. The farmer works on   
 his own though has some casual labour.
 The farmhouse is let by the Council as
 the farmer lives in Fulbourn. Among   
 his machines is a split-mould         
 reversible plough used on hard soil,  
 ploughing to a depth of 5-6" . A Dutch
 harrow with straight tines harrows top
 soil and consolidates, to avoid       
 erosion and retain moisture.          
 RECTORY FARM 401 acres. Size of field 
 varies from 16-40 acres. Farm owned by
 the farmer, inherited from his father.
 His spacious brick-built house erected
 in 1981. Two farm labourers live in   
 the cottages at the end of the farm   
 drive. An average price for feed wheat
 is Â£100 per ton, Â£110 for bread making
 wheat. Yields are improving due to    
 more disease-free strains of seed.
