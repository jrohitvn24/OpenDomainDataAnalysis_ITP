		<content> ALTHOUGH WE HAVE QUITE A LOT OF       
FACTORIES IN OUR BLOCK THEY DO NOT SEEM
TO MAKE MUCH POLLUTION AND SOME OF THEM
ARE KEPT CLEAN WITH GRASSLAND AND      
TREES.                                 
LOOKING AROUND OUR AREA WHAT CONCERNS  
US MOST IS THE LITTER AND VANDALISM.THE
LITTER IS NOT AS BAD AS SOME PLACES BUT
THERE IS STILL A LOT ABOUT.VANDALS HAVE
BROKEN SEVERAL PHONE BOXES AND THE     
WINDOWS ON BUS SHELTERS.IN SOME PLACES 
THERE IS SPRAY PAINT ON WALLS.ONE OF   
THE REASONS FOR THIS IS THAT THERE IS  
NOT A LOT TO DO AND CHILDREN GET BORED.
 SOME PARENTS ARE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT   
THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THERE ALWAYS SEEMS 
TO BE RUMOURS THAT SOME WILL HAVE TO   
CLOSE BECAUSE THERE ARE NMOT ENOUGH    
CHILDREN TO FILL THEM.
