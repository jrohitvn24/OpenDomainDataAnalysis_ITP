		<title>09ORAL HISTORY-GIRLS' WORK</title>
		<content> The following 3 pages evolved from an 
 oral history project carried out by a 
 third year class.James interviewed    
 Gertie Henderson and Mrs. Finn.       
                                       
 Girls started work at 13 which was the
 school leaving age before the 2nd     
 World War.Most jobs were poorly paid. 
 Many girls would get about 7s 3d (36p 
 today) weekly.                        
 The working community was a happy     
 one.But many young girls would not    
 keep their first jobs and tried to    
 find a new job.                       
 At home girls would do jobs to earn   
 extra money.Boys and girls would do   
 different jobs at home.But they both  
 had an even chance of getting a job.
