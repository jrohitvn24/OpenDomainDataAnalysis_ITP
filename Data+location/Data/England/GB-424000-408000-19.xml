		<content> My grandma started work at thirteen.  
 She earned a weekly wage of 7/6d (37p)
 working at a mill doing woollen       
 piecing in a mill at Priest Royd      
 Mills. The working hours were:        
       6:30am - 8:30am                 
       9:00am - 12:00am                
      12:45pm - 5:30pm                 
 Washday consisted of soaking whites   
 the night before in a powder called   
 Lovley Polly. Boiled water was taken  
 from the fireside to the tub in an    
 enamel jug. Being lucky to have a tub 
 you then rinsed dry using a mangle.   
 Washing took a full day and ironing   
 took another.                         
         Washing  powder 2d            
         Soda            2d            
 There was no such thing as sliced     
 bread. Families had to bake teir own  
 bread and that was another days job.
