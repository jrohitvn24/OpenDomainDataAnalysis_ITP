		<title>03GLOUCESTER OLD SPOT</title>
		<content> The Gloucester Old Spot is a rare     
 breed of pig with a few black spots   
 and a strange eye. Many of the pigs   
 have won cups and prizes at shows and 
 contests. It is good quality meat and 
 for a time it was virtually extinct.  
 However Graham Brown got hold of some 
 and has bred them successfully. When  
 they get to 4 years old they are      
 slaughtered.                          
 Some of the names of the sows here    
 are:Princess Mary, Star, Princess     
 Joan, Countess, Bluebell, Dolly,      
 Josephine, Muriel, Dahlia, Princess   
 Anne, Ellen, Princess Freda, Primrose,
 Princess, Star Marie and Star         
 Antoinette. They are inter-related and
 Princess Mary gave birth to most sows 
 in January (68) and to most gilts in  
 January (50). Altogether 611 piglets  
 were born in January this year.
