		<content> The house we visited used to be five  
 separate cottages for labourers on    
 Down Farm.They were built about four  
 hundred years ago.An old well in front
 of the house was in use until 20 years
 ago(the water is now pumped to a small
 reservoir and filtered).              
 One room was a shepherd's house.He    
 also cured hams and there are still   
 marks on one wall where the hams used 
 to hang.           {Claire Hearfield. 
                                       
 The Dillay Valley farms once supported
 200 but people have moved out as farms
 have become more mechanised.Many old  
 houses have collapsed but some have   
 become holiday cottages.Now only two  
 households remain.One 'declined farm' 
 has been bought by the Glos.Trust for 
 Nature Conservation because it has    
 never been artificially fertilised.
