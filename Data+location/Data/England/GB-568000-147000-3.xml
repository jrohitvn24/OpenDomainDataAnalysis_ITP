		<content> BRENCHLEY'S SHOP IS JUST OVER 100     
 YEARS OLD. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN MR.  
 BRENCHLEY'S FAMILY. ABOUT 1,000       
 HOP-PICKERS CAME TO IT EVERY YEAR     
 UNTIL ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO. THE SHOP    
 USED TO SELL VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING     
 BECAUSE IT WAS THE MAIN SHOP IN THE   
 VILLAGE. MR. BRENCHLEY DOES NOT SELL  
 SUCH A WIDE RANGE NOW BECAUSE THE     
 VILLAGERS TEND TO SHOP IN SUPERMARKETS
 AT PADDOCK WOOD OR MAIDSTONE.         
 ONCE, THERE WERE NO BUSES RUNNING     
 THROUGH THE VILLAGE SO PEOPLE HAD TO  
 WAIT FOR THE CARRIER TO TAKE THEM INTO
 MAIDSTONE.WHEN THEY WANTED TO COME    
 BACK THEY WAITED FOR IT TO MAKE ITS   
 RETURN JOURNEY TO BRING THEM HOME.ALL 
 THE OLD PEOPLE FROM THE NEARBY ESTATE 
 USED TO GO TO BRENCHLEY'S FOR THEIR   
 FOOD- AND THEY GO THERE STILL.        
                                       
                                       </content>
