		<title>05ARABLE FARMING IN GRAFTON</title>
		<content> We own three hundred acres of arable  
 farm land. The crops we grow are      
 wheat, barley, field beans and oilseed
 rape. Oilseed rape is used for        
 margarine, cooking oil and animal     
 feed. It has a long green stalk with a
 yellow flower on top. grows to about  
 one and a half metres tall. It is     
 harvested at the end of July, our     
 busiest month because we are gathering
 the wheat and barley. We use a combine
 harvester,two tractors and two        
 trailers. A combine harvester is a big
 machine that cuts the crops and shakes
 the grains out of the ear. When the   
 driver switches the spout on the grain
 comes out of the end spout into the   
 trailer. We then empty it into a barn.
 In a few days lorries come and load up
 with grain using a mechanical shovel. 
 They then take it to a mill where some
 grain is ground into bread flour.     </content>
