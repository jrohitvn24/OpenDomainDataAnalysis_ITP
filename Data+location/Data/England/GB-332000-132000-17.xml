		<title>17WORKING FOR A LIVING</title>
		<content> Occupations in Westonzoyland today are
 very different from about a hundred   
 years ago.Then peoples occupations    
 were connected with farming mostly and
 they lived and worked in the          
 village.Today our village is very much
{a dormitory village}with most people  
 living here and working elsewhere. .  
{ The biggest employer is our school.} 
 We employ some 20 people to service   
 the needs of the school.Localfarms use
 mostly family labour.The Somerset     
 Youth Association Headquarters caters 
 for visiting youth and handicapped    
 visitors.The shops and pubs employ    
 local staff.Most of the working       
 population travel into Bridgwater for 
 work at British Cellophane or to      
 Hinkley Point Nuclear Power           
 Station.Many work in commerce in      
 Bridgwater.Some go to R.O.F.Puriton.
