		<content>     The area comprises the north-     
 eastern sector of Knutsford which is  
 divided into the housing areas of Shaw
 Heath, Cross Town and Longridge.  Shaw
 Heath is an established council       
 estate, Longridge is the Manchester   
 overspill estate while Cross Town is a
 mixture of owner occupied and council 
 houses.                               
      The other main centre of         
 population is the village of Mobberley
 which lies abreast the Knutsford to   
 Wilmslow Road.                        
      There are two main areas of      
 industry. The Parkgate and Longridge  
 Industrial Estates consist of a       
 variety of small industrial units.    
      The village of Mobberley is      
 dominated by Ilford Photographic works
 which has recently undergone massive  
 expansion. The largest part of the    
 area is agricultural land.            </content>
