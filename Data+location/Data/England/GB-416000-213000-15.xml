		<title>15AN INTERVIEW</title>
		<content>   Mrs Longhurst has lived in the area 
 all her life.She told us of the       
 changes during the last 50 years.She  
 told of the loss of many trees.Before 
 the war much land was used for        
 grazing,but now more is used for      
 cereals.There used to be more children
 in the area than there are today. The 
 buildings have changed little,the     
 only new houses being built at the    
 west end of Sherborne.There used to be
 five shops,but now there is only one. 
 Shopping is inconvenient if you       
 haven't a car.There are not so many   
 buses as there used to be.During the  
 war there were many evacuees.Sherborne
 house was used by British and American
 soldiers before D.Day.Mock battles    
 were held near by. Mrs Longhurst likes
 living here because it is picturesque 
 and quiet, but doesn't like the lack  
 of transport.                         </content>
