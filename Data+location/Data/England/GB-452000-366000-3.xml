   With the colliery so dominating  the
 community we felt it   should         
 come first in our pages of writing.   
   1984/85 was an exceptionally        
 difficult year for the people of      
 Shirebrook , due to the National      
 Miners' strike. Not only did it affect
 the peace and harmony between miners  
 and their families , but also the     
 livelihood of many local tradespeople.
    Four miners' children visited the  
 colliery and interviewed the manager. 
 Here are their questions and answers. 
 Q. How many people are employed at the
 pit ?                                 
 A. 2,063 .                            
 Q. How many people work underground?  
 A. 1,765.
