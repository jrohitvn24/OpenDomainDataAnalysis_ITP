		<content>  Woodchester Park consists of about   
 three square kilometres of private    
 woodland.It is a Nature Conservancy   
 area owned partly by the N.C.A.,partly
 by the Forestry Commission and partly 
 by a consortium of private owners.    
 There is a Study Centre situated in   
 the Park where students from schools  
 and universities come to study        
 Ecology.                              
 The forest is mainly fir but each     
 block is planted with some beechwood  
 to continue growing when the fir trees
 are felled. There is one listed       
 building in the park housing a large  
 breeding colony of the rare greater   
 horseshoe bat. Many species of native 
 wild animals are to be found there,   
 especially badgers and foxes.The      
 yellow-necked woodmouse is to be found
 living alongside the ordinary         
 woodmouse.This is unique in Britain.  </content>
