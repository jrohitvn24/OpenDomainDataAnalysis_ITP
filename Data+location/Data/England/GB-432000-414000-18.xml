		<content>   Our school is nearly l.5 miles from 
 the northern boundary of the area we  
 were to survey.  Every day we noticed 
 perhaps 20 or 30 vans and lorries     
 going past school.  Sometimes even    
 more went past on specially designed  
 transporters.                         
   There seems to be nothing unusual   
 about lorries going along a busy main 
 road but these lorries all tend to be 
 white or light grey or light blue;    
 have no lettering on them, and usually
 only consist of the chassis and cab.  
 Finally all the lorries and vans are  
 produced by Mercedes Benz.            
  On our land use survey we discovered 
 that just off the A6l road and lKm    
 south of Newmillerdam and surrounded  
 by woods is the regional depot for    
 Mercedes Benz trucks.These trucks and 
 vans are stored and prepared for sale 
 after arriving in this country.       </content>
