		<title>18HIPPERHOLME LIBRARY</title>
		<content> The building which is now Hipperholme 
 Library used to be Council offices    
 until 1930. There are 9567 books in   
 the library altogether and 1867       
 members borrow books. There were      
 two lady librarians working at the    
 library when we went and one said     
 she had worked there 27 years.        
 They both enjoyed their work.         
 The most popular books were gardening,
 cookery, travel books and books about 
 Famous people. Also in the Library    
 there are some newspapers and you can 
 get information on the area. To track 
 down the books, they look in the      
 catalogue for the number.
