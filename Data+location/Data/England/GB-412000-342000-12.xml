		<title>12Public Transport in the Area</title>
		<content>Public transport is carried out by two 
local bus companies, the train service 
having been closed down in the 1950's. 
In the villages of Norbury and Roston  
and Snelston the bus company is Glovers
of Ashbourne.  They operate a daily    
school service taking secondary school 
children into Ashbourne.  Also market  
day visits weekly to Uttoxeter and     
Derby with a twice weekly service to   
Ashbourne.  On some routes the bus     
company operates a mini bus.           
  The other bus company which has just 
taken over the route is Stevensons of  
Uttoxeter.  They now operate between   
Uttoxeter and Ashbourne on a regular   
hourly service connecting in Ashbourne 
with the Trent Bus Company to Derby.   
In Uttoxeter Stevenson's have a regular
service to Burton.  A small railway    
station also operates in Uttoxeter     
connecting to mainline stations.       </content>
