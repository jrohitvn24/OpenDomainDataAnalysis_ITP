		<title>07ST. PETER'S CHURCH, OFFHAM</title>
		<content> To get to Hamsey Church you have to go
 through a muddy farmyard so Sir Henry 
 Shiffner, the local squire, decided to
 have a new church built in Offham.    
 Many local people gave money and the  
{large gothic building was completed in
{1858.}Inside are many interesting     
 features such as the font which bears 
 one of many{Gospel quotations.}The    
 church is decorated by fine windows,  
 some stained, others of cheaper clear 
 glass, replacements after damage      
 caused by a violent storm in 1981.    
 The processional cross beside the     
 choir stalls was carved by a local    
 craftsman from the wood of the old    
 choir pews in Hamsey Church.          
 At the time of the building there was 
 usually a large congregation.{Now     
{fewer people come to church}and the   
 rector is able to have another job    
 simultaneously as a college lecturer. </content>
