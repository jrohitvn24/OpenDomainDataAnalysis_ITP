		<content>    The energy required for cooking our
 food and heating our homes comes in   
 various guises.  The cheapest but most
 cumbersome is solid fossilised fuel in
 the form of raw coal or anthracite.   
 This has the disadevantages of        
 polluting the atmosphere and requiring
 almost constant attention.            
     Fuel oil is more expensive but the
 system can be made automatic.  It also
 requires no carrying into the house   
 and leaves behind no ash to be cleared
 away.                                 
     Gas is comparable in cost and has 
 all the advantges of oil,  However it 
 does very occasionally cause an       
 explosion where a fault has gone      
 undetected.                           
     The most convenient energy source 
 is electricity but if used for        
 heating, large bills must be expected.
