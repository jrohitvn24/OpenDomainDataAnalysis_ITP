		<content>    I would like to stay on at school  
 until I am eighteen years old because 
 I want to take my examinations. Then  
 I would like to go to college so that 
 I could get a job as a policewoman    
 perhaps.   I would like to be happily 
 married with three children, one boy  
 and two girls.   I wouldn't get       
 married or have children until I'd    
 worked long enough to save up some    
 money and get my own place to live.   
 I would probably have to get a flat   
 because I wouldn't be able to afford a
 house straight away.   If I couldn't  
 be a policewoman I'd like to be a     
 secretary and work in an office,      
 because I like writing and things like
 that.   I would like my husband to be 
 a man who shares things and who is    
 kind to our children.   We would go   
 shopping together on Saturdays and we 
 would share other jobs as well.       </content>
