		<title>09ALONG THE RAILWAY LINE</title>
		<content>         On 21st June we went down to  
 the old railway line because there are
 lots of interesting things to see.    
 There is a disused chimney in the     
 woods that was part of the old mine   
 workings.You can find old bricks down 
 there as well with Clutton stamped on 
 them.Several houses in the village are
 made of these bricks. We interviewed  
 Mrs.Church about the railway track.   
 She told us that the track by the     
 station was sinking.There were open   
 mines on either side of the track and 
 this was making the ground subside.The
 trains had to creep through the       
 station. There is also a stone hut    
 along the line where the men kept     
 their tools. The track is now becoming
 overgrown and lots of wild flowers    
 grow there. Rabbits, foxes and        
 badgers live there.
