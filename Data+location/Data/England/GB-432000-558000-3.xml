 Our survey area displays constrasting 
 styles of housing.  The oldest part,  
 Castletown, still retains its         
 village-like appearance with many     
 pre-war flats, colliery-terraced      
 houses and semi-bungalows.  The       
 remainder of the survey area was built
 in post-war years.  Hylton Castle     
 Estate has predominantly two and three
 bedroomed semi-detached houses in     
 small groups often around a cul-de-sac
 and usually within easy reach of a    
 play area.  Downhill estate has many  
 blocks of flats termed 'S-blocks'.    
 These are three storey blocks of      
 twelve built eighteen years ago for   
 young families.  Residents have       
 complained about dampness and been    
 re-housed with the results that they  
 have become neglected and vandalised. </content>
