		<content> There are two forts in Efford,        
 Plymouth, which are connected by a    
 lane called Military Road. These forts
 are part of the North East defence    
 line of forts built to defend Plymouth
 in the 1860s from a landward attack.  
 Laira Battery - the fort nearest the  
 River Plym - and Efford Fort - the    
 next in line - were designed to have  
 15 cannon and 5 mortars, but they were
 never manned nor munitioned. Thus they
 are known as Palmerston's Follies, as 
 they were built, at a cost of about   
 10,000 pounds, on the orders of Lord  
 Palmerston, the then Prime Minister.  
 Laira Battery is now used as a scrap  
 store, and Efford Fort is the winter  
 quarters of the Showman's Guild, where
 fairground people can store their     
 shows and live in the winter. They are
 both Ancient Monuments.
