		<title>16NEWBURY FARM RODMERSHAM</title>
		<content> Newbury's 370 acres are mainly wheat, 
 oats, barley, potatoes, fruit &amp;       
 oilseed rape. Years ago no rape was   
 grown but more fruit, as well as      
 worzel &amp; kale. Wheat now covers most  
 land but the Bramley cooking apples   
 bring in most money. Dessert &amp; cooking
 apples are grown as well as cherries, 
 pears &amp; plums. These fruits are sent  
 to London, Glasgow, Liverpool, &amp;      
 sometimes Nottingham. The fruit is    
 picked by casual pickers who might    
 live in caravans on the farm. The oil 
 seed rape is grown under contract.    
 This year there are 940 sheep _ 430   
 ewes, 500 lambs &amp; 10 rams. The        
 recently covered large yard houses 200
 bullocks of various ages in the       
 winter. There were once more buildings
 than now. An oasthouse, stables,      
 piggeries &amp; an old barn have been     
 replaced by modern buildings.         </content>
