		<title>12HIGHAM FERRERS MANOR HOUSE</title>
		<content>   The Manor House ,Higham Ferrers,was 
originally built as the rectory to the 
Church.                                
                                       
   Chamberlin Phipps who have factories
both localy and worldwide, bought the  
Manor House in 1954. They use it to    
show prospective buyers the plastic and
adhesive products they make.           
                                       
   A group of pupils from the Ferrers  
School went along to see the Manor     
House. This is their report:           
                                       
"From the outside we thought the Manor 
House looked small and quite plain.    
We were suprised on entering the House 
to see how large it actually is.       
Downstairs the rooms are filled with   
impressive antiques. The upstairs      
showroom is modern and spacious, only  
the creaking floorboards tell its age."</content>
