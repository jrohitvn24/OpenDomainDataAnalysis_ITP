		<content> The cows first milking is at 5.30a.m. 
 and the second milking is at 3.30p.m. 
 It takes 2-3hrs in the morning and    
 afternoon.Each cow produces 5 gallons 
 a day on average.In the winter they   
 eat silage,winter wheat and straw.    
 In the summer they eat grass. There   
 are 485 cows altogether and the breed 
 is Old English Friesian.              
  Mr.Estrop the farmer wakes at 5.30a.m
 for the cows first milking and starts 
 work at 5.45a.m.Milking finishes at   
 8.00a.m. and then he has to clean and 
 scrub the parlour.The rest of the     
 morning is taken up with sterilising  
 the milk or erecting fencing.A "big"  
 lunch break follows from 12.00-1.00pm.
 After lunch he either moves paddock   
 fencing,bellcarts or in the summer    
 makes silage.There is a tea break at  
 3.00p.m. and the second milking at    
 3.30pm.He usually gets home at 6.00pm.</content>
