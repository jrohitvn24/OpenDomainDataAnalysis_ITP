 Forty years ago wherever you lived in 
 N.Wingfield,a colliery tip was in view
 but there were also green fields      
 behind the ribbon development         
 housing.This was mainly rows of       
 terraced mine-workers' houses,with    
 neither bathrooms nor running hot     
 water and heated by coal.Most houses  
 were overcrowded containing three     
 generations.Post-war rented houses    
 were replaced in 1952/3 by council    
 housing(Whiteleas estate);old         
 terraces were replaced in 1953 by the 
 Alma estate(built by the NCB).In the  
 1960/70's,with the increase in        
 home-ownership,private estates grew up
 behind the ribbon development.Now all 
 houses have bathrooms, inside toilets 
 and hot water.Many of the green fields
 are now housing estates and the       
 colliery tips have gone.{J.D.Fisher.} </content>
