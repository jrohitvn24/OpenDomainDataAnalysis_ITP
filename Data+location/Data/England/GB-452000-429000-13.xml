		<title>13 DANCE'S ANIMAL FEEDSTUFFS</title>
		<content> Dances is on the junction of Gateforth
 Lane in Hambleton.Their main job is to
 mill food for the animals.They don't  
 do a lot of barley but they mix       
 together bones,meat,dried milk and    
 starch.They grind the food together   
 and make it into powder.The raw       
 materials are brought from all over   
 the country and when the food has been
 milled they are sent all over the     
 north of England including British Oil
 and Cake Mills in Selby where they are
 made into animal pellets.The present  
 firm began in 1965 and employs 5      
 men.Mr.Dances father was manager      
 before him and he's been there for 20 
 years.The building itself is a listed 
 building and is protected by the      
 government and was built in 1816.They 
 work from 8.00-5.00.When the          
 ingrediants have been milled they are 
 stored at Campeys Storage Depot.      </content>
