		<content> Mrs Hinett remembers that it wasn't   
 until 1934 that water was laid on.    
 Before this water was drawn from a    
 pump,which was situated between the   
 house and the first classroom.On wash-
 days the children were not allowed to 
 play in the garden due to the         
 headmasters wife hanging out her      
 washing there. The boys had to draw   
 thewater for her from the pumps to    
 fill her copper-boiler.               
  Very rarely was there any games or   
 P.E.because there wasn't a playing    
 field and the classrooms were not big 
 enough.At the start of the day all the
 children congregated at the end of    
 Back Lane and were then escorted past 
 the Bear's Head and on to school.     
  In conclusion Mrs.Hinett has seen a  
 lot of changes during her life time   
 and she feels they are not all for the
 better.                               </content>
