		<content>    There is a variety of houses in the
 village from new bungalows to older   
 terraced houses.Some of them are farm 
 houses.                               
    Water supplies were provided to the
 houses about 100 years ago.           
    In our house we have an open fire- 
 place in the front room and a Parkray 
 in the dining room with a boiler at   
 the back for the hot water.We use an  
 airing cupboard for drying damp       
 clothes to make them warm and fresh.  
 In the bathroom is a toilet, sink and 
 bath. People did not used to have a   
 bathroom and the toilet was at the end
 of the garden. We use our old toilet  
 as a woodshed.                        
     The older houses were built with  
 granite stones but the modern ones are
 built with brick or concrete blocks.
