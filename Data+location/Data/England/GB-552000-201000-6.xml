		<title>06H0USING IN ONGAR</title>
		<content> In Ongar about{90%}of the people own  
 their own houses.{10%}of the people   
 rent their houses, almost all living  
 on the council estate. We established 
 that {75%} of Ongar people had lived  
 here over five years.                 
 Under half of the people interviewed  
 had moved from{"the Greater London    
{Area",}though lots of them had moved  
 because of their jobs or because the  
 houses were cheaper at the time.Not   
 many first time buyers or O.A.P.'s    
 come to Ongar; because the houses     
 are mainly designed for families.     
  The most popular houses in Ongar are 
{3/4 bedroom detached}and{semi_detached
{houses.}Most buyers tend to like      
 houses on newly built estates.Others  
 buy houses just outside Ongar where   
 they can be within easy reach of the  
 station.Some houses in Ongar date back
 to the 14th Century.                  </content>
