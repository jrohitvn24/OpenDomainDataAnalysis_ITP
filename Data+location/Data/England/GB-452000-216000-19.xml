		<title>19Weston School: Some Opinions</title>
		<content> The community of Weston is saddened by
 the loss of its school which can only 
 increase the age imbalance in its pop-
 ulation. The high cost of housing and 
 Weston's designation as a 'No Growth' 
 village have already discouraged young
 couples from settling in the village  
 and the closure of the school will not
 improve the situation.                
                                       
 Local parents feel that their children
 (bussed to 3 different schools) have  
 lost the benefit of living in a strong
 integrated community. Many people will
 miss events such as the Christmas     
 Bazaar and Carol Singing which brought
 them together at the school. Older    
 people miss the ringing of the school 
 bell and the sound of the children's  
 games at playtime or as they jumped   
 the stile to shortcut home along the  
 field path.                           </content>
