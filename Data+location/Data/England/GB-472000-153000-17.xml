		<title>17NO HOOK REMEMBRANCE SERVICE</title>
		<content> The Vicar of Hook,Rev.Brian Richards, 
 has said he will not take a special   
 Remembrance Sunday service with       
 military march for local Royal British
 Legion members as he sees 'nothing    
 worshipful about it'.However, he has  
 stressed they will be very welcome at 
 either of his remembrance services in 
 church during the morning and they can
 of course parade as they wish. The    
 Parish Council and Mr Bill Baggs,Hart 
 Councillor,have shown approval for the
 march. Mr Dennis Gary,Legion branch   
 secretary,has said he knows of over 50
 members who would appreciate their own
 village service,especially as many do 
 not have cars and are now elderly.    
 Plans are now being made to gather at 
 the War Memorial and to march to a    
 service at either the Hook Junior     
 School or Elizabeth Hall and to ask   
 another vicar to take the service.    </content>
