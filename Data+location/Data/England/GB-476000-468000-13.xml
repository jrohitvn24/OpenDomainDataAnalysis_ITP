		<content> It was soon after the First World War 
 that Mr Chouler, the founder of the   
 company, decided over a game of       
 dominoes in a Norton-on-Derwent public
 house to set up a small steel works in
 the town.                             
                                       
 At that time, production of steel     
 "flats" was in its infancy and Mr     
 Chouler struggled to survive. It was  
 not long, however, before his         
 enterprise gained reward and he was   
 dealing with some of the largest firms
 in the engineering trade.             
                                       
 Bright Steels' success and            
 subsequent expansion of business has  
 meant that more production space has  
 had to be created. Large extensions   
 have, therefore, been built on the    
 company's present four acre site at   
 Beverley Road, Norton-on-Derwent.     </content>
