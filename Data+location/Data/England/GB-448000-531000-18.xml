		<title>18Unemployment in Hartlepool</title>
		<content>      Full employment in Hartlepool has
 not been known for many years.  There 
 has always been a higher than national
 average of the people of Hartlepool   
 unemployed, but over the past few     
 years the problem has become more and 
 more acute to the point where         
 Hartlepool now has one of the, if not 
 the, highest percentages of people    
 unemployed in the country.            
      Apart from the national trend of 
 unemployment, another major reason for
 Hartlepools abnormally high rate is   
 the run down and disappearance of its 
 heavy industries i.e., shipbuilding   
 and iron and steel, which were highly 
 labour intensive.  In their place     
 there has been an attempt to introduce
  lots of smaller manufacturing units  
 not labour intensive but producing a  
 wider range of goods.  To a small     
 extent this has been successful.      </content>
