		<title>17O.A.P. Survey by Neil Flux.</title>
		<content> We did a survey of old age pensioners 
 in West Taphouse to find out what life
 is like for them.                     
  They like living in West Taphouse but
 the traffic is very noisy and some    
 find it a little inconvenient for     
 shoping etc.                          
  Half go to Liskeard for their main   
 shoping,banking and medical services  
 and half go to Lostwithiel.           
  Most travel by car but some rely on  
 Public Transport.                     
  If they are ill most rely on someone 
 to call and help them.                
  Hobbies enjoyed by the O.A.P. are    
 gardening,pottering with car engines, 
 dancing,darts,knitting,sewing,painting
 sightseeing,scrabble,chess,draughts   
 and television.                       
  Things could be better for the O.A.P.
 by giving them more help,more pension 
 and more clubs for getting together.  </content>
