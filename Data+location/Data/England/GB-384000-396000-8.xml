		<content>  It is said that the city contains the
 greatest concentration of students in 
 Higher Education in Western Europe.   
 Undergraduate and Graduate studies in 
 the Arts, Sciences, Technology and    
 Medecine take place in an area centred
 on either side of Oxford Road. The    
 Victoria University of Manchester, the
 University of Manchester Institute of 
 Science and Technology plus the       
 Manchester Business School all have   
 students from Britain and abroad.     
  The Manchester Polytechnic is the    
 culmination of a process of           
 federation, amalgamation and          
 absorption of a number of Colleges and
 the courses cover teacher education,  
 community studies, industrial and     
 manufacturing studies, and art and    
 design. With the Teaching Hospitals   
 and the Royal Northern College of     
 Music there is a vast choice of work. </content>
