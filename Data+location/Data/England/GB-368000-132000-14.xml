		<title>14Sexey's Hospital.</title>
		<content> Hugh Sexey was born in Bruton in the  
 mid 16th century. Later to become     
 auditor to Queen Elizabeth I, he      
 became a wealthy man and a great      
 benefactor to his home town.  Besides 
 leaving money to promote education in 
 Bruton, his will made provision for   
 the establishment of Almshouses.  The 
 Almshouses, or Sexey's Hospital as it 
 is now known, were built in the early 
 17th century.  The chapel and the     
 buildings around the quadrangle were  
 the first to be built, and a new block
 of buildings were added in 1882.  It  
 was at this time that the outside     
 staircases and balcony to the rooms   
 were added.  The first inmates of the 
 Hospital were 12 elderly men and      
 women; in 1985, there are 20          
 residents, looked after by the Master 
 and the Matron.
