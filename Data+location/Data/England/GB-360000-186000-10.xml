		<content> Some children from St. Helens School  
 talked to Mrs. Summers who was a pupil
 at the old St. Helens School. She was 
 also a pupil teacher, a teacher and a 
 deputy head. "I remember how we always
 sat in long rows throughout the day   
 and always in our own places, never   
 getting up. Children today have so    
 much freedom in and out of the        
 classroom, they don't know how to sit 
 still. I remember the headmaster stood
 in front of the coal fire with his    
 hands always behind his back." "We    
 always went to Sunday School. We wore 
 our best clothes which we were only   
 allowed to wear on a Sunday." "After  
 school we had another pinefore on. I  
 enjoyed sewing. The candles and oil   
 lights brought the darkness early."   
 " I think I would prefer 1985!"
