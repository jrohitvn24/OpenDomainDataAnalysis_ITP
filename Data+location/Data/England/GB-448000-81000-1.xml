		<content> Our block is mainly a farming area    
 with scattered settlement of farm     
 houses and cottages. The Medina valley
 lies in the centre of the area, so the
 ground rises to east and west (Maximum
 145 metres on Berry hill). Land in the
 west is mainly arable, growing cereal 
 crops, changing to grassland towards  
 the east.                             
     In the north are the two largest  
 areas of settlement, the villages of  
 Chillerton and Rookley, both showing  
 signs of rapid growth. Roughly half   
 the population work and shop in       
 Newport. A{"HELP THE AGED"}bus to     
 Newport give the elderly a change from
 shopping in the local Spar store. We  
 found the people very kind and        
 friendly.
