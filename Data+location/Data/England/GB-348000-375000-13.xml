 one primary school and that is Helsby 
 Hillside.Its position is between Bates
 Lane and Chester Road.The school is   
 surrounded by two playgrounds. It is  
 made up of three buildings.The first  
 building contains two classrooms,only 
 one is in use.The main building has   
 five classrooms and a hall where meal 
 time takes place and a kitchen where  
 the meals are made.There are          
 separate  cloakrooms for infants      
 and juniors .Near to one playground is
 a demountable which is soon to be     
 demolished. In class we do Maths and  
 English in which we write a story of  
 some sort.In craft we make things with
 different materials and in P.E we play
 different sports and games. We also do
 music,history and geography.
