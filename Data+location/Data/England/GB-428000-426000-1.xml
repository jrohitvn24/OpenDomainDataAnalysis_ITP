 Middleton is located on the south side
 of Leeds and is on the very edge of   
 the city.Our area is classed as an    
 urban area but on the boundary of     
 Middleton lie open fields.Therefore we
 have a mixture of town and semi rural 
 life.                                 
 The main housing estate and a great   
 many of the buildings were built in   
 the 1920's and are therefore now over 
 60yrs old.Most of the houses are owned
 by Leeds City Council,but there are a 
 tiny number of private housing.There  
 are a number of shops on various      
 sites.                                
 The principle features  of the area   
 include:a)M62   b)Chloride Metal      
 Works.  c)A very large council estate.
 d)A number of farms.  e)A main Trade  
 Union building belongs to N.U.P.E.    </content>
