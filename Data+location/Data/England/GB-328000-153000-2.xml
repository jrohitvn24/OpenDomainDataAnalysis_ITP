		<title>02OLD HOUSING IN BERROW</title>
		<content>     In the Berrow area there are      
 quite a number of old houses which are
being modernised.These are fairly big  
houses,most are single storey.         
           We talked to some           
inhabitants and asked them some        
questions.Among their comments were the
following:-one couple were moving;one  
oldish person complained about the     
footpaths and said,he wanted another   
road connected into the Lesiure centre 
so there wouldn't be so much traffic,or
a footpath.People thought the area was 
safe for children to play but they     
weren't too pleased about the beach    
because of the nudists at weekends.    
           In the winter there is      
nothing to do,but in summer there is   
plenty to do and see.The transport in  
Brean is adequate in the summer,but in 
winter there is not enough.
