		<title>02Courteenhall Village</title>
		<content> The village of 23 houses is situated  
 to the east of Courteenhall House. Six
 houses were Council- built in 1951,   
 the others of local stone were all    
 thatched until modernisation took     
 place in 1961, also the year when the 
 sewage works was built.               
 There is a sub-post office which is   
 open 4 days a week, an Art Gallery, a 
 900 year old church, and an active    
 Choral Society. The village is served 
 by a travelling Butcher and Baker.    
 The 23 children, mostly of school age,
 have to travel to the nearby villages 
 of Roade or Collingtree for Primary   
 Education.
