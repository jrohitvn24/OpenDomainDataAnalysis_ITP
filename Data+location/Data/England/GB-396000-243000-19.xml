		<title>19A New Oil Pipeline</title>
		<content> Southampton to Wolverhampton          
                                       
 Part of this pipeline is running      
 through this block.Firstly a swathe   
 20 yards wide is cut through all      
 agricultural ground and fenced,apart  
 from the underwater crossing of the   
 river where steel sheet piles are     
 driven into the river bed to allow the
 pipes to sink between.The steel pipes 
 are laid on top of the ground and     
 welded together in long sections.Each 
 joint is X-rayed before being sunk    
 into the ground.Land drains are laid  
 simultaneously top and bottom.The     
 ground is then re-instated to its     
 original environment and compensation 
 paid to the farmers.                  
 The cost of this pipeline is half a   
 million pounds per mile paid for by   
 the Oil Company.
