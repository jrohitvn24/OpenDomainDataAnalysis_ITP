 Landscape: The major feature of the   
 block is undulating farmland coupled  
 with areas of mixed woodland. the area
 generally comprises the foothills of  
 the Pennines. The River Etherow       
 crosses the area diagonally from      
 Northeast to Southwest, effectively   
 separating the block into two         
 halves.The valley of the Etherow has  
 been developed into a popular Country 
 Park with one of its main entry       
 points in the village of Compstall.   
 The block is partly in Stockport,     
 Greater Manchester and partly in      
 the High Peak of Derbyshire. It is an 
 area of great natural beauty.
