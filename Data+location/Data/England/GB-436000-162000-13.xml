		<title>13  INTERVIEW WITH MUM</title>
		<content>   At school there were rows of desks  
 and they had two to a desk.  They used
 ink-wells and dip-in pens.  They did a
 lot of work off the blackboard.       
   Hardly anyone had a car because they
 couldn't afford one.  A lot of the    
 cars were black and most of the       
 bicycles were heavier than they are   
 today.                                
   The ladies wore stockings because   
 tights had not been invented.  Little 
 boys wore shorts and only wore long   
 trousers when they were about 13.     
   People only had chicken at Christmas
 or Easter and there were no currys or 
 frozen foods because nobody had a     
 freezer.  The entertainment was the   
 cinema and the radio, there was no    
 television in those days.  The games  
 were hide and seek, kick can turkey,  
 rugby, train spotting, whip and top,  
 tich, marbles, conkers and jacks.     </content>
