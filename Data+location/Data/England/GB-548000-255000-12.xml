 My Great Gran came to live in Church  
 End which is about the oldest part  of
  Cherry Hinton in her early 'teens.'  
 There was a tap in the middle of the  
 road which supplied the area with     
 water.In 1920 she went to work at the 
 cement works which are now closed     
 down.They worked 12 hours a day.The   
 cement works were then used for       
 crushing old iron and steel to put on 
 the land.The larger pieces were picked
 out so that the machines did not get  
 broken.They had no tranport to get    
 into town for shopping so they had to 
 walk to Mill Road where they could    
 catch a bus which was a horse and     
 cart.It cost one penny.She told me how
 Cherry Hinton has changed.It is now a 
 small town.
