		<title>10DOG BREEDERS, HAYDON BRIDGE</title>
		<content> Mrs.Hawley of Heugh Lane Cottage is a 
 Judge of Belgian Dogs and a breeder of
 champion{Belgian Shepherd dogs.}There 
 are 3 types of Belgian shepherd: the  
 Groenendael which is long-haired &amp;    
 black; the Malinois, short-haired &amp;   
 red; and the Tevuren, long-coated &amp;   
 either red or grey in colour. All are 
 great characters.                     
 These dogs were originally bred to    
 guard sheep rather than herd them,    
 During the '39-'45 War many were      
 killed carrying messages sent by the  
 Underground Belgian people who        
 actively opposed the Germans. For this
 reason and wartime shortage of food   
 for dogs, the breed was small in no.in
 1945. This necessitated fierce        
 in-breeding and some dogs still       
 become too nervous and fierce. The    
 cost of a show specimen is about Â£150 
                                       </content>
