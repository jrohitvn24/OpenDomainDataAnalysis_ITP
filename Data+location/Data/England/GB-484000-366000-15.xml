		<title>15STANDARD OF LIVING</title>
		<content>   Our group decided to find out how   
 high the standard of living is in     
 our village of Eagle.We wrote a list  
 out and we put down costly items which
 people might own.We each went round a 
 classroom.We asked each child what    
 they had got in their homes.          
   Of the 50 families inthe school 66% 
 had 1 car and 36% had 2 or more       
 cars.Videos were found in 68% of the  
 houses.Only 36% of the families had 1 
 colour T.V.but 56% of the people had 2
 or more colour T.V's.Hi-fi units were 
 found in 82% of the houses.Three      
 families had 2 Hi-Fi units.           
   Of the families which were in the   
 school 86% had a telephone in their   
 homes.Deep freezers were owned by 24% 
 of the families.We wonder what people 
 will have in their homes in a hundred 
 years time.
