		<title>04The Motorway</title>
		<content>The motorway, the M.20, has been built 
so that traffic can reach London       
easily. Drivers travel to Folkestone   
going south, then onto Dover, probably 
to catch the ferry across the English  
Channel. The road has been built on an 
embankment close to the northern edge  
of the houses at Willesborough. Many   
large container lorries can now avoid  
driving through Ashford town centre.   
Some local children think that too much
countryside has been destroyed to make 
way for the building of such roads.    
Others can see the need for being able 
to drive longer distances more easily. 
There is a speed limit of 70miles per  
hour. Children can cross the road by   
footbridges. Smaller roads can cross   
under or over the motorway via a       
bridge.
