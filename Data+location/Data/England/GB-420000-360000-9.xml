		<content>  The area is visited by holiday makers
 and day visitors. There are footpaths 
 for the walker (23 in Elton parish    
 alone) providing varied scenery and   
 good long distance views.             
  The gritstone outcrops of Robin Hoods
 Stride and Cratcliffe are used by rock
 climbers and there is much to interest
 the bird watcher and naturalist. Ski- 
 ing and tobogganing take place after  
 Winter snowfalls.                     
  A few houses provide bed &amp; breakfast 
 accommodation and there are two camp  
 sites. There is a self-catering Youth 
 Hostel at Elton. In addition there are
 seventeen furnished cottages available
 for holiday letting.                  
  The Druid Inn at Birchover serves    
 midday and evening meals whilst sand- 
 wiches are available at the Red Lion. 
 A cafe opened in 1984 at the former   
 Post Office in Elton.                 </content>
