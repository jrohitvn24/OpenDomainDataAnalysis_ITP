		<content>   In the village there is a doctors'  
 surgery at Eden End occupying part of 
 a building which was once a silk mill 
 and then a cottage hospital. There are
 three doctors in the practice and the 
 surgery reception desk is manned daily
 during working hours.                 
   The practice covers several other   
 villages as well as Broad Oak and     
 there is a subsidiary surgery of the  
 same practice at Hatfield Heath. As   
 there is no chemist's shop nearer than
 Bishop's Stortford the surgeries      
 incorporate dispensaries. There is    
 also a district nurse who works in the
 village, mainly visiting old people.  
   The nearest hospitals are in        
 Bishop's Stortford and Harlow, as are 
 the nearest dental surgeons. The      
 nearest vetinary surgery also is in   
 Bishop's Stortford.
