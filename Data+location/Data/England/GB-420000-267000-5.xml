		<title>05THE GHOSTS OF SHREWLEY</title>
		<content>                                       
The Shrewley area is supposed to have a
number of ghosts which haunt and roam  
about Shrewley. They are all connected 
to the BATTLE OF EDGE HILL, which was  
the first main battle of the Civil War 
(1642-1649).  Local legend says that   
hundreds of Cavaliers were butchered by
forces coming South during the night   
while they were asleep.  This happened 
a few days before the actual battle.   
                                       
Local SUPERSTITIOUS inhabitants say    
that they rise at regular intervals to 
gain revenge on the Roundheads.        
                                       
Although Warwickshire was under the    
command of the King, the ordinary      
people preferred Parliament.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
