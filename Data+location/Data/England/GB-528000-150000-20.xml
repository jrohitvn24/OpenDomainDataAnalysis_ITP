 The{HOLMETHORPE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE}    
 covers about{SIXTY ACRES.}The land was
 originally used to extract sand.      
 However the sand ran out and the land 
 was used to build industrial units.   
 Many small firms are now located on   
 the estateand more new units are being
 built. The estate is successful and   
 many businesses want to build         
 factories there.                      
                                       
 There are problems of access to the   
 estate.  Many lorries have to use{    
{FRENCHES ROAD}and then drive through a
 narrow railway arch.  They pass       
 outside our school.  This creates a   
 lot of NOISE and POLLUTION as well as 
 being quite DANGEROUS.
