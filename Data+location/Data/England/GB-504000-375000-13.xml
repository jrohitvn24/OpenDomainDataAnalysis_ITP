 Our D block has a lot of oil in  the  
 ground.  Consequently  there are      
 three oil rigs in our D block. Because
  the oil lies so deep in the ground   
 it has not been exploited before.     
 Modern technology has made it possible
 to bring oil to the surface and to    
 find it at great depth.Another oil rig
 has been set up recently.The oil rigs 
 have brought badly needed jobs to the 
 area.They have also brought new people
 to the area and more business for the 
 shops,pubs and inns.                  
   Teams of drillers are working on    
 site and big lorries bring            
 concrete and metal pipes.The pipes    
 are coated with tar and binding and   
 are piled beside the drilling site.
