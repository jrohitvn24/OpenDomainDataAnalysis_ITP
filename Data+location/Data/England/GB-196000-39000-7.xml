		<content> There has been a village school on    
 the present site since 1880.However,  
 the old school(Anne Treneer's "School 
 House in the Wind")was destroyed by   
 fire in 1967.The new modern school is 
 granite and glass with a flat roof.it 
 is an open-plan design with three     
 classrooms around a central hall,an   
 art area,a kitchen,a library,and a    
 staff room.Outside are playgrounds,a  
 playing field,a swimming pool,lawns   
 and trees,and beyond the surrounding  
 fields we have a view of the sea.At   
 present there 104 pupils,they come    
 from the villages of Gorran and Gorran
 Haven,and from outlying hamlets and   
 farms.At the age 11 they transfer to  
 the Roseland School a small           
 comprehensive school at Tregony 7     
 miles away.
