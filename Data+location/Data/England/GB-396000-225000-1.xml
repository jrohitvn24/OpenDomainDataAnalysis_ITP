		<content>{Woodmancote School}square consists    
 mainly of residential landcover.      
 Most of the houses are long           
 established and one or two are several
 centuries old and thatched.Around the 
 school, which is 11 years old,a       
 housing estate is largely completed.  
 There is also a permanent caravan site
 with room for summer camping.         
    The boundary between Bishop's      
 Cleeve and Woodmancote is drawn by the
 disused Honeybourne railway line which
 was once the main G.W.R. route north. 
    Amenities include S.John Fisher    
 hall and the old Bishops Cleeve school
 building vacated when the Infant and  
 Junior schools combined.Now the       
 buildings are used for community      
 functions,blood donations and the     
 like.
