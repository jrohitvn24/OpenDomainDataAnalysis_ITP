		<title>02Mr. Palmer's Farm</title>
		<content>  {Mr.Palmer}has worked on a farm all  
 his working life. His farm is small   
 compared to other farms, but consists 
 of{50 cows, 35}of which are{milkers,  
{and 15 calves.}On his farm Mr. Palmer 
 employs{6 people.}The machinery he    
 owns is{a combine harvester, 3        
{tractors and attachments.}Mr. Palmer's
 cows  produce an average of{80 to 85  
{gallons of milk a day.}Besides milk,  
 Mr. Palmer deals in{sugar beet, corn  
{and barley.}Modern machinery has meant
 a loss of jobs on the farm. In        
 December he turns the soil over and   
 sharp frosts do the land good. In the 
 Spring he cultivates the soil and sows
 his{Spring barley.}He has to have a   
 good start to the year or his land    
 will dry up. After Spring he has to be
 ready for sugar beet which he sows in 
 March. In Summer he harvests his corn 
 and in Autumn he harvests his beet.   </content>
