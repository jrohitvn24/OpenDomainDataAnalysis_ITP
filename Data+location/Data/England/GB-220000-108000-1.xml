 rugged and the land very hilly, rising

 many valleys which are deep,          
 steep-sided,and thickly wooded.Few    
 trees grow near the coast which       
 appears to be{windswept.}             
{   }There are very few{settlements}in 
 the area.The largest is called Stibb  
 and is a small hamlet.Other buildings 
 are mostly scattered farmhouses and   
 more modern houses built especially   
 for{retired people.}In the far south, 
 there is part of a modern bungalow    
 estate at Poughill.
