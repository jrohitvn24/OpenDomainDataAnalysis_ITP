		<content> Most houses are privately-owned and   
 have front and back gardens.Nearly all
 have at least one garage.New houses   
 being built are predominately         
 detached,but there is also a good     
 number of semi-detached property as   
 well as bungalows,many having been    
 built in the Thirties.In the last     
 decade purpose-built blocks of flats  
 have made an appearance,particularly  
 along the High Road as have rows of   
 'Town'or 'Link' Houses in small       
 terraces near the station.Homes for   
 elderly people who require special    
 care are available.There is also such 
 a home for young people.A small amount
 of rented Council accommodation is    
 available,mostly in semi-detached     
 cottage-style house.
