		<title>04LIMESTONE QUARRY</title>
		<content> Less than a mile east of Creswell     
 Colliery there is an outcrop of       
 limestone which attracted the         
 attentions of the Steetley Company who
 established a quarry here.            
 The quarry face is drilled and filled 
 with explosives which cause the       
 limestone to fall to the floor of the 
 quarry. It is loaded onto large       
 lorries and carried the short distance
 to the works. Here it is crushed into 
 different sizes before being used as  
 road foundations and ballast. Some of 
 the limestone is burnt to produce lime
 which can be used to make cement.     
 Many local people are employed by the 
 Steetley Company, but recently, as the
 quarry gets nearer to the limits of   
 its development, some employees have  
 been made redundant.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
