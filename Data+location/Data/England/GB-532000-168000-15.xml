		<content>   We interviewed some teenagers who   
 live in the area. some were unemployed
 but not on the Youth Training Scheme. 
 One was receiving unemployment benifit
 and attended the job centre. Most     
 still lived with there parents.       
   We carried out a survey to find out 
 about the type of work that adults in 
 our area did to earn a living.        
   We found that there was a high      
 percentage of unemployed men in our   
 area and also that there were lots of 
 mothers who were trying to find work. 
 Lots of mothers are housewives,       
 looking after the babies and their    
 homes, shopping and cooking. Some     
 mothers do jobs at the home and some  
 mothers have to go out to work to earn
 some money for the family or because  
 of father is unemployed or does not   
 live at home.                         
                                       </content>
