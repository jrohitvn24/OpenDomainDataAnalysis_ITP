		<content> The River Exe provides entertainment  
 for boating and fishing enthusiasts   
 throughout the year.The football and  
 rugby clubs are active during the     
 winter months. In the summer, the     
 bowling green provides entertainment  
 for players and spectators. Just      
 opposite this there are the tennis    
 courts and swimming pool. The open air
 swimming pool is heated with solar    
 power from panels under the tennis    
 courts. There is a recreation ground  
 next to the river which has a         
 children's playground and plenty of   
 space for football and school sports. 
 In the Matthews Hall are facilities   
 for plays and concerts, bingo,        
 badminton and small exhibitions. For  
 evening entertainment adults can visit
 one of Topsham's many public houses or
 restaurants.
