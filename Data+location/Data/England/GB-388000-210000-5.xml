 You play slam with two to six people. 
 You need a football and a wall without
 any windows.                          
 The rules are you have to kick the    
 ball against the wall. If you miss the
 ball or fail to kick the ball before  
 it stops you go onto "S". If you miss 
 a second time you go onto "SL" and so 
 on. When you get to "SLAM" you are    
 out. You go on like this until there  
 is only one player left, he or she is 
 the winner. by JAMES KAY.             
            SCARECROW CHASE            
   Any number can play this.You can    
 play anywhere. The person who is on it
 has to tag somebody. If you are tagged
 you stand with your legs apart, until 
 somebody goes under them. Then they   
 start running again until they are    
 tagged.If you are a "scarecrow" you   
 cannot move.   by GAVIN ELKINS.       </content>
