		<content>   The Library,built to house the      
collection started by the third Sir    
Thomas Lucy is now the third most      
important in the possession of the N.T.
   The lands extend to some 220 acres, 
but in the height of its prosperity,   
the family owned lands extending nearly
to Coventry.                           
   The Park was landscaped in 1760 by  
Launcelot 'Capability' Brown.          
   The Park supports herds of deer;the 
Fallow have been here for centuries,but
the Red deer were introduced in the    
middle of the last century. In         
Shakespeare's time, the deer would have
been the much smaller Roe deer. There  
is also a herd of Jacob sheep          
introduced over 200 years ago,and this 
year(1985) the former herd of cattle   
was replaced by a Charolais cross.     
   The present tenant is Sir Edmund    
Cameron Ramsay Fairfax Lucy,6th baronet</content>
