		<title>19A SENIOR CITIZEN' DAY</title>
		<content> I usually get up at about 6.30 a.m.   
 and have my breakfast of toast,       
 marmalade and grapefruit.Then I dress 
 and then perhaps do one of my hobbies.
 I have many hobbies and a few of them 
 are to do with needlework but my      
 favourite hobby is gardening.Also in  
 the morning I do the newspaper        
 crossword and I usually have friends  
 for coffee or I visit friends.After   
 lunch I sit down and put my feet up.I 
 attend a lot of meetings as I am      
 involved with the W.I.,the Save the   
 Children Fund and the Parish Council. 
 In the evening I sometimes watch      
 television. My favourite programmes   
 are about gardening and nature.I also 
 like Coronation Street,Emmerdale Farm 
 and One Man and His Dog.I also like to
 watch the 'fuddy-duddy' programmes.   
 When I go to bed I always have a good 
 night's sleep.                        </content>
