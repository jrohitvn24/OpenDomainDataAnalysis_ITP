		<title>18MRS.SMITH-PEARCE WILDHERN</title>
		<content> Mrs.Smith-Pearce was born in 1893 and 
 spent many years in India where she   
 remembers shooting a panther and      
 finishing off a wounded tiger.She     
 moved to Wildhern in 1963 after living
 for many years at Tangley House.She   
 firmly believes that modern houses    
 should all face south so that they    
 could receive the maximum amount of   
 sunlight.The local bus service enables
 her to shop in Andover once a week and
 she thinks that daily gardening helps 
 to keep her so fit.Her other main     
 interest is sewing which she sells to 
 raise money for an orphanage in       
 Bangladesh.She finds few problems for 
 the old living in a village but is    
 nervous about leaving the house when  
 she shops or attends church or when   
 she hears odd noises at night but she 
 would prefer her house to be a little 
 further away from her neighbours.     </content>
