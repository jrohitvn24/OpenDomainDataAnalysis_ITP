		<content> The outlying estates to the North of  
 the small mining town of Maltby are   
 included in our survey.Within this    
 area of housing a number of flats and 
 with flat roofs are prominent. This   
 development was built in 1941 to house
 people who came to work at the Royal  
 Ordnance Factory in Maltby.A clue to  
 the war-time origin of the area is    
 'Churchill Avenue'. Semi-detached and 
 four-house terraces followed after the
 war and the area has finally been     
 built up over the last 10 years with  
 modern bungalows, semi and fully      
 detached houses. Building is          
 continuing today as work has just     
 started on 31 flats adjacent to the   
 greenland plantation just off         
 Braithwell Road. This area is served  
 by a number of shops, three public    
 houses, a garden centre and a filling 
 station.                              </content>
