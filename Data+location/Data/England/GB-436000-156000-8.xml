		<content> Faccombe pond, lost for many years and
 feared because of the ghost of a      
 carriage that was supposed to have    
 driven into it one dark night, is now 
 an area of natural beauty supporting  
 water and marsh flora and many birds. 
 When the pond was cleared and cleaned 
 a cart axle and wheel were found in   
 the mud at the bottom.                
 Netherton old Rectory, now a private  
 house was decorated in the 17th       
 century by Inigo Jones. At the back of
 the house is a painted window of a    
 Regency gentleman sitting and reading.
 Harry Plunkett Greene sang here at    
 Festivals.                            
 Tracks and paths running through woods
 and alongside fields are still re-made
 and repaired using materials from the 
 old chalk and gravel pits on the      
 Faccombe Estate.
