		<title>01AREA OF STH. GODSTONE</title>
		<content>   Our designated area, approximately  
 20 miles from the centre of London, is
 a very rural site consisting of many  
 farms, fields and country lanes. A    
 busy trunk road, the A22 towards      
 Eastbourne, passes through Sth        
 Godstone. A school, church, and       
 railway station are the main          
 facilities here, beside a public      
 house, a garage and a few shops. St.  
 Stephen's School caters for           
 approximately 230 children who travel 
 from Blindley Heath and Godstone.     
   Crowhurst has a beautiful old church
 with an ancient Yew tree in the       
 grounds.                              
   The area has many beautiful walks,  
 cropfields, pastureland and glades.   
 Farms feature themselves prominently  
 in the area, each with their own range
 of livestock.
