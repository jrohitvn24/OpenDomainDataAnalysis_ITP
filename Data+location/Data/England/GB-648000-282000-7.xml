		<title>07A Carrot Factory &amp; A Builder</title>
		<content> The carrot factory has a lot of       
 vegetables. The tractors there are    
 very big and I am scared of them. They
 have big yellow trailers and I keep   
 out of the way. The farmers take their
 vegetables to the factory to be       
 cleaned and sorted.

 My Dad is a builder. He drives a big  
 digger and he digs holes. Today my Dad
 is making concrete. When it rains the 
 site gets muddy and he gets stuck so  
 all the mates help him. Then he has   
 dinner and after a while he comes home
 for tea.
