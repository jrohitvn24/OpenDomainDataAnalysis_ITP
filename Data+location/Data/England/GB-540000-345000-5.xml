		<title>05St.Helena's Church,Leverton</title>
		<content> Our church is the only building in the
 village more than 200 years old.It is 
 built of {oolitic limestone}from the  
 quarry at{Ancaster}near Grantham.The  
 church was built by merchants who made
 their fortunes selling wool.The church
 took over 100 years to build because  
 it coincided with the arrival of{the  
{Black Death} in the 14th century.The  
 church has many crosses because       
 St.Helena was the mother of           
 Constantine the Great who was thought 
 to have found the cross that Jesus was
 crucified on.During the Civil War the 
 Puritan army used the church as a     
 stable and,while they were there,they 
 desecrated it by pulling out the      
 mediaeval stained glass and broke or  
 damaged the statues.There are a few   
 small pieces remaining in various     
 places but the rest has never been    
 replaced.                             </content>
