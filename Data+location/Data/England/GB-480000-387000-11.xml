		<content>{   It was a very gloomy day.We went to
 the cemetery to have a look at the    
 gravestones.I felt very sorry for the 
 relatives of the people who had died. 
 The graves differed. Some were        
 immaculate,some were just a little    
 wooden cross,some were                
                  neglected and        
 overgrown.Thinking ahead one hundred  
 years,the headstone may disintegrate  
 and you may not know it is a grave    
 unless you dig and find a body.       
                                       
 As soon as I walked through the tall  
 metal gates I felt a sudden silence   
 fall around me and a saddnes filled   
 the air.All I could see on the horizon
 was gravestones.I walked past one,it  
 was grim and old.They were all        
 different shapes and sizes.I saw a    
 stone with a beautiful angel carved   
 on,another,two cheap pieces of wood.  </content>
