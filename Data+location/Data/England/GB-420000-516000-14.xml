		<content> It is a very small settlement west of 
 Walworth. There are about twelve      
 houses. One row of old cottages has   
 had a second storey added on, after it
 closed as a public house. These belong
 to the Raby estate and were used by   
 estate and farm workers. Now many of  
 the residents are retired, or commute 
 to Darlington to work.                
 In the centre of Denton there are two 
 large farms which were originally the 
 main source of{employment}for the     
 village and surrounding inhabitants.  
 There is an old{school}on the         
 outskirts of the village. This shows  
 signs of a modern extension on to the 
 original school house showing an      
 increase in population during the     
 middle part of this century. However  
 the school has recently closed as     
{population}has since declined.
