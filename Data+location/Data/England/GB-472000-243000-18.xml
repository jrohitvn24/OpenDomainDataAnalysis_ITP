  The village also has a very          
 successful drama group called         
 Potterspury Players who regularly     
 produce plays. There is also a junior 
 section of the group who's last       
 production was 'Joseph and the Amazing
 Technicolor Dreamcoat'.               
  The Potterspury Foundation is a      
 fund-raising committee in the village 
 who are responsible for organising a  
 very large two day show called the    
 'Festival of Transport' with the sole 
 aim of raising money to be spent in   
 the village on large projects. This   
 year, 1985, the event is being held in
 the Milton Keynes Bowl and 30,000     
 people are expected to attend.
