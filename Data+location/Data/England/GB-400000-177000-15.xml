		<content> WE WENT OVER THE FIELD TO THE BENNETT 
 FARM.  WHEN WE GOT TO THE GATE MRS    
 BENNETT WAS THERE.  THE FIRST THING WE
 SAW WAS THE CALVES IN A STABLE AND    
 THEY DRANK MILK AND CALF CAKE.  THE   
 CALVES WERE BROWN AND WHITE.  WE SAW  
 HOW THE COWS WERE MILKED AND WE SAW   
 SOME MILK IN BIG CONTAINERS.  THE     
 HORSES WERE IN THE YARD.  ONE WAS     
 CALLED ROULETTE AND ONE WAS CHEWING   
 THE GATE.                             
 WE SAW A NEW GRASSMOWER AND WE SAW A  
 NEW TRACTOR.  WE WENT IN THE STRAW AND
 THEN WE PLAYED IN IT.  CHRISTIAN GOT  
 STUCK AND KEVIN GOT CHRISTIAN OUT AND 
 I ROLLED IN IT.
