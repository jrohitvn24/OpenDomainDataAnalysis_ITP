		<content> Old industries like mining and        
 railways have disappeared. New        
 industries are being encouraged to    
 come to our area by the building of   
 pre-fabricated business units. They   
 come complete with toilets and heating
 and come in all sizes, small enough   
 for a one person business, or large   
 enough for a small factory. We have a 
 new trading estate at Stella Gill on  
 the site of old railway sidings and it
 is still being added to. Most of the  
 industries are light industry, mainly 
 manufacturing. Here is a list of the  
 wide range of goods produced:- car    
 kits for home construction, kitchen   
 units, fibre glass panels, car tyres, 
 polythene bags, precision tools,      
 custom built motor bikes, soft toys,  
 Windows, Saunas, sports equipment,    
 mechanical transmissions. There are   
 also builders and various services.   </content>
