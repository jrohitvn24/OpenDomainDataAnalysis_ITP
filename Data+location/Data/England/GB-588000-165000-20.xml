		<content> The area under survey can best be     
 described as a working class area.    
 Most of the population either work    
 on a farm or at the Paper Mill. There 
 are a sprinkling of bank clerks,      
 commercial representatives and office 
 workers. With the exception of a few  
 living along the A249 at Bobbing there
 are virtually no professional class of
 inhabitant in this area north of      
 Sittingbourne. Along with the national
 trend there has been a significant    
 increase int he level of unemployment 
 in the area over the past three years.
