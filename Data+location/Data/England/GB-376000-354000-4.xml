		<title>04Alsager College</title>
		<content> The college consists of two sites:    
 Crewe and Alsager.The Alsager college 
 covers 70 acres.430 students live on  
 the site.The students come from all   
 over England,but 60% come from within 
 100 miles of Alsager.It has plenty of 
 sports facilities.There's a variety of
 clubs for the students to go to every 
 evening.The college is very important 
 to Alsager,because the students       
 provide business to the shops.Most    
 students chose Alsager college        
 because  it had the right kind of     
 subjects.They liked the position of   
 the college in Alsager,but some say it
 is too far from away from a city.The  
 students can use the sports facilities
 in their spare time.Some students live
 outside the college.Those who live    
 inside the college say that the living
 conditions are comfortable.
