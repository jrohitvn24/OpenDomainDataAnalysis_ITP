 Maltby Miners' Welfare Institute,or   
 the 'Stute'as it is locally known,    
 provides for the recreation and       
 entertainment of the members. Indoor  
 sports include dominoes,cards,darts,  
 snooker and pool. Sixteen other pubs  
 and clubs take part in competitions   
 with the 'Stute'. Outdoor sports      
 include bowls,football and cricket.   
 The club field is called the"main".   
 This is used for games,the miners'    
 gala and for whippet racing.          
 The 'Stute' is situated on Muglet Lane
 close to the Model Village. Many      
 miners live nearby and in the newer   
 estate of Birk's Holt,known as Scotch 
 Alley.                                
 Many miners gather at the 'Stute' for 
 a chat over a pint of beer at the end 
 of their shift. It is busy on pay day 
 when entertainment is provided.       </content>
