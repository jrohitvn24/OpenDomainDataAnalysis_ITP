During the war Mr. J.L. Carr was an    
R.A.F. photographer and then an        
intelligence officer in Africa. He     
moved to Kettering from Yorkshire 34   
years ago and became head of Highfields
School. He loved sport and played      
cricket for Kettering.  Because he     
loved drawing he has drawn 400 pictures
of Northants. In the Parish Church are 
three carvings he has sculptured out of
Weldon stone. As a teacher he loved    
children's sense of humour, history and
sport. After many years as a teacher he
left because he liked taking risks and 
wanted a change. He bacame an author   
and wrote several successful novels. 'A
Month in the Country' won the Guardian 
Fiction prize in 1980. Soon his latest 
book, Â£The Battle of Pollocks Crossing'
will be for sale.
