		<content>       WYBERTON COLTS                  
 Every Saturday morning at wyberton    
 playing field we play football.We play
 for a team called Wyberton Colts and  
 in the week or on Sunday afternoon we 
 play against other teams.The under 12 
 team are one of the best in England   
 because they won a national           
 tournament.                           
 We have just had some coaching by     
 Leicester city football club.         
 Wyberton playing field is also used   
 for other things.There are some swings
 and a roundabout  which the people    
 around there play on.The cub's hut is 
 not that far away and often they come 
 down to play games or practice their  
 sports.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
