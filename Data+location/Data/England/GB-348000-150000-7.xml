		<title>07LIFE ON A MENDIP DAIRY FARM</title>
		<content>                                       
{Life on Bristol Plain Farm is rigorous
  nd demanding . Dairy cattle require  
 constant daily attention and the      
 farmer has to be mobile in all weather
 so Land Rovers and tractors are vital 
 equipment . A typical day will start  
 at 0600 hours and finish at 1830      
 hours. Milking is carried out morning 
 and afternoons and a herdsman the only
 employee helps with this. Afternoons  
 usually involve the mending of fences 
 or walls, care of beef stock or the   
 repair of broken farm buildings. The  
 farmers family also work on the farm. 
 The family enjoy the peace and        
 quietness of this isolated spot but   
 have little leisure time. September   
 brings a brief rest but even so,the   
 farmer has only taken 3 holidays in 15
 years.
