		<title>07SAINT PETERS CHURCH CALOW</title>
		<content> The church was built in 1869 but the  
 steeple was added later.There are 6   
 bells,played by pressing wooden       
 levers.The stained glass windows have 
 pictures of Saints,like St.Nicolas,   
 St.Anne,St.Cecilia and St.Helena.One  
 window has a picture of a choir boy   
 and a boy scout.On the North Wall is a
 statue of St.George and at the back is
 a statue of St.Peter,the patron saint 
 of the church.The font at the back has
 a carved,wooden cover made in 1944.   
 Nearby is a small miners lamp to show 
 that this is a mining area.           
 The organ in the Chancel was first    
 used on Easter Day 1901.The ceiling in
 the Sanctuary is painted with pictures
 of God and His Lamb,meaning Wisdom and
 Peace.This faces East and is the      
 highest part of the church, nearest to
 God.
