		<content> Interview with the family  24/7/85    
 This farm is owner-occupied by        
 Mr.Bradbury, his wife and 2 sons who  
 both work on the farm.  At busy times 
 they also employ a contract labourer, 
 especially when they are busy silage  
 making.                               
 Their main outside contact is by      
 telephone.  The family also have a    
 television and video which is their   
 main source of entertainment.         
 Mrs. Bradbury is a committee member of
 the Kniveton Women's Institute. Mr.   
 Bradbury seldom leaves the farm,      
 except for the occasional whist drive,
 about four times a year,at a          
 neighbouring village.  He also attends
 the National Farmers' Union and       
 Grassland Meetings.  The family also  
 go to Agricultural Shows at Ashover   
 and Ashbourne.  They have one week's  
 holiday each year.                    </content>
