		<content>There are no towns or large villages.  
There is a concentration of housing    
only around the area of Barking Tye.   
Battisford Hall is the most impressive 
large house.                           
There are farm houses which are still  
at the centre of working farms while a 
number of houses described as "farms"  
are now residential only.              
There is some County Council housing   
and smaller private housing.           
Manor Farm (or ST. John's Manor Farm)  
has a part of the house which was once 
used by the Knights Templars.
