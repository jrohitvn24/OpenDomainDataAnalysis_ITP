 swimming. The twenty five to thirty   
 age group use the complex the most.The
 centre's strengths according to the   
 manager,are two big housing estates   
 nearby,and therefore a big catchment  
 area,and easy access. The centre is   
 flexible as they run thenselves.      
 On average people in the urban areas  
 watch television for 4-6 hours each   
 day. These were mainly old people,    
 housewives and we think an increasing 
 number of young unemployed.           </content>
