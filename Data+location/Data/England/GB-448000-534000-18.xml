		<title>18THE FISH HOUSE.</title>
		<content> In 1922 my Granda started in Pattison-
 's kipper house he was 15.He started  
 at 6am and he finished at 10 or 11pm  
 for 7 days a week and got Â£1.Three men
 and 14 girls worked there too.8am     
 till 9 they went home  for breakfast  
 then worked right through till night. 
 He had to wash big barrels of fish and
 fillet them ready to smoke,the herrin-
 gs were placed in troughs of pickle   
 and left for half an hour to soak.Then
 they were hung up high above a kiln.A 
 fire was made from oak chippings and  
 sawdust and left until they smoked,   
 then cured on racks.They used to do   
 bloaters,herrings,smocked haddock.The 
 fish were sent to Billingsgate Norway 
 and Scotland and sold by a German auc-
 tioneer.Every box had to be stamped   
 with the place that they were going   
 to.  Elizabeth Golden age 10
