		<title>18W.THURROCK POWER STATION</title>
		<content>  West Thurrock power station is by    
 Stoneness on the bank of the River    
 Thames in Essex.It is about one and a 
 half miles from Grays.It is also quite
 close to St. Clements church.The      
 church is connected with the          
 Canterbury Pilgrims.The pilgrims used 
 to cross the Thames by ferry here.    
  The coal which is held at West       
 Thurrock is transported by sea from   
 coalfields in Yorkshire and the North 
 East.The ships have a capacity of     
 between 4000 and 7000 tons.           
  There are two pylons which send      
 Electricity into the national grid.The
 pylons are 630 ft high and are placed 
 one on each side of the river.They are
 this high to stop the ships from      
 crashing in to them.They are also a   
 mile apart.
