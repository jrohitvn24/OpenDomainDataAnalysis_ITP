		<content> The land is mainly improved grassland 
 but there are some broadleaved        
 woodlands. In these oak is dominant,  
 supporting the richest diversity of   
 animal species, also beech, which is  
 faster growing and does not allow much
 ground cover, its thick foliage       
 stopping the light. Other important   
 broadleaves are ash and sycamore.     
 Beech and sycamore are both introduced
 species.                              
 Other ecologically significant areas  
 are the acidic marshy grasslands along
 the edges of streams, supporting      
 wetland species of plants and animals.
 The variety of vegetation in the      
 hedgerows is very important for       
 wildlife, providing shelter, food and 
 breeding grounds, also corridors along
 which they can travel undetected.     
 Red and roe deer frequent the         
 woodlands and buzzards nest locally.  </content>
