		<title>12Farming around Edingale</title>
		<content>   All the land in our project block is
 intensively farmed.The vast majority  
of the land is under arable crops but a
few of the farmers keep small herds of 
cattle for milk and a few have flocks  
of sheep.                              
   Nearly all the land in the block is 
farmed by six farmers and also there   
are eight County Council smallholdings 
up Pessall Lane.One farmer works about 
750 acres in the centre of the block.  
He grows wheat, barley, oil-seed rape  
and horse beans, with the help of his  
two sons and one other employee, and   
three tractors.About 250 acres of the  
land owned by another farm falls in our
block.Most of this is under cereals.   
Sometimes the farmers are unable to do 
all the harvesting themselves and so   
they hire contractors.The Grange       
 farm also fatten bull calves and keep 
sheep.                                 </content>
