		<title>08Local history Shepreth</title>
		<content> Mrs Daisy Plumb was born in Shepreth  
 and always lived in the same house;   
 many of the changes to Shepreth she   
 remembers. When she was small there   
 were 2 cement works, 4 pubs, 2        
 churches, 3 shops and 2 working mills.
 There used to be 36 glasshouses at    
 Willlers Mill Fish Farm. Shepreth used
 to have its own school with 70        
 children. When they got to 11 they    
 went to Foxton and went on strike till
 they were given solid tyre bikes.     
 Electricity came to Frog End in 1950, 
 water came in 1957, before then there 
 were 2 pumps, one at each end of the  
 the street. When Mrs Plumb was young  
 they brought food from Royston by     
 horse and cart not by cars.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
