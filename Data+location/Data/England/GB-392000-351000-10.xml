		<title>10A Visit to an Old House.</title>
		<content>   One of the oldest buildings in Endon
is Sutton House.Like many other        
properties it has been altered and     
added to by successive generations.The 
original structure is early sixteenth  
century.Embedded in this part are the  
remains of an early timber frame"cruck"
roof".The frame is made of oak and     
there are remains of wattle and daub in
the boundary wall between the timber   
frame section and a later stone built  
extension.There is a large inglenook   
fireplace and several mullioned        
windows.It is also heavily beamed and  
contains a fine Tudor hearth.In the mid
eighteenth century a completely new    
north wing was added with a Classical  
style doorway and sash windows.The     
house is named after the Sutton Family,
who were associated with Endon from the
sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. 
It is a "listed" building.             </content>
