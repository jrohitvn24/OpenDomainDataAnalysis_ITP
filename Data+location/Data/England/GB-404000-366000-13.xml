		<title>13Coatestown Cottage (Past)</title>

Hundreds of years ago Hollinsclough was
covered in forest.Laws were passed to  
allow people to make clearings and     
build their own cottages.People used   
gritstone,limestone and thatched roofs 
with heather.The people became         
owners.Nearly two hundred years ago a  
family called Harpur Crewe said "We'll 
repair your houses and put on stone    
roofs if you pay us rent". Later Harpur
Crewe inherited the land and the people
became tennants.The Coates family first
lived in Coatestown Cottage (it was    
then called the Cottage of Content).   
Then the Armett's came,after that our  
Great Grandma came and Great Auntie    
Lizzie.Grandad persuaded Auntie Lizzie 
to move because the house was falling  
down,and when we moved to Coatestown   
the house was tumbled down.
