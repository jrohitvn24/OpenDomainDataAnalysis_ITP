		<title>12EDUCATION IN 1985</title>
		<content>  Education for children in this area  
 began in the 1930's with schools at   
 Northchapel and Roundhurst. In the    
 1920's Roundhurst School amalgamated  
 with Lurgashall School.In September   
 1949 Lurgashall and Ebernoe Schools   
 amalgamated with Northchapel all age  
 school.In September 1950 this school  
 became Northchapel County Primary     
 School and children over the age of 11
 attended Midhurst Grammar School or   
 Midhurst Secondary Modern School.     
  In 1978 schools in this area were    
 again re-organised into a 3-tier      
 system of education.Northchapel School
 became a first school for children    
 from 5-10 years.                      
  Many children have long distances to 
 travel to school and the West Sussex  
 County Council has to provide         
 transport for those who live more than
 1.5 miles away from school.           </content>
