		<content>The area is served by automatic tele-  
phone equipment situated at Sudbury and
Lavenham.                              
Postal services provide one delivery a 
day although in some cases not until   
mid-day. Rural postmen are still a     
valued contact, and manage to maintain 
a service in all but the most severe   
weather conditions.                    
Parish noticeboards giving information 
on local affairs exist in the main     
settlements of the block but there are 
none within it.                        
A branch library exists in Lavenham and
a mobile van visits nearby population  
centres.  This service is available to 
the residents of the block.            
Two large land-holdings have access to 
farming related computer services.
