		<content>   Most of the recreation in           
 Scremerston is created by the people  
 themselves. For the younger ones there
 is a{Youth Club}which meets twice a   
 week in the school.For the older ones 
 there is an{Indoor Bowling Club}which 
 meets twice a week during the         
 winter-time and they hold regular     
 whist drives, bingo sessions and      
 domino evenings. Some of the ladies   
 belong to the{Women's Institute}where 
 they can learn handicrafts, listen to 
 different speakers,hold there own     
 social evenings or visit other        
 Institutes in the vicinity.           
    Hobbies mainly consist of gardening
 for there are many keen gardeners in  
 the village.Indoors at the local pub  
 people are able to play darts or      
 dominoes or just even spend an evening
 talking to their friends.
