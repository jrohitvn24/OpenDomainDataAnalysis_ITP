		<title>10The Norman Church, Stoulton</title>
		<content>   The church has Norman arches and the
 windows are small because the cost of 
 glass in medieval times was expensive.
 One of the chancel windows shows a    
 woman spinning.                       
   Originally, the church had five     
 bells but when the tower was being    
 re-built, H.B. Kingsford increased    
 them to six as a gift to the church.  
 The largest of the bells weighs over  
 7 cwt.                                
   In the church grounds there is a    
 graveyard which includes many village 
 characters from the past - John       
 Blizzard  and his family of eleven    
 who died out in 1816.  Other famous   
 names include the Ewins, the Smithins 
 and the Hemus who have family graves  
 in the church yard.                   
   The Church is dedicated to St.      
 Edmund, King and Martyr. Its upkeep is
 expensive for a small community.      </content>
