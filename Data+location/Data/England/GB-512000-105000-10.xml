		<title>10HIGH SALVINGTON DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> This select,semi-rural village suburb 
 of Worthing is situated to the        
 North-West of Worthing,covering a 1.21
 km2 area with a Southerly aspect.High 
 Salvington has a high quality         
 environment,a low population density  
 and little noise and air pollution.It 
 has many trees,a large expanse of     
 downland,extensive hedged gardens.The 
 area has attracted the unwelcome      
 attention of developers,starved of    
 available building land within        
 Worthing.                             
 Well served by roads,through traffic  
 uses this area as a short cut from the
 A27 to the A24,benefiting only the    
 Salvington stores with passing trade. 
 with no schools,only one garage and   
 single intermittent bus service,the   
 future looks grim.Large houses        
 replaced by estates,trees uprooted,and
 the loss of a rare,rural ethos.       </content>
