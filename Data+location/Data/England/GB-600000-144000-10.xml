		<title>10 FARMING AROUND KENNINGTON</title>
		<content> The main type of farming in the{KEN-  
{NINGTON}area is arable; usually wheat,
 oats, rape and barley. Grass for hay  
 and grazing is also grown. Horti-     
 culture, farming of vegetables, is not
 very common in the area, and fields of
 horticultural crop are in the         
 minority. There are five farms in{    
{KENNINGTON: EASTWELL COURT, LENACRE   
{FARM, TOWER FARM, SANDYHURST FARM}    
 and{PARKBARN FARM.}At Eastwell Court  
 mainly arable crops are grown. Ducks  
 are bred at the duck farm for their   
 meat and eggs. Sandyhurst Farm grows  
 arable crops and also breeds cows and 
 sheep. Tower farm and Parkbarn Farm   
 both produce arable crops. Of course  
 not all non-residential land in the { 
{KENNINGTON}area is arable, about a    
 quarter of it is woodland although it 
 is rapidly decreasing because much is 
 being cut down for reidential purposes</content>
