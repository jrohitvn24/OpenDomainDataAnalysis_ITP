		<title>17Housing in and around Wistow</title>
		<content> The housing within this area is mainly
 confined to the villages of Little and
 Great Raveley and Wistow, apart from a
 few isolated farm houses.  The        
 Raveley's are both fairly small and   
 undeveloped apart from a little       
 in-filling.  However, Wistow has a    
 relativeley large number of modern    
 houses with two small estates being   
 built within the last l2 years and a  
 few houses being built on individual  
 plots.  All three villages have       
 council estates, built during the     
 l920's and modernised about 5 years   
 ago.  Some of these have been         
 purchased by the occupiers.  Many     
 older cottages have been modernised   
 and extended, retaining their old     
 world charm  with oak beams and       
 thatched roofs. Most buildings are of 
 conventional brick construction and   
 designed to fit in the rural location.</content>
