		<content>    Much has been done by the National 
Trust to restore Hughenden Manor as it 
was in Disraeli's time.Red distemper   
once more covers the walls of the Hall 
where the woodwork is again varnished  
and grained.When the new wooden floor  
was laid in the dining room because of 
wet mould,the remains of an Elizabethan
brick floor of the original farmhouse  
were found.In the renovation of the    
study in the winter of 1983-4 a        
Victorian photograph was copied to     
position furniture and old blocks were 
used to print the wallpaper.The        
furniture in here is all original.Soon 
the present tea-room is to be restored 
to its original use as "Dizzy's"       
bedroom.                               
    The house is filled with Disraeli  
memorablia including his "Gallery of   
Friendship" and the mourning note-     
paper used after the death of Mary-Anne</content>
