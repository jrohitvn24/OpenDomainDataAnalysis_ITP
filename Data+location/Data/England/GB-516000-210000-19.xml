		<content> Langley Wood is typical of            
 Hertfordshire woodland.There are      
 coppiced hornbeams,whose wood was sent
 to London for fire wood and oak which 
 was used for timber.The hornbeams were
 coppiced every 15 years.The oak trees 
 were cut after 150 years.Langley Wood 
 is ancient woodland because yellow    
 archangel and bluebells grow there.   
  Ancient woodland is wood that has not
 been disturbed since 1600.In May      
 inside the wood it is like a river of 
 bluebells.Maple trees, which are      
 native to Britain, grow in the wood   
 and also indicate its age. Lime trees,
 rare in woodland, are also found.     
 There is a boundary bank which was    
 built by a farmer to stop cattle      
 getting into the wood.There are many  
 spring flowering plants e.g.Dogs      
 Mercury,pignut,wood anenome.
