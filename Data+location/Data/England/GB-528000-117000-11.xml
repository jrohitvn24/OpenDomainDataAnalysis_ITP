		<content>    At 9am Joanne and I met outside    
 Superdrug for some shopping. We first 
 went to Gateway for some eggs, then to
 John Vokins for some cotton and then  
 bought some sweets.                   
   We walked home by 10 and watched    
 television, and then a video.         
   We went into the kitchen and made a 
 Victoria sandwich cake with chocolate 
 chips inside.We put it in the oven for
 30 minutes at mark 4. For dinner we   
 made ourselves cheese on toast and    
 spaghetti, as Mum was out at work.    
   In the afternoon we played Badminton
 in the garden, at 4pm we watched      
 children's television.                
   At 6 we had our tea, gammon steaks  
 and fresh peaches with strawberries   
 for afters. We then played upstairs on
 the computer. Joanne went for swimming
 training from 8.30 to 9.30.           
   I went home and was asleep by 11pm. </content>
