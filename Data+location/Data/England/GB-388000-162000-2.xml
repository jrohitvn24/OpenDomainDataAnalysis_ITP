		<title>02THE AVON       MELKSHAM</title>
		<content>   The Avon was established in Melksham
 in 1885.  There are 2292 men &amp; women  
 on the work force.  They make 5400    
 tyres a day for cars, motorbikes, and 
 lorries.  They also make golf grips   
 and parts for milking machines.  Six  
 lorries come into the Avon in a day   
 to collect tyres.  The Avon does not  
 own any lorries.  They hire them from 
 the British Road Service.  They export
 35% of their products.                
   They changed to coal as a fuel to   
 save money.  They supply tyres for    
 Rolls Royce, Bentley, Rover and       
 Bristol cars.  They forsee that there 
 will be no more money for machinery,  
 and therefore the workforce will drop 
 dramatically.
