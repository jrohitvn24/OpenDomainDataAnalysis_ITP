		<content> The main geology of the Havant area is
 based on chalk.To the west is a large 
 area of marshy land called{Farlington 
{Marshes}and rising to the north are   
 the{South Downs.}The landscape of     
 chalk allows water to seep through the
 ground,and come up again as springs.  
 The maximum height this area has is   
 the start of{Portsdown Hill-90m/300ft.
{Portsdown Hill}is a long chalk ridge, 
 overlooking Portsmouth.There is little
 remaining woodland in this area.The   
 Havant Gap is slowly diminishing      
 because of the need for housing,and   
 the A3M runs through it.The sea bed   
 is composed of sand,mud,and shingle,  
 with narrow channels at low tide.     
 Large areas of marshland have been    
 reclaimed from the north of Langstone 
 Harbour,this has been combined with   
 waste disposal and sewage works.
