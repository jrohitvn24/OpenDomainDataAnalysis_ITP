		<title>03THE SCHOOL POND</title>
		<content> One Thursday we made our school pond  
 more presentable and safer.Our teacher
 put us into groups to do different    
 jobs.Mr Heslop helped us because he   
 lived next to the school pond.One     
 group made a marsh area by dumping top
 soil into one edge then planting it   
 with marsh plants.Nico Brezan,Nicky   
 Heslop and Jonathan Markland took some
 of the duckweed off the surface of the
 pond.While we were doing this ,we     
 scooped two {Great Crested newts}which
 makes our pond and area of special    
 scientific interest.We all helped to  
 take some of the old fencing and roll 
 it up and put it into a pile.Some     
 people had to move some sticks and    
 branches to put on the pile.When we   
 had a big enough pile of rubbish,     
 leaves and twigs,we burnt them.
