		<content> The local public houses have the games
 darts, dominoes, cards and pool played
 in them and outside some there are    
 areas where children can be           
 entertained. Swings, slides and tables
 with benches being made available. At 
 the local club 'bingo'is played, also 
 live entertainment is provided at     
 weekends. At the Woeburn centre there 
 is a Youth Club where discos take     
 place. There is also a Nature Trail in
 the Vale which is a pleasant walk when
 the weather is fine. On Sundays there 
 is an informal gathering of children  
 with a religious bias in the church   
 hall as opposed to a formal service.
