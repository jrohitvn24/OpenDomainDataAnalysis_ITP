		<title>19Superstitions in Maltby</title>
		<content> Many people are,it seems,quite        
 superstitious. Also there are one or  
 two local legends. One of these       
 legends is about the White Lady of the
 Comprehensive School. It is said that 
 there once was a girl walking down the
 school clock tower steps when she     
 tripped and fell to her death. It is  
 now said that when the clock strikes  
 midnight, the White Lady walks the    
 corridors of the school.There are many
 superstitions,which include the more  
 common ones about the bad luck which  
 may be incurred by putting new shoes  
 on the table,or opening umbrellas in  
 the house. It is said to be unlucky to
 cross people on the stairs but it is  
 considered lucky to have a peacock's  
 feather. However,if crows are perched 
 on a house,it is a sign of imminent   
 death! Many people in Maltby know many
 superstitions,and always keep to them.</content>
