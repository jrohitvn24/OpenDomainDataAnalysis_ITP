		<title>06HEALTH CARE SEAHOUSES</title>
		<content>  In Seahouses we are well looked after
 by medical people based at the Health 
 Centre in James Street.               
  There are two practices with eight   
 doctors between them, one based in    
 Belford and the other in Embleton.    
  There is a District Nurse who is also
 a Midwife, but, almost all babies are 
 born in hospital because we are a long
 way from help if anything goes wrong. 
  Also based at the Health Centre are, 
 an assistant nurse, a Health Visitor  
 and assistant, a Physiotherapist,     
 three Bathing Attendants, eight Home  
 Helps and a Chiropodist.              
  A Child Clinic is held once a        
 fortnight, a Baby Clinic once a week  
 and there are ante natal, parent craft
 and relaxation classes.               
  A nurse is always on call 24 hours a 
 day seven days a week.
