		<title>05 HISTORY OF KENNINGTON-1</title>
		<content>                                       
 Since the original {DOMESDAY BOOK,}   
 Kennington has grown in size. It was  
 originally a very small Saxon settle- 
 ment with primitive tracks which      
 during Norman times progressed to     
 three streets:{BALL LANE, THE STREET} 
 and{ULLEY ROAD}which can be seen in { 
{1985.}In early years, {KENNINGTON}was 
 famous for {WILLOW TREES}which were   
 used to make Willow baskets. The      
 horses had no mains water and most    
 large houses had a well. {KENNINGTON} 
 has had various names since the       
 original Domesday Book, varying from {
{CHINTON}in 1072 AD, {CHENETONE}in 1086
 AD, {KENINTUNA}in 1157 AD, {KENINGTON 
 in 1254 AD and then {KENNINGTON}in    
 1610 AD, which is how it is spelt in  
 1985. In the past{KENNINGTON}and the  
 nearby village of {WYE}were sworn     
 enemies.                              </content>
