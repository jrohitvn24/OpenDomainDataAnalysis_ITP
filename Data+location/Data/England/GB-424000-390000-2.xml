		<title>02ANIMALS &amp; BIRDS.</title>
		<content> This area bounds with life of many    
 kinds.The moorlands are the home of   
 foxes,badgers,mountain hares,rabbits  
 stoats,weasels &amp; smaller mammals such 
 as shrews,voles &amp; mice.Probably the   
 most common mammal is the Pygmy Shrew 
 There are even some wallabies which   
 were released during the last war.    
 They are rarely seen as they move     
 amongst the bracken.It is believed    
 that their numbers have been reduced  
 to about eleven because of bad        
 winters &amp;the weakening effect of in-  
 breeding.Many birds make their home   
 here from resident red grouse on the  
 moors,herons by the reservoirs,       
 various members of the tit family in  
 the woods,to the migratory birds      
 coming here for the summer such as    
 redstarts,warblers &amp;cuckoos.
