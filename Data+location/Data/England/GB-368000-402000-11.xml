		<content> find the true meaning of life.        
    Essentially the{church exists to   
{provide for the spiritual needs of its
{parishioners.}However Rev.Bull feels  
 that{the church of the future needs to
{be more involved in the local         
{community.} Consequently, the church  
 organises groups for 1) young people  
 2) men's groups and 3) womens unions. 
    Lay people lead prayers and read   
 lessons as well as raise money        
 (Â£28,000 is needed per year).         
    The vicar believes{the church      
{should speak out}aganist human        
 injustice and therefore have a voice  
 in political affairs e.g unemployment 
 without being affiliated to any       
 political party.
