		<title>06GREAT MEOLS:THE CHURCH.</title>
		<content>{St.John The Baptist,Parish Church.    
 Evening services are recorded as first
 being held at Great Meols School(1880)
 and by 1899 morning services were     
 approved by the Vicar of Hoylake. In  
 December,1900, a building committee   
 was elected and,at a cost of Â£500,a   
 temporary church was erected prior to 
 that of a permament place of worship. 
 However Meols was growing in size and 
 the temporary church was  inadequate. 
 Fund raising activities+loans enabled 
 the consecration of the present church
 on the 12/4/1913 by the Lord Bishop of
 Chester.Only the Tower,Lady Chapel and
 Sanctuary remaining to be built.      
 The church was finally completed after
 its Jubilee Year of 1963.             
 The present vicar is the Rev.Pritchard
 B.Eng.                                
 THe church has a capacity for 400 and 
 attracts a congregation of 170. {     </content>
