		<content>                                       
The farm work varies considerably  from
season  to  season. In the  Autumn  the
main  jobs  include  ploughing,  hedge-
cutting  and sowing. Young  cattle  are
taken  to be sold at one of  the  local
markets.   At  the  start  of   Winter,
usually in November, silage is cut. The
main  Winter work is farm  maintenance,
particularly  of outbuildings,  ditches
and machinery.                         
Spring  tasks  include  maintenance  of
outbuildings, ditches and machinery. In
the  summer the farm is very  busy.  In
addition  to  the  normal  feeding  and
looking  after stock which takes  place
all  year,  important jobs  are  silage
making, hay making and corn harvesting.
