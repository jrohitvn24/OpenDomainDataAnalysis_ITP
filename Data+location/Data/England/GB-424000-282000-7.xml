		<title>07Meriden-Farming.</title>
		<content> As Meriden is essentially a rural     
 area, farming is very important. The  
 land in this area is highly farmed,   
 being used for both crops and cattle. 
                                       
{Mixed farming}is practised on most of 
 the farms in the area, and the milk   
 produced is supplied to dairies in the
 nearby cities of Birmingham and       
 Coventry.                             
                                       
{Grass}is grown and cut for both hay   
 and silage, cereal crops are grown as 
 well as root crops such as potatoes.
