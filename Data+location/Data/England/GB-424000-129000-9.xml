 owned by Mr.J.Coggan.There are sixteen
 well bred brood mares and nine foals.

 stallions to France or even America.  
 The brood mares here are Thoroughbred.
 The foals are sold when they are      
 yearlings.They are sold at{NEWMARKET} 
 and put in special paddocks with NO   
 barbed wire.In 1954 one of the foals  
 from this Stud went for {Â£23,000}but  
 was soon exceeded by {Â£30,000}.The    
 yearlings are given their names with  
 new owners .The foals are born between
