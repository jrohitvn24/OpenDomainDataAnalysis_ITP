		<content>{Family life}is important and forms a  
 closely knit community. Farming       
 families work together and children   
 seldom suffer from boredom.  Many     
 people keep pets: dogs, cats, rabbits,
 ponies, guinea pigs, ferrets, birds,  
 and one man breeds Shire Horses.  As  
 all the houses have{sizeable gardens, 
 flower, fruit and vegetable growing is
 a favourite pastime.Crafts, sports and
 dancing are some of the many hobbies. 
 Home produce is frozen or preserved   
 and many families enjoy weekends      
 picnicking, walking and picking local 
 wimberries, blackberries, nuts and    
 mushrooms.{'Home' cooking and baking  
{is still preferable to 'convenience   
{foods',}though 'cooked' breakfasts are
 not eaten as often now.  Cars,(driven 
 at 17), are a necessity. The majority 
 of families work hard, play hard and  
 live life happily to the full.        </content>
