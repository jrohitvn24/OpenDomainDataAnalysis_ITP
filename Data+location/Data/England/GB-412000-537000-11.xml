		<content>{ Tow Law Town A.F.C. play in the 1st. 
{Division of the Northern League. Home 
{games attract many supporters.        
  The new leisure-centre at Willington 
 (5 miles) and the swimming pool at    
 Crook (4 miles) are both within easy  
 reach.                                
{ In Tow Law there are allotments which
{are looked after by young and old     
{alike and there are still pigeon crees
{on some of them.Older people also meet
{to play darts, dominoes, whist, etc.  
{and there are monthly meetings for the
{Mother's Union and the W.I.           
  The Church Lad's/Girl's Brigade meets
 once a week as do the Brownies and    
 Girl-Guides (a new venture). There is 
 also a Youth Club but the demolition  
 of the Community Centre has stopped   
 many activities.However the new B.M.X.
 track is very popular.                
                                       </content>
