		<content> The dominant mature trees in this     
 patch of woodland covering the banks  
 of a small stream consist of ash,     
 sycamore and silver birch.There were  
 originally elm trees in the wood but  
 ten of these now stand dead or dying. 
 The mature trees are nearly all acting
 as hosts to ivy plants which surround 
 the trunks and climb to the highest   
 branches.The wood also contains a few 
 specimans of holly,hawthorn,elder and 
 Norway spruce.At the edges of the wood
 dog-rose,cherry and bramble may be    
 found.Part of the wood has recently   
 been felled;replanting with           
 ash,sycamore,mountain ash,cherry and  
 at least one copper beech has now     
 taken place.These new trees are       
 protected from rabbits and deer by    
 corrugated plastic tubes.
