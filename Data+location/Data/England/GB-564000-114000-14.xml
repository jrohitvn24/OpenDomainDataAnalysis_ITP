 The highlight of the Bodle Street year
 is probably the church fete held in   
 the gardens of a local farm - very    
 picturesque on a June afternoon. The  
 flower show held in August is the     
 pinnacle of the gardening year and the
 club dinner held in February starts   
 off the season. You can be certain of 
 delicious food at the Harvest Supper  
 and the exchange of news and views    
 with old friends.  Carol singing round
 the village is a happy event for young
 and old alike.  Coffee mornings,      
 jumble sales, Christmas Fayres also   
 play a part in the village life of    
 both Bodle Street and Ashburnham      
 although most of the events for       
 Ashburnham are held outside the       
 immediate area at Ashbournham Place.
