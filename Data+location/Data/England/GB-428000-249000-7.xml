 ing,squash and badminton.Animals also 
 play an important part in peoples     
 lives i.e.dogs,and horses.Womens      
 Institute,brownies,scouts and         
 guides,and Duke of Edinbrough award

{Area of Workplace.}A small number     
 actually worked in the "D Block",and  
 those were almost entirely connected  
 with the land. The vast majority      
 worked in Kineton,Wellesbourne ,or    
 more likely Stratford. Royal          
 Leamington Spa or Banbury.Even the    
 children had to travel outside the    
 area for their education,mainly to    
 Kineton,but also to Stratford.
