		<title>14SPECIAL EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS</title>
		<content>     Two schools have special educat-  
ional units on their site.  Kingsley   
School has a partially hearing unit for
4-11 year olds. The unit has equipment 
so the children can have lessons in    
their own classrooms and join in less- 
ons in the main school.   If there are 
some children in other schools who need
help because they have hearing diffic- 
ulties, teachers can get help and      
advice from Kingsley. An Oralographic  
Unit is also based at Kingsley; this is
for children who have reading problems 
      The children go  to the unit     
every day for one hour until the course
has finished, then they are able to    
return to the classroom. West Thornton 
School has two special units, one for  
gipsy children, and one for children   
with speech problems.  Children can    
join this unit at any age and stay     
until their speech has improved.       </content>
