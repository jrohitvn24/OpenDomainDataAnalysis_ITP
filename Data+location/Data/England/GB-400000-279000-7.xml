LOT OF VEGETATION AND IT IS VERY       
GREEN.THERE ARE LOTS OF SHRUBS AND     
TREES.ALL THE PARKS ARE OPEN AND THERE 
ARE LOTS OF PLACES TO RUN AROUND.THE   
GARDENS ARE NOT FENCED AND THERE ARE NO
BRICK WALLS TO SEPARATE THE FOOTPATH   
FROM THE GARDEN.THE ROADS IN BOURNVILLE
ARE FAR WIDER THAN ALL THE OTHER ROADS 
ELSEWHERE.GEORGE CADBURY MADE THE      
HOUSES DIFFERENT FROM  ONE ANOTHER.THE 
HOUSES IN BOURNVILLE ARE NOT CROWDED   
TOGETHERBUT ARE SPACED OUT.
