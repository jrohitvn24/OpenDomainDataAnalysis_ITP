		<content>{ Wavin Plastics}built a new factory in
 Chippenham which was opened in 1983 by
 Princess Anne. Children from local    
 primary schools were to the opening of
 what is a very modern business.       
  In the factory they employ about two 
 hundred people making and selling     
 plastic pipes and fittings for the    
 building industry. These include      
 rainwater gutters, water pipes and    
 plumbing fittings.                    
  The machines in the factory never    
 stop working, so there are people     
 working there twenty four hours a day 
 seven days a week. This means that a  
 lot of those who work at Wavin have to
 work on shifts. The shift workers in  
 the factory can earn about Â£150 a week
 while day workers earn about Â£100 a   
 week.
