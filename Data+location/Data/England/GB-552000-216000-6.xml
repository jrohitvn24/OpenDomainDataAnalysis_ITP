		<content>   One of the most interesting things  
 about the central part of the village 
 near the church is the knowledge that 
 it has altered very little during the 
 past four hundred years since the     
 dissolution of the monastery in 1534. 
 Old photographs and descriptions      
 confirm this. Even the past fifty     
 years of rapid change have left its   
 general character unspoilt.           
   A detailed description of the area  
 in 'The Regional Survey of Hatfield   
 Broad Oak' (1928) by Mrs. Annie R.    
 Hatley speaks of the 'red roofs of the
 town' looking 'particularly attractive
 across the valley of the Mus Brook.'  
 She notes 'the well-wooded skyline'   
 and writes with enthusiasm about the  
 general panoramic view to be obtained 
 from the church tower as being 'well  
 worth the labour of climbing the      
 stairs'. See Photograph 'A'.          </content>
