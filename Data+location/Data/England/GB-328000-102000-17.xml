 for farming and grazing Freisan cattle
 Much of the land is rented but very   
 few acres are owned,by the            
 Farmers.Sheep graze on some of the    
 land.In Parks down in the Kit valley  
 it is mostly Woodland and is used for 
 rough grazing.In the Summer the cattle
 farmers make hay and silage for feed  
 in the Winter.Some corn for feed is   
 grown.Some low lying Marshy land is   
 damp and unuseable.Many of the hedges 
 have been pulled down and the strip   
 fields incorporated into larger       
 fields.Small areas are used for       
 housing &amp; light Industry-food         
 processing.Some old quarries are used 
 for rubbish dumping.
