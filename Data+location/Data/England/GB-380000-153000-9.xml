		<title>09Education in Southwick.</title>
		<content> There are many more chidren in        
 Southwick than Rode and the playgroup 
 meets every morning. Southwick C of E 
 Primary School has about 180  pupils  
 aged 5 to 11. The boys and girls come 
 from Southwick, Trowbridge and North  
 Bradley. There are 6 classes and a    
 non-teaching headmaster. The Church   
 of England is represented on the      
 School Board and has influence on the 
 school curriculum. Southwick is in    
 Wiltshire, so the education policy    
 differs widely from that practised in 
 Rode, which is controlled by Somerset 
 Education Authority. When children    
 reach 11 they go to John of Gaunt     
 Comprehensive School, Trowbridge until
 they are 16 or older. The admission   
 procedure is also different at        
 Southwick school; pupils start school 
 in the term, rather than the year, in 
 which they are 5.                     </content>
