		<content>Whilst vandalism is the biggest problem
in the Bretch Hill area of Banbury     
there are other things which are       
common. Children steal regularly from  
the local shops, and adults break into 
gas meters. People also leave their    
back doors open and then pop out for a 
few minutes giving the opportunist     
thief time to get in and out again.    
Bicycles are also stolen and the police
have introduced a marking system where 
the postcode of the owner is stamped on
the frame.                             
There are also about fifteen children  
between the ages of 14 and 17 who sniff
glue. They tend to use the Folly near  
the Wroxton Estate and the spinney at  
the back of Harlech Close, Bretch Hill.
There is no law to stop the children   
doing this and so it is difficult to   
deal with. There are also a small      
number of people taking drugs.         </content>
