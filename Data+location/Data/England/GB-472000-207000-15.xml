		<title>15A day for Sam in Haddenham.</title>
		<content> I woke at 7am. I read my reading book 
 "The Silver Sword". Then I went down  
 to watch Popeye. I got ready for      
 school and got my music ready. At     
 school I found out that Mrs Blade had 
 not come because her baby was ill.    
 After assembly we were taught by Mrs  
 Thorogood and we wrote a newspaper    
 report about the Bernewode Games. I   
 wrote about the Chinese Cricket match 
 and my team lost. Then it was         
 playtime. After that I did my group   
 sports day picture of the teachers    
 having sponges thrown at them. My     
 group made a mess of our picture but  
 that was soon fixed. We went home at  
 3.15. When my sister Victoria got home
 I went to watch the television and    
 had my tea. Later I went to play      
 rounders with her. 2 hours later I    
 went to bed and did things like       
 reading and knitting.                 </content>
