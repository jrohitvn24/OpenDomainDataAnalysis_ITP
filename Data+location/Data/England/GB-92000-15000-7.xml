		<title>07PHONES ON ST.MARTINS I.O.S</title>
		<content> Telephones have only been on the      
 islands since 1928.Since then 31 out  
 of 35 homes on St.Martins have been   
 connected.Recently,on the 16th April  
 1984 a new electronic exchange costing
 half a million pounds was opened on   
 St.Marys.There are two telephone      
 engineers on the main island of       
 St.Marys,one for the exchange and the 
 other for general work on the off     
 islands.                              
   Most boats have ship to shore radios
 which can be used to call up Falmouth 
 Coastguard in emergencies,but they    
 are more often used to talk to each   
 other.Even by dialling 999 you get    
 Falmouth,as they deal with Scillonian 
 emergency calls. On St.Martins the    
 four man fire crew and the eleven     
 Auxilliary Coastguards,would rely on  
 radio contact in any rescue attempts. 
 Regular practices take place for both.</content>
