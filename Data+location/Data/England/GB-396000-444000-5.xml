		<content> The closure of the mine               
 _______________________               
 The mine ceased to be productive in   
 1869 with the raising of 130 tons.    
 William Hudson took the job of        
 caretaker when the mine started to be 
 run on a care and maintainance        
 basis.Lead was only mined to meet     
 orders after 1869. For example in 1871
 12 tons were mined, and three years   
 later in 1874 20 tons were mined.     
 Nothing was mined during the period   
 in between.                           
 When the mine closed a few small      
 companies began to mine for barytes,  
 which was once a waste product but is 
 used today in the paper and rubber    
 industry as a filling agent.          
                                       
 Restoration work is now being         
 undertaken by{Earby Mine Museum.}
