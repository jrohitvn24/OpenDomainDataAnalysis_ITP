		<title>10Devon Lanes</title>
		<content> Many of the roads in our area are     
 single track lanes.  They are quite   
 narrow and quite twisty.              
                                       
 On either side of the lane there is   
 usually a hedge.  The bottom part of  
 the hedge is made of stone and earth. 
 There is no cement and mortar, so the 
 wall is known as a{dry-stone}wall.    
 This walling is built and kept up by  
 the local farmers.  Re-building fallen
 dry-stone walling is very skillful,   
 and very hard work.                   
                                       
 Lots of{wild plants}grow in the bank  
 and this covers the whole wall with a 
 blanket of pretty flowers.  People on 
 holiday sometimes find that the banks 
 are much harder than they look when   
 they bump into them in their cars!
