		<title>15FARMING -HOUGHTON ESTATE</title>
		<content> Approximately one third of this area  
 is farmed by a tenant farmer.Most of  
 the land is used for arable crops     
 including wheat, barley, rye, sugar   
 beet, grass, carrots and potatoes.At  
 the present time there are also 4O    
 cattle, but this varies from time to  
 time. Five men are employed using     
 tractors, ploughs, cultivators,       
 harrows, rolls, corn drills, hoes,    
 sprayers, and sugar beet drills.At    
 harvest time combine harvesters,      
 balers and fork lift loaders are      
 used.Some chemicals are used- in      
 Autumn a pre-emergent herbicide       
 against weeds, and in Spring a post   
 emergent hormone weedkiller, and some 
 fungicides.Very occasionally aerial   
 spraying of chemicals is undertaken,  
 but only if the ground is too wet.    
 The soil is a mixture of sand on chalk
 and sandy loam on chalk.              </content>
