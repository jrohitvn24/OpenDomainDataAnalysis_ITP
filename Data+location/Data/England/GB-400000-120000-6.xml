		<title>06FARMERS' ATTITUDES</title>
		<content> "This is so peaceful: all species of  
 birds are here and many varieties of  
 butterfly. Of course, most of us here 
 are not typical farmers having other  
 financial interests".                 
 "The pressures of farming are         
 increasing, they are like those facing
 any other business man. I have never  
 been employed but it seems to me that 
 these stresses are quite unlike those 
 of a salaried professional man".      
 "My concern is to prevent change. How 
 do I influence Planners to avoid      
 development threatened near the main  
 road? The Hampshire Trust for Nature  
 Conservation has just succeeded in    
 purchasing one such area but          
 developers are seeking other sites    
 nearby". "Here, its just like England 
 used to be: that is why we chose it.  
 We're disgusted with the attitudes of 
 the BBC over blood sports".           </content>
