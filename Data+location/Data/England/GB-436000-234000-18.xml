		<title>18AERIAL VIEWS OF THE D-BLOCK</title>
		<content> COURTESY OF A PARENT, MR.RAY BOND, 5  
 OF THE DOMESDAY TEAM WERE ABLE TO FLY 
 OVER THE D-BLOCK AND TAKE AERIAL      
 PHOTOGRAPHS. IN PARTICULAR WE ENJOYED 
 THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN A SMALL    
 PLANE, VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND AND   
 YET FAR ENOUGH AWAY TO SEE THE WHOLE  
 BLOCK AT ONCE. TAKING THE PHOTOGRAPHS 
 WAS HARD AS YOU HAD TO KEEP THE CAMERA
 VERY STILL AND NEAR THE GLASS OF THE  
 WINDOW, NOT EASY WHEN YOU ARE BEING   
 THROWN ABOUT BY TURBULENCE. THE ROMAN 
 FORT OUTLINE WAS VERY CLEAR ON        
 USHERCOME FARM AND YOU COULD SEE VERY 
 FAINT PARTS ON THE TADMARTON GOLF     
 COURSE. SCHOOL LOOKED VERY SMALL AND  
 INSIGNIFICANT FROM UP ABOVE IN THE    
 CLOUDS BUT BROUGHTON CASTLE LOOKED    
 MAJESTIC AND THE MOAT WAS VERY BLUE. A
 GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR CAROLINE BOND,   
 JOCASTA CROFTS, STUART HUDSON, CARADOC
 GLAISYER &amp; ADEMOLA FORSYTHE.          </content>
