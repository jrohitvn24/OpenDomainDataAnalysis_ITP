		<content> Our Domesday project area covers a    
 large area of{mixed farmland.}This    
 farmland belongs to 4 overall land    
 owners, who run their farms from one  
 central farm. Most of the farmers in  
 this area are{mixed arable}and        
{livestock,}the arable land being      
 mainly{forage crops,}and the          
 livestock,{cattle,sheep and pigs.     
 There are also, dotted about the      
 area,several{woods}with mixed         
{coniferous}and{deciduous}trees.{Eston 
{Bank}belongs to Langbaurgh Council and
 is used by the public for many{leisure
{activities.}There is evidence along   
 the Eston Bank hill line of disused   
{ironstone mines,}and{quarries}dating  
 back to the early 1900's when this was
 a hive of{industrial activity.}Due to 
 this activity some of the farmers have
 had to change from crops to{grazing   
 due to{subsidence}from old workings.  </content>
