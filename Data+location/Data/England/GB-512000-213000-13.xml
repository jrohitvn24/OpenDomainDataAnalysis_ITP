		<title>13The Post Office Harpenden</title>
		<content> We were surprised when visiting the   
 Post Office sorting area to find the  
 Bicycle Room. 50 postmen, 4 postwomen 
 deliver up to 200,000 letters weekly, 
 using Mail Vans and bikes.   Twenty   
 numbered bikes with a front rack to   
 hold the postbag are in daily use.    
 We visited a postman who has cycled   
 miles in his 28 years service.   Up at
 04.00, he starts work at 05.00 sorting
 the mail for his morning round.   He  
 thinks bikes are safer and quicker.   
 Modern letter boxes and dogs are the  
 postman's worst enemies.              
 He added that as Harpenden has grown  
 there are many more houses and post to
 deliver.   He remembers the chickens  
 running free in Roundwood Lane and    
 friendly chats with local people,     
 which he misses.   Nowadays although  
 still friendly people are too busy to 
 stop.                                 </content>
