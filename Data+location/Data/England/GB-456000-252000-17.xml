		<title>17RECREATION PRESTON CAPES</title>
		<content> Preston Capes being situated in a     
 rural area has no organised sports    
 facilities as such, although people   
 jogging around the villages can be    
 seen. Gardening seems to be a very    
 popular hobby judging by the beautiful
 gardens, as is walking the many public
 footpaths.                            
 There has been a Riding School in the 
 village for a number of years and     
 horseriding is a popular pastime      
 enjoyed by both young and old alike.  
 Both the Pytchley and Stowe Beagles   
 hunt in the area.
