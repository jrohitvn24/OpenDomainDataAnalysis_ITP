		<title>10MY JAM-PACKED DAY</title>
		<content> I woke up at 6.52am, when my alarm    
 went off. I was still half asleep. My 
 mum shouted at me to come downstairs. 
 It took me ages to get out of bed. I  
 went downstairs. It was 7.25am. I had 
 Shreddies and marmalade               
 sandwiches with a cup of tea. After   
 breakfast I went upstairs and wasted  
 time. Then I cleaned my teeth with    
 Colgate and Crest, mixed. I washed my 
 face and went to the loo. It was      
 7.45am.I got my swimming kit ready and
 put talc inside my hat then I stuffed 
 it all in a plastic bag. Then I got my
 homework ready. By that time it was   
 8.00am, my mum shouted at me to come  
 and get my piano practice done. My dad
 had already gone to work. I did my    
 practice with great difficulty as     
 Melissa my sister was playing her     
 recorder as well. When I finished it  
 was 8.30am                            </content>
