		<title>12Rothbury Music Festival</title>
		<content> In July we have a traditional music   
 festival which lasts for three days.  
 Musicians travel to Rothbury from all 
 over the United Kingdom and there are 
 competitions for adults and           
 schoolchildren.                       
 You can hear the Scottish bagpipes and
 the Northumbrian pipes and listen to  
 buskers who wander around the streets.
 There are also mummers plays and      
 people reading dialect poems. You can 
 see different kinds of folk dancing,  
 including sword dancing.              
 Children from our school and the first
 school take part in competitions and  
 win prizes.                           
 on the Saturday of the festival there 
 are competitions in our school and the
 first school which is on the other    
 side of the village. Over the weekend 
 there are many strangers around.
