		<content>{ROMAN RIVER VALLEY AND                
{LAYER-DE-LA-HAYE}- The valley covers  
 about eight square miles of           
 countryside to the south of           
 Colchester.Great efforts have been    
 made to safeguard the natural         
 resources of the Roman River whilst   
 satisfying the interests of           
 agriculture,forestry,military         
 training,sport and recreation.The     
 village of Layer mentioned in the     
 original Domesday Book has retained   
 its identity despite its nearness to  
 Colchester.                           
 The building of Abberton Reservoir    
 brought about considerable changes in 
 land ownership and usage during the   
 1930's.The Water Treatment Works      
 helped to create new jobs in the      
 area,and the Reservoir has provided   
 increased opportunity for recreation.
