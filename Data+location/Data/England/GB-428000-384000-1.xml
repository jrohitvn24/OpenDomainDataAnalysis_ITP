		<title>01General Description</title>
		<content>      Our area lies on the western edge
 of the city of Sheffield, on an area  
 previosly given over to rough pasture 
 land and adjoining moorland.          
   The area lies between 600 and 800   
 feet above sea level, therefore winter
 conditions of snow and ice make it a  
 vulnerable site for communications.   
   The major part of the housing estate
 is twenty years old and almost        
 exclusively owner occupied.           
 Approximately 10% of the area is made 
 up of housing built between the wars  
 and isolated farms trace their history
 back over 200 years. Two major        
 features of the area are Lodge Moor   
 Hospital, formally a fever hospital   
 built well away from inhabited sites  
 and now specialising in spinal        
 injuries and the Hallamshire Golf     
 Course which dominates the northern   
 section of the block. {               </content>
