		<title>18FLAXLEY HAMLET.</title>
		<content> The hamlet of {Flaxley }is at the     
 extreme western end of our area. It   
 lies between the main roads through   
 Westbury-on-Severn and Micheldean,in  
 the {Vale of Castiard}. There are only
 a handful of houses and the population
 is about 50. The village school closed
 in 1910. It had opened in 1848 as     
 a church of England school and it     
 shows clearly the decline of rural    
 population. The school room is still  
 used for some meetings, like the W.I. 
 The church of St Mary the Virgin acts 
 as a centre for community life. Each  
 year a successful village fete is held
 to raise funds for the church. There  
 is now a youth club, but there is     
 neither pub nor Post Office. There    
 was a Cistercian Abbey here in 1148,  
 this is now a private house. It is    
 thought that flax may have been       
 processed here, hence the name.       </content>
