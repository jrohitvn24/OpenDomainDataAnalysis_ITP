		<title>02Manor farm, Landford</title>
		<content> Manor farm Landford is up Stock Lane  
 just off the A36 by Landford Manor.The
 farmer has owned the farm since 1950, 
 35 years altogether.It is a farm      
 mainly for cows but other animals are 
 there.He keeps 190 cows and 2         
 bulls,and 55 calves about 9 months    
 old.He can only keep a certain number 
 of cows because he can only give a    
 certain amount of milk to Unigate in  
 Southampton.In the morning one of the 
 workers rounds up the cows on a       
 motorbike and they all go to be       
 milked.One of the cows is the thinnest
 but it gives the most milk.One cow    
 usually  gives 21 or 22 litres of milk
 a day.We saw 2 big tanks which        
 altogether hold 4000 litres of milk in
 one day.The cow is pregrant for 280   
 days or 9 months.The birth can be     
 short if all goes well.
