		<title>15Community Police in Frimley</title>
		<content>   A policeman's job in Frimley is     
 different from that of a Metropolitan 
 policeman. He tries to help various   
 groups of the community in their      
 special needs, mainly by walking the  
 beat and by visiting people,          
 especially the elderly.               
   Other problems may arise, such as   
 chasing up information on burglaries  
 or controlling traffic in the rush    
 hour periods. On night shift he often 
 needs to be on hand to cope with      
 people who have drunk too much. We    
 also have a policeman in each area who
 is responsible for contact with       
 children and teachers in schools.     
   He works long hours and aims to     
 tackle any problems efficiently, but  
 in a friendly manner. Often crime is  
 prevented because he has built up a   
 special relationship with people in   
 his area.                             </content>
