		<title>08THE SCHOOL AT SALESBURY.</title>
		<content>   The first part of the present School
 was built in 1850,but in 1888         
 financial difficulties caused it to   
 close.The amount of teaching varied   
 with the prosperity of the parish :   
 farmer's children,as in 1985,were more
 useful helping at home than learning  
 at school.In 1898 it reopened with 70 
 scholars.However,when the Orphanage   
 opened at Wilpshire in 1892,it was    
 found necessary to enlarge the School 
 - this was done 3 times before 1914.  
 During the "baby boom" of the 1960's 3
 Infant classrooms,a Hall,Staffroom,   
 Kitchen and cloakrooms with toilets   
 were installed.                       
   In 1985 Salesbury,St.Peter's,School 
 has 205 pupils betwen the ages of 5   
 and 11.The curriculum is as wide as   
 possible and sporting events flourish 
 on the 1 1/2 acre field and in the    
 local swimming baths.                 </content>
