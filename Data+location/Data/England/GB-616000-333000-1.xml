		<content> Theresa writes about our area.It is a 
 rural part of East Anglia.Aldborough  
 is the main village centred around a  
 pretty Green.It is 18 miles from      
 Norwich and 6 miles from Cromer.It is 
 a farming area with 2 more small      
 villages Wickmere and Hanworth.The    
 Scarrow Beck drains the fields and    
 scattered about are small patches of  
 mixed woodland.Aldborough has become a
 popular village for people who work in
 Norwich and many old cottages and     
 other buildings have been converted   
 into modern housing.There is a lively 
 village feeling with various          
 activities happening.There is now just
 one school for the area at Aldborough-
 the children from outlying parts being
 brought in by bus.Although things have
 changed greatly this century it is    
 still very much rual part of England.
