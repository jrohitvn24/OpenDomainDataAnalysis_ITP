		<title>03  An Interesting person</title>
		<content>   We decided to interview an          
 interesting person. We chose the      
 ticket collector on Birnbeck Pier.    
   We went down to the pier and asked  
 him some questions.First we asked him 
 the age of the pier.He said that the  
 pier was 123 years old.Queen Victoria 
 opened the pier in 1862.              
   There is a man at the pier who has  
 been working there for ten years and  
 his nick name is Jones the            
 Toll.There is an old man who has      
 gone to the pier for the last seven   
 years.Jones the Toll photo copied a   
 page of a book all about the opening  
 of the pier.                          
   Then we asked him the length of the 
 pier.He said it is exactly a 1,000    
 feet long.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
