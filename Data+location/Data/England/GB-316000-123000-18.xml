		<title>18Local Government Structure</title>
		<content>   Somerset County Council forms the   
 top tier in the local government      
 structure.  It controls a wide range  
 of activities affecting the lives of  
 the people in this area.  These       
 include Education and the much        
 appreciated mobile library service.   
   The county is divided into five     
 districts and this area is within the 
 Taunton Deane District.  This council 
 has many responsibilities including   
 local roads, footpaths, leisure and   
 recreational facilities and planning. 
   Each district is divided into many  
 parishes and this area is partly in   
 Oake, Bradford-on-Tone and Norton     
 Fitzwarren.                           
   There are elected representatives at
 all levels of local government.       
 Members of parish councils have little
 power and serve mainly to discuss and 
 draw attention to local problems.     </content>
