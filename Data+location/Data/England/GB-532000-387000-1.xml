		<title>01Louth, Lincolnshire</title>
		<content> Louth,(pop.approx.13,000) is one of   
 Lincolnshire's smaller towns but      
 nevertheless a place of importance for
 agriculture and industry.It stands on 
 the River Lud on the eastern slopes of
 the Lincolnshire Wolds,overlooking    
 Marshland which extends 10 miles to   
 the east coast.Dominating the town is 
 the beautiful spire of the ancient    
 parish church-but this is only 1 of   
 many old and interesting buildings.   
 Situated in one of the most advanced  
 and productive farming areas of the   
 world,Louth is of course a market     
 town,retaining much of the tradition  
 of the rural community of which it is 
 a focal point.It does not,however,    
 dwell too much on the past,witness the
 bypass soon to be built,the industrial
 and trading estate developments now   
 well under way and the redevelopment  
 of its education system.f             </content>
