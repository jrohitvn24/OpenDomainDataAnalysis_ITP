		<content> This area is mostly country-side and  
 hilly with a few valleys.The          
 country-side is taken up because of   
 all the farms.They are mostly mixed   
 farms.There are lots of bed &amp;         
 breakfast places and quite a few      
 hotels.Some are only one minute walk  
 to the beach others are about 5 to 10 
 minutes away.The area has a low       
 population in the winter, with a quite
 high population for the area in the   
 summer.There's about 14 shops in the  
 area including a small museum and a   
 few pottery shops but half are closed 
 in the winter.There is one school in  
 Georgeham.The area is built up by     
 Georgeham, Croyde, Norh Buckland,     
 Darracott and Lobb with mostly rough  
 grazing in between the different      
 places or normal farmland.Less than   
 one thousand people live in the twelve
 square kilometres.                    </content>
