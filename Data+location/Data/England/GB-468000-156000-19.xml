		<title>19THE COUNTRYSIDE.</title>
		<content> I like living in the country, it is   
 very peaceful and there are lots of   
 trees and fields. The tractors are    
 noisy but otherwise it is very quiet. 
 Most of the time I like to ride my    
 bicycle because there is lots of room 
 and very few cars. Lots of my friends 
 go cycling too and there are some very
 nice cycle rides around Rotherwick.   
 I live in a bungalow in Rotherwick in 
 a quiet lane of the main street. The  
 main street is the only road through  
 the village and it is a very quiet on 
 except at the start and end of school.
 There are some streams near the       
 village and you can often see         
 moorhens, swans, ducks and sometimes  
 water rats.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
