		<content> Westbury-on-Severn Village is situated
 on the A48 road some ten miles west of
 Gloucester and boasts one shop, one   
 pub, the church and the parish hall.  
 The parish of Westbury is one of the  
 largest in England - by area, that is,
 not population.  It is bordered on one
 side by the River Severn and to the   
 south west is the Royal Forest of     
 Dean.  The other main areas of        
 population are the village of Flaxley 
 and Popes Hill.  The parish is served 
 by various 'vans' - baker, butcher,   
 greengrocer, fishmonger.  There is    
 also a School bus service, travelling 
 library and a mobile Health Service   
 Chiropodist.                          
 There is no industry in the area which
 is mainly farm land, dairy and sheep  
 farming being predominant.
