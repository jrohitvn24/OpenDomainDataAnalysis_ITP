		<content>     {Shalford School}was originally   
 allocated a block for the Domesday    
 Project which included{Panfield,}which
 is part of our catchment area but the 
{School}and{Shalford Village}were not  
 included so when we heard that the    
{W.I.}were interested but had no       
 computer access we asked them to join 
 us and help to cover two blocks.      
      This proved very successful. It  
 solved a number of problems in that we
 could then transport children in small
 groups as the ladies mostly had cars  
 and we could provide sufficient       
 numbers of adults to accompany groups.
      The ladies were very interested  
 in the visits which gave opportunities
 to find out so much about our local   
 area and to see what the children were
 doing. The children benefitted from   
 meeting and talking to the ladies and 
 to people we met on our many visits.  </content>
