St. Paul's Church of England Church in 
Croxton is served by the same vicar as 
the parishes of Broughton and Adbaston.
Services are alternated between Croxton
Church and Broughton Church.  There is 
a burial ground attached to the church 
which is still used and which is well  
tended. The church itself is well      
looked after and the grounds are       
neatly kept.                           
There is a small Methodist Chapel in   
Windmill Lane, Croxton.  Regular       
services are held there, together with 
a Sunday School for the children.      
Weddings, Christenings and Burials     
take place at both the Church and the  
Chapel.
