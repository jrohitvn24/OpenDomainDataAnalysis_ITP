		<content>  {Fairford}is a small town with many  
 traditional Cotswold stone buildings. 
 The oldest building is the imposing   
 wool church of St.Mary's built in the 
 late l5th century and renowned for its
 medieval stained glass.  Fairford     
 functions as a service centre for the 
 surrounding villages and has a good   
 range of retail outlets for the       
 everyday shopper.  Antique shops and a
 number of hotels and restaurants are a
 response to a steady stream of        
 visitors.  Fairford has a bank, a     
 solicitor, a doctors' surgery, a      
 dentist, a building society office, as
 well as two garages.  Three schools - 
 one private - provide education for   
 local children.  Public services      
 include a cottage hospital, a police  
 station, a fire station and a library 
 (on three days a week).
