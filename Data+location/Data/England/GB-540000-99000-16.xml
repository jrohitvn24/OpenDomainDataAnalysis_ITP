		<content> My hobby is playing the flute and     
 piano.I have one lesson a week on each
 instrument.I play in a flute quartet  
 which is held at the Brighton Music   
 Centre.I am also a member of the      
 Brighton Junior Orchestra which is    
 held at the Brighton Polytecnic.I     
 often get together with my friend who 
 also plays the flute and we play      
 duets.Sometimes I play the piano and  
 she plays her flute.                  
  Gymnastics is a very good thing      
 because it exercises all our          
 body.Where I go to gymnastics first of
 all we do some exercises then we get  
 on with practising for our British    
 Amateur Gymnastic Association badges.
