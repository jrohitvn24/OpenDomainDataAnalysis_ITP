few facilities.The recreation centre is
also situated in the High Street.      
   The centre has a range of facilities
including swimming baths,squash courts 
sports hall and a floodlit astroturf   
pitch.About 100,000 people a year use  
the centre coming mainly from local    
areas.                                 
   The other major sports facility is  
Chasewater Leisure Park.This is a major
watersports centre.The main activities 
here are sailing,windsurfing,power boat
racing and waterskiing.Major national  
and international power boat races have
been staged there.

and working mens clubs and facilities  
for younger and much older people.     </content>
