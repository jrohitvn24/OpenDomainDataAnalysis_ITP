		<title>06WORK AND LEISURE IN HESSLE</title>
		<content> A questionnaire to parents revealed   
 that a number of fathers work outside 
 Hull because of a lack of jobs in the 
 area. Many mothers work part-time,    
 either during the day or in the       
 evenings. A few mothers work          
 full-time. There are also a growing   
 number of one-parent families. All    
 these factors mean that leisure time  
 is limited. Keep fit, jogging,        
 walking, weight lifting and swimming  
 at the local Sports Centre are popular
 pastimes. Some mothers go to keep-fit 
 and aerobic classes.Squash and        
 badminton are played by many at the   
 Sports Centre.Few parents have unusual
 hobbies - the most common leisure     
 activities include playing darts, pool
 or snooker;gardening;home and car     
 maintenance. Several parents make     
 their own wine, others breed birds or 
 tropical fish; others race pigeons.   </content>
