		<content>      In Marden, quite near the school 
 is a small but specialist factory. The
 owner and his employees make cricket  
 stumps! The raw material is ash planks
 which are then sawn into sizes        
 compatible with the requirements of   
 the finished product. These are then  
 presented to preset lathes which      
 turn the basic shape. More machinery  
 grinds, buffs and polishes and the    
 hand-finishing processes are applied. 
                                       
      The works produces complimentary 
 equipment such as "slip fielding"     
 cradles and indoor cricket and cricket
 practice stumps. These latter have    
 heavy bases and a spring and swivel   
 action.                               
                                       
      The products are distributed all 
 over the country and are in demand    
 from sports firms and County teams.   </content>
