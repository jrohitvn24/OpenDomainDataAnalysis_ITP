		<title>13Farming - Spring to Winter</title>
		<content>   My father who lives nearby arrives  
 about  7a.m.  to   help  finish  the  
 milking,  wash out the pipelines and  
 equipment and water hose the floors to
 clean them of slurry. This frees me to
 go and feed the calves which have been
 weaned from their mothers milk at     
 about six weeks old when they can be  
 fed hay and cake. Mary is busy feeding
 the hens and gathering eggs before    
 preparing breakfast for us all to sit 
 down to at 8a.m. The children are     
 ready to set off for school by 8.30   
 and after another 15 minutes rest we  
 are ready to start the next jobs which
 are largely dependent on the season.  
 The milking routine is the same from  
 Spring to Autumn and only differs in  
 Winter in so far as the cows and beef 
 stock are kept in a covered yard area 
 and not on the open pasture. A second 
 milking is done daily at 4.30p.m.     </content>
