		<title>13Southampton Water.</title>
		<content>    This area was a part of the tidal  
 inland waterway known as Southampton  
 Water.There was no land.Ships sail    
 this water to and from the port of    
 Southampton. They are both cargo and  
 passenger ships.A small ferry also    
 crosses from Southampton Town Quay to 
 Hythe on the western banks of         
 Southampton Water and  there is a     
 regular{ferry and hydrofoil}service to
 Isle of Wight.                        
    Very few large ships now use the   
 shipway with the exception of         
{container ships}using the huge        
 container port up river,special{car   
{transporter ships}from Japan and one  
 or two{passenger liners               
 (Q.E.2,Canberra etc.)                 
    What there are more and more of    
 though is dingies,yachts,sailboards   
 in fact all sorts of{leisure craft.
