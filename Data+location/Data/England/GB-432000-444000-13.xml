		<content> HAREWOOD CASTLE                       
 THE CASTLE IS IN A DANGEROUS          
 CONDITION,AND CANNOT BE VISITED.A GOOD
 VIEW OF THE REMAINS OF THE BATTLEMENTS
 CAN BE SEEN FROM THE A61.MUCH OF ITS  
 EARLY HISTORY IS NOT KNOWN ALTHOUGH IT
 IS THOUGHT THAT THE BUILDING WAS      
 COMMENCED DURING THE REIGN OF KING    
 STEPHEN AND WAS IMPROVED ABOUT 1150   
 DURING THE REIGN OF EDWARD 1 BY       
 WILLIAM DE CURCI.IT WAS BUILT IN THE  
 FORM OF A RIGHT-ANGLED PARALLELOGRAM- 
 ITS SIDES IN THE DIRECTION OF THE     
 CARDINAL POINTS OF THE COMPASS.THE TWO
 SEPARATE TOWERS ON THE SE AND NE WERE 
 OVER 100' HIGH AND COMMANDED A MOST   
 EXTENSIVE VIEW OF THE WHOLE           
 COUNTRYSIDE.THE OTHER TWO TOWERS WERE 
 SMALLER.ONE TOWER WAS BLOWN DOWN IN   
 THE GALES OF FEBRUARY 1962.
