		<title>17Tourism around Langho</title>
		<content>    Tourism is in its infancy here but 
is being encouraged by an association  
of local guest house owners .          
    Langho is really on the very edge  
of the tourist area , situated as it is
on the borders of industry and the     
scenic Ribble Valley . People stay at  
local hotels and guest house           
resteraunts . From this area it is easy
to reach resorts such as Blackpool and 
Fleetwood on the Fylde Coast .         
Alternatively one can travel north     
into the " Trough of Bowland " and     
" Pendle Witch " country . Nearby      
historic Clitheroe and Whalley Abbey   
are of great historical interest to    
visitors though walking in the         
beautiful local countryside is the main
attraction .
