		<title>20Smarden West - Looking Back</title>
		<content> Smarden has changed a lot since I was 
 a boy 50 years ago. In those days we  
 were a self-sufficient community,     
 having our own dairy, bakery, 3       
 grocers, 3 butchers, 2 cobblers, 2    
 blacksmiths, a garage, an ironmonger &amp;
 many other tradesmen, a fire station, 
 doctor and policeman. Now we have only
 1 grocer, 1 butcher, the post office  
 and a garage. Several buses a day ran 
 into Ashford; when most families could
 only afford bikes going to Ashford on 
 the bus or being taken in by a farmer 
 going to market was a real treat.     
 Buses ran late at night to bring home 
 cinema-goers, now those without cars  
 are handicapped. Most families had    
 lived here for generations, now there 
 are many strange faces. It is sad not 
 to know people as we used to when     
 everyone was proud to be a Smardonian 
 born and bred.                        </content>
