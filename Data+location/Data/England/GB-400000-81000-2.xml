		<content> Studland has two general stores and a 
 post office which require few workers.
 Hotel car-parks, kiosks and the{      
{National Trust}shop provide a few more
 jobs.The Beach Warden is responsible  
 for safety of tourists packing the    
 beaches.Local{Guest Houses}are busy   
 during the 'season',a source of more  
 part-time jobs.Milk and dairy products
 are delivered by Mr.R.Vine, a farmer. 
    The bulk of the working population 
 works in the shops,offices,factories  
 and warehouses in the conurbation of {
{Poole}and{Bournemouth}across Poole    
 Harbour.Many people prefer to use the 
 chain ferry which links the Isle of   
 Purbeck with Sandbanks to the North,a 
 way of shortening the daily journey by
 26 miles.
