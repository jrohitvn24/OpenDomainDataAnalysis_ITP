		<title>15DISAPPEARING FOOTPATHS</title>
		<content> East Sussex Highways Authority have   
 ultimate responsibility for clearing  
 footpaths and marking them where they 
 meet up with highways, but resources  
 are limited. There is an appreciable  
 network of footpaths around Fletching 
 and some 20 years ago a group was     
 formed (mainly Womens Institute) to   
 walk, clear and mark them, with arrows
 along their route.                    
 Work gradually lapsed and this year   
 Fletching Parish Council called       
 together interested parties to form a 
 permanent footpath group. The W.I.    
 again showed most interest. Their     
 first task will be to establish       
 ownership of boundaries and from this 
 deduce who is responsible for stiles. 
 They will resume light clearing and   
 marking and may possibly approach     
 local landowners about closing or     
 ploughing up paths.   {D Skan}        </content>
