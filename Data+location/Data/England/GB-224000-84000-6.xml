		<title>06FARMING IN EGLOSKERRY (1)</title>
		<content> As we live in a very rural area we    
 tried to visit all the farms in the   
 twelve kilometre squares and collect  
 information from the farmers. In all  
 we visited seventeen farms. Most of   
 the farmers bought and sold animals at
 Launceston market. Other markets that 
 were used by some of the farmers were 
 Hallworthy, Holsworthy and Week St.   
 Mary. Only one farmer sold his animals
 directly to a slaughter house and not 
 through the market system.            
       The biggest farm is called the  
 Tregeare Estate and has 624 acres.The 
 smallest farm is Tresanber with 5     
 acres. The average farm size is 171   
 acres. The total acreage of all the   
 farms we visited amounted to 2941     
 acres.
