		<title>08The Wellington Monument</title>
		<content>   Anyone passing by  Wellington cannot
 but fail to notice the Monument       
 standing high on the Blackdown Hills. 
 This obelisk is a very popular        
 attraction for both visitors and in   
 habitants alike.                      
   The Monument was built in 1817 to   
 comemerate the military achievments of
 the Duke of Wellington who defeated   
 Napoleon at the battle of Waterloo.   
 The Duke of Wellington was granted the
 Lordship of the Manor of Wellington   
 Borough in about 1813.Why he chose to 
 use the title Wellington is not       
 understood.                           
    The Monument as we know it now was 
 mainly built in 1860.It rises to a    
 hieght of 175ft.and can be climbed by 
 an internal staircase of 235 steps to 
 a viewing chamber.The National Trust  
 are now the custodians.
