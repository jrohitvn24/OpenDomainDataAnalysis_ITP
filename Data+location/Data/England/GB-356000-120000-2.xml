		<title>02MARSTON MAGNA CHURCH.</title>
		<content>  St. Mary the Virgin Church in Marston
 Magna can be divided into two parts.  
 Evidently the east end is the oldest  
 because of the herringbone pattern of 
 bricks, a feature of saxon building.  
 An expert has partially revealed a    
 wall painting of Thomas a'Becket who  
 was an Archbishop of Canterbury being 
 beheaded by four knights said to have 
 come from Somerset.                   
 A fine Norman font with scallop shaped
 moulding has the original stem,base   
 and lead lining.                      
 Modern features include a weather vane
 erected in 1977 to commemorate the    
 Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth 11. 
 The ladies of the village embroidered 
 the kneelers and there are two special
 ones made when the heir to the throne 
 Prince Charles married Princess Diana.
 This church has been a centre of      
 religion for many generations.        </content>
