		<content>   "I got up and read to my younger    
 brother. Iwent downstairs and fed the 
 cats. I fed the lambs with 500g of    
 feed, made sure the hurdles were shut 
 and washed my hands. Then Louise,     
 Daddy and Guy came down to make the   
 breakfast porridge, ( crushed oats    
 boiled in milk with sugar to sweeten).
 Then we went with Mummy in the car, to
 pick up a friend. We had an ice-lolly 
 each. When we got home we played in   
 the paddling pool.                    
   My friend came to play, and we had a
 campfire lunch of sausages and baked  
 beans. I helped Daddy mend a wheel_   
 barrow, and he mended my cycle wheel. 
   We spent 4 hours watching to see if 
 our cat had kittens and then we had   
 tea, poached eggs on toast, then we   
 went to bed." Family- Father is an
