		<content>    The area was originally served by  
 three schools but the Thorney Hill    
 school was closed and the buildings   
 became a private dwelling. The two    
 remaining schools are Bransgore County
 Primary School and Sopley County      
 Primary School.{Bransgore School}was  
 first opened in 1895 as a 'national'  
 school accomodating 174 pupils. The   
 school now serves a growing community 
 and accommodates more than 300        
 children between the ages of five and 
 eleven.                               
   {Sopley School}is not in the village
 of Sopley but is situated at South    
 Ripley. It was built to replace the   
 very small schools of both villages of
 Ripley and Sopley. The school is well 
 supported by the local community and  
 teaches over sixty children of Primary
 age.
