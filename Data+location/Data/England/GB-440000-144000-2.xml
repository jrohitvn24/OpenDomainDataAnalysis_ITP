		<title>02The River Test Lparish</title>
		<content> The Test is a{spring-fed chalk stream,
 the water rising from the chalk at a  
 constant temperature.The water is     
 comparatively shallow and its volume  
 rarely changes.A feature is the       
 division of the main river into large 
 streams.The clear,warm water          
 encourages water plants to grow and   
 this together with the gravel bed     
 provide an ideal habitat for {Brown   
{Trout}-a native of chalk              
 streams.Watercress growing is a small 
 industry in Lparish. {Water-meadows}  
 were once a feature of the Test       
 Valley,but most of these have been    
 drained.A meadow at 04300144 is       
 classed as a S.S.S.I.We went          
 pond-dipping in a stream of the Test  
 at the end of June.We found           
 leeches,minnows,caddis fly larva,     
 water snails,sticklebacks and         
 bullheads.                            </content>
