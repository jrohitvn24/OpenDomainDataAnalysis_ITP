		<content> Housing in{Eastern Green}grew fast in 
 the1950/s &amp; 60/s Houses are brick     
 built, the majority are semi-detached,
 few terraced, detached,bungalows &amp; 4  
 storey flats. 99% -owner occupied;    
 with a  few council houses near Jnr.  
 school. Original owners were often    
 people who were earning good wages in 
 the motor-manufacturing trades &amp;      
 moving from council houses.           
   In 1985 houses are being built for  
 sale at{Millisons Wood,}B'ham Rd,the  
 site of the former Triumph Motor-Cycle
 factory. We talked to 5 people at     
 Millisons Wood.They had lived there   
 from 3 wks to 5 mths,liking it because
 it is near the country &amp; is quiet.They
 use the local shops occasionally and  
 Cannon Park, Coventry for super-      
 markets, no one used the bus service  
 when shopping.A bus service from B'ham
 to Coventry goes along the B'ham Rd   </content>
