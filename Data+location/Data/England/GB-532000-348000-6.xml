		<content> The Rules of Tiggy-chain.             
 Tiggy chain is chasing game. First of 
 all you need about 10 people to play. 
 The rules are that you are not        
 allowed out of the playground. One    
 person has to be on. Someone is after 
 you and if they catch you then you    
 start making a human chain. They have 
 to hold hands and run after someone   
 else. You have to keep doing it until 
 there is only one person left. Then he
 is on.                                
{The Rules of Tiggy-off-Ground.        
{One person is it. You give them 10    
{seconds to start hiding. Then "it"    
{chases after them. Your den is off    
{ground. If you get tigged, you're it. 
{If they are off ground you can't tig  
{them. You can't go running into school
{and you can't be clogs. Clogs means   
{you can't be tigged until you are     
{ready. If you need the loo, use clogs.</content>
