KIT-KAN  A children's playground game. 
This game is played by any number more 
than three. First of all one person    
shouts"Last one to the lamp-post is it 
for Kit-Kan". Everyone runs to the     
lamp- post and the last one there is   
it."It" shuts his eyes and counts to   
100 whilst everybody else hides.When   
"it" opens his eyes everybody tries to 
get back to  base without being seen   
or touched. If the "it" sees  them     
they both run for the base. If the     
"it" reaches the base  first he        
says"Kit-Kan I see(name)" and he       
states where.If the other person gets  
to the base before "it" they say       
"Kit-Kan(own mame) in". The first      
person to fail to get home to base     
will be the next "it".
