		<content>  Craven Arms is a small market town   
 in South Shropshire.The town occupies 
 a fairly level site at about 450 ft.  
 with the River Onny flowing from N.to 
 S.along the eastern side of the town, 
 separating it from the small village  
 of Halford on its east bank.Halford is
 the older settlement and Craven Arms  
 has grown up around the road junction 
 where the N. to S. A49(T) is crossed  
 by the E. to W. B4368.These roads and 
 the A.489 follow natural routeways    
 from their meeting point at Craven    
 Arms.The railway line runs parallel to
 the A49 and has contributed to the    
 growth and development of the town.The
 area has a strong agricultural        
 influence and Craven Arms is an       
 important centre to the local farming 
 community.The town has a small, newly 
 developed industrial estate.
