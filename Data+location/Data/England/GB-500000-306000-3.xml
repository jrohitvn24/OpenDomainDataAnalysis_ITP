 public transport and 6% by cycls.     
 The purchase most frequently made at  
 the market is fresh produce, the main 
 reasons for this being low prices and 
 freshness, 76% of those interviewed   
 rated Stamford Market excellent of    
 good, 14% average and 10% poor.

 cheaper parking facilities, a twice   
 weekly market, and one original       
 request was for busking.
