		<content> THERE WAS ALMOST{100%}AGREEMENT THAT  
 THE{MOST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT}NOTED
 IN THE IMMEDIATE PAST IS THE NUMBER OF
 NEW HOUSES THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT IN THE
 AREA.IN{DOWNGATE}THERE NOW HAS TO BE  
 VERY{STRICT CONTROL OVER NEW HOUSING. 
{THE DEVELOPMENT AT KYL COBER PARC}IN  
 STOKE CLIMSLAND, A MIXTURE OF PRIVATE 
 AND COUNCIL HOUSING ON LAND SOLD TO   
 NORTH CORNWALL DISTRICT COUNCIL BY THE
 THE DUCHY OF{CORNWALL,}WITH PROPOSALS 
 FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF LIGHT INDUSTRIAL
 UNITS, MAY WELL BE THE{BEGINNING OF A 
{GREATER EXPANSION OF HOUSING}IN THE   
 SURVEY AREA. GREAT CONCERN WAS VOICE  
 BY A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THE  
 INFLUX OF NON CORNISH PEOPLE HAD SO   
 INFLATED HOUSING PRICES THAT YOUNG    
 LOCAL PEOPLE WERE HAVING TO MOVE TO   
 NEARBY TOWNS TO SET UP HOMES. IT WAS  
 FELT THAT THE 'CORNISHNESS' OF THE    
 AREA WAS DIMINISHING ALL TOO RAPIDLY. </content>
