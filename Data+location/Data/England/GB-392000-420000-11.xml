		<content>    When the team was first formed     
 between 1870-1880 the team was called 
 White Slack and played friendly       
 matches. Later in 1892 the Central    
 Lancashire League was formed, Walsden 
 being a founder member.               
    Originally the pavilion was by the 
 Rochdale Rd. side, next to the river  
 Calder. Then, in about 1912, an old   
 church was purchased in Oldham and    
 transported to Walsden by horse and   
 cart. This was then formed into a new 
 pavilion on Scott St. The bar and     
 changing room extension was added in  
 1962.                                 
    Walsden played in the league for 64
 years before winning their first      
 title. In 1964, when the professional 
 was Everton Weekes, Walsden won the   
 Wood Cup, the leagues knock-out       
 competition. Since then they have won 
 it in 1962 and 1975. (CONTINUED)      </content>
