		<content> First we went to a farm and the       
 farmer took us round.He took us to a  
 field that had barley in it. It grows 
 about three to our feet high and he   
 feeds it to cattle and they also use  
 it to make beer. This is winter       
 barley. Then we went back to a tick   
 bean field, he feeds this to the      
 pigeons. There were six acres and     
 they                                  
 get Â£180 per tonne. Then we went into 
 a tritikale field, you feed animals on
 this and you can make bread with      
 this.                                 
 Then we went into another field with  
 winter oats which they harvest in     
 October.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
