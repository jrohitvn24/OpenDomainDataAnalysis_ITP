		<content>   Almost our entire year to years work
 is centred on our dairy herd. Owing to
 recently introduced milk quotas       
 imposed by the E.E.C., we have had to 
 cut our herd from 55 to 47 milking    
 cows. Whereas before we only raised   
 heiffer calves as  replacement stock, 
 we now rear some bull calves for the  
 beef market to make up the loss of    
 income from milk.     My day begins at
 4.45a.m. and starts with a cup of tea 
 whilst I listen to the news headlines 
 on the radio. My first task is to     
 gather the cows from pasture and fetch
 them to the parlour helped by my dogs 
 Roy, a 9 year old and Lassie who is   
 just a pup. I also check the young    
 stock in the top fields at this time  
 to make sure they are alright. By     
 6a.m. the cows are positioned in their
 stalls ready to begin milking.
