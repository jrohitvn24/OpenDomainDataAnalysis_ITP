		<content> Since the Middle Ages Coventry has    
 been a manufacturing city. First      
 woollen cloth then ribbons and        
 watches then James Starley's bicycles,
 this led to the start of the motor    
 industry.The Museum of British Road   
 Transport shows the part Coventry     
 played in the history of road         
 transport in Britain. It has over 13O 
 cars and commercial vehicles, 2OO     
 cycles, 7O motorcycles,a considerable 
 range of related artefacts, literature
 and photographs in its collection.The 
 collection was described by the New   
 York Times as "The finest technical   
 collection in Western Europe".The     
 displays are arranged in chronological
 order so that a visitor is carried    
 through the whole story of British    
 transport.
