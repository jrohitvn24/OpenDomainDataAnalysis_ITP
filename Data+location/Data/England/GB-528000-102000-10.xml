		<title>10THE WEST PIER.</title>
		<content> The West Pier wasdesigned by Eusebius 
 Birch and was opened on the 6th       
 October 1866.It was a bare structure  
 lacking any buildings other than      
 kiosks, and a pavilion which was added
 in 1893 for theatre and dance.        
  The West Pier had a long history but 
 in 1969 an application was made to the
 Department of the Environment         
 suggesting the demolition of the      
 unsafe structure.The prospect of      
 losing one of Brighton's most famous  
 landmarks caused enormous public      
 outcry, despite the cost of replacing 
 the seaward end of the pier being over
 Â£650,000.Brighton Council were only   
 able to offer Â£300,000.Following this 
 the pier went on sale to the public   
 for the princely sum of Â£1 in l978    
 with the proviso of carrying out the  
 escalating Â£2 million worth of work.  
 As yet there are no purchasers!       </content>
