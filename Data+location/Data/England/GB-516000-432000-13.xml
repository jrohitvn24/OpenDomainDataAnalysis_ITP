		<title>13 FIELD HOUSE FARM, THIRTLEBY</title>
		<content> Field House Farm in Thirtleby is      
 owned by Mr. Richardson. It is a      
 very big farm, about the biggest in   
 Thirtleby with buildings on both      
 sides of the road.                    
 The farm has geese, pigs, horses and  
 bullocks. One tractor would cost      
 Â£12,000. A combine harvester would    
 cost about Â£35,000.                   
 Mr.Richardson, the farmer, gets up at 
 6.00a.m. He goes to let his bullocks  
 and his horses out of the barn were   
 they have spent the night. He feeds   
 them and then he goes to check the    
 pigs and feeds them. Before his stock 
 of pigs went down he used to use 1ton 
 of pigfood.                           
 He has about 15 geese on the farm and 
 at Christmas the Richardson family eat
 one of them for dinner.
