 OLDER PERSON                          
     " I think Ormskirk is a pleasant  
 town. It has excellent outdoor and    
 indoor markets and the library is good
 and useful. Ormskirk is a very clean  
 place "                               
                                       
 YOUNGER PERSON                        
     " The clock tower is a great thing
 to have. It is a kind of symbol for   
 Ormskirk. There should be more parking
 spaces. The other thing we need is a  
 large department store. I like        
 Ormskirk very much "                  
                                       
 VISITOR.                              
    " I come from Sydney, Australia.   
 Ormskirk is very quaint. I            
 particularly like the pubs. Altogether
 it is a very good town. "
