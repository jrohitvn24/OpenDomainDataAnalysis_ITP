   In our area there are two types of  
public transport,the bus and the       
taxi.The  bus is used most widely.We   
did a survey in  our class  and found  
that the car was the most widely used  
vehicle.On coming to school 55% came   
by car,30% by bike and 15% walked.70%  
of our fathers' went to work by car and
10% went by train.We found that the    
families of the people in our class    
altogether had 73 cars and 157         
bicycles.Some used motorbikes or       
mopeds to get around and some walked   
if it was not too far away.Some        
people's fathers get to work by coach  
which stops in the town centre.In our  
area there are three petrol stations   
conveniently situated.Some people's    
dads travel to work by 'plane even     
though there is not an airport in our  
area.                                  </content>
