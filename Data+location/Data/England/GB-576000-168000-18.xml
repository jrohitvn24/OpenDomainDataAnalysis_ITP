		<title>18The Naval Memorial</title>
		<content> Next to our school is a Naval Memorial
 to all the sailors, registered at     
 Chatham who died during the two world 
 wars and do not have a marked grave   
 elsewhere.  There are two other almost
 identical memorials, one at Plymouth  
 and the other at Portsmouth.          
                                       
 The memorial consists of a one hundred
 foot high obelisk of portland stone   
 with four carved lions at the base    
 and, at the top, four large figures   
 representing the four winds. Around   
 the foot of the obelisk are thirty-two
 panels of sailors' names who died in  
 the First World War. Surrounding the  
 obelisk on three sides is a wall which
 carries the names of Second World War 
 victims. The memorial overlooks       
 Chatham and like the other two was    
 sited so that it could be used as a   
 landmark by shipping.                 </content>
