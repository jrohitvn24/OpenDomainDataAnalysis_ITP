		<content>    One of the major influences on the 
 south-eastern corner of the block was 
 the contribution of the soap magnate  
 W.H.Lever. Having made his fortune at 
 Port Sunlight, this Boltonian returned
 to the scene of his courtship at      
 Rivington, selecting a site above     
 Horwich as the ideal retreat where he 
 built a bungalow with extensive       
 gardens from 1900.                    
    The house itself is properly the   
 subject of another block, but a large 
 area of the gardens centred around a  
 Japanese lagoon and terrace are within
 our scope. Even more significantly,   
 Lever donated a large area of his     
 estate as a park for the people of    
 Bolton.                               
    Like many Victorians he was a stern
 believer in self-help and profit but  
 was also a remarkable philanthropist.
