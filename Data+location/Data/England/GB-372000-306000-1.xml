		<content>   Shifnal,with its population of 6,272
 (1981),is in the east of Shropshire   
 close to the Staffordshire border.The 
 tributary of the River Severn,the     
 Worfe ,flows through Shifnal and the  
 surrounding agricultural plain.       
   Shifnal was given to Roger de       
 Montgomery by William the Conqueror.  
 The village became a busy little town 
 in coaching days with timber framed   
 buildings.This part of Shropshire     
 became industrialised with the nearby 
 revolution in the iron industry ,and  
 Shifnal was a chain manufacturing     
 centre .                              
     Extending from the western        
 boundary of Shifnal is the growing    
 town of Telford with an ultimate      
 population of 220,000.The M54 now     
 links the new town with the M6.Shifnal
 has a main line station,and is not    
 far from the city of Birmingham.      </content>
