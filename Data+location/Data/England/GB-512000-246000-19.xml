		<content> Although the Women's Institute faded  
 out 8 or 9 years ago, many other local
 clubs &amp; societies flourish &amp; good use 
 is made of the excellent facilities in
 the Village Hall.  Most groups draw   
 members from the adjacent village of  
 Ickwell &amp; organisations such as{Play- 
{group, Mothers and Toddlers}and the   
{Recorder Society}are based there.     
 The{Mothers' Union, Bellringers}and   
{Nomads}(youth club) are closely linked
 with the Church, whilst{Thursday Club 
 and{Social Circle}meet monthly in     
 members' homes for entertainment and  
 discussion, and to raise money for    
 local causes.  There is a thriving    
{Drama Group,}and the{British Legion,  
{Brownies, Parent-Teacher Association, 
 and{Conservative Association}are all  
 well supported.  The{Badminton Club}  
 plays twice weekly, and the{N'Amblers 
 follow the local footpaths each month.</content>
