		<content>    My digital watch woke me at 7.0    
 a.m. I washed, prayed, ate my         
 breakfast of Cornflakes and orange,   
 dressed in my uniform and walked to   
 school. From 9.0 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. I  
 worked in school, with one hour's     
 break for lunch.                      
    Our morning work was mathematics,  
 followed by English language and then 
 Religious Education. In the afternoon 
 we had a craft lesson. I am making a  
 wool cushion on a circular weaving    
 loom.                                 
    After school I rode my Commando    
 bike, watched a television programme, 
 and read some of my book. We had a    
 family meal and I went to bed at 7.30 
 p.m.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
