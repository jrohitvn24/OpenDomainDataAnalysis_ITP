		<content>  {Bikes}are the most popular outdoor  
 activity.This is due to the fact that 
{stunt bikes}have become very popular. 
 This cheap form of transport allows   
 children to visit friends and local   
 facilities.In this way children are   
 independent of their parents.However  
 many children are restricted to a     
 limited area.                         
  {Marbles}is the most popular game to 
 play inside at home.They are round    
 glass objects.Two people play,one     
 person throws his marble and the other
 person tries to hit it.If he or she   
 hits it they keep the other persons   
 marble and their own,but if they miss 
 the other person has a go.It keeps on 
 going on like this until someone wins.
