		<title>14The Old Dairy</title>
		<content>    The{Old Dairy}is located opposite  
 the poplar trees to the north of      
 Kinoulton.It was built in{1925}by the 
 Corporation of Kinoulton farmers.They 
 built it to make{Stilton Cheese}and   
 the milk which was delivered by lorry 
 was also supplied by the farmers.It   
 was powered by electricity and some of
 the water for washing was,pumped under
 ground by pipes,from the stream       
 running behind the dairy.In the{Second
{World War}the dairy was transformed   
 in to a bungalow so some  officers    
 from R.A.F.Newton could live          
 there.They named it{Bridge Bungalow   
 because of the bridge over the        
 stream.After the war the officers left
 and Bridge Bungalow was put up for    
 sale.A few years later the Parsons    
 bought it and renamed{it'The Old      
{Dairy'}because they wanted to call it 
 by its real name.                     </content>
