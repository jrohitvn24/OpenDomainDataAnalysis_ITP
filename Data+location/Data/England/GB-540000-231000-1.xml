		<title>01The Area Around Anstey.</title>
		<content> Anstey,Meesden and Brent Pelham are   
 small villages in the Hertfordshire   
 countryside.There are only a few      
 hundred people in each.The land around
 is almost entirely farmland,with small
 copses and woods.There is one large   
 stretch of woodland called Scales     
 Park.The farmland is mainly arable    
 with some dairy,pig and chicken       
 farming.                              
 Most of the people work outside the   
 villages,travelling to nearby towns or
 into London and all but a few children
 are bussed to nearby town schools.    
 It is a quiet area with few           
 recreational facilities although many 
 fund raising functions are held       
 throughout the year.Many of the people
 have chosen to live in the area       
 because of the quiet.There are some   
 historical sites such as the castle   
 mound,the church and many moats.      </content>
