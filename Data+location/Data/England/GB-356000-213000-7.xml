		<title>07A Day in my life 2</title>
		<content> At 12:00 we get lunch ready. we lay   
 the tables and put chairs around      
 them.The dinner is put on our plates  
 and we go away to eat it and when we  
 are finished we clear it up and go    
 outside to play. We come in at 1:00pm 
 and work through to 2:15pm and have   
 quarter of an hour break.After break  
 we work to 3:30 then we go home.      
 When I get home I watch T.V. or play  
 on my computer or bike.At 5:30 I have 
 tea.After tea if its a nice day I go  
 out and play.                         
 I finish playing about 8:00 and then I
 watch T.V.                            
 Then I get ready for bed and say      
 goodnight to mum and dad.             
 I then go upstairs and jump into bed  
 and sometimes I am allowed to read for
 a while.After reading I switch of my  
 light and go to sleep.                
                                       </content>
