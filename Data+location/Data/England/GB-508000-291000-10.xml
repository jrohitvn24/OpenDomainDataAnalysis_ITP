		<content> Traditionlly May Day is celebrated on 
 May 1st but at school we choose any   
 day early in the month.Out comes the  
 wooden Maypole on its stand,and we    
 dance around it to music.Ribbons      
 attached to the pole twirl into       
 patterns as the children dance"Spiders
 Web","Barbers Pole"and Plaiting.On Nov
 5th we have Bonfire Night.There is a  
 huge pile of wood on the field by the 
 mill,with a dummy on top to represent 
 Guy Fawkes who attempted              
 unsuccessfully to blow up Parliament  
 long ago.Bright fireworks fly into the
 sky and there is food and drink for   
 sale.                                 
      A new tradition has started of   
 having a children's party in the      
 Highgate Hall soon after              
 Christmas.There are games and a buffet
 meal and finally a magician.
