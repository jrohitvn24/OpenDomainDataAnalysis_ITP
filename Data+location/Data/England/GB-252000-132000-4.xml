		<content> The sort of{games}we play in the      
 playground in the 1980's are often    
 basically similar.Forty forty is like 
 Hide and Seek.French skipping is like 
 Jinx;Turkey,Mother May I,Grand        
 Mother's Footsteps and My Red Letter  
 are all similar.Off ground Tick,Budge 
 and Sticky Glue are roughly the same. 
 Redrovers, Bulldog, Polo, Steps, Egg- 
 Bacon-Cheese or Flan, and S-T-O-P     
 are alike also.{THE RULES TO PLAY:    
{Budge}is for two players or over. You 
 need 3 items in the playground which  
 can be "safe" areas. There is one     
 person who's "it",she counts to ten   
 while the other players run away. She 
 chases one of the players to a "safe" 
 area in the playground.If the player  
 gets there,the chaser will then chase 
 somebody else.If another player goes  
 to a"safe" area which is not free the 
 person shouts{budge}and has to run on.</content>
