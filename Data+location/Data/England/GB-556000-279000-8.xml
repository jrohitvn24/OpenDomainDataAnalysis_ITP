		<title>08THE ELY-ADELAIDE RAILWAY(i)</title>
		<content>    The railway line runs for 2        
 kilometres across our area from       
 North-West to North-East.There is a   
 very important junction at Adelaide   
 where three lines diverge.One of the  
 lines goes to Peterborough,another    
 goes to Kings-Lynn and the third goes 
 to Norwich.These lines are controlled 
 from Ely North Junction Signal Box.The
 Signal Box was built in 1926 and      
 contains hand operated levers to work 
 the signals on the track.Sixteen      
 trains go to Peterborough each day    
 nine to Kings-Lynn and ten to         
 Norwich.The railway lines cross the   
 Ely-Prickwillow road at three level   
 crossings which have gates operated   
 from the Signal Box.In order from the 
 Ely side they are called the Lynn,    
 Peterborough and Norwich Road         
 Crossings.
