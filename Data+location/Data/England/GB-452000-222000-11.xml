		<title>11 ALL SAINTS CHURCH</title>
		<content>   This fine old church dates from the 
second half of the twelth century      
and stands on the site of the old      
village.It contains many interesting   
features.The oldest parts are the      
chancel and the south doorway.         
   The octagonal font, after many      
mishaps,came into the possession of    
the Jersey family and was given to the 
church in 1860.It is thought to be that
in which Edward the Confessor was      
baptised.                              
   The Jersey chapel was built on the  
north side of the chancel and contains 
the family monuments.The crypt is      
underneath.                            
   On the north wall is a list of the  
Rectors, beginning with Gervasse de    
Paveley in 1217.                       
   The church is open all year round   
for visitors.
