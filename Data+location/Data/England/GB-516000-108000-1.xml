		<title>01The Bramber Gap</title>
		<content> Between Worthing and Brighton, the    
 River Adur, having passed through the 
 gap it has cut across the South Downs,
 reaches the sea at Shoreham. This     
 survey block covers the northern entry
 to the river gap. This very position, 
 where dry east-west Downs route       
 crossed the river route, caused the   
 Normans to build Bramber Castle in the
 1070s. Most of the block is downland  
 or the wide meadows, once marsh, of   
 the river. On the eastern edge of the 
 block a cement works eats into the    
 Downs and along the northern edge of  
 of the block run three nearly         
 interlocking communities: the southern
 half of the town of Steyning, centred 
 in the block to the north; Bramber, a 
 small village ranged along the ancient
 causeway to the bridge, and Upper     
 Beeding, a modern 'suburban' commuter 
 settlement.                           </content>
