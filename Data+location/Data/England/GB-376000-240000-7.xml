		<title>07RELIGION IN LITTLE MALVERN</title>
		<content>{The parish church,}part of the        
 original monastic foundation, has as  
 its incumbent the Rev E. Cox who lives
 just outside the parish in his own    
 house. The parish of 56 is not large  
 enough to warrant a full-time priest  
 so Rev Cox has spent most of his time 
 in school chaplaincy work and in      
 teaching. The congregation on Sunday  
 mornings at the{Eucharist}numbers     
 about 50 and is drawn from a wide     
 geographical area. The{Roman Catholic 
{church}built in 1862 serves a         
 congregation most of whom come from   
 outside Little Malvern. The priests   
 are{Benedictines from Downside Abbey. 
 There is a friendly relationship      
 between Anglicans and Roman Catholics,
 congregations and priests. The        
 Berrington family of{Little Malvern   
{Court,}Catholics since the Reformation
 have recently adopted Anglicanism.    </content>
