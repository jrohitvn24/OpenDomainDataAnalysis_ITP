		<title>10Alison's Friday 1.25_10.00</title>
		<content> The{afternoon}lessons begin with      
 geography and history, where lately we
 have been working on this{Domesday    
 Project. During the project we have   
 visited several farms, villages and   
 interviewed people in the area. The   
 last lesson on a friday is Maths where
 we work from text books, solve        
 problems and do topics.               
    My school day ends at 3.35 when I  
 catch the schoolbus back to Ashcott   
 and I arrive home at 4.00.            
    At 5.00, after having an early tea,
 I go to Pedwell and work  at the      
 Kamine kennels for 3 hours, until     
 8.00. When I get home I watch         
 television and do a bit of{homework   
 until about 10.00 when I go to bed.   
 This shows a little of my{home life   
 and schooling in 1985
