		<content>  {Headstone Lane Station}was opened in
 1913 for the London North Western     
 Railway. Service was provided by      
 British Railways Midland Region in    
 1948 when all the railways were       
 nationalized and now links Euston, in 
 London, to the Midlands and Scotland. 
 The main line is electrified and      
 through trains are powered by overhead
 electric wires. It is mainly used as a
 London commuter service station for   
 local people. There is no car park.   
   Built in 1911,{Hatch End Station}is 
 an attractive red-brick building. When
 the station first opened, only two    
 trains per day stopped: today, 171    
 local passenger, non-stopping         
 passenger and goods trains go through 
 the station between 9.00am and 3.30pm.
 It is mostly used by business men and 
 shoppers going to London and by       
 college students.                     </content>
