		<title>19LOWER DARNFORD FARMHOUSE</title>
		<content> On monday 3rd of June 13 third year   
 children from{Mount Pleasant Junior}  
{school}Shrewsbury set off for Lower   
 Darnford  Farm.We went with Mr        
 Carruthers  our Headmaster, Miss Wall 
 our teacher, and{Mr Taylor}a  lecturer
 from{Chester College.}We surveyed the 
 surrounding hedges.It was interesting 
 to see what was growing in each       
 hedge.On Tuesday morning we worked on 
 a group of trees half a mile          
 downstream from the farm house.They   
 were mostly{beech,sycamore}and        
{scots pine.}We worked in groups making
 a survey of what we saw growing in and
 around each tree ,where the tree was  
 positioned,what the tree looked and   
 felt like, taking measurements and    
 estimating the age.We made sketches   
 and took notes.Afterwards we sat still
 and listened to the sounds we could   
 hear around us.                       </content>
