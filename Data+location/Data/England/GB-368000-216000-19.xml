		<title>19NOTTSWOOD HILL</title>
		<content>{Nottswood Hill}is the hamlet at the   
 extreme eastern end of our area. It   
 consists of only 6 houses and so the  
 population is very small. We decided  
 to include it in the text because the 
 people here still enjoy commoners'    
 rights.This is one of the few areas in
 Gloucestershire which still possesses 
 these rights.{Walnut Tree Cottage}    
 which dates from 1678 is of wattle and
 daub construction. In the past the    
 cottages must have been built by      
 squatters. It is interesting to note  
 that the hamlet was not enclosed in   
 the 18th century, probably because it 
 was mainly used for sheep-farming and 
 not under arable cultivation.
