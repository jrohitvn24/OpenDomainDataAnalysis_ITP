		<content> In our survey we asked ,'Why do you   
 like Tenterden and why did you move   
 here?'                                
 Few moved because they had found work 
 in Tenterden itself but liked it as a 
 'nice place to live'. All those       
 questioned thought it a very friendly 
 place and a caring community. The     
 older people thought there were plenty
 of activities for them.Those involved 
 with church activities were always    
 busy.All thought it a pretty town with
 its tree-lined High Street, blend of  
 old and new shops and the Kentish tile
 -hung houses. Most thought the        
 surroundings rural and were pleased   
 that the developments so far had left 
 the centre unspoilt. Middle-aged and  
 older people thought that the         
 amenities were good but younger people
 and particularly teenagers disagreed.
