		<title>15Two Bridges - Climate</title>
		<content> The average height above sea level is 
 1200 to 1500 feet, which makes the    
 area very exposed to the prevailing   
 South-Westerly winds, which bring in  
 rain laden clouds from across the     
 Pacific Ocean.                        
                                       
 The height and lack of natural        
 obstacles also reduces the air        
 temperature, which, together with the 
 wind chill factor, results in a       
 relatively cool climate even in the   
 height of summer. Sometimes the clouds
 come in very low and a thick mist     
 occurs, visibility often down to a    
 matter of a few yards.                
                                       
 During the summer, when the wind drops
 it can become very hot, with little or
 no shade availabl.e
