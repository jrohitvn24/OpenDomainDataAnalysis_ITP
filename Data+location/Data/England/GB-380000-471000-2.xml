		<content> The church dates from Norman times.   
 The characteristic 'dog-tooth'        
 moulding and zig zag carving can be   
 seen round the arch of the South door 
 and on the font.  The chancel, aisles 
 and tower date from the 14th and 15th 
 centuries.  The tower houses three    
 bells.  The earliest, dated 1614,     
 bears the Latin inscription "I will   
 sing to Thee O God with a pleasant    
 sound".  The registers dating from    
 1556 are lodged with the County       
 Archivist in Northallerton.  The old  
 graveyard contains some interesting   
 table-top gravestones. The slate in   
 several gravestones is crumbling, so  
 this year a survey has been carried   
 out to record the existing stones.    
 Several memorial brasses have been    
 removed from the gravestones and      
 placed inside the church to preserve  
 them from the weather.                </content>
