		<content> Most residents have pleasant gardens, 
 some with swimming-pools. They also   
 have easy access to open countryside. 
 Bookham Common is mainly wooded (oaks 
 provided pannage for swine in 1086).  
 The first fish ponds created by       
 Chertsey Abbey survive, and there are 
 small fishing ponds in Eastwick. The  
 National Trust has used volunteers to 
 clear ponds &amp; scrub on the Common.    
                                       
 Surrey County Council has just        
 produced a plan to increase the use of
{Norbury Park}for casual recreation and
 education. They plan to manage the    
 wood and farmland to re-establish open
 downland &amp; improve public access.     
 Local residents using it to exercise  
 their dogs oppose the plan, fearing an
 influx of people and 'hot dog' vans.  
 Others welcome the idea of a country  
 park.                                 </content>
