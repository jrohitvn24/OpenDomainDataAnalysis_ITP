		<content> Five miles from Langwathby is the M6  
 and the A6.They take us south to the  
 industrial Midlands.The A6 then A74   
 take us to Central Scotland.The main  
 North/South passenger and freight line
 is five miles away at Penrith.Our     
 local line is the scenic Settle to    
 Carlisle line.This 119 year old line  
 is 72 miles long running through the  
 Eden valley.It can only take diesel or
 steam trains.There are four passenger 
 and two frieght trains each day. N0   
 trains stop as the station closed in  
 1970.We are trying to save this lovely
 line as a tourist attraction and a    
 working railway.Most weekends steam   
 trains use the line.The school has    
 hired steam trains twice for trips.We 
 have done a survey in Langwathby to   
 find out the viability of running a   
 shopper and commuter train to Carlisle
 owing to bus cuts.RESULTS-90% For.    </content>
