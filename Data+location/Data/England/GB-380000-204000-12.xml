		<title>12GAMES CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content> Children play many games at home and  
 at school.  At home they play Snooker,
 Pool, Little Soldiers, Star Wars and  
 Action Force.  Pool is a game played  
 on a special table with two players   
 and 16 balls - 7 yellow, 7 red, one   
 black and one white.  Once someone    
 pots a ball he goes for the other 6   
 balls.  Black is the last to be       
 potted.  At school they play          
 rounders, Bull Dogs, Football, Line   
 Tag, Cricket and War.  Cricket is a   
 game with 22 players, 11 on each side.
 One side fields and the other side    
 bats.  Two men bat at a time and score
 runs by hitting a leather ball which  
 is bowled to them.  A man is out after
 being caught, bowled or stumped.  The 
 side with the most runs, wins.
