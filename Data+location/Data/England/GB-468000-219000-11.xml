    At about one o'clock I make my way 
home for my dinner. After dinner I     
sometimes help my mum with washing the 
dishes and then I go out again while my
mum and dad work in the garden or watch
T.V. There isn't all that much to do   
around where I live so I often get     
bored.                                 
    On the Prison Estate I also have a 
lot of friends and so I go up there to 
see them, but they are not always at   
home and so I go fishing at the Church 
Pond. It is quite a good place for     
fishing and the Scouts often go there  
canoeing.                              
    When I go home I listen to the Top 
Forty records on the radio and when    
that has finished I have a bath, then  
have tea with the family and we all    
watch a film on television. At about   
nine o'clock I go to bed.              </content>
