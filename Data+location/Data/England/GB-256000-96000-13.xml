		<title>13FARMING NOW AND THEN</title>
		<content>   Mr. and Mrs. Watts have lived at    
{Knowle Farm}for forty years. They     
 gave us some information about the    
 farm and what life was like forty     
 years ago and{how farming has changed 
 since then.  In{1939}they changed from
 horse and cart to tractors. There were
 no freisian cows then only lots of    
 dairy Shorthorns. They didn't have    
 silage because all the grass was made 
 into hay.                             
   They did milking by hand because    
 they had{no electricity}for milking.  
 The hay was brought in loose and made 
 into haystacks as there were no       
 bailers.                              
   They had a hay knife and when they  
 wanted some hay they cut it out of the
 hay stack which was a horrible job.   
 There were no combine harvesters only 
 binders and they needed three horses  
 to pull them.                         </content>
