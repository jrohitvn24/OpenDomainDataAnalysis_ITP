		<content> East Ravendale Hall has been opened as
 an old peoples' home since February   
 1984. The people who own the hall are 
 called the Mortimers and 4 members of 
 the family live at the hall now. There
 are 13 places for old people but they 
 hope for 17. Â£110 is the fee set by   
 the government. 14 people work at the 
 hall and special diets are provided   
 for the inmates. The hall was         
 previously owned by the Parkinsons and
 before them the seventh Baronet       
 Thorold. The hall was built as a hall 
 in 1720. Before then it was a small   
 farm house. There are a few legends   
 about the hall, the most popular is   
 called the Black Lady. The old woman  
 is said to have set 3 rooms on fire in
 the hall. Members of the Parkinson    
 family have seen this ghost.
