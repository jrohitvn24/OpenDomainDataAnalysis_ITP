		<title>04RECREATION IN LYNSTED</title>
		<content> There are very few facilities for     
 playing sports or following a hobby in
 the Lynsted area. There are no        
 playgrounds, no tennis courts, no     
 parks, no sports areas. I found that  
 the most popular pastime in Lynsted is
 watching T.V. The children I asked    
 watch television for two to five hours
 a day. The popular games are playing  
 rounders &amp; cricket, tennis, running &amp; 
 swimming in summer. In the playground 
 most people like playing "Filmstars" &amp;
 "Squareball". On T.V. the most popular
 programmes are Soap Operas. For music 
 the children like "Wham" &amp; the older  
 people like Rock &amp; Roll or Classical  
 like Bing Crosby. People try to play  
 sports in their garden if it is big   
 enough. Some children play in the     
 fields because there are no proper    
 sports places. You have to invent your
 own games.                            </content>
