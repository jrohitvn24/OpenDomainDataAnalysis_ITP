		<title>11Ducklington Mill/Grain Store</title>
		<content> This large development is built on the
site of one of the old water mills on  
the edge of Ducklington. Originally the
River Windrush powered the mill for the
fulling process for the local woollen  
industry and then was converted to corn
milling. More recently it has produced 
animal feeds. On the same site as the  
mill, huge grain stores have been built
recently. These vast stores hold 38,000
tonnes of surplus grain.               
 There is much annoyance with the local
council for allowing the building of   
such a large industrial site in a      
rural area, on the edge of a village   
where it would be impossible to get    
permission to build a house.           
 There is even more controversy about  
storing so much grain in this country  
whilst millions of people are starving 
because of widespread famine in        
Ethiopia and much of Central Africa    </content>
