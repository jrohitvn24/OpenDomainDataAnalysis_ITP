		<content>    Thousands visit Dartmouth for the  
{Royal Regatta}which has been held     
 every year with few exceptions since  
 1834. It will cost about 7000 pounds  
 this year paid for in the main from   
 the sale of draw tickets, collections 
 and donations.                        
    A great variety of events make up  
 the three day Regatta in addition to  
 the boat and yacht races. These       
 include tennis, darts and bowling     
 tournaments, swimming in the Boat     
 Float and a home made raft race.      
    One of the main attractions is the 
 spectacular air display by the{Red    
{Arrows}which cost 2,500 pounds. The   
 team are said to enjoy doing their    
 display over Dartmouth, particularly  
 as the terrain is so interesting.     
  The{firework}displays on the thursday
 and saturday evenings provide a time  
 of great atmosphere.                  </content>
