		<content> Caldwell is a small hamlet in the     
 heart of the country.It is mainly a   
 farming community,with at least four  
 farm yards opening onto the one main  
 road.Caldwell hall,once the lord of   
 the manor's residence is now a school 
 for maladjusted children.Caldwell also
 has a small light engineering firm    
 called Colbere Engineering,employing  
 local people.There is one puplic house
 the Royal Oak parts of which are      
 thought to be 300 years old.There is a
 small development of new houses,with  
 planning permission for extension of  
 the site. Caldwell has no shops       
 or Post Office,the nearest being at   
 Rostiston.St.Giles church,is an       
 interesting building which is thought 
 to date back to Anglo saxon &amp; Norman  
 times.Some of the old stained glass   
 windows have been removed to protect  
 them from damage caused by subsidence.</content>
