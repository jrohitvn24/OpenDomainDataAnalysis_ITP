		<title>18Spring Farm Vineyard.</title>
		<content> General Information:- apart from the  
{vineyard}Mr Rees has sheep and pigs   
 which he sells for meat and poultry   
 for his own consumption. This has     
 enabled him to experiment with the    
 vineyard and still have a reliable    
 income from{farming.                  
  As yet Mr Rees has no major outlets  
 and sells mainly to restaurants in the
 West Country, and also to{visitors}who
 come to look around the vineyard and  
 have a meal.                          
 The beginning of the growing year is  
 the end of October and as the vines   
 dieback for the winter, they are      
 pruned individually. the last of the  
 9000 vines are finished by April and a
 weedkiller is put down. The vineyard  
 is less busy in May as the vines start
 growing,and they then have to be      
{sprayed}with zinc and sulphur every 10
 days until late October early November</content>
