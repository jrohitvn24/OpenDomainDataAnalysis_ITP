 an appointed Clerk. They normally     
 serve for four years and quarterly    
 meetings are held with other meetings 
 as necessary. A Parish Meeting is held
 prior to a Council Meeting should the 
 business be of a controversial nature.
 In all planning applications the Parks
 Dept,asks the Council for observations
 The Council liaises with all local    
 government depts to ensure the well   
 keeping of the village. The management
 of the moorland and Hutton Common is  
 under the jurisdiction of the Manor of
 Spaunton Court Leet.
