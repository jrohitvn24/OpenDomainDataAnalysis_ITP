&lt;br />&lt;br />Diary entry.  &lt;br />&lt;br />On the 25th June I woke up on a typical Saturday. During that day I played on my Nintendo wii which was invented in 2008. Some stuff we have now they did not have in the 1980s such as I pods, mobile phones and the internet. &lt;br />Later that day I had to go to Sutton for a swimming compaction, my club won. The next day I had to wake up at 6:45am because I had another gala at Beachdale where I won one trophy.&lt;br />Straight after that I went to Trent bridge to watch Notts play cricket, which we won by 53 runs. &lt;br />&lt;br />Technology.&lt;br />In 2011 we have a lot more of technology such as phones, I pads, computers and Nintendo DS. The newest thing is 3d which makes things pop out of the screen like its right in front of you. &lt;br />&lt;br />Schools&lt;br />&lt;br />There are many schools in Bestwood such as Westglade, Southglade, Robin Hood and Arnbook. But the one I go to is Glade hill which has 235 people in it, many schools have more people. &lt;br />  &lt;br />
