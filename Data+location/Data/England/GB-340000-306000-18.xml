		<title>18POLTERGEIST AT LEA CROSS</title>
		<content> Two years ago in Lea Cross there were 
 some strange happenings.  The family  
 living in a house - previously a Post 
 Office - were building an extension.  
 The family cat was in a room with the 
 window closed but the door left open. 
 The family went out and when they     
 returned the cat was found dead on the
 floor and the door was closed and     
 locked, with one window open. That    
 night the family went to bed as usual 
 and heard strange noises.Several items
 were found to be moved in the morning.
 These strange happenings kept going on
 for several weeks and then called the 
 police to see if there was evidence of
 a burglary. There was none. After     
 several incidents of this kind it was 
 decided that there were poltergeists  
 in the house, so the family decided to
 pull down the interior walls, there   
 were no more problems from that day.  </content>
