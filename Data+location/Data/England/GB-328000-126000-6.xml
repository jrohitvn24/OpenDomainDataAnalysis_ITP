		<title>06THE ECOLOGY OF CHARLTON</title>
		<content>  We visited two elderly sisters at    
 their home in Charlton.They love their
 large garden and spend a lot of time  
 working in it,growing flowers and     
 vegetables.They are keen observers of 
 the local natural history.            
  They are saddened by many of the     
 changes they have seen in the last ten
 years.They blamed indescriminate weed 
 spraying for the disappearance of many
 wild flowers,for example,meadowsweet, 
 flag iris,toadflax and cuckoo flowers.
 Ducks,moorhens,coots and swans have   
 also gone.They think this was due to  
 the pollution of the canal from the   
 town and farms.It is now cleaner,but  
 the birds have not returned.          
  The landscape has been changed by the
 results of Dutch Elm disease and the  
 cutting back,or removal of hedges,to  
 make bigger fields.                   
  Many R.A.F.planes fly low overhead.  </content>
