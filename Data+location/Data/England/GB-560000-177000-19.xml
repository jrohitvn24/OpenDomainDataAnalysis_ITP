		<title>19GRAYS, ROAD ACCIDENTS</title>
		<content>  A recent report by road safety       
 experts in Thurrock has pin-pointed a 
 worrying increase in the number of    
 road accidents, and this is alarming  
 the people of Grays. Top of the       
 black-spot list is Orsett Road in     
 Grays, where 31 accidents involving   
 death or injury have happened since   
 1982. The council's engineering       
 services committee has now decided to 
 give priority to the site between the 
 Thameside Theatre and Park View       
 Gardens and attempt to make           
 improvements that will reduce the     
 number of road accidents. It was      
 predicted at the committee meeting    
 that if the problem were to be        
 ignored, it was estimated that 1000   
 accidents would occur over the next 10
 years, involving 1300 casualties.     
                                       
                                       </content>
