		<content>   Our survey was to find out what     
{vegetables}people eat and whether they
 are home-grown.                       
   100% of our survey have a garden.   
 65% have a vegetable patch. The main  
 reasons why the others do not are:    
   1. Their gardens are too small.     
   2. Insufficient interest and time.  
   3. Good vegetables are readily      
 available locally.                    
   Those who do grow their own         
 vegetables do so for the following    
 reasons.                              
   1. They are fresh and taste better. 
   2. They have better food value.     
   3. Gardening is a hobby.            
   4. To save money.                   
   5. They dislike the widespread use  
 of chemicals by commercial growers.   
   6. Surplus produce can be frozen.   
   Vegetables grown include beans,     
 carrots, potatoes, tomatoes and peas. </content>
