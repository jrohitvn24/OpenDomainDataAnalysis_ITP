		<title>13BMX TRACKS IN BIRSTALL</title>
		<content> BMX is a fast growing sport all over  
 the country. This involves racing or  
 performing stunts on a bike that has  
 small wheels and a special frame. For 
 safety you are advised to wear a crash
 helmet, knee and elbow pads, gloves   
 and suitable footwear e.g. trainers.  
    Many children attempt stunts and   
 races in the streets using the kerbs  
 to help with the tricks. A local video
 shop owner took a suggestion from the 
 children to the Parish Council for a  
 safe BMX track to be built. They      
 decided that it could be sited at the 
 Meadow Lane Playing fields.           
    The Birstall Action Team built it  
 using mounds of soil, which were      
 accidentally left on the football     
 pitch, and old tyres from a local     
 garage. It was finished in July, but  
 it is on the other side of the A6 from
 where I live!                         </content>
