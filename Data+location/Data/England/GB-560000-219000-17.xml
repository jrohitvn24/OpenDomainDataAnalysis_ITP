		<title>17United Reform Church, Dunmow</title>
		<content>   At the United Reform Church we found
 that wine represents Jesus' blood and 
 bread represents his body.  People    
 preach from the pulpit.  The choir    
 comes in and one of the elders puts   
 the Bible on the stand and then they  
 sing hymns, say prayers and have a    
 sermon.                               
   There are no statues in the church, 
 and on the air pump of the organ there
 are lots of carvings of names but     
 there are no bells or coloured windows
 like other churches.  There is a      
 balcony with many extra seats but this
 has been blocked off since fewer      
 people attend now and this saves heat 
 in Winter.                            
   The church has many social meetings 
 and runs a Sunday school.  There are  
 about 60 members at present.
