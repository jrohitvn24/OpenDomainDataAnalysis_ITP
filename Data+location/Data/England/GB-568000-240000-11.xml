		<title>11The Endway.</title>
		<content> Down the Endway there are some        
 interesting groups of cottages.       
 Numbers 7,9,11 are a terrace of       
 cottages,the deeds of which go back to
 1745. They have 2 rooms downstairs:1  
 leading off the living room was       
 originally a pantry. There is a       
 lean-to at the back and 2 rooms 1     
 leading off the other upstairs. There 
 is another group of cottages which for
 many years were occupied by labourers.
 This terrace was locally known as Pot 
 Hall because of the unusually large   
 number of chimneys for 6 small        
 dwellings. Each one has twin chimney  
 stacks with double flues at the front 
 and single at the back. The cottages  
 are of red brick which could have been
 locally made. At one time one bread   
 oven was used by all 6 cottages.
