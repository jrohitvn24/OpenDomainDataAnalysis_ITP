		<title>19     Helping Africa</title>

    This year there has been a very bad
 famine in Africa and millions of      
 people are dying. This has been a     
 major{social concern}for many people. 
    We have been helping in several    
 ways. First of all we collected lots  
 of money in a jar which we sent to    
 help buy food and blankets to be taken
 to{Africa.                            
    As well as collecting for our own  
{harvest}we also collected lentils, dry
 peas, wholemeal flour and sugar. We   
 had to take them to Colchester and    
 load them onto the train which will   
 take the food to a port to be shipped 
 to Africa.                            
    We all feel very sad about what is 
 happening to the poor people in Africa
 and we hope that our food will help   
 save their lives.
