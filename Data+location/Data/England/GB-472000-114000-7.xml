		<title>07Farming in Chalton</title>
		<content> Most of the land in Chalton has been  
 taken over by fairly large scale      
 farms.{The major farming concern is   
{run from Manor Farm by the Budden     
{family who control an area of over    
{2000}acres. About one half of this is 
 used for wheat production the         
 remainder being split into growing    
 beans, barley, peas and rape.         
 Some livestock are kept the beef herd 
 varying between 60 and 120 head. Over 
 the past few years there has been a   
 gradual increase in the amount of rape
 grown.                                
 The whole farm only employs six full  
 time men, casual labour being hired on
 a limited basis when needed. A fairly 
 high degree of mechanisation is used  
 including four combine harvesters, two
 of which can tilt for use on hill     
 slopes,thus increasing usable land    
 area.                                 </content>
