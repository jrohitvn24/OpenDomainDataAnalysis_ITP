		<content>   In Chilton where we live we are     
 really very lucky because our village 
 is surrounded by countryside - fields 
 and woods. We can play hide and       
 seek down in the woods, make camps or 
 climb trees. There is a beck in which 
 we can plodge and make swings over the
 water. Sometimes we get thrown in!    
   When the weather is fine we can play
 on the swings and roundabouts in the  
 recreation grounds or ride our B.M.X. 
 bikes on the new track that has just  
 been completed near to the council    
 football pitch. Some children play on 
 their roller boots or their skate-    
 boards.                               
   If it is raining we have to go in   
 the house and read books or comics,   
 watch television or videos or if we   
 are lucky we may have a computer.
