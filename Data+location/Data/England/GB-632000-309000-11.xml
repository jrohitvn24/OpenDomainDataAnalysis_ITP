		<title>11FARMING IN BLOFIELD</title>
		<content>   Most farms in the Blofield area are 
 of at least 70 acres and concentrate  
 on growing wheat, barley and sugar    
 beet.  Other crops include potatoes,  
 peas and grass.  Most farms also keep 
 some livestock up to 100 animals      
 either pigs or cattle, and sometimes  
 goats.  The pigs are kept in special  
 pighouses and the cattle graze in the 
 fields.                               
   The farms have several tractors as  
 well as other machinery, such as      
 combine harvesters, balers for hay or 
 straw, sugar beet lifters and         
 sprayers.  The farmers use much       
 machinery, so do not employ many farm 
 labourers.                            
   The soils are rich and the farmers  
 get good yields of crops by using     
 fertilizers and sprays to kill weeds  
 and pests.
