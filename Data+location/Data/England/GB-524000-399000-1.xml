		<title>01VILLAGE AT FOOT OF THE WOLDS</title>
		<content> Brigsley, a village laying at the foot
 of the Lincolnshire Wolds with a      
 population of some 293. Mostly        
 agricultural in land layout, but few  
 of the inhabitants earn their living  
 from the land. Most are employed in   
 industry on the South Bank of the     
 Humber or in the commerce of Grimsby  
 or Cleethorpes. Brigsley could be     
 termed a commuter village. The houses 
 are a mixture ranging from a 16th     
 century thatched cottage to renovated 
 farm dwellings to modern suburban type
 houses, some mock period. Amenities   
 are few, a typical village food shop  
 and a not so typical ladies dress shop
 and a family run garage. The only     
 centre of entertainment is a village  
 hall used by the Youth Club and by the
 elderly once a month. The spiritual   
 needs of the villagers are in the care
 of a mostly Norman Church.            </content>
