		<content>      This Block is made up of{gently }
{rolling countryside}which is sharp    
 contrast to the very hilly regions    
 which surround it on three out of the 
 four sides.                           
      In the{North East}is the oldest  
 corner of the{Village of Williton,   }
 including the Parish Church.   In the 
{North West}are the very interesting   
 remains of the{Cistercian Abbey of   }
{Old Cleeve.   }                       
      The remainder of the area is     
 taken up with{farmland of a very      
{productive nature. } And, apart from  
 the corner of Williton, settlement is 
 very thin and scattered.              
     There are some{large estates.    }
 One of the most interesting being at  
{Orchard Wyndham.}  The Wyndham family 
 having played an important role in the
 development of this area over a number
 of years.                             </content>
