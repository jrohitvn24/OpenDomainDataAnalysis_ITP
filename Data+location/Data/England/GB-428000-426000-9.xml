 go down to Jenny,s or she comes up.We 
 play on our bikes then we usually go

 house we usually have salad.Then we   
 sometimes go swimming we duck each    
 other under  and practice how many

 of my favourite films we would watch  
 the normal television and have some   
 sweets and a cup of tea or coca.Then  
 we would play games and some times    
 like Guess Who? or Connect Four.      
 After we would have some supper like
