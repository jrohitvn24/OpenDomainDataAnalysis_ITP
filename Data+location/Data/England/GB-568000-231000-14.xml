		<title>14Arable farming</title>
		<content> The main machinery that the farmers in
 this area use are tractors, trailers, 
 muck spreders, ploughs, cultivator,   
 harrows, seed drill, rollers,sprayers,
 fertilizers, combine harvesters,      
 balers, forage harvesters and potato  
 harvesters. Farms produce oats,       
 barley, wheat and potatoes so we can  
 eat the food that they grow. September
 is when farmers burn their stubble but
 when the wind starts blowing the wrong
 way the fire can start burning trees  
 and other crops that have not been    
 harvested. There are things that      
 people don't like about spraying as   
 well because some people think that   
 spraying damages plants and flowers.  
 When farmers burn their straw and     
 spread manure the smell isn't very    
 nice. The dust from harvest is        
 horrible because the dust makes people
 get hay fever.                        </content>
