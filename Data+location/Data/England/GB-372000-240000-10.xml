		<title>10Darick Plastics Ltd. Colwall</title>
		<content> Making use of a building that was once
 a fruit cannery, a firm called Darick 
 Plastics Ltd. set up in Colwall some  
 12 years ago. Employing a workforce of
 19, they manufacture reinforced       
 plastic mouldings for use in industry.
 The plastic is reinforced with spun   
 glass. A major product is large       
 water-proof containers for delicate   
 instruments which are ordered by the  
 electricity boards, and water boards  
 etc. A good market has been           
 established in the Middle East, where 
 despite dry weather, instrument       
 housings made of metal corrode        
 quickly. Another product is a         
 deflector used on large lorry cabs to 
 improve aero-dynamics and thus reduce 
 fuel costs. A modern type of hut is   
 also manufactured in which paint is   
 incorporated with the plastic to      
 reduce maintenance costs.             </content>
