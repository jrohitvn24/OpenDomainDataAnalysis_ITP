		<content>    We talked to a Forest Ranger and to
a Countryside Ranger to find out more  
about the fallow deer.                 
    The fallow deer of the Chase are   
truly wild, for herds roamed the area  
long before the first Domesday Book was
written and the Chase created.         
    The herd is maintained at about 300
animals, the limiting factor being the 
amount of winter keep that is          
available.                             
    Deer can cause damage to young     
trees by eating the young shoots and   
leaves, and by the bucks rubbing their 
antlers on the lower branches. In      
winter they can also destroy crops when
they invade neighbouring farmland in   
their search for food.                 
    The main danger to deer comes from 
traffic using the roads that cross the 
Chase, and many are killed or injured  
each year.                             </content>
