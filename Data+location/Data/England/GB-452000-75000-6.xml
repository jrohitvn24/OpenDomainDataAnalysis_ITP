		<content> The{Botanic Gardens}was once the Royal
 National Hospital for Diseases of the 
 Chest.The gardens,one of the finest in
 the country, is a big tourist         
 attraction as it contains more than   
 10,000 plants including many rare and 
 beautiful species used to a warmer    
 climate. There are{banana trees}which 
 unfortunately were badly hit by the   
 unusually severe winter of 1984/85,   
 however, there is evidence of a new   
 growth of about five young trees      
 again. There are also{camellias}and{  
{Yuccas}and Lord Mountbatten planted a 
 very special oak tree here. A pretty  
 gold-fish pond with a fountain and    
 water-lilies is in the middle of a    
 lovely rose garden. There is a cafe   
 here, and overlooking the rose garden,
 is the hospital library now  housing a
 gift shop. Further along is an        
 adventure playground.                 </content>
