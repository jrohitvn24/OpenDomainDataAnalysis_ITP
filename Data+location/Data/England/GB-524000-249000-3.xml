		<title>03The Brasses.</title>
		<content>     The brasses in the church are     
 unusual, not in appearance but in     
 their number. Due to the isolated     
 position of the area, the soldiers of 
 Oliver Cromwell's army, who destroyed 
 much in other local churches, failed  
 to find them.                         
     There are five brasses in good    
 condition and dedicated mostly to     
 members of the Cockayne family who    
 were the local landowners.One is      
 very interesting in that the lady who 
 figures on it, Lady Ida Cockayne, is  
 featured wearing a butterfly          
 head-dress, a fashion which was very  
 short lived and therefore enables     
 historians to date the monument around
 the early 1400's.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
