 IN THE 1840S A LINE WAS OPENED BETWEEN
 DEREHAM AND KINGS LYNN BY THE GREAT   
 EASTERN RAILWAYS AND WAS SITUATED ON  
 THE DUNHAM ROAD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF   
 GREAT FRANSHAM.                       
                                       
 THERE WAS JUST ONE PLATFORM SERVING   
 BOTH DIRECTIONS WITH TWO PORTERS      
 (GRADE 1 &amp; 2)>   THE GATE ACROSS THE  
 DUBHAM/FRANSHAM ROAD WERE OPERATED    
 MANUALLY AND THERE WAS A SIGNAL BOX   
 ACROSS THE TRACK FROM THE STATION     
 MASTERS HOUSE/TICKET OFFICE.          
                                       
 THE LINE EVENTUALLY WAS TAKEN OVER BY 
 BRITISH RAIL AND TRAINS WERE CUT TO A 
 LESS FREQUENT SERVICE AND FINALLY WAS 
 CLOSED IN 1969.   THE HOUSE WAS       
 RECENTLY SOLD AND IS USED AS A HOLIDAY
 COTTAGE.
