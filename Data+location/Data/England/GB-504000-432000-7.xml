		<title>07Orchard Park Estate - Ideal?</title>
		<content> Orchard Park Estate was planned in the
 early 1960s and built in the late     
 1960s and early 1970s. {Dream houses }
 were built for people moved from the  
 damp and decaying terraces of the 19th
 century inner city suburbs.           
 Very high density modern terraces with
 small gardens, coupled with a dozen or
 so high and medium rise tower blocks  
 has allowed the feeling of open space 
 once away from the houses.  Grassed   
 hillocks and generous rose beds along 
 the main roads and around the under-  
 passes give an air of freshness.  No  
 industry nor chimneys pollute the air 
 near to the open countryside.  Four{  
{villages, the Shaws, the Thorpes, the 
{Danes and the Courts}each have a      
 primary school, and no through traffic
 is allowed as the access roads are all
 cul-de-sacs for motor traffic.  The   
 early day tenants were quite happy.   </content>
