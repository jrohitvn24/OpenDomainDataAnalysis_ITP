		<title>02Children's Names-A Survey</title>
		<content>   First we had to find  out which     
 names were popular about ten years    
 ago.We tried to find out which was    
 the most popular name among the fourth
 year juniors, but we found that there 
 were not enough children to give us   
 a reasonable sample.So we used third  
 year childrens' names too.Then we     
 listed all the girls' mums' names and 
 the boys' dads' names to find out     
 which names were used thirty to forty 
 forty years ago.Lastly our local vicar
 told us the names of the children     
 christened in the last two years.     
 The most popular name for baby boys   
 was Christopher and for baby girls    
 was Hannah.The most popular names in  
 in the third and fourth of our school 
 for girls are Joanne and Claire and   
 for boys is Stephen.The most common   
 mothers' name is Susan,and for        
 fathers, it is John.                  </content>
