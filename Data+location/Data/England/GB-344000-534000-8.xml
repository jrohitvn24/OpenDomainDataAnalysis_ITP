		<title>08HUTTON ESTATE - DEER</title>
		<content>   Most of the deer on the estate are  
 roe deer, and it is estimated that the
 resident population is about 80 head. 
 They frequently move about because of 
 disturbance.  Furthermore, they damage
 young trees.                          
   The estate has a policy of culling  
 the deer to ensure a healthy stock and
 to keep damage to trees to an         
 acceptable level.  This is now mainly 
 done by Mr M Fitzpatrick of the       
 Leeming House Hotel.                  
   Very occasionally a red deer stag   
 can be seen - one was seen in Dukes   
 Wood in 1980.  No doubt they are      
 roaming from Martindale to Askham     
 Fells.
