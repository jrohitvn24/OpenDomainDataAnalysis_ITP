		<content>{September 1980}Residents of houses    
 overlooking an unused part of the     
 Cemetery complained about an area     
 adjacent to their gardens being used  
 as a tipping ground. "No Tipping"     
 signs were then erected.              
{October 1980}A local newspaper article
 reported that vandalism had resulted  
 in Â£10,000 of damage being caused.    
 Some gravestones over 100 years old   
 would cost over Â£100 each to repair.  
{June 1983}Emergency drainage pumps had
 been brought into the Cemetery to     
 prepare the ground for the funeral of 
 a local Falklands hero killed at Goose
 Green.                                
{October 1984}A letter appeared in a   
 local newspaper complaining about the 
 cost of grave headstones which had to 
 be supplied by Stockport Council's own
 mason.
