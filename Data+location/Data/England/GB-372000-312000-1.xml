		<content> The area is predominantly rural with  
 population being centred in the       
 villages of Sheriffhales in the S.E.  
 and Lilleshall in the N.W. There are  
 several farms which are given over    
 primarily to dairy cattle. The        
 landscape is mainly undulating with a 
 general rise towards the S. and the   
 old East Shropshire coalfield. Up     
 umtil the beginning of the 20th.      
 century the land was owned by the Duke
 of Sutherland and many of the older   
 houses retain their character although
 an influx of newer 'outsiders' has    
 meant much alteration and renovation. 
 Although many people are still        
 connected with farming a large number 
 of the newer inhabitants work further 
 afield in Shropshire and the West     
 Midlands. The National Sports Centre  
 at Lilleshall Hall is well known much 
 further afield.                       </content>
