		<title>13The Miners' Strike Doncaster</title>
		<content> The first question I asked was{"Did   
{you go on the picket lines?"}Andrew   
 answered{"Yes I did but I didn't use  
{violence - it just made things worse."
 Then I asked{"Did you and your family 
{ever get free food or clothing?}He    
 said{"No, not clothes, but we did get 
{a free food voucher for three pounds  
{to spend at the supermarket. And you  
{could also get a free large sack of   
{potatoes from the Miners' Institute   
{Centre."}                             
                                       
 I helped them with sacking the        
 potatoes and looking after them on a  
 night. It earned us a little bit of   
 extra money. It had a great effect on 
 our family because we all became      
 closer and helped each other more, but
 now the strike is over the family has 
 drifted apart a bit again.
