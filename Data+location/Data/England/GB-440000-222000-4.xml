		<title>04A Child's Life on the Farm</title>
		<content> Katherine Ruth Woods (aged 7) has     
 lived at Leys Farm for 3 years. She   
 and her brother are two of the dozen  
 children in this area. Her father     
 Geoff is the stockman for the Barton  
 Abbey Estate and her mother Sue is a  
 part-time district nurse. She has to  
 be taken to school by car as it is    
 over a mile away, in Middle Barton.   
 She will do reading, art work, number 
 work, writing, PE and listen to a     
 story at school, and she also has her 
 dinner there. Her mother collects her 
 at 3.00, and takes her home to watch  
 her favourite TV programme or she goes
 to play with a friend, until tea at   
 5.30. She goes to bed at 7.00, or for 
 a treat at 7.20 if her mother is      
 listening to 'The Archers' on the     
 radio!
