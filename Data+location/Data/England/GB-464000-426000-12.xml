 Playground Games                      
                                       
 Here are some of the games we play at 
 Camblesforth C.P. School.             
  Lines  In this game we use the lines 
 painted on the playground for Netball.
 The game is played like 'Tig', someone
 is "on". They stand in the centre and 
 count to ten and then try to catch all
 the players. You are only allowed to  
 run along the lines.                  
  Boo  This game is played round a wall
 on the playground. The person who is  
 "on" shuts their eyes and counts to a 
 hundred. The players keep out of sight
 behind the wall and try to remain     
 unseen throughout the game. If the    
 person who is "on" sees them she      
 shouts "Boo" and the person seen      
 becomes the new "on".
