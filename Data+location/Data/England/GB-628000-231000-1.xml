		<title>01    Welcome To Felixstowe!</title>
		<content>Welcome to Felixstowe.I am your tourism
guide.We are on a double decker bus    
which has an open top.You should be    
able to feel the wind in your face.The 
engine has started up, can you feel the
bus shaking? We started off at the bus 
station and we are going into Sea      
Road.I can smell the salt already,can  
you? The bus has stopped. Feel the     
sand,water and stones. If I take you   
nearer to the sea you will hear the    
waves splashing on the ground. Can you 
hear the people talking and chattering?
At the docks, if you listen you can    
hear the horn of a ship leaving the    
port. Can you hear the lorries going   
past and smell the fumes? Now we shall 
go to the amusements and Charlie       
Mannings' Fun Fair. Look at the        
laughing clown, isn't he jolly!        
Listen  to the machines whirring, and  
the people laughing and screaming!     </content>
