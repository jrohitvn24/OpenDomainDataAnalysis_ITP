		<title>01 Farming in Tamworth (One).</title>
		<content>                                       
 A farmer's job is to grow food for his
animals and food for people. Around    
Tamworth some farmers grow oats, oil   
seed rape, wheat and barley. The       
animals he keeps may be cows and sheep.
 {Oil seed rape} in the field looks    
yellow all over because of the yellow  
flowers. As a seed it looks like       
little balls. These are crushed to     
make oil.                              
 You can make breakfast cereal such as 
Oat Crunchies and porridge from the    
{oat} seed the farmer plants in his    
field.                                 
 Most of the {barley} the farmer grows 
is taken to market to be sold to food  
manufacturers. The farmer keeps some   
of the barley behind and feeds it to   
his animals.
