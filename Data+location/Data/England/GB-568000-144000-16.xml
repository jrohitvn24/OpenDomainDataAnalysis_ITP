		<title>16SALE OF FARMS</title>
		<content>When farmers get into financial        
difficulties they may have to sell     
their farm. Some farms can be sold as a
whole but some are too large or too    
expensive (perhaps 250000 pounds) to be
sold to one buyer and are therefore    
subdivided. In the process of          
subdividing the farm is split into     
field units and sold to individual     
buyers. An existing farm may perhaps   
double in size if the owner buys       
several field units from neighbouring  
farms. Farmhouses and oasthouses are   
often sold separately                  
 One farm was being sold while we were 
doing the Domesday Project. The        
farmhouse was sold to a London doctor. 
Another farm is up for sale including  
an oasthouse suitable for conversion.  
The farm consists of 101 acres and is  
up for sale in 3 lots. The farms are   
usually sold by auction.               </content>
