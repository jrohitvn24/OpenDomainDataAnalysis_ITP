		<title>12GAMES AT HOME</title>
		<content>      At home I usually play with my{  
{board games.}These are games using a  
 dice and moving counters around the   
 board. There are many different types 
 of board games.                       
      I often play with my{doll's      
{things.}She has a wardrobe, bed and   
 dressing table. She has many different
 cloths to wear.                       
      I like playing{sevenses}against  
 the wall in our porch. You have to    
 throw the ball seven times underarm   
 against the wall, overarm six times,  
 five bounces, underleg four times,    
 bounce so the ball hits the wall three
 times, throw it to the bottom of the  
 wall twice and finally throw it up and
 catch it.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
