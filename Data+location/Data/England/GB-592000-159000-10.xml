		<title>10SCHOOL GAMES IN LYNSTED</title>
		<content> We play{sticky-glue}at school.        
 Somebody has to be 'IT'. You make up a
 'HOME' base like the school fence or a
 bench. The person who is It has to    
 touch the others. If you are touched  
 you have to stand in a starshape,     
 still as a statue with your legs open.
 To free someone you have to crawl     
 between their legs. People used to    
 play this game a lot. It is a very    
 famous game. Even the Infants play it.
 Another game is called{Filmstars.}    
 Caroline Golding made it up. One      
 person thinks of the initials of a    
 filmstar. The others stand in a line 3
 metres away. The first person to run  
 up and give the right answer wins. If 
 you arrive at the same time as someone
 else you guess a colour. To make it   
 harder you can run there &amp; back &amp; back
 again. This means you have to guess   
 well &amp; run fast!                      </content>
