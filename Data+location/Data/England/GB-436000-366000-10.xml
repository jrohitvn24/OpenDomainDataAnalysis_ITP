		<title>10NEW HOUSING IN WINGERWORTH</title>
		<content>  In Wingerworth 3 new housing estates 
 are being built by SNW, Tarmac and    
 Adlington. We asked the sales         
 representative at Tarmac these        
 questions: {                          
{                                      
{What was the site used for before  you
{started building?                     
 It was a field that was once part of  
 Wingerworth Hall                      
{                                      
{When did you start building?          
 April 1984, we plan to be finished in 
 2 years.                              
{                                      
{How many houses are going to be built 
{and of what type? }                   
 200 houses                            
     2 and 3 bedroomed semi-detached   
     3 bedroomed detached
