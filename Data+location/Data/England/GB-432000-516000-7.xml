		<title>07SADBERGE ROAD SAFETY PATROL</title>
		<content> Mrs Holland is our crossing patrol    
 lady but we call her our "lollipop    
 lady"because the stick she uses to    
 halt the traffic with while we cross  
 the road looks like a giant lollipop. 
 Mrs Holland gets up at 7.30am and is  
 ready to go out to do her job  by     
 8.30.She wears a white coat and hat so
 that motorists can see her easily     
 especially on a dark mornings in the  
 winter.Her lollipop stick is black and
 yellow and has the words in big       
 letters.{STOP CHILDREN CROSSING.}Mrs  
 Holland sees all the children across  
 the busy road at 9am,12 noon,1pm,3pm  
 and at 3.30pm. After the end of the   
 afternoon school Mrs Holland's job is 
 finished for that day.
