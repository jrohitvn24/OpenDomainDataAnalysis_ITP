		<title>02TABRUMS FARM</title>
		<content> Comprises 390 acres, present owners   
 have farmed it for 47 years as a mixed
 farm.  Growing barley, wheat, rape,and
 potatoes.  4 years ago, 80 acres was  
 drained for grass which feeds 50 beef 
 cattle Hereford Charolais. Each year, 
 6 cows are purchased at two years old.
 Before the cows can be served for the 
 first time by the bull, they have to  
 be served by a hired Hereford bull    
 because Charolais calves are too big  
 for first time mothers. Additionally, 
 turkey farming starts on 19th July    
 with 1000, day old chicks, increased  
 on 1st  September to 1500. They own a 
 300 H.P.tractor which cost Â£60,000 and
 ploughs 80 acres in 1 day, 4 times the
 average. They also have twelve stables
 and barns. One barn holds 1000 tons of
 grain. It is said that the farm has   
 been there since the Norman times, so 
 it was probably in the Domesday Book. </content>
