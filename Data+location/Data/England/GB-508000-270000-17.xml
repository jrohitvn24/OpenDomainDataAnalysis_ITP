		<content>   Obviously such a sparsely-populated 
 rural area has no major sports'       
 facilities.  Residents who want squash
 and tennis courts or swimming pools   
 must seek them outside their immediate
 neighbourhood, and many do so.        
                                       
   The only organised sport within the 
 area takes place on the playing field 
 at Catworth, where the village        
 football team plays its matches, but, 
 at a less energetic level, the        
 'Manchester Arms' public house fields 
 teams for pool, table skittles and    
 darts.                                
                                       
   Riding, cycling and walking are all 
 popular with local residents, while   
 small children enjoy the playgrounds  
 at Catworth and Stow Longa, which are 
 provided and maintained by the local  
 community.                            </content>
