		<title>08Sutton Bingham Reservoir</title>
		<content> The former Yeovil Borough Council     
 completed the reservoir in 1954, on   
 land purchased from farmers, etc; and 
 the undertaking is now vested in the  
 Wessex Water Authority. Where this    
 land is not actually flooded, the     
 farmers are able to lease it back, but
 there are very strict limitations on  
 its use - no ploughing, grazing only  
 by sheep, no herbicides nor           
 nitrogenous fertilisers. The reservoir
 is quite attractively landscapd but   
 unfortunately public access is        
 extremely limited. Only anglers       
 holding licences from the Water       
 Authority are allowed on its banks    
 (some also use boats). There are few  
 places where the water can even be    
 seen from the road, let alone         
 approached. There is a sailing club   
 which uses the lower (northern) end,  
 but this is outside the block.        </content>
