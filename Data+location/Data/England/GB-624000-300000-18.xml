		<content> In 1086 a freeman held 12 acres.There 
 were also 6 slaves,3 ploughs, some    
 woodland,40 pigs,2 acres meadow,4 head
 of cattle,80 sheep. Many villagers    
 worked on the land or owned very      
 little. 12 acres was worth 40         
 shillings.Plus tax at 12d.The first   
 date of the church in Poringland was  
 Norman.Since then it has hardly       
 changed. The stained glass windows are
 medival. The registers of baptisms,   
 marriages and burials date from 1560. 
 An e.g. '1666 Robert Pratt the miller 
 kill'd by a fall from the mill sails  
 was buried.' Also 20 shillings 4d.    
 collected for ransom of slaves in     
 Turkey. One prominent family during   
 this time the Cursons  who owned      
 Blackford Hall. Mary Tudor gained her 
 strongest support from this area. By  
 1863 a range of trades was practised, 
 e.g. carpenter, 3 policeman, engineer.</content>
