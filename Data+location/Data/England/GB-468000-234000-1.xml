 The area around Buckingham is mainly  
 rural,and is considered by most pupils
 to be quite a pleasant place to live. 
 The town itself is mainly residential,
 although it lacks any large department
 stores,and most people shop elsewhere 
 for anything but food. Few people work
 in Buckingham,but have to use their   
 own transport to get to work,since    
 public transport is poor. There are   
 good facilities for recreation,such as
 the swimming pool and sports fields.  
 There are also activities such as     
 plays,school fetes and the occasional 
 circus and fair,so people who live in 
 villages consider Buckingham to be    
 quite busy. Recently,quite a large    
 number of students from overseas have 
 come to study at Buckingham           
 University,the only private University
 in the country.                       </content>
