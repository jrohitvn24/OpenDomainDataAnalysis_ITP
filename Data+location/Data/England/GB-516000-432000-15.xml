		<title>15WYTON</title>
		<content> Wyton is situated on the road from    
 Bilton and Sproatley. It was found by 
 John De Wyton. There is a big hall in 
 the background but nobody lives in it.
 It is falling down and the windows are
 smashed. Most of the buildings in     
 Wyton are bungalows and there are some
 big houses which people live in. There
 are three farms and one chapel. There 
 are 45 houses and bungalows           
 altogether.                           
 Wyton is such a small place that there
 are no shops at all in Wyton and the  
 people who live there have to go into 
 Bilton for their nearest shopping     
 facilies.
