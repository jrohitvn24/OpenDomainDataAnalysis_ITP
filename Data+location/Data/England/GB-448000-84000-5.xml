		<content>{Robbie Taylor writes:}My family have  
 farmed on I.W. for 400yrs and we have 
 been at Hill Farm for 200yrs. Today we
 rent from the Clarke family in Sussex 
 because they bought Hill Farm from my 
 family in 1920's. Our farm is worked  
 with Perreton Farm at Arreton which we
 own. The new barn (photo) is the first
 new building for 300yrs. It took four 
 days to put up the frame and four more
 to add the roof and sides. It replaces
 one burnt down which had 1107 carved  
 on the beam. The farm is 400 acres. We
 grow wheat and barley, field beans for
 cattle food, grass for hay and silage.
 Most of the corn we mill and feed to  
 the pigs at Perreton but some goes by 
 boat to Europe for malting. After this
 year we are not having any more beef  
 cattle so we will not be making silage
 but we will make some hay for the     
 sheep and the ponies.                 </content>
