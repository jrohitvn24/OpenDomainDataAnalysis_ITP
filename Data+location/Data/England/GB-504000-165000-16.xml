		<content> Chertsey's existence was established  
 by the founding of an Abbey, and      
 Frithward has been regarded as it's   
 great benefactor and founder.         
 The town name 'Chertsey' was          
 established before the Abbey was      
 founded.                              
                                       
 'Ceortey-ige' or '-ege' was the       
 original Saxon name for Chertsey. This
 indicates that the original settlement
 was an island, belonging to Cerota.   
                                       
 By 666 A.D. the name had been changed 
 to 'Cirotes-eye' and similar versions 
 are 'Cerota's Eye and 'Sirotes-egt'.  
 These lead to the modern name Chertsey
 in 1668.
