		<title>14ELECTRICITY</title>
		<content> Electricity came in in the 19th       
 century.It was not invented it was    
 discovered. Electricity is very       
 popular here in 1985. And it is       
 powerful and important too.Electric-  
 ity is used a lot round the home. Lots
 of electric things are coming in too  
 like microwave ovens came out about 2 
 years ago. 100 years ago you didn't   
 have any electric ovens,T.V.s or      
 anything.It must be quite hard to live
 back 100 years ago. Electricity is    
 very powerful so powerful that it can 
 kill someone. Electricity is very     
 useful round the home. You would not  
 be able to have videos,computers,dish-
 washers,fridges,telephones,TVs,radios,
 door bells.If you never had           
 electricity I don't think many people 
 could live without it.
