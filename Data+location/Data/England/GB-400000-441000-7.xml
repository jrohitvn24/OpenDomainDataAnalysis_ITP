		<content>  This farm has a milking parlour which
 holds ten cows.The cows are milked    
 twice daily at 6.00am and at 5.00pm.  
  Milk production is now limited by    
 milk quotas.This came into effect last
 year when milk production was limited 
 to the amount produced in 1983.The    
 milk quota at this farm is 404,000    
 litres per year.The milk is taken by  
 tanker to the main Milk Marketing     
 Board Depot at Leeds.                 
  In 1983, a Government grant was      
 obtained to support the reclaiming of 
 an acre of moorland which is now used 
 for grazing.A building for housing    
 farm machinery was also supported by  
 the Government.                       
  Sheep are grazed on the rough        
 moorland and in Autumn the fattened   
 lambs are sold at Bingley Auction     
 Mart.
