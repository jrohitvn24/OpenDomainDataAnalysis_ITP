		<title>20FARM FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> Most of the families of{Capernwray    
 either live on a farm, house or       
 building that has been converted into 
 a cottage or house.One family in this 
 position are Elsie and Tony Askew.    
 They are a brother and sister         
 partnership who farm about 200 acres .
 They milk about 50{Fresian dairy cows 
 and also have about 150{Swaledale     
 sheep. Their house is common of the   
 area, about{200 years old}and quite   
 large. It has five bedrooms, bathroom 
 and a toilet upstairs a big kitchen a 
 living room and a large dining room   
 downstairs. Because the house is so   
 old the rooms are quite low so anyone 
 above 6'2" would have to mind their   
 head.
