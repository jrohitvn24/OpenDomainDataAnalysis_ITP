		<content>{There are three councils,Suffolk      
County Council,Suffolk Coastal District
Council and Felixstowe Town Council.   
This year Mr Mumford is the Mayor.     
Landguard is the most southern part of 
Felixstowe. Near the Common the soil is
very sandy with pebbles. When rain     
falls it quickly drains away.In these  
conditions we find Vipers Bugloss,Sea  
Holly, Sea Campion, Sea Pea, Yellow    
Horned Poppy, Marram  Grass and banks  
of tamarisk where butterflies like     
Skippers,Holly Blue and Wall Brown can 
be watched on summer days. The birds   
seen at Landguard include whitethroats,
blackcap,garden warblers,nightingales, 
redstarts and meadow pippets. Little   
Terns nest on the beach. The Suffolk   
Trust for Nature Conservation has      
converted an army lookout to a bird-   
watching hide.Felixstowe Information   
Bureau can give the Warden's address.  </content>
