		<content>         Although this is an           
 agricultural area, vey few local      
 people are employed on the farms.     
 Large farms which once employed       
 between twenty and thirty full time   
 workers are now run efficiently with  
 three or four men. There are a number 
 of women employed part time at two    
 intensively managed poultry farms.    
         In Dorset as a whole there are
 more people employed in education than
 in agriculture, and this is true of   
 Winterborne Kingston, since there are 
 many people working full or part time 
 in local state and independent        
 schools. For other employment people  
 have to travel to Blandford, Wimborne 
 or Poole where skilled work is        
 available. The army camps at Blandford
 and Bovington and the Atomic Energy   
 Establishment at Winfrith employ men.
