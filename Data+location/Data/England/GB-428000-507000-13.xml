		<title>13CROFT NEW VILLAGE HALL 1985.</title>
		<content>   For many years a timber hut served  
 as a centre for village activities.   
  The hut began to reach the end of its
 useful life and activities either     
 ceased or transferred to the new      
 school accommodation.                 
  In May,1983 young villagers asked the
 Parish Council to consider the need   
 for a new Village Hall, primarily to  
 provide for Youth activities. A       
 committee under the chairmanship of   
 Bill Chaytor was formed to consider   
 the possibilities.                    
  Through the generosity of Mr. David  
 Kellie-Smith, monies were made        
 available from his mother's estate to 
 help a worthy cause. The Executors    
 assessed the committee's proposals,and
 agreed they would provide financial   
 help.A new prefabricated hall has been
 chosen. Final arrangements have been  
 made for completion this year(1985).  </content>
