		<content>   Most of the land in our block is    
 used for{farming.}The land is quite   
 fertile, lying in the valley of the   
 River Blythe. The type of farmland is 
 fairly evenly divided between         
{intensively managed grassland}for hay,
 silage and grazing, and other crops.  
 These are mainly{wheat}and{barley,}but
 also quite a lot of{oil-seed rape}and 
 a variety of minor crops such as kale.
   A typical farm is{Station Farm}which
 is farmed by Mr.J.Johnston. It covers 
 140 acres and is a mixed dairy/cereal 
 farm. The milk is sold to the Dairy   
 and the cereals are also sold. Some   
 land is used to provide grass for the 
 cattle.                               
   There are 2 main{game preserves}in  
 the area. One is in "The Bogs" near   
 Berkswell and the other is in the     
 woods bordering Bickenhill Lane at    
 Hampton-in-Arden.                     </content>
