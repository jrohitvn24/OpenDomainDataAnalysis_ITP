		<title>01River Test Estuary Gazetteer</title>
		<content> The Domesday Block 04360111 surrounds 
 the estuary of the River Test. The    
 North Eastern corner consists mainly  
 of l930s privately owned housing and  
 some light industry. Towards the West 
 is the Millbrook Housing Estate and   
 the upper tidal reaches of the River  
 Test with surburban Totton in the     
 extreme West.                         
 There is an area of dockland along the
 North bank of the Test. This is       
 bordered to the North by the          
 Southampton_Bournemouth railway line, 
 running East/West with an industrial  
 estate between it and the Millbrook   
 Road (the western entrance to         
 Southampton).                         
 South of the river is a muddy tidal   
 coastland with rough pasture and      
 farmland beyond. Eling village is the 
 focal point of the mid west with      
 forest land in the south west corner. </content>
