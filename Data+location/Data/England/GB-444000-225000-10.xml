		<title>10Steeple and Middle Aston</title>
		<content> The area is in the parliamentary      
 constituency of Banbury and under the 
 Oxfordshire County Council. The local 
 authority is the Cherwell District    
 Council and the area falls within the 
 responsibility of the Steeple Aston   
 and the Middle Aston Parish Councils. 
 St. Peter's Church in Steeple Aston   
 was built in the 13th century and     
 remodelled in the 14th and 15th       
 centuries. It has interesting         
 architectural features and is actively
 supported by the modern congregations.
 The Steeple Aston Cope, the greatest  
 treasure of the Church, is now on     
 permanent loan to the V. &amp; A. Museum. 
 It is the remains of a 14th century   
 cope, a good example of English work, 
 and remarkably well preserved.
