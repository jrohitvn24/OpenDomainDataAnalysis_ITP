		<title>14BERWICK CHURCH, NR ALFRISTON</title>
		<content> The present church of St. Michael and 
 All Angels was built about the middle 
 of the 12th Century on an existing    
 barrow.  The Saxon font belonged to   
 the 'Conquest Church' and on the wall 
 nearby are marks where bowmen         
 sharpened arrows on Sundays before    
 practising archery.  Bombs dropped in 
 the 1939-45 war destroyed the church  
 windows and Bishop Bell decided this  
 catastrophe presented an opportunity  
 for using artists' work on walls      
 instead of windows.  This resulted in 
 decoration of the interior by Clive   
 and Vanessa Bell, their son Quentin   
 and daughter Angelica and Duncan      
 Grant.  Local people were used as     
 models in religious and Sussex scenes 
 and the murals were dedicated in      
 October 1943.
