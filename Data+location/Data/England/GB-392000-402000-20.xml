		<title>20Questionnaire _ Summary</title>
		<content>   The questionnaire that was carried  
 out was done in the small village of  
 Lees,near Oldham.It is a  small       
 community,not really representative of
 the town.there are very few           
 non_English people in the village.    
   If the survey was carried out in    
 Oldham there would have been a large  
 percentage who visit a mosque or other
 places of worship not associated with 
 an English town.This is because of the
 large Asian and Eastern European      
 community that is an integral part of 
 the town.                             
   The survey itself is very           
 interesting.It shows that about one   
 third of the community still attend   
 some form of church,at least once a   
 month, something that would probably  
 not be true in a larger town.
