		<content> With an approx.area of 2,lOO acres    
 Maghull is bound by Sefton to the west
 and Melling to the East, Lydiate to   
 the North and Aintree to the South.   
 At the l98l census the estimated      
 population was 24,5OO but the trend   
 appears to be a fluctuating one as    
 labour leaves and arrives in the area.
 Since the end of the last war new     
 residential developments in the town  
 have added to the amenities whilst at 
 the same time the town has retained   
 its semi-rural atmosphere.            
 Maghull continues to preserve its     
 individual life as a small but        
 thriving community, attributed largely
 to the comprehensive range of clubs   
 and societies etc. which allow        
 residents to pursue their interests   
 without recourse to the city's        
 facilities.
