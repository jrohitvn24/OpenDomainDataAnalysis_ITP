		<content>{I am Bronia Williams}and on Tuesdays I
 go to Girl Guides. We do various      
 activities working for badges. Most   
 years we go camping in the summer. We 
 wear a neckerchief around our necks.  
 It is held in place by a leather strap
 called a woggle.                      
{My name is Kathryn Evans.}I have two  
 sisters and two brothers. My mum and  
 dad are divorced and I live with my   
 mum. She does not work. My two        
 brothers live in London. I take after 
 my dad's side of the family. I was    
 born in Wales and brought up in       
 London.                               
{I am Kathy Charlton.}My mum and dad   
 both work. My Mum in a bank, and my   
 dad on aeroplane design. My hobby is  
 collecting pictures of Princess Diana.
 My pets are a dog, a rabbit and a     
 fish. My brother's hobby is bird      
 watching.                             </content>
