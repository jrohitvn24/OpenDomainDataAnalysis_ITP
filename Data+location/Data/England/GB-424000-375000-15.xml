 One day Rachel and I went to see{Mr.  
{Mycock the butcher.}Sadly Mr. Mycock  
 was out so we interviewed{Mr. Nailer  
{one of his}helpers. He told us that   
 he's worked there for{39 years.       
 We asked him what it's like to work in
 a butcher's shop he said, "Very       
 pleasent." He told us that Friday is a
 busy day." Mr. Mycock only employs{two
{people.}Mr.Nailer would not like to   
 work as anything else. The shop opens 
 at 7 a.m. and closes at 5.30pm.They   
 order the meat from F.M.C.            
{  Interview     Mr. Warrwick    Grocer
 Mr.Warrwick has served in this shop   
 for{twenty years.}Nowadays people buy 
 only small quantities from the village
 shop. Twelve years ogo they bought    
 larger quantities.  As this is a      
 village shop I sell  bits of          
 every-thing.                          </content>
