		<content> Two independent groups of the WI are  
 associated with Warbleton; one now    
 with 31 members meeting  afternoons   
 and the other (the authors of this    
 survey) having l5 members and meeting 
 evenings. Both groups meet monthly in 
 the Dunn Village Hall. Meetings       
 usually consist of an invited speaker 
 (with fees of Â£5-Â£10 plus expenses)on 
 any subject except politics and       
 religion,including in l985 nature,    
 cookery,history and antiques. After a 
 social break there is discussion of   
 local social issues or wider regional,
 national or international issues of   
 particular relevance to women.Only 3  
 of our members live in this Domesday  
 area. Many members combine being      
 housewives with part/full time jobs   
 e.g.farmers wives, physiotherapy,     
 secretaries,teaching, astronomy and   
 ballet teacher to the Royal family.   </content>
