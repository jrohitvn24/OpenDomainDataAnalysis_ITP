		<content>  Teachers have been{in dispute}for    
 so long recently that some things that
 usually happen ,haven't. The problems 
 of today with the pupils at{St.Johns  
{Comprehensive School}are family life  
 and insecurity. The Headmaster's      
 feelings are that these aspects are   
 the cause of trouble at home and      
 school. The number of pupils attending
 was{1,300}but now it's{1,076.}Out of  
 35 forms in the school there is a 100 
 strong sixth form.                    
 Those leaving at 16 go to further     
 training or get a job. 12 leavers may 
 be{unemployed.}Small businesses around
 Epping employ many young people.The   
 girls like going up to London for a   
 job as a typist or a secretary in     
 spite of the high fares.              
 St.John's has an eye to the future.   
{Economics}and{computing}are subjects  
 of the eighties.                      </content>
