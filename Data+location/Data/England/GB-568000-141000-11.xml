 All Saints Church Horsmonden          
 This Church was built just over 100   
 years ago as an Anglican Church and   
 was sold to the Roman Catholic Church 
 in the 1970s and masses are held on   
 each Sunday and Holy Day the priest   
 coming from Goudhurst

 as an alternative to the parish church
 of St. Margarets which was on the site
 of the old village of Horsmonden

 as The Heath and villagers wanted     
 their church nearer but its           
 congregation returned to St. Margarets
 when more of the population had cars  </content>
