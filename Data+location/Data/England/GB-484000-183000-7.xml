		<title>07HINDHAY FARM, MAIDENHEAD.</title>
		<content>   Hindhay Farm is really an arable    
 farm, which means that they mainly    
 grow crops, however, they also keep   
 some live-stock.                      
   We were shown around the farm by    
 Nigel Findlay. The total acreage of   
 the farm is 380 acres, which is used  
 as follows:                           
           Winter wheat   200 acres    
           Spring barley   20 acres    
           Winter barley  100 acres    
           Potatoes        50 acres    
           Grass           10 acres.   
   The farm keeps both cows and        
 bullocks. There are four bullocks,    
 which are a Fresian and Hereford      
 cross. They only have a small herd of 
 twelve cows, they are also a Fresian  
 and Hereford cross. Hindhay Farm also 
 works with the farm next door,        
 Pinkneys Farm.
