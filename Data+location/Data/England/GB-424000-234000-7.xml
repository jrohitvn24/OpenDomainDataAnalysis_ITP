		<title>07Health in the Wolfords</title>
		<content> The Wolfords and Todenham are served  
 predominantly by Doctors from Moreton 
 in Marsh and Shipston on Stour but    
 also from Chipping Norton.            
 Para-Medical services include district
 nurses, Health visitors, Meals on     
 Wheels which are delivered by         
 voluntary workers, and home helps.    
 There are cottage hospitals at Moreton
 in Marsh and Shipston on Stour. Both  
 these Hospitals provide 24 hour       
 Casualty cover. Serious cases are     
 referred to Oxford, Banbury,          
 Cheltenham and Warwick. Ambulance     
 cover is from Gloucestershire         
 and Warwickshire. There  are two      
 day centres, one in Moreton and one in
 Shipston. These enable elderly or ill 
 patients who live at home to receive  
 occupational therapy, physiotherapy,  
 baths and meals and in doing so,      
 give their relatives a rest.          </content>
