		<content> Many places in Devon are 'twinned'    
 with places in other countries, but   
 particularly with France.             
 Stokeinteignhead is twinned with      
 Trevieres and Combeinteignhead is     
 twinned with Osmanville. Both these   
 villages are in Normandy.             
 The twinning associations organize    
 visits to their twin village, usually 
 one a year. In the village hall at    
 Stoke there is a charter hanging on   
 the wall, written in both French and  
 English which explains the purpose of 
 twinning. In July l985 a group of     
 children from Stokeinteignhead will   
 visit Trevieres with the French       
 children returning the visit in       
 August. The twinning associations hold
 regular social and fund raising       
 meetings to help pay for the expenses 
 of the respective host village.
