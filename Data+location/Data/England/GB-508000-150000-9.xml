		<content> St Teresa's Convent is a fee-paying   
 Roman Catholic school but girls of all
 denominations are accepted.  Founded  
 in 1928 there are now 360 pupils aged 
 11 - 18 years, of whom 140 are        
 boarders with other pupils daily      
 travelling from homes up to 20 miles  
 away.  Some of the boarders are       
 English often with parents abroad on  
 business; others are foreign nationals
 - Chinese, Lebanese, Nigerian, Spanish
 etc., whose parents wish them to have 
 an English education.  Fees for a day 
 pupil are currently about Â£600 per    
 term.  A very broad based curriculum  
 encompasses all the arts and sciences,
 as well as a secretarial course.      
 There are excellent sports facilities.
