 a Beaver Colony for boys under eight, 
 two Cub packs for 8-11 year olds, two 
 Scout Troops (Boys 11-16), one Sea    
 Scout troop and also a Venture Scout  
 Unit for Boys who are sixteen.Usually 
 by the age of 21 those who have       
 remained have been recruited as       
 helpers for the other units.          
   The group is the responsibility of  
 Mr.Paul Weeks who both co-ordinates   
 activities and runs the Cub Packs.    
 During their time in the various packs
 or troops the boys are engaged in both
 indoor activities at their            
 Headquarters and numerous camps.      
   Parents help to arrange fetes etc.  
 to raise money for equipment.
