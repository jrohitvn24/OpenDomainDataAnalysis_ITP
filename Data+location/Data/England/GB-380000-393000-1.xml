   Squares 11 and 12 are almost equally
 divided between open space and        
 housing.                              
   A great variety of different types  
 and quality of housing is found in    
 these squares.There is a small part of
 a large coucil estate in square       
 12.Quite close by are large detached  
 and semi-detached houses and another  
 zone of smaller semi-detached         
 houses.In square 11 the houses are    
 very different being partly modern -  
 inter-war semi-detached and partly    
 older 3 storey Edwardian houses       
 arranged in pairs and fours.There is  
 also a small area of older terraced   
 housing,possibly late Victorian.
