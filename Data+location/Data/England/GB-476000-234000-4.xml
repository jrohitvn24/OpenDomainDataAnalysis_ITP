		<content> The population is concentrated in the 
 villages of Beachampton and Nash. For 
 the purpose of this survey a part of  
 Beachampton and Wood End in Nash is   
 excluded. There are 151 dwellings     
 which include two public houses and   
 the farms.                            
 The population is 430 but there is    
 some increase in the summer when the  
 farmers employ extra staff. The       
 approximate ratio of ages of the      
 residents is as follows:              
           Nash    Beachampton         
   0- 4     21           4             
   5-16     47          28             
 17-60     167          69             
 over 60    41          20             
 Some families have lived locally for  
 generations many of the older         
 residents having spent all their life 
 in the villages. The new houses in    
 Nash have attracted young families.   </content>
