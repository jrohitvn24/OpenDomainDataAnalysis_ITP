		<title>11INDUSTRY IN SOUTHPORT</title>
		<content> In our area there is little heavy     
 industry apart from three metal       
 works,three power works and one       
 chemical works.Most of Southport's    
 trade is concerned with the leisure   
 industry,light manufacturing and light
 engineering.                          
   Perhaps our best known food         
 manufacture is"Famous Names Ltd"which 
 is situated at Virginia St.They       
 manufacture a range of sugar          
 confectionery including               
 Chewits,Goodies and the Parkinson     
 Range.The site employs about two      
 hundred and fifty  personnel.The      
 company originated as the Arthur      
 Holland Company founded in 1885 and   
 has occupied the present site since   
 the 1920's.                           
   There are twenty one garages in our 
 area,the largest being Holland Motors 
 employing 80 people.                  </content>
