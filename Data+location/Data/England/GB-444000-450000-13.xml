		<content>   A day in the life of Helen Wilson.  
   A typical day for me begins at      
 6.30am when my alarm clock rings.     
 While I eat my breakfast of cereal,   
 toast and orange juice, I watch "Good 
  Morning Britain" or a video cartoon  
 on the television. I get washed,      
 dressed and pick up my packed lunch.  
 Mum gives me a lift to school in the  
 car. I have time to meet friends in   
 the playground before lessons begin at
 9 o'clock. Our morning lessons include
 English, maths and science, and       
 assembly when the whole school meets  
 in the hall.                          
   After an hour for dinner and play,  
 we have art and craft, reading and    
 sometimes a game of rounders on the   
 field. At 3.30 we walk home. I go to  
 ballet and tap-dancing. After that,   
 youth club and then home to watch TV  
 and finally to bed at 9.30.           </content>
