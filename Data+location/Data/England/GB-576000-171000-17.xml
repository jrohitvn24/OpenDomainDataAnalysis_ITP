		<title>17Housing In Hoo.</title>
		<content> The old village of Hoo has been       
 greatly enlarged to a population of   
 over 8000 with the contruction of new 
{housing}estates since the 1950's.     
 Growth results from proximity and good
 access to London and the Medway Towns 
 as well as the develpoment of major   
 industrial concerns nearby.Houses of  
 all types can be found in the village 
 terraced, semi_detached and detached  
 as well as prefabricated homes around 
 Hoo Marina.  Housing styles have      
 changed greatly over time and recently
 favour the mock_Georgian. There is a  
 growing trend towards private         
 ownership rather than rented          
 accommodation, as well as improving   
 provision for the car and a growing   
 interest in DIY or{home maintenance.
