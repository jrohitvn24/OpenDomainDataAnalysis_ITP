		<content>Mr Addis has been at Geddington School 
for 7 years.                           
He usually arrives here at 8.15am and  
on a normal day returns home at about  
5.30pm. His present class of 18 is the 
smallest he has ever had. His favourite
event during the year is the Christmas 
Production. He also likes Mathematics. 
Mr Addis is very grateful to the       
Parent's Association for raising money 
for the school.                        
The football teams he has trained have 
never been poor. His most severe       
punishment now is a smack; before      
children had the slipper.              
Other jobs Mr Addis does are unblocking
drains and getting tennis balls off the
roof.
