		<title>19PEEL HALL HOSPITAL IN L/H</title>
		<content> In this Psycho-Geriatic Hospital there
 are 38 patients cared for by 30 nurses
 and a number of visiting doctors. The 
 patients are old, confused and        
 somewhat demented. Although the       
 hospital is equipped, patients are    
 sometimes sent to Salford Royal or    
 Prestwich if their condition requires 
 special treatment. Patients are       
 encouraged to exercise regularly. Many
 enjoy a walk along the magnificent    
 hallway, up the impressive staircase  
 and past the remarkable stain glass   
 window. Others walk in the grounds and
 some venture to the local shopping    
 precinct with the help of the nurses. 
 Men and women are not encouraged to   
 mix except on special occasions such  
 as Christmas or for special birthday  
 parties. There are not many visitors  
 and so the staff have to be           
 exceptionally caring and dedicated.   </content>
