		<title>06WITHIEL FLOREY CHURCH</title>
		<content> In the hamlet of Withiel Florey stands
 a lovely small country church built   
 in 1693. The incorporated church      
 building society made a grant to      
 repair the church upon condition that 
 all sittings be free and that an      
 annual collection be given to the     
 society.                              
 Only one service a month is now held  
 in the church, that for July 1985     
 being Holy Communion at 3pm on        
 Sunday 14th.                          
 The history of this small church shows
 very clearly how the population of the
 area has declined and looking round   
 the graveyard you see many gravestones
 bearing the same family names. The    
 most recent being a grave  of a man   
 aged 84 who was buried here in 1981.  
 Althouh very isolated the church seems
 well cared for and was clean and tidy 
 each time we visited it.              </content>
