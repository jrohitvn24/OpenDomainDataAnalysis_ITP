		<title>05Wetwang,Harvest on the Farm</title>
		<content>       Harvest on the farm is one of   
 the most busy times for the farmer and
 everything has to be right to get a   
 good crop.                            
      Everything depends on the weather
 and if it is a long wet summer like   
 this one in 1985 then the harvest goes
 on and on.                            
      The corn has to be ripe and dry  
 before it can be combined but once    
 this has been done then the corn goes 
 into the corn cart and is taken to the
 drier.It goes through a number of     
 stages there.First it goes into the   
 pit and then through a hole in the    
 bottom of the pit and up a pipe to a  
 machine that sorts out the grain from 
 all the rubbish.The rubbish goes into 
 sacks which are thrown away when full 
 and the grain goes up another pipe    
 into a big bin where it is stored.
