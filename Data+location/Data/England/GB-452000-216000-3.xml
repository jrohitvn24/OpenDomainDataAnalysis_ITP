		<title>03Ecology of Weston and Area</title>
		<content> Though cultivated, the area has plenty
 of trees and some large hedges which  
 provide cover for wildlife.  Little   
 owls, tawny owls and sometimes long-  
 eared owls breed locally.  Deciduous  
 trees in Weston Wood provide roosting 
 and nesting ground for a colony of    
 rooks and jackdaws.  The old hazel    
 coppice at Wormough is a haunt for    
 chiff-chaffs and willow warblers and  
 foxes and deer also find cover there. 
 Kingfishers and green sandpipers are  
 occasionally seen on stream banks and 
 kestrels hover above the rough road-  
 side vegetation in search of vermin.  
                                       
 Wormough is covered by primroses,     
 bluebells and wood anemones in Spring.
 Rare orchids and other plants can be  
 found in a few old meadows. Some 150  
 species of plants have been recorded  
 along the railway wildlife sanctuary. </content>
