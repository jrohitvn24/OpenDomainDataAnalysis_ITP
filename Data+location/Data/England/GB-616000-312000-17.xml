		<title>17EMPLOYMENT,DRAYTON AREA</title>
		<content>    This area is traditionally a rural 
 farming community,but has recently    
 seen a great change in the            
 distribution of population and in the 
 types of jobs of members of the       
 community, the main employers now     
 being the{service industries.}Many    
 people are employed by the large local
{building firm,}Carters, as well as    
 the{Norwich Union Insurance company.}A
 reasonable number are self-employed, a
 few work at the local hospitals,whilst
 nearby{Norwich airport}provides some  
 employment as well as access to       
{off-shore oil and gas rigs.}Locally-  
 employed skilled workers include      
 carpenters, printers and{shoe-makers, 
 the latter having a long association  
 with the Norwich area.The area has not
 suffered much from{unemployment}which 
 reflects the{prosperity}of Norfolk and
 Drayton's {middle-class}structure.    </content>
