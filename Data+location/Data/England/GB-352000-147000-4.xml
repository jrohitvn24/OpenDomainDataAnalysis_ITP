		<content>                                       
 THE RIVER AXE GOES UNDERGROUND AT     
 PRIDDY,FLOWS THROUGH WOOKEY HOLE CAVES
 AND BY THE CAR PARK AND PICNIC AREA.  
 IT FLOWS OVER LOTS OF STONES AND WEEDS
 BUT THERE ARE FEW FLOWERS.  IN THE    
 STREAM THERE ISN'T MUCH WATER-LIFE TO 
 BE SEEN BECAUSE IT WOULD PROBABLY BE  
 HIDING IN THE WEEDS.IT IS NICE AND    
 PEACEFUL TO JUST SIT BY THE RIVER AND 
 LISTEN TO THE RUNNING WATER.          
                                       
 LOCAL BOYS ENJOY FISHING IN THE       
 RIVER BY THE CAR PARK AND AT TROUTS'  
 BEND WHERE THE RIVER GENTLY WANDERS   
 ALONG WITH DEEPS AND SHALLOWS, LINED  
 BY TREES AND ECHOING THE SOUNDS OF    
 BIRDS.                                
    ON AND ON, GOES THE RIVER, PAST    
 FIELDS AND HEDGES,GRAZING CATTLE AND  
 PEACEFUL SOMERSET SCENERY.
