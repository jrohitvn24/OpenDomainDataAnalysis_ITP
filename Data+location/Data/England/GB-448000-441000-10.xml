		<title>10TADCASTER BY-PASS</title>
		<content>   Tadcaster was until 1978 an         
 extremely congested town , especially 
 in summer when traffic from Leeds and 
 surrounding areas was on its way to   
 the Yorkshire Coast.                  
                                       
   A by-pass for Tadcaster was first   
 mentioned during the 1930's but no    
 plans were published until 1972.      
 There were two public inquiries to    
 consider various routes and to hear   
 objections and a final decision on the
 road was not made until early 1975.   
 Construction work started in 1976 and 
 two years later in August 1978 the    
 by-pass was opened. The cost of the   
 road was Â£8.5m.
