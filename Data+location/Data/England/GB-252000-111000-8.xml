		<title>08THE NORTH DEVON CLAY COMPANY</title>
		<content>     The works of{The North Devon Clay 
{Company},situated to the west of our  
 block,are of major importance in terms
 of land-use and employment.42 people  
 work there to extract Ball Clay.      
                                       
     First dug in the 17th.century,the 
 clay is used today in products as     
 diverse as china,paint,pesticides,soap
 and tyres. Countries to which it is   
 exported include Finland,Greece,India,
 New Zealand and U.S.A.                
                                       
     In the last 50 years the workforce
 has been reduced by two-thirds due to 
 the introduction of mechanization and 
 the closure of the Marland Brickworks.
 The distinctive yellow bricks,still to
 be found all over North Devon,together
 with the clay were once dispatched on 
 a recently closed railway line.All    
 products are now sent away by road.   </content>
