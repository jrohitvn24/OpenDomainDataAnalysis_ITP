		<title>08Great Houghton Church</title>
		<content> The{church}is the oldest,standing     
 building in{Gt. Houghton.}It was built
 in 1650 as a Chapel of Ease by{Sir    
{Edward}Rodes,High Sheriff of          
 Yorkshire.Mr.Edward Bowles, of York,  
 one of the most eminent of the        
 Presbyterian clergy, performed the    
 first religious ceremony in the chapel
 when he baptised one of his           
 younger sons.  The patronage of the   
 chapel depended entirely on the Rodes 
 family and it had no endowment other  
 than theirs and was always strongly   
 Presbyterian. The area of Gt.Houghton 
 is 1649 acres.In 1801 the population  
 was 257, in 1901 it was 1220, in 1965 
 it was 2424 and now it has reached    
 well over 3000.When we phoned Mr.     
 Moulder, the curate, he told us that  
 24 people went to church on Sunday    
 morning,and 40 in the evening.
