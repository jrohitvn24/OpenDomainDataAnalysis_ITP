		<title>18HOLIDAYS AND LEISURE TIME</title>
		<content> Being located close to the river and  
 the sea much of the leisure and       
 recreational activity is of a nautical
 nature.There is also quite a          
 concentration of holiday accommodation
 towards the western end of the block. 
 This is pricipally in the form of     
 caravans parked on permanent          
 sites,together with holiday chalets.  
        The area is a centre for       
 sailing and there are large numbers of
 small sailing vessels to be seen on   
 the River Blackwater during the summer
 months.In June from the sea wall a    
 visitor could also watch the annual   
 'Barge Race' for the old sailing      
 barges,which starts at Maldon proceeds
 down the river to the open sea and    
 then back to a finish in Maldon.At    
 Goldhanger the creek offers a mooring 
 for small vessels should people wish  
 to visit the village.                 </content>
