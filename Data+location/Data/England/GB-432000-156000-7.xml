 A TYPICAL BOY>                        
  My name is Guy Terry. I am 9 years   
 old. I live in a modern house. It is  
 built of brick and has a tiled roof. I
 like to play with the computer. I have
 three meals a day, breakfast,dinner   
 and tea. I go to school at 9 o'clock  
 and I go home at 3.45. We have school 
 dinner in the village hall, but on    
 Saturday and Sunday I have dinner at  
 home.I have a brother,Mark. He is     
 seven. I have 2 bicycles but one is   
 very rusty. I have my own bedroom and 
 I own a little patch of garden to grow
 plants.
