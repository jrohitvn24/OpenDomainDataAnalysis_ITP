		<content> Dunstable Park Recreation Centre is   
 one of the largest centres in the     
 country and is used by approximately 1
 million people a year who travel there
 from miles around.Our survey showed   
 that women between 25_35 use the      
 centre more frequently during the day 
 and men between 16_25 during the      
 evening.Swimming was found to be the  
 most popular activity followed by     
 squash. In the winter however bowls   
 takes second place for popularity.The 
 park area is lawn, shrubs, herbaceous 
 plants and formal bedding. Surrounded 
 by the town,there are many trees both 
 broadleaved and conifers.             
 Invertebrates,birds,amphibians        
 and small mammals live there.People   
 relax in the park using  the tennis   
 courts,swings and benches.Vandalism,  
 litter and glass are problems.Grove
