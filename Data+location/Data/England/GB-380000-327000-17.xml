		<title>17Economics in Eccleshall</title>
		<content> The economy of Eccleshall is that of a
 farming community with associated     
 facilities. The Midland Bank and      
 National Westminster Bank offer       
 services in a helpful and friendly    
 small branch atmosphere. Walters and  
 Welch are the local solicitors and are
 agents for two building societies.    
 There are four estate agents: Barber  
 and Son, Owen Bennion, John German and
 Robert S. Heywood, all of whom are    
 agents for different building         
 societies, as is Trent Insurance.     
 Eccleshall Post Office has National   
 Savings Bank and National Girobank    
 facilities and employs six full-time  
 postmen of great character who deal   
 cheerfully with the hazards of country
 roads and their attendant animals.    
 Copmere End has a small post office   
 with similar facilities.
