		<content>     The first church built on this    
 site was probably Saxon.It was built  
 in 1001 by the Abbess of Shaftsbury.  
 The original door and some of the     
 walls can still be seen.In 1220 the   
 north porch was added,and some of the 
 graves are from this time.In the      
 1300's the tower was built on.Much    
 later,in 1596,a bell was purchased and
 still rings today.There is an unusual 
  wall pulpit of stone,probably built  
 around 1520.After the Reformation in  
 the 1530's the church became a ruin(in
 1578 it was described as a "ruined    
 chapel").It was gradually restored and
 given a new roof in 1849,with a       
 gallery for singers and musicians at  
 the west end.Later an organ was       
 installed.In 1921 a south aisle was   
 added in memory of Limpley Stoke men  
 who died in the  First World War.
