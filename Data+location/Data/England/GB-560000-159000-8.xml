   Some common animals inhabiting the  
 Country Park and it's surrounds are   
 foxes,rabbits,voles,grey              
 squirrels,weasels and stoats.There are
 some badger sets in the park but none 
 of them are used however some do live 
 in the neighbourhood and visit the    
 park in their search for food.There   
 are some adders in Trosley but they   
 are so shy that it is very unlikely   
 that they would do any harm to        
 humans.Another common creature is the 
 pipistrelle bat which can be seen at  
 dusk flying along the glades  and     
 among the tree tops hunting for       
 gnats,moths,and beetles.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
