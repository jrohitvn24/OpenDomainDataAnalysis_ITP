		<title>20Negative Attitudes</title>
		<content> Adults often say that local children  
 nowadays have no respect for anyone or
 anything.It is true that many swear,  
 shun adult advice,are rowdy,cycle with
 impunity on pavements and in other    
 public places where cycling is banned,
 drop litter,write on walls,damage     
 public property,take drugs and steal, 
 but perhaps no more than in previous  
 generations.Many adults commit the    
 same offences.Family break-up is      
 increasing.Many children live with one
 parent or neither.Many live with a    
 step parent or other parent-substitute
 cohabiting with the natural parent.   
 Sexual permissiveness is increasing.  
 The attitude to work is worsening,in  
 part because of waning job prospects. 
 Nearly a quarter of households keep a 
 dog,and excrement is deposited without
 consideration for others on footpaths 
 and in public parks.                  </content>
