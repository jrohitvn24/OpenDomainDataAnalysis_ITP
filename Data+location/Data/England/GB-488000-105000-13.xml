		<title>13TANGMERE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village was first mentioned in the
 Domesday Survey 1066 and is thought to
 be Saxon in origin. The name is saxon 
 and means a pool at the junction of   
 two ancient paths.  The pool is no    
 longer in existence having been filled
 in to become the village green. The   
 village remained unchanged until the  
 20th century when it was chosen as a  
 site for an aerodrome. With the 1st &amp; 
 2nd World Wars, Tangmere was used as a
 RAF fighter base.  Douglas Bader the  
 legless flying ace was based at       
 Tangmere and the only Village pub     
 bears his name today.  The RAF left   
 Tangmere in 1967 and the airfield     
 became deserted. Today the disused    
 runways are bordered by wheat and the 
 outer buildings are being demolished  
 as the airfield has been sold t0 a    
 private developer. The village is on  
 the threshold of change.              </content>
