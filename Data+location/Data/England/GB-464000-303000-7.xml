		<content> Some foxes appear to be changing      
 their way of life.Some residents are  
 encouraging these animals by putting  
 out scraps for them.These urban foxes 
 can be seen regularly between dusk and
 dawn crossing gardens in search of    
 food.                                 
 Another matter causing concern in the 
 area is vandalism.Unfortunately there 
 is far too much.Schools,youth clubs   
 and community centres seem to bear the
 brunt of such attacks,which is        
 surprising as the vandals who have    
 been caught are of school age or have 
 just left school.Premises have been   
 broken into,windows smashed and       
 property stolen.This week we heard    
 that the police had caught the        
 culprits responsible for damaging our 
 school.
