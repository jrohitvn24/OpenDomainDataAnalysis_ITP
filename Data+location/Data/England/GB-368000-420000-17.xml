		<content>  Darwen Station is now the only manned
 station between the larger towns of   
 Blackburn and Bolton.There used to be 
 a station at Spring Vale,which closed 
 in 1958.Spring Vale station opened in 
 1847,the year in which the line from  
 Blackburn to Sough was completed.     
  The 1850 metre long Slough Tunnel was
 opened a year later in 1848.Tunneling 
 had been carried out from both ends.  
  Five people died during              
 construction.The youngest of these was
 12 year old Billy Godbhere,who was    
 knocked down the deepest of 13 shafts 
 which had been sunk to remove material
 from the tunnel.
