		<title>11A FAMILY OF FOUR AT CATLOWDY</title>
		<content> We grow our own vegetables.Husband    
 shoots rabbits and pheasants on our   
 land.We keep hens for eggs and meat.I 
 make our own wholemeal bread,cakes and
 biscuits.Milk &amp; newspapers delivered. 
 We make one or two trips a week to    
 Longtown by car and buy things we     
 don't produce ourselves               
 e.g.petrol,coffee,flour,dairy         
 foods,cleaning materials &amp; some meat. 
 We also buy things at our local Post  
 Office/shop and draw Family Allowance 
 there.We only shop in Carlisle if ee  
 have an additional reason for going.We
 always try to achieve several         
 objectives when we go out in the car  
 as petrol is expensive.Although       
 supermarkets in Carlisle are generally
 cheaper than in Longtown,the round    
 trip is almost forty miles.For corn   
 for the hens,fence posts,building     
 material,we go to Longtown or Carlisle</content>
