		<title>12WARRINGTON ACADEMY</title>
		<content>{The Warrington Academy                
     In 1757 a private house was       
 converted into a science academy. It  
 was the first of its kind in the      
 country and was considered to be one  
 of Britain's most important           
 educational institutions. It was      
 closed down in 1786 through lack of   
 financial support and remained closed 
 until 1899, when it was re-opened and 
 used for a time by the local Literary 
 and Philosophical Society.            
    In 1981 the Academy came back into 
 the news when it was resolved either  
 to demolish it or move it for a       
 road-widening scheme. It was moved    
 about 75 feet north on rollers and    
 grease-pads to its new resting place  
 at the foot of Bridge Street. The     
 Academy is now used by the Messenger  
 Newspaper (U.K. Ltd.)                 
                                       </content>
