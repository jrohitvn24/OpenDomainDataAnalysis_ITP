		<title>12New House Farm.</title>
		<content> As part of the survey we decided to   
 visit a farm in our zone.We went to   
 New House Farm, Sibdon.               
    The farm is owned by Mr. and Mrs.  
 Bowen.                                
    First Mr.Bowen gave us a talk,then 
 we had a look around the farm.        
    Mr. Bowen has 90 acres of land,16  
 acres owned by him and 74 acres       
 rented.He does not employ any         
 workers relying on just a family work 
 force.The land mainly consists of     
 grassland which is used for grazing   
 and harvesting silage.Mr. Bowen only  
 uses one artificial fertiliser to     
 improve the land which is nitrogen.   
 There are 3 main buildings,a          
 farmhouse,barn and milking parlour.The
 parlour is called a herring bone and  
 can hold 10 cows at the most.Mr. Bowen
 has 70 British Friesians and 1        
 Hereford bull.                        </content>
