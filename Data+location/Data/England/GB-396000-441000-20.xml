		<title>20THE DOMESDAY PROJECT 1985</title>
		<content> Twenty-eight children from{Class 5    
 at{Cowling County Primary School      
 compiled all the data and helped with 
 the text of this project.They were    
 10 and 11 years old at the time.      
{Mrs.Mary Clough,Class Teacher,}and    
{Mr. Antony Coe,Headmaster,}were helped
 enormously by the childrens'          
 enthusiasm for the work,which included
 so much that it was impossible to use 
 it all.In addition to the entries     
 recorded,a lot of other valuable      
 work,including Art Work was produced. 
 All the children have been involved in
 seeing their own writing entered on   
 the text pages .                      
 Our grateful thanks to all the people 
 who helped us,including{Mr.Dennis     
{Clough,}who took the photographs. On  
{Tuesday 2 July 1985}we had a special  
 evening at school for 200 parents and 
 friends,who came to look at the work. </content>
