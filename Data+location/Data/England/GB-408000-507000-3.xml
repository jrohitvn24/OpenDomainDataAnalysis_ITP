		<content>  At 11.00 on Sunday 16th June we went 
 to Dalton village hall for the annual 
 fun run.We ran from{Dalton}to the{A66}
 and along it to the{A66 Motel}then    
 turned towards{Newsham,}on to         
{Barningham}and then up on to the      
 moors. There were a number of men at  
 points around the course acting as    
 marshals to make sure that everybody  
 went the right way.                   
  The course over the moors is hilly   
 and about 4 miles out of the total 10 
 miles.{Josie's mum}gave us some water 
 as we passed over the moor to{Silver  
{Hill}and back down to Newsham. I      
 walked a mile before reaching Newsham 
 and finished by racing the girl who   
 was with me,back into Dalton -she won.
  I came 2nd,{Jane Herring}and{Jayne   
{Parker}came joint 3rd,a stranger came 
 1st. My time was 1h 46m 6s.{Mr Metcalf
 presented the trophies.               </content>
