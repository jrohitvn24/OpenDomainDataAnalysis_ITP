 BUILDING AlM TUNNEL HATFIELD          
                                       
 AlM peak times congestion near British
 Aerospace factories needed easing, so 
 the new road - Stanborough to Roestock
 was begun l984 costing Â£55m  and      
 taking 3 years to construct.  A major 
 feature is the ll50m long 'cut and    
 cover' tunnel through which the       
 motorway will pass, so making the AlM 
 continuous through Herts.  Through    
 traffic will use the tunnel, leaving  
 the old roads for local traffic.  The 
 safety officer took my class into the 
 tunnel when it was being built.  We   
 had to stay close.  Moving machines   
 had flashing lights and men wore      
 safety helmets and bright jackets.    
 Muddy wheels on lorries were washed   
 before joining traffic.  The whole    
 area was fenced off from the public.  </content>
