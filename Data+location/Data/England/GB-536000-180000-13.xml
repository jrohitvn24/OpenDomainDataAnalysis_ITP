		<title>13St.Clement's Hospital</title>
		<content>St.Clement's provides the districts    
psychiatric service(except for 20 beds 
at Whitechapel).There are 145 beds for 
in patients,with plans to increase this
to 157 by 1988.Although there is an out
patients department,no facilities exist
for a day hospital.This is a serious   
shortfall in district services.New     
facilities for the occupational therapy
department are to be based in a former 
supplies building.Although various     
physical improvements are being made,  
St.Clement's is under threat of closure
Despite the pressure on its services,  
because it is a small hospital,the fear
is that it will eventually be absorbed 
into another hospital,probably Mile End
