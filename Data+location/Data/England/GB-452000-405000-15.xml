		<content>    On a typical day we have three main
 meals and some snacks in between. We  
 have breakfast in the morning,dinner  
 at lunchtime and tea in the evening.  
 Breakfast cereals are eaten with sugar
 and fresh milk which is delivered on  
 the doorstep in the morning in bottles
 by a man in a van. For dinner we might
 have a joint with vegetables, potatoes
 and Yorkshire pudding. Sometimes we   
 have a pudding or sweet like apple pie
 or a crumble of some kind.            
    Things like sandwiches and cake are
 eaten for tea. We keep foods like     
 cream, butter, milk, and cheese in the
 fridge because it keeps them cool and 
 stores them longer. A typically       
 English meal is fish and chips which  
 we get from a chip shop. It is a fatty
 meal because the battered fish fillet 
 and the chipped potatoes are deep     
 fried in fat then served in newspaper.</content>
