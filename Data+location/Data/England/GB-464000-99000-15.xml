		<content>   Situated near the Guildhall, this   
{beautiful park}has attractions for all
 ages. Its many trees include Chestnut,
 Lime, Sycamore, Poplar, Ash, Willow   
 and Beech. There are beds of roses,   
 tulips, forget-me-nots and pansies.   
 Two hot and steamy greenhouses contain
 tropical plants.                      
   There are{9 cages}of tame{animals   
 including peacocks, budgerigars,      
 tortoises, rabbits and guinea pigs.   
 Notices warn parents not to let       
 children put their fingers through the
 wires. One peacock will spread its    
 feathers when watched and if you are  
 lucky you can pick up one of the      
 feathers that has fallen out.         
   Around the park are{war memorials   
 and a fountain which was dedicated    
 at the opening in{1878.
