		<title>04HOUSES IN POTT SHRIGLEY</title>
		<content> Apart from a small new development on 
 the edge of Bollington, houses in Pott
 Shrigley are mosty cottages or farm   
 houses built of local stone in the    
 seventeenth and eighteenthcenturies.  
 The area is part of the Peak National 
 Park and strict development policies  
 have ensured sympathetic modernisation
 and extension of many properties. In  
 the adjacent area of Adlington, which 
 is in the north-east Cheshire green   
 belt, the position is similar but with
 some use of locally made brick in the 
 lower lying areas. There was a small  
 pre-war ribbon development of large   
 detached houses, some on double plots,
 allowing for some modern infilling.   
 The individual nature of properties   
 and the unspoilt rural setting makes  
 this a very desirable area for retired
 people and commuters to settle, with  
 very few working farmhouses remaining.</content>
