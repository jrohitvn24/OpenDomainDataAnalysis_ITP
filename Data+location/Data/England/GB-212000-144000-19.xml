		<title>19A Lundy childhood remembered</title>
		<content> there was singing of songs,sketches   
 and much jollity.                     
 This idyllic life came to an abrupt   
 halt when at the age of seven she was 
 sent away to boarding school. She was 
 unable to read or write but was an    
 expert on the habits of sea birds.She 
 confesses that she didn't learn to    
 tell the time until the age of        
 fifteen.Such was the irrelevance of   
 time on Lundy!
