		<content> Many people believe that there is a   
 gypsy buried under a boulder in County
 Lane. The gypsy got there because     
 Albrighton didn't have a magistrate   
 and criminals would cross the county  
 line to escape the law.Two gypsies    
 fought,one killed the other and       
 was later buried there.A boulder was  
 placed on the grave to mark the spot. 
 We have been told that beneath the    
 boulder bunches of wild flowers may   
 still be found.                       
                                       
                                       
 There is also an Albrighton fair. The 
 rose queen leads a procession of      
 floats through the village to a large 
 field at the end of the High Street   
 where we have stalls and arena events.
 Originally the fair was held in a     
 field in Station Road. The field is   
 now a housing estate.                 </content>
