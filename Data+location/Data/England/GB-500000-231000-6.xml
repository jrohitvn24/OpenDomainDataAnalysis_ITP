		<title>06LIFE IN TINGRITH</title>
		<content>  Tingrith is a tiny hamlet with a     
{population}of about 175. It is a very 
 quiet rural backwater with no shops or
 post office. There is a{Village Hall} 
 which houses the{Judo Club}on Monday  
 afternoons and the local branch of the
{Womens Institute.}The elderly         
 residents join with those of the      
 neighbouring villages of Eversholt and
 Milton Bryan for The{Triple Club}which
 is held in Eversholt.                 
  The Parish Church of St Nicholas is  
 of ironstone in the Perpendicular     
 style and was rebuilt in the late 15th
 century and restored in 1845. It      
 retains some early features such as a 
 10-sided 13th century font and early  
 Victorian stained glass. A painting   
 over the altar is said to be by Rubens
 and was presented by the King of      
 Holland.                              
                                       </content>
