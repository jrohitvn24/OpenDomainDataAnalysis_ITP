 A unique feature of Sedlescombe is the
 Pestalozzi Children's Village situated
 within the Parish. This is a branch of
 the original home in Switzerland      
 started by Pestalozzi after the Second
 World War.                            
                                       
 Within its village there is an old    
 manor house, and modern buildings each
 designed to hold a different          
 nationality. Children come from as far
 away as Vietnam and Tibet and are     
 educated in local Secondary Schools   
 but preserve their own cultures and   
 religions within their respective     
 homes.
