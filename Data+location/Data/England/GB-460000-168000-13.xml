		<content> There can be few parts of the         
 industrialised south-east of England  
 with as few amenities as this area.   
 Although the village of Sulhamstead   
 has a village hall, it has no shops,  
 sporting facilities, churches or pubs.
 The church at Sulhamstead Bannister   
 Upper End, which existed until        
 recently, consists now of nothing more
 than the porch and a short section of 
 the adjoining wall. Much of the       
 graveyard is overgrown. The other     
 church in the area is at Ufton Green. 
 It too is nothing more than a single  
 wall. The only public facility in the 
 area is the Three Kings: Jack's Booth 
 Public House. Many of its regular     
 customers walk three miles or more to 
 the pub. Most of the people who live  
 in the area use the facilities along  
 the A4 going into Reading for shopping
 and recreation.                       </content>
