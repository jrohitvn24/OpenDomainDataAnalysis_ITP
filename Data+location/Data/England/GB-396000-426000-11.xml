		<content> At 7.00 a.m.I start my day. I fold my 
 duvet back to air my bed, open my     
 curtains, cross the landing and go    
 into the bathroom. I put the plug into
 the washbasin and get washed with a   
 flannel. I dress, polish my glasses,  
 walk downstairs, put on my boots and  
 set off down the lane to get free     
 range eggs for my breakfast. Then I   
 take the dog out on the lead for a    
 walk.My mother drives me in the car to
 school. At school I play the tenor    
 recorder for Assembly. On Mondays we  
 always have Maths, English, P.E. In my
 free time I play sport. I am collected
 from school by my mother and driven to
 Halifax for my ballet lesson. I get   
 changed into a black leotard and pink 
 tights and pink shoes. Then I go back 
 home, plump up my pillow and go to    
 sleep.
