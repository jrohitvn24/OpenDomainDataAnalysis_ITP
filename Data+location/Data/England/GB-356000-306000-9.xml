		<title>09View from Charlton Hill</title>
		<content>  The landscape is best seen from the  
 high point of Charlton Hill. From here
 it is possible to see for miles across
 open countryside. There are few houses
 visible and the farm land and trees   
 stretch away in the distance.         
 The ground slopes gently down from    
 Charlton Hill to the valley of the    
 River Severn. Then there is a steady  
 rise in the ground up to the long     
 wooded outline of Wenlock Edge. This  
 leads on to the higher hills of Church
 Stretton in the distance. Turning     
 slightly to the west it is just       
 possible to make out the church spires
 of Shrewsbury but the buildings of the
 town are too far away to be seen      
 clearly.                              
  The landscape must have changed      
 little for many years.
