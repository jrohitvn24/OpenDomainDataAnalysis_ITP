		<title>18ST PETER'S  LODSWORTH</title>
		<content>  We entered the old{churchyard}by the 
{Lych Gate}and the Vicar welcomed us at
 the{Tower Door}and showed us the{Holy 
{Water Stoop}in the wall.We stood in   
 the{14th century bell tower}and looked
 up at the ropes. All was safe;the     
 bells were down but we didn't touch   
 the ropes.The oldest bells were cast  
 in 1602,1606,1648 and re-hung with the
 Tenor bell in 1890.The two lightest   
 were added in 1966.We walked into the 
{Nave}and looked at the roof beams.The 
 Vicar showed us the{Chancel,}the      
 place for singing. Tower,nave and     
 chancel form the ancient{St Peter's   
{Chapel, }served by priests from the   
{Augustinian Priory}at{Easebourne.     
 Up the lane to the north is{St Peter's
{Well.}People with eye troubles washed 
 themselves here, hoping to be healed. 
 This well pre-dates the chapel and was
 a place of pilgrimage for centuries.  </content>
