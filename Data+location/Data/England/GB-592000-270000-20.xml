		<title>20EDUCATION IN IXWORTH</title>
		<content>In Ixworth there is a voluntary Play-  
Group run for children from 3 to 5     
years. For a small sum parents can send
their children for up to three mornings
each week.                             
Officially every child must attend a   
school from its 5th birthday. In this  
part of Suffolk children attend a      
Primary School from 5 to 8 years old.  
From 9 to 13 they attend the Middle    
School and then they transfer to the   
Upper School at Thurston until they    
reach the legal age of leaving (16).   
Some pupils remain for two more years  
to take Advanced level Examinations.   
Most of these then go to Universities, 
Colleges or Polytechnics.              
Evening Classes are held for adults.   
Many of these are for leisure pursuits 
including foreign languages. Academic  
courses are held but these are usually 
at the West Suffolk College in Bury.   </content>
