		<title>04LORD COURTENAY'S FARM</title>
		<content>{Lord Courtenay's}farm is a very big   
 one.It has roughly 3700 acres of land.
 1200 acres of land are crops. Barley, 
 potatoes, corn,wheat,swede and peas   
 are grown.Of course machinery is also 
 on the farm.Stile Farm has 8 tractors,
 a combine harvester,rollers,balers and
 fertiliser spreaders.                 
          A lot of the land is used    
 for animals.They have,mostly, South   
 Devon cows and sheep.Some of the cows 
 are used for beef and the sheep are   
 sheared in the middle of May. They    
 have 5 workers,two of which are only  
 part time. Farmers have trouble with  
 rabbits and mice. Rats come from the  
 river and crows eat the crops. In the 
 winter animals and crops are put in   
 barns, cattle eat silage, barley and  
 hay,sheep eat hay,silage and root     
 crops.The E.E.C has affected their    
 farm,particularly increased paperwork.</content>
