		<content>    Halesowen is on the edge of the    
 Black Country, about seven miles from 
 Birmingham.                           
    The town has a popular and busy    
 traffic free shopping centre, serving 
 a wide area with plenty of free       
 parking.                              
    The 155 shops in the town centre   
 provide a variety of goods ranging    
 from food, clothes and household goods
 to jewellery and cars. There is also a
 mixture between family businesses such
 as Dancers, a family store established
 over a hundred years, to nationwide   
 chain stores such as Burtons,         
 Woolworths, Boots, Sainsbury's and    
 Presto.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
