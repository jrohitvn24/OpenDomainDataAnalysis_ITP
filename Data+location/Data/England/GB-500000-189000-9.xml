		<title>09Life in Chalfont St. Peter</title>
		<content>   During a shower and a shave at      
seven,Dad listens to Radio 4 and then  
rushes down to breakfast. We all have  
breakfast in a rush then dash off to   
school or work.                        
   Dad works at Chalfont Park.British  
Alcan is owned by a Canadian multi     
national company.Originally there were 
two big {aluminuim} {companies} but    
as  British {industry} declined there  
was not enough {business} for both.So  
they merged to make British Alcan.My   
father  helped to plan this merger.The 
new headquarters are in Chalfont       
St.Peter, so we had to move here.      
   This is not unusual 73% of my class 
werenÂ£t born here.Buckinghamshire is   
the fastest growing county in Britain, 
because the most prosperous part of    
England is the south east.             
   My father often works late.His day  
always ends with the midnight news.    </content>
