		<content> To visit is to step back in time -    
 apart from six cottages the village is
 owned by Earl Spencer. It consists of 
 a row of estate cottages with large   
 front gardens, mostly well cared for. 
 The Manor House and Gatehouse are     
 still lived in but the old house      
 adjacent to the gatehouse is          
 unoccupied and with a hole in the roof
 will soon fall into disrepair. The old
 schoolhouse still stands but not for  
 thirtyfive years has it been used for 
 teaching due to lack of pupils. It has
 been given to the village and is now  
 used as a village hall. Similarly the 
 one shop in the village, the post     
 office has closed. There is remaining 
 a telephone kiosk and a postbox. One  
 new bungalow has been built on the    
 hillside and three cottages have been 
 made into one and sold.
