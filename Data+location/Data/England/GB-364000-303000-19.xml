		<title>19THE IRONBRIDGE BY-PASS</title>
		<content>   There is going to be a by-pass built
 around Ironbridge. The by-pass starts 
 at the roundabout at Aqueduct, by-    
 passing Ironbridge to come out at     
 Buildwas and join the Shrewsbury road.
   There is going to be a car park     
 built off the by-pass so that the     
 tourists will have somewhere to park. 
 From the car park the tourists will be
 able to catch a coach to anywhere in  
 Ironbridge or Coalbrookdale free of   
 charge. The by-pass is being built    
 because of all the traffic that goes  
 through Ironbridge, so that when the  
 by-pass is built all the lorries will 
 not have to go through Ironbridge. The
 roads in Ironbridge were too weak to  
 carry all the traffic; the pavements  
 are too narrow for people to be safe.
