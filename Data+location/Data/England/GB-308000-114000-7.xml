 on the site of a former meeting house 
 erected in 1718.  It has unusual      
 Georgian windows and a colonnaded     
 entrance. In 1892 typical Victorian   
 windows were put in at the side and   
 back of the building and new pews in  
 the main body of the Hall.  There is  
 an unusual ceiling of 3 arcs and a    
 steeply sloping gallery on 3 sides,   
 which contains what are probably the  
 original narrow bench seats, with the 
 date 1703 scratched on one.

 with old stones, the earliest with the
 date 1753.The Prescott Lecture Room

 the village of Culmstock in 1889 at a 
 cost, including furnishings, of       
 Â£206.8s.0d. PRESCOTT and CULMSTOCK
