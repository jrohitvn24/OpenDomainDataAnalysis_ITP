		<content> Near La Moye Point is a cave that was 
 supposedly connected to St.Saviours   
 church by a subterranean passage.This 
 passage was supposed to contain a     
 table and drinking vessels of stone   
 and was one of the entrances to       
 fairyland.Because of this,the cave was
 avoided at night,which made it an     
 important hide-out for smugglers until
 the late nineteenth century.          
                                       
 Although the area was sparsley haunted
 and there are few reported            
 ghosts,travellers were loathe to pass 
 through the districts and a number of 
 crosses were set up to comfort anyone 
 who had to pass by.
