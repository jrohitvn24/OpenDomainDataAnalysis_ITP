		<title>06INTERVIEW WITH MR WISKIN</title>
		<content>Mr Wiskin told us he thought the fire  
was a terrible thing to happen but he  
is very pleased the building has been  
rebuilt.However many things couldn't be
replaced like letters,photographs,plans
and maps and teacher's work.He         
remembers the fire itself "Flames      
,thick smoke,the stones of the         
building were too hot to touch,plastic 
chairs melted like toffee."            
The fire was started by people who     
broke in to steal crisps and chocolate 
but their lighted match was dropped    
onto the floor.A fireman was hurt when 
he fell through the floorboards.It took
over a year to get the buildings back  
to normal.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
