		<content> There are very few jobs to be found in
the block it self.Most of the people   
who live there,work either in Stafford 
or the West Midland towns.Many are self
employed or in a profession.A small    
number are employed on the local farms 
or forestry land.A few are employed in 
shops/catering/public houses and       
garages in the area.                   
 The CHASE STUD is on Old Camp road.It 
has 16 acres divided into two          
paddocks.There are thirteen stables    
which includes a feed house to store   
food.There is a tack room for the      
riding things.There is a garage,hay    
barn and a ring where the horses are   
trained.There are 6 race horses;Outlaw 
Tixall Boy, Incandescence,Aldro,       
Covent Garden and Miss Millinski.      
Mr White bought the Stud in 1984.There 
are 10 Hereford heifers as well.
