		<title>08WARMINSTER'S ARMY WORKSHOPS</title>
		<content> The biggest single local employer is  
 "the REME" (Royal Electrical and      
 Mechanical Engineers 27 District      
 Workshop), with about 440 civilian    
 and 70 military staff, most of whom   
 live in the Warminster/Westbury area. 
 The workshop complex, covering a 1 km 
 by .25 km site, was originally built  
 in 1939, and used in the War by the   
 Royal Army Ordnance Corps, as well as 
 the US Army, before the REME took over
 in 1945. About 50 jobs are completed  
 by the workforce each day, mainly     
 repairs, ranging from simpler work on 
 local army equipment, through more    
 complex engine changes on a variety   
 of vehicles, to full tank overhauls.  
 All skilled trades have to serve a    
 full apprenticeship. 22 apprentices of
 different types can be trained at one 
 time, which means 5 trainees can be   
 taken on each year.                   </content>
