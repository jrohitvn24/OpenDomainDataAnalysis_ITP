		<title>10THE CORN EXCHANGE, NEWBURY.</title>
		<content> The Corn Exchange was built in 1862 in
 the Market Place.                     
 There are many things going on        
 there.                                
 Twice a year there is an Operatic     
 Society performance at Easter and     
 Christmas.Concerts of all kinds       
 are given by local schoolchildren and 
 orchestras.There are nights for       
 young people to learn to roller skate 
 and sometimes there is ice skating on 
 artificial ice.                       
 There are opportunities to buy at     
 craft fairs, charity bazaars and      
 antique fairs which are held on some  
 Saturdays and Sundays.It is also a    
 centre for people who wish to donate  
 blood.
