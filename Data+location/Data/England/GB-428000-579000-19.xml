		<title>19COMMUNITY EDUCATION IN BLYTH</title>
		<content>  The Wellesley Nautical School was    
 founded in 1868 to provide shelter for
 Tyneside waifs and provide trained    
 young men for service in the Royal and
 Merchant Navies.The first ship was the
 "Cornwall" soon replaced by the       
 battleship "Wellelsey."               
  At the turn of the century boys were 
 being taught seagoing trades and      
 public services. In March 1914 the    
 training ship was burnt. All boys and 
 staff were brought ashore safely.     
 Since then the school has been        
 shorebased at the old submarine base  
 at Blyth (except for a period during  
 the Second World War.)                
   Wellelsey became an Approved School 
 in 1933. It is now one of the two     
 Nautical Community Schools in Britain.
 The main courses are based on         
 seamanship.There are also other       
 courses to meet changing needs.       </content>
