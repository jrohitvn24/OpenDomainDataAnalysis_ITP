		<content>  As there are so many people living in
 all the houses in our area we wondered
 what there was for them to do in their
 spare time.                           
  We started off by asking the man in  
 charge of Parks in the Spelthorne     
 area.He told us that his department   
 looked after all the roads and greens 
 that make our roads look nice.He      
 organises all the flower beds and     
 shrubs to make parks pretty.The parks 
 provide lots of open spaces to play in
 with swings,slides and climbing       
 frames.They put fences round them so  
 that dogs are kept out to make it     
 cleaner for children to play in.      
  Nowadays the grass isn't cut so often
 and not so many new facilities are    
 built because of the lack of money.   
  The parks are always checked for     
 safety several times a year.
