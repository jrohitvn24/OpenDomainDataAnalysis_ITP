		<content> Here are some of the favourite boys   
 games at Lydbrook school.             
        {Headers and Volleys           
 This game is played with a football.  
 Each player has the same number of    
 points,except the  person who is in   
 goal who has one point more than the  
 rest.There are boundery lines and if  
 the football goes over the lines the  
 person who kicked it is in goal.Once  
 you get down to 0 points the game is  
 over.The last point has to be scored  
 by a header.                          
          {Hand Stands                 
 In Hand Stands someone is responsible 
 for calling " Ready steady go".       
 Everyone then does a handstand.The    
 person who stays up the longest is    
 then responsible for calling out"Ready
 steady go".This person is known as    
 being 'On it'.
