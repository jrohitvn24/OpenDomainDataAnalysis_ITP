		<content>The person who seems to do the most    
work in the home is the adult female.  
She does jobs like housework,washing,  
washing-up and ironing in a lot of     
cases,and sometimes she does the       
gardening and house maintenance as     
well,although more usually the adult   
male does these.Only rarely does he do 
the housework or washing-up and few men
that we asked did the washing or the   
ironing, but none of them were single. 
Children seem to have a fairly easy    
time.They do not do much to help.Only  
one boy did anything at all and he     
helped to do the washing- up.More      
girls  helped,one doing the            
housework,one doing the                
washing-up,another doing the  ironing  
and two helped by washing the family   
car.
