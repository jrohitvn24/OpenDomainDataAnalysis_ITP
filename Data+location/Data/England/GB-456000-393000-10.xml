		<content> We did a{survey}in the middle school, 
 the age range was 8_12 years.There are
 120 children included in this survey. 
 At the end these were the results:6   
 had Vic 20,7 had Commodore,19 had a   
 BBC and 19 had Spectrum.Altogether in 
 the middle school.44{computers}are    
 owned.38 owners use them for games,   
 27 for programming,8 for designing and
 8 for accounts.We are both looking    
 forward to the day when we can        
 program computers properly.We like    
 computers because we can play games   
 on them and program them.We think     
 that computers may control a whole    
 house one day and perhaps cars could  
 be driven by them.
