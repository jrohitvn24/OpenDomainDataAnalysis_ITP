		<title>12Living in Frimley Green</title>
		<content>   Situated close to the M3 motorway,  
{Frimley Green}is easily reached from  
 London, Heathrow and Gatwick Airports 
 and seaports like Southampton.        
   The volume of traffic through the   
 village is continually increasing so  
 that there is often congestion on the 
 roads which are narrow.               
   The one bus service in{Frimley Green
 runs every two hours, between         
 Aldershot and Camberley. The nearest  
 railway stations are Farnborough and  
 Frimley.                              
   There are quite a few small shops in
 the village, as well as a bank, post  
 office and building society, so all   
 basic needs are satisfied. People with
 cars tend to travel to nearby large   
 towns for shopping but the local      
 shopkeepers cater well for the elderly
 in particular.
