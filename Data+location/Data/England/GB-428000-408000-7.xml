		<content>   Most of the{shops}in our area       
 consist of small family businesses    
 where the shopkeeper lives on the     
 premises.We have many small,          
 independent bakers with shops that    
 still make traditional fayre and the  
 smell of hot bread wafts down the high
 street.We have only one self-service  
 shop,a mini supermarket,selling{food  
 ,several butchers' shops,a hardware   
 and D.I.Y. centre,and the usual       
 assortment of grocer and vegetable    
 merchants.                            
   The newest{business}to open is a    
 "Video" shop.This caters for the      
 latest craze in family{entertainment  
 of watching films on TV.A feature film
 can be hired for Â£1.25 per day.A      
 census of our class showed that over  
 half regularly watch hired films on   
 TV.
