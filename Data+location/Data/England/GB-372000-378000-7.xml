		<title>07THE KNUTSFORD GUARDIAN</title>
		<content>   The Knutsford Guardian is 125 years 
 old this year, 1985.  About 20,000    
 people read the Knutsford Guardian    
 each week. It has always been a very  
 popular local paper.                  
   The man who started the Guardian was
 called Dr.Alexander Mackie.  Today the
 Guardian has four journalists and one 
 photographer to cover the Knutsford   
 area. Altogether there are nine people
 who work for the Guardian.            
   The Guardian prints 6,500 papers a  
 week. It takes four working days and  
 one press day to print. The funniest  
 story they have ever printed is about 
 a girl taking her rabbit for a walk   
 every day because the vet said it was 
 too fat. The Guardian may be          
 introducing colour into the paper in  
 the future and the present editor, Mr.
 Wilson, would like to change to       
 tabloid size.                         </content>
