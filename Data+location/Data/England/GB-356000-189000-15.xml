		<title>15Problems of Transport</title>
		<content> If you live in Littleton your own form
 of transport is a virtual necessity.  
 No bus service runs through the       
 village although a mini-bus leaves the
 village at 10.00a.m. each Friday for a
 shopping excursion to nearby          
 Thornbury.                            
  The villagers of Aust are better     
 served  by public transport. Buses run
 from the Motoring Service Area to     
 Bristol at approximately two hourly   
 intervals. However,there are no buses 
 after about seven o'clock in the      
 evening. For those with cars getting  
 about the area is not difficult as    
 even the minor roads are quite good.
