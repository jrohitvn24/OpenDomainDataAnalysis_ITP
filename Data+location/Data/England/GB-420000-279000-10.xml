		<content>  {George Fentham Endowed Primary}     
{School}is for children from the age of
 4 to 11. We start each morning at 8.55
 a.m. and finish at 3.45 p.m. During   
 that time we do Mathematics, English, 
 General Studies and other work. Our   
 school is small but is equipped with a
 video, television, computer, disc     
 drives, printer, projector, camera and
 tape recorders. A warbler, which is   
 very loud, signals the end of lesson  
 times. Outside, next to the netball   
 court, there are garden plots,        
 climbing frames and a pond. We have   
 several school pets, including a      
 gerbil, guinea-pigs and stick insects.
 We can have school dinners or bring   
 sandwiches. There are 6{classrooms,}a 
 hall, kitchen, staffroom, medical     
 room, library and 2 offices. There are
 6{teachers,}a headteacher and a       
 secretary. We really do quite well.   </content>
