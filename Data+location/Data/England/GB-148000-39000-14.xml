		<content>{ Rugby}has always been the team sport 
 in St.Ives. There is now a fine       
 clubhouse and two good pitches, one   
 with floodlights. Recently{football   
 has begun to take off in St.Ives,     
 though at present the town's soccer   
 team has no pitch of its own and has  
 applied to use a rugby club pitch.    
{ Cricket}has restarted within the last
 four years. A town team uses the      
 comprehensive school grounds. The town
 has{squash, judo, bowling, table and  
{lawn tennis}and{sailing clubs.}There  
 is also a health studio and several   
 hotels with swimming pools. A{golf    
 course has recently been opened in the
 grounds of Tregenna Castle Hotel.     
  St.Ives is one of the birth places of
 British{surfing}and Porthmeor beach   
 attracts surfers (and wind surfers)   
 all year round.
