   Our survey area is centred oaround  
 the villge of Cold Norton. Now, we    
 know for a fact that this is a very   
 old village for we have evidence that 
 the village was mentioned in the      
 original Domesday Book of 1086.       
 However, most of the present village  
 has been built in the last twenty     
 years and the great majority of       
 families now living here have only    
 moved in recently. Many of the people 
 living in or around the village  work 
 away from the village, often in London
 or places a little nearer such as     
 Basildon.                             
   The area around the village is      
 largely rural, being used for the     
 farming of crops. Few animals are kept
 on farms in the area.
