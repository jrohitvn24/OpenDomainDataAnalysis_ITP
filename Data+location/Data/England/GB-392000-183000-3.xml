{The village church}is just off the    
 main road and is always locked except 
 on Sundays.This is because of possible
 vandals and robbers.We had to get the 
 key, which is huge and ancient,from   
{Mrs Dolman}who lives opposite.The     
 Church is quite small and does not    
 even have it's own vicar.There is one 
 service every Sunday,but this is taken
 by the vicar of Great Somerford,Rev.  
 Guy Oswald.We looked up in his book   
 how many people went to services.The  
 average for an ordinary Sunday was    
 about 15,but there were{26 at Easter, 
{36 on Christmas Eve}and{68 at the     
{carol service.}The church looks very  
 well cared for,with some lovely       
 flowers by the pulpit.
