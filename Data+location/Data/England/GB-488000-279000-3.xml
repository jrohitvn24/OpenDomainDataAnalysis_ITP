   Boughton House is surrounded by     
beautiful parkland with mature trees   
in abundance,much birdlife and         
domestic animals notably sheep.        
                                       
  It is said that before 1749 the 2nd. 
Duke of Montagu, John Â£the Planter',   
wanted to line the route from Boughton 
to London with trees.   Of course this 
was not allowed so he planted avenues  
of elms and some limes, about 75 miles 
of them, on his own land.   Dutch Elm  
Disease during the 1970's killed all   
the elms but these have been replaced  
with limes to preserve the style of    
the landscape.                         
                                       
 Lawns lead from the house down to an  
ornamental lake, well stocked with     
fish, which has been created in the    
course of the River Ise.               </content>
