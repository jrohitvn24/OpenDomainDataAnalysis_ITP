		<content> The majority of those with employment 
 travel beyond our area to their place 
 of work. Although certain firms draw  
 substancial numbers of workers from   
 our area, there is a wide range of    
 workplaces and job types. Thorntons   
 and Glow_Worm, for instance, draw in  
 many workers to Belper, yet the town  
 provides work for only about an eigth 
 of the areas workforce. The diversity 
 of work_types contrasts with the      
 dominance of the coal_extracting in   
 earlier generations. Unemployment is a
 major social concern, although the    
 areas  rate is close to the national  
 average. All that remains now is the  
 coal washing plant bedide the A.61 and
 the old spoil heaps which are         
 gradually being reclaimed for farming.
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
