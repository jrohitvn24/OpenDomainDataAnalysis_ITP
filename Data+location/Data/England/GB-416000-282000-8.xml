		<content> THE MAGLEV SYSTEM COST 4 MILLION      
 POUNDS AND TOOK ONE YEAR TO BUILD. THE
 MAXIMUM WAITING TIME BETWEEN CARS  IS 
 ONLY 2mins.                           
 THE TRAVELLER,USING MAGLEV AND        
 INTER-CITY RAILWAY SERVICES,CAN BE IN 
 BIRMINGHAM CITY CENTRE WITHIN 10mins  
 OF LEAVING THE AIRPORT.               
 THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO NOISE,NO MOVING 
 PARTS TO WEAR-OUT AND THERE IS NO NEED
 FOR TRACK MAINTENANCE.EACH CAR WORKS  
 AN 20 HOUR DAY,AND A LONG-TERM AIM IS 
 TO CARRY 3,200 PASSENGERS EVERY HOUR. 
 THE MAGLEV METHOD OF TRANSPORT IS THE 
 ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND IN THE COUNTRY.  
 RIDING ON MAGLEV, IT FELT LIKE THE    
 CARRIAGE WAS FLOATING AS IT LIFTED UP.
 THE RIDE WAS SMOOTH AND FAST.THE      
 CARRIAGE SLOWED DOWN TO GO ROUND THE  
 BEND.WE LIKED THE RIDE.
