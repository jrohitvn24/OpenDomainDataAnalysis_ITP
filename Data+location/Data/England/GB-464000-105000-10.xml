		<title>10Fort Widley</title>
		<content>  Fort Widley is one of the many forts 
 built by Lord Palmerston on Portsdown 
 Hill. It was built in Fareham red     
 brick by Irish Navvies and finished in
 1860. Its purpose was to defend       
 Portsmouth from attack behind         
 Portsdown Hill. From the back of      
 Portsdown Hill the fort is cleverly   
 disguised and looks like a grass      
 mound. It is one of the highest points
 of Portsmouth and there is a radio    
 communication pylon there. In World   
 War II troups were stationed there.   
 The fort is now a museum and tours are
 made hourly.There are many underground
 tunnels, spiral staircases, steep     
 stairs and unfenced drops which make  
 the tour unsuitable for handicapped   
 people and children need to be        
 accompanied by an adult.
