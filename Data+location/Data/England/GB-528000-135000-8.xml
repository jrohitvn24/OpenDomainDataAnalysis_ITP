		<content> Three factors have shaped Three       
 Bridges, the river Mole, the          
 Railway,and Crawley new town. The name
 Three Bridges came from the three     
 bridges that crossedthe river between 
 Crawley and Worth.In 1795 Three       
 Bridges was forest,the trees were     
 felled for agriculture and to provide 
 charcoal for nearby iron furnaces. In 
 1840 this was still an agricultural   
 area but included a smithy,the Plough 
 Inn and a flour mill.1841 saw the     
 arrival of the railway and as a result
 the population inreased considerably. 
 By 1916 there were 20 shops and 3     
 public houses. In 1947 Three Bridges  
 became part of Crawley new town but   
 many of the old names managed to      
 survive in modern street names e.g.   
 Scallows, Hazelwick andPriors. Local  
 employment is nowindustrial and       
 commercial.                           </content>
