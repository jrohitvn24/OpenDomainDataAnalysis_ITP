		<title>15CELTIC PLACENAMES</title>
		<content> IN THIS AREA, AS IN MOST OF CORNWALL, 
 PLACENAMES REFLECT THE CELTIC ROOTS OF
 THE PEOPLE AND LANGUAGE. MANY CORNISH 
 PLACE-NAMES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND
 IN WALES AND BRITANNY. THIS IS        
 BECAUSE, UNTIL THE TWELFTH CENTURY,   
 THE CORNISH, BRETONS AND WELSH WERE   
 ONE PEOPLE WITH ONE LANGUAGE. ST.     
 TETHA HERSELF WAS A CELTIC SAINT. SOME
 EXAMPLES OF CELTIC PLACE-NAMES IN AND 
 AROUND ST. TEATH ARE: HENDRA, TREKEE, 
 SUFFENTON, TREWETHEN, FENTENGO        
 TREHANNICK, TREWENNEN, TREVEIGHAN,    
 TRELILL, PENGENNA, CARKEEN AND        
 TREROOSEL. MANY OF THESE PLACES ARE   
 ANCIENT FARMSTEADS MENTIONED IN       
 DOCUMENTS GOING BACK TO THE TWELFTH   
 CENTURY AND BEYOND. TREROOSEL AND     
 POLROAD MANORS ARE MENTIONED IN THE   
 DOMESDAY BOOK.
