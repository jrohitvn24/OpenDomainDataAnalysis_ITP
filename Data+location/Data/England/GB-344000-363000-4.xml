		<content>{It's Monday 28th April 1985}          
 My name is Hayley,I'm ten years old   
 and live in Christleton with my       
 brother James and Mum and Dad. My     
 clock-radio wakes me up at 7.45am. We 
 breakfast together on orange juice,   
 cornflakes, toast, tea and a vitamin  
 tablet. I attend Christleton Primary  
 School while James goes to the High   
 School. Dad works for IBM Computers   
 and has to travel around the North    
 West each day. Mum works part-time at 
 a local Steakhouse. I had a busy      
 morning in school before eating a     
 school lunch of meat,potatoes,cabbage,
 cake and a glass of water.At lunchtime
 I went to Country Dance Club and      
 during the afternoon followed the     
 History Trail an exciting TV history  
 serial.School ended at 4.00 after an  
 enjoyable Choir Practice.
