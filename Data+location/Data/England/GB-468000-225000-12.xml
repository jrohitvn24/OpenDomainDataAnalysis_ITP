		<title>12Transport in Steeple Claydon</title>
		<content> Transport is particularly important in
 Steeple Claydon because it is so      
{isolated.}A large proportion of the   
 population is elderly or very young   
 and,as the nearest general{hospital}is
 17 miles away,transport can be a real 
 problem.                              
 Consequently 72% of the population use
 a car while only 23% use{public       
{transport.}However when specifically  
 asked,70% said they would use public  
 transport if it were available.This is
 important in view of the cuts due to  
 be implemented in the public transport
 sector.                               
 There are daily workers' buses to     
 Aylesbury and Buckingham.A bus goes to
 Buckingham on Tuesdays and Saturdays. 
 One goes to Bicester daily.On Tuesdays
 there is a bus to Milton Keynes while 
 Tesco provides a free bus on Tuedays  
 to its Hypermarket in Aylesbury.      </content>
