		<content> Labour-saving devices are now common. 
 Refrigerators and washing machines are
 standard equipment in our homes, and  
 in this area, remote from shops, deep 
 freezers are plentiful, because most  
 families go to town to stock up once a
 week, and freeze local fruit and      
 vegetables when they are cheap.       
 Dishwashers are comparatively rare.   
 Microwave ovens are becoming popular, 
 especially with working families, for 
 their convenience and speed. Modern   
 technology contributes to home        
 entertainment too: besides the        
 television, now taken for granted,    
 videos provide valuable facilities in 
 an area where a trip to a cinema or   
 theatre involves a long journey.      
 Computers have appeared in several    
 homes but citizens' band radios remain
 the province of a very few innovators.
