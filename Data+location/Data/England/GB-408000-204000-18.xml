		<title>18TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN BIBURY</title>
		<content> Most weekdays there are over 200      
 vehicles an hour going along the      
 A433. Of these about 30 are lorries   
 and heavy vehicles. The road wasn't   
 built four such traffic as it has     
 many dangerous corners and suddenly   
 narrows through the village. The      
 old turnpike junctions are complicated
 as 5 roads meet at the Pike and 6     
 roads at Ready Token. The bridge and  
 corner by the Swan Hotel are          
 particularly hazardous because lorries
 and buses have to take up both sides  
 of the road to negotiate the bend. The
 main street and bridge are always busy
 during the summer with tourists.      
 In the afternoons and at weekend all  
 available parking spaces in the       
 village centre are full of cars and   
 pedestrians making the roads even     
 more dangerous for visitors and locals
 alike.                                </content>
