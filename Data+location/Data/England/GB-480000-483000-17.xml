		<content>{Police Force.}Divisional headquarters 
 at Scarborough has 250 officers. Six  
 men work at Pickering and there is one
 resident policeman in Thornton.The    
 police are called out on an average of
 6 calls a day.                        
{Crime.}The most common crime is theft 
 from unattended vehicles, but violence
 and vandalism is on the increase.     
{Murderer.}Three years ago local life  
 was disrupted while hundreds of       
 officers hunted for police-killer     
 Barry Prudham.He lived rough in Dalby 
 forest and evaded police for a week.  
 He eventually died in a shoot-out at  
 Malton tennis courts.
