		<title>10A TYPICAL MORNING AT HOME</title>
		<content> Up gets Mark aged 15 at 4.45 a.m. His 
 alarm has buzzed away until it        
 stopped.   Movement upstairs as his   
 brother gets clean clothes for the    
 milk round.   He pulls on old jeans,  
 T-shirt and pullover.   He grabs      
 trainers and takes a quick wash in the
 bathroom.   He goes downstairs, puts  
 on the fire, kettle and radio,then he 
 makes his coffee and smokes a         
 cigarette.   At 5.30 he leaves to go  
 to work.                              
 When the alarm clock goes again, it's 
 for my dad.   He leaves the house at  
 twenty minutes to seven.              
 At seven o-clock my mum goes down in  
 her nightie.  She calls out "Sharron" 
 and again.   Reluctantly I get up at  
 around 8.   By 8.30, brother Richard  
 has gone off with his friend and      
 brother Mark has come home to change. 
 I leave for school and mum locks up.  </content>
