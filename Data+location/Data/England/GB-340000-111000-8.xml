		<content> When we have finished playing at      
 lunchtime and it is time to go in,    
 my mum, Mr Davies or Mrs Sherwood (or 
 teachers) clap their hands and we all 
 line up at the door. We go inside. The
 infants go through the corridor to    
 their classroom and the juniors       
 usually go through the dining room to 
 their classroom. In our classroom we  
 go and sit in the library so that Mr  
 Davies can tell us what we are going  
 to do. After that we go and sit at our
 tables and we do our spellings, or    
 tables which is learning to do        
 numbers. Sometimes we do painting or  
 finishing off writing. We work till   
 about 2.55 and then Mr Davies reads us
 a story. After that we say our prayers
 ready to go home. Sometimes we do     
 after school clubs such as cricket or 
 gymnastics with Mr Davies.
