		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO WEST CAMBS.</title>
		<content>   The area is situated on the western 
 fringes of Cambridgeshire, within one 
 kilometre of the Bedfordshire boundary
 and less than three kilometres from   
 Northamptonshire.   The land, which is
 low-lying and gently-undulating, is   
 mainly used for arable farming.       
                                       
                                       
    Most of the hundred and fifty      
 inhabitants live in the village of    
 Stow Longa, but the area also includes
 the southern edge of Catworth, a small
 settlement near the disused Kimbolton 
 railway station, the hamlet of Little 
 Catworth and several outlying farms.  
                                       
    Two minor roads cross the area,    
 linking the A45 and A6O4, and giving  
 easy access to the A1, M1 and M11, as 
 well as to the East Coast.
