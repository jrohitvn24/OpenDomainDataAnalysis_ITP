		<title>02Sturgate Airport.</title>
		<content>  On the 27th June 1985 we went for a  
 visit to Sturgate Airport. It is only 
 a small airport so only 11 people     
 work there, 10 men and 1 woman.       
 The airport was  built in 1940 so it  
 is 45 years old. Before it was a      
 private airport  it was an American   
 airbase. The day before we went they  
 had a visit from British Petroleum.   
 Lots of companies charter the planes  
 to fly their workers around Britain   
 and Europe. We saw a sign writer. He  
 was painting a sign on a plane.The    
 land aound the airport is owned by    
 farmer Frank Hewitt and he uses       
 it to grow crops. The runway is 850   
 metres long and 46 metres wide. The   
 planes they had were a 6,8 and 10     
 seaters. The petrol they use is called
 Avgas it is 5 star. If a plane has a  
 tank full of Avgas it can fly to Nice 
 in France.                            </content>
