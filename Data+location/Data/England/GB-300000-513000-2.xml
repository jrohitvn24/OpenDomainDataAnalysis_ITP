		<content> FAIR SQUEEZED OUT MARKET TRADERS      
                                       
 Traders were not amused when          
 fairground machinery took up some of  
 their regular pitches at Cleator Moor 
 last Friday.They felt it was unfair   
 that they could not set up their      
 stalls in their usual place opposite  
 the co-operative store.A spokesman for
 Copeland Council,however said that    
 they had a five year agreement with   
 the fair operators that they could    
 set up there for 2 weekends a year.   
 Only 4 traders were left on the square
 after another 4 had decided they would
 not set up on another part of the     
 site.One of them had come from Millom.
 Les Keenan,who operates a sweet stall 
 on the local market.Some decided to   
 staybut said that other traders as    
 well as customers were angered by the 
 inconvenience. by David Mingins       </content>
