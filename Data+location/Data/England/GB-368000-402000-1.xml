		<content> 4  1   Squares 1 &amp; 2 contain Salford's
        overspill council estate built 
 3  2   after World War II to help     
        solve a chronic housing        
 shortage caused by slums, overcrowding
 and bomb damage.  A new community has 
 been created in what was a small rural
 mining village.   Now there are       
 schools, churches, half empty         
 industrial estates, parks, cricket    
 clubs, a golf course and thousands of 
 residents.                            
        Square 3 contains part of      
 Cutacre Clough, once Europe's largest 
 coal slag heap, disused coal shafts,  
 grazing and waste land.  there are    
 only a handful of residents.          
        Square 4 is overshadowed by    
 Cutacre Clough slag heap towering over
 the surrounding dairy farm land. There
 is a large chemical works and an open 
 cast mine but few  inhabitants.       </content>
