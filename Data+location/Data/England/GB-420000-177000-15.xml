		<content> The fields, banks and hedgerows       
 support many forms of wildlife.       
 Rabbits are becoming more common in   
 the countryside once again having     
 survived their "near extermination" by
 myxomatosis in recent years. The      
 entrance holes to the warrens can     
 be clearly seen in the banks          
 bordering the farm tracks and lanes.  
 Fortunately they have not yet         
 multiplied enough to become a nuisance
 to farmers again.                     
 Badgers can also be seen in the area  
 and their setts are at present left   
 alone by those who feel that they can 
 spread disease.                       
 Foxes are fairly prevalent but are not
 hunted across this land.              
 Many wild birds nest here and the song
 of the skylark can be heard way above 
 on summer days                        
                                       </content>
