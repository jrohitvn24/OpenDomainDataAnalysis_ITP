		<title>15La Cotte de St Brelade</title>
		<content>  In the cliffs at Ouaisne, St.        
 Brelades there is a cave. It does not 
 look much like a cave today as the    
 rock making up the roof has fallen.   
 The cave is of great archaeological   
 importance. Various excavations have  
 revealed evidence of the cave's       
 occupation at different times by      
 Neanderthal man and by some species of
 now extinct animals, e.g. Woolly      
 Mammoth and Woolly Rhinoceros. The    
 latest dig was carried out between    
 1961 and 1980 by a team from Cambridge
 University led by Charles McBurney.   
 They have since blocked off the site, 
 intending it to be re-opened in later 
 years when certain investigative      
 techniques have been improved over    
 today's standards. Prince Charles was 
 one of the diggers on the site in     
 1968.
