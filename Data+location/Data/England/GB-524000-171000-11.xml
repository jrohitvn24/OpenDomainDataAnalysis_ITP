		<title>11Crime in the Doomsday Area</title>
		<content>As in other parts of London there is a 
great deal of crime in Wimbledon. For  
example there was the incident of a    
middle aged lady being raped in her own
car. The woman, aged 37,was followed   
along Plough Lane and grabbed from     
behind and then pushed into the back   
seat of her car.Other incidents include
bag snatchers who struck on a motorbike
in Hampton Close and grabbed a woman's 
bag.In Garfield Road there was a fire  
which children playing with matches are
said to have started.Street lights were
smashed in Plough Lane by vandals who  
caused 600 pounds worth of damage.     
This may also have been the work of    
children.
