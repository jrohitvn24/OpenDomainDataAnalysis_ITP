		<content> The area is towards the southern edge 
 of the dip slope of the Berkshire     
 Downs. To the north is a low chalk    
 plateau in intensive cereal production
 without hedges as previously sheep    
 grazing.To the south is a series of   
 north_south spurs and valleys of      
 low relief;the spurs capped by        
 infertile Reading Beds and Plateau    
 Gravels are wooded and managed for    
 shooting rather than timber.The       
 underlying London Clay with springs   
 and heavy soils provides grazing for  
 cattle and horses.The chalk valleys   
 are in cereal production or vegetables
 for a farm shop (479727).Most of the  
 land is owned by three families using 
 modern methods and employing little   
 labour. Planning control has retained 
 the rural nature of the area only     
 allowing new buildings in             
 Winterbourne.                         </content>
