		<title>09RISEBRIDGE FARM</title>
		<content>   At Risebridge Farm they have turned 
a hop farm into holiday cottages. They 
started by getting planning permission 
and then they went from there. Before  
the holiday cottages were made they    
were used for keeping cattle in. There 
are nine cottages altogether. Each     
cottage has the same furniture as most 
of us would have at our own houses.    
   From the few animals they have like 
cows and goats they get milk and make  
butter, youghurt and cheese, and you   
can buy all of theese in their little  
shop. Including all the holiday        
cottages and the spare land they use   
for cattle, there are 115 acres. There 
are lots of things to do. Here are     
some: Tennis, Swimming and Squash.     
They also have a Sauna bath and        
Jacuzzi. They grow Gooseberries,       
raspberries, potatoes and more to sell 
to their guests.                       </content>
