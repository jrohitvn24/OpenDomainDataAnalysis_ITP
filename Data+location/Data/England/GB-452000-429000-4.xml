		<title>04GASCOIGNE WOOD COAL MINE 3.</title>
		<content> The two tunnels are called the North  
 Drift and the South Drift each are 1.1
 kilometre at their deepest points.A   
 conveyor belt runs down each of them  
 at a speed of 20mph.They are 30kms    
 (18miles)long.The tunnels are lit by  
 flourescent lighting unless they are  
 in a new tunnel or at a coal face then
 they use their helmet lamps.They have 
 more than enough office staff but in  
 the future they hope to have only 20  
 because computers will do most of the 
 work even loading the trains.Accidents
 are very scarce underground because   
 miners are rarely on their own and    
 what's more their are telephones      
 connected to the offices every        
 100metres.When the miners' strike of  
 1984  was on work stopped completely  
 ,but in October 1984 miners began     
 drifting back and work began once     
 more.                                 </content>
