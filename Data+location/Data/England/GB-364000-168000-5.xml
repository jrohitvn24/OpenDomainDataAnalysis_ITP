		<title>05Keynsham High Street.</title>
		<content>   Keynsham is a very busy and crowded 
 town but in some places it is quite   
 peaceful. The busiest streets are the 
 High Street and Temple Street.They    
 join together to make one long shopp- 
 ing centre. The High Street is still  
 very busy even though the by-pass was 
 built. All day long cars,lorries and  
 motor-bikes go by. Lots of people use 
 the High Street because there are lots
 of different shops to go to, but you  
 cannot get around quickly because     
 there are so many people. The Town    
 Hall is like a tower. You can see for 
 miles. On the patio outside you can   
 sometimes see paintings by artists.   
 Next door to the Town Hall is the     
 library. The Fire Station is by the   
 Leisure Centre on Temple Street. Gate-
 way Supermarket has had two fires this
 year. They caused a lot of damage. The
 second time they caught a teenager.   </content>
