 When the breed bitch dog has babies   
 the guide dog owners wait until the   
 pups are six weeks old then they are  
 fostered into suitable homes. Here    
 they learn to cope with town life. The
 people who foster the pups take them  
 to different places, railway stations,
 shops etc. They are fostered for one  
 year. Next the pups spend one month   
 with their future owner.Then the pups 
 are trained. They then have an        
 obedience test.Trainers tell the dog  
 to sit, stand and heel. Between 5+8   
 months training the dog meets it's    
 future owner. When a breed bitch has a
 litter of pups the pups names all     
 begin with the same letter.           
   It costs Â£1000 to train one guide   
 dog. All the money is donated by      
 charities or by the collection of     
 silver foil.                          </content>
