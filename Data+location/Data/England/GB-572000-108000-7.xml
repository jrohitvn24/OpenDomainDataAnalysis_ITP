		<title>07TOURISTS: FOREIGN STUDENTS</title>
		<content>   {Many families}within our block{take
{in foreign students during the summer 
 months who come here to improve their 
 English.                              
    Most families receive them from    
{France and Germany}but some come from 
 as far away as{Japan.}The usual number
 per family is one or two, but some    
 take five at a time. The amount of    
 money per student varies between{Â£30  
{and Â£40 per week.                     
    Most families considered it was    
 worthwhile having them. They liked the
{extra money,}which was mainly used for
{holidays and home improvements.}They  
 also welcomed the chance to learn     
 about another country and perhaps     
 build up contacts there. Very few     
 families had problems, but the        
 responsibilitiy was a worry, and      
 language was another problem. The     
 majority would continue to have them. </content>
