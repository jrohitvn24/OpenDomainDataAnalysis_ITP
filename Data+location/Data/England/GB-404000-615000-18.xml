		<title>18Gravel Works, Powburn</title>
		<content> There are two gravel works in our     
 block of land. We went to visit one of
 them at Low Hedgeley.The gravel is    
 quarried up the valley of the River   
 Breamish at Roddam. It is brought down
 to Low Hedgeley by lorry and processed
 there.                                
                                       
 The gravel is called 'ballast' before 
 it has been processed. This is when it
 is mixed with coarse sand and other   
 materials. First it is put in the     
 'feed box'. It is screened and graded 
 for different sizes of gravel.        
                                       
 At Low Hedgeley there are five workers
 on the site and five drivers. Sand and
 gravel are supplied to the building   
 trade. When we were there, loads were 
 going off to Newcastle to build a new 
 football stand at St James's Park.
