		<title>03HACEBY-A VANISHED VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> According to 1563 records this place  
 had 40 families but in 1985 only 4    
 people live there:a gamekeeper and a  
 farmworker with their wives.Until 1892
 whentheparish was joined tothat of    
 Newton,Haceby had its own Rector and  
 its population was 73.The whole       
 village is estate-owned and has been  
 encouraged to decline as houses have  
 been demolished as soon as tenancies  
 expired.Today there are 3 houses,1    
 fully-modernised farmyard with grain  
 drier,silos and store-sheds and the   
 old church,now in the care ofthe      
 Historic Churches Trust.This church,  
 with its interior much as it must have
 been in 1563,has only i service each  
 year.The surrounding fields yield     
 Roman and later artefacts.
