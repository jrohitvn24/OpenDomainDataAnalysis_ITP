		<title>07THE EXMOOR FLOODS</title>
		<content>     Between 11.30 am. on August 15th. 
 1952 and 9.30 am. on August 16th, nine
 inches of rain was recorded on the    
 Chains.It has been estimated that this
 amounted to over three billon gallons 
 of water. Every combe running off the 
 Chains was awash, the narrow high     
 sided combes caused the water to      
 create tidal waves. The River Barle   
 brought floods to Simonsbath and      
 Withypool, the River Exe caused       
 flooding in Exford and Dulverton, but 
 the greatest disaster was caused by   
 the beautiful Lyn rivers, East and    
 West. They carried tons of water,     
 boulders and trees onto the village of
 Lynmouth. They caused two million     
 pounds worth of damage and the deaths 
 of thirty people.
