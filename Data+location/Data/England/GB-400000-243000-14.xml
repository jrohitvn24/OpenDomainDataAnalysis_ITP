		<title>14Hampton Foot Ferry, Evesham.</title>
		<content>    Some{monks}lived in Evesham Abbey  
 about 9OO years ago. On the other side
 of the river was their{vineyard}on    
 Clarke's Hill. They needed to get     
 across so they made a{ferry.}They     
 stored their wine in the{cellars of   
{the Ferry House.}Nowadays the ferry   
{opens 8.a.m. till dusk.}On a busy day 
 they have 4OO-5OO{passengers},normally
 they would have l5O. Mr. Huxley taught
 the Children of Hampton to swim. His  
 daughter,{Mrs. Raphael, now owns the  
{Ferry.}One night a car came down Boat 
 Lane. The driver thought the river was
 a ford so he carried on and the car   
 sank into the river. The driver       
 escaped. Each{boat}lasts about 3O     
 years; they get across by pulling a   
{rope.}If another boat comes to the    
 ferry it sounds it's horn and the     
 ferry rope is lowered under the water.
