		<content> FLEET POND NATURE RESERVE             
 Fleet pond is the largest{freshwater  
{lake}in Hampshire and is surrounded by
 a{nature reserve}of 133 acres to which
 the public are allowed access. Walking
 round the pond takes one and a half   
 hours, going through pine, oak and    
 birch woods. Some areas are boggy and 
 walkers are advised to keep to the    
 paths. The animal life is varied and  
 in the heathland there are many       
 butterflies. Amongst the{wild flowers}
 are wild iris, primrose, ragged robin 
 and water-lilies.  There are also many
 different insects living in the       
 heather and gorse. There are fish in  
 the pond to be caught by licensed     
 fishermen. The pond is a favourite    
{beauty spot}for both the young and old
 of Fleet. Since 1973 it has been owned
 by Hart District Council.
