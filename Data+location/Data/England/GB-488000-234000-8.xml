		<title>08DRUG ABUSE</title>
		<content> The biggest problem at the moment is  
 drug abuse. There are about one       
 million drug addicts in London        
 alone.The most used drugs are heroine 
 and cocaine. Some people have died    
 after taking too much of these drugs. 
 So now lots of people are trying to   
 track down the dealers and hoping to  
 ask them questions to find even more  
 drug dealers. Also there have been    
 programmes on the drug problem such   
 as: Save the Scag Kids; Panorama and  
 special documentaries at night about  
 drugs.                                
  Some people have tried very peculiar 
 ways of getting drugs past customs'   
 officials such as moulding the drug   
 into a model or the most dangerous _  
 swallowing it in a special, knotted   
 bag.                                  
  Another sort of drug, popular two or 
 three years ago is glue-sniffing.     </content>
