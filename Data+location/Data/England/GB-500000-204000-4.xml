		<content> "You are late for breakfast again     
 Stephen,"screamed Mum.It was half past
 eight!When I got down stairs I ran in 
 to the kitchen.I jumped on to my      
 chair.Soon I was slurping up my       
 branflakes and  was making a terrible 
 noise.My mum came in."You'd better go 
 to school now,"she said.I ran off to  
 get my school bag.I opened the door   
 and ran off to school.When I got there
 our teacher was calling the register I
 dashed in,took off my coat and sat    
 down.Next we did some Maths.After     
 an hour it  was playtime .I played    
 marbles. We did some English for an   
 hour,then it was 12.00 and lunch time.
 In the afternoon we did some art and  
 craft for one hour. We had another    
 playtime and we went for music,then we
 had a story and went home.I watched   
 television until dinner at 6.00,then I
 read a book and went to bed at 8.30.  </content>
