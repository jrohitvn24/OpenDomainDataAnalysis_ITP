     In Butterton, the village primary 
school was closed in 1979 but the      
building has now become the village    
hall.  A Bingo session is now held     
there every other Monday evening and a 
doctor's surgery is held there every   
day.  During the annual Butterton Gala 
the village hall is used for fund      
raising activities and the disco.      
     Another building that has been    
closed is the chapel.  It is now a     
carpenter's workshop but the owner     
wants to change it into a holiday      
cottage.                               
     In Onecote, the primary school was
closed in 1984 and the villagers would 
now like to turn it into a village     
hall.                                  
     The Post Office in Onecote has    
also recently been closed due to the   
ill health of the former Post mistress.</content>
