		<title>11BERKELEY POWER STATION (3)</title>
		<content> Perhaps due to the constant watchful  
 eye of{conservation}movements Berkeley
 Power Station moniters various local  
 levels of{radiation}on for example the
 soil, water (esp. River Severn) and   
 air. Two people are employed for this 
 work, they visit local farms, streams,
 etc. and process their samples at     
 laboratories based in nearby Stone.   
 The conservation movements too, carry 
 out periodic{inspections}to check the 
 station's data. The CEGB's main       
 nuclear research labs are also at     
 Berkeley and are likely to{outlive}the
 power station. To add to the{conflict,
 the power station and the labs provide
 most of the local work so making the  
 issue of{jobs vs dangers of nuclear   
{power}a difficult one to solve        
 locally. Open Days and guided tours   
 are used to try to promote the station
 as being part of a{'safe'}industry.   </content>
