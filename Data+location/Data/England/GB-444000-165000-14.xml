		<title>14NORTHCROFT RECREATION CENTRE</title>
		<content> This building was built in 1980 and   
 opened by olympic gold medalist, David
 Wilkie on 13th september. The staff   
 consists of 4 managers, 7 lifeguards, 
 5 receptionists, 2 cleaners and 10    
 partime lifeguards. The activities at 
 the moment are swimming, squash, table
 tennis, multi-gym, gymnastics, yoga,  
 fencing and self defence. On the side 
 there is being built an extension     
 which will house a bar, separate      
 changing rooms for dry sports and     
 swimming and a new multi-gym. At the  
 moment the average number of people   
 using the swimming pools on a busy day
 is about 2,000. The centre is only    
 closed 3 times a year at Christmas,   
 Boxing Day and New Year's Day. Since  
 the centre was built thousands of     
 people have used it and in all the    
 recreation centre has been a great    
 asset to the people of Newbury.       </content>
