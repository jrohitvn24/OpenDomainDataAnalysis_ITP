		<content> This is the{Lower Cretaceous}surface  
 of alternating beds of varied clays   
 and sandstones with gentle, mainly    
 westward dipping and occasional west  
 to east faulting. There are several   
 steepsided valleys in which are       
 numerous outcrops of the massive      
 sandstone which forms the upper part  
 of the{Lower Tunbridge Wells Sand}in  
 the western{Weald.}The most imposing  
 examples are in the privately owned   
{Chiddinglye Wood,}where well-jointed  
 sandstone is slightly cambered so that
 large rectangular blocks have become  
 separated from the main outcrop by    
 narrow vertical chasms up to 11m deep.
 Some of the rocks also show under     
 cutting at their base caused by water 
 seepage. A striking example of this is
 the rock called{Great Upon Little,    
 where a great mass of sandstone over  
 hangs a thin central support.         </content>
