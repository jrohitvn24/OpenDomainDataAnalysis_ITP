		<title>17A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content>  My name is Carl and I live in        
 Wicklewood which is near Wymondham ,in
 N orfolk.I live with my Mum, Dad and  
 sister. I rise at 7.30 and at 8.25 I  
 leave for school. Sometimes I cycle   
 and at other times I walk.When I get  
 to school I play Bulldog. One person  
 has to stand in the middle of the     
 playground and try to touch the others
 who run across. At 9.00 we go into    
 school for registration and assembly. 
 Then we work for an hour at           
 mathematics or English. At 10.30 we go
 out to play for 15 minutes. We work   
 until noon doing topic work, health   
 education and so on. Then we have our 
 lunch and are free until 13.15. We may
 have art, games or drama or one of the
 subjects from the morning's list. We  
 have another break at 14.30 for 15    
 minutes and school ends at 15.30.
