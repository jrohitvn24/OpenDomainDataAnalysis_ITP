		<content> Westhay built the heavy, wooden track 
 to link the two areas. The track was  
{2500 metres long.}It is made of wood. 
 Alder planks or split logs were laid  
 side by side with smaller branches    
 placed in the gaps to form a heavy    
 solid trackway. By the side of the    
 road thin, long pegs were hammered    
 into the marsh to hold the track in   
 place.  The pegs may also have helped 
 the men to find the track when the    
 area was flooded.                     
   Over 30,000 alder planks of about   
 one metre long were used in the track 
 as well as 15,000 pegs.               
   The track was used for a few years  
 but it was gradually covered over by  
 the vegetation of the bog. It is now  
 buried under several metres of earth.
