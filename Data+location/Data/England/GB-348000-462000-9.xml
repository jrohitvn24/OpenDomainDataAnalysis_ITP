		<title>09CATON ROAD DEVELOPMENT I</title>
		<content>Caton Road is the main going east out  
of Lancaster.Also going in the same    
direction is the remains of a railway  
line which ran on the land between the 
road and the river.The railway line was
begun in 1847 and ran from Green Ayr   
Station,(opposite the Kingsway Baths   
nowadays),to Yorkshire.It was closed   
in 1965 when Dr Beeching cut down the  
railway routes.Nowadays the route is   
being made into a footpath and cycle   
track from Lancaster to Caton passing  
through beautiful scenery of woods     
and fields.Yet when he leaves Lancaster
the traveller only sees the back of    
factorys and derilict sites and has to 
walk about a mile before he sees John  
Rennie's beautiful aqueduct (built 1797
) carrying the Lancaster Canal over the
river.The cycle path ends after four   
miles,on the far side of Caton.
