 old Hunting Lodge and Racing Stable   
 was adapted in 1924 to a

    The elegant house and outbuildings 
 stand in an area of 40 hectares.      
 Pleasant gardens surround the Centre  
 and the outlying area contains conifer
 trees and deciduous woodland.A pond of

 private{fishing}and as an emergency   
 supply of water in the event of fire. 
 An area of grazing ground is let to a 
 neighbouring farmer.The area contains 
 a slurry pit and private sewage works.

 by a 'Grey Lady', and lute music has  
 been heard by staff in the main hall. </content>
