		<content> Historical Buildings                  
 There are three main historical       
 buildings in Alford. The{five sailed  
{mill}was built in the late eighteenth 
 century by{Mr Sam Oxley.}It is 95ft   
 tall and has 6 floors. It is capable  
 of grinding between 4 and 5 tons a    
 day.                                  
{St Wilfrids church}stands on the site 
 of an earlier Norman church which was 
 pulled down to make room for the      
 present built by{Sir William of       
{Tothby.}There is a large south porch  
 with a room above which was almost    
 certainly the home of the Grammar     
 school in the 16th century.           
 The{Manor house}was built in 1540 by  
 some unknown person. It was then      
 restored by{John Scholey}and is now   
 owned by Alford and District Civic    
 Trust.
