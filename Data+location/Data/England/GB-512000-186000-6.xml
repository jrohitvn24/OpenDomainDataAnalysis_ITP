 I USUALLY SPEND SUNDAY MORNINGS       
 BATHING AND DRYING MY HAIR.THEN I GO  
 DOWN AND HELP MY MUM IN THE KITCHEN.  
 IN THE AFTERNOON I GET READY TO GO TO 
 THE TEMPLE.WE GO THERE EVERY SUNDAY   
 AND SOMETIMES ON A WEEKDAY IF THERE IS
 A SPECIAL OCCASION.AT THE TEMPLE WE   
 FIRST LISTEN TO SOMEONE WHO READS OUR 
 BIBLE AND THEN PRAY.THEN AT 6.30      
 WE DO A THING CALLED AN ARTI WHEN WE  
 PRAY AND PUT SOME FOOD BY OUR GOD'S   
 PHOTO SO THAT HE CAN EAT. FOR THE LAST
 TWO WEEKS I HAVE BEEN GOING TO THE    
 TEMPLE AT 3.00 TO LEARN INDIAN        
 DANCING. THE TEMPLE FINISHES AT 8.30  
 WHICH IS WHEN WE COME HOME TO HAVE    
 SOMETHING TO EAT. THEN I WATCH T.V.   
 FOR A WHILE. AT ABOUT 9.45 I GO       
 UPSTAIRS,CLEAN MY TEETH AND AM IN BED 
 BY 10.00PM.                           
                                       </content>
