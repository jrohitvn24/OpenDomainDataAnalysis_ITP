		<title>15BIG BUSINESS IN STIBBINGTON</title>
		<content>  This local business was started in   
 1935 with three people, now extended  
 to 50.  In 1960 they started making   
 different kinds of machinery.         
  They make their own trucks, and as   
 well as selling them they hire them   
 out to people.                        
  To hire a truck it varies between Â£13
 and Â£30 per hour.                     
  The trucks they make are mainly      
 farming trucks, some of which are tip-
 ups. Altogether they make 7 types of  
 machines and boats.                   
  All of the English trucks are        
 electric vehicles; the rest which come
 from Japan, need petrol to work.      
  The machinery is kept just past the  
 railway station, the other half is    
 kept near Thornhaugh.                 
  The company takes part in shows, like
 the East of England Show, which helps 
 to advertise and sell their machines. </content>
