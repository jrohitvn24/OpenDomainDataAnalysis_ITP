		<content> When you leave Alnwick to the north   
 and west you find higher land.   It is
 mainly moorland with typical farming  
 for the area.  The area also contains 
 Hulne Park, which is part of the Percy
 Estate, which is devoted to forestry  
 and farming.  To the north and east   
 are the Pastures, which are overlooked
 by the Castle, which was supposed to  
 have been treescaped by Capability    
 Brown.  Further afield there is       
 general mixed farming with no shortage
 of scattered farmsteads, the          
 occasional hamlet and small village.  
 This part of north Northumberland is  
 extremely picturesque and prosperous  
 looking.  It has been described by    
 John Wesley as, "Certainly if I didn't
 believe there was another world, I    
 would spend all my summers here as I  
 know no place in Great Britain        
 comparable to it for pleasantness".   </content>
