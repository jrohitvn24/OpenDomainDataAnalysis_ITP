		<content>   Throughout its history, until the   
 present day, Dartmoor has been mined  
 for tin. In fact tin streaming        
 leading to the silting of the{River   
{Plym}was the cause of the decline of  
 one of the{Stannary towns Plympton.   
  {Foxhole Mine}lies just to the East  
 of{Brat Tor,}and is well preserved    
 example of a Dartmoor mine.           
   The tinners hut to be found here is 
 a Hilton amoung tinners huts,         
 consisting as it does of two rooms. It
 is also in a good state of repair,    
 unlike most of the huts on the moor.  
 The wheel pit, and the buddles are    
 apparent, and a granite tramway can be
 discerned. The leat used to obtain the
 water for the mine can be seen as it  
 drains down towards Doe Tor Brook. The
 extensive workings are amazing,       
 considering they were all dug by hand.
