		<title>12Holy Cross Church Binstead</title>
		<content>   The church has about 200 members.   
 It is situated near the the sea, some 
 distance from the village. It was     
 originally built to serve the         
 community employed in the{limestone   
{quarries or "pitts"}as they were known
 locally.                              
   Very little of the original building
 remains. The Chancel wall has an      
 ancient scratch-dial and herringbone  
 stonework of the early{Norman}period. 
 The Nave dates from the 19th century. 
 Much of the church was restored after 
 a fire in 1969.                       
   The most interesting grave in the   
 churchyard is that of{Thomas Sivell   
 and is mistakenly known as the        
{"Smuggler's grave".}Sivell was not a  
 smuggler but was shot in error by     
 customs officers from Portsmouth on   
 15th June 1785. The head stone has a  
 sculptured scene of the incident.     </content>
