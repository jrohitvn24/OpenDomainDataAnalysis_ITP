		<title>19PAST AND PRESENT IN HORTON</title>
		<content>   The{Grickstone}is the oldest thing  
 in Horton. It marks the boundary. The 
 frost is starting to wear it away.    
 Iron Age people used to live on{Horton
{Camp.}Now it is used to graze cattle. 
 In 1844 a horse was ploughing and it  
 fell down a hole,which was the{Long   
{Barrow.}They found some pottery and   
 skeletons.In those days people were   
 not interested in History so they     
 filled the hole in.Horton was recorded
 in{Domesday Book,}which is so old that
 it is in a museum. The{Norman Hall}is 
 the oldest part of{Horton Court.}The  
 rest was built in the 16th Century.   
 Near by are the Norman{rabbit warrens 
 and{fish ponds.}The{old bridge}and    
{road}are in ruins now.People still    
 worship in{Horton Church. Bodkin Hazel
{Wood}has not got any of its old trees.
 It is used sometimes for motor bike   
 scrambling.               Katherine   </content>
