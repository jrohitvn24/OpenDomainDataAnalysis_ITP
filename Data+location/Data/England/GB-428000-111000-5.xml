		<title>05Headmaster at Bartley Middle</title>
		<content>{Mr King }has been Headmaster at {     
{Bartley Middle School}since the       
 changeover from Secondary to Middle   
 School in 1974. He was appointed to   
 organize the whole school from scratch
 and so the whole school is set out on 
 lines of his choosing. Mr King decided
 on a semi-open plan system with all   
 classes leading onto a central        
 corridor, no doors on any of the      
 classrooms. He has adopted the policy 
 of appointing specialist teachers.    
 They now have specialists in          
 Computers, Music, Science and Remedial
 Studies. He has never found it        
 necessary to expel any pupil and only 
 administers corporal punishment for   
 very serious crimes. The Headmaster   
 has no power to fire a member of      
 staff. He has the help of a full time 
 secretary for the administration of   
 the School                            </content>
