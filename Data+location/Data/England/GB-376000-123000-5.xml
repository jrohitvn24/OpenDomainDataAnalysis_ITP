		<content> Near the hamlets of Sandley and       
 Bugley,100 years ago flourished       
 Compton Stud.The silver medals it     
 awarded to breeders can still be seen.
 Later it was owned by Lord Furness.A  
 piece of stone statuary placed by him 
 in the centre of the main yard is     
 still in place.During the second world
 war the then National Stud was moved  
 to Sandley from Tully in the Republic 
 of Ireland.Under the Director Mr.Peter
 Burrell the stud was extended from 180
 to 400acres.The original boxes in the 
 main yard were of timber and in 1946  
 they were rebuilt in brick.The unusual
 weathervane depicting a stork carrying
 a foal was added above the main block 
 at this time.
