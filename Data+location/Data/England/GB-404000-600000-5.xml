		<content> The river Coquet flows through        
 Rothbury and it is very popular for   
 fishing. Large salmon and sea trout   
 are quite often caught, sometimes up  
 to twenty pounds in weight. You have  
 to buy a license to fish for them or  
 for brown trout. There is a shop in   
 the village which sells licenses once 
 you have decided which kind you want. 
 Some of the fishing rights are owned  
 by the local angling club and some by 
 the Northumberland Federation so you  
 need a book which clearly indicates   
 the parts you can fish.               
 Most people seem to use artificial fly
 but the biggest fish are caught either
 on worm or the spinner. There is a    
 deep pool at the old Thrum Mill just  
 outside Rothbury where most of the big
 fish are caught.
