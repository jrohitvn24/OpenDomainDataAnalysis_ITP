		<content>{THE VILLAGE POST OFFICE - WHITEGATE.  
 The Post Office building is quite a   
 modern one,replacing a wattle and daub
 building which is, at present, being  
 converted into a dwelling.The retail  
 outlet is incorporated with the Post  
 Office counter and a small snack-bar. 
   The present Postmistress has held   
 the position for nine months. She     
 points out that the Post Office       
 section attracts more business than   
 the shop. All the usual postal        
 services are on offer except car road 
 taxes which must be purchased at a    
 Crown Office. The nearest is in       
 Winsford.                             
   About 100 people per day use the    
 Post Office.The busiest day is        
 Thursday, pension day. Tuesday, family
 allowance day,is not as busy.         
 Few children live in the village.The  
 shop provides a village meeting place.</content>
