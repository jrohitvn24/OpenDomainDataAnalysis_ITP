		<content> At eleven o clock we come back in and 
 do some work.  At five to twelve we   
 play hang man and at twelve o clock we
 have dinner.  We have an hour for     
 dinner, then the bell goes and we go  
 in and have some story.  Then we might
 watch Music Time or do some singing or
 we go straight into work.  At three o 
 clock we go home.  Well, I walk home  
 and I get my playing clothes on and go
 and play with my friends. Tea is at   
 ten to five so we go in for tea.  When
 we have finished tea we go and call   
 for the little ones and then at half  
 seven we go in and watch telly and    
 then we go to bed.
