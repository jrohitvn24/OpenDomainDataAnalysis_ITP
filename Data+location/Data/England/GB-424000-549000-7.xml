		<title>07THE WORK OF THE POLICE</title>
		<content> German Shepherd dogs are bred and used
 by the Police force after 13 weeks    
 of training.The handler keeps his dog 
 at home.There are 6 dogs in the force 
 which were trained at Harperley Hall.4
 were trained to search for drugs and 2
 for explosives.They are taught a range
 of different attacks. The Police have 
 4 Rover 2600 patrol cars equipped with
 the latest technology.They are yellow 
 and white and each carries a          
 breathalizer and an emergency kit.The 
 officers' main role is to patrol the  
 major trunk routes and  be first at an
 accident.2 or 3 years ago (now 1985)  
 following a tragic road accident on   
 the Pelton by-pass there was a safety 
 campaign and now there is a safer     
 crossing,better lighting and a speed  
 restriction.
