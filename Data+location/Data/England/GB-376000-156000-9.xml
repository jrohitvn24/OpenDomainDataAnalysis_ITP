		<content>{ OLDFIELD NURSERY}IS SITED ON THE     
 A366, N.E. OF NORTON ST. PHILIP,      
 APPROXIMATELY 3 KM. FROM HINTON       
 CHARTERHOUSE. TWELVE PEOPLE ARE       
 EMPLOYED HERE, MANAGED BY THE OWNER, A
 QUALIFIED BOTANIST.                   
  THE HALF-ACRE SITE INCLUDES THE      
 OWNER'S HOUSE, 6 GREENHOUSES, EACH    
 FITTED WITH SPRAYING AND HEATING      
 FACILITIES, A POTTING SHED AND PARKING
 FOR 20 CARS. ALTHOUGH PARKING IS      
 LIMITED, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE 30   
 YEAR OLD BUSINESS WILL ATTRACT SOME   
 20,000 VISITORS DURING 1985.          
  THE FIRM SPECIALISES IN GROWING      
 PLANTS SUITABLE FOR LIMESTONE AREAS.  
 YOUNG PLANTS ARE REARED UNDER COVER,  
 WITH MORE MATURE ONES OUTSIDE. THE    
 GROWING TECHNIQUE INVOLVES SPECIAL    
 CRYSTALS, WHICH ABSORB WATER WHEN WET,
 AND RELEASE IT IN DRY CONDITIONS. THIS
 HELPS TO KEEP COSTS TO A MINIMUM.     </content>
