		<content>      On Saturday we have our breakfast
 and then we go to Hedon to visit my   
 Grandad and Grandma. When we get there
 my Grandad and I go to the sweet shop 
 in the market place. He gets the      
 Farmer's Weekly and the Grower. He    
 gets Pippin and Buttons for my brother
 and me. Next he gets the buns and     
 cakes from Skelton's (I call it       
 Skellitons). Then my Grandma and I    
 get the meat and eggs from the        
 butcher's.                            
      When I get home I watch          
 television till somewhere around 11   
 o'clock and then all of us go to      
 Granny's and we have fish and chips   
 from Sproatley Fish and Chip Shop.    
      Afterwards, my Dad and I go to   
 the butcher's to get our meat and     
 eggs. When we get home I play games   
 until tea-time and I draw and play    
 before bed-time.                      </content>
