		<title>03Steeple Claydon's Population</title>
		<content> The population of the area has grown  
 to 1600 at the{1981 Census}and changed
 over the years.A questionnaire was    
 distributed to every house in the     
 village.Only 30% of the householders  
 responded.The children have worked on 
 these and the following facts have    
 emerged:                              
 1. 4 out of 5 of the population were  
 not born in the village.              
 2. 60% of these have come to the      
 village in the last 10 years.         
 3. 40% of these arrived in the last 5 
 years.                                
 The search for{employment}has brought 
 families to Buckinghamshire and the   
 desire to live in a village has       
 brought them to Steeple Claydon.The   
 comparative{cheapness}of housing in   
 the area has helped the growth.A      
 3-bedroomed house would cost about    
 #30,000 in July 1985.                 </content>
