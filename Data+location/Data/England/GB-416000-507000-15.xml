		<title>15MELSONBY-The Village Green</title>
		<content>  Unlike    many    English   villages,
 Melsonby  has not had a  village green
 for  very  long.    At  the  beginning
 of this  century, much of the farmland
 and  properties to the  North  of  the
 cross-roads  formed  part of the {Duke
{of Northumberland's   Stanwick Estate.
 Some   10 years  after  the  death  of
 Eleanor, the  Dowager Duchess in 1911,
 these  estates  were  divided  up into
 lots  and{sold at an  auction }held in
{Darlington }on{6th Oct 1921.}  Part of
 the{land (0.35 acres) }which now forms
 the {Green }was {Lot 50} and  this was
{bought by}the {Ripon Diocesan Board of
{Finance}for{Â£20.}This{land was used}as
 the{playground}for the {C. of E. aided
{school }  and    also    included   a 
 Blacksmith's shop and other buildings.
 Following the{closure of the school}in
{1959, }the{ land }was {bought  by }the
{Parish Council}for{Â£1}&amp; made a Green. </content>
