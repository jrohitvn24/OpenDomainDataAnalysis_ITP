		<title>14GAMES CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content> QUEENIE EYE is a game played by three 
or more children. One child throws the 
ball over his shoulder to be caught by 
one of the others and hidden about     
their person. The thrower turns to the 
others and is asked,                   
"Queenie Eye,Queenie Eye, who's got the
ball?"  If a correct guess is not made 
by the thrower straight away the       
others are asked to come forward one   
by one to be questioned. Elaborate     
ploys  are used to deceive the         
thrower. If a correct guess is made    
then the child with the ball becomes   
the thrower and the game continues.    
                                       
STUCK-IN-MUD is played by younger      
pupils  and is like TIG. One child     
tries to catch others. If caught they  
are "stuck-in-mud" with outstretched   
arms. To be freed someone else has to  
run under their arms.                  </content>
