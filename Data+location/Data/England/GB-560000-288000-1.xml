		<title>01FLAT LAND OF THE LITTLE OUSE</title>
		<content> The two dozen homes that line the     
 banks of the Little Ouse are mostly   
 farm houses, the only access to these 
 being a poplar lined dirt track which 
 stretches the length of the village.  
 Little Ouse is surrounded by farmland 
 many of the fields are also lined by  
 tall poplar trees which stand as      
 windbreakers against the 'Fen Blows' -
 strong winds which rob the fields of  
 valuable top soil. Farming is the most
 common occupation here with the flat  
 land being used to grow sugar beet,   
 potatoes and cereal crops, thoses who 
 so not work on the land commute 10-30 
 miles to the nearest town or city. For
 the children in the village there is a
 one roomed primary school. However    
 this will close in 1986 and all the   
 children will travel to either the    
 primary school in Littleport of the   
 college in Ely 10 miles away.         </content>
