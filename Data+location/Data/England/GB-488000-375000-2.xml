		<content> The names Saxilby and Ingleby  are  of
 Danish  origin.  At  Saxilby,  a  Dane
 called  Saxulf  probably  settled   by
 marshy  land  near  the Fossdyke canal
 (Roman created) close to  an  existing
 Anglo-Saxon  settlement. Ingleby means
 settlement  of  the  English  and   is
 mentioned  in  the  original  Domesday
 Book. Broxholme is also mentioned  and
 means  holme or  island  by the brook,
 brook being the River  Till.  Evidence
 of  wide  and  deep  ridge  and furrow
 cultivation  can  still  be  seen   in
 grassland  at  Broxholme and there are
 boundary ditches of  some  crofts  and
 tofts  along  the medieval main street
 which fell into  decay  by  1840.  One
 17th  century cottage remains. Ingleby
 also has evidence in the grassland  of
 its  historic lost village and has now
 amalgamated with Saxilby to  form  one
 parish.                               </content>
