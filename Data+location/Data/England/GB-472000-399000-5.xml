   In Westwoodside on Nethergate there 
 is the Village Hall.                  
   Five days a week the{playgroup}meet 
 there. The children who go are two to 
 four years old. They meet from        
 9:15a.m. to ll:30 a.m..               
     There are several helpers and the 
 children have many things to play on  
 and in. For example table toys like   
 drawing and jig-saws, painting and    
 gluing pictures on pieces of          
 paper. There is a book corner and also
 a wendy house and sand and water to   
 play in. Half way through the session 
 they all have a drink of orange and a 
 biscuit, and there is sometimes a     
 meeting to see the parents. The       
 helpers like to meet new children who 
 come to{playgroup.
