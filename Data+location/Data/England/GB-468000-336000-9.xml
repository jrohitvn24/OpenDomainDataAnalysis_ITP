		<title>09HOUSING: BUTLER, TITHBY</title>
		<content> Housing is attractively varied and    
 development has mainly been limited to
 rebuilding and infilling. At{Cropwell{
{Butler}old cottages have been improved
 &amp; modernised, &amp; stand cheek-by-jowl   
 with large and small modern houses and
 bungalows, &amp; 19 Century houses. There 
 are 5 Listed Houses, 6 of Special     
 Interest and two large farmhouses. A  
 local Authority estate of flats,      
 houses &amp; bungalows is becoming owner- 
 occupied.                             
 There are two large farmhouses at     
{Tithby}and a few owner-occupied       
 properties.                           
 At{Tithby &amp; Wiverton}the farm cottages
 have all been modernised. Rushcliffe  
 Council are taking the Hall in hand to
 force a sale for it to be converted   
 into a viable project.
