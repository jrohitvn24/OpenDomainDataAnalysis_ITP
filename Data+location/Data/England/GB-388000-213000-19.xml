		<content>Some local {OAPs} remember the housing 
estates as farms and fields;and that   
there was"A big tree for meeting and   
not a town hall".{Social change} was   
also revealed in the statement "The    
nursing- homes are more crowded        
nowadays"(n.b... about 20% of the      
county's citizens are OAPs).           
But {kids} still play the traditional  
games-"Here it is,this is the lane.    
Quick run now,don't get caught,be quiet
Shhh! We can stop running now .They    
won't catch us.Here's the turning,up   
this hill,through the nettles.What was 
that? A gunshot.Quick run,it's steep.  
There's the gun again but he won't find
us here".                              
Times change though-"You can walk the  
rarely used footpaths by the brooks or 
wander alone out into the fields-nature
near a motorway".
