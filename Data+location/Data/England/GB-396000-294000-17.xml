		<content>  Shopkeepers say that business is not 
 good. Shops have{closed}in Wednesbury,
 Darlaston and Great Bridge. More      
 people say they go shopping by car to 
 places with parking like the Asda     
 stores in Darlaston and Tipton - many 
 go out of the area altogether to      
 Savacentre in Oldbury. By bus it is   
 just as easy for many people in the   
 area to go to Walsall, West Bromwich  
 or Dudley which are very close and    
 have bigger shopping centres with more
 shops to choose from.                 
  Changes to the roads around the Bull 
 Stake in Darlaston and Union Street in
 Wednesbury have made it easier and    
 safer to walk around the shops but    
 some people said they liked it better 
 the way it was before.
