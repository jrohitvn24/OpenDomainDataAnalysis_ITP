		<title>13CHURCH FARM MUSEUM</title>
		<content>  Church FARM Museum is the oldest     
 house in Hendon.In the late           
 seventeenth century it was owned by   
 the Kemp Family. The freehold was     
 bought by George Dunlop in 1842 and   
 remained in that family until sold to 
 the Council in 1944.                  
  The Museum today is very interesting,
 it has pieces of antique furniture and
 many Victorian accessories.The kitchen
 is as it was over 100 years ago.It    
 makes you realise just how much times 
 have changed. One of the most         
 interesting pieces of equipment is the
 nutmeg grater.                        
  In the garden is a large pond and two
 big trees, a cedar and a yew. There   
 is an old well and a gate.The garden  
 features little but is kept in good   
 condition.                            
  The Museum is well worth a visit.
