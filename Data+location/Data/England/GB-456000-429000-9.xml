		<content> Most of the area is flat agricultural 
 land,part of the Vale of York. The    
 Vale is almost completely covered by  
 thick glacial deposits and more recent
 river alluvium. Underlying these      
 deposits are layers of yellowish-red  
 sandstones which were laid down in    
 desert conditions during the Triassic 
 period,millions of years ago.         
 In a few locations the sandstone      
 stands out above the deposits in the  
 Vale. One of the most notable of these
 outcrops is Brayton Barff which is    
 visible for miles around. The top of  
 the Barff is covered with a deposit of
 glacial boulder clay much older than  
 that of the surrounding Vale.         
 From the top of the Barff there is an 
 excellent view to the towers of Selby 
 Abbey and York Minster and to the     
 southern edge of the North Yorkshire  
 Moors and the Wolds.                  </content>
