		<content>  There are two councils in Sidmouth,  
 the{East Devon District Council}and   
 the{Sidmouth Town Council.            
  Over 300 people work at the{East     
{Devon District Council}offices in 12  
 committees and 4 departments. This    
 includes clerks and solicitors and the
 areas of Health, Housing, Engineering,
 Planning and Finance. The Council     
 gives planning permission and helps   
 people to start shops, cafes and      
 hotels.                               
{ Sidmouth Town Council}comprises 19   
 Councillors who are elected to their  
 posts. The Town Council cleans the    
 town and keeps the old houses         
 preserved. The Town Council owns a lot
 of the land in the area. It helps the 
 District Council in various ways, for 
 example with Sidmouth's entry to the  
{Britain In Bloom}competition and with 
 the{Folk Festival.                    </content>
