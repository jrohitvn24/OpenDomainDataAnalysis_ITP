		<content>Penkridge station was built in the     
1870' by the London and North Western  
Railway. It has a building which the   
station master lived in and a small    
booking office and toilets. The Up     
platform is about 90 feet long and the 
Down platform has a wooden shelter. The
footbridge is of the newer type, built 
because the trains were too fast for   
the crossing.                          
Down the line is a goods shed where    
all the wares used to come in by train 
into Penkridge. Up the line is a       
junction where the Coal Board line     
joins. Here there is a signal box which
controls the movement of trains. The   
LMS took over the line in 1923 until   
1948 when British Rail took it over.   
The last man to live in the station was
in 1975, since then it has been        
vandalised. In 1984 the Manpower       
Services Commission cleaned it up.     </content>
