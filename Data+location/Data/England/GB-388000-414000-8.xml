		<title>08AN INTERVIEW WITH P.C.READER</title>
		<content> Louise Green and Marsha Logan         
 interviewed our local community       
 policeman, P.C. Eddie Reader.         
 "I enjoy my job, more than likely     
 because I like meeting and helping    
 people. On average I arrest one or two
 people a week for crime. On Saturdays 
 I believe that about half a dozen     
 children are arrested.                
  3,000 people a year join the police  
 force. Not many detectives carry guns.
 Only diplomatic bodyguards and guards 
 for the Queen and Prime Minister carry
 guns. It is a male orientated job but 
 now it is changing. Each policeman has
 his own number.                       
  I think uniforms will change with    
 fashion but not much.They will still  
 be the same colour, blue or black.    
  I would like my hours reduced,       
 but there aren't enough hours in the  
 day for the work I have to do."       </content>
