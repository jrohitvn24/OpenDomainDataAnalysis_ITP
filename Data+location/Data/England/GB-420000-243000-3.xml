{Silage}is grass which is fed to cattle
 in the winter time as an alternative  
 to{hay}.The green grass is mown,      
 collected and stored in a{clamp}or    
{tower}.It is packed in evenly and     
 sealed in with a plastic sheet.Then in
 the{winter}time a machine called a{   
{Precision Forager}feeds the silage to 
 a trough which the cattle feed from.  
                                       
{Organic Farming}is a method of farming
 which does not use gases,chemicals or 
 fertiliser.Instead the farmers plough 
 the land and use{manure}from the      
 cowshed to feed the fields.On one     
 farm,York Farm, the farmer keeps      
 cows,pigs,a milking cow,chickens and  
 goats which the farmer also milks.York
 Farm is half a mile outside{Ilmington}
 and it is much smaller than the other 
 farms in our block.                   </content>
