		<content>   There is a big barn which was built 
 in{1948. }In {1981}it was burnt down  
 by vandals.The fire was not discovered
 until the early hours of the morning, 
 when a glow was seen on the horizon.  
 It was rebuilt and now they are       
 building an extension to the barn.    
 The barn can hold{1000}tonnes of corn.
   The older barns were built about    
 1850.There are some old cart horse    
 stables where the wagons and traps    
 were kept.They are now used as extra  
 barns for storage and agricultural    
 machinery.                            
   After the second World War building 
 materials were scarce and they        
 purchased an old tin chapel with      
 typical windows in it.Ponies are kept 
 in there during the Winter.           
   The Cotswold stone pigsty is now a  
 greenhouse.
