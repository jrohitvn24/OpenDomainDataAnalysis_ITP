		<title>06THE GLOVE FACTORY, WOODSTOCK</title>
		<content>  The glove industry in Woodstock was  
thought to have been started off when  
people shot animals in Blenheim Park   
and made gloves out of them. They made 
gloves out of the skins of deer, lambs,
sheep and rabbits. The sheep skins now 
come from hot countries so they stretch
more.                                  
  There used to be five factories but  
now there is only one, which five      
people work in, whilst twenty-two      
people work at home.                   
  There are fourteen different         
processes for making the gloves. They  
cut thirty-six pairs a day. There are  
four different types of gloves and four
sizes. Queen Elizabeth had some and    
Priness Diana had a pair for her       
wedding. The factory has been famous   
for four hundred years. They make hats,
coats, hand bags, purses, shoes,       
slippers and belts as well.            </content>
