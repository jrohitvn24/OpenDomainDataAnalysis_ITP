		<content> Newspapers are delivered daily by     
 village children employed by a        
 Youlgrave newsagent. Papers delivered 
 are Express - 7: Mail - 5: Telegraph -
 4: Guardian - 3: Sun - 3: Mirror - 3: 
 Times - 3: Star - 1.                  
 There are two postal deliveries and   
 collections daily. A mobile library   
 visits the village fortnightly.       
 A survey in the village found that 80%
 of people use newspapers to gain      
 information about what is happening in
 the world. Almost everyone has a      
 television but only 56% use TV and    
 only 32% use radio for news. The      
 postal service is used by 68% and the 
 telephone by 56%. Only a small        
 percentage of homes have video        
 recorders and even fewer use the      
 mobile library.
