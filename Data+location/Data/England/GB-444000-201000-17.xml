		<title>17Religion in Wootton</title>
		<content>     Wootton has 3 churches, RC, C of E
 and Methodist.Only the Anglican church
 has  a {resident  vicar,}he also cares
 for Dry Sandford parish.              
     The church dates from at least the
 14th  Century, its  stone cross by the
 gate is 700 years old.It was first run
 from  the  Cumnor  parish, exactly 100
 years  ago  it became independent. The
 centenary was celebrated on St Peter's
 day by a Friday evening performance of
 harp  music  given  in  the Church.The
 Vicar  of Cumnor was invited to preach
 at the 10a.m. Sunday Service, this was
 followed   by   coffee  and  a  parish
 photograph  taken  outside  the church
 beneath  the{mass dial.}The grooves of
 the dial used to indicate the times of
 church  services. There  are  plans to
 build  a  wooden  gallery  inside  the
 church   to  house  a  new  organ  and
 provide more floor space.             </content>
