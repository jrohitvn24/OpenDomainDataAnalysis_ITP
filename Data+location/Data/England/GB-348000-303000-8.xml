		<content>{Condover Players-}stage a musical show
 and a play annually.The show provides 
 money to pay for maintaining the      
 village hall,a registered charity.So  
 the players do not pay a hire charge. 
 The players come from within 3 miles  
 of the village.They do not usually    
 write their own material or repeat a  
 show but they do make the scenery and 
 most of their costumes.During the     
 performance a meal is served to the   
 audience and there is a bar, so       
 consequently many more villagers are  
 involved than just the cast.Two       
 pianists share the music and provide  
 some percussion.There are 5           
 performances for each show and tickets
 vary in price according to the day.   
 Condover Hall and primary school      
 pupils attend the dress rehearsals    
 free.
