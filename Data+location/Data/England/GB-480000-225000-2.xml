Swithun,was built in 1230 of smooth    
ashlar limestone and included the      
chancel,nave and tower.It is the       
oldest building in Swanbourne.The font 
is original. In the 17th century the   
tower and south wall of the nave were  
rebuilt.The north wall has paintings of
Heaven,Hell,Death and Judgment of about
1500 but they are now faded and        
fragmentary.The church was restored in 
1863 and the exterior stonework in     
1973.                                  
     The church was a place of refuge  
from the King's forces in 1643 when the
villagers refused to pay 100 pounds.   
     There are brasses and tablets to  
Thomas Adams murdered in 1626;Thomas   
and Ann Deverell who died of smallpox  
within ten months of their marriage in 
1699;Josias Askew,lord of the
