		<title>11LANDSCAPE OF THE S. DOWNS</title>
		<content>   The landscape typical of the S.Downs
 is familiar to most people from photo-
 graphs but it is the N.face of the    
 downs with its steep slopes &amp; scarpes 
 which most often appear. The wooded   
 S.slopes are less familiar.           
    The downs above Heyshott &amp; Graffham
 illustrate the typical shapes of      
 downland gently undulating curves,    
 steep N.face often pitted by old      
 quarries, thickly wooded gullies &amp; the
 gentler slopes on the S.side.         
    The soil is composed of underlying 
 chalk &amp; flint with a thin covering of 
 clay. Chalk &amp; flints have broken      
 through the clay where it has been    
 ploughed &amp; the ground is very rough.  
    The climate is mild, with average  
 rainfall &amp; even in winter the snow is 
 seldom more than a thin covering. At  
 times the prevailing S.W. wind is very
 strong.                               </content>
