		<title>20THE ROMAN VILLA AT WITCOMBE</title>
		<content>We left school and walked up past the  
{reservoir} to the {villa}.Although it 
is very old it was easy to see where   
the walls,temple,heating system and    
baths were.We could see the main       
doorway and the buttresses to stop the 
villa falling down the hill.We went    
into a hut to see the remains of the   
{mosaic}. There was a lot of it left   
and we could see the main picture of   
fish and sea creatures.The water for   
the villa came from a {spring} and     
everyone had a drink from it.We looked 
around,answered work- sheets and spoke 
to the teachers about it all.We then   
headed back to school. Emma fell and   
hurt her ankle so our teacher gave her 
a piggy-back to school.After half an   
hour we were there and went to our     
sports lesson very tired but talking   
about our morning trip.
