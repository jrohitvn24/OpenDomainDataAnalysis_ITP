		<content> HOUND TRAILS attract a considerable   
 following and can take place virtually
 any where at the permission of the    
 local landowner.                      
 The dogs used are the same as those   
 used for hunting foxes but are kept by
 individuals rather than being kept as 
 a pack. The trail is set by a man who 
 drags a pile of rags soaked in a      
 mixture of paraffin and aniseed over  
 several miles of countryside.When it  
 is complete the dogs are released and 
 run a circular course returning to    
 their owners who encourage them with  
 shouts,whistles and a bowl of food.   
 Competition is fierce and betting on  
 favoured dogs is often heavy.         
 The dogs are exercised regularly and  
 trained for big events as             
 conscientiously as an athlete.
