		<title>17Bunyan Meeting</title>
		<content> The Bunyan Chapel was built in 1885 as
 a Sunday School for 100 children from 
 the parish with 26 teachers.This year 
 a service was held on the 19th May to 
 celebrate 100 years of the chapel.    
 Worship was enhanced by readings and  
 choruses from the children and a short
 history of the chapel.The service also
 included the annual prize-giving.     
 Numbers are increasing at the Sunday  
 School where around 15 children aged  
 4-12 regularly attend.The chapel now  
 has a new minister who together with  
 an associate minister work in the     
 pastorate of the 5 Bunyan churches in 
 Bedford, Goldington, Elstow, Kempston 
 and Stagsden.
