		<title>01Peterborough, Orton/Fletton</title>
		<content> This area to the South East of the    
 City of Peterborough is one which     
 shows the differing stages of the     
 city's development.  Old Orton        
 Longueville dates back to 1200 AD,    
 whilst most of Fletton dates from 1850
 onwards.   Orton Malborne is the      
 second of the areas to be developed   
 from scratch as part of Peterborough's
 expansion under the New Towns Act of  
 Parliament in the 1960's. The area    
 contains extensive brick workings and 
 newer undustrial areas. Peterborugh   
 has developed on the edge of the fen  
 and none of this area is very         
 elevated.   Unemployment in the area  
 is about 15% of the working population
 and those working find employment     
 throughout the city, with some        
 commuting to London.  The area tends  
 to experience mild weather though     
 winds blow regularly across the fens. </content>
