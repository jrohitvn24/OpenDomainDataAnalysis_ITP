		<title>19HEALTH - BORDEAN HOUSE (2)</title>
		<content> The establishment was originally run  
 by nuns, but when financial           
 difficulties arose, they approached   
 Lady Ryder, who accepted the task of  
 making the house comply to fire       
 regulations. An agreement was also    
 made with Portsmouth Hospital, who    
 wanted Bordean House to put aside some
 of the beds for their cancer          
 patients. The house is leased to Lady 
 Ryder and some nuns still live there  
 along with a priest who runs the      
 Catholic/Church of England chapel.    
 Every week a mobile library visits for
 the residents. A shop facility is also
 offered by the W.R.V.S twice a week.  
 Also, a bus service occasionally takes
 the willing residents to the nearest  
 town-Petersfield.                     
 All the inmates are very happy to be  
 there. {
