		<content> Since the accession of Elizabeth 2nd, 
 the population of Bramhope has risen  
 from 1898 to 3395.The rural character 
 of the village has disappeared        
 following the development of several  
 housing estates,the provision of      
 street-lighting and the building of a 
 larger Primary School,the Middle      
 School and Health Centre,a new        
 shopping-parade in Eastgate and a unit
 of 30 flats for elderly residents at  
 "Rosemont."The 2 church buildings have
 been extended,the 3 garages have      
 expanded and branches of 2 banks and a
 building society have been opened.In  
 1978,Bramhope became part of the Leeds
 Metropoliton District,the Parish      
 Council retaining control of          
 recreation areas,pavements and        
 building applications.Alongside the   
 17th cent.Puritan Chapel,the Post     
 House Hotel was opened in 1971.       </content>
