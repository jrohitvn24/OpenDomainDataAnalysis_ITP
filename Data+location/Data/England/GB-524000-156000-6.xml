		<title>06Belvedere House, Banstead</title>
		<content> Belvedere House is marked as a        
 hospital and lies to the south of     
 Banstead in Holly Lane. It is in fact 
 a home of 62 residents belonging to   
 the Royal Alfred Seamen Society. Half 
 of these residents are able bodied and
 live in rooms on the first floor which
 are known as cabins. Downstairs there 
 are 8 wards of various sizes and an   
 intensive care room. The society was  
 formed in 1867 to found a hospital for
 worn out and disabled sailors and was 
 given Royal permission to name itself 
 after His Royal Highness Prince       
 Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. The        
 original hospital was at Belvedere in 
 Kent and the name was retained when it
 moved to Banstead in 1978. It now     
 opens its doors to naval officers and 
 ratings of the Royal Navy and their   
 widows as well as retired merchant    
 seamen.                               </content>
