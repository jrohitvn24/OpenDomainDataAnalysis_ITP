		<content> There are no major roads in this block
 except for a 1km stretch of the A2 and
 a small section of the B2065, Elham   
 Valley road. The few roads that exist 
 are one-vehicle wide, with passing    
 places, leading to outlying farms and 
 small villages to the west. No public 
 transport runs across this area. The  
 railway closed in 1946. A Bus Service,
 617,Canterbury/Folkestone, runs hourly
 in both directions, Monday - Saturday,
 and will stop on the outskirts of     
 Bishopsbourne and Kingston. Canterbury
 /Dover,615, and Canterbury/Folkestone,
 616, are also available to Bishops-   
 bourne on the B2065 before turning on-
 to the A2, missing Kingston. Because  
 there is a lack of public transport   
 serving the communities directly, most
 families have a car but despite this  
 fact, there are no garages or petrol  
 stations in this block.               </content>
