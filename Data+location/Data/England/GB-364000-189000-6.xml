		<content> The area has a lot of land which is   
 not built on but is used for farming. 
 All the farmers own their farms, there
 are no tenant farms. Some of the farms
 have decreased in size as they have   
 sold some of their land for building  
 new housing estates, schools or       
 motorway development. The average     
 size of each farm is approximately one
 hundred and fifty to two hundred      
 acres. Most of the land is pasture as 
 the farmers concentrate on dairy      
 farming, beef and sheep rearing. The  
 farms have been in local families for 
 many years and the farm buildings are 
 very old. The farm work is done by the
 families themselves using a great deal
 of modern machinery and very little   
 local labour.
