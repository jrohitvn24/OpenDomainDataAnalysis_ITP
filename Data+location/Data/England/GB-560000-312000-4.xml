		<content> Small-scale farming is largely gone   
 from the area, as only large farms are
 now economically viable. The farms    
 which cover the area utilise a great  
 deal of expensive machinery but fewer 
 full-time workers than was previously 
 the case. This means that many local  
 families have had to look elsewhere   
 for employment.                       
                                       
 A great variety of crops is grown in  
 this very flat area which is          
 esentially re-claimed river-delta/sea 
 marsh, and so is extremely fertile.   
 All the farms are arable, though there
 are a very few animals kept, including
 goats, chickens and turkeys.          
                                       
 A few villagers, and some recent      
 arrivals, have set up small-holdings  
 comprising a few hectares and         
 buildings, to supplement a main job.  </content>
