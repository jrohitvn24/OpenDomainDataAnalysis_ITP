 GAMES PLAYED AT HOME AND AT SCHOOL.   
      We play lots of games at school  
 and at home.                          
      We usually play games with a     
 variable number of people,like 1,2,3, 
 home,Chain Tig,May I?,Pop Groups and  
 Polo.                                 
      Games that we play at home are   
 usually with a small group of children
 in a confined area.Two of the         
 games that we play are Granny's       
 Footsteps and Peep Behind the Curtain.
         At home a lot of games are    
 make believe,like Gypsies,horses etc. 
 The most popular games at our school  
 are ball games like football,tennis,  
 sevens and marbles.In marbles you have
 to hit each others marbles and the one
 who hits the other first takes both   
 marbles.                              
                                       </content>
