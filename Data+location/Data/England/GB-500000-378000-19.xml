		<content> TASK GROUP PUBLIC MEETING:JUNE 1985.  
 After various meetings in the two     
 villages and a joint staff meeting of 
 the two schools a public meeting was  
 held in Lincoln. This meeting was very
 well attended and strong              
 representation was made by the local  
 people to keep both schools in their  
 present forms. Both schools perform   
 valuable functions within their       
 respective villages, not only the     
 school function, but Youth Clubs and  
 Evening Institute Classes. It was also
 pointed out that neither school could 
 accommodate all the pupils in the area
 and so it would cost more to bus      
 children from one school to another.  
 Local people will now have to wait    
 until the Autumn to hear the two      
 recommendations from the Task Group   
 which will be put before the Council  
 for action.                           </content>
