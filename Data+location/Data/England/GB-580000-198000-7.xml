		<title>07Farm Machinery</title>
		<content>     Production on the farm has greatly
  increased due to the advanced        
 machinery now used.At{Charity Farm}we 
 saw Case, County, John Deere, Hesston 
 and International and  tractors. They 
 are far larger than the  older types  
 and have enclosed cabins, more power, 
 larger wheels and many more scientific
 agricultural attachments.             
    The combine harvester was the most 
 impressive piece of machinery. The    
 wheels were higher than our teacher is
 tall and two children could fit inside
 the wheel hub. The eight-wheeled      
 tractor was enormous. Some farmers had
 kept 1948 model tractors as a reminder
 of harder times. We also saw tankers  
 which contain spray, rape swathers,   
 dressers and gigantic fans working a  
 cooling system for the grain.         
    The most important machinery on the
 dairy farm was the milking machine.   </content>
