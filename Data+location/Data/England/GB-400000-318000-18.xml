		<title>18The N.E. Chase.</title>
		<content> This is an area of gradually rising   
ground to a height of 152 metres. There
is a pleasant valley which has public  
access with many footpaths that lead   
further into the Chase. There is much  
deciduous woodland with a stream       
flowing northwards to the River Trent. 
The land is marshy. There is a large   
herd of fallow deer which frequent this
area. Part of the area is marked as a  
Danger Area because of its use as a    
Rifle Range with 12 butts and a range  
of 300 metres. There are also disused  
sand and gravel pits in this part. Some
of the land is open scrub where there  
is evidence of much wildlife. Bracken  
covers much of this scrubland together 
with rose bay willow herb. To the      
eastern edge of the Chase there is a   
pleasant valley through which flows the
Stafford Brook. There is the site of a 
former mill and disused mill pond.     </content>
