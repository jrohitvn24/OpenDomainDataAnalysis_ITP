		<title>09Erisey Manor Farm</title>
		<content> Three kilometres north of Ruan Minor  
 is an old manor house.It is called    
 Erisey because a very important family
 called  Erisey used to live there in  
 the 13th century.James Erisey was     
 Sheriff of Cornwall in 1512 and       
 1513.In memory of James Erisey and his
 wife Margaret there is a brass of them
 in Grade Church showing that James    
 died in 1522.When Richard Erisey died 
 in 1722 there was no direct male heir 
 in the family so much of the Erisey's 
 valuable furniture in the old manor   
 house was taken away.Now it is a farm 
 used for beef,sheep and corn.At the   
 front are two large pillars dated     
 1673.Around the door are the letters R
 and M and the date 1620.There is a    
 barn made from cut serpentine from    
 Poltesco.There are two pillars at the 
 back dated 1671.There is an old garden
 probably used by the old Eriseys.     </content>
