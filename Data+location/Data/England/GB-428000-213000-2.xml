		<content>A Saturday.                            
        I would get up at 7.30 am and  
have breakfast at 8.30. I normally have
Branflakes for breakfast. At 10.00 we  
go for a ride. Sometimes we go along   
the air field. The airfield was used in
the Second World War. I hate to think  
of all the people being killed. There  
is a runway stretching all the way     
round the enormous field. There are    
sheep grazing on it now but it will    
never be used again. I hope there will 
never be a war again. When we get home 
it would be lunch time. It is normally 
bread and cheese for lunch, lunch is   
about 1.30pm. After lunch I would help 
Dad or Mum in the garden. We have three
acres of land, mostly wood. At 4.00pm  
we go down to Fordwells on our bikes   
and do the horses. When we get back we 
have our supper. Mum is a vegetarian.
