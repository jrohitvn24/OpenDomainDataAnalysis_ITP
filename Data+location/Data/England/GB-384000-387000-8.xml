		<content>    A TYPICAL WEEKEND FOR THE BENNETT  
 FAMILY. I WOULD STAY IN BED UNTIL     
 10 AM THEN I GET UP. DAD HAS USUALLY  
 GONE TO WORK SO I HAVE BREAKFAST AND  
 HELP MOTHER AND SOMETIMES DO HOMEWORK.
 MY UNCLE TAKES MY SISTER AND I TO THE 
 LIBRARY AND OFTEN WE GO TO GRANS FOR A
 WHILE. IF DAD COMES HOME FOR DINNER   
 THERE IS A HOPE OF AN OUTING IN THE   
 AFTERNOON BUT HE HAS BEEN BUSY LATELY 
 AND THE WEATHER HASN'T BEEN GOOD.     
    IN WINTER WE ENJOY CARD GAMES AND  
 MONOPOLY, ALSO I AM LEARNING CHESS. I 
 LIKE IT WHEN GRAN AND GRANDPA COME FOR
 TEA. WE HAVE LOTS OF FUN. THEN I      
 SERENADE THEM HOME WITH A TUNE ON THE 
 VIOLIN. IF THE WEATHER IS FINE IN THE 
 SUMMER I AM OUTDOORS, CLIMBING IN WILD
 BOAR CLOUGH OR VISITING SOME BEAUTY   
 SPOT AND OF COURSE ENJOYING A BARBEQUE
 ALSO.                                 
                                       </content>
