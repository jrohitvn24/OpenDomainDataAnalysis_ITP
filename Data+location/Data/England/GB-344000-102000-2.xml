		<content> Dorset is shared by us with           
 animals,birds,fish and plants,etc.    
  The countryside teams with rabbits,  
 and warrens are found quite frequently
 in hedges and sandbanks.              
  Poachers lay rabbit snares and shoot 
 the creatures with silenced shotguns  
 and sometimes use rabbit-poison which 
 kills straight-away or causes         
 myxomatosis.Poison is banned but      
 poachers still use it.                
  Rabbits have a habit of stopping     
 right in their tracks if a light is   
 shone in their eyes.                  
  Farmers shoot rabbits to keep them   
 from damaging corn before the roots   
 can settle.inspite of all the         
 shooting,the population is large and  
 increasing.Rabbits can be eaten in    
 stew or with onion sauce or parsley.
