		<title>13Waves Farm.</title>
		<content> Waves farm covers 220 acres of land   
 and is owned by the Wright family.    
 They have recently lost ten acres     
 because of the new Lincoln by-pass. Mr
 Wright is the uncle of the owner of   
 Lowfields farm, which is also in our  
 area. The Wrights keep a dairy herd   
 which have to be milked twice a day,  
 once in the morning and once in the   
 evening. Seven cows can be milked at  
 the same time. After milking the milk 
 is pumped into a huge tanker and taken
 to Boultham Park Dairy.               
 The farmer also keeps chickens, guinea
 fowl and two horses. One of the horses
 came second at the Lincolnshire Show. 
 There are many old buildings on the   
 farm which are having to be rebuilt   
 or repaired. They have had a new barn 
 built recently.
