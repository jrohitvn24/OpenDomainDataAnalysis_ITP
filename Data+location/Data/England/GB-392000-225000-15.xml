 oldest grave stone was dated 1625.    
 The next oldest was 1695 and belonged 
 to Suzanna Lyle. It said              
  {"Here  resteth the body of Suzanne  
{Lyle,widow,who was buried on the 9th  
{March A.D.1695 aged 61 years "}       
 Some of the oldest graves were the    
 best preserved because they were under
 the trees. The oldest trees were the  
 Yews ; they might even be as old as   
 some of the graves.
