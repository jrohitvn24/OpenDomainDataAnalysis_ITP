		<title>09    A BUTTERLEIGH FARM</title>
		<content>     West Pitt Farm is 2.5 kilometres  
    from the village of Butterleigh    
 itself.                               
     It is not a specialist farm.They  
 have 500 sheep(of which 220 are       
 breeding ewes),50 friesians,30 heifers
 and 100 beef animals.When the sheep   
 are ill Mr and Mrs Spencer,the owners 
 of the farm and their farm-worker     
 William treat them themselves.        
 Otherwise they go to their local vet  
 in Tiverton.They have 200 acres which 
 are mostly on slopes.This is a problem
 especially in Winter.(Lorries also    
 have difficulty driving down the lanes
 to collect the milk).                 
     They grow no crops except grass   
 for silage and hay for their          
 animals.They don't go to market very  
 often except to buy a ram and when    
 they do they go to {Exeter }or {      
{Taunton.                              </content>
