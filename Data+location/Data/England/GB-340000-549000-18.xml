		<title>18THE LOSH FAMILY _ WREAY(I)</title>
		<content> Most of the land around Wreay used to 
 belong to the Losh family.In the 18th 
 century the "laird" was John Losh,    
 known popularly as{"The Big Black     
{Squire"}.He was the last of the       
 Cumberland squirearchy to take part in
 the border expeditions that ended     
 after the 1745 rebellion.He had 8     
 children,most of whom became          
 successful businessmen.His eldest son 
 settled on the Woodside Estate near   
 Wreay.He has left his mark on the     
 district because,being a prominent    
 agriculturist,he was responsible for  
 introducing Italian rye grass into    
 Cumberland and for planting a large   
 number of larch and oak trees.These   
 are still a feature of the area.He was
 interested in the connection between  
 chemistry and agriculture and his     
 experiments at Woodside led local folk
 to suspect witchcraft and magic.      </content>
