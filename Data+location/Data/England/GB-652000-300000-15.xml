		<title>15Visitors views, Hopton.</title>
		<content> The places where the holiday makers   
 were staying                          
 are: 21 = Ponderosa, 17 = Holimarine, 
 3 = potter's, (Potter's wasn't in our 
 square,) &amp; 4 others were staying      
 either in hotels or with friends.     
    There wasn't a general place where 
 the majority of people came from. Most
 people had looked in magazines, papers
 or found out from a friend about      
 Hopton. A few people had just come to 
 the area on speck. It was near enough 
 a 50/50 split on the no. of people who
 had come before.80% of the people     
 would come again. Many people thought 
 entertainment was adaquate but could  
 be improved with more things for the  
 younger generation.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
