		<title>11BISHOPS LYDEARD CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> Every year there is a village         
 Carnival when people individually,in  
 social groups or as village           
 organisations parade through the      
 village on a Saturday afternoon for   
 the enjoyment of others.The larger    
 groups usually construct floats on    
 farm trailers or on lorries to give a 
 backcloth to the people dressed to    
 indicate a theme.There is usually     
 appropiate music playing loudly       
 through speakers on the float.There   
 are also individuals dressed up and   
 walking or riding in many ways.There  
 are classes of entries with cups      
 awarded to the winners and before the 
 Carnival there is great secrecy about 
 each group's entry and on the day much
 commenting between entries-but never  
 malicious.Heading the Carnival is a   
 band and the elected Carnival Queen   
 and her attendants.                   </content>
