		<title>09THE CROMFORD CANAL PAST</title>
		<content>  {The Cromford Canal}was built in the 
 1770's and stretched from the River   
 Trent at Langley Mill to Cromford,    
 near Matlock in Derbyshire: a distance
 of 17 miles.                          
   The canal was originally built to   
 serve the{Arkwright cotton mill}at    
 Cromford transferring cotton from     
 there to the{River Trent.             
   There were originally 2 tunnels on  
 the canal: the{Butterley,}which was   
 3063 yards long, and the{Heage,}which 
 was 93 yards long and had a towpath.  
 There were also 2 aquaducts between   
 Ambergate and Cromford.               
   The canal ceased to function        
 properly around 1900 when the         
{Butterley}tunnel collapsed and        
 effectively cut the canal in          
 half.However, it was still used until 
 1943 when trade finally ended.
