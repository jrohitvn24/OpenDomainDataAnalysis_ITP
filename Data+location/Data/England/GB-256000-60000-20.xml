		<title>20LEE MOOR AREA-THE FUTURE?.</title>
		<content> It seems likely that the extraction of
 china clay in the area will continue  
 for many years to come.It has been    
 estimated that there may be enough    
 china clay in the area to keep the    
 industry going for another hundred    
 years.It will mainly depend on the    
 demand for china clay.At the moment   
 the demand is increasing.It is        
 intended by both companies (English   
 China Clays and Watts,Blake,Bearn) to 
 landscape the area ,which will result 
 in two lakes being formed,called Lee  
 Moor Lake and Hemerdon Lake.As well as
 this it is envisaged that there will  
 be three terraced tips ,grassed on    
 their upper slopes and planted with   
 trees on the lower slopes.It is       
 thought that these lakes could be used
 as reservoirs and the whole area      
 considered as a'country park'.When    
 this might be is difficult to know.   </content>
