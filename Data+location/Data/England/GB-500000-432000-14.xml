		<title>14The Lawns.</title>
		<content>  My group has chosen to visit The     
 Lawns. The Lawns is place where       
 students of Hull University live while
 they are studying at the University.  
 The first things that we saw were a   
 bus stop and a huge car park. The     
 Lawns is a long way from Hull         
 University and so the bus service is  
 very important to the students. We    
 went to The Lawns Centre first, which 
 is a huge building. In the building   
 there was a bar, a dance floor, a T.V.
 and many other small rooms. No        
 students live in the Centre and so we 
 were shown to one of the Halls where  
 the students live. We were lucky      
 because one of our girl's mums works  
 as a housekeeper in a Hall. She met us
 outside the Hall with a big bunch of  
 keys.
