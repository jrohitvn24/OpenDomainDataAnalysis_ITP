		<title>11CORONATION PARK</title>
		<content>{Coronation Park,}named in honour of{  
{Queen Victoria's Coronation}originally
 belonged to {Jesse Boot,}founder of   
 Boot's Chemists.                      
 The park has been designed with the   
{handicapped}in mind,and there are many
 ramps to make it easy for people in   
 wheelchairs to visit.                 
 Inside, apart from lawns and flower   
 beds, there is a large children's     
 playground,paddling pool and a pond   
 for model boats.                      
 The park receives its water from an   
 underground stream running from St.   
 Lawrence to the beach.                
 Where the park is now once was only   
 sand dunes, and if you dig down you   
 very soon come to pure sand.          
 Next to the park are the{Recreation   
{Grounds }where you can play football, 
 hockey, cricket and tennis.
