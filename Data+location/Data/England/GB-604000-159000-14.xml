		<content>   My neighbours on the right side     
 are very nice and gay.                
 But my neighbours on the left side    
 are as nasty as can be.               
 When I play with the girl on the right
 we always walk together and chat.     
 But the girl on the left side         
 is very cruel and mean.               
   When the people on the right side   
 need to borrow things they ask nicely.
 But when the people on the left side  
 need to borrow things they always ask 
 miserably and shout about it.         
   My neighbours on the right side     
 will always play snooker with dad.    
 But the neighbours on the left will   
 play,but if they lose,will not talk.  
   One neighbour is quiet and gay.     
 The others are noisey and clumsy.     
   I WONDER IF THEY LIKE ME?
