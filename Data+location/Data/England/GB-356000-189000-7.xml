		<title>07Working at Aust Services</title>
		<content> At Aust Services all the workers      
 seemed to be very busy. We interviewed
 several workers and learnt that most  
 employees lived between two and eight 
 miles away and the company provided   
 transport to and from work .A woman in
 the snack-bar said she worked from    
 8.30a.m to 5.30p.m.One of her         
 assistants worked from 7.00a.m to     
 2.30p.m. A cashier said she worked    
 eight hours a day but the time she had
 to start work varied. Because the     
 services are open twenty-four hours a 
 day ,employees work on a shift system.
 Those people we spoke to seemed to    
 enjoy their work and meeting people.
