		<title>10YOULSTON PARK</title>
		<content>{Youlston Park}has an area of 100      
 acres and is directly in front of     
 Youlston Close,which is made up of 1  
 house and 7 bungalows. Youlston Park  
 used to have many trees in it but     
 recently some have been chopped down. 
   Youlston Park is not a place where  
 children go to play on swings but it  
 is a private estate once owned by the 
 renowned Chichester family.  A clump  
 of trees at the front beside the A39  
 makes the park easily identifiable.   
   The owner of Youlston park lets the 
 park out to other people to keep      
 animals in it and sometimes he will   
 keep deer and other grass eating      
 animals in the park to keep the grass 
 short.                                
   The park used to be let out to a    
 cricket team but the owner claimed    
 they were ruining the grass.  A major 
 fair has recently been held there.    </content>
