		<title>14POLICE WORK IN TYWARDREATH</title>
		<content> Our area comes within the{Devon and   
{Cornwall Force.} The area{            
{head-quarters are at Exeter}and the{  
{Divisional Control Room is at         
{Launceston.} That is where 999 calls  
 go and where radio calls come from.   
 There are two police houses at        
 Tywardreath and a{Police Station.} It 
 has a front office and general offices
 but no cells. For this people are     
 taken to St. Austell where they are   
 also finger-printed and photographed. 
 We have 5  policemen who drive panda  
 cars, 2 community policemen, 2        
 sergeants and a C.I.D. member. They   
 work an 8 hour shift system and the   
 work is unpredictable: it could be an 
 accident, a burglary or a missing     
 person.                               
{Crime is rare,}mostly vandalism, as   
 there is a strong community feeling.
