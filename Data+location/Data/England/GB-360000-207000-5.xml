		<content> Parkend A.F.C. is in the first        
 division of the North Gloucestershire 
 League, and finished fifth in the     
 1984/85 season.Only three of the      
 players actually live in the village, 
 but a couple more do have family      
 connections with Parkend.Home games   
 have about 10 regular spectators at   
 their home games on the Playing Field 
 in  the  centre  of the               
 village.Players' cars are used as     
 transport to away matches to other    
 villages, mainly in the Forest, the   
 furthest team visited being in        
 Gloucester. The club is currently     
 working on plans for new changing     
 quarters and showers.Funds are raised 
 by holding stalls at the village      
 Carnival sponsored events and a       
 harvest festival.
