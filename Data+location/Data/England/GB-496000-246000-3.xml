 However within these annual figures   
 there is often seasonal variation:    
                       1980     1981   
 March,April,May       3.65"    8.6"   
 June,July August     10.2"     4.8"   
 In this arable farming area a wet     
 growing period and dry ripening and   
 harvest is preferable.                
 Summer 1985 has been notable for being
 one of the wettest in living memory   
 within England and Wales.Here in 10   
 months only 11.5" has fallen (about   
 o.5 the annual average) In July 1985  
 only 1.7"of rain fell- only 2 months  
 have been drier in the last 6         
 years.Many of the storms which swept  
 the country missed this area.However  
 the rain did cause some problems and  
 battered down crops.                  </content>
