		<title>11THE BEACH IN EAST MERSEA</title>
		<content>  In June 1985 a study of the beach    
 revealed two swans,4 cygnets,         
 barnacles, whelks, mussels, cockles, a
 number of jellyfish and a variety of  
 different seaweeds.                   
   On the beach 5 habitats were        
 identified;                           
 1) An area of grassland on the        
 landward margin.                      
 2) This was replaced towards the sea  
 by an area of sand with scattered     
 clumps of grass.                      
 3) The grass disappeared and an area  
 of bare sand was found.               
 4)The sandy area was succeeded by an  
 area of coarse shingle.               
 5) At the sea's edge there was an area
 of finer more compact shingle.        
   People on the beach were interviewed
 and most of them said they liked the  
 fresh air and quiet and would not     
 welcome commercialisation of the beach</content>
