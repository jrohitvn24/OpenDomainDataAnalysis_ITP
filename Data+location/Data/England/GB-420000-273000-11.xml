		<title>11EDUCATION IN BALSALL COMMON</title>
		<content> The first school in Balsall Common was
 built by the Church of England in 1875
 about 100 metres away from the present
 school. It consisted of 16 children in
 one room about the size of a modern   
 temporary classroom.                  
          In 1879 the school had 57    
 children and 11 years later 73        
 children. This classroom was lit by   
 candles and heated by a coal fire. In 
 1913 the council took over Education  
 and the school moved across the road. 
 It had four classrooms, cloakrooms    
 and a handicraft room. Subjects       
 included cookery, needlework woodwork 
 and growing flowers and vegtables.    
 Water came from a pump and candles and
 coal fires were still used. It started
 with 70 children but soon all the     
 classrooms were filled.
