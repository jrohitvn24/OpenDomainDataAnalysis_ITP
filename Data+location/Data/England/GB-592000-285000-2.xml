		<content> From the returns to our survey, the   
 following age pattern is shown:       
                                       
      Ages  0-15 ..... 20%             
      Ages 16-25 .....  6%             
      Ages 26-45 ..... 29%             
      Ages 46-65 ..... 24%             
      Age  65 +  ..... 21%             
                                       
 Quite clearly, the young adult is the 
 least well represented.  The reasons  
 are no doubt very similar for many    
 other small villages:  a lack of      
 employment opportunities in the       
 immediate locality, loss of village   
 amenities and the nature of the       
 property market, with its very high   
 percentage of owner occupied          
 properties, usually beyond the means  
 of young, first-time buyers.  It seems
 unlikely that our present 20% of      
 youngsters will remain in Bridgham.   </content>
