 workshop next to our house where he   
 mends{vehicles,}some of which are     
 brought in from Germany and France.In 
 the{workshop}is a six foot crane, a   
 welding torch for metal, a paint      
 stripper and a sander that sands down 
 body filler. My brother, who is

 sometimes when we are not at school.  
 My dad is supplied with the{cars}to   
 repair, respray and test and then they
 can be sold. He works mainly on Ford  
 Escorts and Cortinas, or Land Rovers. 
 We have fourteen vehicles in our yard 
 as well as a scrap heap and a store   
 for spares. We have two vehicles, a   
 Thames 15cwt.van and a 100E Ford
