		<title>10 Housing Estates.</title>
		<content>                                       
 Many people in Tamworth live on       
housing estates. The Leyfields,        
Perrycrofts, Gillway, Belgrave and     
Glascote Heath are examples of housing 
estates in Tamworth.                   
 There are areas of housing in         
Tamworth which are centred on {old     
villages}, for example Glascote,       
Amington and Two Gates.                
 Glascote Heath housing estate got its 
name because it was built on the high  
heathland near the {original village}  
of Glascote. The name Amington Heath   
has been given for a similar reason.   
 Many of the new housing estates in    
Tamworth have been created to deal with
the {influx} of people from Birmingham 
who have moved to the town during the  
last twenty years
