 miles from Retford. Kirton is a much  
 smaller village standing on the A6075 
 two miles out of Ollerton on the      
 Tuxford road. The two villages are    
 joined by a narrow, winding minor     
 road. The name Walesby is Scandinavian
 in derivation meaning "Val's          
 village and Kirton is Anglo-Saxon     
 meaning "Church Farm. Both            
 villages are on the eastern edge of   
 the North Nottinghamshire coalfield   
 close to Sherwood Forest and the large
 estates of Thoresby and Clumber. The  
 area within the block is mainly rural 
 with a number of small wooded areas.  
 The county constituency boundary also 
 runs through the northern part of the 
 area, separating the Newark and       
 Bassetlaw districts.
