   Norfolk folklore is strange for it  
doesn't really exist except in proverbs
and customs.                           
PROVERBS                               
   A ground sweat cures all disorders -
   When you're dead you can't suffer   
   illness!                            
   He has a Friday look - he is sulky. 
   He lies bare of a suit - he has no  
   money.                              
   He will make a tight old man - he's 
   a lazy man.                         
   There's a bad sheep in every flock. 
   Never sell your hen on a rainy day. 
CUSTOMS- Pot days                      
   It was the custom in some farmhouses
to cook only 3 times a week.  An       
uninvited guest would therefore try to 
work out which day the pot would be on 
the stove and would say, "I'll go today
for its pot day" hoping for a hot meal.</content>
