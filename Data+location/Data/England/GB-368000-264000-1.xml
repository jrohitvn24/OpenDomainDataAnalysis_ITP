		<content> The area within this block is rural.  
 This part of Worcestershire was       
 predominantly a fruit growing area    
 until fairly recently, when EEC       
 regulations made small fruit farms    
 uneconomical and offered financial    
 incentives to the farmers if they     
 grubbed up their trees and bushes.    
 The road from Stanford to Clifton at  
 one time formed part of a "blossom    
 route" favoured by tourists. It       
 remains a very attractive area.       
 Stanford was dominated by the         
 Winnington family, of Stanford Court. 
 The farms which still belong to the   
 Estate have well-built houses with    
 land of a manageable area.            
 Stanford is well-kept by the caring   
 local residents.  It is in a fairly   
 prosperous area,  peopled by farmers, 
 business people and professionals.
