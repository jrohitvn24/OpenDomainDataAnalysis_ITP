 There are no schools in Camber itself;
 all children have to travel to Rye,   
 the small children by coach and the   
 older ones by public transport.  There
 is some concern about the very young  
 children being away from home for so  
 long, but to maintain the standard    
 this is considered the better option. 
 Schooling is imaginitive and the      
 results from the examinations are     
 good. If children and their parents   
 are keen to obtain the best education,
 the opportunity is there.  In further 
 education the problem of transport    
 does arise, as buses from Camber do   
 not coincide with the train times to  
 Hastings, the nearest town with       
 technical college facilities. There is
 an open-air swimming pool at the      
 junior school in Rye.
