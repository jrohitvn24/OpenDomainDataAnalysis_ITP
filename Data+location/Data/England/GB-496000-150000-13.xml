		<content>    In our playground we play a variety
 of games. Girls of about eight play   
 clapping games while girls of twelve  
 like to sit and chatter.Nine year olds
 play skipping games with rhymes like: 
{"I'm a little bumper car,             
{ Number forty eight,                  
{ I whizz round the corner,            
{ Stamp on the brakes,                 
{ Copper came and caught me,           
{ Put me in jail,                      
{ All I drank was some bottles of ale, 
{ How many bottles did I drink?"       
 Boys play football and games that     
 involve running such as Britsh        
 Bulldog, although it is against the   
 rules. We often have seasonal crazes  
 such as marbles in spring, conkers in 
 autumn and leapfrog. On the playground
 games like football,lines and "it" can
 be played all year round. We are lucky
 to have a very large play area.       </content>
