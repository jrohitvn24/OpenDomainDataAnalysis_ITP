		<content> The Village Hall at E. Preston cont.  
 range and auction room but recently   
 has been renovated. It is now an      
 attractive meeting place with and     
 interesting programme of events.      
                                       
 The Guides in East Preston.           
 Mrs Hoskins started the first company 
 in 1931. Lady Rachel Howard was a     
 Commissioner and guiders met in       
 Arundel Castle. The uniform was a blue
 dress with a royal blue tie. During   
 the 39-45 war people from Ecclesdon   
 Manor gave the guides chocolate which 
 was difficult to buy. Once when       
 camping, a tramp stole meat from their
 cooking pot.                          
                                       
 The Festival in East Preston.         
 The Village Hall is the focal point   
 for this annual event held in June.   
 Local clubs and societies organise    </content>
