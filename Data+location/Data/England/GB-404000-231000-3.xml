{House.}Lord Neidpath is the son of    
 David Charteris, 12th Earl of Wemyss  
 and March. He is 37 and was educated  
 at Eton. Catherine Neidpath is 33. She
 is the daughter of Jonathan Guinness  
 and was educated at Cobham. They have 
 been married for 2 years. Their baby  
 is 9 months old and is called Francis 
 Richard Charteris, but they call him  
 Dick. He will probably go to Didbrook 
 School when he is 4. They own 2 Arab  
 horses and a yellow labrador called   
 Smelley. They prefer to live in the   
 country but a sixth of the time they  
 spend in London or Scotland. Their    
 hobbies are gardening, skiing, and    
 history. In her spare time Lady       
 Neidpath supervises the house, looks  
 after Dick, searches for historical   
 books, and gardens.
