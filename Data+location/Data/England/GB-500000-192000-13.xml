		<title>13Public Transport</title>
		<content>  Public Transport is very important to
 people who do not have private        
 transport,either to go to work or just
 to go shopping.There are only two bus 
 services that actually stop in Maple  
 Cross,the Green Line and the W4.The   
 Green Line may cease to run through   
 Maple Cross soon,it may go along the  
 new M25 instead,this would be a faster
 way to travel.                        
  The buses in Maple Cross are not very
 widely used because most people own a 
 private vehicle.                      
  In Maple Cross there is an idustrial 
 estate which is the only one in our   
 'D' block.                            
  In our 'D' block there are only five 
 squares with bus services, most of    
 which run through the Maple Cross     
 squares.Apart from having few bus     
 services Maple Cross does not have    
 a train service either.               </content>
