<title>22Changing Times in Kimpton</title>
<content>

Since 1986 the following changes have happened:&lt;br />&lt;br />Probyn House is due to close to be replaced by houses suitable for the elderly.&lt;br />&lt;br />There is only one shop which includes a Post Office. The garage has been replaced by Wheelrights, a row of terraced houses in keeping with the Victorian terrace opposite.&lt;br />&lt;br />An additional sports area for cricket, tennis and netball has been developed behind parkfield Crescent.&lt;br />&lt;br />In 2001 the flooding problem became a reality when springs near Luton Airport sent water down the valley into the village via Claggy Road into the High Street. Houses were flooded for months.   &lt;br />
