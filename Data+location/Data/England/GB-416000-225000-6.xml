		<content> Fresh{trout}is advertised on several  
 roads leading to Donnington Trout     
 Farm. The farm was established 6 or 7 
 years ago because there was a{spring  
 providing plenty of fresh water at a  
 constant temperature. There are       
 millions of trout varying in size and 
 age. Some are sold at 3 months to be  
 brought on at another trout farm. When
 they are larger, over 8 ounces up to  
 several pounds in weight they are sold
 for{eating.}They are electrocuted in a
 special bath.{Anglers}can pay to spend
 the day fishing for trout in the lake 
 below the farm and are allowed up to 5
 fish a day. The fish are fed on       
 pellets of dried fish protein. Current
 prices are Â£1.25 a pound whole or     
 Â£1.35 a pound gutted.
