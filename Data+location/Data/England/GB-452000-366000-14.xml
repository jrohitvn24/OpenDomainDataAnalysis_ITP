  I went out after I helped my mum wash
 the dinner pots. I had a game of      
 football until tea-time. After tea,   
 mum and dad were working out the plans
 for the new kitchen. Our new kitchen  
 cupboards are going to be in pine. My 
 dad is going to buy my mum what they  
 call a split-level cooker.            
  I can't wait to move into our new    
 house.

  On first meeting children in         
 Shirebrook ,visitors could gain the   
 impression that they are tough,hard   
 and self-sufficient.Although partly   
 true,they are also generous,warm -    
 hearted and unsophisticated.
