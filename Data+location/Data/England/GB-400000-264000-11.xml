		<title>11HEADLESS CROSS AREA REDDITCH</title>
		<content>{Redditch}is a new town, but the area  
 called{Headless Cross}is in the       
 original part of Redditch. This       
 difference between old and new is best
 shown by the water towers. The new    
 tower is very tall and modern and can 
 be seen for miles, but also in our    
 area is the old water tower built many
 years ago. There are lots of new homes
 being built, but there are plenty of  
 spaces. Morton Stanley Park is very   
 large with many walks, most suitable  
 for taking dogs. There is also a play 
 area and a pond. We have two golf     
 courses in our area which adds to the 
 open space. There are a number of     
 shops and a regular bus service into  
 the town centre.                      
{Headless Cross}has all the advantages 
 of being close by the town centre     
 whilst still being a countryside      
 district.                             </content>
