		<content> FIVE FARMERS ARE ENGAGED IN           
 CULTIVATING LAND IN THIS AREA. EACH   
 HAS A STRIP  OF FIELDS RUNNING NORTH  
 WEST TO SOUTH EAST ACROSS IT.THE      
 DIVISION OF THE LAND WAS ORIGINALLY   
 MADE SO THAT EACH FARMER RECEIVED SOME
 OF THE BETTER SOIL IN THE VALLEY AS   
 WELL AS A SHARE OF THE THINNER CHALKY 
 SOIL OF THE DOWNS. THIS STILL APPLIES 
 TODAY. MIXED FARMING IS PRACTISED BY  
 ALL FIVE FARMERS. THE FIELDS ARE USED 
 IN ROTATION FOR CROPS OF WHEAT        
 BARLEY AND OATS AS WELL AS FOR SILAGE 
 AND GRAZING LAND FOR SHEEP AND CATTLE.
 SOME FEW AREAS ARE DIFFICULT BY REASON
 OF THEIR STEEP NATURE SO CANNOT BE    
 PLOUGHED. THESE ARE SOMETIMES         
 PERMANENT PASTURE OR SOMETIMES ROUGH  
 UNCULTIVATED GRASSLAND.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
