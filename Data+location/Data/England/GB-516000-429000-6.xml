 Within Holderness as a whole there are
 16 359 households and with Preston    
 there are about 700 houses, of this   
 number approximately 490 are privately
 owned and about 210 are rented either 
 from the council or from private      
 individuals.                          
 The housing types are a complete      
 mixture ranging from farmhouses dating
 from the 18th Centure to modern 2     
 bedroomed bungalows.                  
 A proportion of the post-war council  
 houses are asbestos clad and were     
 constructed using quick               
 non-traditional methods.              
 The oldest house in our area dates    
 back to the 1680's
