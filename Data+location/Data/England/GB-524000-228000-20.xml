		<title>20SCHOOLBOY LIFE IN 1985.</title>
		<content> At 10.30 the bell rings and if the    
 weather is fine we all go outside for 
 fifteen minutes play. I often play    
{football.}Work continues till         
 lunchtime 12.00. We eat lunch at      
 School either bringing our own        
 sandwiches or having a{school prepared
{meal.}In the afternoon, which starts  
 at 13.15 we work on project studies or
 have music, art, games and more       
 practical work. We finish school at   
 15.15 and I have someone who takes me 
 from school to her house. She has     
 children of her who are 6 and 8.      
 Every Thursday after school I go to   
 the village hall for Junior Church and
 afterwards I go to tea with my        
{child-minder.}My mother collects me at
 18.00 and we go home. Then I either   
 play with my friends, use my computer,
 watch television and have something to
 eat. I go to bed at 21.00.            </content>
