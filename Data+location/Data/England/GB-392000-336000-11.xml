		<title>11AGRICULTURE IN THE AREA</title>
		<content>There are numerous farms in our        
area,ranging in size from the small    
family farms such as Idlerock Farm at  
grid reference 933376 to the much      
larger farms like dale farm at grid    
reference 947384.The type of farming   
undertaken ranges widely with the land 
type,technology and investment.        
The smaller"homestead" farms in the    
area tend to specialise in dairy       
farming or on sheep.The larger more    
capitally intensive will also undertake
cereal growing.Cereals are grown either
for fodder or for sale.                
Besides these main types of farming,one
can also see examples of rape(this crop
has increased because of Common Market 
intervention prices and is used as an  
edible oil),potatoes and turnips.      
As a long term investment some         
landowners have kept areas of mixed    
woodland and pasture for horse grazing </content>
