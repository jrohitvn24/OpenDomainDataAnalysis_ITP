		<content> The stone font has a beautiful carved 
 wood cover made many years ago by a   
 local resident as were the 2 chairs   
 near the Communion table. There is a  
 carved arm chair for when the Bishop  
 visits, a carved lecrern and pulpit.  
 The organ, once hand pumped, now has  
 an electric blower. It is thought the 
 organ was installed about 1860. A     
 bell, hand pulled, is dedicated to 21 
 church wardens in 1728. On the north  
 wall hangs the records of patrons,    
 rectors and wardens. In 1626 the      
 patron was Charles I, the rector      
 Richard Burton. The Rectors' list     
 dates from 1303. Pewter and silver    
 Communion plates and chalices are kept
 in the church safe. One old grave     
 stone dated 1811 tells of "Happy Dick"
 who taught at the school for 49 years 
 and was Parish Clerk for 35 years. the
 churchyard was enlarged some years ago</content>
