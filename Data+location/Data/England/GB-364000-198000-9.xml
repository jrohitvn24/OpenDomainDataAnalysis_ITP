		<title>09BERKELEY POWER STATION (1)</title>
		<content> Berkeley was the{first commercial     
{nuclear power station}to be put into  
 operation, its electricity entering   
 the National Grid on{June 12 1962.}It 
 is positioned on the eastern shore of 
 the tidal Severn Estuary approximately
 midway between Gloucester and Bristol.
 It has two natural{uranium}fuelled,   
{carbon dioxide}gas-cooled,{graphite   
 moderated nuclear reactors heating    
 eight boilers which supply steam to   
 four dual steam pressure turbo        
 generators each of{83000kW}capacity.  
 The fuel elements number 42445 per    
 reactor and have an average life of   
 six years. The station's net output is
{275000kW.                             
 Recently the station was shut down due
 to{cracks in both reactors,}but now it
 is back to producing electricity,     
 and is expected to face another ten   
 years of operation.                   </content>
