		<content> The grass fields surrounding          
 Collingbourne Kingston are used by a  
 herd of milking cows which are milked 
 by a milking bale which is a mobile   
 milking parlour. The herd consists of 
 140_160 Freisian/Hereford cows with   
 a Simmental Bull. Two men milk these  
 cows twice a day. The milk is cooled  
 in a bulk tank in a dairy and the Milk
 Marketing Board collects it once a    
 day. This is then taken by road to    
 Kent where it is bottled for doorstep 
 delivery. The milking bale will move  
 around the farm during the year as    
 required following the cows which stay
 outside all year. The cows will eat   
 hay, silage, straw (treated with      
 caustic soda to make it more          
 palatable), kale, rolled oats, barley 
 and soya beans.
