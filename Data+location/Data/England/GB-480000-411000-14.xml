		<title>14Keadby Wharf</title>
		<content> Ships registered in Germany,Belgium,  
 Holland,Sweden,Denmark,Russia and     
 Spain come to the wharf,which is      
 privately owned,bringing materials    
 from a variety of places.65% of its   
 business is dealing with imports and  
 35% with exports.Imports include sand,
 timber,grain,anthracite,steel,pig iron
 and magnacite.Exports include grain   
 and finished steel.Imports are taken  
 by road to all parts of the country.  
 Being a small private wharf handling  
 costs are cheaper.Ships come up river 
 on the tide and drop anchor and allow 
 the tide to turn the ship into the    
 wharf.Three men work  at this wharf   
 which is a subsidiary for the larger  
 one across the river.Ships are        
 unloaded by bobcat into cranes which  
 can lift up to 50 tonnes.The men work 
 a 6 hour shift.There are 2 lay by     
 berths either side of the wharf.      </content>
