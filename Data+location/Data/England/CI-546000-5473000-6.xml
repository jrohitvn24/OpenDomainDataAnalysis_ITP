		<content> On Sark there are a wide variety of   
 jobs such as farming, fishing and     
 gardening. There is a quarry and 100  
 metres further down the harbour hill  
 is Maseline harbour, the most modern  
 of the two harbours. On the harbour's 
 quay tractors wait three times a week 
 in summer and twice in the winter for 
 the Sark Trader, carrying the island's
 supplies, from Guernsey. These include
 food, building supplies, newspapers,  
 the post and, when needed, cattle     
 food. These are brought up the hill by
 the carters, the local term for       
 delivery man. The two postmen who     
 deliver and sort the mail,and the     
 telephone exchange enginer are all    
 payed from the Guernsey.Three teachers
 are employed, one infant, one junior  
 and one senior who doubles as head.
