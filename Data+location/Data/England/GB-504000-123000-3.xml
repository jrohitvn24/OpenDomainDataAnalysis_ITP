		<title>03THE BELLS,WISBOROUGH GREEN</title>
		<content> The church of St.Peter ad Vincula has 
 a ring of six bells.  The third,      
 fourth and fifth were originally cast 
 in 1656.  The tenor was cast in 1669  
 by William Eldridge, probably at a    
 foundry in Horsham.  In 1928 the      
 fourth was recast by Taylors of Lough 
 borough and the ring was made up to   
 six by the addition of the treble and 
 second, cast at the same foundry in   
 1928.  The ring ws re-tuned and the   
 wooden bell-frame was replaced by a   
 steel frame.  Steel headstocks        
 replaced the original wooden ones in  
 1973.  The bells are rung before      
 Morning Service on Sundays, for       
 weddings and on special occasions.    
 West Sussex Ringers rang a Quarterpeal
 of plain doubles on April 20th,1985 - 
 1026 changes.  A peal of The Tower    
 Method Wisborough Green Place Doubles 
 will be rung during 1985.             </content>
