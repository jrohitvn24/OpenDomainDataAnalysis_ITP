		<content> In our area there is a wide variety of
 trade ranging from a post office which
 sells newspapers and groceries,a      
 wholesale butchers,a general store,a  
 grocery shop and a saddlers,which is  
 owned by a master saddler,a rare craft
 these days.There is also a sawmill,a  
 drainage contractor and mobile vans,  
 selling groceries,fish and chips,and  
 icecream.A taxidermist,woodcarver and 
 potter have workshops and the only    
 garage sells petrol,sweets and car and
 bicycle accessories.The wholesale     
 butchers was established in 1897 as a 
 butchers shop,but now includes an     
 abbatoir. Other amenities available   
 locally are a hairdresser,mobile      
 library,picture framer,plumber and    
 electrician.Although it is possible to
 buy almost anything in the village the
 prices tend to be higher than those of
 the large stores in the nearby towns. </content>
