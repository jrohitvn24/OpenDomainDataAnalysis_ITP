		<content>    Shifnal's schools began as one all 
 age church school in the late 17th    
 century.This was demolished and a new 
 church school for juniors was built.A 
 new state school for infants, and a   
 secondary school for the older        
 children,who did not pass the         
 selection examination, was built in   
 the town.                             
    As the town population expanded;due
 a good rail service and its           
 geographical position, the church     
 junior school was expanded to include 
 infants and the state school was      
 expanded to take juniors.So there were
 now two primary schools at the        
 opposite ends the town ; each         
 catering for about four hundred       
 children, and a secondary school      
 containing over one thousand  pupils.
