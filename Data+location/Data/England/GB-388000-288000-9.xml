		<content> Until the end of the 1939-45 war the  
 area was mainly engaged in{mining,    
{quarrying, brick and tile making.     
 The centre of the area is the 250 acre
{Industrial Estate.}This was once a    
 number of small coal pits, but now it 
 contains over 100 units, some quite   
 small, employing only a few people.   
 Some firms make parts for vehicles and
 metal fasteners, others are storage   
 for beer, cider, steel bars, furniture
 and joinery. There are{Trading Estates
 at Dawley Brook and The Wallows. There
 are several old brick works in the    
 area but these are now mainly used for
 storing bricks manufactured elsewhere.
 Although just outside our area, the   
 Round Oak steel works employed many   
 people from this area until it was    
 closed three years ago. Only a few of 
 the unemployed found employment on    
 Trading Estates.                      </content>
