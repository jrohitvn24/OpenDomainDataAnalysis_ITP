		<title>09SMALLFIELD VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{ Smallfield village}is an example of  
 Victorian linear development. This has
 been broadened by housing estates     
 built during the last 30 years.       
 Smallfield has retained its village   
 identity despite being almost a suburb
 of Horley. The village centre has a   
 Post Office, Church hall and a few    
 shops. There are infrequent bus       
 services to Horley, Crawley and East  
 Grinstead. The name "Smallfield" is   
 thought to be derived from the "Small 
 Field" once part of the Common        
 extending east towards Horne. The     
 school now stands on the "Small Field"
 which was eventually enclosed and     
 farmed for hay. Being in the lowest   
 lying part of the area and liable to  
 flooding, only one hay crop a year    
 could be grown. The village Church    
 lies 1 mile south in the hamlet of    
 Burstow.                              </content>
