Century Parish Church fell into        
disrepair in the time of Cromwell.Since
then only the Sanctuary and Eastern    
part of the nave have been used for    
weekly worship by the lively Christain 
congregation.In October 1983 The Church
Council decided that it was essential  
for the livelihood and growth of the   
church,and for the well being of       
villagers and visitors that the church 
provide for basic ameneties and        
hospitality.An appeal was then launched
for $25,000 for building with-in the   
ruined nave walls,the new building to  
be known as a Narthex.The Narthex to   
include toilet,kitchen,meeting room,   
choir vestry,clergy vestry sales kisok 
and storage.It was opened in November  
1985.
