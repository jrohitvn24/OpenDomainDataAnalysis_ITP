 others in our area.He started with 100
 acres and now has 500.He grows soft   
 fruits,cereals,potatoes,sugar beet and
 runner beans, he also keeps battery   
 hens but he mainly keeps cows.He buys 
 Hereford Fresian cows at 7 months     
 weighing 700lb.The vet checks them and
 gives them a growth pellet in their   
 ear to improve the quality of the     
 meat.The cows graze until late Autumn,
 in Winter they  are kept in a hugh    
 barn, they are fed on food that are   
 grown on the farm.In Spring the cows  
 are turned out to graze.They are      
 fattened and sold  at{Kidderminster   
{Market}when they weigh 1100lb.Mr Jones
 buys more calves and starts again.
