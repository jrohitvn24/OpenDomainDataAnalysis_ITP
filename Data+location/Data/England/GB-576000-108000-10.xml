		<title>10Tourism in St.Leonard's</title>
		<content> A coastal resort,St.Leonard's has a   
 seasonal influx of Summer visitors.   
 Guest houses and holiday flats abound 
 and there are 2 main holiday centres. 
 The smaller,Hastings Holiday Centre,  
 offers full-board accommodation for   
 around Â£80 per week.At the other,Combe
 Haven,almost 500 caravans and a       
 smaller number of bungalows,chalets   
 and villas are let for between Â£151   
 and Â£248 per week (self-catering).286 
 more caravans are privately owned.The 
 site boasts a range of entertainments 
 and recreational facilities.Many come 
 just for these,but others visit       
 annually because of the attraction of 
 the surrounding area.While            
 St.Leonard's may offer relatively     
 little to the holidaymaker,Brighton,  
 Eastbourne,Rye and the Sussex         
 countryside are easily reached.Many   
 foreign students also visit.          </content>
