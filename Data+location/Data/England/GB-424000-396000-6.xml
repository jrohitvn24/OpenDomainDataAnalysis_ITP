		<content>  MANY PEOPLE VISIT THE NEARBY VILLAGE 
 OF BOLSTERSTONE TO SEE THE OLD        
 BUILDINGS AND THE COUNTRYSIDE NEARBY. 
 ONE OLD BUILDING IS CALLED THE        
 PORTER'S LODGE, WHICH IS SAID TO BE   
 PART OF THE REMAINS OF A CASTLE BUILT 
 IN THE 13TH CENTURY.  PEOPLE SAY THAT 
 THE WALLS OF THE FIELDS LEADING TO THE
 ROCKS WERE THOUGHT TO BE PART OF THE  
 CASTLE REMAINS.                       
   TO THE NORTHEAST IS WALDERS LOW,    
 WHICH IS SAID TO BE THE BURIAL SITE OF
 A SAXON CHIEF CALLED WALDER.          
   EWDEN VALLEY TO THE SOUTH OF THE    
 VILLAGE IS THOUGHT TO BE CALLED AFTER 
 THE EWE TREES THAT GROW THERE, OR     
 POSSIBLY THE "DEN" OR VALLEY   OF A   
 SAXON CHIEF CALLED YEW.               
   IN STOCKSBRIDGE AND BOLSTERSTONE    
 THERE ARE PUBLIC FOOTPATHS FOR        
 EXPLORING THE COUNTRYSIDE.
