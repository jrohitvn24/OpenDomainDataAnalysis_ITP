		<title>07Mr. Morrell's Day.</title>
		<content>   A typical day for the vicar starts  
 at 9 a.m. when he prepares for the    
 weekly school assembly. This is       
 followed by prayers for 30 mins. From 
 10 a.m. to 10.45 is Holy Commumnion.  
 Straight afterwards he has school     
 assembly and then he teaches the 4th  
 year of Shedfield School where he is  
 also Chairman of the School Governors.
 At noon he stays in his office until  
 about 1 p.m. when he has lunch. After 
 this he has meetings and travels      
 around in his car to visit different  
 people. Then from 5 to 5.30 p.m. he   
 has prayers in Church. After this he  
 spends an hour with his family. Before
 going to bed he visits children who   
 are going to be baptised. His happy   
 moments are at weddings and baptisms  
 and his sad moments are at funerals,  
 especially when children are involved.
