		<content>    We went to{Bellister Castle.} We   
 saw the very old part of the castle   
 which is a ruin.  The walls were made 
 of round stones from the river and    
 square stones that could have come    
 from the Roman Wall.  We measured the 
 walls.  They were 1 metre 56          
 centimetres thick.                    
    The castle was built about 700     
 years ago by Robert de Ros as a       
 protection against the Scots who used 
 to come over the border to steal      
 cattle and to fight the English       
 farmers.                              
    There is supposed to be a{secret   
{passage}to the church and the Red Lion
 (an old pele tower) in Haltwhistle.   
    We saw an old stone that said      
{"JB1667"}when the castle was enlarged 
 by John Blenkinsopp for his son.
