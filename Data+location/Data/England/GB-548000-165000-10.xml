		<title>10A working farm 1.Wested</title>
		<content> Wested farm is typical of a farm in   
 Crockenhill.Today it is a 800 acre    
 farm producing barley and durum       
 wheat.When the farm was started in    
 1908 it produced fruit and market     
 garden crops and covered some         
 400acres.At certain times hops were   
 grown and these were brought by local 
 breweries.The market gardening was    
 stopped in 1977 due to the long dry   
 summer and the fluctuating price of   
 vegetables.The growing of cereals has 
 meant the enlarging of fields and     
 destruction of hedgerows and woods.The
 farm today employs 1 full time and 1  
 part time,in the past it employed up  
 to 30 people and more at harvest      
 time.The farmer does not practice     
 rotation but uses large quantities of 
 chemical fertilisers.The planting is  
 carried out in autumn and the         
 harvesting between July and September.</content>
