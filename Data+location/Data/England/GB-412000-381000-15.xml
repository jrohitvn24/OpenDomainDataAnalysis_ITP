		<content> We have a Parish council of 7 members 
 ,elected every 4 years,the next       
 election being in 1987.It is the      
 village form of local goverment .This 
 Council looks after the provision of  
 seats in the village,bins for litter  
 in the streets,looks at planning      
 applications for new buildings in the 
 village and passes on sugestions  and 
 complaints to the next higher up      
 council ,the borough of the High      
 Peak at Buxton.                       
 In our 1984 local Council surveyed    
 roads and street lighting with a view 
 to improving it.Mostly its problems   
 have to do with litter and with       
 peoples planning aplications.The      
 Chairman thinks that Castleton will   
 not alter much in the next 10 years   
 except for the extension at Midland   
 Ross Electronics factory which is to  
 engage 200 new workers soon.          </content>
