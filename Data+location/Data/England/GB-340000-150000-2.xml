		<content> Field sizes in the district around    
 Weare tend to be dictated by drainage 
 rhynes and new housing by drainage and
 sewage related problems. The houses   
 are occupied by managerial personnel  
 involved in finance, selling and      
 technical industries. Many elderly    
 people retire to the area but few of  
 the native stock can afford to buy    
 property. Very few residents earn     
 their living in the area. Most people 
 are car owners and travel considerable
 distances to work.                    
 One "B" road straddles the area with  
 minor roads linking to it and tracks  
 and droves provide access to farms.   
 Pavements rarely exist and road       
 lighting is nil. Public transport is  
 non existent and most entertainment is
 in the larger towns within a 25 mile  
 radius.Local societies and groups do  
 exist mainly in Weare and Allerton.   </content>
