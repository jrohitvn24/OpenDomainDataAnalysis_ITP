		<content>    The{National Trust}bought{Fountains
{Abbey}and{Studley Royal Park}in 1983. 
 They bought it off the{North Yorkshire
{County Council}for Â£191,144  because  
 the County Council was not able to    
 provide the necessary money for the   
 upkeep.The National Trust's aim is to 
 restore the park to the way it was in 
 the days when the{Aislabie family     
 owned it.They created what is arguably
 the most spectacular water garden in  
 England between 1716 and 1781.        
 The property ,little altered in       
 the late 18th and 19th centuries ,was 
 preserved by the Vyner family.It was  
 transfered to the{North Yorkshire     
{County Council}in 1974 from the{West  
{Riding County Council. }              
    Unfortunately,in recent years the  
 property has fallen into disrepair.The
 National Trust are determined to      
 return the park to its former glory.  </content>
