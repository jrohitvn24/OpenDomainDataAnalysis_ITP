		<content>{For one farmer's wife day begins 7am, 
 earlier in busy times. Prepare        
 breakfast. Put washing in, 2-3 loads  
 daily. Get girls up for work. Feed    
 horses and poultry, sometimes calves. 
 Breakfast over, household chores -    
 fires in winter (no central heating). 
 May have to help outside: move cattle,
 sort potatoes, go for tractor spares  
 or livestock feed. Extra baking in    
 busy times to send into fields, or one
 or more men for lunch 12.30 prompt.   
 Once a week find time for farm        
 accounts and VAT returns. Many phone  
 calls for family as well as farm;     
 interruptions from company reps and   
 deliveries, often involving search for
 menfolk. Christmas extra is turkey    
 dressing: men pluck, I dress 75-100   
 birds.{Usually relax 8-8.30.}All in   
 all very busy; sometimes frustrated   
 but love it all, especially my horses.</content>
