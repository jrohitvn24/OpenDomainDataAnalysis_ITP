		<content>    A local village well loved person  
 Aunt Kate as she is known by all young
 and old alike came to the village 45  
 years ago during the War.  There was  
 only a few houses in the main street, 
 2 pubs and 2 shops. A butchers shop   
 was a mile away and she had to walk   
 everywhere.  There were no buses,no   
 telephones and no electricity.  She   
 says that people are more friendlier  
 and helpful than when she first came. 
 She is 85 years old but in the past   
 years has nursed families in          
 confinement and laid out the dead.
