		<content>  Two narrow, unlit, twisty roads run  
 south through Woodeaton and Elsfield  
 respectively. There are no footpaths  
 by the side of these roads.There is no
 public transport , so the use of a car
 or motor_bike or cycle is vital.It is 
 nearly 4 miles to the nearest shops.  
  Oxford is the nearest point for      
 contact with rail services and for    
 coach travel.                         
  A school bus collects the children in
 the morning and takes them to schools 
 in Beckley, Wheatley and Kidlington. A
 few children go to Independent        
 schools in Oxford.                    
  Women meet monthly in each other's   
 homes, and some belong to the Women's 
 Institute at Islip. Some villagers go 
 to the Young Farmers Club at Islip. A 
 few people find work on farms in the  
 area, but most work in Oxford.
