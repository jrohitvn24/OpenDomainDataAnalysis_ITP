		<title>15THE OLD DAYS IN HIGHWOOD</title>
		<content> I lived in this area when I was a     
 boy.My father was the blacksmith and  
 my uncle was the wheelwright.I think  
 that the area changed unbelievably in 
 60 years.                             
 When I was a boy{most people lived    
{and worked in the area.}They hardly   
 ever went anywhere.Now 2 men and ma-  
 chines do the work of 20 men.Every-   
 thing on farms was{done by hand}and   
 there were some part-time jobs.       
{School}has changed so much.There was  
 no school bus,no school dinners,no    
 playing field and no secondary school.
 Discipline was strict and the cane was
 often used.Looking back I don't mind  
 this discipline at school because we  
 had laughs though life was harder.    
{Roads}were made of cobbles and ballast
 They were very muddy in wet weather.  
 People used to walk long distances.   
 They were the{best days}of my life.   </content>
