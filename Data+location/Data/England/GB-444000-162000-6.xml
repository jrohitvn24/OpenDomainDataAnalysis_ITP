		<content> It is Wednesday so we go straight to a
 double English lesson. I walk in still
 holding my tennis raquet, so I  have  
 to rush down and put it in the        
 changing rooms.  Next we have cookery.
 I spend break washing up.  I have all 
 the ingredients this time but I have  
 just got it into the oven when it is  
 time for my piano lesson.  I have     
 actually practised and she is very    
 pleased and says I could do Grade 1 at
 Easter.  Next we have French; Madame  
 Walker writes the vocabulary so fast  
 on the blackboard that I haven't      
 finished the first lot when she rubs  
 it off and starts thr second. Then we 
 have Classical Studies with Mrs Gay.  
 We are doing "An Athenian Woman's     
 Wedding" and she dictates notes so    
 fast our arms nearly fall off trying  
 to catch up with her! PTO
