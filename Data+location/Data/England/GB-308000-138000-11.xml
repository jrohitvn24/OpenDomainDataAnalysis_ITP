		<title>11Torweston Farm</title>
		<content>     The farm is a old one.It was built
 on the foundations of an{Elizabethan  
{castle.}The present farmhouse was     
 built one hundred years ago in the    
 Victorian times.The Victorians did    
 many things.Once they built a{water   
{wheel}which could power the whole     
 farm.It ran on two pools.The water    
 went though under ground channels     
 leading to the wheel.                 
    The owners of the farm are Mr and  
 Mrs Richards.They own at the most     
 twenty fields.Their boundary is the   
 railway track.Some fields have names  
 like the Great Big Field.             
    At the farm they have an old {lime 
{kiln}which they used to put lime in   
 and burn it. Then it would be taken   
 to the fields and spread  on the acid 
 soil like fertilizer.
