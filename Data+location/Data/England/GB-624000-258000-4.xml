		<content> Many species of wild flowers grow     
along the verges,the most common being 
sheep's parsley,primroses,cowslips,dog 
roses &amp; blackthorn.There are not many  
trees because the land is so productive
agriculturally.Many elms have died from
Dutch Elm disease,hedges have been     
grubbed out making the fields large and
prairie-like.                          
 Footpaths are well signposted and in  
places cross farm crops, but they are  
not walked often enough to keep them   
"open".Conservation of these,and of    
wild flowers,are of interest to local  
groups and much is done to preserve    
them.                                  
 In this area of East Anglia rainfall  
is light,often with a dry Spring,which 
brings many problems as the heavy soil 
compacts and caps.Water is sometimes   
rationed during the summer.
