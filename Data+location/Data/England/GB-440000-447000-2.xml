		<title>02WETHERBY DOMESDAY PROJECT</title>
		<content>   The two Domesday Blocks for Wetherby
 were surveyed during the summer term  
 of 1985 by local schools. Although the
{High School}coordinated the work it   
 was very much a joint venture.{St.    
{James Primary School}were the first to
 start, they concentrated on the area  
 East of the old A1 (North Street)     
 counting amenities and visiting       
 companies on the industrial estate.   
{Crossley Street Primary School        
 surveyed the town to the West of the  
 old A1, visiting the Market and       
 Council offices. The High School used 
 sixth form students to survey the     
 rural areas to the East and West and  
 to investigate various local issues.  
{Sicklinghall School}provided the      
 page on their village hall.           
   One of the major benefits of the    
 project has been to enable the schools
 to work more closely with each other. </content>
