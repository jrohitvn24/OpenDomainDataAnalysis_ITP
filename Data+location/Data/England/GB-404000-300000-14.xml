		<title>14   Industry in Aldridge</title>
		<content> The past industrial development of the
 area has been associated with the     
 exploitation of minerals. With the    
 using up of the richer coal seams in  
 about 1900, coal and iron industries  
 ceased to be of major importance.     
 Limestone working was discontinued in 
 the 1930's. At Stubbers Green Aldridge
 however Brick and Tile manufacture    
 remains an important industry. Around 
 Linley Wood and Stubbers Green large  
 areas of deeply scarred waste land    
 give evidence of the towns past. From 
 the 1950's onwards industrial estates 
 have developed bringing precision     
 engineering, plastics and machine     
 tools into the area. The most recent  
 development has been a large factory  
 estate built between Northgate and    
 Stubbers Green. This is made up mainly
 of service industries and warehousing 
 and distribution facilities.          </content>
