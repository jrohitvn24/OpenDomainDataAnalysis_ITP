		<title>08Verwood: the New School.</title>
		<content>    After the Summer Holiday,in        
 September 1985 ,Verwood C.E. First    
 School will move into its new building
 in Howe Lane.The new school has six   
 class areas,three practical areas,a   
 hall and administrative offices.It is 
 designed to take 180 children to begin
 with but could be extended to take up 
 to 300 should the need arise.         
    The school will eventually share   
 the site with a Youth Centre and the  
 proposed new Middle School.When the   
 latter will be built is not yet known.
 Local people want the school but would
 prefer it not to be a church school   
 but the local authority would like the
 church to assist in funding it! Time  
 alone will tell!                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
