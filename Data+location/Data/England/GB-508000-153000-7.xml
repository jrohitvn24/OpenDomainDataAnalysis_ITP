   Although only a small depot it      
 handles{67000 pints}weekly.The manager
 was sent there by Unigate 13 years    
 ago.The{number of staff}was 23 now it 
 is{19}.Milk consumption has gone down 
 considerably as young children now    
 prefer fizzy pop.Another reason for   
 its decline is that the government has
 cut the third of a pint at schools.The
 manager said that although the        
 distribution depot has changed the    
 actual village has not.At first the   
 milkman only used to take out milk on 
 his float but now he sells potatoes,  
 fruit juice,bread and cream etc.Their 
 rounds stretch to Ranmore,Fetcham and 
 Clandon.The milkmen arrive for work at
 5am and finish at 1pm.When the floats 
 return to the depot they are recharged
 for 6_7 hours as the floats run on    
 electricity.                          </content>
