   South Weald is a small village{2km} 
 W.of Brentwood.There is very little   
 developement in South Weald as it is  
 part of the{Green Belt}.It has one    
 Church of England primary school and a
 Church called St.Peters.The main      
 attraction is the country park.The    
 surrounding land is mostly farmland   
 and deciduous trees.There are no shops
 but one Public House-The Tower Arms-  
 opposite the Church.                  
                                       
   Although Weald is only small the    
 primary school has about{300}pupils   
 and children from Brentwood travel    
 there by bus.Part of South Weald's    
 buildings include the 10 alms houses  
 that date from 1870.These are for the 
 elderly.Since 1966 two new ones have  
 been built.
