		<content> The area east of the housing estates  
 is a site of major historical intrest.
 Over the last 20 years the Fengate    
 site has been heavily investigated. A 
 large number of finds and a wealth of 
 evidence has been gathered on the     
 period between Neolithic Times and the
 Middle Ages.However the whole site has
 now been bulldozed for industrial     
 development.                          
 During this yeara new important site  
 has been discovered on Flag Fen.It    
 istoo soon to know what has really    
 been found except that it appears to  
 be a Bronze Age site.Further work is  
 continuing although this has been     
 hampered by attacks from vandals .
