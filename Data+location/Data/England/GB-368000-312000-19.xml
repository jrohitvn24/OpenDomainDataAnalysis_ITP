		<title>19PLAYSCHEME,TRENCH, TELFORD.</title>
		<content> The Playscheme was set up to provide  
 after-school activities for local     
 children aged 5 - 12.It is now based  
 in an empty classroom at Teagues      
 Bridge Junior School.On fine days they
 also use the playground.The scheme is 
 run by Mrs.Pearson and a team of      
 volunteers.It is funded by grants from
 Wrekin District Council and Telford   
 Development Corporation. A pool table 
 was given by another club which closed
 down.The money provides for games and 
 equipment such as snooker and table   
 tennis tables,footballs.The scheme    
 runs from 3.15 - 5.00p.m. on Tuesdays 
 during term-time.Children can buy     
 drinks and crisps there.There are now 
 60 children attending regularly and   
 they can choose from a wide range of  
 activities.No - one has ever been     
 banned from the scheme and there is no
 vandalism!                            </content>
