		<content>   This is a flattish area with few    
physical features.   In the north there
is a small conifer-covered hill        
named,rather surprisingly "Alder       
Coppice".   The southern part of the   
block includes some of a narrow ridge  
called "Abbot's Castle Hill" which     
although not very high is the most     
prominent feature of the district and  
provides a very good vantage point.    
   Levels in the area  vary between    
eighty and one hundred and forty       
metres above sea level.                
   There is practically no visible     
water.   No river or broad  stream     
flows through the area and there are no
lakes, resevoirs or canals.   One small
pond in the south-west corner is the   
only noticeable stretch of water.
