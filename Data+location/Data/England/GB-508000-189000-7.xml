		<content> My Father is a member of the Crusaders
 Golfing Society.Most of its members   
 come from the Northwood area.They like
 playing on different golf courses and 
 amongst these are Haste Hill,Moor Park
 and Aldenham.They often play          
 competitions for trophies of which my 
 Father has won three.                 
 We are lucky living on Haste Hill     
 because there is a golf course        
 practically behind our house.Whenever 
 my Father gets the chance he goes out 
 and practices there,especially if     
 there is a competition coming up.     
 He usually goes golfing during the    
 summer months as it is still light    
 when he gets home from work.          
 Unlike Moor Park and Aldenham,Haste   
 Hill golf course is not actually      
 floodlit.Even so it is often very     
 crowded as many people use it.It is a 
 very good golf course.                </content>
