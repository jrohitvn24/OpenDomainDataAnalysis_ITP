		<content> Looking down from Shutter Point in the
 S.W.you see Great Shutter Rock which, 
 according to folklore,would nicely    
 stopper the nearby Devil's Limekiln.  
 This is a natural funnel-shaped       
 feature which is 76 metres wide at the
 top and which plunges ,almost         
 vertically,for 91 metres to sea level.
 Further east is Seal's Hole-a large   
 sea cave where seals are supposed to  
 breed.                                
 On the Windward coast,north of Shutter
 Point,are the Montagu Steps;these were
 built during the attempted salvage of 
 the first-class battleship Montagu    
 after she foundered here in May 1906. 
 A little further north again is       
 Pilot's Quay.This is no longer used   
 due to a landslip in 1911.During      
 most of the 1800's pilots were        
 required in the Bristol Channel and   
 were picked up here during E.winds.   </content>
