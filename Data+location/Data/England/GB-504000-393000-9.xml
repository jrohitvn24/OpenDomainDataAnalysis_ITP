		<title>09FARMING OWERSBY GENERAL</title>
		<content> This block is within an area of highly
 intensive farming,both livestock and  
 arable.The main crops are barley,wheat
 oil seed rape and potatoes with some  
 sugar beet and peas,and even an exper-
 imental crop of approx.12 acres of lu-
 pins has been tried this year.Many of 
 the arable fields have been enlarged  
 over the years to make way for the mas
 -sive machinery in use on some of the 
 farms.A wide variety of livestock is  
 kept;sheep,beef cattle,poultry for    
 eggs,pigs for bacon and Anglo-Nubian  
 goats,some of which are exported to   
 improve the breeding stock abroad.Yet 
 there is still room for nostalgia with
 one farmer breeding shire horses as a 
 sideline and keeping them partly on   
 old meadow still with its pattern of  
 rig and furrow evident.Quite a contr- 
 ast to a 50 H.P.tractor in a field    
 of more than 200 acres.(80 hectares)  </content>
