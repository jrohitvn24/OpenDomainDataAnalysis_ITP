		<content>Machinery is obviously very useful to  
any farm.You don't do as much work     
because machines can move things like  
hay more quickly.Hyde Farm has seven   
tractors,a combine harvester and corn  
drills.To dry the corn they take       
trailer loads of corn and tip them     
onto the floor of a room.Air blows     
through the floor and it dries faster  
than usual.Hyde Farm is on a 2000 acre 
estate half of which is woodland and   
half of which is farmland.The farm is  
on one of the three gravel beds in the 
chilterns.The ground here  is not very 
good,but you can grow crops.The poor   
so
