		<title>08History Of Winchmore Hill.</title>
		<content> This is a description of the history  
 of Winchmore Hill taken from an       
 interview with a lady who has lived   
 there for sixty five years.           
  A great deal of modernisation has    
 taken place including the laying of an
 electricity supply and water mains.The
 local public house has trebled in size
 whilst old cottages have been         
 preserved.The local church and Penn   
 Street were built from local stone    
 which was collected from the common by
 local women.All new houses built must 
 have a gable and any extentions must  
 be undertaken so as to leave          
 the original appearance of the house  
 unaltered.Any new walls must contain  
 flint taken from the old wall so as to
 retain the period appearance.         
  The local pond was dug to provide    
 clay for pottery.It was filled in when
 a boy died in a skating accident.     </content>
