		<content> Interview from Mr.Lawrence            
 by Claire Drewery and Helen Yates.    
 About 50 years ago from Willerby Road 
 to Carr lane was a very big farm.Then 
 in 1930 it was made into a golf course
 and the old farmhouse was changed into
 the club house.At the same time a     
 bowling club was built,a pavillion    
 with two greens in front of it.The    
 park area and some tennis courts.     
  The prices to go on the tennis courts
 or bowling greens are:                
 BOWLS adults - 23p half hour.         
     children - 12p half hour.         
 TENNIS       - 22p half hour.         
  The greatest difficulty of being a   
 groundsman is floods with rain,ice and
 snow,no work can be done then.        
  There is no age limit so anyone can  
 play bowls.It is not a private        
 club,anyone can go there.
