		<content>   The farms in the area have managed  
to maintain their identities with their
field layout unchanged for centuries.  
Manufactured fertilizers brought major 
changes to the modified 3-field system 
used over the years.                   
   Less reliant on natural fertilizers 
the less profitable dairy herd and     
other livestock were the first to go   
and the land was turned over to more   
marketable produce - vegetables and    
grain.    Much of this produce was     
directed at the large food factories   
in Wigan and on Merseyside. In         
addition the E.E.C. and Government     
Subsidies changed trends and new crops 
have been introduced e.g. sugar beet   
and rape seed.    The only animal      
stock now to be seen are cattle being  
fattened up for the meat market.       
   Thus the farmers have made their    
farms very efficient and profitable.   </content>
