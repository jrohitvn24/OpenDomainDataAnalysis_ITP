		<title>19THE GROWING UP OF LONGTON</title>
		<content>    A piece of prose written in memory 
 of a childhood in Longton before the  
 planners from South Ribble Council    
 took over the area from Preston Rural 
 District Council.                     
                                       
   They have taken away my playgrounds.
   They have destroyed all the wild    
 places.                               
   The streams have been piped or      
 covered.                              
   The woodland is now a car park.     
   The Brick Croft is bare and         
 flattened,                            
   The footpaths all paved and quite   
 clean.                                
   There are no weeds in the parkland  
   And no horses allowed on the Rec.   
   Where are the children to play NOW? 
   Perhaps everyone has grown old.     
                                       
                                       </content>
