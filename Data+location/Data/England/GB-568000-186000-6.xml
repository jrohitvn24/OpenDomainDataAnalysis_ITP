 A NEW TOWN IS ONE IN WHICH IN ESSENCE 
 HAS BEEN PLANNED AND NOT ALLOWED TO   
 DEVELOP HAPHAZARDLY. THE OBJECTIVE WAS
 TO PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH NOT ONLY A   
 HOME BUT ALSO A PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT,  
 AND AMENITIES FOR EDUCATION AND       
 RECREATION.                           
 THE BOUNDARIES OF THE NEW TOWN WERE   
 DRAWN UP IN 1949, AND THE FIRST HOUSE 
 WERE COMPLETED IN 1951. THE TOWN WAS  
 BUILT IN 'LOCAL NEIGHBOURHOODS, WHICH 
 WAS A SELFCONTAINED UNIT, WITH SHOPS, 
 SCHOOL, PUBLIC HOUSE, COMMUNITY HALL, 
 CHURCH ETC.                           
 ORIGINALLY, NINE SUCH NEIGHBOURHOODS  
 WERE PLANNED, BUT IT NOW SEEMS THAT   
 THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE ABOUT TWENTY.
