		<title>04A46:TRUNK ROAD</title>
		<content>    The A46 is the major road running  
 through Painswick, linking the village
 with Cheltenham to the north, and with
 Stroud to the south. There has been a 
 road running along the same route,    
 through the village since 1429. It    
 became an important routeway because  
 it connected the spa towns of Bath and
 Cheltenham,and so brought visitors and
 trade to Painswick. Today the A46 runs
 from Bath, beyond Cheltenham to       
 Evesham, Coventry, Lincoln, finishing 
 near to Grimsby.                      
     We conducted a traffic census on  
 the A46 for thirty minutes,to gain    
 some idea of the volume and variety of
 traffic,passing along the road.       
                                       
     Our traffic census results are    
 shown on the next page:
