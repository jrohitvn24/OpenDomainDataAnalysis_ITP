  Arts and Crafts are very popular     
  with the residents of Hundon, though 
it is not formalised into the          
establishing a club.                   
  Once every year an Exhibition ofand  
Crafts is organised. Originally this   
was held in the Village Hall though    
since 1983 it has been displayed in the
Parish Church.  The Exhibition  is open
to anyone and is extremely popular.    
  The village Primary School undertakes
the decoration of lthe Church entrance 
porch together with displays of        
Children's work.
