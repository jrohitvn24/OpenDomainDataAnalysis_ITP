		<title>14MINING SUBSIDENCE</title>
		<content> One of the main disadvantages to      
 living in a mining area is the        
 dreadful effect that mining subsidence
 has on houses, and on the roads. Over 
 the past 2 years most parts of        
 Mapplewell have suffered severely from
 mining subsidence. Damage to property 
 ranges from, badly fitting doors and  
 cracked driveways, right up to having 
 to demolish a house because of severe 
 structural damage. Most of the roads  
 around the village are badly affected 
 making travel rather uncomfortable by 
 car, and often dangerous by bicycle.
