		<title>14Changing Times In Kidsgrove</title>
		<content>We interviewed Mrs.Griffiths who has   
lived in Kidsgrove for the last 60     
years.She told us that during that time
Kidsgrove had grown greatly in area.   
There used to be many more shops in    
Kidsgrove selling a wide variety of    
things,but now people shop more in     
Hanley or Newcastle.                   
   Most of the people who lived in     
Kidsgrove when Mrs.Griffiths was young 
worked in the coal mines in Kidsgrove  
or the pot-banks in Burslem or         
Tunstall.                              
   When Mrs.Griffiths was young there  
were two railway stations in Kidsgrove-
one line went to Stoke and the other   
went to Hanley.The canal which goes    
right through the centre of the town   
was much busier than it is now.There   
weren't as many cars or buses as there 
are now.People would walk more.They    
walked to Hanley,Crewe or Congleton.   </content>
