		<content> Hoby House is an old house in the     
 village of Hoby Leicestershire.It is a
 Georgian style house bulit about two  
 hundred years ago.                    
                                       
 The lady who lived in the house, Mrs  
 Beresford, died recently.The house was
 full of valuable antiques including   
 furniture, china, glassware &amp;         
 paintings.All the contents were put up
 for auction in the Spring of 1985. The
 auction attracted considerable        
 interest causing a traffic jam in     
 Hoby! We do not know whether the house
 has been sold or not yet.
