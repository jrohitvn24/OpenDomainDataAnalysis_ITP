		<title>15MADELEY STAFFS : ANXIETIES</title>
		<content> In addition to worries about the lack 
of employment &amp; the imminent closure of
1 of the only 2 factories,there is     
worry about the changes at the Manor   
House.The owner applied for permission 
to open a hotel there.This was refused.
He now wants to use it to give holidays
to disturbed children.Local residents  
have protested.Others have welcomed the
possibilities of jobs there.           
The College of Education closed in 1984
with loss of teaching &amp; service jobs   
for residents &amp; income from student    
lodgings.The building stands empty now.
1 consequence is the closure of the    
only bank,causing problems for business
men &amp; loss of customers to the town.   
The larger of the 2 post offices closed
in 1984.The 1 left is too small.In bad 
weather pensioners queue outside.It has
no parking space,so obstructions occur.
 Public meetings make no difference    </content>
