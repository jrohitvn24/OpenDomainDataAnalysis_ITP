		<title>02The Stocks in Breamore</title>
		<content> Unobtrusively sited along the busy    
 main road from Ringwood to            
 Salisbury,Breamore stocks are easy to 
 miss.Road widening has recently       
 necessitated moving the stocks a few  
 hundred yards from their original     
 site.                                 
 Village records show the existence of 
 stocks here in the late 16th c.,but   
 they probably had been used since     
 Medieval times by the Lord of the     
 Manor for the punishment of lesser    
 offences.It is likely,too,that  a     
{whipping post}and{pillory}were also   
 found nearby,and perhaps a            
 ducking-stool for gossips at the      
 marsh.                                
 Made of perishable wood,the stocks    
 have had to be frequently renewed.    
 Village records contain accounts      
 rendered for their repair or          
 replacement by the village carpenter. </content>
