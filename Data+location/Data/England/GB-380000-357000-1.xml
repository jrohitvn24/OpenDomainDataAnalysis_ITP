		<content> The area covered by the grid is rural.
 the land is part of the undulating    
 Cheshire plain nestling into the      
 foothills of the Pennines.            
 There are two villages in the area    
 Rode Heath and Scholar Green.Both     
 villages try to keep up village       
 traditions despite recent residential 
 building. In the past which dates back
 to pre Norman times the main          
 occupation was agriculture. The       
 opening of the Trent and Mersey canal 
 brouyght other occupations in to the  
 area, especially those concerned with 
 the salt industry at Rode Heath.These 
 however have since disappeared and    
 most of the residents now commute to  
 their work outside the area.
