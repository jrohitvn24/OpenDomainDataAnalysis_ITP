		<content> DAIRY FARMING - CONTD FROM PAGE 17    
 Dairy farms are highly mechanized and 
 so don't need to employ many workers. 
 Both farms we visited only employ 2   
 men. They are all local men travelling
 to work by bus, bike and car. On one  
 of the farms they worked on average a 
 35 hour working week, while on the    
 other the working week was 50 hours.  
 As the working year on a dairy farm   
 doesn't really vary they don't need to
 employ any extra workers.             
 If anyone wanted to start up a farm in
 the district they would either have to
 be very wealthy as land price is      
 generally around Â£1000+ per acre. The 
 price depending upon the quality of   
 the land. Or they could start off by  
 renting a farm and gradually buying   
 the farm over a period of time.
