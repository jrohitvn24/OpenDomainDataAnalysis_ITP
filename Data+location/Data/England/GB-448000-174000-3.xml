		<title>03Education Around World's End</title>
		<content> This area does not contain a school   
 for over sevens. People living here   
 send their children to a school in    
 Newbury, which is about 5 miles away, 
 or Chieveley (1 mile away) which is   
 nearer to get to from the area. The   
 area does however contain a nursery   
 school for infants. This is located in
 the village hall at World's End. The  
 people say that when their children   
 are 14, they will send them to a      
 senior school at Compton, about 3     
 miles away which is quite far to go. A
 landowner said that they would have to
 build a senior nearer to them. The    
 education is good but there should be 
 more teachers because the population  
 is increasing.
