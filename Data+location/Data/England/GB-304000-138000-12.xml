		<content>    Bungy bought{2 of his 6 heavy      
{horses }from the Elephant and Castle  
 in London. A horse drawn self binder  
 was used for cutting the corn until   
 his first tractor, a{Case, came in    
{1938.}The corn was put into stooks    
 then ricks then threshed.             
    In 1950 Bungy had his first{combine
{harvester.}The{outbuildings}were used 
 as a cowpen, milking parlour, pig     
 rearing pen and sheep pen. The sheep  
 were shorn by hand driven shears.     
{Bungy retired in 1961 but continues to
{live in Yarde in a house built on his 
{former land by a retiring school      
{mistress in the mid thirties.}Although

 vegetables.Both early morning and     
 afternoon they walk their dogs over   
 the local fields and lanes.           </content>
