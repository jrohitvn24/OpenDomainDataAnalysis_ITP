		<title>11CORBY LINKS WITH GERMANY.</title>
		<content>Being one of the few British schools   
offering German as a first foreign     
language, we interviewed 167 parents of
1st year pupils and found that: 46% had
studied a foreign language at school,  
usually French, 3% had studied German, 
only 14% couldn't remember any of it!  
Although most thought their study had  
been of no practical use, 99% wanted   
their children to learn one "because it
might be useful in later life". 84%    
preferred German, but only 21% had been
to Germany.                            
10 pupils from our twin-town of        
Velbert, after visiting Corby, said    
they liked our large school building,  
semi- detached houses, friendly shop   
assistants, pedestrian precincts and   
cheap taxis. They disliked monotonous  
housing, the scarcity of trees,        
unemployed people and Corby's small    
swimming pool!                         </content>
