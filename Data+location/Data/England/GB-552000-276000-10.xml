 (Interview....farmer then 14 year old)
 The day started at 6.00 a.m. with the 
 milking of the 16 cows by hand.       
 Breakfast was at 8.00 a.m. followed by
 land work until 'docky' at 10.00 a.m. 
 (small snack). More work on the land  
 followed until the main meal at 2.00  
 p.m. After the meal the horses were   
 fed and groomed. The cows were milked 
 a second time about 5.00 p.m. followed
 by tea at 6.00 p.m. The evening was   
 spent doing yard work, cleaning the   
 cowsheds, washing down the yard and   
 generally clearing up before finishing
 for the day at 9.00 p.m. There were   
 few amenities and so he soon went to  
 bed ready for the next days work. For 
 this 15 hour day he was paid 2        
 shillings a day (10p).
