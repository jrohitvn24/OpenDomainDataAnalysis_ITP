 the Marshall family.The church is     
 large and has a large grave yard.It's 
 got twenty four to twenty six people  
 in the choir.On a Sunday two hundred  
 people come to church.One church      
 service  goes on for half an hour,and 
 the other for one hour.There is only  
 one bell ringer.There have been ten   
 weddings in the past year.            
    Crosthwaite church was claimed for 
 Christianity in AD 553.But we do not  
 know when it was made.The glass       
 windows were made in the 19th         
 century.The church has 8 bells and    
 10 bellringers.The longest serving    
 Vicar is Thomas Christian.He was Vicar
 from 1728 to 1770.There are some very 
 old windows in the church.
