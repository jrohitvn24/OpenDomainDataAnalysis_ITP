		<title>16Lyewood Nursery,Ropley</title>
		<content> Lyewood Nursery,Petersfield Road,has a
 plot of 5.7 acres of which 1.2 acres  
 are glasshouses.It was built up from  
 1972 when the Carruthers family moved 
 in and there were only poly-tunnels.It
 has been modernised since then with   
 much new equipment the latest of which
 is a generator to produce power for   
 heating and lighting if there is a    
 power failure.Heating is from an oil  
 -fired boiler and heating costs have  
 gone up enormously.In Winter the main 
 plants are cyclamen which are sold at 
 Covent Garden Market,London.In Spring,
 the busiest time of the year,bedding  
 plants are sold to garden centres.The 
 nursery employs 6 people full time    
 (which includes 3 from the family) and
 8-13 part time workers at busy times  
 of the year.All the money made in the 
 business goes back into capital       
 investment.                           </content>
