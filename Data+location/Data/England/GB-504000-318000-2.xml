   The land to the west side of Bourne 
 is mainly farmland - a mixture of     
 arable and grassland.Corn, oil seed   
 rape and sugar beet are the main      
 crops. Sheep, beef cattle and horses  
 are reared on the grasslands.         
   After combining farmers have the    
 facilities for drying their corn ready
 for marketing. The farms are highly   
 mechanised, large modern machinery    
 having replaced most of the labour    
 force.                                
   Adjacent woodlands provide cover for
 deer, foxes and game which encroach on
 farmland causing damage to crops. An  
 old custom used on one farm to        
 discourage deer is that of obtaining  
 human hair from a local hairdresser to
 put into old onion nets, which are    
 then attached to boundary posts.      </content>
