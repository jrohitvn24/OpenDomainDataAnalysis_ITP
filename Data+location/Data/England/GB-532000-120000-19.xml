		<title>19Wivelsfield - Local History</title>
		<content> The Wivelsfield area comprises three  
 parts -the village of{Wivelsfield     
{Green,}the area of Burgess Hill known 
 as{World's End}and the{Southern part  
{of Haywards Heath.}The village is     
 divided by the B2112, the oldest part 
 being to the west of the road. After  
 the Black Death struck, a new         
 settlement was built a mile or so     
 away from the original.               
                                       
 There remain a few old cottages       
 clustered around the church in the old
 part, one of which was used at one    
 time as a post office and stores.     
                                       
 There is an interesting 16th century  
{moated farmhouse}to the east of the   
 main road.                            
                                       
 Wivelsfield is reputed to be the{most 
{haunted parish in Sussex !            </content>
