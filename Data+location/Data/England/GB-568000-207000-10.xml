		<title>10A New Surgery in Chelmsford</title>
		<content>   The{doctor's surgery at Newlands    
{Spring}only opened in March this year 
 and so far only looks after{500       
{patients,}so the doctor has another   
 practice in Chelmsford. She also makes
{house visits}to see people who are    
 disabled.She has a job at{St.John's   
{Hospital}treating chronically ill     
 patients and spends much of her time, 
 even her day off,examining people at  
 other hospitals.She also has many     
{medical meetings}to attend.           
   The doctor feels that the most      
 important part of her job is{listening
{to people}and looking after them while
{"nature heals them herself."}She has  
 two children and a number of hobbies  
 which help her to take her mind off   
 her work.She is gradually getting to  
 know many of the people in the area   
 and is of{great value to the families 
{of Newlands Spring.                   </content>
