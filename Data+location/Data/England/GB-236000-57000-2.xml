 A new world of boats has appeared on  
 the banks of the River Lynher near    
 Landrake. It has transformed disused  
 Treluggan Quarry,into one of the most 
 imaginative marine projects to have   
 been started in the south east of     
 Cornwall for many years.              
  {Boating World}was the brainchild of 
 a West Midlands businessman who came  
 to Cornwall seeking the perfect       
 site for his plan for a complete      
 marine centre.He looked for three     
 years before finding the quarry two   
 miles from Landrake complete with     
 buildings and even its own quay and   
 slipway.                              
  "It was exactly what I was looking   
 for. The land was hard and tarmaced   
 with about five acres of flat ground  
 plus a factory,offices and other      
 buildings.                            </content>
