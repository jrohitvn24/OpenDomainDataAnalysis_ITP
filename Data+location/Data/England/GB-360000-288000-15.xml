		<title>15DITTON PRIORS SURGERY.</title>
		<content> The building which is now the{Doctors 
{Surgery}was established in{1960}as a  
 house for the village policeman.In{   
{1968}it was transformed into a{Doctors
{Surgery}which would cover an area of{ 
{200}sq miles.The{6}staff caters for an
 average of{130}patients a week with{  
{2500}people in their care.The surgery 
 is also a{Pharmacy}whose main medical 
 suppliers are{Philip Harris}and{Co}of 
 Birmingham and{Rudge Roberts}of       
 Shrewsbury.                           
 The doctors have also got a specially 
 designed{computer}which               
 prints out the prescriptions and does 
 an up-to-date sheet of the patients   
 medication and lists of patients who  
 need to be recalled for various tests.
 The{computers}job is to make the      
 surgery more efficient because it     
 covers such a large rural area.       
 The doctors are{Dr.Kirk and Dr.Groves.</content>
