		<title>12Charity Work in Malhamdale</title>
		<content> The people of Malhamdale as a whole   
 are very insular.They are generous,but
 especially if it concerns them or     
 their children.For example,after a    
 local increase in the incidence of    
 cancer,much money was raised for a new
 scanner at Airedale Hospital,and for a
 hospice in Leeds.The fund-raising     
 events to provide Kirkby Malham School
 with a microcomputer were also very   
 well attended.                        
 Coffee mornings and jumble sales are  
 very popular and are an effective     
 method of raising money within the    
 dale.For instance,Airton Women's      
 Institute holds an annual jumble sale.
