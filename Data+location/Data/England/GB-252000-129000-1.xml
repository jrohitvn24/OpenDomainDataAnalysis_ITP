 We are making a survey for the{       
{Domesday Book}which will tell people  
 in the future what life is like today.
 The original{Domesday Book}was ordered
 by William the Conqueror in 1086 to   
 take stock of the land.Then scribes   
 went about the country taking notes by
 hand,but we can use modern technology.
 People all over the country are       
 helping with the survey.              
  The district which we were asked to  
 survey is a mainly rural area which   
 lies just south of {Barnstaple}the    
 main market town for much of {North   
 Devon.Grid reference {02520129.}
