		<title>03Industry and Housing</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in our area were   
 built in the 1930's and 1940's.This   
 means that the majority of our homes  
 are 40 or 50 years old.There is not   
 much new housing in our area and      
 surprisingly in our block there was   
 not one tower block.                  
 The typical 1930s house is two        
 storeys with wooden or metal window   
 frames.Most are built in terraces of  
 six or eight but some are             
 semi-detached.All are brick           
 built.Nearly all the factories around 
 our area are foundries which means    
 they make or work metal.One factory   
 close to our school makes             
 cutlery,another makes components for  
 the motor industry.Also in our area we
 have what is probably the oldest hand 
 rolling mill in England making steel  
 mostly for export.
