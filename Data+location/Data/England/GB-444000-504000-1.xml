		<content> Our area was mentioned in the first   
 Domesday Book as a place of some      
 importance, having a large manor and  
 one of ten places in Cleveland with a 
 church. We don't know where this      
 church was situated.There are various 
 theories, one is a wooden building    
 where the Post Office is today.The    
 church used today was built in 14     
 century. The Methodist church was     
 visited a dozen times by John Wesley  
 from 1759 onwards,he actually drew    
 crowds to the Green. The two other    
 major things we feel should be        
 mentioned are the closing of the Mill 
 opposite to the church in approx.     
 1908. The mill was demolished in 1937 
 to make way for widening the road to  
 accommodate the ever increasing       
 traffic. The bridge was widened to two
 lanes in April 1973, a footpath laid  
 up Rudby Bank to the Bay Horse Pub.   </content>
