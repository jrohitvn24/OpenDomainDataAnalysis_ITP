		<title>16 Changes in Killingworth</title>
		<content> Many new flats, houses ,factories and 
shops have been built in Killingworth. 
Killingworth is a favourite shopping   
place, and lots of people go there     
regularly to buy things because they   
find it cheaper there than anywhere    
else. I go to the library, the Sports  
Centre, Swimming Baths and to the lake 
to look at the swans. Most elderly     
people I know say that Killingworth    
New Town is a change for the better,   
and so do I.

 A long time ago Killingworth was a    
village. The pond and nearby fields    
were full of wild life, geese, ducks,  
birds and lots of rabbits. Killingworth
has changed from a quiet country       
village into a busy town.
