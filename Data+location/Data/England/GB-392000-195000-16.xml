		<title>16THE CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content>{Rodmarton cricket club}was formed     
 approximately 60 years ago with the   
 squire, the{Hon.Claude Biddulph}&amp; his 
 son, Major A.Biddulph taking a keen   
 interest in it as his grandsons, Simon
 &amp; Jasper now do. Major Biddulph kept  
 upthe interest until his death in 1984
 At one time all the team came from    
 Rodmarton but as the years went by and
 young people moved out to find work   
 players came from further afield{.Now 
 sadly, there are only{14 players}in   
 the club.They are keen and though the 
 atmosphere is friendly they go out    
 determined to win.At the end of the   
 season the team usually have won as   
 many games as they have lost. The     
 field is infront of the village hall  
 where teas are served. At the end of  
 the season players &amp; their wives ,    
 committee members and supporters have 
 an Xmas dinner and then presentations.</content>
