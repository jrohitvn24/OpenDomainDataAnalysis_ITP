		<title>10FERNLEIGH REST HOME,LEASOWE</title>
		<content> I visited the only Old People's Home  
 within Leasowe,called{Fernleigh.}In   
 Fernleigh there are 66 residents,12   
 men and 54 ladies.The oldest person   
 there is 99 years old,and her name is 
 Mrs. Mary Jones.The youngest person is
 65 years old.                         
 There are 66 beds available,with 4    
 lounges,one large dining area,1 large 
 kitchen,and 3 small kitchens.5 beds   
 are kept for emergency,for people who 
 desperately need to go into the home. 
 The staff are mainly part-time (night 
 staff included),and mostly women.     
 The residents have several pets to    
 keep them company,and a small rose    
 garden.The local senior schoolchildren
 visit to talk and help with gardening.
 More could be done to keep the people 
 amused and interested,but generally   
 the home is bright and comfortable.
