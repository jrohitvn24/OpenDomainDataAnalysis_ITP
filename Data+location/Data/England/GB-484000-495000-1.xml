		<title>01Lockton High Moor</title>
		<content> Predominantly high, open, heather     
 dominated moorland bisected by the    
 main A169 road. The south east has 1km
 of conifer plantation and there are   
 some woodlands and plantation in th   
 west in a steep soiled valley along   
 which runs the Nor York shire moors   
 railway. Most of the area to east     
 of the road is Ministry of Defence    
 property and has the Fybngdales early 
 warning staion. The only residents of 
 the block are the forces personnel who
 work there. Sheep graze the area ad   
 there are some cattle on rough grazing
 in the south. Because of access       
 problems the area is not heavily      
 visited by tourists or walkers        
 although the high moors and the valley
 to te east make spectacular scenery   
 for those driving through or viewing  
 from further south.
