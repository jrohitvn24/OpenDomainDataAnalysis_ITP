		<title>15FARMER'S VIEW, NORTH STOKE</title>
		<content> North Stoke lies one kilometre from   
 Amberley station, along a cul-de-sac  
 road. Houses, sheds, barns and machin-
 ery are scattered at random along its 
 one road, culminating in the farm and 
 church (one service monthly). This    
 farm is owned by a Limited Company and
 run by a tenant farmer. The pressure  
 is on to isolate this village further.
    "The trains from Amberley have been
 halved; bus services suspended; the   
 school bus withdrawn. We have no gas  
 or shop. Sanitation is by septic tank.
 Water is pumped from wells electric-  
 ally. We grow our own vegetables,     
 collect wood or buy coal. There are no
 amenities in this village. A car is   
 vital for any of us, old and young to 
 attend any social function. Beautiful 
 it may be, but I'm leaving farming to 
 go teaching at Shoreham. It's too cut 
 off here."                            </content>
