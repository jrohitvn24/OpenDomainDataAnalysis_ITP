		<title>16THE QUALTITY OF LIFE</title>
		<content>     In many ways the quality of life  
 here rests in the peacefulness of the 
 rural environment, though this is     
 often more appreciated by the incomers
 who have chosen to live here than     
 those who have inherited it!          
    In general it is probably true to  
 say that the pace of life is slow,    
 still governed by the environmental   
 factors of relative remoteness, the   
 seasons and the weather.              
    This suits people like Brian Slack.
 a professional artist and sculptor who
 settled here from London in the       
 1970's.
