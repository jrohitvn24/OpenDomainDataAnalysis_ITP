   This area is in rural{Yorkshire}on  
 the eastern edge of the Pennines.There
 are two villages,{Constable Burton}and
{Finghall}and several small farms.     
{                                      
{ }Constable Burton is just off the    
 main{A684}road which runs from        
 Northallerton to Hawes.It is a small  
 village built mainly of stone.        
                                       
   Finghall is also small,and is on the
 minor road which runs along the ridge 
 of high ground to the south of the    
 area.                                 
                                       
   The land is steepest to the north   
 and south of the area and slopes in   
 the centre down to Constable Burton   
 beck,which flows eastwards to join the
 Swale near Bedale about 10 miles away.
