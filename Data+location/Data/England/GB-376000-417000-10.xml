		<title>10THE M66 MOTORWAY</title>
		<content> The{M66}is the most important road in 
 our area.This road leads to other     
 major roads,the{M62}and{M63}.The M66  
 was built in 1979.The M66 as it passes
 our school becomes the                
 Edenfield/Rawtenstall by-pass which   
 links with the Haslingden             
 by-pass.Recently we checked the       
 traffic on the motorway and there were
 approximately 850 vehicles an hour    
 travelling towards Bury,and 880       
 vehicles an hour travelling towards   
 Rawtenstall and Haslingden.           
 Helmshore road is very old and was    
 formerly a toll road.                 
 Also Market Street in Edenfield is    
 over 200 years old.                   
 The M66 took most of the heavy traffic
 from Bolton Road North, which         
 resulted in quieter roads in Edenfield
 and Stubbins.
