		<title>03LIFE IN EAST LANGDON.</title>
		<content> Village residents have noticed        
 important changes since 1945. In      
 particular the vilage has grown       
 inspite of the fact that families are 
 now much smaller. The number of farms 
 has decreased from 3 to 2. This,with  
 mechanisation and a change to live_   
 stock from arable farming,has led to  
 fewer local people doing farm jobs.   
 The fact that most families have a car
 enables them to get to work elsewhere.
 The village is quiet and the residents
 like the countryside and the people,  
 but there is a feeling that the sense 
 of community has declined. Village    
 life still centres around the church  
 and it's hall where Bingo is played.  
 The local pub has closed but there    
 are soccer and cricket teams. Best    
 remembered events of the last twenty  
 years include the Jubilee party and a 
 visit by the Archbishop of Canterbury.</content>
