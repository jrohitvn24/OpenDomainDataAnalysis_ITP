 sandy. The major part of the land is  
 rough pasture and the rest supports   
 heathland vegetation.                 
   The few private houses that there   
 are, are of a very substantial nature,
 being finished and maintained to a    
 very high standard indeed.The largest 
 concentration of buildings on the site

 About a year ago, it was sold to a    
 religious group and used by them      
 for very large gatherings. Potentially
 this could have considerable affect   
  in what is essentially a very quiet  
 and sparsely populated district.      
    An overhead power line, supported  
 on metal pylons, passes right through 
 this area. It is a great visual intru-
