		<title>08SCHOOL CANTEEN</title>
		<content> The school canteen was once a boy's   
 Grammar school in the 1800's.Now it is
 used for the Richard Clarke School    
 as the school canteen.There are four  
 ladies who cook and prepare the       
 meals.There are also four ladies who  
 supervise the children at meal        
 times.As the canteen will only hold 64
 children the dinner time has to split 
 into two sittings.The first sitting is
 at 12.00 and all the children have to 
 be walked up the road from the school,
 the second sitting is at 12.30.
