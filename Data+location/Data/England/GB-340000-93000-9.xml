		<content>    The only part of this area served  
 by public transport is on the A.35    
 road. This section lies on the route  
 of the Southern National Bus Company  
 between Weymouth and Taunton. It      
 connects villages en route , and      
 starting at 06.30 hours provides a    
 more or less hourly bus service in    
 both directions until early evening.  
 There is no sunday Service of         
 buses.Some transport is provided for  
 zschool children.                     
    It must be remembered that roads in
 the area other than the A.35 are      
 unsuitable for buses and that most of 
 the adult inhabitants have their own  
 transport.The nearest railway         
 connections are at Axminster,9miles,  
 Crewkerne 15m.and Dorchester 21m.     
    The Regional Airports of Exeter and
 Hurn (Bournemouth) are 40m. away along
 the A.35 road.                        </content>
