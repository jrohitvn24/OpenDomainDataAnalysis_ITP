		<title>02Why "Hexhamshire"</title>
		<content> History books tell us that "In the    
 seventh century,{Hexhamshire}was that 
 part of the marriage dower of         
 Etheldeda, wife of King Egfrith, King 
 of Northumbria, which she bestowed    
 upon her favourite, St Wilfrid,       
 Archbishop of York."                  
 Originally{Hexhamshire}covered a wide 
 area, including{Hexham}itself, and as 
 far as{St John Lee}to the north, and  
{Allendale}to the west. Nowadays it    
 covers the{present survey}area,and    
 stretches to Slaley Forest to the     
 south.{Administratively}, the name is 
 kept in the{Parish Councils}of        
{Hexhamshire}, and{Hexhamshire Low     
{Quarter}.Although the population is   
 widely-scattered, it is also a very   
 active and close-knit{rural community}
 with its own church,school,sportsfield
 and village hall -but no shop!
