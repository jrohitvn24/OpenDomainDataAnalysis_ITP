		<title>02HISTORY OF HAMPTON,HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> In 1800 the small area of land        
 contained in this Block  was more     
 extensive than it is today by about 30
 acres. In 1800 the area was used for  
 farmland with a large brick farmhouse 
 and nearby were several wooden huts   
 occupied by fishermen who also had a  
 reputation as smugglers. This hamlet  
 of Hampton also possessed a public    
 house called the Beehive. In 1866 the 
 Hampton Oyster Company was opened by  
 the Mayor of London. This was to rival
 the Whitstable Companies. A pier was  
 built so that boats connected with the
 trade could load and unload. The      
 Company was quite profitable for about
 15 years but then the operations were 
 moved to Faversham. It is thought that
 the building of the pier caused       
 erosion of the land on its westward   
 side and 30 acres containing the old  
 buildings were worn away.             </content>
