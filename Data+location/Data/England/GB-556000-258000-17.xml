		<title>17THE HARE PARK STUD YEAR</title>
		<content>    In the summer, the mares and foals 
 live out in the paddocks both day and 
 night. The stud manager keeps an eye  
 on the mares that are foaling. He     
 checks to see that there are no       
 poisonous weeds, such as ragwort,     
 growing in the paddocks and that the  
 water supply is alright.              
    In the winter, the horses are kept 
 in big, roomy loose-boxes. They are   
 fed in the morning on corn, mash and  
 hay. Then the stables are mucked out. 
 If the weather is fine and there is no
 snow or ice, the horses are turned out
 into the paddocks. In the late        
 afternoon they are brought in and fed 
 again. They spend all night in their  
 loose-boxes.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
