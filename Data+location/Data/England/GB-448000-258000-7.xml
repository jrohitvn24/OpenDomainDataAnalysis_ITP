		<title>07Portrait of a Farm(number 2)</title>
		<content>This 2nd farm is smaller, only 112     
acres.95 acres are in our block.The    
farm is devoted entirely to animals.250
sheep are kept.These are known as      
Mules.This animal produces a good meat 
lamb.It is bred from a Scottish black- 
face crossed with Blue-faced Leicester.
The sheep are purchased at various mar-
kets in the north of England(e.g.Hawes,
Lazenby and Castle Douglas.)They are   
sold at Banbury and Rugby markets.     
22 cattle are kept.These are Hereford  
animals crossed with Friesians.This    
cross produces a good beef.            
The land needs an occasional dressing  
of lime.Fertiliser and farmyard manure 
is applied annually.The land(in the s.w
of our block)has a slight tendency to  
be deficient in magnesium.
