		<title>10Businesses in Ufton Village.</title>
		<content>                                       
  In the village of Ufton itself there 
are only three established businesses: 
1.The Village Shop.                    
2.The White Hart Inn.                  
3.The Garage.                          
The shop is a typical general store/   
post office selling fruit and veg.     
confectionery; newspapers; tinned food 
etc.It is thought to be too small but  
there is no space for an extension.    
There is considerable passing trade.   
The Inn has no accomodation for guests 
although it is a food orientated pub   
which relies to a great extent on      
attracting customers from the          
surrounding towns.Local people support 
the pub with their custom.Traditional  
beer and home cooked meals are the     
main attraction.   There is a small    
garage for car repair.
