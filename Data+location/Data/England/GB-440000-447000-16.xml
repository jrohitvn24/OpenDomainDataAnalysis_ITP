		<title>16WETHERBY LORRY PARK</title>
		<content>  The Wetherby lorry park is a popular 
 overnight stopping point for lorry    
 drivers. A recent survey revealed the 
 following figures:Monday (37 lorries),
 Tuesday(39),Wednesday(33),Thursday(51)
 Friday(43),Saturday(11) and Sunday(9) 
 giving an average of 32. Early in the 
 week the average is 38 but towards the
 end of the working week this increaes 
 to 47. At the weekend the numbers     
 decrease, especially on Sunday.       
  The lorry park seems to be a perfect 
 stopping-off point between the north  
 and south of Britain. Seventy per cent
 of the lorries were north-east based  
 (mainly from Ashington, Tynemouth,    
 Stockton-on-Tees, and Newcastle). Some
 lorries did come from south of        
 Wetherby (Salisbury and Coventry). At 
 the weekend the lorries remaining were
 either Wetherby based drivers, or     
 local companies e.g. George Moores.   </content>
