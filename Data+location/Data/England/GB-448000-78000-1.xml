		<content>  The area which we are surveying is   
 mainly farming area.There are no      
 universities or schools.At the very   
 edge of the area there is a small     
 hamlet called Roud, and we have a     
 village called Chale Green.The village
 has a shop with a petrol pump but most
 people shop in the larger towns a few 
 miles away.There are many old         
 buildings including one on the downs  
 called {Hoy's Monument.}
