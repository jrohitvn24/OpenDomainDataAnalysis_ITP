		<content>The pews are carved with a 'poppyhead' 
design, reflecting                     
the link with the fields surrounding   
the village. Today, the church still   
plays a leading role in the life of the
community. The Rector, as well as      
conducting  a range of services in the 
church including a Family Service once 
a month, contributes articles to the   
village Newsletter which is published  
once a month. Sunday School meets twice
a month and the church organises an    
annual Fete which takes place in July. 
The church is also used as a display   
area for organisations which           
incorporate both the Christian and     
social aspects of the village life.
