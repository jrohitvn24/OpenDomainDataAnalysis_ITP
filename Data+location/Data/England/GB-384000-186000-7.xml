		<title>07SHERSTON'S HOUSING STOCK</title>
		<content>     The pattern of housing in Sherston
 is{changing radically.}An attractive  
 stone-built village means that as old 
 cottages come on the market they are  
 bought up by retired townspeople,     
 modernised and{"gentrified"}until     
 their market value is far beyond the  
 reach of old village families, whose  
 children have to move into flats in   
 neighbouring towns. Even the new      
 housing estates, with the high        
 price of land, are aimed at middle    
 class occupiers, who commute to       
 Bristol and move on frequently.       
   Council houses are now available for
 purchase by their tenants. Those which
 have been resold have gone to         
 professional families, so less housing
 is available for low-income families. 
 From being a well-balanced traditional
 community, the village risks becoming 
 a geriatric{museum piece.             </content>
