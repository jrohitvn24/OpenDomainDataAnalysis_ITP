		<title>02Bickerstaffe Parish Church</title>
		<content>The only church in the area is         
Bickerstaffe Parish Church, named Holy 
Trinity. The church was built in 1843  
in a joint deal between Lord Derby and 
the local parishoners. Lord Derby      
donated the stone on condition that the
parishoners collected and moved it.    
     The North Aisle is mid-Victorian  
built about 1870, and the vestry is    
early 20th century. The builting is of 
historical interest not only because it
shows several periods of building but  
more importantly because of it's roof  
structure.                             
      The church must be one of the    
first churches to be built with a      
laminated roof structure which only    
became popular in 1900. The Victorian  
section of the church was built with a 
straight wood structure.
