		<title>12THE SEVERN FLOODS AND BORES</title>
		<content>THE RIVER BRINGS ITS PROBLEMS          
 The stretch of the River Severn which 
runs through the area is called Long   
Reach. Every winter the river overflows
its banks and floods the valley. The   
floodwaters can reach Sandhurst, often 
covering the road to Gloucester south  
of the village. When this happens the  
villagers must go east through Walls-  
worth to find a dry route out.         
 In the Sandhurst School log book it   
was recorded on 29th January 1960 that 
a teacher, Mrs Dudfield, had to be car-
ried across deep flood water to get her
to the school! From Maisemore Park the 
floods can stretch up to 2km to the    
southeast across the Vale of           
Gloucester towards the city.           
 The Severn is world-famous for its    
Bore, a tidal wave which is highest in 
spring. This is visible at Sandhurst,  
but so far inland it is not very large.</content>
