		<title>07BLACKO SCHOOL CHRISTMAS  (2)</title>
		<content> ......We set off around the village   
 singing carols accompanied by two     
 children playing the recorder and     
 flute. We collected money to send to  
 Cancer Research and another Christmas 
 Collection at our concert was sent to 
 help the Ethiopian Famine Appeal.     
 Father Christmas came to the infant's 
 party - he gave presents to everyone  
 and we all gathered round the         
 Christmas Tree to sing 'Away in a     
 Manger.'It has been a lovely Christmas
 in school this year seeing everyone   
 excited and a happy sparkle in        
 people's eyes. Christmas at home is a 
 happy time for all the family.Typical 
 presents for children this year       
 include home computers, B.M.X.        
 Bicycles, electronic toys etc. - Very 
 different from 100 years ago when     
 children were given an orange and a   
 small sum of money.................   </content>
