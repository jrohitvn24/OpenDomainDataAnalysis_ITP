		<title>10Lt.Kimble Union Free Church</title>
		<content>  The average number of people each    
Sunday is about 15 to 20 .It has pipes 
which are plugged into the electricity 
so that it is kept warm .It is very    
small.Every Tuesday there is a Girls   
Brigade.It starts at half past 6 and   
ends at eight oÂ£clock.Captain and Lefty
are in charge.There is a kitchen as    
well.The Church decided to seek new    
premises and bought this site from     
the Earl of Buckingham for 7 pounds 10 
pence in 1915.The cost of the building 
without the organ and pews was 2000    
pounds.When finished the Church was    
opened on 9th. July 1923 by Dame       
Margaret Lloyd George in the presence  
of 500 people.It has not got any bells.
