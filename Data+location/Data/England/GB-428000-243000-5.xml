 around a large village pond fringed   
 with reeds and willow trees,which is  
 the home of wildfowl.The woods are    
 mainly deciduous,of ash,sycamore and  
 oak.There are many trees and bushes in
 the village and areas of grass        
 adjoining the pond and roads giving a 
 spacious feeling.There are 5 houses   
 built of local blue lyas and Hornton  
 stone one of which is thatched.The    
 remaining 24 are brick.Idlicote house 
 is on the site of an ancient fortified
 building with a moat.                 
 Oxhill and Whatcote lie on the heavy  
 brown clay in the vale of the red     
 horse and are surrounded by open      
 fields many still with ridge and      
 furrow,and surrounded by well trimmed 
 hedges.
