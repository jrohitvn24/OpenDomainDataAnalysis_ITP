		<title>05Grantham:St. Vincents</title>
		<content> The South Kesteven District Coucil has
 two major administrative buildings.   
 Several offices are in the centre of  
 the town at the Guildhall.The Chief   
 Executive, the Secretary,and the      
 District Planning Officer have their  
 offices in the building known as St   
 Vincents. This was built as a private 
 residence in Victorian gothic style   
 towards the end of the last century.  
 During the Second World War the       
 building housed the local Headquarters
 of Bomber Command.Many major raids on 
 Germany were planned here including   
 the Dambusters raid. As a result of   
 this association with the Royal Air   
 Force a small museum devoted to air   
 warfare has recently been set up at St
 Vincents.As St Vincents now houses the
 Superintendant of Marriages,civil     
 weddings now take place there.
