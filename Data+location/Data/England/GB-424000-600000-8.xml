 church cost Â£1,200.This money was     
 donated by Henry Earl Grey (Â£1.100)and
 Addison John Baker Esq of Cresswell   
 gave (Â£100.)The church is made out of 
 black dolomite whinstone from the     
 local quarry.The chancel and vestry   
 was bulit in 1893,and cost Â£658.The   
 church is lucky enough to have two    
 organs built by Harrison and Harrison 
 of Durham.During the war,St.John's was
 used as an airforce church,for all the
 servicemen from Acklington, since then
 the congragation has slowly decreased,
 and now it is at an all time low.
