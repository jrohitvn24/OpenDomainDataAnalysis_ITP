		<title>11TRAFFIC CENSUS IN ANLABY</title>
		<content> A traffic census was taken one day    
 between 8.30 a.m. and 1 p.m. As Anlaby
 is a suburban village close to Hull,  
 it is not surprising that most of the 
 traffic movement comes as a result of 
 people travelling to and from the     
 city. By far the biggest percentage of
 vehicles used is the private car (69%)
 - most often red ones! The next most  
 frequent users of the roads in the    
 village are the cyclists - usually    
 school children. Only 4% of the       
 traffic consisted of lorries. This is 
 not too surprising since, to the north
 of Anlaby, there is a busy by-pass    
 which most of the heavy lorries use.  
 The heaviest concentration of traffic 
 occurred between 8.30 - 9 a.m. and    
 between 12 - 1 p.m.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
