		<title>19A GIRL IN WHITKIRK</title>
		<content> On{Tuesday}like most days I get up at 
 half past seven and go downstairs for 
 breakfast. After breakfast I go       
 upstairs to get washed and dressed.{On
{the way to school}I usually call for a
 friend and we talk about various      
 things. Usually on a Tuesday our      
 first lesson is handwriting and then  
 we have science and humanities. Dinner
 time; thank goodness I think to       
 myself!{In the afternoon}we have      
 English and Maths.{At home time}I find
 Keely again and we walk home together.
{At home}I have my tea straight away,  
 normally sandwiches and some orange   
 juice. If time I play out, especially 
 in the summer, with my sister Jill and
 other children. Jill goes to{brownies 
 on a Tuesday and I watch television   
 until I go to{bed,}which is usually   
 about nine o'clock. I am ten years    
 old.                                  </content>
