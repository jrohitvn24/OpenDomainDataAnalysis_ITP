		<title>11POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> The{Post Office}in Shirwell is at the 
 village shop which only recently took 
 over this function from a villager    
 whose front room  had been converted  
 for the purpose.  A plaque still      
 remains in place on the house where   
 the post office used to be. There are 
 two collecting boxes, one being at the
 local village shop itself and the     
 other further down in Shirwell Town.  
   There are 3 postmen delivering mail 
 to the village in vans (red) from the 
 collecting main office in Barnstaple, 
 each having the Shirwell run for a    
 week.They deliver each morning and if 
 familiar with the house holder will   
 open the door and put the mail on     
 chairs,tables etc and if lucky have a 
 hot drink.                            
 There is only 1 public telephone      
 situated in the village near the post 
 office.                               </content>
