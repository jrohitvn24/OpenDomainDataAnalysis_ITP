		<title>09INTERVIEW WITH A LOCAL</title>
		<content>   Mrs Olley has lived in the village  
 of Blofield Heath for 50 years.In the 
 interview we asked her how the area   
 and peoples attitudes have changed    
 over the years.During the interview   
 Mrs Olley explained how the village   
 has changed from a rural village where
 everyone knew each other to a small   
 town.Although being a rural village   
 they did feel the hardships of the    
 war.They had rationing,evacuees from  
 London and watched the bombings of the
 main towns.For entertainment people   
 went to social evenings or dances.They
 never had discos.Young residents      
 played 'valentines'involving uprooting
 plants from gardens,or they went      
 scrumping.The children played tag,    
 rounders and hopscotch in the streets.
 We found that Blofield Heath has      
 changed considerably including peoples
 attitudes and street names.           </content>
