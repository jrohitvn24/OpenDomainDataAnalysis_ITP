      The area has very little in it   
except for farms although there is the 
main A229 Maistone to Hastings road on 
the east most end.                     
                                       
      As a result of this the pupils   
were not perhaps as enthusiastic in    
doing the survey as one migh have      
hoped.                                 
                                       
      In spite of their reluctance to  
produce exciting prose they did manage 
learn a great deal about the area      
(even though it did not contain their  
own town of Cranbrook).                
                                       
      Keyboard skills were also        
improved although they still took a    
long time to type even what has been   
 roduced.
