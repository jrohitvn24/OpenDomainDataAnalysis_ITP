		<title>11A day in the life of...</title>
		<content> When I get up in the morning I go     
 downstairs and make my breakfast and  
 switch the television on and then     
 watch Popeye.I go upstairs and get    
 dressed then I brush my hair and go to
 school with my sister  and we meet    
 Lisa's friend at the Coop and when we 
 get to school I play a little while   
 with my friends.On Wednesdays we have 
 hymn practice first thing and we sing 
 songs and Miss Simpson tells us a     
 story.Then we go back to our class and
 do our work.When it is dinner-time we 
 have our dinner and then our pudding  
 and then go out to play. In the       
 afternoon we do our work and sometimes
 we play rounders and have stories.    
 After school we go home and play out  
 and sometimes we go for a walk with   
 the dog down by the River Don and we  
 pass St.Oswald's church on the way    
 there.                                </content>
