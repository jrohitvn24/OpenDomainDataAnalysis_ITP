		<content>     The bus service which calls to    
 the                                   
 village on its journey from Maidstone 
 to Folkestone is not very regular and 
 most people in the area have to rely  
 on a motor car or else use the train. 
 The station is just 5 minutes walk    
 from the western edge of the D-block  
 and is on the main line from Ashford  
 to London Victoria.                   
     Most people in the village do     
 their shopping in Maidstone or        
 Sittingbourne and a lot of people     
 commute to London each day to work, a 
 journey of approximately 80 minutes on
 the train.                            
     Children who live up on the Downs 
 are brought to school each day by     
 mini-bus  and the older children      
 attending Swadelands School in Lenham 
 travel by coach which picks them up   
 outside the primary school each day.  </content>
