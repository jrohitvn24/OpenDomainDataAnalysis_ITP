		<title>07BARFORD ST. MARTIN SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  I go to a school called Barford St.  
 Martin First School. It is rather     
 small but I like it. It was built in  
 1854. We have two classes. We have 43 
 children in the whole school. In the  
 Infant class there are 19 children    
 under 7 and in the Junior class there 
 are 19 children aged 7 to 9.          
  We have two playgrounds, one of them 
 has a train in it and the other has a 
 climbing frame with a slide. We can   
 play in the school garden in the      
 summer. We have a playing field near  
 the school.                           
  We have three teachers. Two are here 
 all the time and one comes one day a  
 week.                                 
  Most of the children live in Barford,
 but some do not live in the village   
 and come on the coach.
