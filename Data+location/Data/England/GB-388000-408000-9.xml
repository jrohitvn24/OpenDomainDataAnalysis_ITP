		<title>09LIVING IN ROCHDALE</title>
		<content>      I live in a terraced house in    
 Osborne Street, in Deeplish, which is 
 a part of Rochdale. I live with my    
 brother, my dog and my parents. The   
 best place in my house is my bedroom  
 which has a computer in it.           
      There is a factory in front of my
 house with a big garden around it.    
 That is private land. There are trees 
 in front og our house blocking the    
 view of the ugly factory.             
      To the left of our house are some
 public playing fields with a park next
 to them. I usually play soccer on the 
 fields, but they are not like the     
 gardens of the factory, which are soft
 and cushion you when you fall. I think
 it is not fair, not letting me and my 
 friends play in the grounds of the    
 factory.
