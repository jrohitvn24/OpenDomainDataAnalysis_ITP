      The River Thames is very popular 
 for cruising,fishing,canoeists,       
 sailing,swimming and walking.         
                                       
      Some of the most common fish are 
 Barbel,Bleat,Chub,Carp,Minnow,Rudd,   
 Perch,Trout and Rainbow trout.        
                                       
      During our survey we observed the
 following birds: Canada Geese,Coot,   
 Heron,Mallard,Mute swan,Great Crested 
 Grebe,Pied Wagtail,Cormorant and Reed 
 Bunting.                              
                                       
      The section of the River Thames  
 at Goring and Streatley is very wide. 
 About 250 metres and is crossed by a  
 bridge built in 1922 of concrete but  
 looks wooden. Many small cruisers,    
 which can be hired,pass under this    
 bridge.                               </content>
