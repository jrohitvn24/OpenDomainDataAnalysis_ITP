		<content> WHEN BUTLINS FIRST CAME TO MINEHEAD   
 THEY ASKED FOR 80,000 GALLONS OF WATER
 A DAY, AS BUTLINS GREW BIGGER THEY    
 ASKED FOR 240,000 GALLONS PER DAY.    
 THE SERVICES OF A GEOLOGIST AND A     
 WATER DIVINOR WERE ASKED FOR; FIRST   
 THEY FOUND WATER IN THE CAMP (UNDER   
 THE WATER TOWERS). THEN THEY FOUND IT 
 NEAR THE TOP OF NORTH HILL. IT WAS    
 FOUND THAT THE WATER FELL AS RAIN ON  
 THE HILLS OF SOUTH WALES AND PASSED   
 UNDER THE BRISTOL CHANNEL BETWEEN TWO 
 LAYERS OF NON-POROUS ROCK. THIS WATER 
 IS STAGNANT AND HAS TO BE AERATED     
 BEFORE IT CAN BE USED IN THE TOWN'S   
 WATER SUPPLY. THIS IS DONE BY PASSING 
 THE WATER THROUGH A NUMBER OF SIEVES. 
 THE PUBLIC ANALYST HAS CONFIRMED THAT 
 WATER HAS COME FROM WALES.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
