		<content>  {Paul May}and{Hayley Wadeson}both    
 live on{Yew Tree Hill}and when their  
 parents began to dig in their gardens 
 they discovered  lots of clay pipes,  
 bits of broken pottery and old coins  
 dating back to 1727. Also discovered  
 was a piece of jewellery and a silver 
 shaped heart with a bird on it.       
    Apparently the land was not just an
 ordinary field at all. A hundred years
 ago, or more, it used to be the place 
 where the village people held their   
 annual fair.                          
    There were children's roundabouts, 
 all pushed round by hand, side shows  
 and pottery stalls. We dont know for  
 sure, but perhaps people would bring  
 their produce like jams and pickles,  
 and probably chickens, with children  
 running, shouting and laughing. The   
 fair was held on the nearest Sunday to
 November 12th.                        </content>
