		<title>09ENTERTAINMENT SEAHOUSES</title>
		<content>  Although Seahouses depends so much on
 tourists for its income it is too     
 small to provide all the activities   
 found in larger seaside resorts. There
 is no cinema or theatre nor is there a
 swimming pool.                        
  The entertainments available are:    
 Three Amusement Arcades and Two Bingo 
 Halls which are permanent. During     
 the summer, Slater's Travelling Fair  
 visits the village for the whole of   
 the month of August bringing the Big  
 Wheel, Octopus and similar rides      
 together with side shows.             
  Also during the school holiday period
 there is a BEACH MISSION which        
 provides entertainment on the sands   
 every morning for the children.
