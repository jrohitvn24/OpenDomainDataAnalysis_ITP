		<content>     Also on the ground floor there is 
 a bathroom and toilet, a kitchen and a
 small room which I use for doing my   
 Husband's office work in.Lots of      
 houses now have central heating but we
 do not. We have just about an acre of 
 land surrounding the property. Most of
 this is laid down to grass with a few 
 flower beds and a vegetable patch.    
   Also in our family we have three    
 dogs called Toby,Tess and Bruce; two  
 cats called Twinkle and Tucker and two
 rabbits called Misty and Thumper.     
   My husband is a Chartered Building  
 Surveyor and is self-employed. He has 
 his office in Ashford High Street and 
 I work for my husband doing           
 administration work at home.
