		<content> Evidence of ancient man's occupation  
 of the block is clearly visible.In the
 South-West corner is a Field System   
 including a steeply sided valley which
 is thought to have been a Roman       
 vineyard. In the South-East corner    
 near Belhuish there are three bowl    
 round barrow burial mounds, each      
 approximately 12 metres diameter and  
 0.3 metre high.                       
 Marley Wood, in the North-East corner 
 is an ancient wood planted by the     
 Romans or Saxons. It was possibly     
 originally used for coppicing Ash.    
 In the South-East corner near Burngate
 Farm are the remains of a house known 
 as Mount Poynings. This was built     
 between 1540 and 1544 by Thomas       
 Poynings (who owned the Lulworth      
 Estate) using stone from the former   
 Bindon Abbey near Wool.
