		<title>05ROA ISLAND "WATCHTOWER"</title>
		<content>  The area of Roa Island was obviously 
 seen,in the past,as a possible        
 smuggler's haven because in 1849 a    
 Customs House was built here          
 overlooking Piel Deepwater channel.In 
 fact this Customs post had been on    
 Piel Island until 1760,then it was    
 moved to Ulverston,coming back to Piel
 by 1849.                              
 The Customs House contains a boat     
 house from where the local customs    
 officer could sail out into the       
 channel,board the boats and check     
 their cargo.As the iron ore trade     
 declined then the Customs House passed
 into the hands of Roa Island Mission  
 who held services there on every 2nd  
 Sunday.The "watch Tower"is now        
 disused,all its windows being bricked 
 /concreted up.
