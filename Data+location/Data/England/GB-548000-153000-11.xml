		<title>11 Stormont Garage</title>
		<content>On the 10th of July we went to Stormont
garage where we interviewed a car sales
representative. He said that there were
four other Stormont Garages in Kent. At
the garage they employ 32 staff and    
they service about twelve and a half   
thousand cars a year with very few     
complaints. They sell tyres but they   
don't make them. The most popular car  
they sell is the Escort and then the   
Orion and the cheapest car is the      
Fiesta Popular. One third of the cars  
in Sevenoaks are Ford. The most        
expensive piece of equipment is a      
hoist. They sell 95 different second   
hand cars. They have a car wash and    
they test all the second hand cars they
sell at Otford Road. They also store   
information about car sales on         
computer.
