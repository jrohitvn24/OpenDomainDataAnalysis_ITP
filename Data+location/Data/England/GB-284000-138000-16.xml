		<title>16An Exmoor Gymkhana</title>

 There are quite a lot of gymkhanas    
 held throughout the summer.There are  
 shows,show jumping,gymkhana work and  
 childrens sports.At the shows there   
 are rules,like no sticks in gymkhana  
 work,no galloping across the field and
 the judges decision is final.The      
 judges ask how old the ponies are and 
 their names.The prizewinners are given
 different coloured rosettes.Mrs.Vigars
 is organising a show at Honeymead to  
 help raise money for the school       
 swimming pool.                        
          I enjoy the shows a lot.     
 Once I came home with four cups,one   
 for the leading rein,two for the      
 champion and one for walk and trot in 
 the gymkhana. My pony is very used to 
 show work,so she always keeps calm and
 does well.
