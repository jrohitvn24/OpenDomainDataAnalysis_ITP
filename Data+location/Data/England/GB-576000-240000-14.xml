		<title>14PRESERVED WOODLAND</title>
		<content>  The{woods}are especially beautiful in
 spring when there is a carpet of      
 bluebells and primroses. Years ago    
 people used to visit the woods but    
 they are{not open to the public}now   
 because people brought dogs which     
 killed the wild life, and some people 
 even started digging up wild flowers. 
  There are a few{deer}in the woods but
 they can destroy crops and damage     
 trees so the farmers do not like them,
 also the{foxhunters}dislike deer      
 because the hounds chase them instead 
 of the foxes.                         
  In the winter there is quite a lot of
{industry}in the woods. The farmer cuts
 firewood, fencing posts, bean poles   
 and peasticks.{Thatchers}come from    
 Chelmsford and Nayland to cut hazel   
 twigs to make bauches to hold the     
 thatch in place, and to make the      
 attractive patterns on thatched roofs.</content>
