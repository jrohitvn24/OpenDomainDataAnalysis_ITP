		<title>12North Weald School</title>
		<content> At North Weald Primary school in      
 February 1985, there was a fire. It   
 was caused by the school swimming pool
 pump over heating. It set one class on
 fire and the rest of the damage was   
 done by smoke and water from the      
 firemans' hoses.                      
 In 1678, a man called Simon Thargood, 
 who was a fishmonger, left fifty      
 pounds in his will for the church to  
 build a schoolroom for the children of
 North Weald. Since then there has only
 been 3 school buildings. They are all 
 still in existence. The first one is  
 next to the church and still used as a
 sunday school. The second one is      
 Wylding Tree farm. This was used in   
 the 2nd world war as the church school
 was too near the airfield. The third  
 school is the one we work in today.
