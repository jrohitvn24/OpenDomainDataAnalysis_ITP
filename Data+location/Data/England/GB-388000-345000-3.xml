		<title>03THE MEDIEVAL SLABS OF HANLEY</title>
		<content>In medieval Hanley there was an old    
open market near to St John's Church.  
There were long pathways joining Hanley
to other villages.When it was raining  
the pathways got very muddy when the   
horses,peddlars and monks walked on    
them,so the people put stone slabs on  
the paths.Some are still there now.The 
market near to St John's Church had    
pack horses to carry the goods which   
had to be sold.The pathway joined      
Hanley market and led to Cobridge and  
Tunstall markets.The slab pathways were
built on high ground to protect the    
people using them.They could walk and  
look out for robbers and murderers who 
might attack them.                     
A lot of the old buildings have been   
knocked down now, but St John's Church 
is old.In fact it is the oldest        
building standing in Hanley today.
