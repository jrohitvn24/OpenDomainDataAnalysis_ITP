		<content> Many legends and stories are told     
 about the chalk downs, and it is said 
 that there is even a possibility that 
 our most traditional game - that of   
 English Cricket - could have          
 originated on the chalk downs.        
 The wicket - or wicket gate at the    
 entrance to a sheep-fold - and the    
 local shepherds who used to practise  
 defending it with their crooks.       
 Attackers would bowl stones at the    
 defender who  would hit them away with
 the curve of their crooks.            
 Old Wiltshire villagers were convinced
 that hedgehogs sucked milk from cows  
 lying in the meadows. They also swore 
 that they visited orchards and carried
 off apples on their spines.           
 Should a magpie perch on a roof, it   
 signified that the roof was sound: No 
 tree used by a magpie would ever be   
 uprooted by the wind.                 </content>
