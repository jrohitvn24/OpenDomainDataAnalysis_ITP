  A normal day for J3 begins with      
K.M.P. Everyone does their own work    
from special Maths cards. Then there is
assembly and the rest of the morning   
is spent doing Maths and English.      
  There is a twenty minute break       
halfway through the  morning. At 12.00 
we stop for lunch then go out to       
play.                                  
  Afternoon school begins at 1.15.     
Sometimes we have P.E., Art or a story.
We also have environmental studies.    
  At times during the year we go on    
educational visits. This year J3 went  
on visits to Greenwich Maritime Museum,
Tenterden Steam Railway and bird       
watching at Rye Harbour Nature Reserve.
We also took part in a musical event   
called Project Apollo.
