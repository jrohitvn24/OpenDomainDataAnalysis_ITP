		<content> 1.{Bulldog}                           
    This is a game for any number of   
 players. You need quite a lot of      
 space. One person stands in the middle
 facing the others. When he shouts     
 "Bulldog",everyone tries to run to the
 other side. The person in the middle  
 has to catch them. If you are caught, 
 then you must help catch the rest.    
 When everyone has been caught,the     
 person who was caught first is in the 
 middle,and you start a new game.      
 2.{French skipping }                  
    This is for 3 or more players. Rope
 or wool is tied around 2 people       
 standing 2 metres apart.The others    
 jump,one at a time: in, out, in, ON,  
 in, out, turn around, in and out. If  
 you stand on the rope you are out and 
 another person has a go.
