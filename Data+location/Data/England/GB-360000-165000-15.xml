		<title>15Homeopathy</title>
		<content> Dr.Hughes-Games came to school to talk
 about homeopathy.This is a medical    
 system which engages "like to cure    
 like".Homeopathy is derived from the  
 greek. (HOMIOS = like: PATHOS         
 =suffering).Our bodies are like       
 fortresses with men_at_arms at all    
 times ready to fight the enemy.       
 Homeopathy really started with a      
 German, Dr.Hahnemann.In 1970 he was   
 experimenting with quinine as a cure  
 for malaria.He gave his friends doses 
 of quinine and discovered that they   
 developed the same symptons as        
 malaria.A cure for sore thoats is said
 to be made from bella donna.What you  
 do is crush up a particular plant     
 with alcohol and water.What you get is
 called "mother tincture".Then you take
 one drop of this mixture and dilute it
 in 100 drops of water and alcohol.You 
 do this 6 times to make it strength 6.</content>
