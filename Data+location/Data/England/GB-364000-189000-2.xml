		<content> Milbury Heath is a small community of 
 one farm and twenty seven private and 
 council houses. The only shop is a    
 post office as the general store      
 closed ten years ago.Bread and milk   
 are delivered, all other shopping     
 being done in Thornbury and Bristol.  
 There is no gas. Water and electricity
 were installed thirty years ago.      
 Before this the village pump and oil  
 lamps were used. About eighty people, 
 including four children live in the   
 village. Four people work at Rolls    
 Royce and three at the Garden Centre. 
 Most villagers are retired. People    
 need cars as there is no bus service  
 nearer than the A38. The amenities are
 a public telephone, a pub and the     
 Garden Centre. The old chapel is now  
 used for storage. Most villagers like 
 to live in Milbury Heath because it is
 quiet and peaceful.                   </content>
