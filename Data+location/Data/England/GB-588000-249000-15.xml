		<content>Near the Guildhall,an overhanging house
has horizontal shutters,which show it  
was originally a Tudor shop.The pink   
house at the junction of Market Lane   
and High Street shows clearly the      
wooden pegs used to hold the timbers   
together.Pegging was done on the       
ground;on Raising Day,everyone helped  
to push the timbers into place. Marks  
of the props which held up the timbers 
can still be seen. A bishop's mitre is 
carved on the wall of the Swan Hotel.  
Bishop Blaise,patron saint of wool-    
traders,is said to have been martyred  
by having his flesh combed off. 7 Lady 
Street,a Tudor building with 17th      
century additions was once a shop and  
has a long room-the Solar-where the    
mistress of the house supervised her   
woolworkers.There is a fine example of 
a Crown or King Post-a collection of   
timber posts to hold up the roof.      </content>
