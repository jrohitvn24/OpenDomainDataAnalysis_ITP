		<title>10**********Ballet************</title>
		<content>Ballet is on Monday and Thursday       
night.It costs me 60p. for             
three-quarters an hour. On Monday      
night there are three lessons and on   
Thursday there are two. There are      
about 36 children who go ballet. On    
Monday the times are from 6.15p.m.to   
6.45.for the first lesson, then the    
next lesson starts at 6.45p.m. to      
7.30.p.m. and the last lesson at       
7.30to 8.15.Some of our dads           
complained so now it is 8.o'clock. We  
have ballet in the chapel. We would    
like to do bar work, but we haven't    
got a bar. We are now working for an   
exam. for Grade 2. Last year we put on 
a concert for people to come and see,  
and this year we are going to put on a 
concert again.
