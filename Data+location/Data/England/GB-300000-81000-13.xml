		<title>13A Devon Dairy Farm</title>
		<content> The{Dairy Farm}we went to visit       
 is Liverton Farm.It is situated about 
 a kilometre from Exmouth just off     
 the main road to Budleigh Salterton.Mr
 Ellett is the farmer there and he     
 manages about 1 square kilometer and a
 half of land.Everyday he has to milk  
 the cows,then an{Express Dairy}milk   
 tanker comes and takes the milk to    
{Honiton}where it might go on to       
{Taunton}or stay in Honiton to be made 
 into butter.                          
   The products Express Dairies make   
 out of the{Milk}are Butter,           
 Cheese, Yogurts and Cream.            
   Mr Ellett also grows Wheat and      
 Barley and Grass for winter feed.Some 
 of the grass is dried out for hay and 
 some is made into silage.             
   There are many farms to the N and E 
 of Exmouth, but housing estates are   
 gradually taking over farm land.      </content>
