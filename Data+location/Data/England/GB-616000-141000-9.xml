		<title>09MISS SMITH</title>
		<content> Miss Smith has lived in Elham since   
 1904; her house is called King Post   
 and was built in C15, it is so named  
 because of the King Post holding the  
 house together.                       
 There were three classes at Elham     
 School, with an age range of 5-14     
 years. If you passed the scholarship  
 you went to the Grammar School in     
 Canterbury. Travel to Canterbury was  
 by the Elham Valley Railway, which no 
 longer exists. There were no school   
 dinners, you either take your lunch or
 went home for it. In 1945 there were  
 at least 14 shops in Elham and now    
 there are five.                       
 Hog Green, now a housing estate, used 
 to be a green where villagers kept    
 their pigs(hogs). In 1947 the Elham   
 Valley Railway closed down. The King  
 Post used to be the Post Office, until
 1944.                                 </content>
