		<content>{A scenic area}with panoramic views    
 from Carlton Bank over a patchwork of 
 grass and arable fields, westward to  
 the distant Pennines, northward to the
 heights of Durham, and backed on south
 and east by moorland broken up by     
 river valleys. There are no stone     
 walls; hedges divide the fields. In   
 the centre lies the village of{Faceby.
{Whorl Hill}and the lower slopes of the
 escarpment are covered by managed     
 plantations, mixed and coniferous.    
 There are smaller wooded areas, and   
 some fine trees in parkland at Faceby 
 Manor.{Carlton Bank,}scene of former  
 alum and sandstone quarry workings, is
 scarred by motor cyclists and over-use
 of three long-distance walks which    
 cross the area. Conspicuous along the 
 hillside and on pasture land on Whorl 
 Hill are the spoil heaps of burnt jet 
 shale, reddish brown in colour.       </content>
