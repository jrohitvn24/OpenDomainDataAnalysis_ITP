		<title>01SUMMARY OF STUDY AREA</title>
		<content> The area being studied is principally 
 rural. The major settlement is the    
 village of Send, a ribbon settlement  
 along the Woking/Dorking road, which  
 has expanded with new estates in the  
 Send Marsh and Send Hill areas. A     
 small shopping parade caters for the  
 basic local needs and two bus services
 connects Send with the shopping       
 centres of Woking (5km) and Guildford 
 (9km) and a nearby service goes to    
 London. Sutton Green is an isolated   
 hamlet with few local amenities and   
 only one local bus service to Woking  
 and Guildford. The church is situated 
 away from the village on Send Hill.   
 Most of the study area is farmed,     
 principally dairy cattle grazing on   
 intensively managed grassland. The    
 River Wey Navigation flows through the
 area in a south/north direction       
 towards the River Thames at Weybridge.</content>
