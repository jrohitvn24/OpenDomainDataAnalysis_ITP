		<title>02A HILL FARM AT WILLSTONE</title>
		<content>                                       
   Willstone Farm has been owned by one
 family for 63 years.It comprises 700  
 acres which include Caradoc Hill,459m,
 Little Caradoc,Robin's Tump and the   
 Wilderness.The steep slopes make      
 cultivation difficult even with a 4-  
 wheel drive tractor. In 1984 the      
 Wilderness and Robin's Tump were      
 cultivated for the first time and were
 transformed from an area of wild      
 bracken,brambles and thorn bushes,into
 good grazing land.                    
   To help us check on the cattle and  
 sheep scattered over the hillside,we  
 have a 3-wheel motorbike,and this has 
 made our lives a little easier.       
 Progress indeed. Winter snow and      
 blizzards are a hazard in such a hilly
 terrain.
