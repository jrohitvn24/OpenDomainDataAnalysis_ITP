		<title>11COUNTRY PARK</title>
		<content> Yateley Country Park is Hampshire's   
 largest common, a mere fragment of the
 heather moor it once was. It now      
 covers 493 acres, entrusted to        
 Hampshire C.C. The other 1200 acres of
 heathland are taken up by Blackbushe  
 Airport and Forestry Commission       
 plantation. The woodlands, the water  
 areas, the gorse and heather provide a
 good territory for bird watchers and a
 wide variety of birds can be seen     
 including the Dartford Warbler and    
 Hobby.Careful conservation and        
 education by a team of wardens ensures
 that both the common and rare plants, 
 birds,fishes and insects are          
 preserved. Badger setts have been here
 for over 150 years and deer can often 
 be seen and several ponds provide a   
 variety of wildlife and are used for  
 coarse fishing.
