		<content>  Beckington  is  an  historic  village
 situated  on the main road  in a rural
 area three miles from  Frome. It still
 maintains  a  community   spirit   and
 village  atmosphere  with  the Village
 Hall,  church  and  school playing  an
 important part in village life.       
  Beckington   grew  up  and  prospered
 because  of its position on one of the
 early main roads which ran from London
 to Southampton and on to Bristol. When
 the New  World was opened up this road
 became particularly important.        
  Beckington flourished.  Later wealthy
 wool   merchants   found    Beckington
 ideally  situated for their trade. Now
 Frome   is   the   market   town   and
 Beckington has become a village.      
  Three  main roads now run through the
 village and the volume, size and speed
 of  modern traffic makes living in the
 village difficult.                    </content>
