		<content>  In the South East unemployment is    
 not such a problem as elsewhere in the
 country and this is reflected in      
 the fact that almost all the fathers  
 in our survey had a job. About half of
 the men work locally, including       
 Burnham, Maldon Southend and          
 Chelmsford, but a substantial number  
 commute to London by train.           
  Only just over half of the mothers   
 had a job and by far the greatest     
 number of these work in Southminster  
 itself.                               
  There is an estate of some nine      
 factories for light industrial use and
 this employs about 300 people.        
  The Power Station at Bradwell is the 
 biggest single employer in the area.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
