		<content> Netherhall school is the second       
 biggest in the county of Cumbria.It   
 has the best science,music and        
 language blocks.It educates 1100      
 pupils and offers subjects ranging    
 from cookery to computing.            
 As a pupil I enjoy school.I take      
 German and French as a form of        
 language.These languages are optional 
 in the 4th year.Ialso take            
 science,home                          
 economics,geography,maths,english,art,
 and history.I enjoy history the most  
 because reading about the Romans is   
 interesting.                          
 Netherhall is full of                 
 nightlife.Classes are often held after
 school,such as clubs etc.The drama    
 dept. always organize different kinds 
 of dramas and productions.            
 Netherhall on the whole is a very     
 educatioal and enjoyable school.      </content>
