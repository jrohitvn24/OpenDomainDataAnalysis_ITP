		<content> The block covered by Haughton &amp; Dist. 
 W.I.is a very small farming community.
 The area is basically intensive grass,
 used to produce silage and hay for    
 grazing dairy cattle.  Of the 295 head
 of population, 49 are under the age of
 16, 160 between the ages of 16 - 50   
 and 86 over the age of 50.  There are 
 107 houses and one flat built over the
 top of a large garage.  The majority  
 of the houses are detached and where  
 they are semi-detached are in no more 
 than blocks of four. Council owned    
 property amounts to approx. 10 houses 
 the rest split almost equally between 
 owner occupied and tenanted. Of the   
 tenanted property about 6 are farms   
 owned by one landlord. Even in 1985 at
 least three of the houses have no     
 inside or outside lavatories, although
 Council grants are available to       
 provide them.                         </content>
