		<content> Cookridge is not a working place but a
 dormitory for Leeds. It has grown to  
 be as large as it is because it is    
 only 5 miles from the centre of Leeds 
 where thousands of people work. This  
 discovery was the result of a survey  
 covering all the parents of the older 
 children in our school.

 We found that most fathers work in    
 other parts of Leeds and those who    
 work outside Yorkshire usually had    
 their main office in Leeds. Most      
 mothers only work part time and as    
 near as possible to Cookridge.
