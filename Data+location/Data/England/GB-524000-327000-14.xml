		<content>      .......Matthew Jackson (age 11). 
      "Up at about 7.00 a.m., I washed 
 ready for breakfast.  The school taxi 
 arrived, driven by Mr. Towers.  At    
 school, Mr. Hall showed us a problem  
 page that took most of the morning.   
 English, Maths and Spelling.  A big   
 spelling test came before lunch.  I   
 was glad to hear the lunch bell.      
      When I got home I was put in     
 charge of the tea.  It did not go too 
 well.  I put the cooker on without any
 meat, so we settled for fish fingers  
 and chips.                            
      That night, after a lot of       
 rehearsals, it was the real thing -The
 Scouts 1985 Gang Show.  Makeup was put
 on our faces and in no time it was all
 finished.                             
      After all that,I was glad to get 
 my head down for the night.  All I    
 could think of was school next day."  </content>
