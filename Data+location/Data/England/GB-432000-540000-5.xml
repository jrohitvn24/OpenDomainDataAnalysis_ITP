		<title>05FARMING PATTERNS</title>
		<content> Five farms in the area have been      
 studied.By some standards all are     
 small,the largest has an area of 321  
 hectacres and the smallest of the     
 group is 81 hectacres.The names of the
 families are Gibson,Gibson,Gilchrist, 
 Dixon,Leymour.All of the families in  
 the group have been working the same  
 farm for 60 years and now the second  
 and third generations are incumbents. 
 With the exception of the largest     
 farm, Gibsons, all keep beef          
 cattle for fattening and grow mixed   
 crops,corn,potatoes,turnips and a new 
   crop oil seed rape.The  largest farm
 grows wheat,barley,oats and  oil seed 
 rape.All these crops are sold.On the  
 smaller farms some crops such as      
 potatoes,turnips and grass are grown  
 to feed the beef cattle.
