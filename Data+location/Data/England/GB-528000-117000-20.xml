		<content>    The Domesday work for this block is
 the result of co_operation between two
 schools.{Southway Junior}have acted as
 the data collectors, with{St.Wilfid's 
{RC Primary}acting as a feeder.        
    Initial discussions were held to   
 share the block into two halves for   
 data collection and in sharing the    
 topic matter.The{kilometre squares    
 A to F were covered by Southway, G to 
 L by St.Wilfrid's. Southway's work was
 by two 4th Year classes with Mr.Hair &amp;
 Mrs.Tilbury, St.Wilfrid's with 2nd,3rd
 &amp; 4th years led by Mrs.Jewell.        
  {Pages}3,4,5,7,11,12 &amp; 16 are largely
 Southway; 2,6,10,13,14,15, &amp; 17,      
 St.Wilfrids, the remainder are a      
 combination arranged by Andrew Hair.  
 The{photos and captions}are also his  
 and were taken in July 1985. In that  
 month the 160 children involved went  
 on a joint walk to Wolstonbury Hill.  </content>
