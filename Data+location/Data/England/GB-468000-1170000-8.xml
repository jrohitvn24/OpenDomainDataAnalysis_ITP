		<title>08LAMBING IN SKERRIES</title>
		<content> I love the lambing time of the year.  
 My daddy lambed one sheep and it had  
 twins. They were very poor. Grannie   
 had to take them in her house because 
 their mother did not lick them. If    
 they have not been licked it means the
 lambs might die because being licked  
 brings them to life.                  
   She looked after them. After a while
 they started  to walk so they went    
 back to their mummy to stay the night 
 in the barn. Then in the morning they 
 went in the yard and we went to see   
 them. One was lying with their mummy  
 and the other was lying beside a green
 tub. When we went up to the top of the
 yard to see them one came to meet us  
 and I was able to hold it.            
    They nearly died but they pulled   
 through. I love the lambing time.
