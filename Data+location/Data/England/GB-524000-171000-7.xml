		<title>07Asians Women's Dress</title>
		<content>After putting on her "chania choli",   
or blouse and long petticoat, a lady   
wraps her saree round her,rather like  
the toga of the ancient Romans.It may  
be of silk, satin, tissue or French    
chiffon.Sarees may be worn by anyone,  
and are very beautiful.Young girls do  
not wear sarees but a three piece suit 
called a "salwar kammeez". The "salwar"
is a long dress type garment with slits
at the sides.The"kameez" is like a pair
of trousers,often loose and baggy.     
Sometimes you can wear a "pyjama" with 
the "salwar".This is  tight fitting,   
unlike the "kameez".(A "pyjama" is not 
something you wear at night, but "py"  
means leg and "jama" means clothing).  
Mostly a kind of scarf is also worn,   
a two and a half yard length of        
material called a "dupatta", which is  
wound round the neck.
