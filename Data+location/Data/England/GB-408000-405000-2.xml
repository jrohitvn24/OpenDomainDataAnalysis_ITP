		<content> Holme and Holmebridge villages are    
 located in the lower lying eastern    
 area, some kilometers apart. Holme is 
 composed of traditional millstone grit
 cottages in which the domestic woollen
 trade was once carried on and is now a
 conservation area. Holmebridge is     
 larger and developed with Industrial  
 woollen trade and mills were in       
 production until recently. Five       
 reservoirs adjacent to the villages   
 are bordered by plantations of        
 conifers, the largest belonging to the
 Forestry Commision. Parking and       
 picknic areas have been provided for  
 visitors. The two main roads that rise
 from the Holme Valley to cross the    
 Pennines have steep gradients and     
 rain, mist and snow present problems  
 for travellers in the winter. Snow    
 lies for long periods and ice or      
 drifting snow closes these roads.     </content>
