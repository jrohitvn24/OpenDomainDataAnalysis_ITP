		<title>16ST.MARY'S CHURCH ORGAN</title>
		<content>{                                      
 During 1985, St. Mary's church organ  
 had to be restored. It had been{50    
{years}since it was last over-hauled.  
 Due to mechanical failure it was found
 that the leather, which made up the   
 bellows, had to be replaced, wiring   
 renewed and{1500 metal and wood pipes 
 had to be cleaned and restored.       
 During May 1985 the pipes had to be   
 re-tuned by the organ builders, Bishop
 and Son, London. The total cost has   
 been in excess of{Â£10,000.}The first  
 time the organ was played for the     
 public after its renovation was when  
{Gainford Choral Society}performed     
 Beethoven's Mass (in C major) which   
 proved to be, "a warm and spirited    
 performance". We look forward to      
 another{50 years}of organ music in our
 church.
