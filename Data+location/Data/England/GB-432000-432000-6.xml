		<content>    The 'Club', the Working Men's Club,
 is the centre of all social life of   
 the area.   The Steward and his wife  
 organise many outings and trips to the
 seaside and country.   They oversee   
 all the various sporting activities   
 that go on; football, cricket, darts, 
 snooker and of course fishing.   Many 
 youth teams are operated and boys and 
 girls are initiated into adult life   
 through their involvement with the    
 Club.   It is also  a social centre   
 where people meet and just chat, play 
 bingo and watch the many concerts and 
 'turns' that are put on.
