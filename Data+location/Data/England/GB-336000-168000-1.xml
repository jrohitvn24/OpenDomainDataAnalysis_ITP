		<content> In this area of the West end of       
 Clevedon almost 7.5sq.km is the       
 Bristol Channel including the         
{Blackstone Rocks}and mudland. 3.5     
 sq.km. is farmland.The farmland around
 is very flat.1 sq.km.is the{West End  
{of Cevedon. }In recent years there has
 been a lot of house building and new  
 facilities such as shops,a school and 
 a sports centre. Many people who live 
 here travel to {Bristol}to work but   
 now there are more jobs in Clevedon.  
  The{Bristol Channel}is not very nice 
 to swim in.It is used by Clevedon     
 Sailing Club and large ships going to{
{Avonmouth Docks.}                     
  We get very low tides in Clevedon.   
 Last year was the lowest tide for 50  
 years which was 14.7 metres.
