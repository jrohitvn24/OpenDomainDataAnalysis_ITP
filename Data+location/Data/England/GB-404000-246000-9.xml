		<title>09I live on a Caravan Site.</title>
		<content> I live on a caravan site which my     
 parents own.We have 6 acres of land   
 and one hundred vans on the site.They 
 don't belong to us they are all       
 privately owned.We have a 2 acre      
 playing field with a swing and        
 seesaw.We have a small shop which     
 my mum runs.The vans are static,but we
 can also have eighteen touring vans.We
 open in March and close in October.   
 In the close season you can only come 
 for day trips because of the snow.It  
 gets a bit boring sometimes in the    
 week because there is hardly any one  
 around.We have a van on the site      
 called the Mother's Union van which   
 people in the group can come and stay 
 in for a few weeks.All the vans       
 have a number and a letter like b5 or 
 d7 so they can be found easily.People 
 on our site go fishing,walking,boating
 or they sunbathe.                     </content>
