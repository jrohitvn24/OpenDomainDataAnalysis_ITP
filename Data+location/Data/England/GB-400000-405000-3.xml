		<content> The Pennine Way footpath crosses our  
 north-eastern corner over the boggy   
 moorland. The landscape is bleak, and 
 the ground underfoot is wet, with     
 several fords over Broadhead Moss.It  
 is a much-used path by hikers. Other  
 footpaths go up the hillside from both
 Greenfield &amp; Uppermill to Dick Hill &amp; 
 'Pots &amp; Pans', a group of stones said 
 to have been a Druidic altar, on the  
 southern boundary of this area. It is 
 visited by walkers, often with their  
 dogs, &amp; is a local landmark. After the
 1st. World War, a memorial was erected
 to commemorate the local men who died.
 A Service is held there on Remembrance
 Sundays.                              
 Much of Ravenstone Estate is not for  
 public access, but notable features   
 can be seen from the A635 road, such  
 as Adam's Cross, typical scree slopes 
 of Millstone Grit, &amp; the reservoirs.  </content>
