		<title>07WALDON FISH FARM</title>
		<content> The farm was established in 1981. It  
 supports a family of four. Markets    
 include farm gate sales, hotels,      
 restaurants, fish mongers and local   
 markets. Fry are purchased from a     
 hatchery on Exmoor. Rainbow trout are 
 native to Canada and do not breed in  
 Britain. Female brood fish are treated
 with male hormones thus producing milt
 also. Hence all fry are female. Fry   
 are grown in tanks, then race-ways    
 until one pound in weight (table      
 preference). Those in excess are      
 transferred to two man-made ponds (in 
 total 2 acres) for fishing purposes.  
 The density for this is 100 fish per  
 acre. Predators include heron,        
 magpies, kingfishers, mink and the    
 occasional poacher. Frogs, water      
 boatmen and dragonflies abound on the 
 ponds.
