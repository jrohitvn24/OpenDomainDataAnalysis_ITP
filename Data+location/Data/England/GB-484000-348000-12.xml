		<title>12FARMING IN THE CLAYPOLE AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
       There are sixteen farms of      
 various sizes in our block. Two of    
 them have small flocks of sheep and   
 some others a secondary interest in   
 pigs. There is one dairy farm and one 
 pig farm in Claypole. Half of the     
 farmers live in the villages and the  
 other half in outlying farmsteads.    
       Farm animals, with the exception
 of the one dairy herd, are rarely seen
 in the village street, a far cry from 
 yesteryear. More common sights are    
 huge tractors carrying various labour 
 saving implements and, during late    
 summer, the combine harvester.        
       Owing to the mechinisation in   
 farming methods few people are        
 required to work on the land so the   
 villages, especially Claypole, have   
 become dormitory areas serving Newark.
