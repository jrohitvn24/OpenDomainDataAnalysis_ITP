Ford. He has 2 leading firemen and 8   
men on the station, a crew of 11 men   
altogether and they are all part       
timers. Some men are allowed to go off 
work in emergencies.                   
The first records of a fire attended is
1878. The fire station is over 100     
yearsold. They originally  relied on   
horses to pull the fire engine, now    
they are as modren as any other fire   
service. There is going to be a new    
fire station in Saxmundham.            
The siren on the pole is controlled    
by the police and was used in the      
second world war. The fire station has 
an average of 160 calls a year. The    
furtherest they have gone is Thetford  
which is 106 miles there and back.The  
whole fire service is controlled by the
Ipswich fire station.The tank in todays
fire engine holds 450 galons of water. </content>
