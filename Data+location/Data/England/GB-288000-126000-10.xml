		<title>10Beating for the Shoot</title>
		<content>      Beating is a very good sport and 
 we do it with sticks,dogs and         
 guns.Usually there are two beaters and
 maybe ten people with guns,as well as 
 several dogs.The beaters each go to a 
 corner at the bottom of the wood.Three
 people with guns go to the left and to
 the right to the bottom of the        
 wood.The rest go to the top.          
      The beaters start tapping and the
 guns work there way down to the       
 bottom.As they go down,the dogs sniff 
 through the brambles and when the     
 pheasants fly out,the guns shoot      
 them.The beaters at the bottom keep   
 the pheasants facing the guns.
