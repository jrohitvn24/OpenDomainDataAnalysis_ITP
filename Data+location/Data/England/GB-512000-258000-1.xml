		<content> The block lies in the County of       
 Bedfordshire. It is 10 miles west of  
 the County town of Bedford, in the    
 valley of the River Great Ouse. There 
 are no villages in the block, to the  
 north lies the village of Podington,  
 to the south Harrold, to the east     
 Odell and to the west Bozeat, a       
 Northamptonshire village.             
 There is evidence of Roman settlement 
 in the area, and at Dungee Corner     
 there was a Roman road junction, of   
 roads from Bozeat and Irthlingborough.
 The area has only got 6 dwellings     
 within it, 3 of which are farmhouses  
 with industrial activities now being  
 carried out in the outbuildings. There
 is an industrial area and a drag      
 racing track, but most of the area is 
 arable farmland and woodland. This is 
 possibly the least inhabited area of  
 Bedfordshire.                         </content>
