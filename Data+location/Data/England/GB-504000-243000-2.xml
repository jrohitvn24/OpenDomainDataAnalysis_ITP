 Wilstead was probably an Anglo-Saxon  
 agricultural settlement based on the  
 fertile Bedfordshire clay soils.      
 Today Wilstead is a fairly large      
 village with ample shops and services 
 for local needs.  The older village   
 was linear in form and used to be cut 
 in two by the A6.  However a large    
 modern post war housing estate has    
 been established hiding the original  
 linear form.  The village is now      
 by-passed by the A6.  Although the    
 village has shops and services the    
 local people mainly shop in Bedford   
 for major goods.  Wilstead is a fairly
 large village with five public houses,
 a garage and a few shops situated     
 about five miles from Bedford.
