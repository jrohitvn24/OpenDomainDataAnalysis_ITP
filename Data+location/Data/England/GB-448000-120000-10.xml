		<content> The main social centre of the village 
 is the 90 year old Village Hall.      
 Although inconveniently situated on   
 the eastern side of the busy main road
 in the village,the Hall is in daily   
 use by the numerous village           
 organisations.However,fire regulations
 limit the capacity to 90 people and   
 this is no longer adequate for the    
 growing needs of the village.The      
 Village Association has begun the     
 first moves towards the funding of a  
 new community centre which will be    
 sited nearer the physical centre of   
 the village.It is hoped that this will
 provide better meeting facilities,    
 particularly for the young people of  
 the village,a sports area and,        
 possibly,facilities for a doctor's    
 surgery - something which the village 
 at present lacks.
