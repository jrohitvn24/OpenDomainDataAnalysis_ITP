		<title>07THE COLYTON FEOFFEES</title>
		<content>  The Feoffees are members of a charity
 which has contributed much to Colyton 
 in the past. It all started when Henry
 Courtney, a cousin of Henry VIII, was 
 convicted and beheaded for treason in 
 1539. He was Lord of the Manor of     
 Colyton and his land was confiscated  
 by the King. Some merchants sent a    
 petition to Henry VIII to buy back the
 land and he granted their request.    
 They were the first Feoffees. The rent
 from the land and property was used to
 help the poor including founding the  
 Grammar School.                       
  Nowadays, the Feoffees cannot help   
 out as much as they used to. In 1920, 
 they sold all their land to make money
 for charity and to build a Feoffees   
 Town Hall. If a person has a serious  
 accident, they might give him a grant.
 In February they hold a banquet to    
 celebrate the giving of the charter.  </content>
