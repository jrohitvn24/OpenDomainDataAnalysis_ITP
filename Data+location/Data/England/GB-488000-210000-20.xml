		<content>    At 7.30 the caretaker opens up the 
 school. Then the teachers start to    
 arrive at about 8.00. At 8.40 the     
 children start to arrive. The teacher 
 comes out at 9.00 and blows the       
 whistle and the children go in. When  
 they go into the classroom the        
 register is called and they go into   
 assembly. The Headmaster plays some   
 music and we sing two hymns. Then it  
 is maths groups. We then have playtime
 and the boys play football or cricket 
 , and the girls just talk. After play 
 it is science we study trees and      
 animals.It is lunch time at 12.00 and 
 we come in at 1.15. It is silent      
 reading until 1.30. Then it is art    
 and craft where woodwork, sewing,     
 pottery and sketching are done. We    
 have last play at 2.30 and when we    
 come in we continue with art and      
 craft. We go home at 3.45.            </content>
