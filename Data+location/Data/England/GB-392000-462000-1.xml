		<title>01BORDLEY BECK DRAINAGE GROUND</title>
		<content> Part of the Mid-Craven Fault where the
 underlying geological strata is often 
 exposed. Limestone outcrops break     
 through the thin layer of fine turf   
 across the north of the area which is 
 well drained. Bordley Beck flows in an
 approximate north-south direction with
 feeder streams coming off the steep   
 slopes on either side. These expose   
 shales and gritstones in the gulleys. 
 High ground south of the limestone is 
 usually wet with a covering of poor,  
 acidic vegetation. Lower slopes       
 towards Bordley Beck have been drained
 and fertilised to provide hay, silage 
 and grazing for sheep and cattle upon 
 which the farming economy is based.   
 Numerous tracks radiate from the tiny 
 settlement of Bordley at the northern 
 extremity of the area leading to farms
 and larger villages some miles away.  
 All the farms have electricity and    </content>
