		<title>16Friday is my Favourite Day</title>
		<content> My name is Mark Haynes,I am 9 years   
 old and go to Hanley Swan Primary     
 School.My favourite day is Friday.    
 I get up at approximately 7:30a.m.and 
 have breakfast, either Cornflakes,    
 or Weetabix.I say goodbye to Dad as he
 goes to work,then play with my        
 scalextric until it is time to walk to
 school.I am usually the first there,  
 and I play in the playground telling  
 the boys and girls last night's news. 
 When the bell rings we go to assembly 
 and on Friday the Vicar comes to take 
 the service. Lessons are usually maths
 and english and an exciting BBC T.V.  
 programme called "Look and Read".We   
 bring sandwiches as there is no school
 meal service.I have four sandwiches,a 
 cake and a chocolate biscuit.After    
 there is time to play football before 
 making models in craft lesson in the  
 afternoon.                            </content>
