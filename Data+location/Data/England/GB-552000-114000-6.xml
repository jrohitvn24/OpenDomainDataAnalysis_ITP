		<title>06Mr.Austen's Day At Work</title>
		<content> I get up at 6.0a.m. I take my two Jack
 Russells for a walk. Then I have my   
 breakfast and at 7.30a.m. I go to     
 work. I work in the butcher's shop run
 by Mr.A.Blaber. My first job is to    
 check that the refrigerator is working
 properly. Then I put the meat in the  
 window display. I make sausages every 
 other day. The rest of the day is     
 spent preparing joints of meat and    
 serving customers. Very often there is
 a delivery lorry which brings fresh   
 supplies of meat bought at the local  
 markets. I have to check the right    
 quantity has been delivered. At about 
 4.0p.m. the unsold meat in the window 
 display is returned to the coldstore. 
 The work surfaces, mincer, bacon      
 slicer and sausage machine all have to
 be scrubbed clean. At 5.30p.m. I lock 
 the shop up and return home to my wife
 and two children for dinner &amp; a rest. </content>
