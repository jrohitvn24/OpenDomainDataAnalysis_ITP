  A MIXED FARM IN THURSTON             
                                       
  We went to Manor Farm.First we saw a 
10 month old bull,then we saw a herd of
Friesian cows and one bull.The cows are
fed on straw in winter and grass in    
summer and spring.                     
  We saw machines such as a sprayer,and
a straw-cutter,and a plough with ten   
blades.                                
  We saw where the cattle are          
milked;they sometimes have oats while  
when they are milked.First,the udders  
are cleaned with a hosepipe,then the   
suction cups are put on.               
 In the morning the farmworkers get up 
between 5:30 and 7:30 and work until   
6:30 or 8:30pm.                        
  We saw some chickens,quail,and red   
and black turkeys.The farm grows peas, 
oilseed rape,and cereals on 400 acres. </content>
