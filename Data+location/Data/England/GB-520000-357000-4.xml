		<title>04BATTLE OF BRITAIN FLIGHT</title>
		<content> The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight 
 was started in 1957 at RAF Biggin     
 Hill and transferred to RAF Coningsby 
 in {1976}after being at Coltishall,   
 Cottesmore and Scampton.It is composed
 of {5 Spitfires and 2 Hurricanes and  
{the only surviving Lancaster bomber   
{still flying.}                        
 One permanent officer and twelve vol- 
 unteers run the Flight,the pilots all 
 flying Phantom and Tornado jets as    
 their normal work.Because the aircraft
 making up the flight are obsolete any 
 spare parts for the Merlin and Gryphon
 engines which may be needed are       
 specially made by {Rolls Royce}at     
{Derby.}The Flight is financed from the
 Air Defence Budget and is active on   
 most summer weekends on 'fly pasts' at
 social events up and down the country 
 as a memorial to the airmen who lost  
 their lives in World War II.          </content>
