		<content> West Town Farm, a small 2 acre farm,  
 has been run by one family for 48     
 years and has been known by this name 
 for 14 years.                         
 4 people work full-time and there are 
 2 part-timers. They keep 3,000 pigs   
 including 300 sows and 7 boars which  
 are fed a mixture of barley, wheat and
 fishmeal.                             
 A sow has its first litter at about 11
 months and she usually has 2-3 litters
 in a year.  There are 8-19 in a       
 litter, the average being 10. 100     
 piglets are kept for breeding but most
 are sent for slaughter at 20 weeks of 
 age, when they weigh about 180 lbs.   
 They fetch about Â£60.                 
 There is also a "pick your own" area  
 growing goosberries,blackcurrants and 
 raspberries.
