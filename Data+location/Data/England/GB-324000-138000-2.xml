		<content> I am Jo Grant,age 10.I like reading   
 books.I have a lot of books like the  
 Secret Seven and the Famous Five.I    
 also have a book that is called All   
 The Stories By C.S.Lewis.In that book 
 there are stories called Alice in     
 Wonderland,Alice Through The Looking  
 Glass and Silva and Bruno, and he     
 wrote                                 
 a lot of poems.Sometimes the poems are
 very long like 20 verses. I enjoy     
 books                                 
 very much because I like reading so I 
 can find out new things that I did not
 know.
