 life,"Yeovil has changed a lot"she    
 said.From what she said,the town      
 centre has changed most,where the new 
 round_abouts are in town there used to
 be shops and where the{Dual           
{Carriageway}is there used to be a park
 and the old{Maternity Unit.           
  She attended the old Westfield School
 and could remember some teachers who  
 still teach there.                    
  When asked about the Housing         
 Development in the area where,she     
 lives,Mrs.Fitch said,"I don't mind,   
 people have to have somewhere to      
 live."                                
  Mrs.Fitch has had a number of jobs in
 cleaning and before those she worked  
 in a shoe and gloving works which has 
 since moved from the area.At the      
 moment she is a housewife,looking     
 after her two children and husband.   </content>
