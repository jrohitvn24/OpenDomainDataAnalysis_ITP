		<title>16A SOCIAL CONCERN, GRIMSBY</title>
		<content> Walking down{Church Lane,Old Clee,}I  
 felt as if I was in a small village.It
 was very quiet,only{1 car}passed in{an
{hour}but{5 horses}went by to{Old Clee 
{Riding School.}Clee is now{part of the
{town.}Houses surround it on 3 sides.On
 the west there are sports fields and{2
{small meadows}where horses graze.Local
 people{fought}to{protect}this pretty  
 area after houses were built close to 
 the ancient church.Unusual Dutch{gable
{cottages}are{protected.}Some have been
 carefully modernised and enlarged.They
 were built about 1850 by{the Thorold's
{of Weelsby Hall.}They copied the style
 of{17C Clee Hall.}It was built about  
 1600. They{still farm}but only{own 5  
{acres}now. They have{tried}to{build}on
 the land{without}success. The{horse   
{fields}aren't in the area. We{fear}   
 they might be built on and spoil the  
 rural atmosphere.                     </content>
