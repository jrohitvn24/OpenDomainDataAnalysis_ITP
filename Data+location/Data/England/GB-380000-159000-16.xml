		<content>  What are the people of Bradford most 
 concerned about? Traffic,             
 unemployment, vandalism, education,   
 T.V., housing or nuclear war?         
  Many people are worried about traffic
 damaging our town. Heavy lorries      
 thunder through our narrow streets and
 grind up our steep hills. Exhaust     
 fumes belch into our atmosphere and   
 erode the fabric of our buildings.    
  Most grown ups are preoccupied by    
 keeping their families well housed,   
 well fed, well dressed and happy. They
 are very concerned about earning      
 enough money to do this. Most         
 families, especially the children,    
 spend most of their time watching     
 television. Sometimes parents split up
 and families reorganise themselves.   
  Young people are very worried about  
 employment and whether they will be   
 able to get a job or not.             </content>
