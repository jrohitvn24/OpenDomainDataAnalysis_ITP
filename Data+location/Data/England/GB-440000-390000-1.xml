		<title>01ROTHERHAM IS A LARGE TOWN...</title>
		<content> Rotherham is a large town in South    
 Yorkshire with a population of        
 250,000. It is the third largest of   
 the four South Yorkshire Metropolitan 
 Boroughs. It lies at the confluence of
 the rivers Don and Rother and has been
 renowned for its steel and iron       
 production since Roman times.  In     
 recent years this has declined with   
 the decrease in demand for            
 manufactured goods.  Sadly many       
 businesses and small factory complexes
 have closed and with this there has   
 been a rapid increase in unemployment 
 figures.  The town centre is now      
 greatly modernised with many new      
 buildings such as Hillards and the new
 Cascade Centre, and there is a new    
 General Hospital.  In comparison with 
 these there are several historic      
 places of interest such as the Chapel 
 on the Bridge. The town has two parks.</content>
