		<title>08SCHOOL CROSSING WARDEN</title>
		<content> A school crossing warden's job is to  
 see children safely across busy roads.
 When it is safe they go onto the road 
 and hold up a stick with a round      
 circle on top. It says STOP children. 
 It looks like a big lollipop so they  
 are called lollipop men or ladies.    
 They wear a bright coloured yellow or 
 white uniform so that drivers can see 
 them better.                          
                                       
 Recently in our local paper, the      
 Telford Journal, our warden has been  
 complaining about the cars going too  
 fast near St. Georges Primary School. 
 She wrote to our M.P.. She was having 
 nightmares about a child getting      
 knocked over. Nothing has been done so
 she has left. No one has taken the job
 so we are without a warden.
