		<content>   The Mechanics Institute was opened  
 in 1869.It was opened to further the  
 education of the working man and      
 contained a reading room and a        
 library.                              
   The reading room was open from 8am  
 until 10pm and any member reading     
 aloud or causing a nuisance was fined 
 1 penny.No member could keep a paper  
 longer than 10 minutes if another     
 member wanted it.                     
   During the 1910s and 20s it was used
 as a cinema.One of the films shown was
 "Alkali Ike's Mother-in-Law".People   
 were asked not to "whistle,stamp or   
 shout".It was recently used as a store
 for Bradford's museum service.        
   It is now a community centre where  
 there are clubs for all ages,including
 a youth club,over 60s club and keep   
 fit.Shoppers can call in for coffee.
