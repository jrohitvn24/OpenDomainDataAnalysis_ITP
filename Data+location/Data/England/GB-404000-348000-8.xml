		<title>08The River Hamps</title>
		<content>The River Hamps runs past our house. In
 Waterhouses it goes down a swallow    
 hole nd disappears underground and the
river bed is then dried up but in      
winter it fills up again.              
Brown trout and rainbow trout live in  
the river and most of the fishing      
rights are privately owned.            
The river starts on Morridge side. It  
flows through the hills to Onecote and 
through to Winkhill and Waterhouses,   
later joining the River Manifold.      
The River once flooded our house and it
took ages to clean it all up. During   
the flood a lady was rescued through   
her bedroom window by the quarrymen in 
a big digger. The river often gets high
and comes into our garden.             
Last winter it froze over and I walked 
up the river skating on top of the ice.
