		<title>06TOWEDNACK - A RURAL SCENE.</title>
		<content>  {Towednack}is a tiny, mainly         
 residential village.With exception of 
 two working farms the whole of the    
 village comprises of house's and      
 cottages.There are{no shops,no public 
{telephones}and{no bus stops.}At the   
 centre of the village is a small      
 privately owned pond containing ducks 
 and geese.The church is a well        
 maintained example from the 13th      
 century and still houses regular      
 Sunday services to a small            
 congregation of local people, led by  
 Canon Cotter.                         
  Breja Farm,is the smallest of two{   
{farms at Towednack.}Mr.Colin Nankervis
 and his wife run this largely animal  
 biased farm on their own.They keep    
 Ayreshire cattle for milking, sheep,  
 pigs, chickens and 13 working dogs.   
 Their sole crop is grass, for hay,    
 silage and grazing.                   </content>
