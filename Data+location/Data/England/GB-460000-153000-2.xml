		<content> The landscape is undulating, varying  
 in height from 250 feet at the        
 Wey Brook in Sherborne St. John, to   
 450 feet near Park Prewett Hospital.  
 The village of Sherborne St. John is  
 in a hollow with a belt of woodland to
 the north, and higher ground to the   
 south. This chalk scarp divides the   
 village from North Basingstoke. The   
 village open areas are mainly         
 privately owned with the village green
 and the recreation ground the         
 exceptions. The valley of the Wey     
 Brook forms a notable feature to the  
 north of the village.  The extensive  
 grounds of the Hospital are partly    
 landscaped and planted and include a  
 pleasant nine holed golf course.      
 Popley and Oakridge have a few open   
 spaces amongst the high density       
 housing, with play areas for the      
 children.                             </content>
