		<content> One of the recent major problems for  
 the community has been an apparent    
 decline in Forestry Commission        
 interest.The Head Forester departed in
 Dec.1984-this coincided with the      
 retirement of two other foresters.    
 Previously,the Head Forester had      
 organised labour/machinery to tidy the
 village and churchyard.Forestry       
 houses have been sold to private      
 owners and the administration of      
 Friston Forest now takes place from   
 Cambridge instead of Lyndhurst. There 
 is however a high level of local      
 involvement in maintaining the        
 physical amenities of the village;the 
 pond linked with the Cuckmere River,  
 has been cleared by residents, geese  
 and ducks provided by the owner of a  
 local property.On weekends,some       
 residents do voluntary work in the    
 forest dealing with vandals,fires,etc.</content>
