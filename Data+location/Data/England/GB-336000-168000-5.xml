{West End of Clevedon}is sea and       
 farmland so there are not many events.
 At {Mary Elton Primary School }there  
 are Christmas and summer fetes and car
 boot sales.Outside clubs for judo and 
 keep fit are also held at school.     
 At{St.Andrew's Church}they have       
 a church centre which you can hire out
 for parties.                          
 The{Scouts}have a market sometimes    
 which is held in{Marshall's Field}or  
 the {Salthouse Fields }which are local
 recreation fields.                    
 There is a {BMX Club}called the {     
{Clevedon Comets}which is held behind  
 the sports centre. In the sports
