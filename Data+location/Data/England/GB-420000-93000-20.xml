		<title>20  STREAMS IN HIGHCLIFFE</title>
		<content>   The{Walkford Brook}flows through    
 Highcliffe and flows through a lovely 
 valley called{Chewton Bunny.}The      
 Chewton Bunny road bridge was made in 
 1901 and it was the first reinforced- 
 concrete bridge in England. The sides 
 of the Bunny are covered with woods   
 and flowers. There are two or three   
 paths in the Bunny and little wooden  
 bridges cross the stream. You could go
 for a summer evening walk and you     
 would see many rabbits and squirrels. 
  {Bure Brook}starts from{Lakewood Lake
 and on its journey passes under six   
 bridges and finishes at Mudeford.     
{Another stream}starts in Walkford and 
 flows through Highcliffe to join      
 Bure Brook in Nea Meadows. It flows   
 under eight bridges and goes through  
 Cobb's Carauan Park.
