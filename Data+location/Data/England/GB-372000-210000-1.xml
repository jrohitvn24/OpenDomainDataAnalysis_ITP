		<content> The area is a pleasant{agricultural}  
 community split in half by the{River  
{Severn.}There is little need these    
 days for many Farm Labourers because  
 of modern machinery.                  
 The{climate}is generally mild but     
 because of the rural setting and lack 
 of{public transport}severe winters can
 bring feelings of isolation.          
 The{population}of the area is around a
 few hundred,mostly middle-aged who are
 either farmers or have moved here to  
 live in the peace and quiet of the    
 countryside away from towns.The       
 younger generation need to go to      
 nearby towns like{Gloucester}and{     
{Stroud} to find entertainment.        
 The major attraction of the area is   
 the{River Severn}which offers the     
 local people and visitors social and  
 leisure pursuits.
