		<content>The number of miles of hedges which    
have been removed is constantly quoted.
In some places one or two full grown   
trees indicate the line of what was    
once a hedgerow.                       
 The butterfly, and other animal       
populations are in decline.  An        
argument exists.  Some say that        
spraying with chemicals is the cause,  
though I have seen 'evidence' by       
"Shell" showing that various species'  
decline are related, statistically, to 
the removal of the habitat of the      
animal, the hedge and its associated   
strip of grass, together with trees    
and shrubs.  The removal of animal     
habitats causing the disappearance of  
a group of species, breaks the food    
chain, causing imbalances in           
traditional populations.               
The tractors now are enormous and      
expensive.                             </content>
