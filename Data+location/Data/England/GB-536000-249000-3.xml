		<title>03Barrinton Hall</title>
		<content> Barrintgotn Hall was built in the late
 17th century for Thomas Berdysle on   
 the site of a 15th century house. The 
 earliest manor house mentioned in the 
 Domesday Book of 1086 was situated    
 just at the rear of the hall. The only
 evidence is the homestead moat. In    
 1955 Eastwoods bought the hall to     
 convert into a central laboratory, but
 this plan was not carried out. In 1958
 it was let to tenants who started a   
 school specialising in preparing for  
 Cambridge Entrance Exam, but this     
 caused considerable annoyance to to   
 the people of the village. In 1966    
 Rugby Portland Cement used it as an   
 Eastern Area Sales Office. In 1979    
 major renovations and complete        
 refurbishing of the interior took     
 place.
