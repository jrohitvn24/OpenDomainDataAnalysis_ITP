		<content> Occupations and Industries in this    
 area are,apart from farming,not       
 necessary of a rural nature.We are    
 part of the commuter belt.People      
 travel to London daily while others   
 work in the local towns such as       
 Dunstable,Hemel Hempstead,Luton and   
 Watford.These have large              
 engineering,printing,building and     
 construction industries together with 
 retail shop outlets.We do have our own
 industrial estate at Kensworth        
 comprising six separate units which   
 employ some local labour.There are two
 garden centres and an animal feed     
 business all owned by local residents 
 who employ staff from the villages.The
 village shops and public houses run by
 the owners and their families who     
 usually live above the premises       
 provide part time work for local      
 ladies.                               </content>
