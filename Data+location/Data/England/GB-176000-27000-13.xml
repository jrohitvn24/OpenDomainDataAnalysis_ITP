		<content> In Mawnan there are lots of clubs to  
 suit all ages and all tastes. For the 
 young there is  a{Play group}and a    
{Toddler group}.For young boys there is
{Beavers}then Cubs.{Scouts}is coming   
 soon. Girls can start at{Brownies}then
{Guides}.The{Youth Club}is for people  
 from the age of 11. There is a{Mawnan 
{Wives}and a{W.I.}There is also a      
{Friendship}club, a{Methodist Guild}and
 Bingo. The Hall Committee meet        
 regularly to find ways of raising     
 money to maintain the Memorial Hall.  
 There are{Whist drives}every week     
 which the young and old partake. All  
 of these clubs are very well supported
 by locals and newcomers alike. It was 
 decided that a{Community Centre}was   
 needed with squash courts etc. at the 
 total cost of Â£40,000. After 2 yrs    
 intrest was lost by people who found  
 it difficult to raise the money.      </content>
