		<content> The chief recreational amenities in   
 the block are a private trout fishing 
 club at the Barns Fold Reservoirs, a  
 gliding club at Lower Cock Hill and   
 Beacon Fell Country Park. Game        
 shooting is available,too, because of 
 a number of small copses scattered    
 throughout the area which provide     
 cover for pheasants and partridges.   
 Ramblers are well-provided for by     
 pleasant footpaths. The lanes attract 
 cyclists and motorists, taking part in
 treasure hunts or rallys. Quite a few 
 people in the area own horses, riding 
 them on the lanes because bridle paths
 are few. Coaches bring in tourists,   
 often from Blackpool and Morecambe,   
 for tours. In winter, after a         
 snowfall, parents take their          
 youngsters sledging on Beacon Fell.
