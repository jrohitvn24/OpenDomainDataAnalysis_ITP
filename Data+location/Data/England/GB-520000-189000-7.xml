		<title>07BURNT OAK</title>
		<content> Burnt Oak was once four fields bounded
 by the Roman road Watling Street      
 on the west,and the Silkstream on     
 the east.The name comes from the Roman
 practice of burning one side of an oak
 tree to mark a boundary. Burnt Oak is 
 part of the Manor of Hendon recorded  
 in the Domesday Book, and was once    
 John the Goldbeater's farmland. The   
 London County Council bought this land
 in 1924 and built the Watling Estate  
 to rehouse people from Inner London.  
   Watling residents, when interviewed 
 about changes in the area over the    
 last five decades, regularly cited    
 streets being dirty and full of       
 rubbish in 1985. Also many thought the
 streets too narrow to cope with modern
 traffic and parking. The loss of two  
 cinemas and lack of sports/youth      
 facilities were felt to deprive the   
 area's young people.                  </content>
