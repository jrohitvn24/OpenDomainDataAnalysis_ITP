		<content> THIS AREA IS ONE SIDE OF A WIDE RIVER 
 VALLEY.PENDLE WATER FLOWS ALONG THE   
 VALLEY BOTTOM.OVER THE LAST 150 YEARS 
 THE  TWO SIDES HAVE DEVELOPED         
 DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENTLY.THE OTHER    
 SIDE HAS A CANAL,RAILWAY,TURNPIKE     
 ROAD,COTTON TOWNS WITH MILLS AND      
 TERRACED HOUSING:19 C.INDUSTRIAL TOWN.
   OVER SIDE REMAINED MORE  RURAL.UP TO
 30 YEARS AGO IT WAS NEARLY ALL ROUGH  
 GRAZING LAND WITH 2 SMALL VILLAGES -  
{HIGHAM AND FENCE.}EACH VILLAGE HAD A  
 SMALL TEXTILE MILL,A FEW SHOPS AND    
 FARM WORKERS.RECENTLY, THESE VILLAGES 
 HAVE GROWN AS COMMUTER VILLAGES       
 BECAUSE ROADS HAVE IMPROVED.OUR NEW   
 MOTORWAY WILL MEAN THIS TREND WILL    
 CONTINUE.THE VILLAGES ARE QUIET,MIDDLE
 CLASS PLACES,FEW SHOPS,FEW BUS        
 SERVICES,NO VANDALS. CARS ARE         
 ESSENTIAL.                    PLEASANT
 SCENIC PLACES WHERE NOT A LOT GOES ON.</content>
