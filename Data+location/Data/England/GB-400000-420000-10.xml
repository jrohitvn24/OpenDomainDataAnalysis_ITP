		<title>10FARMING WORMS AND COMPOST</title>
		<content>{Wonder Worms}produces 5 or 6 species  
 for fishermen.They are kept in  large 
 beds of manure and fed with animal    
 manure to which is added waste paper, 
 card and offal.The worms are exported 
 to many countries packed in plastic   
 containers of peat holding 10,000     
 worms.They keep for three weeks.In    
 late summer many worms are fed on pig 
 meal,which makes them about 10 cm long
 and as thick as a pencil,for special  
 fishing.In Winter the beds are covered
 with 30cms of straw. They bury        
 themselves deep in the beds,lay eggs  
 and surface in the Spring.{The Manure}
 containing the worms has been         
 converted into a {high content organic
{material}which is extremely valuable  
 as compost.This is sold to garden     
 centres and stores.
