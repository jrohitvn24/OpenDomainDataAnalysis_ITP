		<content> The main crops grown in the area are  
 the cereal crops of{wheat and barley.}
 Both winter and spring crops are      
 grown. Most of the farms use the      
 tramline method of access to their    
 crops for{spraying}although some      
 aerial spraying is carried out towards
 the end of the growing season. The    
 smaller farmers often employ          
{contractors}to harvest their crops.   
 After the{harvest,}which can vary     
 between mid-July and late August, the 
 stubble is usually burnt off and large
 clouds of smoke can be seen across the
 countryside at this time. A small     
 amount of oats and maize is also      
 grown. Apart from cereal crops there  
 are also fields of potatoes, turnips, 
 are peas, but these only account for a
 small portion of the farmland. A few  
 of the old{cider orchards}still remain
 but they are mostly run-down.         </content>
