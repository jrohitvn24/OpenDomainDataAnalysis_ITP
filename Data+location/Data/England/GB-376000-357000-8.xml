		<content> The section of motorway in the block  
 was part of the section from Hanchurch
 to Lymm. To build this 33 miles of    
 motorway, 1110 acres of land were     
 acquired and 10,392,000 tons of earth 
 were moved. The maximum labour force  
 was 3,680 and the motorway was        
 designed for 3 lanes of traffic at    
 speeds of up to 75 mph.               
                                       
 The construction of the motorway was  
 done by 3 major civil engineering     
 contractors, John Laing Constr. Ltd., 
 Sir Lindsey Parkinson &amp; Co. Ltd. and  
 Tarmac Civil Engineering Ltd..        
                                       
 Two groups of boys surveyed the       
 traffic on the motorway their report  
 is on pages 9 &amp; 10 together with a    
 survey prepared by the school in 1981.
