		<title>19TRADE IN LINTON</title>
		<content>   The busiest shop was the Newsagents 
 with customers staying under 15       
 minutes and spending less than Â£5.It  
 is most important for daily use.      
   The Co-op amd V.G seemed to have the
 same number of customers,most of these
 were female.Most of the shoppers are  
 local people and aged 55-60 years.They
 were usually shopping for themselves  
 rather than a family.They used the    
 shops several times a week especially 
 Friday and Saturday.                  
   We think that the younger adults    
 with families shop in a larger town or
 shopping centre.Because it is cheaper 
 and they could get a larger range of  
 goods.                                
 Linton is not a very important trade  
 centre but it does have a small estate
 agents,insurance office and betting   
 office.
