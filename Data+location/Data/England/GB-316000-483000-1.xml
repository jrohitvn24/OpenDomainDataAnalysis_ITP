		<title>01THWAITES, AN OVERVIEW</title>
		<content> Our Domesday area is a rural one, the 
 main use of land being connected with 
 farming. However this doesn't employ  
 many people. The land is mainly       
 pasture, with quite a lot of rough    
 pasture and mixed woodland. There is a
 low density of population. We estimate
 that there are less than 500 people   
 living in our area. Probably because  
 of the low population there are very  
 few amenities. Our area is bordered to
 the west by the Duddon Estuary. The   
 land is quite hilly, rising from sea  
 level to 174 metres above. Just over  
 half of the working population travel 
 five miles or less to work.Many work  
 in Millom,our nearest small town about
 three miles away. There is no one     
 predominant employer either in Millom 
 or for those who travel further afield
 For the purpose of our survey we are  
 referring to the area as "Thwaites".  </content>
