		<content>        Barnsley Market                
                                       
   Barnsley has had a market since     
 the Middle Ages.In 1249,the monks were
 granted a Royal Charter by Henry      
 III,which allowed them to hold a      
 weekly market and annual fair on May  
 Day Green.                            
  When the town was redeveloped, in    
 the 1970's, the old open areas        
 disappeared to make way for the new   
 complex.                              
  Today the market is a new building   
 consisting of a 2-storey covered      
 hall,a semi-open area and an          
 outdoor market.                       
  The indoor market is open weekdays   
 but the other two sections are only   
 open on the traditional market days,  
                                       
{ Wednesdays, Fridays}and{Saturdays }.
