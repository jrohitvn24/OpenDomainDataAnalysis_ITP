		<title>14Tourism in Bromp on Swale</title>
		<content> Tourists have been coming to Brompton 
 on Swale for the past 20 to 25 years .
 Tourists come to Brompton for the     
 races, for Richmond and the Dales .   
                                       
 The races take place at the           
 race-course at Catterick Bridge.      
 People come from all over the country.
 The Bridge House Hotel can get over   
 crowded on race days.                 
                                       
 The dales around Richmond are very    
 crowded in the summer because of      
 tourist traffic. Many camping and     
 caravanning sites have been set up.   
 Some farmers have started Bed and     
 Breakfast for tourists.               
                                       
 The tourists have awakened an interest
 in old crafts such as Corn Dolly      
 making and Spinning and Weaving which 
 now take place in the village.        </content>
