 Most people living in our grid work in
 either Bideford or Barnstaple.  Both  
 these towns are within easy commuting 
 distance which is indeed why some     
 people choose to live here.  There is 
 a Royal Marine Camp at Instow which   
 employs a number of civilians.  Very  
 few people come into the grid to work.
  The teachers and kitchen staff do as 
 do a few farm workers otherwise our   
 grid offers no other employment.  In  
 the tourist season Instow is a busy   
 little sailing and beach resort and   
 local people are employed in seasonal 
 work.  It must all have been very     
 different when the farms employed     
 large numbers of people before they   
 were replaced with machinery.  Local  
 craftsmen like the blacksmith would   
 also have been found working in our   
 area.                                 </content>
