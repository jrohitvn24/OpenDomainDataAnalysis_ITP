		<content> The river Sour and several recently   
 created lakes give very good          
 fishing.The river weeds are little    
 sedge reed, milfoil and bullrush.The  
 local angling club have caught 24 mink
 beetween 1983 and 1984.Mink make a of 
 differents because before they were   
 caught there were hardly any birds    
 near the river.The biggest fish caught
 in this part of the river is a chub at
 2lbs 10oz.There has been some chemical
 pollution in recent years but the     
 source of the pollution has been found
 and corrected.To replace fish lost    
 through disease and pollution,the     
 Wessex Water Board rears many         
 thousands of fresh water fish each    
 year.These are mainly roach           
 ,bream,perch,minnows,gudgeon and dace.
