		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD 8 YRS.   
 I get up at 8.a.m. get dressed and    
 have cornflakes for breakfast.  I walk
 to school with my friends.  School    
 begins at 9.a.m. with an assembly, and
 then we have lessons.  During playtime
 we play games like British Bulldog.   
 after lunch we paint or make          
 plasticine models.  The teacher reads 
 us a story and then it is time to go  
 home.  After tea I play with my friend
 Claire.  We play hide and seek and    
 tiggy.  Afterwards I watch television.
  My favourite programme is A. Team.  I
 have my supper and go to bed at 9 p.m.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
