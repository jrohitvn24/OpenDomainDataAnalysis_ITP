		<content>  {Tomatoes}are cropped between April  
 and October at 100 tons per acre      
 A.Y.R. Unrooted cuttings of           
{chrysanthemums}are purchased from     
 Malta, South Africa and Tenerife and  
 are cropped 3-5 times each year.      
  {Spraying}of all crops is kept to a  
 minimum, but is still needed to ensure
 healthy crops.{Biological control}of  
 pests is now practical using parasite 
 predator and fungicidal treatments.   
   Chrysanthemums are{marketed}either  
 to local shops or sold in bulk through
 wholesale marketed. Tomatoes and      
 lettuce are all sold through G.M.S., a
 grower owned Cooperative. This was    
 found essential to maximise returns   
 from the market place. The present    
{labour force}consists of 6 full-time, 
 2 part-time with 4-6 casual workers in
 summer. The{future}is uncertain due to
 heavy pressure from EEC imports.      </content>
