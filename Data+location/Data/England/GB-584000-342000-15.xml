		<title>15A HOLKHAM EMPLOYEE</title>
		<content> My name is Mike Thompson and I live in
 Burnham Overy Staithe.  I work for    
 Lord Coke on the Holkham Hall Estate. 
 I get up at 6.30 am every day and     
 begin by making a cup of tea.  I am   
 then ready to eat my breakfast.  After
 this I wash and dress before leaving  
 for work at 7.10 am.  I arrive at work
 at 7.30 am.  I have many jobs to do at
 the Hall such as mounting paintings,  
 cleaning the high ceilings and        
 generally reaching the difficult      
 spots!  I have a tea-break at 10.00 am
 with another at 3.00 pm.  Lunch       
 usually lasts from 12.30 - 1.00 pm.   
 Tired I finish work at 5.00 pm.  When 
 I get home I have a quick wash and    
 enjoy my tea.  I help my wife to wash 
 up and then play with my children     
 Rohan and John.  In the evening I call
 on my mother before going to bed at   
 10.30 pm.                             </content>
