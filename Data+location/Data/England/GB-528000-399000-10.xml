		<title>10THE P.T.A.</title>
		<content> Our school has a very active P.T.A.   
 It raises a lot of money to buy things
 for school.                           
 Every year we have a Summer Fayre     
 which lasts for 2 days.On the Saturday
 afternoon there are games and stalls, 
 and in the evening the adults have a  
 barn dance in a large marquee in the  
 school grounds.On the Sunday there is 
 a church or chapel service followed by
 a farm lunch on the lawn of a local   
 farmer.This is always good fun.       
 During the rest of the year all kinds 
 of activities are organised.The       
 P.T.A.has recently bought play        
 equipment,science and technology      
 equipment,library books and musical   
 instruments.
