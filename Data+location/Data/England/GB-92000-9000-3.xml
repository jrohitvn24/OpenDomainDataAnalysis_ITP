		<content>      The roads around here are very   
 narrow.There is one haulage business  
 consisting of three lorries although  
 many farmers and small businessmen use
 their own tractors and vans. There is 
 a bus service which operates daily.   
 There are also three taxi services    
 with six taxis altogether. Many       
 residents use bicycles and there are  
 two Bicycle Hire services available to
 the tourists. Motorbikes and mopeds   
 are very popular and there are approx.
 300_500 private cars on the island.
