		<content> The bulk of the population in this    
 area live on the housing estates. Most
 of the remainder are scattered in the 
 farms &amp; cottages or in good sized     
 country houses. These last are well   
 off and have a range of higher income 
 occupations: business men, bankers,   
 stock-brokers, accountants etc. Many  
 in the smaller scattered properties   
 are farmers, farm workers, herdsmen   
 etc. Most people work locally; traders
 &amp; light industrial workers in and     
 around East Grinstead. Of those living
 in the town  many work in the local   
 shops offices &amp; schools. Many are     
 employed at Gatwick Airport. A lot are
 in the building trades, there being no
 shortage of construction work in this 
 affluent area. Ther are a fair number 
 of people who commute to work in      
 Croydon &amp; London. Only the heavy      
 industries are not well represented.  </content>
