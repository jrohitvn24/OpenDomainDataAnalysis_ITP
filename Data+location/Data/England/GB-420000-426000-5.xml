		<content>  Lack of Woodland in the area and     
 the undulating terrain is mainly      
 urbanized. Farmland is poor quality &amp; 
 either stock_fattening or m/gardening 
 takes place. A feature is the demise  
 of coalmines, railways and woollen    
 mills;the latter have been converted  
 to light engineering or man made      
 fibres. The Common, scene of a battle 
 in 1643, is a landmark and important  
 area for recreation.                  
 Few pre-war houses remain.            
 The first few houses were built late  
 1930's.In 1955 a private estate,Dean  
 Park was built on open fields.Kingsway
 Estate,a mixture of flats and private 
 housing built around 1960 on old      
 property and allotments.In 1963 a very
 large estate,Buckross,built on open   
 fields.Street names like Margetson,   
 Fairfax,Walton &amp; Oakwell reflect local
 history.                              </content>
