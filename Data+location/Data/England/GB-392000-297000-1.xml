		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION BLOCK D</title>
		<content>The area is situated immediately to the
east of the centre of Wolverhampton. It
is bounded by Heath Town to the north, 
Bilston to the the south and Willenhall
to the east.                           
Approximately 25% of the block is      
comprised of derelict land, formerly   
sites of old industries. Most of the   
land, however, is utilised for         
residential purposes of a mixed nature.
The population is now multi ethnic and 
this is reflected in the shops and     
places of worship in the area.         
The block is served by a complex       
network of roads some of which link    
eventually with the M6 Motorway.It is  
traversed by the Birmingham -          
Wolverhampton railway.Surviving canals 
are derelict.                          
Employment derives from light industry 
and services but the depression has    
caused increasing loss of jobs.        </content>
