 ranging from tihy kindergartens to a  
 large secondary school.Some are       
 maintained by the London Borough of   
 Croydon, and others are independently 
 owned.Whitgift is one of the richest  
 private schools in England.It owns a  
 large part of Croydon's Whitgift      
 Centre and receives money from the    
 rent of shops in the shopping centre. 
                                       
 The earliest age children can start   
 school is three and a half, and they  
 can stay until they are eighteen and a
 half.Many subjects are taught         
 including various technical
