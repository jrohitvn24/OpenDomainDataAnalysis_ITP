		<title>02THE ICE-AGE</title>
		<content> During the Ice-age there was at some  
 stage a vast barrier of ice to the    
 east of the river Breamish. This      
 prevented the escape of river melt-   
 water. Water built up into the valley 
 forming a vast lake. As one travels up
 the valley today you can clearly see  
 the shore-line of this glacial lake   
 some 50 to 100 feet above the present 
 valley floor. The water actually      
 flowed out of the lake at the nearby  
 village of Powburn, through a deep    
 glacial overflow channel and into a   
 similar lake in the neighbouring Aln  
 valley.
