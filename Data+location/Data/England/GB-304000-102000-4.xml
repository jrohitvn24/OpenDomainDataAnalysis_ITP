		<title>04PEOPLE IN PLYMTREE</title>
		<content> All age groups can be found living in 
 Plymtree.  A large retired population 
 is slowly being replaced by a younger 
 generation with families.  Most       
 children attend Plymtree Primary      
 School or nearby Secondary Schools.   
 They walk or cycle to the Primary     
 School but have to be bused to the    
 Secondary Schools.  A housewife spends
 her day looking after her family:     
 cleaning, cooking and washing, but may
 have time for her hobbies or going for
 a walk.  Some housewives do a part-   
 time job for half the day away from   
 their homes.  Retired people do a     
 little housework but often have help  
 with the cleaning.  They go for walks,
 watch television and read during the  
 day. Most men who live in Plymtree    
 work away from the village.   Everyone
 likes living in Plymtree very much and
 we all get on very well together.     </content>
