		<content> In common with other primary schools, 
 Tackley and Wootton Schools face the  
 problem of{falling rolls} and the     
 likelihood of losing teachers and     
 there fore fewer classes in 1987. The 
 hours allowed for cleaning and cooking
 mid-day meals have been cut.  The     
 Schools are in good heart,the children
 learning from first hand experience.  
 They learn to organise their own work.
{Small schools} are threatened with    
 closure; big schools are cheaper to   
 run, have better facilities and       
 specialist staff. Yet here we have    
 close support from parents; staff     
 tailor work to suit the individual    
 child while the atmosphere of the     
 school is friendlier and less formal  
 than in a large school.
