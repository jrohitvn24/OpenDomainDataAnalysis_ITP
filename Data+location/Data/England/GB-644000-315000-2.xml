		<content> If you visit the village of Martham   
 it is worth going to the old Medieval 
 church with its lovely woodwork and   
 stained glass windows.                
 If you like walking there are many    
 footpaths and farm tracks that run    
 from the two villages through the     
 arable fields where there are lots of 
 birds and wild animals to see and many
 beautiful wild flowers in the hedges  
 and fields.                           
{Things to do}The Broads are a great   
 place for birdwatchers to come and    
 people of all ages come here for      
 sports,fishing both from a boat and on
 the shore and canoeing.               
 The shady woodland and parkland around
 the broads are great places to have   
 picnics.                              
 If you have children they can play on 
 the playing fields by Rollesby Road   
 Martham or near Rollesby school.      </content>
