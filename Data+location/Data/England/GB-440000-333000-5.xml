 mixture of crops.                     
  The area of {Elvaston Castle Country 
{Park}represented within this grid     
 square shows a balanced ecological    
 system.The landscaped pool provides a 
 source of food and shelter for a range
 of migrating and resident water birds.
  The woodland,although predominantly  
 deciduous,contains a wide variety of  
 species of coniferous trees.          
  Rangers from the{Study Centre}lead   
 field visits by groups from schools.In
 June 1985 one such visit by {Asterdale
{School}8/9 year old pupils took place.
  Half the cost of transport was paid  
 by the Study Centre.Follow-up work was
 completed at school,mounted and sent  
 to the Centre for display.Over fifty  
 different insects and other creatures 
 were collected in a 30minute period.  </content>
