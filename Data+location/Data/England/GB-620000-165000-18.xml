		<title>18LOCAL HISTORY 2</title>
		<content> The people of the area are proud that 
 every acre of land here has {historic 
{associations.}Some of them play an    
 active role with Archaeologists in    
 keeping watch over the phenomina of{  
{crop-marks}which show history written 
 on the fields each spring. It was a   
 local Farmer who discoved first the   
 Roman, and then the Iron Age sites at 
{Highstead.}When these were excavated, 
 relations between Archaeologists and  
 the  Community were excellent. Some   
 finds including a mould for casting   
 bronze pins (Iron Age) were stolen    
 during a break-in, but this was       
 thought to be the work of 'outsiders'.
 Long after the excavations have ended 
 the locals still keep{collections}of  
 flints and pot sherds that they come  
 across during their daily round for   
 periodic collection by the            
 archaeologists.                       </content>
