		<title>17Coolham/Shipley Local Issues</title>
		<content> Shipley has lost its bus service and  
 local shop/P.O. Coolham's bus service 
 is very reduced despite the recent new
 brick/tile bus shelter. Planning      
 policy limits new building &amp; there is 
 concern that the  village schools     
 increasingly depend on "out of area"  
 children to maintain numbers.         
 Preserving the  character of the area 
 is a "live" issue among locals as is  
 the traffic problem in Coolham. The   
 newly formed Coolham Recreation Ground
 Association is asking the Parish      
 Council to improve &amp; maintain this    
 once fully equipped amenity. In       
 Shipley there is concern about the    
 future of the Knepp Estate. Residents 
 in the area are now happily looking   
 forward to the 900th anniversary      
 celebrations of Christian Worship in  
 Shipley Church on 22 September 1985.
