		<content>   The name Stanford comes originally  
 from a stone ford across a local      
 rivulet,the Hassen Brook.This was     
 later replaced by a bridge.Le Hope    
 refers to a large bend in the River   
 Thames which occurs nearby and        
 represented a safe haven for ships    
 after the more exposed waters of the  
 estuary.                              
   There is a record of the Manor of   
 Hassingeburc in the Domesday Book.The 
 Tenant-in-Chief was Bishop Odo,the    
 half-brother of King William.It would 
 appear that there were two manors,the 
 other being the Manor of Stanford     
 which was held by Waltham Abbey.Later 
 the lands were divided into 3 manors, 
 Hassingbrook,Cabourne's and Abbotts   
 Hall.                                 
   The 1851 Census tells us that the   
 population of Stanford le Hope was    
 439.                                  </content>
