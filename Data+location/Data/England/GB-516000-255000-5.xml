		<content>  We went to see{Mr Smith}the farm     
 manager and he told us alot about the 
 estate and took us around{Top Farm.}  
   For a long time they had just sheep 
 and cattle but twenty years ago they  
 stopped keeping sheep.The grazing land
 was then used for crops.The main crops
 which are grown on the estate are{Oil 
{Seed Rape,Barley}and{Wheat}but they   
 also have a few acres of{Brussels     
{Sprouts}in the winter.The estate is   
 divided by the Little Barford road.On 
 the left handside of the road coming  
 from{St. Neots}is where most of the   
 crops are grown.On the right side the 
 cattle are kept.
