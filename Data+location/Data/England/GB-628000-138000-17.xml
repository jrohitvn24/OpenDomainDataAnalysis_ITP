		<content> The role of the Customs and Excise    
 office is to enforce a wide variety of
 laws.They work in alliance with the   
 Police concerning drugs,Department of 
 Agriculture,Fisheries and Food        
 checking food,animals and endangered  
 species with or without a license,and 
 the Home Office concerning the import 
 of firearms and other offensive       
 weapons.                              
                                       
 The Customs and Excise officers check 
 as many vehicles as humanly possible, 
 without causing too many delays,for   
 illegal goods entering and leaving the
 country or that goods have had the    
 correct duties paid,firearms are      
 licensed and any other offensive      
 weapons are found.Another less        
 prominent factor is the import of     
 pornographic items.
