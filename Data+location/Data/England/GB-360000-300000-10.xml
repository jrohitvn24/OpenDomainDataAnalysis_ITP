		<title>10FARMING</title>
		<content>  Over the last 20 years Agriculture in
 the area has changed considerably with
 the old small,hedged fields giving way
 to large rectangular ones from which  
 hedges have been removed in order to  
 accommodate modern machinery.         
  The steepest part of the scarp is    
 forested, chiefly by conifers   but   
 with pockets of native deciduous trees
 being planted as conifers are felled. 
  The dip slope of Wenlock Edge &amp; the  
 less steep part of the scarp is given 
 to cereal farming, particularly barley
 which has replaced the former activity
 of sheep rearing.This has been        
 facilitated by the advent of          
 high-powered,4 wheel drive tractors.  
  On the lower,wetter land dairying    
 predominates.This is a highly         
 scientific process,with cattle fed by 
 computer programmes according to yield
 &amp; milked in modern milking parlours.  </content>
