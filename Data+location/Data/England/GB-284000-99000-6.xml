		<content> Mr. Woodford is our Headmaster. He has
 been Headmaster of Hayward Primary    
 School for seventeen years and is     
 leaving on the nineteenth of July     
 1985. He lives in Shobrooke and he    
 knows alot about it which is very     
 handy for the Domesday project. He is 
 a very good Headmaster and we don't   
 want him to leave. Apart from his     
 work in school he is a very important 
 person in the Scouts and Guides       
 because he is head in this area.
