		<title>15WILBARSTON PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>The school at Wilbarston is at the end 
of the village,surrounded by open      
countryside.                           
The new building dates from 1977 but   
the old one is still used for the      
infants and as a resources centre.     
There are five classes with five full  
time teachers and one part time        
including the headmaster who has been  
there for eighteen years.              
There are 121 children and they come   
from Wilbarston,Middleton,East         
Carlton,Ashley,Stoke Albany,Sutton     
Bassett,Dingley,Weston by Welland and  
Brampton Ash.                          
The children study the Fletcher        
Mathematics Scheme and the Ginn 360    
Reading Scheme.                        
A strict timetable is not followed     
apart from the use of the hall.        
About 45 children have school dinners  
(55p) and the same number packed lunch.</content>
