     The increasing population of      
Eccleston resulted in a new school     
being built in 1969.It was built on the
site of Sharples House Farm.New houses 
had already been built on the land     
which had belonged to the farm.        
     The school is surrounded by       
playing fields.A small area of         
woodland, which was once known as      
Banks Wood, has been preserved as a    
nature area,where children can study   
wildlife.The school has 7  classrooms, 
at  present accomodating 210           
children, 9 teachers,1 secretary       
and 2 ancillary assistants. The school 
has its own kitchen and staff, but     
most children bring food from home     
for the mid-day meal.                  
     The oldest children have an       
opportunity to go on a school holiday  
each year. This year Whitby was chosen.</content>
