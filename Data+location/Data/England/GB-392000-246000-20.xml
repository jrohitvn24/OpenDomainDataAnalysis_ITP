 We have to be in the scout hut by 6   
 o'clock every Tuesday. First we have  
 Grand Howl in which we lower the flag 
 and salute it then Arkela lowers her  
 arms and we have to crouch down and   
 say "Arkela we will do our best".     
 After tnat we have inspection where   
 the sixer checks your pack, your      
 neckerchief and sees that your hands  
 are clean.  After that we have to give
 in our testwork if we have got any or 
 we do something with the rest of the  
 six _ like playing games, tracking or 
 doing some knotting.  Last week we    
 went to visit the police station. At  
 the end of the evening we have another
 Grand Howl and some prayers and then  
 we go home at half past seven.
