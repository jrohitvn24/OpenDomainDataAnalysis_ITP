		<title>16THE REX CINEMA CONTINUED</title>
		<content> Touring companies go there instead of 
 the Rex prior to their West-End       
 showing.                              
    The space left from the screen     
 being moved forward will be hired to  
 shops for another source of income.   
    The most{popular films}and{plays   
 have proved to be{comedies.}The Rex   
 shows films for all different age     
 groups and on average{1500 people go  
{each week.}The manager believes that  
 the main things that attract people   
 are,{the type of film, film stars,    
 and the{attractive surroundings.      
   {Twelve people}are employed at the  
 Rex but only{two work full time. Ten  
{extra people}are hired when a play is 
 being produced but their jobs are     
 terminated  when the play finishes.
