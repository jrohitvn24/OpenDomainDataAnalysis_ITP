		<title>19LIVING IN THE CLUNTON AREA</title>
		<content> Most people who live in the Clunton   
 area are either involved in           
 agriculture or choose to live here    
 despite it's disadvantages. These are 
 mainly linked to work. Lack of        
 commerce and industry mean that people
 who work must travel so petrol bills  
 are high. Many young are forced to    
 leave the area to train or work. This 
 means that there are few families with
 small children.                       
    It can sometimes be difficult in   
 the winter for those not on the main  
 road as side roads remain uncleared of
 snow. Junior children miss quite a lot
 of school because the outside toilets 
 are frozen.                           
    On the whole however we are content
 with our lot. We live in beautiful    
 surroundings and it's disadvantages   
 are outweighted by the joy of living  
 in a close community.                 </content>
