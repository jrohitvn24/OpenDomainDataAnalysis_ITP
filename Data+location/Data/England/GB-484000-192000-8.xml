		<title>08WYCOMBE'S CHAIR INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>{ High Wycombe}is famous for it's{chair
{industry}which has developed over{200 
{years. Beech trees}grow well in the   
 Chiltens because they like chalky soil
 and the{bodgers}used these to make    
 chair legs. During the 18th bodgers   
 lived among the trees in the woods    
 around Wycombe in their huts turning  
 chair legs. They used a{pole lathe,   
 driven by a young larch pole. The legs
 were taken to{factories}where the     
 framer fitted together the part which 
 make up the chairs. About 1790 the    
 early factories came into being and by
 the{mid-nineteenth century}there were 
 about a hundred furniture factories in
 Wycombe. We still have many furniture 
 firms The best known are{Parker Knoll,
{Ercol}and{Gommes.                     
  The{Chair Museum}tells the{history of
{chair making}around Wycombe, with many
 tools,and a{Bodger's hut.             </content>
