 Pupils from Glendale Middle School    
 visited Alnwick to present HRH        
 Princess Anne with a cheque for Â£64.  
 This made a total of Â£765 donated to  
 Save the Children Fund in 1985,to help
 the starving people in Africa.        
    Parked  lorries are posing a safety
 hazard to pedestrians and motorists   
 who must cross a main road junction   
 near Wooler.The lorries restrict visi-
 bility from the Peth along South Road.
    Wooler bus driver John Hodge has   
 retired after 46 years service with   
 the United Automobile Company.        
    The retirement of Mr.&amp;Mrs.M.Heckles
 has meant the end of a 150 year busin-
 ess link.The building firm of George  
 Beattie had been part of the community
 since 1835.
