		<title>10MENDIP DRY STONE WALLS</title>
		<content>    Most walls on the  Mendips are dry 
 stone walls. Now only a few people can
 make them. Walls were originally built
 by farmers who cleared stones from the
 fields to avoid the stones breaking   
 their ploughs. The walls were built to
 mark boundaries and provide shelter   
 for stock and crops. In recent years  
 many walls have been lost due to      
 neglect or bulldozing, to make bigger 
 fields for modern machinery.          
    Barbed wire fences and hedges have 
 taken the place of many stone walls.  
 Building dry stone walls is an art and
 also very slow and expensive.         
    The foundation stones of the walls 
 are laid at least three feet thick and
 and two stones wide. The gaps between 
 are filled with smaller stones and    
 chippings. "Bonders", stones which    
 almost pass through the wall, help tie
 the wall together.                    </content>
