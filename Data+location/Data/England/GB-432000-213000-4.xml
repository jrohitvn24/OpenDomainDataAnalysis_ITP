The Blanket Bus was a South Midlands   
bus that used to go to Ramsden. It was 
like a little maroon and cream van     
with twelve seats,windows and a door   
like a normal bus. It stopped going to 
Ramsden on the 15th June 1985 so all   
the people who lived there and         
couldn't walk or drive couldn't keep   
their dental or doctor appointments or 
anything else in Witney because they   
wouldn't be able to get there.         
                                       
That was the last bus to visit Ramsden.
Stopping the Blanket Bus has caused    
alot of problems. I bet you wouldn't   
walk to a far distance place from      
Ramsden. The people are now just       
stranded unless they have a car.
