		<content>  In our area we have:3 Public houses, 
 3 Bed and Breakfast houses,1          
 Restaurant, and a Caravan park.The 3  
 Public houses are situated all round  
 the area,but none of them offer       
 accommodation.Our 3 Bed and Breakfast 
 houses offer accommodation to anybody 
 who wants it,and often have people    
 staying from abroad.                  
   The Restaurant is near the Village  
 Church.It is an old coaching house,and
 William of Orange dined there when    
 passing through the village to Newton 
 Abbot.                                
   The caravan park is situated near   
 our Village School,and is open to the 
 public all year round.It has 27       
 caravans there in high season.        
   The area is attractive to tourists  
 as it is quieter than the coastal     
 towns,but convienient for visits to   
 Dartmoor and the seaside.             </content>
