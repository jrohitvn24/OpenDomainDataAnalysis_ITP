		<content>    {Not Last Night}is a skipping game 
 three or more people can play. Someone
 stands in the middle. The two people  
 holding the ends of the rope keep     
 turning it round and round they keep  
 doing this until they have finished   
 saying the rhyme, the rhyme goes like 
 this: Not last night but the night    
 before 24 robbers came knocking at my 
 door, as I went out to let them in    
 this is what they said to me: Spanish 
 lady turn around Spanish lady touch   
 the ground Spanish lady  do the high  
 kicks Spanish lady do the splits.     
    What ever they say in the ryhme you
 must do whilst still skipping.        
    This is one of the games we play at
 our school.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
