		<title>16HAYFIELD,A CHANGING VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> Where the village hall is,used to be  
 Hayfield cinema, and where the library
 is on Kinder Road used to be the      
 Highbourne Methodist Sunday school    
 which my mum went to.                 
 The old library stood along where The 
 Skillet car park is and at the side   
 was a school which children attended  
 until they were four.After that they  
 went to the top school where we go    
 today. The Hayfield to New Mills      
 railway line is now a nature trail and
 the two signal boxes in between       
 Hayfield and The Vine are now houses  
 in which families live. The house next
 to Ken Rangely's paper shop used to be
 a barbers shop. The Hayfield by-pass  
 has taken the heavy traffic from out  
 of the village.The bus terminal which 
 was in the Royal car park, is now at  
 the entrance of the Sett Valley Trail.
