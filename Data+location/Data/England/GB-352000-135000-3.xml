		<title>03Apple Orchards</title>
		<content> In the 66 acres of apple orchard      
 around West Bradley House 22 different
 kinds of eating apples are grown.The  
 most popular apple is the Cox.        
 The business was started 100 years    
 ago.2 full time staff are employed and
 additional seasonal staff.There is a  
 small area where the public can pick  
 their own.                            
 Potash is used as a fertiliser and the
 trees are sprayed once a fortnight    
 from April to July to protect them    
 from scab.                            
 In a good season the orchards yield   
 between 100 and 200 tons of apples.   
 Some are sold at West Bradley House.  
 but most are sold nationally through  
 Bristol Market. They are sold for 8p  
 to 25p a pound. 30 acres are given to 
 cider apples. These are sold to       
 Showerings at Shepton Mallet.
