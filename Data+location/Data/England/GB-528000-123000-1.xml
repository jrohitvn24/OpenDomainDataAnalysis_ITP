		<title>01A GAZETTEER OF THE AREA</title>
		<content>  This area is set in the centre of the
 wooded and clay soiled Sussex Weald.  
 It is dominated by the village of     
 Cuckfield. The rural area is composed 
 largely of arable crop land and       
 deciduous woodland.                   
  Cuckfield lies 2 miles west of       
 Haywards Heath astride the busy A272  
 road, which is the major east/west    
 route through the region. A bypass for
 the village has been proposed to      
 overcome the damaging effects of      
 traffic passing through an important  
 conservation area. Many residents make
 use of the fast London to Brighton    
 railway service through Haywards Heath
 to commute daily to work in London.   
  The block boasts a large regional    
 hospital and comprehensive school with
 good local shopping and recreational  
 facilities available in the village.
