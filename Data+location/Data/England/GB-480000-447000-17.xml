		<content> John Brown is has been headmaster of  
 Woldgate School, Pocklington for the  
 past 12 years.                        
{Q. What do you think are the          
{advantages of a pupil attending       
{Woldgate School rather than           
{Pocklington School ?}                 
 A.I think there is a social advantage,
 I can best illustrate this by the case
 of the Thornton Family, whose father  
 was Vicar at Everingham for a long    
 time until fairly recently. All four  
 children came to us, although Anglican
 Ministers' children usually go into   
 private education. Reverend Thornton's
 view was that Woldgate was a miniature
 world and he wanted his children to   
 know that the world is populated by   
 all sorts of people with all sorts of 
 ideas, some rich, some poor, and he   
 wanted his children to grow up        
 realising this.                       </content>
