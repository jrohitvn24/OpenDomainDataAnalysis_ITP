		<title>01OUR D BLOCK</title>
		<content>  Our 'D' Block consists of two valleys
 mainly - Sheepscombe Valley and       
 Cranham Valley and is on the west side
 of the Cotswolds. There are two       
 streams which join and flow into the  
 Severn. There are three villages and  
 one hamlet. The villages are called   
 Cranham, Sheepscombe and Whiteway. The
 hamlet is called Climperwell. The land
 in the valleys is mostly grazing for  
 store and dairy cattle and an         
 increasing number of sheep. On the    
 higher,flatter parts intensive arable 
 farming is the norm. Both Sheepscombe 
 and Cranham have changed since 1945   
 into commuter villages with a         
 resultant upgrading in the standard of
 housing. The two villages are favoured
 spots for picnics and country walks   
 and the Cotswold Wayfeatures in the   
 N-Wcorner of the block.
