		<content>{Basingstoke District Hospital,}in the 
 Hampshire Area Health Authority       
 (Teaching), was built in the extensive
 grounds of the former Park Prewett    
 Hospital, now known as Basingstoke    
 District Hospital Psychiatric         
 Division. The Maternity Unit was      
 completed first and served as a mini  
 District Hospital while work on the   
 main building was in progress. The    
 General Division with its many wards  
 and departments was officially opened 
 in 1975 by H.R.H. Princess Alexandra. 
 On the same site is the ambulance     
 station for the area, residences for  
 doctors and nurses, sports fields and 
 a golf course. There are no doctors   
 surgeries in the area. There is one   
 full time dentist's surgery and two   
 other dentists practice part time in  
 their own homes.
