		<title>06Lunch Time</title>
		<content> At 12 o clock we have our school lunch
 time. We line up at the classroom door
 and go through the Infants class. We  
 go through the corridor and into the  
 toilets. We wash our hands and dry    
 them with a paper towel. Then we      
 get our lunchboxes. When we are all in
 the dining room we stand behind our   
 chairs and say our prayers, which is  
 saying Thank you to God. Then we sit  
 down. Our table has 4 people on it.   
 There is a lot of noise usually       
 because we all talk to each other, (or
 rather shout at each other). My mum is
 a dinnerlady and she looks after us at
 lunchtime. For my lunch I sometimes   
 have ham in my sandwiches. I have     
 orange juice, a chocolate covered     
 biscuit, crisps and a yoghurt as      
 well.
