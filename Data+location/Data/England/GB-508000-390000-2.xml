		<content>  This area of{Middle Rasen}has,       
 disecting it into two halves,  the{A46
 (Grimsby to Lincoln) road running in a
 north-south direction. The road       
 follows the western edge of the       
 Lincolnshire Wolds. Off the A46, going
 westwards, is the{A1103,}the main road
 to Gainsborough. A few{minor roads    
 connect these main roads with farms   
 and the communities of Middle Rasen,  
 Osgodby and Walesby.                  
  Just under one kilometre from the A46
 and running parallel to it is the     
 single track{railway}line from Lincoln
 to the Humber Bank towns of Grimsby,  
 Cleethorpes, Scunthorpe and Immingham.
 A 125 High Speed service to London    
 uses this route daily and other       
{passenger}services connect with all   
 parts of the country.{Frieght}trains  
 to and from the Humber Industries use 
 the line regularly.                   </content>
