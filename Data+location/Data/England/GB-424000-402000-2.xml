		<title>02WEATHER IN PENISTONE</title>
		<content> Part of Penistone's{ecology}is of     
 course its weather.Penistone and its  
 surrounding villages has more than 60%
 over cast weather.Penistone is        
 surrounded by the Pennine Hills so    
{rain}is enevitable. Our winters are   
 very harsh and a foot of{snow}is not  
 uncommon.A good summer is often       
 followed by a bad winter.Last winter  
 (1984) was very mild although we had a
 fairly good summer. At my school      
 Penistone Grammar we have snow drills,
 this when the snow gets so bad our    
 homes may be cut off. This is         
 mainly for people living in out-lying 
 villages. In short Pennine weather is 
 generally bad.
