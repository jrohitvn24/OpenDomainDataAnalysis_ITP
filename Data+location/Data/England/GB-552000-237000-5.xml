 Apart from going on holiday people    
 travel out of Saffron Walden to work  
 or to go shopping. To the west of our 
 area ia Audley End Railway Station.   
 This is on the London to Cambridge    
 line. Many of the men and some of the 
 women who live in Saffron Walden work 
 in London. Those who do not travel so 
 far work in Harlow, Bishop's Stortford
 or Cambridge. These are people with   
 white collar managerial and executive 
 jobs.                                 
 People go to other towns to           
 shop."Doing a Sainsburys" is becoming 
 part of the language. People go to    
 Cambridge to buy upto Â£100 of food at 
 a time from the Sainsburys in         
 Cambridge where there is a large car  
 park. For clothes many people prefer  
 Cambridge or Harlow . There is more   
 choice there and Harlow is cheaper.   </content>
