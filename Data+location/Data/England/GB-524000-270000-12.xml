		<title>12POLICEMAN IN HUNTINGDON.</title>
		<content> When we interviewed P.C.Woods he told 
 us that he has three shifts.Mornings, 
 from O6:OO to 14:OO, afternoons from  
 14:OO _ 22:OO and nights 22:OO to     
 O6:OO.If the force are busy they are  
 asked to work 12 hour shifts.The first
 thing he does is to listen to the     
 chief Constable who instructs the     
 constables about what has been        
 happening, what to look for, and their
 daily task.The men then go out and    
 either walk around the streets or     
 drive the panda cars.P.C Woods        
 summarised his job as helping the     
 public, protecting life and looking   
 after peoples property.He said the    
 main aim of the police was to prevent 
 crime.Much of his day was spent in    
 the local area dealing with complaints
 about other people and accidents.
