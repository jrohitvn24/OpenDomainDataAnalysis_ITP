		<content> There is very little opportunity for  
 employment within the village apart   
 from a small engineering unit. Most   
 wage earners are professional people  
 and work in Cambridge. A small number 
 of families rely on the farms for     
 employment.                           
                                       
 There is a number of small (in some   
 cases one-man) businesses such as     
 landscaping, thatching, plumbing,     
 hairdressing and various              
 consultancies. In many households both
 husband and wife are wage-earners; a  
 small number of wives do domestic     
 work, but again most commute.
