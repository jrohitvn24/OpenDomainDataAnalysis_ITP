The one kilometre square that we are   
looking at doesn,t have much grass in  
it, apart from the obvious ; people,s  
back gardens, thats square if they have
any. the landscape of our square is    
mainly full of houses shops and a      
couple of industrial places .In my     
view the main part of our square is    
probably the hospital.The main part of 
the area is on the side of a hill.     
the roads where all the shops are      
Trafalger road and woolwich road are   
fairly grotty and grimy with the fumes 
from the power station and other nealy 
places with chimneys. I think this area
could be improved as it is not the     
nices place in the world to go         
shopping.The area on the
