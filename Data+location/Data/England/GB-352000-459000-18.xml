The grouse moor is 12,000 acres.This   
year the Duke has been shooting the    
full six days but it usually depends on
how busy he is.The average number of   
grouse shot in a day depends on the    
weather.There are normally 8 people in 
a shooting party with two teams of     
beaters each of 12 people.The beaters  
move around the area and beat the      
bushes to make the birds come out of   
them.The shooters then shoot the birds 
as they fly off.                       
      The hours Mr Ozerkowski works    
depends entirely on what season it is. 
He has had the job as a gamekeeper for 
5 years part time and this is his 2nd  
year full time.The busiest month for   
shooting is August.He has always been  
interested in wildlife,therefore       
gamekeeping seemed the perfect job for 
him and he thoroughly enjoys it.       </content>
