		<title>20Glebe Farm Hanworth (cont.)</title>
		<content> Over 200 acres of top quality land    
produce sugar-beet,winter wheat,spring 
and winter barley,dwarf-beans and      
potatoes. Sugar-beet is sowed on       
contract to the Royal Sugar-Beet       
cooperation. 60 acres barley are sold  
to the malting industry while the      
winter wheat is sold for animal feed.  
Beans are harvested by the local       
farmerÂ£s cooperative for freezing,while
potatoes also grown under contract are 
sold to Ross freezers for chips,or on  
open market after being stored till    
April and graded. Fodder beet is grown 
for sheep and cattle while extract     
from the malting of barley is bought   
back for cattle feed. All straw is used
for winter bedding for cattle,pigs and 
sheep. Because of the vast amount of   
modern machinery, this farm is self-   
sufficient and is worked by the farmer,
his wife,2 sons and 2 employees.       </content>
