		<title>01SOUTH-WEST OF SHREWSBURY</title>
		<content> The block is a rural area.The industry
 is either farming or trades connected 
 with the land. People not working in  
 the area travel into Shrewsbury to    
 work either by bus,car or motorcycle. 
 There is only one major settlement    
 which is Pontesbury.  The other small 
 areas of habitation have grown from   
 the times when the manors controlled  
 the land. There is very little        
 property development allowed in this  
 area.                                 
 The area has little or no amenities   
 although the population enjoys a      
 reasonably active and interesting     
 life. Unemployment is low and social  
 functions held in the various village 
 halls are well supported.One has a    
 daily playgroup for under fives, a    
 luncheon club for the elderly,the     
 amateur dramatic club,a weekly youth  
 club besides the scout and guide meets</content>
