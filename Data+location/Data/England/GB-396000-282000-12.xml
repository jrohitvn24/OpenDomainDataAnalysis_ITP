		<title>12Halesowen Police Station</title>
		<content>    Halesowen Police Station was built 
 12 years ago to replace the old       
 building. It has the only police      
 driving school in the whole of the    
 West Midlands. The constables take a  
 gruelling test after ten weeks. They  
 also have pounds for stray animals    
 which are picked up by the R.S.P.C.A. 
 within 24 hours if the owners have    
 not claimed them. They also train     
 thirty police dogs and handlers which 
 takes ten weeks. There are 125 police 
 in the station and about 12 are women.
    Prisoners can be taken straight to 
 the magistrates court through a tunnel
 which links it to the station. The    
 police can only be identified by      
 identification cards and numbers.     
    Community Crimewatch groups have   
 been formed to watch for any signs of 
 trouble and report this to the police.
