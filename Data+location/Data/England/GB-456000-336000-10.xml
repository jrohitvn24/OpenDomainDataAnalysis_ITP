		<content>    Most of the people we interviewed  
 live in{Wilford.}Many people have     
 lived here for a long time. Most      
 people said they liked Wilford, but   
 all for different reasons- it is near 
 to the river, it is near to the city  
 atmosphere but has a countryside      
 feeling. Most of the people we spoke  
 to were not born in Wilford. Some     
 people thought that Wilford could be  
 improved by having a doctor and other 
 health services near. Most people     
 thought that the community spirit was 
 most important to people because they 
 chose to live here. There were mixed  
 opinions about whether people liked   
 the shops. Most people did not have a 
 job in Wilford but worked in the area 
 around it. Most people found Wilford a
 very pleasant place in which to live.
