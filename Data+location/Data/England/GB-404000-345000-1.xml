		<content>  Cotton lies to the East of Cheadle   
and is situated on the lower slopes of 
the Weaver Hills,about 8OO ft.above sea
level,on the Staffordshire Moorlands.  
 Close by is the River Churnet which is
fed by the stream from Cotton Dell,a   
narrow wooded glen,where many unusual  
birds like Nuthatchers,Tree Creepers,  
Greater Spotted Woodpeckers and Jays   
are found.  Some parts of the area are 
composed of Limestone and Millstone    
Grit and others of Red Sandstone,which,
being porous,ensures a high degree of  
dryness after heavy rain. Agriculture  
is the chief occupation but Extractive 
Industry (British Industrial Sand) is  
also present. Population is sparse but 
there are an abundance of trees and    
fields in this very hilly area with    
some roads being as steep as 1 in 5 and
with very little in the way of public  
transport.                             </content>
