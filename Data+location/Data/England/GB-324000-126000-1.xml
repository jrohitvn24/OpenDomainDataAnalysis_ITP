		<title>01GENERAL SUMMARY</title>
		<content>  Most of our area is farmland.It is   
 mainly dairy farming.However,cereal   
 crops such as wheat,corn and barley   
 are grown;strawberries,raspberries,and
 blackberries are retailed;sheep,pigs, 
 hens and beef cattle are reared;plants
 and shrubs are sold for gardens;cider-
 apple orhards are also to be found.   
  Quite a lot of people in Taunton own 
 horses and one farm is used to provide
 homes for owners with little land.    
  In our area we have many villages:   
 Cheddon Fitzpaine, Creech St Michael, 
 Monkton Heathfield,West Monkton,Creech
 Heathfield and Bathpool.There are also
 a number of hamlets such as Langaller,
 Goosenford and Overton.               
  Although it is only a few miles from 
 the busy town of Taunton it is a very 
 peaceful community.There are many old 
 people which is probably the reason   
 why it is so quiet.                   </content>
