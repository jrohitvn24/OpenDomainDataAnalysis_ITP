		<content> Families in this area live in a       
 mixture of private and rented         
 accomodation. In Delves Lane and      
 Crookhall there are former Colliery   
 bungalows now in the main privately   
 owned due to mine closures in the     
 1960's.                               
 Recent Government legislation has     
 encouraged many families to buy their 
 Council houses. A good deal of        
 revitalisation of Council and private 
 property has taken place in all parts 
 of this area and this is an on going  
 operation.{Slum clearance}especially  
 in Consett has led to the creation of 
 space for new houses, which are       
 currently under construction. Old     
 peoples sheltered accomodation is     
 available under direction of the local
 Council and the Anchor Housing Assoc. 
 Blackhill has modern houses  on land  
 once overshadowed by the steelworks.  </content>
