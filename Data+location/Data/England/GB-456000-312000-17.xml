		<content> I have a family of four: my Mum,Dad,  
 my brother and myself.We get up and   
 have breakfast all together.We eat    
 toast,some times Kelloggs Corn Flakes 
 and have a cup of tea.I go and clean  
 my teeth, wash and get dressed.I brush
 my hair and turn the radio on to      
 Radio Leicester.I walk to school      
 stopping to collect Emily and feed    
 a goat!Then I go to the Hall,sing and 
 pray. Then we do English,Maths, Topic 
 ,cooking ,clay,swimming and           
 needlework.I have a form teacher but  
 we move round to different teachers.  
 When I get home I change into a       
 skirt,blouse,dress or tracksuit.Some  
 nights I go dancing,on others I go    
 cross-country running with my         
 teacher.On Thursday I listen to Pop   
 Music and my best Pop group is Wham!  
 Then I read comics and books.I also   
 watch TV - I like Eastenders.         </content>
