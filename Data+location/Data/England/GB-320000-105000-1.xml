{Upottery}is situated in the {Otter    
{valley,}6 miles North-East of the     
 market town of{Honiton. }With its     
 neighbouring village of{Rawridge}it is
 the main area of population and has   
 more ameneties than the rest of the   
 vicinity which formed our survey      
 area. The majority of land in the area
 is used for agricultural purposes.    
{ Upottery} has a number of interesting
 buildings which tell us some of the   
 history.The pub is called{The Sidmouth
{Arms}after the former owner of the    
 manor {Lord Sidmouth }who was the     
 Prime Minister from 1801 to 1804.     
  The Manor house is no longer standing
 but there is a farm known as Manor    
 Farm and this was once a Bank issuing 
 its own bank notes.                   
  The village also has a Justice Room  
 where a court was once held.          </content>
