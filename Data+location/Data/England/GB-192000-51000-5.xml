		<content> Some families have lived generation   
 upon generation in the same area,and  
 for many children tracing their       
 ancestral roots is a simple exercise. 
 It is not unusual for pupils to share 
 their lessons with their relatives(in 
 fact a couple of pupils in the        
 secondary school are related to a     
 teacher) and for many it is accepted  
 that they will,as a matter of course  
 happen upon their grandparents,uncles,
 aunties and cousins in a single       
 day.Such closeness has its advantages 
 &amp; disadvantages,but generally the     
 young people must enjoy it,as few     
 people want to leave when they grow   
 up.{LANGUAGE,}We could not find one   
 fluent speaker of Cornish,but despite 
 this,many Cornish words are familiar  
 as they occur in place names and      
 surnames e.g. Bodinnick,Tolgarrick,   
 Tregargus,Trelion and Tresweeta.      </content>
