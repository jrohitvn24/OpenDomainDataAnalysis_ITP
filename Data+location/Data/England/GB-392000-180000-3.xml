		<title>03Seagry House Fire.</title>
		<content> On May the 8TH 1949 there was a fire  
 in Seagry House.A week before the fire
 started the butler left and a new     
 butler came,his name was Mr.Head.The  
 previous butler Mr.Brentnor had a     
 routine.Just before Lady Cowley       
 retired for the night he checked that 
 the fire in her room was safe and that
 no lighted cigarettes were left around
 because Lady Cowley was a chain       
 smoker.This new butler didn't have a  
 routine.Therefore on May 8th we think 
 that Lady Cowley went to sleep in the 
 chair with a cigarette in her hand.The
 butler went to open the door and the  
 handle was red hot and he burnt his   
 hand and then the flames flared up in 
 his face.The fire was so big that     
 people in Wootton Bassett saw it.Fire 
 engines came from Wootton             
 Bassett,Malmesbury and Chippenham.
