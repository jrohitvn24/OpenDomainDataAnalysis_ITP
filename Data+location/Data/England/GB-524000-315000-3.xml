		<title>03FARMING AROUND COWBIT</title>
		<content>      The farmers around Cowbit usually
 start work at about 7:30am.Mister     
 Banks has the largest area,1500 acres 
 of which are cereals.                 
      In our area the most popular     
 crops are cereals, sugar beet,        
 vegetables and flowers. The land is   
 mostly owned by farms and             
 nurseries.There are very few animals  
 except for some cattle and sheep.We   
 have one farmer, Mr. Cooke, who breeds
 Shire horses and has won many major   
 prizes at Wembley, the Royal Show and 
 the Lincolnshire Show.                
      The farmers in the area own a    
 variety of machinery ranging from     
 tractors to various harvesters.       
      The farms tend to be a family    
 concern and staff are usually part of 
 the family with a few seasonal        
 helpers.
