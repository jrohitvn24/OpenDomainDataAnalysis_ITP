		<content>    Porthleven Shipyard is not really a
 shipyard. It used to be but it isn't  
 now. It is more of an industrial      
 estate these days and has all sorts of
 things going on in the buildings.     
 There are twenty-five buildings       
 altogether. Nine of them are vacant,  
 the others are rented by small        
 businesses. There is a river running  
 next to it which used to give the     
 electricity to the shipyard. Its power
 was harnessed by turning a water      
 wheel. The water wheel has been taken 
 away now, but you can still see where 
 it was. Most of the buildings are     
 rented out by local people who start  
 small businesses. They are used for   
 things like building supplies, service
 places for cars and motor-bikes and   
 store-houses for fishermen. Its got   
 quite a busy atmosphere and most of   
 its occupants are friendly.           </content>
