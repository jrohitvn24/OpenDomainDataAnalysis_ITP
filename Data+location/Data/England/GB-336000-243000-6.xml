		<content> WORK IN THE STAUNTON ON WYE           
 The main local employers are Bulmers  
 and Sun Valley intensive poultry. A   
 small plastics factory employs a few  
 local workers, as does the Oakchurch  
 PYO fruit farm. Other local farms are 
 largely mechanized and employ just 1  
 or 2 workers. There are 2 motor       
 mechanics working alone. In Mansell   
 Gamage and Byford the largest employer
 is Garnons  with a labour force of    
 27, divided between farm, maintenance 
 and woodlands. Most other work is in  
 Hereford 8 miles away, in factories,  
 shops or offices. Sun Valley employ   
 local women in their Hereford factory,
 transporting them in their own bus.   
 There is some seasonal work such as   
 fruit and daffodil picking.
