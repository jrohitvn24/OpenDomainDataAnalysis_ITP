		<content> Parkgate, which is an area south of   
 Rawmarsh, is in a development zone.   
 The steel works which were a prominent
 feature of the landscape have all been
 demolished, leaving areas of derelict 
 land. Streets of terraced houses which
 had been built at the end of the 19th 
 century for the workers in the        
 growing steel and coal industries,    
 have also been demolished. New light  
 industrial premises are being built   
 where once there were streets. Public 
 buildings such as chapels have also   
 been converted for commercial use.    
 Many of the shops, in a once thriving 
 shopping street, have been converted  
 to finance, building society, or      
 insurance offices, or banks. On the   
 road to Rotherham there are hills of  
 tipped industrial waste. There are    
 streets of derelict houses with       
 second hand shops packed with junk.   </content>
