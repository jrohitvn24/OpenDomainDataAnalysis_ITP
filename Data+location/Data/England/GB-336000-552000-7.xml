		<content> In each twenty four hour  day they    
 turn out approximatley ten thousand   
 tyres which are bought by nearly all  
 the major car companies in the world. 
 Many diffrent tyres are made most to  
 fit ordinary family cars but some for 
 very exotic sports cars such as those 
 made by the German company Porsche.In 
 fact over 60% of all the tyres made in
 Carlisle are destined for export to   
 other countries such as Sweden or     
 Japan.The company has a very active   
 social club which is widely used by   
 people in the area as the membership  
 is open to anyone who lives in the    
 area. It is seen as an important      
 socail asset by many people.
