		<content> At the time of the first Domesday     
 Book,Malvern Link was in the Manor of 
 Leigh and owned by the Abbey of       
 Pershore.  The Link "Walk" was part of
 Malvern Chase and had its own keeper. 
 The oldest monument in Malvern Link is
 the "Whore" Stone or old stone. It was
 already old in 1584 when situated at  
 Link Top, junction of Newtown Road,   
 but in 1744 it was at the junction of 
 Pickersleigh Road and Worcester       
 Road.In shape it is a cube with a     
 groove on the top. This is probably   
 for coins. It probably received       
 payments for the right to cross from  
 Powick into Leigh. It now rests inside
 the Hampden Road entrance to S.       
 Matthias' churchyard.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
