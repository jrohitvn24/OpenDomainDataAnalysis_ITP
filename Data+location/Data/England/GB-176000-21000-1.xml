 The Manacles are a group of rocks off 
 Manacle Point. They show up a lot at  
 low tide but at high tide only a few  
 tips can be seen.  There is a warning 
 bell buoy.  Each rock has an          
 individual name.  Fishing is very good
 here but obviously dangerous.  One of 
 the worst wrecks was the {Mohegan} in 
 1898 when 106 people were drowned. 44 
 were rescued by the Porthoustock      
 Life-boat.  Another ship, the John,   
 was wrecked on the outer Manacles and 
 190 died.  The survivors were rescued 
 by the Coverack Life-boat. The        
 Manacles have claimed local lives too.
 Divers today use this area a lot for  
 collecting memorabilia.  There are    
 many wrecks too numerous to mention.
