		<title>11INDUSTRIES IN HELMSHORE.</title>
		<content> Over the years industries have changed
 a lot. All industries used to be      
 cotton mills like Higher Mill museum. 
 Most of Helmshore's industries are on 
 Holcombe road. There are many         
 factories that make lots of strange   
 things like X-Ray protection, paper   
 products and many other things. Once  
 Helmshore was a little village which  
 had two cotton mills where nearly     
 everybody worked. Today the industries
 are much more varied in their         
 products.                             
                                       
 On Holcombe Road there is a motor     
 vehicle dismantlers, two welding      
 shops, a textile manufacturer, a paper
 producer, and two garages.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
