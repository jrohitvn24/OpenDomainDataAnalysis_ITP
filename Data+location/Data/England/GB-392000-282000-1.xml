 area of houses.From Victorian terraces
 to modern developments.               
 Cradley is a small suburb of Halesowen
 bounded by a "Green belt" area.It has 
 a number of light industries and is   
 traditionally connected with heavy    
 metal industry.                       
 Another suburb of Halesowen is Hasbury
 which has a bypass along its southern 
 edge; it includes a quarry from which 
 sandstone was taken to build Halesowen
 Parish Church.                        
 Lutley has developed since the early  
 1970's into a vast housing            
 development for commuters to          
 Birmingham.It still keeps its rural   
 charm.
