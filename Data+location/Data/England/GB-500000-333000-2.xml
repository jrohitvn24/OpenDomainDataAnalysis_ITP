		<content> Braceby and Sapperton both have a Post
 Office{letter box. Mail}is delivered  
 to each house six days a week (not    
 Sundays) by van from Sleaford. A      
 collection of outgoing mail is made   
 from the boxes at the same time. Both 
 villages have a{public telephone      
 kiosk. These have been considered un- 
 economic by British Telecom but       
 residents have campaigned to retain   
 them for people who do not have a     
{private telephone}and especially for  
 use in emergencies both by residents  
 and passers-by. So, at present, they  
 are still in use but the minimum      
 charge for a call has now risen to ten
 pence. Only one house in Braceby is   
 without a telephone. The farms use    
{radio}transmission to pass messages   
 to the men working in the fields from 
 the farmhouse. Three businesses based 
 here use{micro computers.             </content>
