		<content> There are one hundred and thirty      
 children spread over four classes,we  
 have got five teachers,(two are part  
 time)plus one head teacher,makes six. 
 The school consists of two infant     
 classes,which are Victorian,and two   
 junior classes which were built in the
 early nineteen sixties.School lasts   
 from nine o'clock till half past      
 three.At lunch time the majority eat a
 packed lunch and the minority eats a  
 hot dinner.I am in the top class.We   
 usually do maths,english,music,       
 Physical Exersize,science,R.E. and    
 reading.Reading is my favourite       
 subject.I read Fighting Fantasy.These 
 are "choose your own adventure" books.
 I sit next to Martin and Nicky.There  
 are a couple of unsavoury characters  
 but most are O.K.
