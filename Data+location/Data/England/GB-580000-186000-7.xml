		<title>07Public Pressure:open spaces.</title>
		<content>   Unrestricted public access to woods 
 and other open spaces which are all so
 close to urban areas creates many     
 conflicts with conservation measures. 
 Wildlife disturbance is not excessive 
 in Belfairs Nature Reserve itself     
 because it is fenced, but it is a     
 severe problem in other woods.        
 Uncontrolled dogs, children, motor    
 cyclists, BMX riders and air gunners  
 are a constant problem. Fires, damage 
 to equipment, glue sniffing and       
 rubbish dumping are common.           
   Farmers report similar problems,    
 particularly those whose land is      
 easily visible from roads. One local  
 farmer reports pressure too from both{
 local organisations who want to stage 
 events on his land and from local     
 residents who object.
