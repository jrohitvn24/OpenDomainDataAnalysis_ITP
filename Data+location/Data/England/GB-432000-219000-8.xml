		<content>  The area around Charlbury is mostly  
agricultural with barley,wheat and     
oilseed rape as the main crops.There is
also quite a bit of woodland which     
provides cover for pheasants and       
partridges as well as foxes, rabbits   
and hares.The undulating roads have    
hedges or stone walls alongside them   
and the area is criss crossed by public
footpaths.                             
  This area is quite hilly and         
Charlbury is surrounded by the Cotswold
villages of Chadlington,Spelsbury,Dean,
Taston,Fawler,Finstock and Leafield.   
  At Dean there is a new waste disposal
site where people dump rubbish.        
  From Wychwood Forest,which contains  
Cornbury House and Park, there are     
extensive views over the Evenlode      
Valley and the West Oxfordshire        
Cotswolds.
