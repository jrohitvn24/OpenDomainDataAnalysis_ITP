		<title>06ENERGY USE IN KILTARLITY</title>
		<content> Electricity is the main energy source 
 for domestic needs.All the power      
 supply cables are overhead,as in most 
 areas served by the North of Scotland 
 Hydro-Electricity Board.The scattered 
 nature of the housing would make      
 underground power cables too          
 expensive.Only a few of the most      
 remote houses do not have mains       
 electricity and depend on diesel      
 generators.In the school's survey of  
 51 houses,25% used a second energy    
 source such as paraffin or bottled gas
 (there is no mains gas in the area).  
 40% of houses surveyed used wood as   
 well as coal for heating,with coal    
 being the single most popular domestic
 fuel. The few industrial users in the 
 area e.g. the sawmill and builders    
 yards depend on electricity,most of   
 which comes from nearby Kilmorack     
 Hydro-electric power station.         </content>
