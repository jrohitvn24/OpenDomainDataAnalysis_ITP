		<content>     The village is three miles north  
 of Chippenham,and two miles south-west
 of Junction 17 on the{M4 Motorway.    
     It has one main street which is   
 quite straight. It is about half a    
 mile long from one end to the other.  
 This main street is simply called     
 Kington St.Michael.                   
     The name Kington comes from the   
 fact that this area of land once      
 belonged to the King. In Saxon times  
 there is a record that{King           
{Athelstan,}in 943 A.D., gave a parcel 
 of land called Kington to one of his  
 officers called Atheline.             
     Some time later, between 1235 and 
 1253, Michael of Amesbury,who was then
 Abbot of{Glastonbury,}had the Church  
 re-dedicated to his name saint, St.   
 Michael. This is how the village got  
 its full name of Kington St.Michael.
