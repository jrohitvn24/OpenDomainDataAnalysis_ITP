		<title>15SKIPSEA CASTLE</title>
		<content> Skipsea Castle is well preserved so   
 far as it's earthworks are concerned. 
 It was built by Dru de la Beuvriere   
 soon after the Norman Conquest. The   
 motte is forty-six feet in height and 
 was originally an island separated    
 from the bailey to which it was       
 connected by a timber bridge.The      
 sheet of water was known as the mere  
 of Skipsea. It was demolished in 1220 
 in the reign of Henry III.            
 Today,the motte is a hill on which    
 about a dozen trees are growing. Only 
 a small section of stone wall remains.
 From the top,you have a good view all 
 around. You can see Flamboro'Head and 
 many miles inland. The ancient British
 earthworks still almost surround the  
 motte. There is a legend that if you  
 run around the motte 7 times while    
 the church bell rings midnight then   
{OLD MOLLIE}(a ghost) will appear.     </content>
