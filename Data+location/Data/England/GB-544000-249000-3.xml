		<content> It was first built in 1179 and the    
 rector was Andrew.The church was      
 rebuilt in 1396 and at that stage     
 Thomous Patesly was the vicar.In 1798 
 the church tower fell and when being  
 rebuilt it was shortened by one bay.  
    Christopher Herbert was made vicar 
 in 1978 and still is today.The church 
 has seven services a week and four of 
 these are on Sundays.The average      
 congregation is 48.There are five     
 bells which are still rung.There are  
 nine stained glass windows each with  
 an inscription at the bottom.         
    After recent excavations only few  
 fragments were found of the old       
 church.
