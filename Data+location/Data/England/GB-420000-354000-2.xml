		<content> INDUSTRY - Quarries - There are three 
 quarries still in production -        
 Longcliffe,Bennetts and Tilcon.       
 The pattern of work has changed       
 dramatically. Stone is no longer      
 quarried by hand, powerful machinery  
 has taken the place of manual workers.
 There are many products in addition to
 stone for building and road           
 maintenance.  Ground limestone is used
 in argriculture for fertilization,    
 manufacture of animal feed, chemistry,
 glass,asphalt,sugar refining and      
 rubber products.   All transport is by
 road, hence many men are employed as  
 lorry and tanker drivers.             
 HOBEN no longer make fire bricks,     
 silica &amp; ganister products are made   
 for the use of steel works.           
 SPENCER BROS. a small family firm -

 which is used in the lining of furnace</content>
