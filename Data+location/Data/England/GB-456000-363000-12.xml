		<content>  to improve the estate in several     
 ways, the major improvement being the 
 planning of an adventure playground.  
 It was to be called the Newlands      
 Project.                              
  The play area was officially opened  
 on August 16th 1984. The area is      
 landscaped and very well designed for 
 children of all ages. There are four  
 play areas with pathways between, the 
 ground being covered with a thick     
 layer of wood chippings which are both
 safe and clean. Tha adventure play    
 equipment is imaginatively designed   
 and vandal-proof, our favourite piece 
 being the realistic jeep made from    
 tubular steel and real tyres. There   
 are swings, wooden 'gym' equipment and
 a metal tank and helicopter for       
 adventure play. There is a football   
 pitch,concrete area,safe slides,seats,
 and litter bins.We enjoyed this survey</content>
