		<title>16A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ...</title>
		<content> Hopeful of at least one dry day I went
 for a walk up Whernside, a 'hill'     
 near Settle, one of the{'Three Peaks'.
 We got up at about 7.10. I had my     
 breakfast, and packed my rucksack with
 lunch, a bottle of water, and some    
 useful clothes. We met our friends    
 for the walk, a family from Hull, at  
 Horton in Ribblesdale, at about       
 11.10am. We set off soon afterwards,  
 and walked a steady six miles uphill  
 before we ate our sandwiches by a     
 waterfall. After setting off again, we
 traversed the summit through mud and  
 bog before descending the opposite    
 face. We then crossed some fields     
 before rejoining our original path    
 under the famous Ribblehead viaduct.  
 We travelled back to the cars, and set
 off home. On arrival, we fed the dog, 
 and I climbed into bed to listen to   
 'Into the Music' on Radio 1.          </content>
