		<content>{BRITISH BULLDOG }- This game is very  
 popular particularly with the cubs and
 scouts.  A person is chosen to be     
 "up". He stands in the middle of the  
 playing area while all the others     
 stand on one side or the other.  When 
 they are told to go they have to run  
 across to the other side.  The person 
 who is "up" must try to catch         
 them,lift them up and shout"British   
 Bulldog".  When they are caught they  
 join the "catcher".  The game         
 continues until  there is only one    
 person left.  He is the winner.       
{FOX AND HOUNDS }- In this game two    
 teams are chosen.  One team is the    
 foxes and the other is the hounds. The
 fox team runs away and hides while the
 hounds count to 50.  The hounds then  
 go to seek out and catch the foxes    
 before they can get "home".
