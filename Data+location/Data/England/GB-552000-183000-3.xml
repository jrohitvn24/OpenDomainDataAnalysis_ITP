		<content> In my area Hacton School has Brownies 
 every Wednesday night.  My sister is  
 going soon.  There is a field down the
 bottom of my road and down the other  
 side of my road there is a park for   
 younger children.  My neighbour spends
 his time in the garden and my other   
 neighbour takes their dogs down the   
 field every week.  My mum spends time 
 in the garden weeding and she also    
 does the cooking.  My dad spends his  
 time planting seed in his little bit  
 of garden. I spend my time sewing or  
 helping in the garden.  My sister     
 helps me or starts playing.  My       
 brother usually goes round the block  
 on his bike with his friends.
