		<title>07Road Transport in Cattistock</title>
		<content> Cattistock is nine miles from the     
 nearest town.   Majority of households
 own at least one car.   Many          
 under-21's now also own cars and young
 people often ride motorbikes.         
 Elderly people rely largely on public 
 transport.                            
 Family-owned garage in the village    
 provides an excellent bus service,    
 petrol and servicing for cars.   Daily
 services to Dorchester, Yeovil and    
 Bridport, weekly service to Sherborne.
 School buses to Maiden Newton         
 (primary) and Beaminster (secondary); 
 but scant public transport to         
 Beaminster out of school hours.  No   
 evening or Sunday services;  no old   
 age pensioner fare concessions, but   
 general subsidized fares.             
 Bus company provides day trips,       
 holidays in England and abroad, and   
 visits to sports and theatres.        </content>
