		<title>16AGRICULTURE IN CH.MINSHULL</title>
		<content> In our designated area there are 10   
 farms, farming 2,000 acres. 90% is    
 grassland and 10% arable.             
{CATTLE}There are 1640 fresian cattle, 
 including calves up to 3 months  200  
           cows and heifers      1290  
           cattle reared for beef 150  
 Two of the herds are pedigree, the    
 rest commercial. The cattle are fed on
{silage.}Silage cutting (2 or 3 cuts   
 per year) is contracted out on all but
 two farms and is kept in clamps rather
 than silage towers.{Concentrates}are  
 all bought in from local mills except 
 by those farmers who produce corn, who
 feed their own barley  to their young 
 stock. Dairy cows receive an average  
 of 1.7Kg concentrates to every  4.5lt 
 milk produced.The{annual yield}per cow
 is approx. 6,000lt. All farmers use   
 modern milking parlours. All milk is  
 collected by the Milk Marketing Board.</content>
