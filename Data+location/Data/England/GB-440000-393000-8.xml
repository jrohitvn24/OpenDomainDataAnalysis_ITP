		<content> Interview.Alan Rhodes.                
 How do you spend your time now at     
 home?   "Well,I potter around the     
 house,do the gardening or watch TV.   
  If the weather's nice then I take the
 dog for a long walk to get away from  
 the house. If it's raining you are    
 just sat in the house bored doing     
 nothing I only go to the pub once a   
 week,and then only spend a bit of     
 money".We asked him how much he gets  
 he answered "Â£54.00,".I think that    
 Alan must be very unhappy and bored   
 because he has to stay in the house   
 all the time when it's wet. "I'd      
 sooner have a job," he said.          
  He thinks there will be no change. It
 will take a long time and they havent 
 got enough time left.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
