		<title>14The River Derwent</title>
		<content> The River Derwent is a fairly wide    
 river with high energy which has      
 caused meanders, to slow the river    
 down. The river comes from Derwent    
 Water and the surrounding catchment   
 area and flows towards Cockermouth    
 where the river Cocker merges with it.
 It then continues on its way to       
 Workington and the sea. The river is  
 in a wide valley, it does not fill the
 valley bottom but bends from side to  
 side as it flows from the north east  
 corner of the area to the south west  
 corner.                               
     On one section of the river bank  
 there is a bad patch of soil erosion. 
 This was caused by the trees on the   
 bank being cut down by the owner of   
 Isel Hall in 1983.                    
     There is a weir which crosses the 
 river near the hospital.
