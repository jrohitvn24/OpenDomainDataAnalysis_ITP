		<title>10THE GARDEN SHOP,ALLET,TRURO.</title>
		<content> Two Burrows Garden Shop sells garden  
 plants, cut flowers &amp; vegetables.  Of 
 the 10 acres, 5 are cultivated, some  
 under glass, 5 are rough grass which  
 the owner's son will drain &amp; develop. 
 The owners live in Threemilestone,    
 having tried for 14 years to obtain   
 planning permission for a dwelling at 
 the Allet site; this has now been     
 granted for their son to build a      
 bungalow. The shop is a family concern
 &amp; employs 1 girl, formerly a Youth    
 Training Scheme student.The wide range
 of produce is attractively displayed  
 on stalls with a small parking area   
 beside the B3284.  It attracts passing
 trade, &amp; many regular shoppers from   
 several miles around. The owners enjoy
 meeting lots of people. Work involves 
 all aspects of gardening &amp; selling.In 
 the words of the owners,"it's all work
 &amp; no pay!".....but enjoyable.         </content>
