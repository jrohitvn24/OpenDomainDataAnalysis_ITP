		<content>  Horse riding is not quite as popular 
 but that's because not many people    
 have horses.Skate boarding is second  
 to least favourite and skate boarding 
 was the craze the other               
 year. A skate board is a board of wood
 with four small wheels on the bottom  
 two at each end.People balance on it  
 and push themselves along and         
 sometimes do some trick on it.Playing 
 on your computer is the least popular 
 and thats probably because when they  
 first got a computer they played on it
 so much that they got a bit bored with
 it and didn't play on it much after.  
 Anyway only 21 children have got      
 their own computers out of the 43     
 children I asked.
