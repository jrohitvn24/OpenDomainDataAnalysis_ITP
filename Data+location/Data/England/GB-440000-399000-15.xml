		<content> The average{size of a family}is four  
 and one girl described her life at    
 home as" Pretty hectic,arguments are  
 always occuring.                      
 This sometimes leads to the slamming  
 of doors and i am sure that other     
 families have the same                
 problems.Arguments usually happen over
 which T.V.channel each of us want     
 to watch or remarks that we say to    
 each other.Family life can also be    
 very happy especially on{special      
{occasions}such as                     
 birthdays,Christmas,anniversaries,etc.
 ".There are many{fashions}around the  
 area at the moment,with the younger   
 population taking the lead.Skin tight 
 jeans and mini-skirts are still       
 popular with the girls (and boys). The
 punk craze is still lingering on - but
 not so conspicuous as in recent years.
