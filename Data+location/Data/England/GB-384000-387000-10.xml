		<title>10HOUSING IN CHEADLE.</title>
		<content>  THE AREA BETWEEN THE A34 AND THE     
 MANCHESTER TO STYAL RAILWAY LINE IS   
 QUITE MODERN, MOST OF THE HOUSES ARE  
 ABOUT 15 TO 20 YEARS OLD. THE HOUSES  
 IN THE SOUTHERN AREA ARE EITHER       
 DETATCHED HOUSES OR BUNGALOWS. THE    
 ROADS ARE USUALLY QUIET, HOWEVER, THE 
 FEW EXIT ROADS FROM THE ESTATE TEND TO
 BE BUSIER AND MORE DANGEROUS. THERE   
 ARE QUITE A FEW SHOPS SUCH AS         
 NEWSAGENTS AND GROCERS WHICH BETWEEN  
 THEM PROVIDE FOR MOST OF THE AREAS    
 NEEDS. IT IS ONLY FOR THEIR MAIN      
 WEEKLY FAMILY SHOPPING THAT           
   PEOPLE HAVE TO TRAVEL TO CENTRES    
 SUCH AS WYTHENSHAW, CHEADLE CENTRE OR 
 STOCKPORT. THE NEWSAGENTS SEEM TO USED
 MOST OFTEN BY CHILDREN FOR SWEETS AND 
 CHILDRENS MAGAZINES, ALTHOUGH MEN     
 CALL THERE IN THE MORNING OR IN THE   
 EVENING FOR PAPERS OR CIGARETTES.
