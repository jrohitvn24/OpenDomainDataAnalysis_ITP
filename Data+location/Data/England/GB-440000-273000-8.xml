		<content> Wolston St. Margaret's First School   
 provides{education}in two buildings,  
 the oldest situated in School Street  
 is called the Annexe. Outside toilets 
 are still in use and separate a grassy
 area from the tarmac playground. The{ 
{building}has been modernised with     
 lowered ceiling and oilfired central  
 heating. Nearly .4 of a mile away, is 
 the new building called Brookside the 
 first phase of which was opened in    
 1970. In 1974 a{nursery}class was     
 included but this meant a temporary   
 classroom unit being sited on the     
 playing field. The second phase is    
 still to be finished and campaigning  
 continues for a completion date. The  
 children wear a {school uniform}which 
 is red, white and grey and there is a 
 special striped school tie and a badge
 with St. Margaret's cross and the     
 dragon on it.                         </content>
