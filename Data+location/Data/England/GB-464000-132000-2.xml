 water had to be drawn from a well.    
 There was paraffin lighting and       
 cooking was done on a cold range.     
 People usually kept animals.          
      With no television, people       
 entertained themselves by playing     
 football, tennis and playing in the   
 woods.  Fetes and garden parties were 
 very small affairs.  There were very  
 few houses and no buses but very      
 infrequent trains.                    
      Four Marks School was very small.
  There were only two teachers.  The   
 Headmistress was called the Governess.
 Some of the boys stayed at school     
 until they were fourteen years old.   
      Cars were very rare in those     
 days.  Most people got around by      
 walking or cycling.
