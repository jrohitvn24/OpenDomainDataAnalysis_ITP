		<content> Our area covers 12 square kilometres. 
 These are the places: Burnham Overy   
 Staithe, Burnham Overy Town,          
 Peterstone Farm, Marsh House Farm,    
 Marsh Farm and Model Farm.  We have a 
 dismantled Railway, a dismantled Corn 
 Mill in Overy and a river called the  
 River Burn.  There was an old Hotel in
 Overy which is now closed down.  Our  
 12 kilometres also cover Holkham      
 Estate which is owned by the Cokes who
 are friends of the Royal Family.      
 Holkham Park is one of the finest     
 Parks in England.  Peterstone brick   
 works is still there but it is no     
 longer in use.  Holkham Church is in  
 the Park.  In Overy there was a school
 which has now been turned into the    
 village hall.  Most of our area is    
 marsh land.  In Overy there was an old
 swimming pool which is in the middle  
 of the creek.                         </content>
