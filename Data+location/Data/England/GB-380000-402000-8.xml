		<title>08HEATON PARK - EVENTS</title>
		<content> In 1982{Pope John Paul II}came to     
 Great Britain. We were very lucky     
 because he came to celebrate Mass in  
 Heaton Park. We remember his visit by 
 a monument which is situated in the   
 park. The monument is in the place    
 where the altar was standing during   
 Mass.                                 
                                       
 His Holiness John Paul II came to     
 Heaton Park on Monday 31st May 1982.  
 He left Speke Airport, Liverpool, and 
 landed  next to our school,{St.       
{Peter's R.C. High School.}The Pope    
 arrived at approximately 8.10 a.m.    
 Mass began at 8.35 a.m. It ended at   
 11.00 a.m. The Holy Father returned to
 Nazareth House at 11.40 a.m., and     
 departed for York at 1.05 p.m.
