 In the planting of the shelter belts  
the farmer has made an interesting     
discovery. After initially planting    
his new trees in grass, with limited   
success, a chance observation made him 
experiment with planting his new trees 
and shrubs in young wheat. This proved 
most successful, possibly due to the   
aeration of the soil by the wheat      
roots, protection from the sun afforded
by the mature wheat and the lack of    
matting by grass stems. With the       
addition of a plastic sack round the   
base of each sapling to repress weeds  
the resultant trees put on tremendous  
growth in their first year.            
 The farmer is frustrated by a lack of 
information as to which trees are best 
to encourage helpful insects.          
 A lake has been dug to encourage bird-
life which will assist pest control.   </content>
