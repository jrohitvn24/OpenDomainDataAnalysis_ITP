		<content> This is an interview with William     
 Streeter who was born on the 30th     
 March 1920. He lived in Blechingley   
 for 33 years and worked as a full time
 gardener for 8 hours each day. He has 
 also worked as a hospital fireman.    
 The hospital has been now replaced by 
 houses. He had to retire after 40     
 years of hospital service. He has     
 worked at other places and was a nurse
 during the Second World War. He lived 
 in the hospital grounds, walking to   
 work and seeing all of the hospital   
 life.
