		<content>   1985 is the year of the Diamond     
 Jubilee of the Hertfordshire Library  
 Service, which now has over 60        
 libraries issuing over 13 million     
 items a year. Libraries are gradually 
 being connected to a central computer 
 for the issue and return of books and 
 a computer catalogue will soon be     
 available. People in Hertfordshire    
 borrow 20% more books per head than   
 the average in Britain.               
   About 6,000 books (mostly Fiction,  
 Biography and History) are lent to    
 people in the Rickmansworth area each 
 week. More customers are female than  
 male; but this does not mean that more
 readers are female because they may be
 fetching books for other people.The   
 Library is open from 10a.m.to 7.30p.m.
 with a half day on Saturday. There are
 9 staff and they work a 5 day week.   
 The new library was opened in 1968.   </content>
