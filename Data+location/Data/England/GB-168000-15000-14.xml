		<title>14Ghosts and Superstitions</title>
		<content> In a house in St.Ruan a man saw a lady
 with a long white dress on.He thought 
 it was his wife but then he saw it was
 a nun and he could see right through  
 her.She disappeared into the          
 cellar.The house used to be a         
 priory.At Goonhilly on the pond there 
 is meant to be a big galleon which    
 goes past late at night.On Predannack 
 in the 19th century there was the     
 ghost of Thomas Flavel,former vicar of
 Mullion and rector of Ruan.The ghost  
 was exorcised by another vicar.       
 If you go fishing and see a rabbit or 
 talk about one you do not catch any   
 fish for the rest of the year.You have
 bad luck if you cut an elderberry     
 down,if you turn a horseshoe upside   
 down,if you break a mirror and the    
 year you are thirteen.If your ears go 
 red someone is talking about you.
