		<title>05A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A VET</title>
		<content> Wednesday 3rd. July 1985              
 The day began in a poulty processing  
 factory where my job was to make sure 
 that the meat produced was disease    
 free and hygienically processed.      
 After lunch I engaged in a small      
 animal surgery. The phone rang at 4   
 p.m._an emergency and a trip out to an
 outlying farm to produce a calf out of
 a cow. The phone rang again while I   
 was at the farm and I had to proceed  
 to another farm where I had to treat a
 lame cow. I picked out a nail from her
 foot and injected her with anti_biotic
 to prevent further infection.         
 At 5.30p.m. another pet surgery       
 lasting until 6.30. I was "on call"   
 for emergencies in the evening,       
 fortunately only one, at 10 p.m. a    
 whippet with a sore throat. A quick   
 read of the "Vetinary Record" and off 
 to bed.                               </content>
