		<title>04WOMERSLEY VILLAGE HALL.</title>
		<content> Womersley Hall stands immediately     
 adjacent to Saint Martins church and  
 at first sight appears to be an 18th  
 century building. The central block   
 however is a much older structure,    
 and traces of mullianed windows of the
 Tudor era are still to be seen in the 
 basement, and the side of the stable  
 entrance which may originally have    
 been the gate tower of the ancient    
 hall. Now it is no longer being used  
 by anybody and it is slowly falling   
 apart .However, the gardens are still 
 used by the craft centre at Womersley 
 for growing herbs and flowers which   
 are dried out to make decorative      
 basketware and herbal remedies. The   
 hall itself, and the things grown     
 there,and used for the Craft          
 Centre,will be of interest to visitors
 to the village.
