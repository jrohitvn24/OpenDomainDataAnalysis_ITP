		<title>06SHERE CHURCH 1</title>
		<content>   There has been a church on the      
 present site since Saxon times and    
 this was recorded in the Domesday     
 Book. The church as it stands today   
 was built in the 12th century and was 
 dedicated to St.James,patron saint of 
 pilgrims,who used to stop at Shere on 
 their way to Canterbury.              
   The church has a bell tower with a  
 ring of eight bells and a 13th century
 timber frame spire which is considered
 to be one of the first in England. The
 organ and choir stalls were originally
 sited in the chancel and were moved to
 the south aisle in 1967.              
   There are several monumental brasses
 in the floor and walls of the church. 
 These include a 15th century brass of 
 Robert Scarlif,a former rector of     
 Shere.                                
   The font is about seven hundred     
 years old,it is made of Purbeck marble</content>
