 LOCAL HISTORY                         
 Alf is an old man who went to         
 Bentworth School.He liked to play     
 football also he played cricket and   
 rounders.For playtime he had 15       
 minutes and he thinks he was set      
 all the same work as we would be      
 set now also he thinks he ate the     
 same food.Stick over the behind was   
 the main punishment he got punished   
 for being cheeky to the teachers.     
 His favourite subject was English.    
 The School has changed a lot since    
 Alf was there because there was a big 
 stove in the classroom.There were no  
 real loo's and there were only two    
 classrooms.
