		<title>18A RAMPTON VILLAGE FAMILY</title>
		<content> Hello! My name is Jaya Naghen and I go
 to Rampton Primary School. I live on  
 the Pastures Estate in Rampton        
 Village. It is an estate of modern    
 houses and bungalows which was bought 
 off the builders by Rampton Hospital  
 for their employees. We are lucky to  
 own our house. My Dad works at Rampton
 Hospital as a Tutor Nurse. He comes   
 from a country near Africa called     
 Mauritius. I have been there once but 
 it was when I was a baby.My Mum goes  
 to work and she is a teacher at an    
 Adult Training Centre for the mentally
 handicapped in Worksop. We own two    
 cars and a caravan which we use to go 
 on holiday in.I have one sister who   
 goes to the secondary school in       
 Retford, and a brother who is younger 
 than me and goes to Rampton School.   
                                       
                                       </content>
