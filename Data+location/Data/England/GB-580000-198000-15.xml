		<title>15Housing in New Town S.W.F.</title>
		<content>    South Woodham Ferrers is a town    
 full of diverse accents, as people    
 pour into the town from many different
 places, even as far away as Scotland, 
 Ireland and Switzerland. They have    
 left their families and friends behind
 to seek a new life in a new area.     
    85% of the people we questioned    
 have lived in South Woodham Ferrers   
 for less than 5 years and 40% less    
 than 2 years.                         
    75% of the properties these people 
 own are detached and 60% are less than
 5 years old. The houses, although     
 attractive and large, are built very  
 closely together and most have small  
 gardens. Nevertheless many families   
 enjoy gardening.                      
    The varied style of the houses and 
 the tidy gardens give the town a      
 special charm.
