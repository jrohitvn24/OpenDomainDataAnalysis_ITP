		<title>07NEW BUILDINGS IN EDGEFIELD</title>
		<content>                                       
 There is building in progress to      
 renovate and convert some of the older
 buildings such as Potters Farm, and   
 to modernise cottages. In-filling of  
 modern housing has been allowed in    
 Rectory Road, and there are bungalows 
 on the edge of the village. The local 
 planning committee controls all plans 
 for new building: there is at present 
 controversy about plans for new houses
 between the Green and Rectory Road.   
 There is also an estate of sixteen    
 council houses on Rectory Road: these 
 were provided to a high standard by   
 Norfolk County Council in 1914, each  
 household having half an acre of land 
 so that they could grow vegetables.   
 An unusual home until recently has    
 been the old railway carriage in a    
 field near Valley Farm, but this is no
 longer occupied.                      </content>
