		<content> The rural nature of the area makes it 
 a very popular venue for country      
 walks along nature trails and Forestry
 Commission pathways,{fishing}along    
 the River Fowey and {shooting}on the  
 fringe of the moorland.               
 More organised team activities are    
 also catered for. In the grounds of   
 the Lanhydrock Estate there is a      
 beautiful {cricket} ground, where the 
 game has been played for over one     
 hundred years. A short distance away, 
 Bodmin {Rugby} Club have utilised a   
 flat area of land, levelled off during
 the building of the Bodmin Bypass in  
 1976, to provide playing and social   
 areas for their teams.
