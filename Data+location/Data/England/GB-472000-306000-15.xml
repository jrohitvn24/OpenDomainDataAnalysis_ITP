		<title>15SHOPPING IN NE LEICS</title>
		<content> Due to the lack of regular public     
 transport and the isolated position of
 many houses all adults drive a motor  
 car and most families own at least one
 vehicle.                              
  Banking, shopping and livestock      
 markets are found at Melton Mowbray,  
 Leicester and Oakham. Food shopping is
 done at large supermarkets in Melton  
 or Leicester on a weekly or monthly   
 basis and small general stores and    
 post offices at Twyford, Tilton and   
 Burrough on the Hill are used.  Milk  
 is delivered and mobile shops call at 
 intervals.                            
  The B6047 road from Melton Mowbray to
 Market Harborough carries the bulk of 
 traffic passing through the area with 
 many heavy goods vehicles supplying   
 goods to the farms and transporting   
 livestock and produce. A weekly bus   
 service to Leicester serves the area. </content>
