		<title>11Medstead Abbey</title>
		<content>      Medstead Abbey was built in 1908 
 from flint and brick. It was extended 
 in 1956 and 1985. The abbey owns 80   
 acres of land, which is rented to     
 local farmers. 4.5 acres of land are  
 retained for the Abbey to use.        
                                       
      The Abbey is run by the Order of 
 St. Benedict, and is a Church of      
 England Order. The brothers are called
 black monks because they wear black   
 habits. The habits are in two pieces -
 the tunic is called a scapula and     
 there is also a hood.                 
                                       
      The abbey makes communion wafers 
 and incense. There are 11 brothers,   
 and they look after 14 retired people,
 mostly sailors.
