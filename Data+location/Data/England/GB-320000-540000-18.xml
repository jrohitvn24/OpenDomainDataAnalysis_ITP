		<title>18Schools'Trip to France.</title>
		<content> We arrived in Trouville at 15.00 hours
 The hotel was called Hotel Chatham and
 was run by an English couple.Lesa,    
 Kerry and me shared a room,it was     
 number 27 on the second floor. When we
 went into our room,Lesa and I unpacked
 our cases,but Kerry just left her     
 clothes in her case. We got changed   
 and went out to shop and walk along   
 the beach. We had our supper in the   
 hotel at 20.00 hours and the french   
 food was very nice. We all liked the  
 breakfasts of french bread,butter,jam 
 and hot chocolate to drink. There was 
 a swimming pool near the hotel which  
 we went to several times.Each day we  
 went out on a trip.These are some of  
 the places we visited;Bayeux,Rouen,   
 Arromanche and Horfleur. On the last  
 night there was a disco arranged for  
 us,which was great and finished about 
 23.00 hours.I hope I can go again.    </content>
