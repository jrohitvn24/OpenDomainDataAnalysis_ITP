		<content> In this area there are four community 
 schools.After 6pm. and at weekends    
 and holidays the community take over  
 the facilities of the school. A       
 community director and deputies form  
 the management structure. Activities  
 include evening classes from arts and 
 beekeeping to Victorian dolls and     
 yoga. Holidays are helped along by    
 play groups for children of all ages. 
 Weddings and other celebrations are   
 catered for. Most have integral bars  
 for a drink after the various         
 activities. Old people are  catered   
 for with social afternoons and old    
 time dancing. The schools are also    
 becoming focal points for some social 
 needs, hair dressing for the          
 housebound, gardening and activities  
 for mentally handicapped adults.      
 Average attendances are around 3000 to
 4000 per week.                        </content>
