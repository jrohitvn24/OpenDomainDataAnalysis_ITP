		<content> All the farms in the area keep some   
 beef cattle, often in the form of     
 suckler calves which run with their   
 mothers on farms where the cows are   
 not kept for milk.From the end of     
 October they are mainly taken indoors 
 for the Winter and fed on hay, silage 
 and corn until the warmer weather of  
 Spring gets the grass growing again.  
 Increasingly, the faster fattening    
 breeds such as Charolais and          
 Limousin are being kept and they      
 cannot take the cold weather.Even if  
 his cattle stay out, the farmer still 
 has to feed them in the fields as     
 there is not enough grass growth to   
 fatten them.
