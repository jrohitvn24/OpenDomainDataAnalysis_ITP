		<content>      A{flower festival}is held every 3
 yrs. in Ringland and the{village fete}
 takes place beside the churchyard     
 every 2 yrs.                          
     {Mrs.Gatton,}our school secretary,
 goes to the{Taverham Players}every wk.
 to rehearse their current play. There 
 are 42 members at present. She says   
 being in a pantomime is very nerve    
 racking and tiring but enjoyable and  
 exciting. They produce 2 plays per yr.
 &amp; each member gets the chance to play 
 major &amp; minor roles or even produce a 
 play. She says it is not hard for her 
 to learn her part, but a sort of      
 relaxation &amp; a way of meeting friends.
      There is an annual{summer fete}in
 Taverham as well as monthly{jumble    
{sales, coffee mornings, W.I. &amp; Wives  
{meetings &amp; carol singing}at Xmas. A{  
{brass band}&amp; a{group of singers}meet. 
 It is a thriving, active community.   </content>
