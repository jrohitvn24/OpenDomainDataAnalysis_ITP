 school at 9.15 and finish at 3.05 with
 45 minutes for lunch. On Thursdays the
 violin teacher comes. These are the   
 other teachers. Full time the Head

 and the infant class teacher. Part    
 time one teacher for a day, a teacher 
 for remedial work, half a day and a   
 teacher for the deaf, an hour a week. 
 Also a cook,a cleaner and a clerical  
 assistant. There are 30 children. In  
 the mornings we do maths, science,    
 writing and reading. In the afternoons
 we do P.E., play games like netball,  
 football and unihoc, paint, draw, use 
 the computer and learn geography and  
 history. Sometimes we visit other     
 schools or go on outings to places of 
 interests like the Severn Valley      
 Railway.
