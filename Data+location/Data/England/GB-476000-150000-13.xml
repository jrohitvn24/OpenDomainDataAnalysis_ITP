		<title>13BASINGSTOKE CANAL BRIDGES</title>
		<content> There are 9 bridges over the canal in 
 the Dogmersfield and Crookham Village 
 area. Two are swing bridges,four are  
 on footpaths (Sandy Hill,Sprat's      
 Hatch,Blacksmith's,Coxmoor) and three 
 carry minor roads across the canal    
 (Double,Chequers,Poulter's). Most of  
 the bridges have been restored during 
 restoration of the canal. On the      
 towpath side of the canal west of     
 Blacksmith's Bridge is a 600yard      
 stretch known as 'Great Gabion Wall', 
 which was built as a retaining wall to
 stabilise a cutting during restoration
 of the canal.It comprises wire baskets
 filled with 1500 tons of Oxfordshire  
 stone and cost Â£80,000 to build. Also 
 visible along the canal between       
 Crookham and Dogmersfield are pill-   
 boxes,concrete tank-traps and concrete
 footings, remnants of defences erected
 during the Second World War.          </content>
