 This block is divided into two        
 distinct parts.  To the west is the   
 meandering Irwell valley following the
 line of an important geological fault.
 Along the north south axis of this    
 valley it was possible to mine coal.  
 Today all that remains of this coal   
 industry is the Agecroft Mine, one of 
 the largest mines left in the         
 Lancashire Coalfield. It is a modern  
 pit with most of the coal being used
