{   RECREATION IN BOX PARISH. .        
{                                      
{ }The village of{Box}is fortunate in  
 having an enthusiastic group in the   
{Archaeological and Natural History    
{Society}who pursue the walking of as  
 many foothpaths as possible. Not only 
 does this group walk the footpaths    
 but it also keeps the council         
 informed of those that have been      
 blocked by fencing. In tne{Beech woods
 of{Quarry Hill}the footpaths have been
 churned up by motorbikes. It is       
 therefore important that the network  
 of public rights of way be maintained 
 and preserved for future generations. 
 Many paths have been waymarked along  
 their routes although some land owners
 do not like this practice and promptly
 remove them.                          
                                       </content>
