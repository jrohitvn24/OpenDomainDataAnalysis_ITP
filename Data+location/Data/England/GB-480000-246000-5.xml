I live in between Hanslope and         
Castlethorpe and I like to go          
shooting,fishing,biking,swimming and   
climbing. When I go shooting I usually 
go by the railway track. Sometimes I   
get a shot at a rat and I usually miss.
I use a 'B.S.A Mark 1 Airsporter' with 
open sights. When I go fishing I go    
down to Castlethorpe river with my     
'Fishman' 9ft rod. I usually get a few 
Perch. I am hoping for a telescopic rod
soon. When I go cycling I either go on 
my own track or I go up Long Street and
have a few goes over the sort of corse 
there. When I go swimming I usually go 
to Stantonbury or Wolverton pool. When 
I go climbing I usually go up a tree   
and abseil down. I have not yet tackled
a very steep rockface.
