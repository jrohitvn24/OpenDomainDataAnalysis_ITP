		<title>13Shopping.</title>
		<content> As there is only one small shop in the
 area most people shop in the nearby   
 towns.A survey was taken to find      
 out shopping habits. Eighty people    
 responded to the following question:- 
  "In which town do you usually do     
 your household shopping?"             
                                       
  3 people shop regularly in Stratford.
  7 people shop regularly in Warwick.  
 67 people shop regularly in Leamington
  3 show wherever they happen to be.   
  This was not surprise as the popular 
 supermarkets are in Leamington Spa.   
 Sainsbury's and Asda have large stores
 with easy car parking in the town. All
 the people in the survey travel by car
 to do their shopping.                 
  Startford upon Avon has problems with
 tourist traffic throughout the year.  
  Warwick does not have a large store  
 and parking is limited.               </content>
