		<title>02St.Nicholas', Shepperton.</title>
		<content> The church of St.Nicholas was built in
 1614, constructed of previously used  
 materials. The oblong brick tower was 
 built in 1710. The church's seats are 
 called box pews. A previous Rector of 
 Shepperton was the famous poet Thomas 
 Love Peacock.                         
 There are six bells in the church. The
 first bell was taken down in 1877 and 
 five new bells were installed and 60  
 years later the bells were retuned.   
 The present church is 317 years old.  
 The old church was situated at the    
 site of the present river. It was     
 destroyed during a flood.
