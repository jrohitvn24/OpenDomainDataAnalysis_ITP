		<title>03HONEY LANE HOSPITAL CLOSURE.</title>
		<content> The government proposes to close the  
 Honey Lane hospital.                  
Many elderly and retired people live in
the area who need medical care         
frequently                             
Typical viewpoint to local press letter
reads-"I also am appalled by the apathy
of people towards the destruction of   
our NHS.In spite of an  ever growing   
population Waltham Abbey has already   
lost its Memorial Hosp.Honey La.is next
on the hit list,and whats to become of 
St.Margarets?We are told in the        
consultation document that this hosp.is
old and isolated when it is on the edge
of a large housing estate.I am convince
that this govt.policy is to totally    
destoy our NHS                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
