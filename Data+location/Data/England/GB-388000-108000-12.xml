		<content> Mr D.W.Taylor,M.B.E.told us his family
 have lived in the area for over a     
 hundred years.Originally it was a     
 sheep farm but after the last war it  
 was the biggest pig farm in Europe.   
 Taymix,short for Taylor's Mix,came    
 about after Mr Taylor had experimented
 with a special mixture of food for    
 pigs in this area.His friends in other
 areas wanted him to do similar        
 experiments for them.Mr Taylor now has
 two dairy herds with over a hundred   
 cows,each herd controlled by one man. 
 He also has 250 calves.He grows kaile,
 wheat,barley and grass.His transport  
 business of about 40 lorries was      
 started to carry pig food but now     
 carries molasses and milk products and
 travels from Cornwall to Norfolk.
