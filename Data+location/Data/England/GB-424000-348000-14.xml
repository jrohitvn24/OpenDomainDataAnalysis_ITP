 a{football}pitch with the cows. James 
 and Ben Slack, Dominic and Ben Horton 
 go to{cricket}lessons on Friday       
 evenings at{Darley Dale.}With cubs we 
 play{rounders, football, cricket and  
{crab football,}it is good fun. Our    
 primary school has a{football}team.   
 The girls play {skittleball}but there 
 are too few for a team at school.     
  There are sports facilities at       
{Ashbourne, Belper Matlock, Derby,     
{Callow Park}and a learner pool at     
{Wirksworth.}Many people enjoy jogging.

 to the{swimming}baths. Four families  
 go to{Callow Park.}Two families go to 
{Derby.}One goes to{Matlock}and three
