		<content>             POPULATION.               
 Cranfields population has grown from a
 few hundred people to  a few  thousand
 people. The number now is  over 4,000.
             LOCAL EVENTS.             
 There were many important local events
 such  as  the  annual  show  day   and
 "Cranfield Feast Day".  Both  of these
 have  gone  out  of  existance now.The
 show day was  held  in the field oppo-
 site the Baptist Church. On this day a
 band  would  come. This day was around
 the middle of July.                   
            WOODLANDS AND WILDLIFE.    
 The  woodlands  around  Cranfield have
 decreased  greatly.  There  have  been
 paths  worn  through  the  fields  and
 woods  but  most of  these  have  been
 ploughed over. There is quite a lot of
 wildlife  around   Cranfield  such  as
 deer, rabbits, geese, ducks, hares and
 jays.                                 </content>
