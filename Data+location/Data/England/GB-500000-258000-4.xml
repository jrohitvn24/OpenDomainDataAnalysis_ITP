		<title>04Gravel Extraction.</title>
		<content> Gravel extraction is a major landscape
 influence in the section of the Ouse  
 Valley on the western edge of the     
 survey area.River terrace sand and    
 gravel deposits of high quality are   
 extracted for use in the road and     
 house construction industry.          
 The environmental impact of these     
 quarries varies with the nature of the
 individual workings.At the present    
 they are screened quite effectivly by 
 trees and being "wet" will eventually 
 flood.                                
 This means that when digging out is   
 complete restoration will involve the 
 production of a number of lagoons.    
 These could be made avalible for      
 leisure activities-fishing,water      
 sports,birdwatching-and has happened  
 in other parts of the county.         
 Recent plans to extend these workings 
 towards the village of Sharnbrook.    </content>
