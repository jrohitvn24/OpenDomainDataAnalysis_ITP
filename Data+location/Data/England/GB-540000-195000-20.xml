		<content>  Loughton does not have many legends. 
 There is one about Dick Turpin and one
 about Boudicea. They say that the     
 ghost of{Dick Turpin}still rides up   
 York Hill or Pump Hill.{Boudicea}was  
 queen of the Ancient Britons and it is
 said that she hid from the Romans at  
 Loughton Camp.                        
  On Thursday the shops are closed for 
 half a day. The customs in Loughton   
 are few, but one that is becoming     
 established is{Loughton Day}when      
 people have fun around the town. On   
 Remembrance Day we remember people    
 from the wars. Loughton has lots of   
{fetes}organised by the scouts, guides 
 and churches. The churches also have  
 flower festivals. In the forest there 
 are cold spots where people don't go  
 because it sends a shiver down their  
 spines.                               
                                       </content>
