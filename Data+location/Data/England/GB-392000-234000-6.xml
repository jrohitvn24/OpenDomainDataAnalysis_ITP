		<content> The families in our area  are  quite  
 well off. The children spend most of  
 their time at{school.}The dads go to  
{work}and the mums stay at home doing  
 the{housework}although many mums go   
 to work as well. Most families spend  
 their weekends together. They{shop    
 and do  various things like going to  
 the{Swimming Pool,}sitting in the     
 garden on a hot summers day and going 
 to different places. On Sundays lots  
 of people go to{church.}In winter  it 
 quite often snows. Children go out and
 play in it. They play on sledges and  
 throw balls of snow at each other. In 
 the evenings families have tea        
 together and talk about their day's   
 work. Sometimes families join up tog- 
 ether and go for picnics or for a walk
  When it is someones'{birthday}you    
 give them a present to show your love 
 for them.                             </content>
