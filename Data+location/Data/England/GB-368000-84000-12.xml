		<title>12EMPLOYMENT IN UPWEY (2)</title>
		<content> A.E.MILLS BUILDERS ALSO HAD 2 WORKERS 
 WHO LIVED IN WEYMOUTH,AND THE WISHING 
 WELL SHOP HAD 6 WORKERS WHO LIVED IN  
 WEYMOUTH.                             
 ALL THE 8 PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT WERE   
 CONTACTED,BUT INFORMATION WAS         
 UNOBTAINABLE AT SOME.                 
 FROM THIS SURVEY WE CAN SEE THAT THERE
 ARE VERY FEW PLACES OF                
 EMPLOYMENT.THOSE THAT THERE ARE EMPLOY
 ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE.THIS    
 PERHAPS SHOWS THAT UPWEY IS REALLY A  
 SUBURB (ALTHOUGH RURAL) OF WEYMOUTH.  
 THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE LIVING IN UPWEY
 WORK IN AREAS OUTSIDE THE ACTUAL      
 VILLAGE.THIS IS UNDERSTANDABLE        
 CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF PLACES OF   
 WORK.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
