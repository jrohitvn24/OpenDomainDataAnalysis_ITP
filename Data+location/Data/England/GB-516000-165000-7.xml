         {Berrylands area              
  People who have lived the shortest   
 time want to move because the houses  
 are rented.Two out of six people we   
 asked were born in this area.The four 
 people that were not born in this area
 were brought here because of the war  
 and work and one of houses had        
 tenants.Most people expect to stay for
 years to come.The houses were semi    
 detached and they look about 30 to 40 
 years old.
