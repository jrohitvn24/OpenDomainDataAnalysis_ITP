		<title>02THE HISTORY OF KIRKBY</title>
		<content> Kirkby-The settlement by the church   
 was mentioned in the Domesday book in 
 1086 as Cherchebi. Then it had a      
 population of 70.                     
  It is a mixture of the urban and the 
 rural, the new and the old.           
 The new town of Kirkby was started in 
 1952 as an overspill area of          
 Liverpool. The town had problems from 
 the outset-houses were completed      
 before schools and shops and as many  
 wage-earners still worked in          
 Liverpool, and the public transport   
 system was ineffective, getting to    
 work became a mammoth operation. In   
 recent years Kirkby has stabilised and
 became more established, it is less   
 Sunday supplement material than it    
 once was but unemployment is soaring  
 &amp; the industrial estate declining.{
