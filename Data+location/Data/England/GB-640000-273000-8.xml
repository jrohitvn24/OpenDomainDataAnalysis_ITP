Since 1900 the population has continued
to decline but since 1970 has          
stabilised at about its present total  
of 550, but with less than 5% of the   
occupations being concerned with the   
land.                                  
During the 1914-18 War 22 local men    
were killed. The 1939-45 War saw 5 more
killed. On the 2nd September 1943, a   
local man, Company Sergeant Major Peter
Wright, was awarded the Victoria Cross 
at Salerno.
