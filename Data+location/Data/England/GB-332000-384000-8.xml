		<content> The impression of the area is that    
 land cover consists of{suburban       
{estates}and{'tended land',}much of it 
 is playing fields and{recreation      
{grounds.} Two main roads, Old Chester 
 Rd and Kings Rd, run roughly from     
 South-East to North-West and have     
 various clusters of shops beside them 
 at important road junctions.  The     
 recreation grounds are a notable      
 feature, but only one, the{Oval,}is   
 really significant.  Its 1920's plan  
 and buildings led it to be featured in
 the recent successful{film "Chariots  
{of Fire."} It is of significance to   
 the whole{Wirral area,}not simply to  
 the immediate locality, and its race  
 track and indoor swimming pool are    
 facilities frequently used by local   
 schools.
