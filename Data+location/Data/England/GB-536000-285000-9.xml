		<content>     Out of a total population of 6180,
 1515 are aged 60 and over. Of these   
 655 are males, 860 are females.       
   {Lyons Court}is warden controlled   
 accomodation consisting of flats and  
 bungalows. It is run by{Fenland       
{District Council.}There are 38 people 
 here at present, 17 of whom were      
 originally here when the home opened  
 in 1972. There are 13 males and 28    
 females in the age range 68 to 90.    
 They go into the flats/bungalows      
 because they are smaller and easier to
 look after, not because of ill health.
 There is a long waiting list.         
    Facilities include a laundry room  
 with a drier; communal kitchen,       
 lounge/reading room, guestroom and pay
 telephones. The{warden}has her own    
 accomodation within the home. Outside 
 are areas of grass and flowers.       
 Residents help maintain the grounds.  </content>
