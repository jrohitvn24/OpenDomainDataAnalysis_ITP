     The services are about an hour    
 and some about an hour and a half.    
     The church has a magazine         
 called"The Foursome"because it is the 
 magazine for the four churches in the 
 Whittington and Andoversford area.He  
 conducts two or more marriages a      
 year,for there are more older people  
 than younger.He conducts more funerals
 than marriages because the older are  
 dieing.                               
     During the week he does do        
 activities for the children but only  
 Brownies,Cubs and Scouts.             
     The church originally came from   
 The BlackMountains in Wales in the    
 twelth century.Later it was transfered
 down to Gloucestershire.Then the      
 monastries were used for schools.In   
 1540 the mmonastries dissolved and    
 ever since there has been a vicar.    </content>
