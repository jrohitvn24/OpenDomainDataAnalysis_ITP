		<title>14THE LANCASTER CANAL-AN ASSET</title>
		<content>  The canal has a lot to offer to the  
city of Lancaster, it is a pleasant    
place to walk, a stretch of green grass
and water close to the city centre.    
  In some areas new houses built near  
the canal have taken advantage of this 
with places to sit near the water, but 
some of the older houses turn their    
backs on it, with high walls blocking  
off the canal.                         
  But not everybody appreciates the    
canal,some scribble graffiti on bridges
and drop litter on the towpath.        
  In winter the canal can freeze over  
and many people have the pleasure of   
skating and sliding on the ice, but    
others turn it into a minefield with   
stones and other missiles thrown onto  
the ice.                               
  Hopefully in the years to come more  
people will realise that the Lancaster 
Canal is a great asset to the city.    </content>
