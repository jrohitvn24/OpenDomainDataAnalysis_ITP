		<title>14Chilton Pigeon Club.</title>
		<content>   The members of Chilton Pigeon Club  
 have their own small clubhouse near to
 the main road.                        
   When the pigeons are young a hard   
 plastic ring is put on one of their   
 legs. The ring tells where it comes   
 from and who is the owner. eg.        
   {NEHU} North East Homing Union      
   {79DC} 1979   Durham Combine        
   The pigeons race every Saturday from
 different race points from 50 to 100  
 miles away. They are trained once or  
 twice each week from 30 to 50 miles.  
   The birds are kept in lofts. Many   
 lofts are on the allotments.          
   Pigeon race times are measured in   
 yards per minute. On the Friday the   
 clocks are sruck (started up) and when
 the bird arrives at its loft a rubber 
 ring is carefully removed from its leg
 placed in a thimble and timed in a    
 printing clock.                       </content>
