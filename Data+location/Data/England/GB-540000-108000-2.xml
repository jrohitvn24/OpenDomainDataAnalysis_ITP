		<title>02    HISTORIC  LEWES</title>
		<content>{"Fine old buildings".}This is many    
 people's first impression of Lewes.   
 Careful conservation has preserved a  
 rich variety of styles to the present 
 day. The 11th century{castle}keep,    
 built by a grateful follower of       
 William 1, dominates the town from the
 top of its chalk block mound. A huge  
 Cluniac{Priory}was ravaged by stone-  
 stealers,Victorian railway builders   
 and the weather,and largely neglected 
 until recently. Its fine Caen lime-   
 stone now adorns many buildings in    
 Southover,notably{Anne of Cleves House
 and{Southover Grange,}an Elizabethan  
 manor house,now marriage registry,    
 public rooms and a pottery,with       
 beautifully-kept public gardens.      
      Queen Anne and Georgian houses   
 form many High Street frontages,with  
 frequent use of{knapped flint}or{math-
{ematical tiles.Narrow twittens abound.</content>
