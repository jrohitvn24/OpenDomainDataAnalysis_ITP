		<content>     Most of the hedges in the area    
 have two varieties of trees in them   
 indicating an age of 100-150 years.   
 Originally they were used to          
 separate fields of mainly sheep, but  
 now very few farms keep any           
 live-stock.                           
     There is a tradition of large     
 fields in the area, one of them having
 been known as 200 Acre Field for many 
 years.  However, with the growth of   
 arable farming, many hedges have been 
 removed.  One field examined in the   
 survey was about 1.5km. long and 1km. 
 wide.                                 
     Along roadside hedges and verges a
 good number of trees have been planted
 to replace the mane elms lost through 
 dutch-elm disease.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
