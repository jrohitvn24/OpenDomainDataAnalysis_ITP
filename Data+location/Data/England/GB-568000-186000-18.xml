		<content> WHEN BASILDON WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED, 
 IT WA DIVIDED UP INTO NEIGHBOURHOODS  
 AND EACH ONE HAD A PRIMARY SCHOOL, AND
 A SECONDARY SCHOOL. AS THER TOWN GREW 
 THEY SCHOOLS WERE BURSTING AT THE     
 SEEMS. MOST OF THEM HAD EXTRA WOODEN  
 CLASSROOMS PUT IN THE PLAYGROUND. OUR 
 SCHOOL HAD TEN CLASSROOMS INTO THE    
 ORGINAL BRICK BUILDING, BUT WHEN WE   
 WERE AT AT BIGGEST, WE HAD  SEVEN     
 EXTRA WOODEN CLASSROOMS ALL AROUND THE
 PLACE. WE ARE NOW HALF THAT SIZE AND  
 ONLY HAVE EIGHT CLASSES. MANY OF THE  
 SCHOOLS ARE CLOSING AS THERE ARE NOT  
 ENOUGH PUPILS. SOME INFANT AND JUNIOR 
 SCHOLS ARE COMBINING TO MAKE ONE      
 PROMARY SCHOOL, AND THE EMPTY BUILDING
 IS BEING USED FOR SOMETHING ELSE, LIKE
 THE EDUCATION OFFICE, OLD PEOPLES DAY 
 CENTRE, AND A SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN WHO 
 ARE DISRUPTIVE.
