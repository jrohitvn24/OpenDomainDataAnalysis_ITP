		<title>10BRIERLEY HILL FLATS</title>
		<content>    These tower blocks and maisonettes 
 dominate the skyline of{Brierley Hill.
 They vary in size but not style.      
 Constructed in the early 1960's when  
 buildings of this type were popular   
 amongst town planners,they've suffered
 several naturally recognised problems 
 in terms of the physical structure of 
 the building,and the associated social
 difficulties encountered by residents 
 of such housing, namely vandalism,    
 isolation and a large proportion of   
 elderly and unemployed residents.     
    They cover an area of 12,000 sq.m. 
 including paths,roads,lawns,ramps and 
 steps.There are 789 individual housing
 units in groups of 8-60. Built as they
 are along the crest of a ridge which  
 itself rises from 140-150m.,the       
 tallest block rises to about 180m. and
 can be seen from Malvern, some 80km to
 the south west.                       </content>
