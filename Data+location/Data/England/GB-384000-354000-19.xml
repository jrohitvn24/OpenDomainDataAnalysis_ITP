		<content>      Two policemen P.C.Nixon and      
P.C.Holdcroft came to school. They     
told us about Kidsgrove police         
station. They have 2 men in the cells  
at the moment, the highest number they 
can have is 6. The new station is      
about 10 years old, the old station    
was built over 100 years ago.          
      They told us that police could   
not use weapons without permission.    
Only one group from over 40 offices at 
kidsgrove is trained to use them. The  
police have one IRV car,one van, 4     
cars and 2 4 wheel drive Range Rovers. 
      They have one dog, the handler is
named P.C.Finney.The police have       
arrested about 600 people this year.   
Their area goes from Scholar Green to  
Goldenhill and Mow Cop to Talke.
