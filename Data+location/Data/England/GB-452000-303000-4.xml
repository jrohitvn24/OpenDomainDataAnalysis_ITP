		<title>04MY DAY BY ANDREW BLOW AGE 7</title>
		<content> I usually wake upat 7am.Then I play a 
 game with my brother David.Mummy tells
 us to get dressed and we go down for  
 our breakfast,which usually consists  
 of toast,fruit juice and cereal.      
 Daddy leaves for work and we then set 
 of for my school at 8.30am.           
 When I arrive at school I go straight 
 into my classroom to wait for my      
 teacher to arrive.She calls the       
 register and then gives us some       
 writing or sums to do until           
 lunchtime.At lunchtime I eat my       
 sandwiches in the dining room before  
 going out onto the fields to play     
 football with my friends.In the       
 afternoon we put on our plimsoles to  
 do activities .Mummy comes to collect 
 me at 3.30pm to go home.When I get    
 home I play on my BMX bike for a while
 ,have tea and watch TV.It is then time
 for my bath,a story and off to bed.   </content>
