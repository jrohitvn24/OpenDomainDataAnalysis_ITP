 development of houses and people have 
 came into the village from many parts 
 of the country.There are now,because  
 of this,many {dialects} ranging from  
 the original {Devon} used by the older
 local people,to Scottish spoke by some
 people.There are still some people who
 speak real {Devon.}The words are      
 changing.People use the old dialects  
 less now because they all listen to   
 radio or television and use those     
 forms of speech.Here are some {local
