		<content> A BLACKSMITH                          
                                       
 My Dad is a blacksmith. Nowadays he   
 makes gates, stakes, large staples,   
 weather vanes for churches, railings, 
 fire escapes, lightning conductors and
 lots more. Before the war they had    
 many rollers and traction engines all 
 worked by steam.  After the war the   
 owner was wanting someone to help him 
 but everyone was finding the work too 
 hard. But my Dad said he would do it  
 and has now been there nearly 40 years
 and finds it interesting and fun. In  
 the l830s about thirty coaches a day  
 came through Petersfield. Many of them
 stopped to change horses. The main    
 work at the forge was shoeing horses  
 and making the metal parts for        
 carriages.  Nowadays there is very    
 little of this kind of work.
