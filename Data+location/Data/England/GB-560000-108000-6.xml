		<title>06Draining Horse-Eye Marshland</title>
		<content> The ecology of the Horse-Eye Levels   
 has been greatly altered in the latter
 part of the 20th century. The Levels  
 are privately owned Freehold and      
 worked by owner farmers or tenant     
 farmers. Drainage is the              
 responsibility of Southern Water      
 Authority who are paid from Water     
 Rates &amp; by resident farmers who pay   
 extra for any more local &amp; immediate  
 advantage obtained. Previous high     
 water level restricted use of the land
 to grassland. Controlled drainage via 
 use of a pumping station &amp; the dykes  
 has reduced the water level, so that  
 some areas can be ploughed and used   
 for crops.
