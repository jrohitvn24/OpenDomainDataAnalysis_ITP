		<content> ARTS AND CRAFTS CONTINUE TO SURVIVE IN
 THIS AREA - PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE   
 INFLUENCE OF THE LOCAL WOMENS         
 INSTITUTE, AS MANY COUNTRY WOMEN ARE  
 MEMBERS.                              
 IN ADDITION TO THE LADIES' CULINARY   
 EXPERTISE,THEY ARE FREQUENTLY EXPERT  
 NEEDLEWOMEN IN CROCHET, DRESSMAKING,  
 KNITTING AND EMBROIDERY. THERE ARE    
 ALSO MANY LOCAL LADIES WHO ARE VERY   
 ACCOMPLISHED IN THE ART OF LACEMAKING 
 - A SLOW AND VERY DEMANDING PURSUIT   
 WHICH TAKES A HEAVY TOLL ON THE EYES  
 OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.                
 POPULAR FUND-RAISERS AT LOCAL EVENTS  
 ARE THE MANY HOME-MADE ITEMS WHICH    
 FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF RURAL CRAFTS
 - AND TOWN DWELLERS ARE AMONG THE MOST
 ENTHUSIASTIC CUSTOMERS FOR THESE      
 WARES.RURAL COMMUNITIES SEEM TO       
 PRODUCE MANY QUALITY ARTISTS WHO ARE  
 INCREASINGLY APPRECIATED.             </content>
