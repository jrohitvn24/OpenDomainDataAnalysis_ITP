		<title>12The Village Shop.</title>
		<content>  Within the survey area there is one  
 shop a Post Office and General Store  
 in Moreton Morrell. John Davis, the   
 owner, talked to the children.        
  "I don't know how old the shop is. My
 wife's Grandmother had it before us   
 and she started the shop.             
  "I've been here over twenty years. I 
 don't think the Post Office has       
 changed. I don't think I shall change 
 the shop now."                        
  "I don't think the village has       
 changed, apart from a few council     
 houses".                              
  "I do enjoy my work. It takes        
 politeness and friendliness to be a   
 good shopkeeper, also quickness."     
  "We do seem busier but I don't know  
 if we have more customers...a lot do  
 criticize my Post Office but not to my
 face."                                
 Mr.&amp;Mrs. Davis also deliver the mail. </content>
