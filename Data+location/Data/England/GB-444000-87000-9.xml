		<content> There are ten buildings listed by the 
 Department of the Enviroment as being 
 of special{architectural or historical
{interest}in the survey area.Seven of  
 these are 18th. century farmhouses.   
 Swainston Manor is also listed. Across
 the road from Manor stands another    
 listed building, the Temple. It was   
 built in the 18th.century to look like
 a Greek temple and to provide a view  
 from the Manor.Two other{interesting  
{buildings}are the Bowcombe Methodist  
 Chapel and the old railway station at 
 Watchingwell.The chapel stands in open
 country and it was opened in 1908,by  
 the Mayoress of Newport.Today it still
 serves a small congregation and       
 provides a Sunday School and Youth    
 Club for the area. The old station was
 opened in 1889 as a private halt      
 serving Swainston on the Freshwater   
 line,it is now a private house.       </content>
