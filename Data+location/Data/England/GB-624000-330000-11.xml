		<content> In the area to the west of North      
 Walsham people have to travel quite   
 long distances to work.Hardly anyone  
 works on the land apart from part time
 work such as fruit picking,hoeing,etc.
 which is seasonal work-so towns are   
 where the work is.We asked everyone in
 our school where their parents go to  
 work and we found that 7 work in North
 Walsham 9 in Aylsham 2 in Bacton 3 in 
 Colby 1 in Norwich 1 in Gunton and 1  
 in Gt Yarmouth.Some parents are out of
 work.                                 
  The number of people unemployed      
 changes because of seasonal work and  
 ups and downs of industry.            
 Tourism is becoming more important as 
 other areas of jobs are uncetain and  
 many firms have to lay off people.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
