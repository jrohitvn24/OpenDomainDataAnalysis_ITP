		<title>10Entertainment in Barnburgh.</title>
		<content>   Across the road from St. Peters     
 Church is something that the village  
 people fought hard for "The Barnburgh 
 and Harlington Village Hall".The hall 
 was built in 1975 and stands on the   
 site of the old village school.The day
 to day running of the Village Hall is 
 purely a village concern, and is not  
 supported in any way by grants or     
 endowments from the local or district 
 authorities. The activities held in   
 the hall are as follows:              
 Playgroup,Mother and Toddler Group,   
 Youth Club, Over 60's, Dancing        
 Classes- ballet and tap, Keep-fit and 
 Councillor's Surgery. It also         
 accomodates a village doctor, a child 
 welfare clinic and a chiropodist. The 
 Hall can also be privately booked for 
 weddings,parties and disco's. A       
 village tote is run weekly and        
 provides a valuable source of income. </content>
