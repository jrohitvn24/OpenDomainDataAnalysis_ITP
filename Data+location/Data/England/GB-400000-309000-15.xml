		<title>15GORSEMOOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>Gorsemoor school is in Gorsemoor Road, 
Heath Hayes.  It is an infant and      
junior school.  It is a modern school  
which was opened in 1983. It is a      
different shape to any other school,   
the hall slants down.                  
In the hall there is a lot of          
apparatuslike ropes, rope ladders      
climbing frames, bars and boxes.       
The classrooms are open plan because   
they have got no doors except the doors
that lead into school.                 
In school we have 10 bases and 3       
classrooms. In each base we have a wet 
area with sinks and tiles on the floor 
where we do art.  We have a quiet room 
for doing our work silently.           
We have a television and a video so    
that we can watch programmes to do with
our work.
