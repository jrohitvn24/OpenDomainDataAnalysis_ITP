 newspaper which is distributed        
 throughout our survey area-circulation

 Lymington. It highlights matters of   
 national and particularly local       
 concern. It also advertises local     
 shops, businesses, products,events and
 endeavors.                            
  It recently put the spotlight on the 
{Gordleton Industrial Park}in Sway Rd. 
 (10 new factory units) which in June  
 1985 were not all taken. The large    
 surrounding area (old gravel pits)    
 will also be developed.               
  We visited one unit which produces a 
 new local product{New Forest Icecream.

 used and 7 flavours are produced for  
 sale in 30 local shops. With 2 full-  
 time &amp; 3 part-time staff 1000 to 2000
