		<title>07TRAFFIC: HINTON CHARTERHOUSE</title>
		<content>  AS THE PEOPLE OF HINTON CHARTERHOUSE 
 ARE MOSTLY ELDERLY, ONE OF THE MAJOR  
 CONCERNS OF THE RESIDENTS IS THE      
 AMOUNT OF{TRAFFIC}THAT TRAVELS AT     
 SPEED ALONG THE MAIN ROAD THROUGH THE 
 VILLAGE. THIS IS THE{B3110}WHICH, AS  
 WELL AS BEING THE ROUTE USED BY THE   
 VERY INFREQUENT BUS SERVICE, IS ONE OF
 THE MAIN ROADS LINKING FROME AND BATH.
 IT IS A POPULAR ROUTE WITH PRIVATE    
 CARS AND COMMERCIAL TRAFFIC ALIKE, AS 
 BY USING IT, THEY CAN AVOID A VERY    
 STEEP HILL ON THE MORE MAJOR ROAD.    
  AT PRESENT, THERE IS NO SPEED LIMIT  
 ON ANY OF THE ROADS IN THE VILLAGE,   
 ALTHOUGH THE SIDE ROADS DO HAVE WEIGHT
 RESTRICTIONS. AFTER A LONG STRUGGLE,  
 IT IS LIKELY THAT A SPEED LIMIT OF{40 
{M.P.H.}WILL SOON BE IMPOSED ON THE    
 STRETCHES OF ROAD CLOSEST TO THE      
 VILLAGE CENTRE, WHICH WILL PLEASE THE 
 CAMPAIGNERS.                          </content>
