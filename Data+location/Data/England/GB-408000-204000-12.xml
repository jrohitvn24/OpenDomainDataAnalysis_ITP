		<title>12BIBURY TROUT FARM</title>
		<content> This was founded in 1902 to raise     
 rainbow trout. Each year 250,000-     
 400,000 live fish are delivered to    
 restock waterways all over Britain.   
 The trout farm employs 12 people who  
 use a variety of machinery of which   
 the most important are pumps to keep  
 the fish healthy. The fish are fed 5  
 tons of specialised food daily ,      
 ( costing Â£450 per ton in 1985 ).     
 There are 50 ponds each containing    
 between 2000-4000 fish. The most      
 critical time is during the breeding  
 season (November-January) when the    
 small trout are more likely to die.   
 Disease can be a problem because of   
 the high stocking rates.              
 About 60,000 people visit the farm    
 each year and a new building will     
 provide an information centre and a   
 place for preparing the fish sold     
 locally and to the visitors.          </content>
