		<content>  Television is one of the main        
 entertainments in the Penistone       
 area.It is purely  meant for          
 pleasure.To some people it has become 
 a third parent,they become addicted to
 it.Some people are also influenced by 
 it.                                   
 Our survey which was carried out in   
 Oxspring showed that more people      
 watched the television in the evening 
 than in the day.Soap Opera's were the 
 most popular(these are weekly stories 
 of either families or places).        
 There are programmes which are based  
 only on the yorkshire way of life like
 Last of the Summer Wine. Which is     
 filmed only 5 miles from Penistone on 
 the edge of the Pennines. The local   
 news programmes are Calendar and Look 
 North.
