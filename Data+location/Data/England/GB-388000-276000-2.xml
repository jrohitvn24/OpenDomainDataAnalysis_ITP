{Blakedown Church Of England School}was
 built in 1885 and so is holding a     
 centenary celebration this year. There
 are two parts to the building, the    
 second year pupils work in the        
 original building and the remaining   
 children work in the 'new' block which
 is about 35 years old. There is a     
 small gymnasium where the children    
 have Physical Education. This hall is 
 also used as a dining hall. A small   
 reading library is in the main hall.  
 The children occasionally go for      
 services in the nearby church.        
 Children attend from 4 or 5 years to 9
 years old. There are three teachers   
 including the Headmaster.             
 Control is held by the Board of       
 Governors, nominated locally, who are 
 responsible to the County Education   
 Committee.                            </content>
