		<content> The job of the filter station is to   
 filter water and make sure it is fit  
 to drink. The filter station is 42    
 years old. It has eight filter tanks  
 in it and two pumps, and three soda   
 tanks to clear the water. The water   
 comes from Baystone Bank Reservoir    
 which holds 30,000,000 gallons and    
 covers 7.2 acres. It holds enough     
 water to last 47 days with no water   
 going in to it. The reservoir serves  
 houses and factories in Millom,       
 Haverigg, The Green, The Hill and     
 Silecroft, which all use 2000 cubic   
 metres per day. The caretaker who     
 looks after the station starts work at
 8am and finishes at 4.30pm. He pumps  
 the clean water from the filter       
 station to the two storage tanks at   
 Bankhouse and Lowhouse. The present   
 caretaker has been there for 23 years 
 and says he enjoys his job.           </content>
