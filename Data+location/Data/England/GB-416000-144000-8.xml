		<title>08The Range.</title>
		<content>  {The Range}is part of The Salisbury  
 Plain.The land has been owned by The  
 Army for 80 years.The farmers pay a   
 low rent for the land because of      
 military activity in the area.        
   The Range has a lot of wildlife.We  
 recorded some of the birds there were 
 Skylark,Cuckoo,Crow and Pigeon.Cattle,
 Sheep,Hares,Mice,Moles,Badgers and    
 Deers can also be found.              
   Most of the{trees}in the area were  
 not indigenous.One wood called Dumbell
 Copse contained Beech trees and Fir   
 trees.                                
   Near the woods is a place known as  
 The Dog Graves.There are seven graves 
 thought to be those of farm dogs.     
   When the Red Army Flags are flying  
 the general public can not use certain
 parts of The Range.
