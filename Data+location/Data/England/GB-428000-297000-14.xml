		<title>14MORNING OF A ROYAL VISIT</title>
		<content>The town was covered in flags and      
ribbon,I thought Atherstone was going  
to burst it was so packed with people! 
In the morning there was a lot of      
exitement and work, the cameras came   
from the Central T.V and started       
filming the main masque characters.The 
cleaners were putting the final touches
to the hall.We put our costumes on at a
quarter to eleven with thoughts rushing
through my mind ,such as "Would they be
late?"I felt really nervous before we  
went in, but as I skipped around       
hitting villeins with my pigs bladder,I
felt better.At the end of the ballad we
all stood inn our pattern and Prince   
and Princess of Wales came to speak to 
us.It seemed strange being in the same 
room as the Royal Couple.Princess Di   
asked me about the bladder ,screwed up 
her face and said"Ugh!"  SARAH EVERETT
