		<content>The History of Park Hall-The Park was  
originally a park for deer,but now it  
is a country park for the general      
public to visit.It covers 435.6 acres  
at the south east corner of Stoke-on-  
Trent.It is maintained by six rangers, 
but only a few of them are there at one
time.                                  
  They range schemes such as fun runs, 
walks and tours around the park.They   
provide an information centre which is 
always open to the general public.     
  There are many types of wildlife in  
Park hall,but not so common are the    
Dottard,long-eared owl and lesser-     
spotted woodpecker.They fly through the
park when migrating to the south.      
  There are some rare orchids around   
the lake and they bloom for two weeks a
year.Occasionally a fox or rabbit is   
found with its leg torn.If badly hurt  
it is put down,some are taken to a vet.</content>
