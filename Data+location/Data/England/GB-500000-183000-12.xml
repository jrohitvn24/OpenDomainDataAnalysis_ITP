		<content> In the playground children shout      
 The noise is very loud                
 Some children play all by themselves  
 And others play in crowds             
 There's running games and jumping too 
 Oh! there are so many                 
 There's one called Leapfrog one called
 Chase, And one called Weeping Jenney  
 There's Rounders played with bat and  
 ball, Where you run from base to base 
 And there's ons called British Bulldog
 Which we think is really ace          
 These are the games played by         
 The children in our school            
 There's many more but I can't         
 List them all                         
 We did a survey of the games          
 Played by the cildren in our class    
 Rounders won by quite a bit           
 And Runacross came last.
