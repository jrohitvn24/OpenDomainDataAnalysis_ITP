		<title>07PEATLING LODGE FARM</title>
		<content> THIS FARM HAS BEEN IN THE OWNER'S     
 FAMILY FOR AT LEAST 30 YEARS. ALL OF  
 THE FAMILY WORK ON THE FARM WHICH     
 SPECIALIZES IN FATTENING UP CATTLE AND
 SELLING THEM AT THE MARKET. THEY HAVE 
 75 COWS.                              
 THE FARM IS SPREAD OVER AN AREA OF 157
 ACRES. THE FARM IS SOLELY RUN BY      
 MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY.                
 ALTHOUGH A PUBLIC FOOTPATH RUNS       
 STRAIGHT THROUGH THE FARMLAND, OVER   
 THE PAST YEARS THERE HAS BEEN NO      
 VANDALISM TO CROPS, FENCING,ETC.      
 A NUMBER OF BEEHIVES, WHICH ARE OWNED 
 BY DR. ROWS OF COUTESTHORPE, ARE ALSO 
 ON THE FARM.                          
 WE SPOKE TO THE FARMER'S WIFE ABOUT   
 LIFE ON THE FARM. SHE SAID THAT       
 ALTHOUGH LIFE WAS VERY HARD, IT WAS   
 ALSO VERY REWARDING. SHE WOULDN'T MOVE
 TO A MORE SECURE JOB FOR ANYTHING.
