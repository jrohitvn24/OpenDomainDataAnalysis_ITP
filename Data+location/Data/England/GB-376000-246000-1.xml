		<title>01THE MALVERN LINK AREA</title>
		<content>     This area is primarily residential
 with a mixture of older Victorian     
 properties and modern estates         
 being built for the commuter          
 population. The remainder of the area 
 is made up from commercial land-use   
 and the hills themselves.             
     Tourism is playing an increasingly
 important part in the area, both with 
 the re-opening of Malvern as a spa and
 the connection between the hills and  
 the music of Edward Elgar.            
     Industry is based on small        
 factories, some catering for          
 specialist markets eg. Morgan Motors. 
 The Royal Signals Radar Establishment 
 provides a lot of local employment.   
     There is a thriving local sports  
 scene although there are relatively   
 few facilities for general public use.
