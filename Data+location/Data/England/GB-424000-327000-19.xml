		<content> Out of school our lives are full as we
 belong to lots of different clubs and 
 organisations. Many of us have        
 swimming lessons, several have music  
 lessons, and a few learn horse        
 riding. We also belong to a gymnastics
 club. We must attend regularly and    
 pass grades. When we are old enough   
 there are the cubs and brownies for us
 to join.                              
 We also enjoy activities we take part 
 in with our parents. Many of us go    
 ski-ing, sailing, water ski-ing and   
 fishing.                              
 The latest addition to our pursuits is
 the popular BMX bicycle. We can either
 belong to a club to gain experience or
 practise on our own.
