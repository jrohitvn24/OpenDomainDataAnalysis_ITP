		<title>10THE KING'S HEAD</title>
		<content>    The King's Head is in Chigwell,    
 Essex.  It is a restaurant, pub and a 
 hotel.  It has two kitchens and       
 another one which is used for         
 weddings, parties and discos.  Winston
 Churchill and Charles Dickens stayed  
 in the Kings Head, and so did Queen   
 Elizabeth 1st.                        
                                       
   The restaurant is an 85 seater, and 
 the function room holds 120 people.   
 The pub was a school and then turned  
 into a youth hostel.  The pub had     
 several names before the Kings Head.  
 It has 37 staff and about 75% enjoy   
 their job. The manager is very strict 
 on under age people and drunks.  The  
 staff consists of two cleaning ladies,
 cooks, bar attendants, waiters and    
 waitresses.
