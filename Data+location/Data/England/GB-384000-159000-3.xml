		<title>03CHURCHES IN HOLT (PART TWO)</title>
		<content> Some people wanted churches separate  
 from The Church of England so the     
 United Reform Church was built. The   
 main hall of the U.R.C. was built in  
 1813 and the Church that we know was  
 actually a main exstention  and it was
 built in 1880. The U.R.C. co-operates 
 with St. Katharine's locally but not  
 nationally. They have an infant       
 baptism and sometimes they have an    
 adult baptism.The U.R.C. Hall is used 
 for Tiny Tots, Youth Club, Guides,    
 Brownies and a Nursery School. The    
 Church is closely involved with the   
 village. It has similar services to   
 the Church of England and holds family
 services once a month. They have      
 Blessings, which are baptisms without 
 water, so that children can choose    
 whether to have a proper baptism later
 on when they become teenagers.
