		<content> The area lacks a major sports centre, 
 but there are a number of sports clubs
 and grounds. Hockey and rugby are 2 of
 the most popular games. In summer they
 are replaced with cricket and tennis. 
 The 2 man_made lakes in the River     
 Roding valley provide good facilities 
 for  windsurfing , which is becoming  
 more popular. Epping Forest is also   
 popular with sportsmen. Horse riding  
 is very common, either from a number  
 of riding schools or from private     
 yards. Riders do cause problems,      
 however, by cutting up the ground and 
 making it muddy in places. The Forest 
 is also popular with walkers, joggers 
 and naturalists.                      
 Other sports which are played in this 
 area include  bowls, football and     
 lacrosse.
