		<content> The Catholic Church was built in      
 1953,and seats 120 people.It has 6    
 stained glass windows,4 are of the    
 apostles,and the other two are of     
 St.Anne and St.Mary Magdalen.Around   
 the back half of the church,on the    
 wall,are wooden carvings of the       
 journey of Jesus,as he walked up the  
 road to Calvary carrying the cross.   
     Father Bradley is the Father of   
 the church,and lives in the house next
 door to it.Two sisters come over from 
 Guernsey and live near the church     
 also.One of them,Sister Francis,is    
 Head of the Infants Department at     
 St.Anne's school.                     
  The main island church is Church of  
 England and is in the See of          
 Winchester.The church is a magnificent
 building - sometimes called "The      
 Cathedral of The Channel Isles"
