		<title>16THE RIVER CAM_FLOODING</title>
		<content>    The River Cam is a tributary of the
 River Yeo. Queen Camel,West Camel,    
 Urgashay and Bridgehampton lie in the 
 lower half of the catchment and are   
 those frequently affected by flooding.
 The River Cam is small with extensive 
 tree cover over most of it's length.  
 There are 7 road bridges and several  
 accomodation bridges.A number of these
 cause large build ups of water during 
 high flows.The river responds quickly 
 to rainfall over the catchment and    
 flooding is a regular occurrence,     
 probably every 2_3 years.The 1979     
 event was the most severe , resulting 
 in flooding to 47 properties including
 farms ,shops,this school and a public 
 house.It occurred at the end of May.  
 The river burst it's banks at 9.00pm  
 and had flooded some homes by 11.00pm 
 to a depth of 1m.One farmer at        
 Langport lost all his 600 pigs.       </content>
