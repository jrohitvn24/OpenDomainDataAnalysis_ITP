		<content>     The area consists of most of      
 Elmore, and part of Longney and       
 Hardwicke. Most of it is rural, with a
 strong farming community. The         
 Gloucester and Sharpness Canal and the
 River Severn (famous for the Severn   
 Bore) run through the area and also   
 marks the divide between the rural    
 community and a large housing estate  
 at Hardwicke. Much of the land either 
 is or has been owned by the Guise     
 family, who now reside at Elmore Court
 (well worth a visit).                 
      Most types of people were        
 interviewed-including farmers,        
 villagers and comparative newcomers to
 the area. We found some interesting   
 houses-many going back to the 17th and
 18th centuries. Many are of timber    
 construction, with wattle and daub.   
 Many also have thatched roofs.
