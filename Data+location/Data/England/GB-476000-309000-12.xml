		<title>12***Grange Farm**************</title>
		<content>My grandfathers farm is called the     
Grange. It is on the Burrough Road. The
house is 90years old. It is very big   
and has a very big garden. There are   
six bedrooms upstairs, and four rooms  
downstairs, and it has two toilets     
.The farmer grows potatoes to sell at  
the farm. He also advertises in the    
Melton Times and he delivers in the    
district. He grows wheat and hay too.  
The farm has four sheds. He milks the  
cows by hand .He milks six cows and the
milk goes to the farmhouse and there's 
a bit for the cats.
