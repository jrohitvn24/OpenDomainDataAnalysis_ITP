		<content> old tools and machinery,bottles and   
 other articles which Mr. Squiers hopes
 to restore and have displayed in the  
 future.The Old Barn which was well    
 known in the area was destroyed by    
 fire in 1984.It was replaced by a     
 large modern barn and workshop.Parts  
 of the old barn are still to be seen  
 inside the new building.A large number
 of modern machines are used such as   
 combine harvester,tractors,spraying   
 machines.                             
    The farm produces mainly           
 bread-making wheat and rape seed from 
 which is obtained chip oil for frying.
 Smaller crops of borage and coriander 
 are also being grown.A small amount of
 livestock is also kept including      
 cattle and pigs.                      
    Although the farm is profitable    
 this has become harder to achieve in  
 recent years.                         </content>
