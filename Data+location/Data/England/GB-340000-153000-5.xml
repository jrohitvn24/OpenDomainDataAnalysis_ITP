		<content> There are a lot of different groups in
 the 1980's.Some of the more popular   
 groups include{Duran Duran, Wham, Paul
{Young, Tears for Fears and Frankie    
{Goes to Hollywood.}My favourite group 
 is{Duran Duran.}They consist of five  
 men who enjoy making music.The lead   
 singer,{Simon Le Bon,}is related to a 
 local doctor  and when he visits his  
 uncle the local fans go wild. Some    
 groups like{Frankie goes to Hollywood 
 write controversial songs such as{'Two
{Tribes'}.Their first single{'Relax'   
 was banned by the B.B.C and           
 consequently stayed at number one in  
 the charts for five weeks. The main   
 British charts are compiled by a      
 computerised company called{'Gallup'. 
 They show which records have sold the 
 most copies during a week.The one that
 has sold the most is number one. There
 are 40 records in the charts.         </content>
