MOTHER BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY POOR AND 
BEING ABLE TO GET THE MILK WITHOUT     
PAYING HELPED.  MR.JOHNSON REMEMBERED  
HELPING OUT ON THE STALLS ON THE CATTLE
MARKET. HE USED TO LOOK AFTER A STALL  
WHILE THE OWNER WENT TO THE PUBLIC     
HOUSE FOR HIS DINNER. THE PUBLIC HOUSES
IN LEEK USED TO STAY OPEN ALL DAY ON   
WEDNESDAY AND EVEN TODAY SOME PUBS     
STILL STAY OPEN BECAUSE WEDNESDAY IS   
STILL MARKET DAY. MR.JOHNSON           
REMEMBERED HIS SCHOOLDAYS WHICH HE     
SAID WERE A LOT DIFFERENT FROM OUR     
SCHOOLDAYS. HE TOLD US ABOUT ONE OF THE
TEACHERS WHO USED TO HIT THE CHILDREN  
ON THE HEAD IF THEY DIDN'T ANSWER THE  
QUESTIONS CORRECTLY.HE ALSO REMEMBERS  
SOME OF THE CHILDREN ATTENDING SCHOOL  
PART-TIME.THAT IS GOING IN TO SCHOOL   
IN THE MORNING AND WORKING IN THE MILLS
IN THE AFTERNOON. SCHOOLS HAVE CHANGED!</content>
