		<content> The wood is owned by the Salisbury    
 family but is managed by the          
 Hertfordshire/Barnet Countryside      
 Management Service. Twenty years ago  
 oak, ash and elm trees were felled and
 were replaced by softwoods;scots pine 
 and European larch. The trees are     
 thinned after 15 years and harvested  
 after 60 years. Only 12 acres called  
 Hammonds Wood has been left natural,  
 the trees are coppiced hornbeam and a 
 few ash and oaks. Coppicing has been  
 reintroduced recently to preserve the 
 wood.It also provides a better habitat
 for wildlife, a pair of sparrowhawks  
 have recently nested there. Young     
 seedlings have to be protected from   
 muntjac deer and rabbits. A rare tree,
 the wild service, is found in the wood
 which shows it is ancient. Bridleways 
 are marked by blue arrows, many horses
 use them which churns them up.        </content>
