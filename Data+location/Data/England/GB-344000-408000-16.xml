		<title>16Makentie Chicken Factory.</title>
		<content>The chicken factory is situated at     
G.R. 0347904106. It has produced       
poultry for 23 years and was started   
by Mr Entwistle, then the factory was  
taken   over by Makentie in 1977. Mr   
Entwistle sold eggs then sold fresh    
chickens. The chickens are brought in  
from {Dove Valley} Chickens in         
Derbyshire. Each day a van brings 2000 
chickens, they are dead,plucked &amp;      
cleaned when they arrive. Eight people 
work there and they tie the chickens   
up and steam cook them and add colour  
to give them a better look. They work  
for 5 days a week so cook {8-9         
thousand chickens per week.}They also  
deal with turkeys,ducks &amp; geese        
according to demand.{Markets} are      
supermarkets,chip shops &amp; butchers in  
Flint,Liverpool,Birmingham &amp; Preston.  
There is hope for expansion.
