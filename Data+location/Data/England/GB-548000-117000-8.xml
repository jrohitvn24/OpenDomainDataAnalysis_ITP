		<content> Staverton Nursery, is situated on the 
 busy A22. It is a family concern that 
 has been in business for nineteen     
 years. On the 21 acres of land are    
 grown mainly soft fruit, some         
 vegetables and flowers. Neighbouring  
 farmers supply the nursery with extra 
 produce. The family also runs a small 
 grocery store on the site which sells 
 all basic food requirements. The      
 nearest competition is about three    
 miles away in Uckfield. Trade comes   
 from the few local residents but      
 mainly from travellers on the A22.    
 Business is notably better in the     
 summer months with the increased      
 amount of tourists drawn to or through
 the area. The best seller is soft     
 fruit.At this time, staff numbers may 
 be temporarily increased from the     
 normal three employees, excluding     
 family.                               </content>
