pence, a lettuce 20p, a pound of butter
98p, a large white loaf 36p,and a tin

visited most frequently by parents of  
children in the school.   The most     
popular Newspaper bought here is the   
Â£Daily Express'.                       
     The village grocer's shop is owned
by 3 brothers who a few years ago won  
the B.B.C. National Shopkeeper of the  
Year competition.    The shop is       
popular because of the friendly and    
cheerful personalities of the owners.  
They will deliver grocery orders to the
houses of old people who can't get out.</content>
