		<title>05A visit to Bathpool,Talke</title>
		<content> When we visited our Domesday square we
saw Target Wood with many deciduous    
trees.We walked over this log where    
Craig nearly fell in and saw two       
screeching kestrels after a            
squirrel.Before we walked through      
Ashenough Farm we heard some hens and  
pigs,saw a sign which read Â£sheep      
grazing keep dogs out'and we saw the   
sheep grazing in the field.We walked   
over this railway bridge near a playing
field with swings and an old steam     
roller.We reached the pavement and     
copied a road sign of the Talke        
roundabout then walked to Harecastle   
Farm,a stuart building which we        
visited.Later,and sketched the oak roof
beams.
