		<title>18PIER PAVILION IN HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> The Pier Pavilion is the main Sports  
 Centre in Herne Bay and it is the best
 in the area. Many clubs make use of   
 the main hall and of the smaller rooms
 which are cheaper to hire. Also       
 individuals may book the facilities   
 for their sport with the squash and   
 table tennis rooms being particularly 
 popular. The high standard of Herne   
 Bay's roller hockey is maintained in  
 this pavilion with National League    
 matches played at the week ends.      
 Basketball, gymnastics, keep fit,     
 badminton, football and volleyball are
 other sports which make use of the    
 main arena. Although the pavilion is a
 great asset to the town there were    
 doubts raised as to whether it should 
 have been built in such an exposed    
 position as it is liable to damage    
 during storms.                        
                                       </content>
