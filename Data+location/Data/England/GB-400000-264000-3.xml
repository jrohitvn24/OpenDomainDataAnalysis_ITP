		<content> The houses are mainly owner occupied  
 and range from Â£13.000- Â£80.000 in    
 value. They are terraced, detached,   
 semi-detached,cottages,bungalows,small
 rambling farmhouses and 2 or 3 storied
 blocks of flats. They vary greatly in 
 shape,size and design. Some of the    
 bungalows have been specially built   
 for old age pensioners and are grouped
 together all within easy reach of     
 help. In addition, each bungalow has  
 an alarm in the event of an           
 emergency.A paid warden is in charge  
 of the bungalows.There are 2 local    
 authority "children in care" homes, a 
 Cheshire Home for the physically      
 disabled, particularly those suffering
 from Multiple Sclerosis and several   
 old peoples homes. Some of the new    
 houses have been built on marshy      
 ground interlaced with underground    
 springs causing bad settlement.       </content>
