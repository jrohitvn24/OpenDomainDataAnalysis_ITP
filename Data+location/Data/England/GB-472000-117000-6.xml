		<content> The larger percentage of farmland is  
 owner occupied, with some tennanted   
 acres, is approximately 938 acres and 
 is divided into 2 main soil types,    
 upper greensand &amp; chalk downland.     
 Winter and spring sown barley and     
 wheat are the chief cereals to be     
 grown (522 a) with peas, maize, kale  
 and short term grass leas used as     
 break crops to increase soil fertility
 and to minimise the propogation of    
 cereal diseases. There are 2 sizeable 
 milking herds and a flock of sheep    
 grazing some 416 acres of grassland,  
 which comprises permanent pasture and 
 short term leas. Grass is also        
 conserved for winter stock feed as    
 silage and engaged in agriculture is  
 much reduced, owing to greater        
 mechanisation. All farmland is        
 interspersed with large afforested    
 areas.3 households keep chicken/ducks.</content>
