		<content> Most of the football matches are play-
 ed on Saturday or Sunday. They do not 
 play in the summer. If they lose a    
 game it is only by the odd goal. When 
 I watch they mostly win. They have a  
 practice every Tuesday from 7pm to    
 9.30pm. First they run around, then   
 exercise and then they just have a    
 game. They are going to have two teams
 and two managers. The oldest player is
 35 and the youngest ones are 17.      
 There are 22 members of the Cricket   
 Club which meets at the village       
 playing field and was started in 1984.
 A groundsman is responsible for       
 looking after the wicket with the     
 help of club members. There are about 
 30 matches in a season. Up to July 7th
 1985 the highest individual score has 
 been 164 runs. Wednesday is Club      
 practice night and Tuesday is practice
 for 7-13 year olds.                   </content>
