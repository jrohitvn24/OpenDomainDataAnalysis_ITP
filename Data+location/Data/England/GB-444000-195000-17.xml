   Every Monday night at 7.00 pm a     
group of girls meet down by the church 
in our Guide Hut. The hut was once a   
house for two shepherds but it has     
been cleared out and is now a Guide    
Hut .                                  
   Guides finishes at 8.30pm. Our subs 
are 25p a week.                        
   We go out a lot and sometimes       
have sports day. We celebrate certain  
years of Guiding and have parties,we   
also have parties for Hallowe'en,      
Christmas and Easter.                  
   Some of our Guides went down        
to Oxford to celebrate 75 years of     
Guiding in June 1985.                  
   We go to to camp every year so we   
have lessons on it, we also cook       
outside. We do sponsored walks and     
things for charity.                    
   We have a good time at Guides.      </content>
