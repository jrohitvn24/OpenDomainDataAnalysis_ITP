		<content>   Two main roads serve the area,the   
 A382 Moreton to Bovey Tracey in the   
 Wray valley and the B3212 Moreton to  
 Exeter which climbs to Cossick Cross  
 then drops to Doccombe.               
   Single decker buses run on weekdays,
 2 each way on the A382 and 4 each way 
 on the B3212.School buses to local    
 State schools and Hospital car service
 are available.The majority of house_  
 holders own a car and consider it     
 essential.                            
   Narrow lanes wind all over the area,
 determined by the lie of land.They are
 well maintained,frequently single     
 track,sunken between stone walls and  
 hedges.                               
   Away from the main roads the traffic
 is sparse,farm vehicles and local cars
 The two main roads carry heavier      
 traffic than they were built for      
 especially in holiday periods.        </content>
