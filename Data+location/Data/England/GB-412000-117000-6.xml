		<title>06A Breamore housewife's day</title>
		<content>                                       
 I've lived in Breamore for just over  
 two years now.We're restoring a       
 thatched cottage sited just on the    
 edge of the village common,and loving 
 every minute of it. A typical day for 
 me begins rather early with my husband
 feeding the outside part of our       
 menagerie(ducks,geese,horses) while I 
 feed the inside(my two sons , the dogs
 and the cats).I then run my elder son 
 to the local school,my husband leaves 
 for work in the city and I've got the 
 day to devote to gardening,housework  
 (Ugh!) and my baby,one of Dr Steptoe's
 test-tube miracles. He keeps me busy  
 so I take little part in village      
 community life. Perhaps I shall one   
 day but for now,I enjoy my own company
 and the tranquility that, for me, is  
 quite the nicest thing about living in
 Breamore.                             </content>
