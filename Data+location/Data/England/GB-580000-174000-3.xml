		<content> St.Mary Hoo is still a farming centre.
 Of the sixty_odd houses in the parish,
 only eleven are now occupied by farm  
 workers.   St.Mary's Hall, Ross and   
 Coombe farms, together with much of   
 the drained marshes belong to the     
 Church Commission.  Newlands and Fenn 
 Farms are privately owned.  One of the
 farmhouses has been turned into a     
 restaurant.   The Parochial School,   
 built in 1868 is now a private house  
 as is St.Mary's Church, though the    
 graveyard remains unaltered.          
 There is a public house, the Fenn     
 Bell, and a small industrial          
 development also at Fenn.             
 At Barn Street there is a shop and sub
 Post Office and a garage that does    
 repairs but does not sell petrol any  
 longer.
