		<title>09       TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>   We discovered, during interviews,   
 that  all  people  whom  we           
 investigated possessed at least one   
 car and, on the whole, there was      
 little dependence  on  a  bus service 
 which in some cases, is only  a       
 Saturday  service. There is no railway
 system, the  nearest being the        
 Shrewsbury line.  Roads are  narrow   
 prohibiting much movement of vehicles 
 large than vans. Larger transport     
 merely connect between farm and their 
 destinations eg. dairies.             
   We saw a  simple eight propeller    
 light aircraft used as a crop sprayer 
 in the vicinity  of  lower Springs and
 also a helicopter used for the same   
 purpose.                              
   Upon investigation we found that    
 shopping is done in the areas outside 
 our grid, as show in the graph.
