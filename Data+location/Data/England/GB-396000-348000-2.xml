		<title>02Churnet valley &amp; Consall .</title>
		<content>Tourism is in this area is because of  
the nearness to Alton Towers and the   
beauty of the Churnet valley. The river
Churnet runs through Cheddleton,       
Froghall and Oakamoor and joins with   
the Cauldon canal at Consall Forge.    
The canal was used for transporting    
limestone, ironore and wood for the    
iron industry which was important in   
the valley in the 16th and 17th        
centuries. Later in the 19th           
century a railway was also built to    
aid transport but this is no longer    
used. Today the canal is used for      
pleasure with barge holidays and day   
trips being very popular the success   
of these and the natural beauty of     
Consall forge has allowed the Black    
Lion pub to remain popular despite the 
fact it has no main public access      
road.
