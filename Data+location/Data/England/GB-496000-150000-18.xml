    Separate training is given for     
 recruits, warrant officers and        
 non-commissioned officers. They do not
 train with weapons. These are used for
 defensive purposes only. The camp was 
 opened in 1941, rebuilt in 1964 and   
 opened by the Queen. It covers 51     
 acres of land.  They have four types  
 of sleeping accommodation: the        
 officers' mess, sergeants' mess,      
 recruit and staff accommodation and   
 warrant officers' mess.They have four 
 types of uniform: summer, winter, a   
 summer dress and a parade uniform. The
 highest rank a woman can have here is 
 a full colonel. To be able to join    
 you need to be 17 years 3 months. It  
 has the largest parade square in the  
 U.K. The band is the only female      
 service band left. There are two      
 chapels and a medical centre.         </content>
