		<content> A spot survey conducted in the Square 
 one July afternoon, while not being   
 numerous enough to give reliable      
 results, did show a majority of       
 tourists from the North of England (a 
 coach tour had just arrived) closely  
 followed by the United States. Many   
 coach tours do stop in Stow and there 
 are usually several cars with Western 
 European numberplates to be seen.     
  Many tourists are drawn by the many  
 antique shops (see p.2) but most come 
 simply to appreciate the countryside  
 and the charm of the town. Lower Swell
 also has two small hotels that offer  
 perhaps a little more peace than the  
 centre of Stow.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
