		<content>Barby Primary School was built some    
seventeen years ago.  The school caters
for children between the ages of four  
and eleven years after which they go to
secondary school in Daventry.  There   
are four classes of mixed ability      
children and approximately 100         
children attend school.  The school day
begins at 9.00 a.m. and ends at 3.45   
p.m. There is a lunch break of one and 
a quarter hours.  A meal is served at  
mid-day at a cost of 55p although in   
cases of hardship this fee is waived.  
                                       
The school has a library, a            
television,a radio and a computer. The 
children are encouraged to work        
individually or in small groups, to    
make their own decisions and to locate 
and use informatom from a variety of   
sources.
