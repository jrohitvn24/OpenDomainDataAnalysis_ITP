		<content> In the area bounded by the Northolme, 
 Trinity street,Bridge street and      
 Ropery road,most of the houses are    
 terraced.Since 1971 many of these     
 houses have been improved with the    
 help of grants,new roofs,bathrooms,new
 windows and indoor toilets have been  
 added and many of the houses have been
 modernised.Between Sandsfield lane and
 Lea road there are semi_detatched     
 houses with front gardens.In some     
 areas traffic problems occur as cars  
 have to be parked in the streets where
 houses have no garages.There is a     
 large area of detatched family housing
 on the uphill Estate the Welmar Estate
 off the Avenue and the Enness Estates 
 off Middlefield lane.There are many   
 council houses in the uphill area.Some
 of these were built after the war and 
 some more recently for people who came
 to work in Gainsborough from London.  </content>
