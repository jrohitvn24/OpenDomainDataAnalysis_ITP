		<content> It is a favourite spot for holiday    
 makers, its position off the main     
 routes making it a place of quiet and 
 peace.  The population of about 700   
 who are not retired or employed in    
 farming, travel to the surrounding    
 towns for work in light industry or   
 retailing.  This village is noted for 
 its caring attitude one to the other. 
 The people, a mixture of newcomers    
 and those who can trace their families
 back several generations, involve     
 themselves in the community either    
 throuh church or village hall projects
 and also help causes farther afield.  
 You do not need to wait twenty years  
 to become accepted as a member of the 
 familiy of this community.
