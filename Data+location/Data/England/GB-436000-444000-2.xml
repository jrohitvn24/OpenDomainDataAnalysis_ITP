		<content> From statistics aquired from the local
 council and a survey we discoverd the 
 following information.                
 In the area there are 3479 people and 
 of them about 20% are children, also  
 18% of the population are             
 pensioners.The average age in the     
 area is about 45 years old.Since 1971 
 the population has grown by one fith. 
 In the last 15 years about half the   
 population has moved into this area   
 but the residents still do not think  
 the area is over populated.Nearly     
 everyone owns there own house but a   
 minority of people do rent a house.   
 Most people live with one other person
 in their family. Only 8% of the       
 population are jobless. Three quarters
 of the adult population own a car.This
 area has a fairly mobile population.
