		<title>03WOOTTON HALL - Wootton Wawen</title>
		<content>     Wootton Hall was built in 1687.   
 It is built of stone and has a former 
 Roman Catholic chapel nearby.  The    
 Hall has had many owners and its      
 history includes references to Mrs.   
 Fitzherbert and George IV.            
                                       
     The present owner has converted   
 part of the grounds into a Mobile Home
 Park.  The Hall and chapel building   
 are now used for residential purposes,
 as a country club and for dances and  
 entertainment.                        
                                       
     The River Alne flows through the  
 grounds, feeding pools used for       
 leisure purposes.  A large heronry is 
 well-established.
