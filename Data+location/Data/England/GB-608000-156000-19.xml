		<title>19 The Gate Services</title>
		<content>The petrol filling station at the Gate 
Services near Dunkirk employs 9 staff  
on a shift system with a 24 hour       
service.Shifts are of eight hours      
each,except the night shift which is 11
hours.As with most filling stations,the
owners have developed a small shop     
around the pay desk to catch the       
motorist or lorry driver with a        
thirst,a car problem or a present to   
buy.The items sold include icecreams   
and drinks,car accessories,toys,ready  
food for the hungry traveller in the   
form of ham or cheese rolls and fresh  
flowers for the wife or girlfriend.On  
the Canterbury bound side of the road a
new garage has been built one year ago 
and a new Little Chef restaurant is    
near completion.
