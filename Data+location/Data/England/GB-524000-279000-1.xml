		<content> The l2 square kilometres within this  
 grid are largely arable farmland with 
 three small villages and a few        
 scattered farmhouses.  In the         
 following pages an attempt has been   
 made to give a view of the land, its  
 use, ecology and history as well as   
 the life of the people who live and   
 work here.  Their housing, education  
 and health facilities, those for      
 recreation and sport, their transport 
 and employment difficulties as well   
 a little about their home life styles 
 and religious beliefs are all briefly 
 written about.  We have also touched  
 on the government of the area and the 
 communication systems that exist.  It 
 is hoped that from this information,  
 it may be possible to envisage the    
 life of the people of the area during 
 the middle of the l980's.
