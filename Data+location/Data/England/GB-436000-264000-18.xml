		<title>18THE RIDGEWAY - A GIPSY TRACK</title>
		<content>   In years gone by,{gipsies}were a    
 familiar sight along the Fosse Way and
 would often set up camp on the        
{Ridgeway}(known locally as Green Lane)
 south of Hunningham.                  
   As many as 4 or 5{caravans}would be 
 drawn up on the narrow grass verges,  
 complete with wood fires, dogs,       
 (usually whippets or lurchers) and    
 sometimes even a few bantam chickens. 
 Washing would be laid out to dry on   
 the hedgerows.                        
   The smallish but sturdy horses were 
 almost always piebald or skewbald and 
 often two to a caravan.               
  {Since those days the gipsies have   
{declined in number but as recently as 
{1983 a gipsy family camped near the   
{Long Itchington Road, complete with   
{painted caravan and piebald pony.     
                                       
                                       </content>
