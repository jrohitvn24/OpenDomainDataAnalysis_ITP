		<content>  This society was formed in 1944 by   
 farmers in the New Forest Area who    
 wished to prevent the transference of 
 disease in cattle while mating.   This
 is how Artificial Insemination first  
 came into use.                        
  The society has a main centre in     
 south Lyndhurst, they cover an area   
 south to the Isle of Wight, north as  
 far as the M4 and N.E. to Basingstoke.
  The society operates internationally,
 sending straws of semen to Canada,    
 Germany and many other countries.     
 Also members travel to these countries
 to buy cattle such as Holsteins from  
 Canada, which are good for milk, and  
 also Friesians although quarantine    
 restrictions have been making cattle  
 importing harder recently.
