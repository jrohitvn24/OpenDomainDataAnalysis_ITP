		<title>09Wolverhampton Housing Scheme</title>
		<content>The houses in Low Hill were built in   
1936,and by the late 1970's were       
deteriorating.So the council decided to
modernise or demolish them.Those houses
being modernised are fitted with modern
conveniences such as upstairs toilets, 
bathrooms and central heating.The      
tenants also had the choice of altering
the layout of the house.While this was 
being done,occupants had the choice of 
moving temporarily,moving permanently, 
or staying put while the work went on  
around them.If the tenants decide to   
move temporarily they receive #42.If   
they stay while modernisation takes    
place they receive #72.If houses were  
being demolished,the area would be     
landscaped for residents to enjoy.The  
cost of modernising each house is      
#13000 while the overall cost for the  
whole project will be about #12        
million. (NB: # = pounds)              </content>
