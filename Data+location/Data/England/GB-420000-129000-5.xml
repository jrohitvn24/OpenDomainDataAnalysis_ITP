		<title>05A FARMER'S DAY IN FARLEY</title>
		<content> Mr. David Parsons owns and farms      
 Parsonage Farm and also farms Farley  
 Farm with General Fanshawe.           
 Every day, except Thursday, he gets up
 at quarter to seven. On Thursday he   
 milks the cows at five o'clock and he 
 gets up at half past four. Most days  
 he goes straight out to the dairy-man 
 to check for any problems. The two    
 tractor drivers arrive at eight       
 o'clock and Mr. Parsons gives them    
 orders for the day. Then he goes to   
 breakfast from quarter past eight to  
 quarter past nine. This is usually    
 cereal and toast. He only has a cooked
 breakfast on Thursday.                
 After breakfast the work varies from  
 day to day depending on the time of   
 year and weather. There are always the
 cattle to check, paper work to do and 
 machine repairs to do. He has to go to
 Salisbury for spares and to the market</content>
