		<title>12DUTIES IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> My duties consist of a two shift      
 system,0800hrs-1600hrs or             
 1600hrs-mid.To take a typical         
 0800hrs-1600hrs duty, my first task   
 would be to book on duty.This is      
 achieved by VHF radio to Police HQ and
 by telephoning my sub-divisional      
 station at Petersfield who would      
 inform me of urgent calls requiring   
 attention,eg overnight                
 burglary,accident.I would attend these
 calls by motorcycle and on completion 
 collect any non-urgent enquiries,eg   
 firearms enquiries, summonses         
 warrant,from Petersfield.             
 I would then return to my beat,       
 checking unoccupied houses, perhaps a 
 farm or school visit and general      
 liason with the community.            
 At some time during the day I would   
 try to be at the beat office to deal  
 with any local enquires.              </content>
