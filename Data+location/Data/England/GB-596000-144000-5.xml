		<title>05TUTT HILL (1)</title>
		<content> Tutt Hill takes it's name from the    
 high ground on which it stands, it is 
 a collection of dwelling houses set   
 between the Ashford/London railway    
 line and the A20 Trunk road which     
 dominates the square.                 
                                       
 The M20 Motor-way extention will add  
 to the isolation of the area which is 
 flat low level grassland. Tutt Hill is
 the place where the Motor-way will    
 change direction from N.W. to W. and  
 also provides the main access to a    
 section of Motor-way works.           
                                       
 Construction of the bridge to carry   
 the railway over the Motor-way here is
 in progress, this will cause          
 disruption and noise at least until   
 the early 1990s.
