		<content>   The village of Chew Stoke and       
 Nempnett Thrubwell form a small part  
 of the{Bath Division.}I am supervised 
 by Officer's from my local            
 headquarters at{Keynsham.}            
   I share the responsibility for      
 policing the 8 villages which form my 
 beat, with another locally based      
 constable. We both live in detached   
 houses which have a part of the       
 building set aside as Police Stations.
   I am supplied with a 7 cwt van which
 is fitted with both VHF and UHF       
 radios. For my personnel protection, I
 am issued with a flame proof uniform  
 and reinforced helmet, a short wooden 
 truncheon and set of handcuffs.       
   My role as Community Policeman      
 requires me to be 1 of the community, 
 while still being responsible for     
 maintaining law and order.
