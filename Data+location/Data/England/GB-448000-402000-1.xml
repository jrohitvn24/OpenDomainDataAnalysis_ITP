   The villages of Barnburgh and       
 Harlington are interrelated,it is     
 difficult to see where one village    
 ends and the other begins.  Fifteen to
 twenty years ago a single track       
 railway separated them but now the    
 railway has disappeared and the       
 cutting has been filled in and the    
 definite division has gone,the thin   
 strip of land remaining is often      
 referred to as "no-man's land".       
   The villages still sit in lovely    
 countryside,despite their quite       
 considerable growth over recent years 
 and even though Barnburgh Colliery    
 stands close by. The villages contain 
 a mixture of old,architecturally      
 interesting  buildings, farms and     
 cottages, and new buildings , houses  
 and bungalows.                        </content>
