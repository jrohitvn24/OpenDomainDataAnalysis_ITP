		<title>13FIRE FIGHTING APPLIANCES</title>
		<content>    There are 3 fire fighting          
 appliances at the training school so  
 that students can practise and learn  
 how to deal with many types of fires. 
    One has a hydraulic lift, which can
 reach a height of 54 feet when        
 extended, and it has a powerful engine
 so that it can reach an aircraft fire 
 very quickly as every second counts.  
    Three separate types of{foam}are   
 used as well as{water}which can be    
 distributed through a cannon from the 
 top of the vehicle. A distributor     
 mounted at the front prevents a fire  
 from getting underneath the vehicle.  
    The school uses the most{modern    
{type of vehicles}which are used on    
 airfields around the world, so that   
 the recruits are familiar with the    
 appliances they may be using when they
 finish the course and return home.
