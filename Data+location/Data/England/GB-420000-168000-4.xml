		<title>04CHURCH FARM,MILDENHALL</title>
		<content>{Church Farm}is in Mildenhall and is a 
 very large farm for this country.It is
 over 1100 acres in size and is a      
 typical mixed farm.Its joint owner{Mr 
{J.Anslie,}rents the land from 3       
 different landlords.The farm is highly
 mechanised with 2 Combine             
 Harvesters,1 bailer,2 seed drills,4   
 harrows,1 elevator,1 bail sledge,6    
 trailers,8 ploughs,9 tractors,1       
 spraying machine and a JCB.There are  
 very few people working on such a     
 large farm (18) because the machines  
 do most of the work.They grow 2 main  
 crops - high yielding wheat and barley
 as well as grass for silage.These     
 crops are regularly sprayed with      
 pesticides,insecticides and           
 fungicides.They also keep 300 pigs and
 260 dairy cattle in carefully         
 regulated conditions,and they use a   
 rotating milking carousel.            </content>
