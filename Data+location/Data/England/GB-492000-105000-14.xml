		<content> COUNCIL MEETING MAY 1985              
 In reply to a letter from the council 
 expressing concren about the speed of 
 locally,the chief constable wrote that
 although the miners, strike was now   
 over, the force was still streched,   
 but that everything possible would be 
 done to improve the situation.        
 whilst discssing this matter, the news
 correspondet requested that note be   
 made that the council,s concern report
 in notes on the april meeting of the  
 councl was particularly with regard to
 the policing of the traffic, especilly
 on the A.29, and not, as may have been
 inferred, to general policing in the  
 area.                                 
 It was also noted that a police survey
 on traffic speed in the area is to be 
 carried out shortly.
