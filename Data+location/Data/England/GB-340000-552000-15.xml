		<title>15JOB SURVEY TAKEN IN SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>  We visited the juniors asking if they
 had close relatives over the age of   
 sixteen that worked. We divided the   
 jobs into  vaious types and the       
 results showed that 35 people worked  
 in retail selling or delivering. We   
 recorded 31 factory workers and 29    
 people privately employed. We expected
 fewer. Service and medical jobs came  
 next they each had 21 workers. We     
 thought there would be more medical   
 workers as two hospitals are close by.
 There were 10 Council employees and 10
 self employed,more than we expected.We
 counted 6 railway men but expected    
 more, because of the importance of    
 railways in Carlisle. Banks and post  
 offices had 3 workers, and there was 1
 farmer.We expected none in our town   
 school.Our'any other'category included
 1 office job,2 who worked in 14 M.U.,4
 RAF men,1 pilot and a hotel worker.   </content>
