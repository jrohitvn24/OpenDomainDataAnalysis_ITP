		<content>     One farm, situated within CASTLE  
 CARROCK, was taken as a typical       
 example of the type of animal farming 
 carried on in the area.               
                                       
     This farm totalled 136 acres, and 
 rented another 40 acres for summer    
 grazing.                              
                                       
     There were 65 milking cows and 140
 young cattle.   The 50 sheep were kept
 for lambing and several hoggs were    
 also reared.                          
                                       
     Other farms within the area keep  
 hens, ducks and geese for eggs and    
 table birds.   Horses are also kept on
 some farms, although only one pony    
 trap is regularly driven - by a Fell  
 Pony.   All farms employ working dogs,
 usually Border Collies.
