		<content> They started their own tours four or  
 five years ago and now often go       
 abroad.The general demand for tours   
 abroad is to France, Germany, Holland,
 Belguim and Austria. The furthest they
 have ever been is Barcelona in Spain. 
 When they interview drivers the first 
 quality they want is for them to be   
 clean, neat and tidy because Tates    
 coaches feel their drivers should     
 always be reasonably tidy, even if    
 they are only taking local children to
 the swimming pool.They should also be 
 polite and pleasant.Then they look at 
 their driving records and they prefer 
 someone experienced.They do not plan  
 to expand but over the years they     
 probably will.
