   Stoke House is an attractive country
house owned by Mr. Vinton, an American.
It dates back from the later part of   
the Georgian Era. It is a red brick    
building with a slate roof. 36 acres of
parkland surround the house. There is a
stable block, an ornamental lake, 4    
acres of gardens, a swimming pool, a   
tennis court, a lodge and a gardeners  
cottage. The trees in the park suffered
from Dutch Elm Disease and were        
replaced by Oak, Ash, and Poplars. Mr  
and Mrs Vinton have started to breed   
horses. They are hunters and at present
they have eight horses. They employ 1  
groom and a girl from the Youth        
Training Scheme to look after them. Mr.
Frohawk is the head gardener and he has
a part time helper. A lady works daily 
in the house.
