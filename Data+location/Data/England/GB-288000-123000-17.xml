		<title>17Local Controversy</title>
		<content>  Certainly the subject that arouses   
 the strongest feeling is Hunting. The 
 presence of the League Against Cruel  
 Sports as quite a large landowner     
 makes the situation more critical and 
 is an aggravation to the many local   
 people who are very strongly pro-     
 hunting.                              
  Staghunting provokes the keenest     
 controversy. Many dislike the princ-  
 iple and the apparent arrogance of    
 some hunt followers, but fear that the
 deer may not survive the abolition of 
 hunting, after which farmers might not
 tolerate the damage deer do to crops  
 and banks. Others who did not feel    
 very strongly said they kept quiet as 
 they had neighbours who supported both
 factions.                             
  Several people whi live near the over
 head power line found the interference
 almost intolerabe and unsightly.      </content>
