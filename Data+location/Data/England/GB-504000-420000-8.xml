		<title>08A DAY IN THE LIFE OF CHRIS 1</title>
		<content> On Saturday I went downstairs at about
 9 o'clock.I fetched my telescope out  
 and tried to focus it on a thorn      
 bush.Then I tried a bird but they were
 too fast so I decided to have some    
 breakfast.I had Corn Flakes and a     
 drink of milk.Then I went upstairs to 
 get dressed.I took my penknife out    
 because I thought I would be          
 constructing weapons or cutting       
 branches.But first I went to James    
 Pitmans house.We went into the wood   
 for sticks,and I found the perfect    
 stick for a catapult and James got me 
 some elastic and we fixed it to the   
 wood.Then I went home for dinner.I had
 tomato soup and a drink of milk.After 
 dinner I went back to James house and 
 we went back into the wood.Then we    
 heard something that sounded like a   
 chainsaw but it was really a          
 motorbike.                            </content>
