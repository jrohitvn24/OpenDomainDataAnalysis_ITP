		<content> HOME LIFE.                            
 Most people own their own homes;many  
 of those who live in council houses   
 are now buying them.                  
 Many wives go out to work as well as  
 husbands,even if their employment is  
 only part-time.The main meal prepared 
 by most women is the evening          
 meal,eaten when husbands get home from
 work.Husbands are frequently required 
 to travel overseas or to other parts  
 of this country in connection with    
 their work.Mothers are then left for  
 several days,managing the home and    
 caring for the children on their own. 
 Mothers help each other with the      
 children in many ways.                
 Most families keep at least one       
 domestic pet,cats or dogs being by far
 the most popular.
