 school at the age of{5}either at Old  
 Mill or at Orchard Primary School.At  
{11}they transfer to high school.Thomas
 Estley Community College opened in{   
{1976.}Now{507}children attend.Mr.     
 Gelsthorpe thinks this number is fine,
 because it's just right for all the   
 activities available.There are around 
{40}teachers at the college.           
 Registration is at{9.05}and afternoon 
 school ends at{3.20p.m. }Mr.Gelsthorpe
 thinks they have an advantage over    
 other colleges because of their good  
 staff.Another advantage is that they  
 have a new,modern building.To keep the
 school running they need around{      
{Â£20,000.}This doesn't include the     
 money that goes to pay the staff's    
 wages.The college is used by other    
 clubs and groups.Every year they raise
 money for funds such as Ethiopia.     </content>
