		<title>18TRAFFIC PROBLEMS ON A1.</title>
		<content> The part of the north/south A1 through
{Bedfordshire}is standard non-motorway 
 type dual carriage way. It carries a  
 huge volume of traffic each day, both 
 long distance and local. The stretch  
 going north from the{Black Cat        
{Roundabout}bisects the village of{    
{Wyboston}and is a notorious accident  
 black-spot. People living on the west 
 side of the A1 experience great       
 problems when trying to cross the     
 north bound carriage way to get to the
 south bound one. First thing in the   
 morning and late in the afternoon     
 waits of upto 20 minutes are quite    
 common, and you take your life in your
 hands when do you cross. The local    
 community is campaigning for a flyover
 such as the one that has been approved
 for a similar situation 20 miles north
 at Sawtry. At present they have been  
 told it will have to wait.            </content>
