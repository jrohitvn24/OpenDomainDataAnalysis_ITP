		<content>   The population of the area has      
 increased dramatically in the last 20 
 years, but despite that, new residents
 are aware of a sense of community.    
 There has been much infilling, but the
 shape of the villages has changed     
 little. The highest point is still the
 tower of St.Nicolas church and a      
 clearly defined belt of open land     
 surrounds the villages.               
 It is an affluent area with a good age
 mix. Most families have at least one  
 car and as a result public transport  
 is very poor, both road and rail. Most
 property is privately owned though    
 there are 3 council estates and       
 several old peoples residences. There 
 are many voluntary clubs, but despite 
 a large population, few are actively  
 engaged in running them. For children 
 there are Scouts, Guides, Boys &amp; Girls
 Brigades and youth clubs.             </content>
