		<title>14The Wolford Festival</title>
		<content> During the Weekend 19-21 July, the    
 Wolfords celebrated the 150th         
 anniversary of the Reconsecration of  
 the Parish Church in 1835. On Friday  
 evening we enjoyed a concert by the   
 Campden singers. Refreshments were    
 served and the Church was beautifully 
 decorated with flowers. The floral    
 arrangements were part of a flower    
 festival visited by many people over  
 the weekend. Also on display were old 
 photographs. On Saturday there were   
 exhibitions of old farm machinery and 
 tools, a children's farm yard and     
 stories were told to children by      
 H.E.Todd. In the evening a            
 dance/barbecue was held at Nethercote.
 On Sunday two special church services 
 were held, the second being a festal  
 evensong presided over by Bishop Gibbs
 and attended by a visiting Choir and  
 Organist.                             </content>
