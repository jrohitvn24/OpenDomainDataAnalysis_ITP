		<title>04Cottages and Farmhouses</title>
		<content>   The houses in this area can be      
 described as old cottages and         
 farmhouses built of local granite.Two 
 houses,Wray Barton and Doccombe Mill  
 were registered in the first Domesday 
 Book.There is no new housing in the   
 area,but a few agricultural barns have
 been converted into dwellings, for    
 private homes and holiday accommod_   
 ation.                                
   There are farm complexes, isolated  
 cottages and a group of fifteen houses
 on either side of the B3212 known as  
 Doccombe.The houses are privately     
 owned execpt for two cottages owned by
 the South West Water Authority.       
   All properties are served by mains  
 electricity and have their own spring 
 water and sceptic tanks.              
   There are a number of ruined farm   
 houses forcibly abandoned for fear of 
 polution of the  reservoirs.          </content>
