		<content> School Games in the Rec.              
    We walk to the Rec. in our football
 kit with our teacher Mr Constable.    
 Tuesday afternoon is the time we      
 practise and then on Fridays after    
 school the 'A' and 'B' teams are      
 given further coaching. We leave bags 
 on the bench and begin to train.      
    Football is a game of skill and we 
 practise passing, headers and throwing
 on. There are seven people in the     
 team, a goalie, two defenders, one    
 mid-field and three forwards. Boys    
 play to the Junior Rules. We have     
 entered the Errey's Tournament on     
 Saturday 12 October and the Small     
 Schools Tournament on Wednesday 16    
 October.                              
    I think we stand a good chance of  
 winning a cup because we've fielded a 
 strong side this term.
