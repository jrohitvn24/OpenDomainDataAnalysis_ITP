		<content>PUBLIC TRANSPORT IS NOT VERY GOOD AND  
SO PEOPLE HAVE A CAR.THE BUS           
SERVICE IS RUN BY UNITED COUNTIES.YOU  
CAN GET TO MILTON KEYNES IN ONE        
DIRECTION AND TO WELLINGBOROUGH IN THE 
OTHER.THERE IS ALSO A BUS TO LONDON    
THAT PASSES THROUGH THE VILLAGE.IT     
STARTS FROM CORBY AND COMES THROUGH    
MORNING AND EVENING ON WEEK DAYS BUT   
THERE ARE LESS AT WEEKENDS.            
MANY PEOPLE IN BOZEAT NOW HAVE TWO CARS
BECAUSE THERE IS A GREATER TREND FOR   
MUMS TO GO OUT TO WORK,COUPLED WITH    
THE POOR BUS SERVICE.                  
THE NEAREST RAILWAY STATIONS ARE AT    
WELLINGBOROUGH OR NORTHAMPTON..
