		<title>08A Saturday in the life of...</title>
		<content> On Saturday I wake up at about half   
 past 7 and read for about an          
 hour.After breakfast,I wash and clean 
 my teeth,then take my dog,Tim,for a   
 long walk,sometimes letting him off   
 his lead.At about quarter to 11 we set
 off for Judo.If Dad goes to work in   
 the car it's a lot earlier as we have 
 to go on our bikes.Judo finishes at   
 about twenty past 12.Once home,we have
 some dinner,then I either play on my  
 computer,watch television or play     
 out,unless we have something special  
 we have to do.In the evening I have a 
 bath,then watch television till about 
 half past 9 (unless there is a good   
 film on the television).This is a     
 typical Saturday in the life of Philip
 Worthington.I am 11 years of age and  
 live at 20 Victoria Park              
 Avenue,Lea,Preston.
