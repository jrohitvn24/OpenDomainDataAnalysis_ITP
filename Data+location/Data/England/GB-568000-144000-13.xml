		<title>13HOP GROWING</title>
		<content>A hop is a vine, a tall climbing plant 
which needs a network of poles and     
strings to support it when growing. It 
costs 2500 pounds per acre to set this 
network up. Some farms in our area grow
Yeoman hops which are very bitter. Most
hop gardens are surrounded by hedges to
protect the plants from wind. Hops are 
used in the brewing of beer. The hops  
stop the beer from turning sour. The   
planting takes place in October and the
hops are harvested in September. Today 
the hops are picked by machine: the    
whole vine is cut and taken to the     
picking machine. In the past people    
came down to Kent to pick the hops in  
the summer and stayed in "hop pickers  
huts" After harvesting the hops are    
taken to the oasthouse where they are  
dried and packed before being sent to  
the Hop Marketing Board's warehouse in 
Paddock Wood for storage until needed. </content>
