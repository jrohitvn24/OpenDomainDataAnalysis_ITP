		<title>06 Cubs and Brownies.</title>
		<content>     One of the things that we enjoy in
Leomansley is going to Cubs and        
Brownies. The 6th Lichfield Cub pack   
meet at 6.30pm Monday nights. We do the
Grand Howl at the begining and the end 
of the meeting. We have groups called  
sixes, which are named after colours.  
We play games, and do different badge  
work every month. We go on camps as    
well. Recently a group for younger boys
has been started called Beavers. There 
are 45 Cubscouts.                      
     The Brownies also meet on Monday  
nights. We are called the 4th          
Lichfield pack. Our groups are also    
called sixes but we are called Kelpies 
 Leprechauns, Gnomes and Pixies. Our   
leaders are Brown Owl, Barn Owl and    
Snowy Owl. We like playing games and   
working for our badges. There are 28   
Brownies.
