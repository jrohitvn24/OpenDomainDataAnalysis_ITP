		<content> The numbers of people that come to the
 services vary with the seasons. In the
 summer holidaymakers come to the      
 church increasing the size of the     
 congregation.                         
 Mr. Boultbee became a vicar after he  
 found that he was becoming very active
 in the church and he had to make a    
 choice between his business and the   
 church.He approached the Bishop and   
 then attended a church college for 3  
 years.                                
 He has some hobbies, for which he has 
 little time.They are sailing and stamp
 collecting. The sailing he likes best 
 of all.                               
 The church in St .Merryn was founded  
 in 1422 A.D. and MR.Boultbee is very  
 proud of it.
