		<content>    Edmund Robert Harris died in 1877  
 leaving Â£300,000 for development in   
 Preston. His trust left in 1880       
 financed The Harris Institute which   
 became an art college and is now part 
 of the Lancashire Polythecnic and the 
 Harris building containing a free     
 library, art gallery and museum,which 
 is situated in Preston town centre.   
 The Harris Orphanage, situated along  
 Garstang Road in Fulwood, has now been
 bought by the Lancashire Polythecnic  
 to house students. The art gallery was
 built between 1882 and 1893 in memory 
 of his father, Reverand Robert Harris.
 Â£40,000 was donated to his institute, 
 dedicated to science and art. It was  
 set up to promote a " diffusion of    
 useful knowledge".
