		<title>05Lound Horse Show</title>
		<content> Lound Horse Show takes place each year
 on a Sunday in July.  It has been     
 running for ten years.  It has been   
 held in three different fields.  This 
 year it is in Mr. Powell's field.     
 There are twenty-seven events.  There 
 are showing events, jumping events and
 gymkhana games.  About one thousand   
 schedules are printed.  Three hundred 
 horses and ponies come to the show.  A
 lot of them come in horse boxes.      
 People come every year from far away. 
 There is a blacksmith in case one of  
 the horses loses a shoe.  There is a  
 saddlery stall and people from the    
 Women's Institute serve refreshments. 
 They also have a display of farming   
 bygones.  The show starts at 9.45     
 a.m. and finishes at 8.OO p.m.  At the
 end of the day the horses are all very
 tired.
