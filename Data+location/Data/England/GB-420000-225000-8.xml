		<content>  Hillside Farm, Oddington, is a fruit 
 and vegetable farm with some cereals  
 in rotation. There is a farm shop and 
 'Pick Your Own' trade in soft fruit.  
 Polythene tunnels are used for        
 tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and      
 beans. Small tunnels are used over    
 early crops of strawberries, a very   
 profitable fruit. The crops can be    
 irrigated from a stream. A busy main  
 road runs through the farm and the    
 danger of moving cattle across it is  
 the reason the fruit farm was begun 30
 years ago. The road brings a good     
 number of customers. A total of 44    
 hectares are farmed.
