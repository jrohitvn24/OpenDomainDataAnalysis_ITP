 car sales and one van rental. There   
 are 6{shopping areas, Clipsley Lane}  
 (33 shops with our only bank which is 
 open twice a week) and{West End Road} 
 (21 shops), which are the oldest areas
 (about 100 years), where the shops    
 have been made in the front rooms of  
 houses, and are spread along the      
 lengths of the roads.{Blackbrook Road}
 (7 shops) is a purpose-built parade   
 about 80 years old. The remaining
