    Most of the houses in these        
 villages are privately owned, though a
 small factor are council properties.  
 Some of the occupants live in farm    
 houses, an example of which is Manor  
 House and Farm. This farm covers      
 197.060 acres. This is made up of     
 arable land, pasture and a dairy.The  
 property in question has Farm, River, 
 Brick and Thatched Buildings. The     
 Manor House itself contains many rooms
 and extensive lawn gardens.           
    Adjacent to this 17th century      
 property is a magnificent old church  
 which is surrounded by a large        
 graveyard. The population of the two  
 villages have the opportunity to      
 attend a weekly service in this       
 ancient building.
