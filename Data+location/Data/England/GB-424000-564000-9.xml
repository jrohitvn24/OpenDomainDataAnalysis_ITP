		<title>09Newcastle Cen. Restoration</title>
		<content>    The conservation of buildings of   
 historic importance is a major factor 
 in the city of Newcastle's attempt to 
 create a city centre community in     
 which people will want to live, work  
 and visit.                            
   {Blackfriars,}being one of the most 
 complete{Dominican}priories surviving 
 in England, has an important role to  
 play in revitalising the city centre. 
 It is being restored as the centre    
 piece of an in-town village and houses
 craft workshops, a restaurant and     
 a tourist information centre. The city
{walls}on the fringe of the area add to
 its tourist interest.                 
    Cleaning of buildings in the famous
{Grey Street and Grainger Street}has   
 improved the appearance of the city   
 centre as has also the making of      
 pedestrian precincts when the{Eldon   
{Square}redevelopment took place.      </content>
