		<title>14Farming - Grass Management</title>
		<content>   Each year we re-seed between 6 and 8
 acres of our grassland in order to    
 maintain a good sward for grazing,    
 haymaking and silage. In late Spring  
 the fields which have been left       
 ungrazed contain matured grass which  
 is cut, dried, baled and put into     
 store for use as Winter feed. These   
 fields are then given a spreading of  
 nitrogen based fertiliser and later   
 sprayed with weedkiller in order to   
 produce a second crop of grass which  
 this time is cut and made into silage 
 whilst it still contains a high water 
 content. It is at this time that we   
 need extra help on the farm and two of
 the{sons of our neighbouring farmer}at
{Gayles Hall, Andrew and Kevin Stanwix,
 come to our aid. The grass is cut and 
 chopped by a forage harvester and     
 delivered to the silage clamp by      
 trailer. This forms Winter feed too.  </content>
