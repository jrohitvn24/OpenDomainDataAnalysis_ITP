		<title>07HISTORY OF WOOKEY HOLE</title>
		<content> ALTHOUGH A FEW HOUSES IN WOOKEY HOLE  
 DATE BACK SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS, THE  
 GREATER PART OF THE VILLAGE WAS BUILT 
 BY A W.S.HODGKINSON, WHO BOUGHT THE   
 PAPER MILL IN 1848. HE AND HIS SON    
 BUILT HOUSES FOR THE MILL WORKERS,A   
 SCHOOL,ANGLICAN CHURCH,AND A SOCIAL   
 CLUB FOR THE VILLAGE.                 
    THEY APPEAR TO HAVE TAKEN A        
 PATERNALISTIC INTEREST IN VILLAGE     
 LIFE. SCHOOL SPORTS AND TREATS WERE   
 HELD IN THE GROUNDS OF THEIR HOME,    
 WHERE THE VILLAGERS WERE ALSO ALLOWED 
 TO PLAY CRICKET.                      
   THE FAMILY OWNED THE PAPER MILL     
 UNTIL 1951, AND PAPER CONTINUED TO BE 
 MADE THERE UNTIL 1972, WHEN IT CEASED 
 AS A COMMERCIAL OPERATION, ALTHOUGH   
 HAND-MADE PAPER IS STILL PRODUCED ON A
 SMALL SCALE,MAINLY AS A TOURIST       
 ATTRACTION.                           
                                       </content>
