 There are church services all week.   
 The earliest is on Tuesday at 7.30am. 
 After some services you can have      
 coffee.  Probably the best attended   
 service is the Sunday l0.00am service.
  About 1-2% of the community attend   
 the church.  The church has three     
 choirs.  The main choir, the boys and 
 the ladies choir.  Practises are on   
 Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights.  
 Christ Church has 10 bells unlike most
 churches which have 8.  Christ Church 
 was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert     
 Scott.
