		<content> Woodlarks is situated between Lodge   
 Hill Road and Tilford Road. It is in  
 two parts The Woodlarks Campsite and  
 The Woodlarks Workshops.Both were     
 founded by Lt. Col.&amp; Mrs Strover.     
 The campsite covers 12 acres of pine  
 woods and grassland and here groups of
 physically handicapped people come to 
 enjoy a weeks holiday from mid May to 
 mid September.Groups come from all    
 over this country and some from       
 abroad. Each group brings its own camp
 leader and helpers.The majority sleep 
 in tents,but there is a dormitory     
 available.Meals are usually cooked on 
 an open wood fire and eaten outside.  
  There is a specially designed heated 
 swimming pool which is always popular.
 Adjoining the site is Woodlarks       
 Workshops which accomodates and offers
 work to 18 handicapped women.They make
 toys,etc. which are sold in the shop. </content>
