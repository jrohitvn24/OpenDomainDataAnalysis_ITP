		<content>  Opened in 1970, the swimming pool was
 largely financed by the local people  
 as a war memorial.                    
  The swimming area is a pool twenty-  
 five metres long, sloping to a depth  
 of ten feet to allow diving from a low
 board.  Beginners use a warmer shallow
 pool.                                 
  Today, the Recreation Centre includes
 four squash courts, two tennis courts 
 and a sixteen-station multi-gym. A    
 sports hall for badminton is planned. 
  Ten swimming instructors teach twenty
 -five schools every week, with other  
 classes for all ages,toddlers to      
 senior-citizens and special lessons   
 for the physically-handicapped. Coach-
 ing is given in squash and tennis and,
 in the school holidays, many other    
 activities are arranged.
