		<content>  No doctors now live in our block.    
 Nearly everyone goes to a doctor in{  
{Cirencester}where there are 4         
 practices to choose from. The hospital
 in{Cirencester}does major surgery but 
 no intensive care. Maternity cases go 
 to{Swindon}or{Cheltenham.}The nearest 
 chemist is in{Cirencester}which makes 
 getting prescriptions difficult for   
 those without cars. The Health Visitor
 visits the school regularly. The      
 school doctor and dentist visit each  
 year. Most children happily go to     
 their own dentist. The area has few   
 health hazards but a growing number   
 are concerned with farm sprays and    
 fumes from American aeroplanes. People
 are starting again to grow their own  
 vegetables because they think them    
 healthier. Over-indulgence in alcohol 
 has caused 2 or 3 deaths and some     
 illnesses recently.                   </content>
