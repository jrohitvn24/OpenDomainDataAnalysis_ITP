		<content> The scouts were formed in England by  
 Lord Baden-Powell for boys to set a   
 good example to the human race,respect
 the countryside,influence their       
 instincts to out-door life and to     
 develop a good character.Part of this 
training is to wear a uniform.         
 These boys have weekly  meetings in   
their hut which is usually borrowed.   
Scout groups are divided into patrols  
with different names,tending to be of  
animals but their is only one flag     
representing their town or village.    
The scouts are accustomed to singing   
together in the evenings to boost      
their morale.This is commonly done     
when the scouts go camping in tents at 
week-ends.The scouts usually have      
out-door games to get accustomed to    
the countryside and to get to know     
their surroundings and how to survive.
