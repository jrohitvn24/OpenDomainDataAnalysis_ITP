		<title>17BAPCHILD SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Bapchild School is a Group 4 school 
 that mainly draws its pupils from the 
 villages of Bapchild and Tonge. A few 
 children travel daily from more       
 distant areas. The school is a Church 
 Aided school with a strong association
 with the Church of St. Laurence, the  
 Church of England church in Bapchild. 
 The age range of the pupils at the    
 school is from 5 years to 11 years.   
 There are six classes and at present  
 there are 178 children. The school,   
 headed by Mr. D. Bowman, has a staff  
 of six full-time teachers. The        
 curriculum is wide ranging and incorp-
 orates visits to many venues. The     
 school hall is used for many events,  
 both by the school and  outside       
 organisations. The school was recently
 extended to accommodate the rise in   
 the number of children on roll.
