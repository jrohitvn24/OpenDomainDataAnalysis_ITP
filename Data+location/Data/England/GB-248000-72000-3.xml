		<content>  The{delicatessen}of "Creber's" opened
 in 1881.Little has been changed since 
 then.Originally it was only one shop, 
 but recently it has expanded.Creber's 
 has been a{family business}for several
 generations.Nowadays Creber's is well 
 known, even to the extent of supplying
 regular orders to Malta, Australia and
 America.It is particularly famed for  
 coffee,cheese and wine.The reason that
 Creber's is succesful is its friendly 
 service and the quality of food       
 provided.

      A new {supermarket }is being     
 constructed. Our survey found a       
 majority of residents against this as 
 there are five supermarkets already.  
      The new supermarket is badly     
 sited and could prove hazardous to    
 traffic until such time as the        
 Tavistock by-pass decision is reached.</content>
