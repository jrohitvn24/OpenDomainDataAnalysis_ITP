		<title>10LIKES AND DISLIKES IN FLEET</title>
		<content>{What I like}in Fleet is the fresh air 
 and the peace and quiet. It's         
 convenient to have a station in Fleet 
 so you can get to London quickly. I   
 like all the parks; in Fleet we have  
 three. The Views is pleasant and quiet
 so you can go for a walk without being
 disturbed. I like the{range of shops  
 that include almost every sort of shop
 except a large departmental store.    
                                       
{What I dislike}is that Fleet does not 
 have enough sports' facilities and    
 there are too many trees. The worst   
 omission is that there is no swimming 
 pool. I do not like the new Council   
 Offices being built on The Views. My  
 final dislike is the traffic; I think 
 there should be a pedestrian precinct.
 More{public transport}is also needed  
 at a cheaper price.
