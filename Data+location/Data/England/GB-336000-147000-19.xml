		<title>19Home Life in Mark</title>
		<content> I live in a village called{Mark.}When 
 I need to go to the shop, I have to go
 on my bicycle because it is about 1.5 
 miles away. I spend a lot of time in  
 the shop because it sells everything- 
 books,food,toys,sweets,make-up and    
 fruit. On my way home I pass the local
 pub. Sometimes I go into the          
 children's room with my friends or    
 play skittles while our parents have a
 drink. Most days when I get home from 
 school, if it is hot, my friends and I
 go swimming. I go to my Gran's every  
 day because she only lives next door. 
 I have 2 rabbits and 2 gerbils which I
 feed twice a day. I enjoy cycling     
 around Mark,it is lovely. Our class   
 from school went on a 6 mile cycle    
 ride around Mark to survey it. We     
 visited the Vicar and he showed us    
 round the Church and Vicarage. We saw 
 people selling fruit,flowers &amp; vegs.  </content>
