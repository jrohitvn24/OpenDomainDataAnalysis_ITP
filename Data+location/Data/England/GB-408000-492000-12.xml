  I sometimes lie in till 10.00 a.m so 
 does all my family.I let my cat in and
 take her up stairs so she can sleep   
 with me.Then I get my breakfast and   
 then I get washed and dressed then I  
 go out on my bike with my friends.I   
 have to come in for my dinner at 2.00 
 p.m.When my dad comes home from the   
 pub we start dinner.But sometimes I   
 have to give dinner to Mr Russell.Then
 my dad has a sleep in front of the    
 fire.                                 
            {Helen                     
 I get up at 8 o/clock and get dressed 
 and have breakfast and get a wash and 
 then play with Victoria and Joanne.   
 Sometimes I help mum make dinner.     
 After dinner I help to wash up and    
 then go to Sunday school. At Sunday   
 School we sing songs and play games   
 and draw pictures from Bible stories. </content>
