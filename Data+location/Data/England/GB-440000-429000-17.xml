		<content> What was the old cinema is now the    
 bingo hall sited on the High Street.  
 After work the men would go for a pint
 of beer, for atleast 2d, at one of    
 several pubs in Kippax. Eleven pubs   
 can be remembered by local people,    
 plus beer houses. Children played with
 dolls there were street games like    
 Kick the can, Hide and seek, and      
 spinning tops. Holiday tended to be   
 day trips to places like Morcombe,    
 perhaps twice a year.                 
 For holidays people often visited     
 their freinds. In boarding houses,    
 holidays could be made cheaper if you 
 provided your own fasciiities, ie     
 bedding and food. Most holidays taken 
 were for only half a day. Christmas   
 was looked  forward  to for a two day 
 break. Children toured the village    
 carol singing for half pennies.
