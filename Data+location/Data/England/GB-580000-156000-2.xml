		<title>02A FARMER'S DAY AUGUST 1985</title>
		<content> Combining is well advanced after a    
 late start due to a record-breaking,  
 wet summer. The oilseed rape and      
 barley crops are already in with good 
 yields. Wheat and pea crops are still 
 to be harvested. The day begins at    
 6.30am. with breakfast. Combining     
 continues all day; lunch and tea being
 taken in the fields. The farmer's wife
 deals with the animals. 300 ewes are  
 run through a Formalin foot bath and  
 some are also treated for Orf virus.  
 Some ewes to be sold are separated.   
 The two Suffolk rams will be turned   
 out with the remainder with a view to 
 starting lambing in February. The     
 horses and dogs are exercised, the    
 stables mucked out and the horses and 
 chickens are fed and the eggs         
 collected. The day finishes at 11pm.  
 with supper in the farmhouse.
