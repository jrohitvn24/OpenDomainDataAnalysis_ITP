		<title>04BOUNDARIES</title>
		<content> There were 117 fields or part fields  
 in our block. We looked at boundaries 
 on half these.When counting we counted
 each boundary as belonging to a       
 separate field so each was counted    
 twice if it bounded 2 fields.{Walls } 
 69 dry stone walls (made of local     
 stones laid on top of each other with 
 no bonding material).State of repair  
 varied &amp; many had shrubby growth or   
 trees alongside.{Hedges }5.Hedges were
 hawthorn, elder,blackthorn,sometimes  
 trimmed mechanically if at all. If    
 layered it was only once early in life
 of hedge.{Wire}11, much in poor       
 repair. Wire was netting or barbed    
 wire attached to fence posts. {Wooden 
{rails}approximately 6 all used in     
 connection with grazing horses.
