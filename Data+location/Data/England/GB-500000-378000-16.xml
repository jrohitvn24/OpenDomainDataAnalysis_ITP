		<title>16DUNHOLME STREET NAMES</title>
		<content> In the 1960's Mr. Terence Leach, a    
 local historian, was asked if he could
 suggest street names for the modern   
 housing developments beginning to take
 place in Dunholme. He suggested that  
 they were called after earlier        
 inhabitants of the village and so     
 Merleswyn is named after an           
 Anglo-saxon sherrif who survived the  
 Norman Conquest. Paynell was also an  
 Anglo-saxon landowner. Grantham,      
 Kneeland and Anderson were 17C.       
 landowners. Mainwaring and Hewson were
 I8c. landowners and Allwood and Swan  
 19C. landowners. Deane Walk is named  
 after Dr. Deane who lived and held his
 surgeries until the early 1960's at   
 his house which is now the Four       
 Seasons restaurent.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
