  Just over half a mile from Maldon    
 Quay up river are a flour mill,timber 
 merchants and salt works.The river is 
 deep enough to carry grain ships.Next 
 to the Quay is a large park known as  
 the Prom locally(the Promenade).It be-
 came a favourite seaside resort in    
 Victorian times.It has extensive play-
 ing fields,amusements,riverside walk, 
 outdoor swimming pool,boating lake and
 stalls.In August the carnival finishes
 there and at the end of the evening is
 a spectacular firework display around 
 and across the swimming pool.Here at  
 Christmas time many people come to    
 watch the Mud Races.Competitors wear  
 fancy dress and when the tide is out  
 they race across the river onto some  
 mud banks and back across to the Mal- 
 don side.It is often done in freezing 
 temperatures.                         </content>
