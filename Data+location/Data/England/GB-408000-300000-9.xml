A few cottages were in existence around
the junction of Roman Road and Forge   
Lane in about 1690,a few parts of these
remain today.  Little Aston Hall, built
originally in the sixteenth century,   
was replaced by the modern Hall in the 
eighteenth century;  this Hall has     
recently been converted into luxury    
flats.                                 
                                       
The other houses in the area are mainly
twentieth century, there is a complete 
range of all types of housing from     
council houses to luxury residences.   
On the Staffordshire side the remaining
land is green belt and is being        
preserved as such, but almost all the  
open spaces on the Four Oaks side have 
been, or will soon be, covered with    
housing estates.
