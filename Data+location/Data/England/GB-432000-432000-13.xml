		<title>13Myself in ten years (cont)</title>
		<content>    I think that a lot of things will  
 have changed in ten years time.       
 People won't use money very much, they
 willl use credit cards mainly.        
 Fashions will be very different as    
 well.   I hope we will have a car then
 we could use it to take our children  
 to different places.   We could also  
 drive to see my parents and stay with 
 them for a day.   I would give my     
 children pocket money but they would  
 have to save some of it in the bank.  
 They could use the money for their    
 holidays or when they wanted to buy   
 something expensive.   I will be      
 nineteen years old in ten years time.
