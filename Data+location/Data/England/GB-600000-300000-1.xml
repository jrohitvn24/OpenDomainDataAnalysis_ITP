		<content> The flat arable landscape is broken by
 a shallow west to east valley running 
 down to Seamere. Away from the town   
 many fields are very large. Boundaries
 are often only ditches. There are few 
 woods or individual trees. The small  
 town (population 1900) lies on higher 
 ground to the north and has a centre  
 of old, many Georgian, houses around  
 two greens and a large                
 fourteenth-century church, with modern
