<title>21Teenage life in Midhurst 2011</title>
<content>There are a few bars and pubs in Midhurst where young people can drink and socialise. BJ's and the seven fishes are 2 well known bars, the bus route 60 also comes to Midhurst from Chichester and often we catch the bus to go out in Chichester and on to Chichester's only nightclub "Thursdays" but the bus service stops at around 11pm so we must catch a taxi back or get a lift from a friend after we have finished partying if we are out later than 11pm.&lt;br />&lt;br />Although there are nice shops and places to eat in Midhurst and a local "Tesco express" most young people travel to Chichester for things to do as there are a wider range of shops there and a leasure complex called"Chichester gate" which contains a cinema and bowling alley. &lt;br />&lt;br />There are a few recrational parks and "hang out spots" in Midhurst but there is not much to do there during the day.&lt;br />
