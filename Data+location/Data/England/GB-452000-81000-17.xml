		<title>17BIOGRAPHY - DANIEL'S MORNING</title>
		<content> At 7.45 I got up and made my          
 breakfast. It is called Ready Brek and
 is an oat cereal you pour hot milk on.
 Then I put on my school uniform, grey 
 trousers and pullover, white shirt and
 purple tie and went to Godshill       
 Primary School. After Assembly when we
 have had a story and a hymn and said a
 prayer, we did Maths. At playtime I   
 had my carton of milk (Not everyone   
 has this, but I am not very big yet,  
 so I do.) Then I went by school bus to
 the Swimming Pool at Medina High      
 School in Newport. The instructor says
 I'm quite good but I need more        
 confidence. Back at school I had sand-
 wiches for my dinner - white bread    
 with luncheon meat. My friends who had
 school dinner had curry with rice and 
 peas and carrots, then raspberry buns 
 and milkshake. After dinner we all    
 went out to play on the playground.   </content>
