		<title>16The Strand, Gillingham</title>
		<content> "Lets all go down the Strand".  This  
 is a line made famous in an old song. 
 People and children in Gillingham love
 going to the Strand because there are 
 lots of things to do.  The activities 
 don't cost much and the park and the  
 paddling pool are free.  These are the
 activities you can enjoy; in the park 
 you can swim, ride on the miniature   
 railway, play crazy golf and proper   
 golf, cruise in paddle boats, play    
 tennis.  There is also a playground   
 with swings and slides.  Some people  
 just like to sunbathe,  or paddle in  
 the river Medway.  Whatever you choose
 to do, The Strand is a very attractive
 place.
