		<title>14OLD JOHN MONUMENT.</title>
		<content> On a hill in Bradgate Park, near      
 Anstey there is a tower Known as{Old  
{John}.This is the story of this       
 strange building.                     
 Once lots of park keepers and farmers 
 decided to have a party on the hill.  
 They had a big pole in the middle with
 oil around it with fire up the pole.  
 Nearly all the men were drunk, because
 of this they did not notice the pole  
 falling. Suddenly it fell, hitting a  
 man called{John}. The men were so     
 upset about the accident that they    
 built a tower and named it{OLD JOHN}. 
 They built an arch at the side to make
 it look like a beer jug because John  
 liked his beer very,very much.
