		<title>12The Merger of BCHE AND BAA</title>
		<content>      One of the major issues of the   
 day  is the Merger of Bath College of 
 Higher Education and Bath Academy of  
 Art.  BCHE is based at Newton Park but
 also has sites at Sion Hill and       
 Somerset Place (both in Bath).  Bath  
 Academy of Art has sites in Corsham   
 (near Bath) and Sydney Place (Bath).  
 The Merger is a measure taken by the  
 government to keep the administrative 
 costs low.  A lot of people do not    
 like the idea, but the alternative    
 could be the closure of all the       
 colleges.                             
      The Art students are losing the  
 Corsham site and moving to Sion Hill. 
 The Sion Hill students are moving to  
 Newton Park.                          
      Thus in our survey we found a lot
 of new building work to accommodate   
 the new students at Newton Park.
