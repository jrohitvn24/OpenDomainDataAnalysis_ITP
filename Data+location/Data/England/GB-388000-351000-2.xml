		<title>02Houses in the Norton region.</title>
		<content>The oldest houses in the area are built
out of the local stone, much of which  
was quarried from Brown Edge.Brown     
Edge village itself has many fine stone
buildings. A number of stone farmhouses
date from the seventeenth century, or  
if you listen to their owners much     
earlier. Brick buildings of the        
eighteenth and early nineteenth century
can be seen in Norton village showing  
where the early settlement started. By 
the later nineteenth century terraced  
houses were being built for the miners 
working in the local mines. Rows of    
these can be seen in Ball Green.By the 
beginning of the twentieth century     
large numbers of terraced houses were  
being built in Stockton Brook, Milton  
and Ball Green.In the inter war period 
the Ball Green estate of brick semis   
was erected and this was followed by   
the Norton estate which is post war.   </content>
