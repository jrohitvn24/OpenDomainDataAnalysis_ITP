		<content> The event of the year is the Summer   
 Fete and Flower Show held on the last 
 Saturday in July on the Pestalozzi    
 Field. All local groups take part and 
 many provide a float for a procession 
 through the village. This is headed by
 the Flower Princess.                  
 Various other fetes are held by       
 different clubs at other times on the 
 Village Green. Morris dancers visit   
 twice a year.                         
 The School traditionally holds a      
 Christmas Market on the first Saturday
 in December, and a Strawberry Fair in 
 the Summer.                           
 The Pestalozzi Village has an annual  
 open day.                             
 There are Spring and Autumn           
 Horticultural Shows.                  
 A Stoolball Tournament attracts other 
 village teams every year.
