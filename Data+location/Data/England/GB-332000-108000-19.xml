		<title>19CHARD 750</title>
		<content>  This year, Chard celebrates its 750th
 year as a town, a charter having been 
 signed by Bishop Jocelyn in 1235.     
  To mark this occasion, many events   
 have been staged, such as a{torchlight
{procession}from the toll-house above  
 Chard to the Guildhall. About 2000    
 people took part and 750 torches      
 carried. This was followed by a       
 firework display. A{community play    
 also took place and was extremely     
 successful, being written by two local
 residents. The community project was  
 to build a{swimming pool,}and many    
 fund raising activities occured- even 
 the 'Radio 1 Roadshow' being broadcast
 nearby. The pool was opened on 11 June
 1985 by{HRH Princess Anne-}the first  
 royal visitor since King Charles II ! 
  Many other shows, competitions,      
 concerts, open days and the special   
 carnival have been organised.         </content>
