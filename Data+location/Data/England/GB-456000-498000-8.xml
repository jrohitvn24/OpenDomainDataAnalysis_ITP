		<content>  The bells at Saint Hilda's church    
 Bilsdale are 650 years old and there  
 are two of them.                      
 Saint Hilda's bells were made by Mr   
 Walters of Lund near Malton.The bells 
 were made in Saint Hilda's church     
 yard.There are two bells. Written on  
 the bells is Ave Maria Mater which    
 means , Greetings Mary Mother.The     
 bells are made of bell metal which is 
 mainly copper and tin .The bells were 
 last rung in 1983 by Mr M Richardson  
 .The bells are now at Taylors of      
 Loughbrough being refurbished after   
 all the wear that they have had over  
 the years . When the bells come back  
 they will be blessed by the Bishop of 
 Whitby and then re-hung by Mr. David  
 Wray a builder who lives in Chopgate  
 and who repaired the collapsed church 
 roof in 1985.
