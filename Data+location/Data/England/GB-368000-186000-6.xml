{On Saturday,}I get up at 9.00, get    
 dressed, go downstairs and have       
 breakfast. At 10.30, we go shopping   
 and come back at 12.00 for dinner.    
 After washing up, Mother does some    
 washing and puts it out to dry and    
 later gets it in and does the ironing.
 At 3.00, we go out for a walk and     
 later come in to watch a film on T.V. 
 After the film, we have tea and then  
 go jogging. At 7.30, I have a shower  
 and then watch T.V. I go to bed at    
 9.00.
