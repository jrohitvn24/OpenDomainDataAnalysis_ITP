		<content> about four, with a member of staff.   
 The rest of the students are sent     
 either to work on the farm or to help 
 cook lunch, or to help in the gardens.
 Because they do not have or want a    
 television, in the evening they amuse 
 themselves,either singing or playing  
 an instrument.                        
   Some of the students are worried by 
 anything out of the ordinary, so on   
 Monday evenings they have a meeting   
 where they explain what is happening  
 that week. They are not allowed pets  
 in the house, but there are two cats  
 on the farm. They keep cows, sheep and
 grow vegetables, so they are almost   
 self-sufficient.                      
   There is an Open Day, to raise money
 where things which the students have  
 made are sold.Once, the leather       
 workshop caught fire and the things   
 made for Open Day were burnt.         </content>
