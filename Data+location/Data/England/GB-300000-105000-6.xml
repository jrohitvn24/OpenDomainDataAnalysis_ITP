		<title>06CULLOMPTON POLICE</title>
		<content>   The police from the station cover   
 Cullompton and other villages.They    
 travel in Panda cars and work in      
 shifts.Some are community policemen   
 for specific villages.They have a     
 truncheon,handcuffs and radios.Their  
 main problems are teenagers with      
 eighteen year olds commiting most     
 offences,theft being a common         
 problem.As the population has         
 increased so has crime.If a prisoner  
 is brought in he is allowed to inform 
 someone by phoning and is then kept in
 the 3m*4m cell.As there are not enough
 officers to watch prisoners they do   
 not stay long.Some vandalism occurs in
 the cells.                            
   The police feel they do not solve   
 crimes today,but act more like the    
 fire_brigade.
