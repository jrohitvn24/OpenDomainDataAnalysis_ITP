		<title>12ELLAND BY-PASS</title>
		<content> The by-pass was built to keep traffic,
 which was using the main road between 
 Halifax and Huddersfield, away from   
 the town centre.  There had been      
 several road accidents as heavy goods 
 vehicles had run away down the hill   
 approaching the town and careered     
 through the town centre.  Luckily very
 few fatalities had occurred.          
 The by-pass provides a valuable link  
 with the M62 whilst keeping the town  
 centre free of through traffic.       
 Whereas this has been welcomed by many
 inhabitants, it has not been popular  
 with traders or shoppers.             
 One parade of shops which had been    
 alongside the old road and enjoyed a  
 fairly busy trade is now empty apart  
 from a hairdressers and a car         
 accessory and DIY store.
