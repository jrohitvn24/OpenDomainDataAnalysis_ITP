		<content>  Stanhope is the most vandalised area 
 in Weardale although vandalism is not 
 a great problem in Stanhope. A vast   
 majority of the population said that  
 if they witnessed an act of vandalism 
 they would report it to the police    
 whether they recognised the culprit or
 not. Scraping cars ,smashing windows  
 with air rifles ,damaging public      
 telephones and writing on walls are   
 the main acts of vandalism in         
 Stanhope. Not many people complain.   
 Old people mostly.                    
  3/4 think the 37.5p dog licence is   
 too low. 1/4 thought it was about     
 right.Everyone thought dogs should not
 be allowed to roam unattended. A vast 
 majority think dog owners should be   
 stopped from exercising their dogs in 
 children's playgrounds. Not many      
 people have a dog licence.
