		<content> Croft House Farm is on the main street
 of Ireby. It is stone built and is 216
 years old. The buildings consist of a 
 calf shed, three byres, a barn and a  
 dutch barn (both used for storing     
 hay) and 2 lofts also used for storing
 hay. There is a third loft which is   
 used for storing barley and a meal    
 house where we store the animals food.
 We also have an implement shed where  
 we keep all the implements that can't 
 be left out in the rain. The implement
 shed is situated on an acre or so of  
 land called a garth. This is where we 
 also keep our big bales. We have 80   
 sheep of various breeds. We also have 
 80 cows but we are only milking 23.We 
 have 16 calves all feeding from the   
 bucket. We have three tractors, all   
 Fords. We sell milk and vegetables.
