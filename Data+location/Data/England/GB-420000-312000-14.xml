		<title>14The Old School House contd.</title>
		<content>     The servants and animals would    
have lived in the rear of the house    
where the ceiling beams are of inferior
quality wood and are not champered.    
      Charring of the rafters above the
centre of the main hall show that the  
fire used to be in the middle of that  
room, but later improvements positioned
it at the side of the room.            
     It seems that modernisations were 
carried out in Tudor times when the    
floor was added to the hall. The main  
support timbers which carry the floor  
show indications of a previous use.    
Upstairs there are Tudor doorways to   
the bedrooms and missing curved        
wind-braces must have been removed     
during a more recent modernisation.One 
fascinating feature is a candle burn on
a beam beside one of the bedroom doors.
