		<content>  A modern farmer uses modern          
 technology instead of intensive labour
 as in the past. Machinery will do the 
 work of many men. A{COMBINE HARVESTER 
 costing at least Â£35,000 will probably
 only be in use for three weeks in a   
 year. It will be driven by one man, it
 will cut the corn, separate the grain 
 from the stalk on the field and when  
 it has ten tons it will unload onto a 
 trailer without stopping. The grain is
 taken to the farm where it is stored  
 using blowers and conveyors. If the   
 grain is damp, warm air is blown      
 through it. It is constantly moved    
 about to keep it fresh until it is    
 sold. This may be up to a year later. 
 Immediately after harvest more        
 machinery quickly cultivates the soil 
 and the farmer sprays weeds and sows  
 most of next years crops well before  
 the autumn is over.                   </content>
