		<content> St Mary's stands on a slight rise. The
 earliest part is the chancel dating   
 from Norman times. The tower, situated
 in the middle of the church, has an   
 octagonal staircase. Housed in the    
 tower is the clock &amp; 6 bells. In 1908 
 the bells with the exception of the   
 600 year old tenor were recast. 3 of  
 the chancel windows are Norman with   
 chevron moulding. Large windows above 
 the communion table depict the life of
 Christ. Under the communion table is  
 the gravestone of the Revd. Richard   
 Edmunds, rector who died in 1605 aged 
 82. The pulpit is oak, the font of    
 sculptured stone with a carved cover, 
 in memory of John Morris, church      
 warden 1868 to 1899. Fine corels      
 composed of clustered shafts with rich
 capitals still remain but the roof    
 they once supported has gone.
