		<content> 12,000 plants are grown under glass.  
 The yield is about 150 tons per acre. 
 Seeds are sown in November in a       
 growing room.Then they are pricked out
 into 3"pots.After 3 weeksthey are     
 placed on top of peat bags in the     
 greenhouses,and planted after 6 weeks.
 Each plant is drained up 30ft strings.
 As they grow the bottom leaves side   
 shoot dead trusses are taken off.When 
 they read the wire they are layered so
 that the stems end up trailing on the 
 ground.The first flowers appear in    
 January and they are pollinated daily 
 with an electric bee.Picking starts at
 the begining of March and finishes in 
 November when all the plants are      
 cleared and the greenhouse sterilised.
 The nursery is called the Paget       
 Nursery.
