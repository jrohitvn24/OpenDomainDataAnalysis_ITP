		<title>06ANIMAL LIFE</title>
		<content> The area is principally farmland, moor
 land and woodland all rich in animal  
 life.  All the more common wild       
 animals are seen. Rabbits are now     
 multiplying and can be seen during the
 day in fields &amp; in natural cover.     
 Hares are seen more often in the      
 Spring when courting. Hedgehogs are   
 unfortunately often the victims of car
 drivers, but whilst being slaughtered 
 in large numbers continue to survive. 
 Moles are evidenced by their "hills". 
 They are trapped by farmers because of
 the way they disrupt land. Stoats     
 and weasels feed on mice &amp; voles.     
 Foxes are a threat to smaller animals 
 and domestic fowl. These are shut away
 at night for their protection. Grey   
 squirrels have driven out their red   
 relatives. Roe deer can be seen on the
 edges of forests.
