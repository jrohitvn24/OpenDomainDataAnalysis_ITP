 Potatoes and sugar beet are lifted    
 by tractor drawn machines             
 beforeprior to grading, storing or    
 delivery to processing factories.     
 some potatoes are sold through        
 markets and shops to the housewife.   
 Cows are milked by electrically       
 powered machines, fed by computer     
 controlled dispensers and cleaned     
 out by tractors. Straw for bedding    
 is mechanically baled and handeled    
 as is the resulting farm yard manure. 
 The slurrey produced by intensivly    
 housed pigs is pumped and spread      
 onto the land
