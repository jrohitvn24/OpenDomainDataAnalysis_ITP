		<title>18VILLAGE HISTORY</title>
		<content> Newsham village which lies on the baks
 of the Tees was a long narrow         
 settlement and the largest of the     
 deserted medieval villages in         
 Cleveland. The village is first       
 recorded as a possession of the Baliol
 family,builders of Barnard Castle in  
 the 12th century,but an earlier       
 beggining is likely. A continuous     
 existence is recorded until the late  
 14th century when the population fell 
 from 25 households to one             
 household,probably because of the     
 Black Death.If you go to Newsham      
 Grange you will see the banks that    
 mark the cottage boundaries.
