		<title>06The Village Blacksmith</title>
		<content>  In tales of villages the {Blacksmith}
is often mentioned. Near to our school 
is a garage. The garage repairs cars,  
does MOT's and work for the farmers. It
once sold petrol but the pumps are now 
empty. The garage was once the Smithy, 
and the {forge}is still used but not to
shoe horses. The owner  makes parts for
vehicles or agricultural machines or   
pieces of decorative ironwork.         
  The present owner has lived in the   
village for all of his life and his    
father was the blacksmith before him.  
All the tools of this trade can be     
found in the garage today.             
  The forecourt of the garage is often 
used by the Girl Guides for carwashing.
