		<content> Railway lines from Louth inland to    
 Bardney closed in the early 1950's,   
 the ones to Mablethorpe on the coast  
 in the late 1950's.The main line to   
 Grimsby closed in 1970,the track being
 taken up in the early 1980's to be    
 used in the new Selby coalfield.      
 Builders want to demolish the last    
 remaining bridge to make room for     
 houses but some local people feel it  
 ought to be preserved.The Louth to    
 Grimsby line has been bought by the   
 Railway Preservation Society,as has   
 the Louth signal box.The station      
 building and surrounding substantial  
 property have been considered for many
 development projects.1985 has seen it 
 designated an industrial/commercial   
 development called Louth Station      
 Estates.The station is a listed       
 building and will hopefully be        
 tastefully conserved.                 </content>
