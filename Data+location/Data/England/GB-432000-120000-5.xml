		<title>05COUNTY COUNCILLOR FOR ROMSEY</title>
		<content> Mrs Liz Brett became the Hampshire    
 County Councillor of Romsey and Romsey
 extra when she won the election on 2nd
 May 1985.  The next election will be  
 held in 1989.  Now, after the         
 election, the Council is half Liberal 
 SDP Alliance and Labour and half      
 Conservative.  Mrs Brett hopes that   
 this change will make the Council more
 open.  Mrs Brett does not agree with  
 paying to park in Romsey because it   
 makes people park in residential      
 streets and not in the car parks.  She
 told me that to reduce unemployment   
 more maintenance jobs could be made   
 available, such as cleaning drains,   
 renewing roads etc.  In the future Mrs
 Brett thinks that the 3 main parties  
 in the Central Government will be more
 equally represented and that they will
 have to be more co-operative with each
 other.                                </content>
