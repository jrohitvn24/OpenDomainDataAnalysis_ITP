		<content>   The parish has always been entirely 
{agricultural.}The{population}before   
 the general bulge of the 19th. century
 averaging perhaps 300 - increasing by 
 1880 to over 800, then{declining}over 
 the next century to 300-350 where it  
 now stands. In the past most people   
 worked on the land but very few do    
 now. The 1971 Census indicated that   
 60% of the population were employed   
 and this includes a higher proportion 
 of working women than is usual in     
 rural areas. This is partly due to    
{company transport}provided to Sudbury,
 Glemsford, Great Yeldham, Hedingham,  
 Haverhill and Wratting and out working
 at home.                              
   In 1971 17% of the population were  
{retired persons}and this is           
 increasing. The number of young       
 children is decreasing.
