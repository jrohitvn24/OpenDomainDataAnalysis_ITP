		<content> Almost all householders have at least 
 one car. Motor bikes or mopeds are    
 frequent among young men and women,   
 and bicycles among school children.   
 There are minibuses for Shebbear and  
 Merton Primary Schools, and a bus for 
 Great Torrington School. Children walk
 or get lifts to pick up points both   
 forthat bus and the minibus to the    
 North Devon College, Barnstaple.      
 Private buses run to Shebbear College 
 and Edgehill College, Bideford. Shared
 transport is common for work with many
 having lifts. There are many social   
 outings and excursions by private hire
 coaches. Hills Services run a public  
 bus service via Shebbear              
 to Holsworthy, Bideford and Exeter.   
 All start at Stibb Cross and each     
 service is weekly. There is a twice   
 weekly service from Peters Marland  to
 Bideford and Barnstaple via Torrington</content>
