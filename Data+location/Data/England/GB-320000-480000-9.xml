		<content> There are, in fact, three churches    
 in the D-Block - the Parish church of 
 St. Cuthbert's, a Methodist church and
 a Pentecostal church. Although all    
 three are active, the Anglican church 
 is the largest. The main fabric of the
 building has been renovated and       
 altered through the years, but the    
 main doorway retains an excellent     
 Norman archway. Within the church     
 there is a small fragment of stained  
 glass which also dates from Norman    
 times, and is now incorporated in a   
 more recent window. Amongst other     
 interesting features are a Saxon      
 muniment chest made in one piece from 
 a section of tree-trunk, a Saxon      
 tomb-stone and a Norman font. The     
 belfry contains an excellent peal of  
 bells, some dating from the           
 seventeenth century.
