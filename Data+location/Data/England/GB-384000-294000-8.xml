		<content>   The name of Trysull church is All   
Saints.Our religion is Church of       
England.  It is very old. Some parts   
are from the 11th century. It is made  
of sandstone and has a tower with a    
weather cock. This tells which way the 
wind is blowing.There is a sundial and 
a clock that chimes every hour.The     
church has very thick walls.Nearly all 
of the stones look old but some of the 
North wall are new. There are two      
entrances. One is the South door and   
the other the West.This door is        
new.Two old carvings are on the arch.  
They look like a king and queen.There  
are some stained glass windows in the  
church. The oldest one was made over   
600 years ago.It is behind the         
altar.Over the vestry door is a        
carving of a bishop.You can see his    
mitre and crozier. It was carved in    
the 12th century.                      </content>
