		<content> The country side around Stratford is  
 peaceful and rolling.Much of it is    
 intensively farmed.We visited two     
 farms in our block,one very close to  
 Stratford and the other out in the    
 countryside. Hines House Farm: They   
 had 98.04 acres of land.They          
 specilised in arable food.They did not
 have any animals apart from a little  
 dog.They had alot of machinary because
 they specilised in cereals like oats, 
 corn and wheat.Hines House means      
 the home of the Monks retreat from the
 Abbey. Cross-O-The-Hill Farm: Cross-O-
 The-Hill Farm had one hundred and     
 forty acres of land.They specialise in
 vegetables.They have a helper on the  
 farm and when it is harvesting time   
 they could have up-to twenty helpers. 
 They kept twenty-five cattle for meat.
 They grow salad stuff and vegetables. 
 They also grow barley and wheat.      </content>
