		<content>   We went to visit St.Michael's Church
 Stanground.It is used for{Church of   
{England}services and for the{Roman    
{Catholic Mass.}                       
   It is a modern building and we      
 counted one hundred and sixty-five    
 chairs for people to sit on.We saw the
 different parts of the church.There   
 was a font where babies are baptized  
 and the organ and a gold cross.We     
 looked at the Pascal candle and the   
 robes that the priest wears for       
 Mass.The church has red carpets and a 
 curtain behind the altar.The walls are
 painted white.Outside the church are  
 lawns and flower beds and some trees.
