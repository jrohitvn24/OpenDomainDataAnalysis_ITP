		<title>07 The Village Pub</title>
		<content>                                       
The Montagu Arms is the only pub in    
Barnwell. It has a crazy golf course   
and a caravan site at the back together
with a playground. In the pub it has   
an open fire which is lit in the       
winter and they have a band that plays 
for them. The barman's name is Mike. I 
know Mr. and Mrs. Harley they are      
managing the pub while owners are      
abroad. The best selling drink is beer 
(71p per pint) and I sometimes go to   
the pub on Sundays with my parents,    
brother and sisters and have a drink   
and a packet of crisps. I like to play 
crazy golf which costs 130p but when   
you have finished you get your pound   
back. My favourite drink is lemonade   
called Panda Pop (15p) and a packet of 
crisps costs 12p.
