{TOUCH ONCE    }First you find a wall  
 about 4 metres long and 5 metres tall.
 you then pick a group of people and   
 number them 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th and so
 on. The first person throws the ball  
 and when the ball rebounds the second 
 person throws if a person misses they 
 are out.                              
                                       
{CHAINY  }  Choose a person to be it.  
 He/she chases someone and when they   
 have been caught they link hands and  
 chase another person. Once a chain o  
 four people has been formed this      
 splits up into two chains of two. When
 all but one have been caught then the 
 game is over and the remaining person 
 becomes the it for a new game.        
  You need a big space and lots of     
 children for this game.
