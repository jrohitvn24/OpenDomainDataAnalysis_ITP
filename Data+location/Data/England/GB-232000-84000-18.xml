		<title>18  TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Several years ago,a{by-pass}was built 
 on the{A.30}so that our town would be 
 less congested,especially at peak     
 holiday time.In spite of this,the town
 centre still has too much traffic when
 people are coming into or leaving     
 work.It has been suggested that the   
{square}should be a{pedestrian precinct
 with new one-way systems.On a Tuesday,
 market day,in July 1985,we stood by   
 the{new road lay-out}by the Town Hall 
 and between 9.30 a.m. and 10a.m. we   
 counted 490 vehicles from all routes. 
 Most of them were{market}traffic from 
 the North and West.The market is badly
 situated in the centre of town and    
 will shortly be moved to Pennygillam. 
 There are{bus stops}in Westgate Street
 which cause hold- ups when buses park 
 nearly opposite each other. On the    
 way to Holsworthy is a{new road bridge
 over the River Tamar at Netherbridge. </content>
