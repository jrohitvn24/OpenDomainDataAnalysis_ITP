		<title>15Dennis the bus-driver.</title>
		<content>   Dennis has been a bus driver for six
 years. He drives the buses 71, 73, 6, 
 7, X71, and X73 for Tyne and Wear     
 Passanger Transport Executive. There  
 are two shifts he can work on - the   
 early shift that starts at 4.15 am or 
 the later shift beginning at 3.30 pm. 
   To get the job of a bus driver you  
 must pass a test and an entrance      
 exam. You have to be 18 before you can
 be a bus driver. Dennis gets five     
 weeks holiday a year.                 
   The Metro train service has made a  
 differance to his job, he picks up    
 less people now at differant times.   
 The bus is like a feeder for the      
 Metro.                                
   Dennis likes meeting people on the  
 bus, he dislikes hazzardous traffic   
 and troublemakers. He would not like  
 to work on the metro because they just
 sit in the cabs alone all day.        </content>
