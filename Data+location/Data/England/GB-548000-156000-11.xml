		<title>11POLICE-DUNTON GREEN/OTFORD</title>
		<content> Our local Dunton Green policeman is   
 P.C. Thacker. His job is to walk round
 D.G., Riverhead &amp; Chipstead, mainly to
 protect life &amp; property. He's very    
 well known &amp; is always talking to     
 people about different things. He has 
 changing shifts to suit him, whether  
 it be night-times(10pm-6am) or a day  
 beat. When he's not walking round our 
 area he may be filling in at the      
 police station for men &amp; women away.  
 Sometimes he might go round in the car
 but he said he preferred walking as he
 can enjoy the countryside &amp; wildlife  
 as well as be on the lookout for      
 trouble-makers. He carries a truncheon
 but never seems to use it.            
 In Otford P.C.Tim Clements is making  
 an effort to become known locally.He  
 visits schools,writrs in the Parish   
 magazine &amp; advises on burglar         
 protection.                           </content>
