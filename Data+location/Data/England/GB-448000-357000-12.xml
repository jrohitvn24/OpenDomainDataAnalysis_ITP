{Three Days in Hospital.}On a Wednesday
 morning,I woke up and had pains.My Mum
 called the doctor and he said,"Go to  
 the hospital."I arrived at 11.20a.m.I 
 was in Blandy Ward.Several doctors    
 came to see me before the operation at
 4.00p.m.Next day I couldn't eat at all
 so I was hungry.I had my arm in a     
 sling,with a tube running from a bag  
 into my arm,which was feeding me.On   
 Friday,I was excited,my arm was free  
 at last.I read for a bit,the doctors  
 came and I went home.ANDREW SLACK.    </content>
