		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF SALPERTON</title>
		<content> Salperton,in the parish of Hazleton,is
 an isolated village in a shallow      
 valley between the A436 Andoversford  
 to Bourton road and the A40           
 Andoversford to Northleach road.It is 
 in a wooded area and is surrounded by 
 fields.There are 26 houses in the     
 village.Nearly all are of Cotswold    
 stone and several have been there for 
 two to three hundred years.They stand 
 on either side of the lane which winds
 through the village and of one other  
 lane which tails off into a public    
 footpath after going through a short  
 tunnel under the old railway          
 embankment.There are many attractive  
 gardens with a small stream running   
 through some of them.
