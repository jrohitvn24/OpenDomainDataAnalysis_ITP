		<title>12FIRE AT MILL FARM, WHALEY.</title>
		<content>      On February 14th. 1985 my home,  
 Mill Farm, Whaley, was burnt to a     
 cinder.It was the worst fire that I   
 had ever seen. The Firemen came with  
 four engines and two of them were     
 frozen up.                            
      My family and I were out when the
 fire began. The firemen 'phoned Mum at
 a friend's house and told her about   
 it. They thought it must be a joke at 
 first, that is until they got home.   
 When we saw the damage my mum cried   
 and my dad was stunned.               
      Now Mill Farm is being rebuilt as
 another little cottage.
