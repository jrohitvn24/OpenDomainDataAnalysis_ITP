		<content>  This is a rural area which comprises 
 mainly of farm land. The land is used 
 for the rearing of beef cattle and    
 sheep, and for the growing of silage. 
 The river Nidd runs through the valley
 which is formed by gentle hills. On   
 the east bank is the small market town
 of Pateley Bridge and on the opposite 
 bank is the attractive village of     
 Bridgehousegate. There is a very      
 interesting selection of footpaths and
 a variety of woodland. There are      
 several old quarries and springs      
 scattered throughout the area. Most   
 buildings here are constructed from   
 local stone.
