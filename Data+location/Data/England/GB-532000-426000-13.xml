		<title>13PRINTING THE NEWS,WITHERNSEA</title>
		<content>  News for the local paper,the         
 Holderness Gazette,is obtained in     
 various ways.People telephone or call 
 in at the office.Sometimes other daily
 papers might be consulted for         
 items.Stories are edited and          
 investigated before being sent for    
 printing.Requests for adverts from    
 businessmen or private people must be 
 received by Tuesday for inclusion in  
 Thursday's paper.When items are ready 
 for printing they are sent to the     
 printers, a small firm, serving the   
 whole area.They have only 6 staff     
 very modern equipment.News is typed   
 onto a word processor and together    
 with the ads, columns are pieced      
 together to fill the pages.Photographs
 are copied on a special camera which  
 can decrease or increase size.The     
 paper was first published in 1960 but 
 is now tremendously increased in size.</content>
