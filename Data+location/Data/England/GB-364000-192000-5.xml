		<title>05 YEW TREE FARM,NEWTON.</title>
		<content>  Yew Tree Farm,Newton is run by Mr and
Mrs Cullimore. The position of the     
farm,ten feet above sea level,and close
to the river Severn,forces the farmer  
to produce beef,milk and lamb.He has   
130 cows and a few of them are for     
meat.He has 160 ewes and a ram,all used
for producing lamb and mutton. The farm
covers an area of 300 acres and only 60
acres are used for arable farming.     
  The only recent changes were caused  
by EEC quotas which made the farmer cut
down on cows.                          
  The only helpers on the farm are     
himself,his wife,a full time and a part
time employee.Four workers in all.His  
farm is one of 5 tenant farms and he   
gets his heavy machinery on            
contract,but has four tractors,3 normal
ones and one known as a                
"foreloader".This allows the farmer to 
attach machinery to the front of it,   </content>
