		<content>   75% of the area is given over to    
Farming - this is good agricultural    
land. The New Town was built on the    
only poor quality land in the area.    
   Mixed Farming was traditional making
the local communities self sufficient  
providing grain, vegetables, meat,     
poultry, dairy produce for themselves  
and the townships of Wigan, St.Helens  
and Ormskirk.                          
   The farms employed many people but  
mainly on a seasonal basis. Everyone   
in the local community worked on the   
farms at harvest time and upto quite   
recently the Village Schools were      
closed for 2 weeks in October for the  
'Potato Picking Holiday'. This produced
a strong sense of community.           
   The advent of the tractor and other 
machinery brought less reliance on the 
community and the emerging food        
industry changed the pattern of farming</content>
