		<content> "My mum is an auxillary nurse at a    
 cottage hospital. My dad works at a   
 school for handicapped, or disturbed  
 children. My mum sometimes sleeps     
 during the day after having a night at
 work. She also teaches cake decorating
 at college. My sister and I sometimes 
 go to the Green to play in an old     
 tree, we have great fun. In Summer, I 
 go on bike rides with my dad and      
 sister.I play several musical         
 instruments and I go to Ballet and    
 Brownies. I have a pet cat called     
 Tipsy."                               
 "My mum is a housewife, my dad is a   
 farmer. He has 14000 chickens, 50 cows
 and 36 calves. I have two brothers and
 one sister. My best sports are Tennis 
 and Football. I go to cubs once a week
 and I am a "sixer." Two weeks ago we  
 went to camp and the best thing about 
 it was cooking our own meals."        </content>
