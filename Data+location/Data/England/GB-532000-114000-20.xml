		<title>20Handicapped at Westmeston</title>
		<content>  This Georgian house formerly a       
 private residence, is run as a joint  
 residential and day care centre for   
 mentally handicapped people. Its      
 correct title is the Westmeston Rural 
 Training Centre but everyone locally  
 knows it as Middleton Manor. The aim  
 is not necessarily to train horticult_
 urists but to help mentally           
 handicapped people look forward to the
 future with self confidence,with      
 desirable work skills and with a      
 realistic view of themselves. They are
 entitled to the same respect and      
 position in society as so called      
 normal people, and every effort is    
 made to explode the stigma attached to
 mental handicap and to help the local 
 community to accept the students with_
 out prejudice. The staff champion the 
 right to life, to love, to work and to
 leisure.                              </content>
