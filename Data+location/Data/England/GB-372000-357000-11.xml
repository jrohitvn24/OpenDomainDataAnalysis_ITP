		<content>  Mr Elliott said they could play in   
 the assembly.Assembly was about       
 jealousy. Mr Elliott told a story like
 if you are getting a new brother or   
 sister you might get jealous because  
 you think your Mum and Dad don't want 
 you any more.                         
  At 12.00 Fiona went for her dinner,  
 she had crisps, cheese sandwiches, Kit
 Kat and an apple and a drink of       
 orange.                               
  At dinner play time Fiona had been   
 fighting with Mandy.When she got in   
 from play she got told off and had to 
 say sorry to Mandy.                   
  Fiona read her poem out of a book    
 called "Please Mrs Butler", and then  
 wrote about it.At play time Fiona was 
 pinched by Kevin Wain. It made a blue 
 mark on her arm. Mr Elliott said he   
 was not suprised.
