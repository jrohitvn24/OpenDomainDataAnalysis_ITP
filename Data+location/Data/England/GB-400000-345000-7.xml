		<content>  Boltons is a big copper firm in      
Froghall on 32 acres in the  narrow    
Churnet valley. There used to be       
copper deposits in the valley; now     
they use scrap copper and imported     
copper from Canada and Zaire. They use 
gas to melt the copper. Formerly coal  
which came in canal boats was used.    
  750 people work there and 90% of the 
workers live nearby, in the Cheadle    
district. There are 150 managers and   
clerks, 40 foremen, 160 skilled workers
and 400 production workers. Men usually
work 39 hours a week, earning about    
three pounds an hour.                  
  Boltons make copper pipes for water  
supply and central heating; wire       
(including some special wire used in   
body scanners); strips, bars and       
castings. The products are sent all    
over Britain by Bolton's own lorries,  
and to India and North America.        </content>
