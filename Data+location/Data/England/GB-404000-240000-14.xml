		<title>14Market Gardening - one</title>
		<content>  Market gardening or horticulture is  
 good in this area because we have good
 soil, and the winters are not too     
 extreme.It is a central area for      
 distributing to other parts of the    
 country.                              
      In Wickhamford the market        
 gardening is mainly family businesses 
 and some have formed cooperatives.    
      Many changes have been made,     
 glass houses have been fitted with    
 larger panes to give more light.      
 Farmers have kept up to date in       
 technology,they have computers to     
 control the heat,ventilation, and the 
 amount of fertiliser needed by the    
 plants.                               
      Some of the crops are peppers,   
 cucumbers, lettuce, sprouts, cabbages 
 and tomatoes.
