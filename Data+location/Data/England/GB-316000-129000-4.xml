		<content> There are the statistically expected  
 number of elderly people living in the
 village and especial provision has    
 been made for them-as long ago as 1616
 Sir Richard Grobham established 10    
 Alms houses which are now occupied by 
 elderly single people.The Greenway    
 housing estate has a number of        
 bungalows in one area which are       
 primaraly for elderly tenants.The     
 Darby Way estate has 30 purpose-built 
 bungalows with a warden who is        
 availableto assist if required.At the 
 centre of the complex is a meeting    
 room with all facilities and a small  
 kitchen for informal or formal        
 meetings of the elderly of the        
 estate.In this building there is a    
 weekly day centre for 20 or so "frail 
 elderly" who are trasported to and fro
 home,given a cooked meal and to join  
 in many suitable activities.          </content>
