		<title>18WOOTTON GENERAL STORES</title>
		<content>  The owners of Wootton General Stores 
 have run it for twelve months.The shop
 is between 60 and 70 years old,though 
 it has not always been a grocery shop.
 It first opened as a newspaper shed on
 the other side of the road, but the   
 owner, a Mr.Conway, bought the shop on
 the other side of the road.At the time
 it was a house, but it was later      
 converted into a general store.       
  They are kept in business all year   
 round by regular customers.In the     
 summer it is slightly busier because  
 of passing trade from the Sealink Car 
 Ferry.                                
  The shop is open from 6a.m. to 9p.m. 
 except Sunday when it is open from    
 9a.m till 1p.m. The shop sells a wide 
 range of foodstuffs, including fresh  
 fruit and vegetables, newspapers,     
 tobacco, alcoholic beverages, etc.
