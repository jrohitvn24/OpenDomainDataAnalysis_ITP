		<title>12BACK LANES _ WALLSEND</title>
		<content> Most of the{housing}in Wallsend is    
 built in terraces with lanes in       
 between which are used for{social}as  
 well as utilitarian purposes.Children 
 spend a great deal of time in the     
 lanes on bikes,playing football,      
 hopscotch,jackpot,swingball,tennis,   
 hide and seek and many other{games. } 
 Dad uses the back lane to park or work
 on the car and this in turn becomes a 
 prop in many of the children's games. 
 Mum, while hanging out the washing,   
 takes the opportunity for a gossip    
 with the neighbours or gives the baby 
 an airing.Often the back lane is      
 obscured by washing hung across it. At
 times it becomes almost impassable    
 with so many activities taking place. 
 The lifestyle of the{community}centres
 on the back lanes.                    
                                       
                                       </content>
