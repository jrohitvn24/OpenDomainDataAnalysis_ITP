		<title>02S.W.GUILDFORD:LOSELEY PARK</title>
		<content>  Loseley Park is a historic home built
 in the Elizabethan period from 1562 to
 1568 by Sir William More. The house   
 has not changed throughout the        
 centuries but within there have been  
 gradual additions of furniture, books 
 and paintings from each succeeding    
 generation. Some of the more famous   
 portraits are of Elizabeth I and James
 I.                                    
  The family of the More Molyneuxs     
 still live at Loseley and farm 1000   
 acres. The land is used for dairy     
 cattle and the Jersey herd's milk     
 eventually produces yoghurt, cream and
 ice-cream. This produce is sold       
 throughout the surrounding area. Fruit
 and vegetables are available from the 
 farm shop. In spite of the farm's     
 lucrative business, Loseley Park      
 retains its aura of history.
