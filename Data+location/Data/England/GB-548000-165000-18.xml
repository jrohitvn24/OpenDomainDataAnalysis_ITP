		<title>18The Wood's steam engines.</title>
		<content> The Wood family have been involved    
 with steam engines since 1861 when    
 Thomas  Wood bought an Aveling and    
 Porter traction engine.In the 1870's  
 Thomas Wood had a contract to plough  
  the battle fields of the             
 Franco- Prussian War.After this he    
 increased the number and types of     
 steam engines in the company and      
 included ploughing engines, steam     
 rollers and road locomotives.The road 
 locomotives had more gears and large  
 water tanks and were used for long    
 road haulage.Steam lorries were used  
 in 1902 to carry local crops to       
 market. The steam engines were        
 replaced after WW1 by diesel and few  
 remain in working order.Mr.E.Wood     
 still has two steam engines that are  
 taken to rallies through out the S.E. 
 Repair works at the Foundary garage   
 are still in their Victorian condition</content>
