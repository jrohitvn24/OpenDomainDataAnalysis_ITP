		<title>14Wallington Police Station</title>
		<content>It was built in 1915 AD and is situated
in Stafford Road, Wallington. In June  
1985 there were 45 men and 5 women     
police officers stationed at           
Wallington. On patrol, officers take   
with them a personal radio, handcuffs, 
a truncheon and notebooks for recording
accidents and incidents. A normal day  
is divided into 4 reliefs; early, late,
night and off duty(which can be called 
out if necessary). At Wallington there 
are 4 panda cars. They are used by in- 
dividual officers for patrolling larger
areas of Wallington. There is also an  
area car which patrols the whole divi- 
sion. A police officer could be        
expected to deal with anything from    
murder to finding a lost budgie! The   
most prevalent crimes in Wallington are
burglary and damage and thefts of motor
vehicles.
