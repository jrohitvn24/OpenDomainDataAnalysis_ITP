		<content> We asked 82 people about the sport    
 and leisure pursuits that they take   
 part in Dodworth. We found that there 
 were a variety of sporting activities 
 ;from keep fit to golf ,dancing to    
 Karate. There is also a wide selection
 of Leisure facilitees including -Scout
 and Guide Movement,Young Wives,Working
 Mens Club and Comunity Centre for the 
 elderly.Of the people we asked only 18
 % didnt take part in anything in      
 Dodworth and the majority of these    
 didnt realsise what there was to      
 do.Most people would like to see a    
 Sports Centre in Dodworth,but of      
 course this is not pratically or      
 financially possible.The five most    
 popular pursuits in Dodworth are      
 public house,The Scout and Guide      
 movements,Football,Bowling and Clubs.
