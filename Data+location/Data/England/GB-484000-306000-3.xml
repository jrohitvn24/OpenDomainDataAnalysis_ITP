		<title>03Oakham Church</title>
		<content> The present Oakham Parish Church was  
 built in the 14th Century although    
 there has been a Church here since    
 Norman times.  The present church was 
 restored in the 19th century.  It is  
 one of the best church buildings in   
 the county.  There are four items of  
 interest kept in the church.  Two are 
 beautiful Elizabethan chalices,       
 another is the Oakham Bible which was 
 written on parchment a couple of years
 before Magna Carta.  The fourth thing 
 is an alabaster figure of a girl      
 called Anne Burton who died at the    
 beginning of the Civil War.
