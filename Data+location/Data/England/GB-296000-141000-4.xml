		<title>04THE CASTLE 2</title>
		<content> restored and added to in the 19th     
 century. During the Civil war, the    
 castle was first held by Thomas       
 Luttrell against the Royalists who    
 took control of it in 1642. The       
 Parliamentary troops took over the    
 castle again after a six month siege  
 and in 1650, an order was made to pull
 down the fortifications. Before all   
 the fortifications were pulled down,  
 the Luttrell family paid a fine which 
 allowed them to go back and live in   
 the castle. About this time the       
 stables were rebuilt after being      
 damaged during the Civil War.         
 In 1949 a Property Company bought the 
 castle but allowed Geoffrey Luttrell  
 to live there. In 1954 the Crown      
 Commissioners offered to sell the land
 back to the Luttrells. In 1976 the    
 castle and 30 acres of parkland were  
 presented to the National Trust.      </content>
