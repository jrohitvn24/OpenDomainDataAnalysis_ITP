		<title>03EMPLOYMENT IN GOOSTREY</title>
		<content> Goostrey is now very much a dormitory 
 village with people travelling to work
 in a variety of places such as Crewe, 
 Manchester, Northwich, Knutsford      
 and Congleton. Most people travel     
 by car, many making use of the        
 convenient access to the M6 motorway  
 at Holmes Chapel. The village has a   
 station on the Crewe to Manchester    
 line with an hourly service and extra 
 trains at peak hours.                 
                                       
 Employment in the survey area is      
 mainly in farming, at Jodrell Bank,   
 and in shops, the bank, the garage    
 etc. in the village.                  
                                       
 There are some self-employed people   
 working from home including computer  
 consultants, an author and a tree     
 surgeon.
