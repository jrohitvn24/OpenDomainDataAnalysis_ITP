 Widcombe Manor is a privately owned   
 and very beautiful looking building.It
 has large grounds with a superbly kept
 garden.The surrounding land is green  
 and fertile containing a few fields.To
 the rear of the Manor is what looks   
 like a pony paddock.There is a narrow 
 overgrown footpath which follows about
 two thirds of the perimeter.Running   
 past the Manor grounds is a scenic "B"
 road.                                 
     Further along this road there are 
 several cottages and a few large and  
 ornate houses.Opposite one of the     
 larger houses is the church of        
 St.Thomas a Becket.This church was    
 erected in 1498.Just outside the      
 church gates is a war monument        
 dedicated to the soldiers lost in the 
 two world wars.                       </content>
