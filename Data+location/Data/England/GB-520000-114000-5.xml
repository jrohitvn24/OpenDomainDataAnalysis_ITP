		<content>           Polo by Nicole.             
   One person stands at the top of the 
 playground and as many people as you  
 like at the bottom. The person at the 
 top calls someone and gives them a    
 name of a thing, for example a flower 
 The person goes back and tells the    
 rest.  Everyone chooses the name of a 
 flower and someone calls them out.    
 The person at the top picks one. The  
 other person whose flower has been    
 chosen runs to the top and back       
 spelling out POLO.  The person at the 
 top does so as well and whoever gets  
 back to their place first is the new  
 leader.                               
     Television Programmes by Cassie.  
   The leader stands away from the     
 group. He thinks of a T.V.Programme   
 and says the initials.If someone can  
 think of the name they run four times 
 and shout it out.If right they're it. </content>
