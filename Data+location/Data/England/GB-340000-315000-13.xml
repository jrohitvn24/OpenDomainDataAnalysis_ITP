		<title>13PARACHUTING - THE CONFLICT</title>
		<content> The disturbance from aircraft used by 
 the parachutists has caused           
 considerable conflict amongst the     
 local people in recent years.  It has 
 led to two public enquiries where an  
 active group of concerned locals have 
 sought to prevent the parachutists    
 from having legal planning permission 
 to use the airfield.  At the second   
 enquiry, a compromise was reached,    
 allowing a more limited number of     
 jumps to take place.  These are       
 restricted to Wednesdays and          
 week-ends.                            
                                       
 The effect of this legal battle on the
 local community has been quite marked.
 Many have said that the experience of 
 neighbour standing against neighbour  
 in the courtroom is one which will not
 be forgotten easily.
