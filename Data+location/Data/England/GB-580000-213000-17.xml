		<content> I am woken up in the morning by an    
 alarm clock,sometimes I go and make a 
 cup of tea.I have breakfast normally  
 sausages,fried bread,mushrooms,and    
 bacon and egg.Next I go into my       
 cupboard and find some cloth.I cut out
 some shapes and sew and stuff them .  
 At ten o clock I go shopping with my  
 mum. When I get back I ask for        
 something to eat.My Mum says "In a    
 moment.You're always hungry".My baby  
 brother starts crying and I take him  
 in.It's just after 12." It's gone     
 dinner time, "I said" he's crying     
 again".Mum says He's hungry." in a    
 tired voice.We have African soup-"Ugh!
 It's got too much chillie pepper !"   
 After dinner we play out and looked   
 for lizards on the old railway        
 bank.After tea we play games until bed
 time at nine o clock .
