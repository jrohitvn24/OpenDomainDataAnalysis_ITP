		<title>17History of St.Paul's Church</title>
		<content>    Choppington was part of the Parish 
 of Bedlington until 1866 when         
 St.Paul's came into being. The Parish 
 of St.Paul's covers Choppington,      
 Guidepost, Stakeford, and part of     
 Bomarsund. The church probably came   
 into being with the opening of the    
 mines and the resulting rise in local 
 population. Nowadays there are        
 reminders of the mines within the     
 church. The brass processional was    
 bought in memory of all the miners who
 lost their lives in the mines at      
 Choppington. Many miners are buried in
 St. Paul's churchyard.                
    Glebe Terrace which is opposite St.
 Paul's, once belonged to the church.  
 The houses were built on land owned by
 the church- known as a glebe- and so  
 rent for them had to be paid to the   
 Parish. The houses are now privately  
 owned.                                </content>
