		<title>13GHOSTS OF BATTLE ABBEY</title>
		<content> THERE ARE MANY STORIES OF GHOSTS BEING
 SEEN AROUND BATTLE ABBEY.THE MOST     
 FAMOUS IS PROBABLY THE COWLED MONK WHO
 LAID A CURSE ON THE OCCUPANTS         
 AFTER THE DISSOLUTION,SAYING          
 THAT THEY WOULD DIE BY FIRE OR WATER. 
 THERE ARE OTHER REPORTS OF MONKS BEING
 SEEN IN THE GROUNDS AT NIGHT.A WHITE  
 LADY HAUNTS THE GATE-HOUSE AND ON THE 
 ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS 
 CRIES OF MEN AND HORSES CAN BE HEARD  
 FROM THE BATTLEFIELD AND KING HAROLD  
 HAS BEEN SEEN WITH AN ARROW IN HIS    
 EYE.AT CHRISTMAS 1984 TWO GROUPS OF   
 GIRLS SAW INDEPENDENTLY A WHITE FIGURE
 ON THE GALLERY IN THE ABBOT'S HALL    
 WHICH THEN MOVED ACROSS TO THE ABBOT'S
 CHAPEL.NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION HAS BEEN
 FOUND FOR THIS.THERE ARE OTHER STORIES
 OF MYSTERIOUS FIGURES AND SHADOWS IN  
 THE SCHOOL AT NIGHT,NOT ALL OF WHICH  
 ARE IMAGINED.                         </content>
