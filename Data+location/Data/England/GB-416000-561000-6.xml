		<content> TUGGY ON BLACK SQUARE.Two ten year old
 girls made this up in 1984.They use   
 squares of tarmac outside the old     
 toilets.Someone is 'ON'and everyone   
 else is on a black square.We run      
 between squares and the person who is 
 'ON' has to tug someone before they   
 reach another square. The person      
 tugged is then 'ON'.                  
                                       
 KINGO. The king drops the ball into   
 the centre of a circle of             
 children.They flick the ball with     
 their feet around the circle.         
 Eventually the ball goes through      
 someones legs and that person is 'ON'.
 The punch, punches the ball as far as 
 possible and the person who is 'ON'   
 runs to get it. He or she hits the    
 rest of the people with the ball.     
 When everyone has been hit the game   
 ends.                                 </content>
