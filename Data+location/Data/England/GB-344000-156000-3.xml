		<content>  When we went to visit this shop,one  
 of the two largest in the village, we 
 crossed the main road outside School  
 and walked along the narrow pavement. 
  We noticed a newly built wall as we  
 came up to the left hand side of the  
 Post Office. It was made from stone   
 and not bricks. Hanging outside there 
 is a special red and yellow sign      
 saying Post Office. The building is   
 blue and white, with a letter box in  
 the side of the wall.                 
  The Post Office part is surrounded by
 special glass to protect the money. If
 someone smashes the glass it sets off 
 an alarm. We could buy 8 different    
 sorts of stamps if we wanted to.      
  In the shop part there are three     
 counters where you pay for things and 
 40 shelves of food to buy. A tin of   
 Baked Beans costs 21p and a pink wafer
 biscuit is 14p.                       </content>
