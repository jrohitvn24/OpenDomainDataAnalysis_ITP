		<content>  There are lot's of clubs in          
 Aslockton.                            
 Brownie's  is held in the church hall 
 and Mrs Jones runs that.   It is on   
 every Tuesday and they play games and 
 talk about various things which are   
 coming up and they learn various      
 skills, like drawing and cooking      
 and if they do well they are awarded  
 badges.  They also play games and go  
 on treasure hunts and lots of things  
 like that.They hold coffee mornings   
 and fetes and they go on parade.   In 
 cubs they go on camp and they play    
 games like cricket and rounders and   
 they do badges like first aid,animal  
 lovers, gardners,entertainment,hobbies
 and homelife.  Most of the children in
 our school have been in cubs or       
 brownies.  When they leave, the boys  
 join the scouts and the girls join the
 guides.                               </content>
