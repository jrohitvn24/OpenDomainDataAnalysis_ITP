		<content> Blighfield Womenn's Institute meets   
 once a month on a Monday evenig at    
 Newton village Hall.  There are only  
 eighteen members, at the moment,      
 because they do not cover a very      
 populated area.  They have a speaker  
 every month and cover a wide range of 
 topics from embroidery to microwave   
 cookery.  They celebrate christmas    
 with a party at Amaston Village Hall  
 and an annual lunch is held in a      
 membrs home, which is the only fund   
 raising event as unlike most WIs they 
 cannot otain money through usual ways 
 with jumble sales and coffee mornings 
 owing to the lack of people in the    
 area.  They celebrated their daimond  
 Jubilee in 1985 with a dinner.        
 Blithfield WI is linked with Abots    
 Bromley WI for the RM held in London  
 and belongs to the parkside group and 
 to the Staffordshire federation.      </content>
