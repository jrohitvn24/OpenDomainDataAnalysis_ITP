		<title>02TETTENHALL GREENS</title>
		<content>   Upper and Lower Greens,listed under 
the Commons Registration Act 1965,are  
today mainly used for recreation.The   
area was once forest land and many     
types of tree are still protected by   
Tettenhall Tree Preservation Order.    
   Lower Green,historic centre of      
Tettenhall and formerly,site of Wakes  
Week,has seen few changes in recent    
years,though the A41 built in 1812 by  
the Town's Turnpike Trust,reduced its  
size.The sandstone ridge known as      
Tettenhall Rock separates the two      
greens.                                
   Upper Green is the focus of         
Tettenhall village.Its historic        
buildings,including the Clock Tower,   
must be in sympathy with their         
surroundings.A gift of land on the far 
side of A41 extended the green to 6    
acres,now including a paddling pool.
