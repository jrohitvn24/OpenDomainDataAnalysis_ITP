		<title>14CHURCHES AROUND S.E.DEWSBURY</title>
		<content> There are 5 buildings of the Church of
 England,1 Catholic,11 non-conformist,3
 mosques and 5 buildings of other      
 denominations.Attendance at most      
 churches has declined,particularly    
 near the town centre, because of re-  
 location of the white popultion to    
 surrounding areas. Town centre housing
 now occupied by Asian people explains 
 the establishment of 3 mosques        
 including one of Europe's largest.    
 Most churches have reduced the number 
 of Sunday services,and some buildings 
 are no longer served by their own     
 vicar or priest, but share a clergyman
 with a number of others.Two churches  
 of different denominations sometimes  
 share the same buildings for their    
 services.Many churches provide leisure
 time activities through various       
 organisations such as Scouts, Guides, 
 men's and women's societies.          </content>
