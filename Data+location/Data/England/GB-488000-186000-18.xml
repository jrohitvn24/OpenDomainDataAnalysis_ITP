		<title>18WOOBURN GREEN-FESTIVAL</title>
		<content>Each year in September an Arts Festival
is held.For two weeks,plays are acted, 
at concerts of classical music and song
are performed by professional and      
amateur musicians.Jazz concerts are    
held,master classes for instrumental-  
ists and most enjoyable poetry readings
.A few famous artists draw crowds from 
surrounding areas.                     
  Concerts have been held in the Tithe 
Barn and in the church.An exhibition   
of local artists' work in oils,water   
colours,sculpture and photography is   
held.The Festival started as a local   
project,using local talent,but over    
the years has become much larger,      
incorporating performers from London   
and so some items have to be performed 
in larger halls,outside the parish.
