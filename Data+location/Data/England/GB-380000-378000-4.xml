		<title>04CHANGES IN WILMSLOW</title>
		<content>  We interviewed two people, Mrs.      
 Gefferay about{1965}and Mrs. May about
{1945. They both talked about the      
{central part of Wilmslow as well as   
{about S.W.Wilmslow.                   
  There used to be two cinemas,one     
 under the bridge by the station and   
 The Rex which is still open in        
 Wilmslow.                             
  Mrs May and Mrs Gefferay said that   
 these days there is nothing for       
 teenagers to  do.                     
  More people used to go to church.    
  There were not very many cars,Mrs May
 and Mrs Gefferay always went to       
 Wilmslow by bus.                      
  There were not many shops, there were
 just small shops but in 1965 the      
 first big super_market was opened in  
 central Wilmslow.                     
  They both preferred Wilmslow in the  
 past.                                 </content>
