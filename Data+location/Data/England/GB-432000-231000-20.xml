		<content>This block is off the main Cotswold/   
Stratford tourist track. However there 
are a growing number of cottages let   
out to  visitors attracted to the peace
and unspoilt nature of the area.Besides
interest in the Brewery and the old    
houses of the villages the church at   
Great Rollright attracts many tourists.
It is a smallish church probably built 
on an earlier pagan site about 500     
years ago. Above the door is a Norman  
archway(Tympanium)beautifully carved to
depict the story of Jonah and the      
Whale.Above the porch was a floor where
the priest could hide.On the left of   
the porch is the oldest window still   
with the original glass.The oldest part
is about 500 years old. The chancel was
added l00 years later. The church still
has its original rood screen which is  
very colourful but higher up than it   
should be. There are 6 bells.          </content>
