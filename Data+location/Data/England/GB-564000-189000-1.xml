		<content>   The area surveyed includes the north
western section of Laindon, Dunton     
Wayletts and the edge of Little        
Burstead.                              
   The A127(T) divides the block into  
two distinct sections. To the south of 
the road the area is mainly residential
and industrial, whereas to the north,  
land is mainly agriculture.            
   The most important industrial site  
is the Ford Research and Engineering   
Centre at Dunton, where new cars and   
technical improvements are developed   
and tested. There are many small firms 
located on the rest of the industrial  
estate. New roads, such as West Mayne, 
are being built to improve             
communications and to attract new      
firms to the area as unemployment is a 
serious problem in the Laindon district
   Cereal growing is the main          
agricultural activity.                 </content>
