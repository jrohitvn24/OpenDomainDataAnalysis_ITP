		<title>02JOHN HARRISON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The present school site was           
 established in 1890 and the junior    
 department is housed in this early    
 building. In 1980 the Humberside      
 Authority replaced the Infant         
 Dept.,Hall/Dining Room,Staff-room and 
 toilets.To mark this occasion the     
 school was named after the inventor of
 the ships chronometer. There are 170  
 children on the roll of whom some 85% 
 stay for the school dinner on a       
 regular basis. The teachers provide a 
 range of extra curricula              
 activities:football, gymnastics,      
 netball,rounders and swimming. The    
 school is supported by a P.T.A. and it
 is the philosophy of the school to    
 involve parents within the school with
 the result that each day several      
 parents give their time and skills to 
 the teachers and children.Many of them
 attend the Family Assembly on Fridays.</content>
