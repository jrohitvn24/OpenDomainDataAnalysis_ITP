		<content>{DUNSMORE, A CHURCH SAVED              
 The Church of the Resurrection at     
 Dunsmore seats about 40 people and was
 built in 1897. For many years,        
 services had been conducted by        
 successive Rectors of Ellesborough but
 in1978 this practice ceased. Early in 
 1983, the Parochial Church Council    
 decided to sell the building. On      
 behalf of the villagers, the Dunsmore 
 Village Hall Ass. began a campaign    
 vigorously to oppose the sale.        
 Eventualy the authorities agreed to   
 lease the building to Trustees        
 appointed by the Village Hall Ass, on 
 the understanding that the community  
 would undertake to repair the building
 at its own cost and pay all outgoings.
 The congregation has given money and  
 labour generously to restore the      
 Church and regular services are now   
 held by the Minister of Ellesborough. </content>
