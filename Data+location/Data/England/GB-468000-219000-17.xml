game to play at playtimes.It is similar
to Tig,but when you get caught you have
to stand still with either your legs   
apart or your arms up.To be freed      
someone has to go under your legs or   
your arms.When you have been had three 
times you are had for the next game.   
                                       
FRENCH SKIPPING (ELASTIC).             
Three or more people can play this     
game.You have a long piece of elastic  
which you tie the ends together.One    
person stands either end of the        
elastic.Somebody jumps in and out of   
the elastic in a special sequence.If   
you do it wrong,you are out and another
person has a go.The object of the game 
is to see how high you can jump over   
the elastic.                           </content>
