		<title>10LOCAL GOVERNMENT,WITHERNSEA</title>
		<content>  Withernsea used to have a great deal 
 of local autonomy but with local      
 government reorganisation much power  
 has been lost.Only recently has the   
 town received parish council status.  
  The police station is centrally      
 situated but is not continually manned
 and during non-office hours calls are 
 routed to Hull.There is however       
 community policing.                   
  In education the 3 schools are       
 adjacent.There is an infants school   
 for ages 5-7,a junior school for ages 
 7-11,and a secondary comprehensive    
 high school for 11-18.The high school 
 claims to be the country's first      
 purpose built comprehensive being     
 established in 1957.The Institute     
 of FE,based in the high school,       
 provides a range of activities during 
 day and evening and the high school   
 6th form centre doubles as a YC.      </content>
