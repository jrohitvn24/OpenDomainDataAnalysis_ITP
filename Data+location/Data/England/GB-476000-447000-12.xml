 This incorporates a practice area for 
 Horse Trials, Cross Country, and Three
 day Eventing. The ditchs have been    
 widened in sections &amp; strengthened    
 with planks. There are raised grassy  
 platforms &amp; obstacles made with car   
 tyres. The ground is soft ideal for   
 horses. Groups of young people use the
 area for Orienteering (Cross Country  
 racing on foot using map &amp; compass.)  
 Shooting,the local farmers share the  
 rights, although they hold very few   
 shoots. This seems to be a good       
 arrangement it helps to control the   
 farm pests, Carrion Crow for example. 
 Walkers. Regularly the public         
 footpaths are walked by members of the
 Ramblers Association, thereby ensuring
 the paths are not obstructed and are  
 clearly signposted.
