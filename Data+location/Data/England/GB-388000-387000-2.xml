		<title>02STOCKPORT GRAMMAR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{  }The original site of{Stockport     
{Grammar School}is near the General    
 Post Office in Underbank in the heart 
 of Stockport. In 1826 a new site was  
 found 1 mile away opposite the Town   
 Hall. The present site has been in    
 existence since 1914.                 
    The first of the presently used    
 buildings was built in the form of two
 storeys of brick built classrooms and 
 laboratories around a stone flagged   
 quadrangle, one side opening onto a   
 cloistered walkway. The Hallam Hall   
 was the focus but today is used as a  
 library and occasionally as a function
 room.                                 
    In 1980, the nearby Girls' Convent 
 School was bought in order to         
 accomodate the first intake of girls  
 to the first year. The school now     
 contains nearly 1000 pupils.
