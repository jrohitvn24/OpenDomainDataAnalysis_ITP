		<content>Much of the land usage is residential. 
People live mainly in houses or flats  
built in the last 100 years. Most are  
brick houses built since 1945 by the   
Council to house surplus population in 
Wolverhampton. The few,Victorian       
terraced houses are small,dark, lacking
front gardens and sited in straight    
treeless streets. These now house      
immigrants of Asian or West Indian     
origin and poorer people. Modern houses
are larger,better equipped and set in  
more congenial open areas with curved  
grass verged tree-lined roads. Many    
people buy their Council houses and    
refurbish them. High-rise Council flats
allow many people to use small areas of
land but this causes occasional        
community problems particularly for    
families with children. Flats share    
well tended gardens and play areas.
