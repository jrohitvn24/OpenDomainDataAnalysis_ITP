		<title>06DAIRY (MILK) FARMING</title>
		<content> High Winsley Farm is a typical farm in
 this area. It has about 280 cattle    
 altogether, of which 2 are bulls, 20  
 dry cows, about 50 calves and 200     
 milking cows. To support this live    
 stock the farm has 3 tractors, 1      
 muck-spreader, 1 mower, and 1 muck    
 scraper. There are a number of        
 buildings used, including a dairy, a  
 mistale for calving cows, 4 barns for 
 feed storage and bedding, and cow and 
 calf pens in addition to a feed house.
 The farm is worked by 4 men, these    
 being the Foremen, 2 general          
 farmworkers and a relief milker. The  
 main problem at the present time is   
 the Milk Quotas. Farmers say these are
 too low, and if less imported milk was
 consumed the quota could be raised.   
 Too much milk is being produced and   
 the surplus has to be poured down the 
 drain or cattle sold off.             </content>
