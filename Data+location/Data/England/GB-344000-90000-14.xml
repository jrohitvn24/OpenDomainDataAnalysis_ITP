		<title>14The Melplash Show.</title>
		<content>      The Melplash Show dates back to  
 1847 when two Dorset farmers accepted 
 a challenge to prove who was the      
 better ploughman. The Melplash        
 Agricultural Society was then formed  
 and the first show took place in      
 Melplash in 1850. It is now held on   
 the last Thursday in August on the    
 riverside meadows between Bridport and
 West Bay though it still retains its  
 title as the Melplash Show.           
      The Show invites competition in  
 a wide variety of farming and         
 livestock attracting exhibitors from  
 far afield as well as locally. There  
 are also some 150 Trade Stands where  
 visitors can go shopping. There are   
 sections for Horticulture, Handicrafts
 and Home Produce and there is usually 
 a special attraction such as an       
 Aerobatic Team or Royal Navy          
 helicopters.                          </content>
