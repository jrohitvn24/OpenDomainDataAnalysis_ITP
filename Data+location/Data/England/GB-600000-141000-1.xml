		<content>Willesborough is east of Ashford. The  
area around the junior school is mostly
used for housing and shops. New brick  
built houses have appeared on old      
farming land.  Factories and the       
motorway have recently been built and  
they cover a large area. The children  
think the motorway is ugly, dangerous, 
noisy but fresh and clean nearby.      
Houses,factories, churches and many    
fields lie near the road. There was    
an old workhouse, used later as a      
hospital and now as flats and a        
nursery. The new William Harvey        
Hospital replaced the old hospital.    
Some old, dark cottages have Kent peg  
tiles and sashed windows. The new      
bungalows have tiled roofs,new windows 
and tidy, neat gardens.                
Three hundred more houses are being    
built at present on the eastern edge.
