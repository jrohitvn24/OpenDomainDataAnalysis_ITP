		<content> Not many children were lucky enough to
 have a bicycle. Buses were very rare  
 and in those days some were open      
 topped. The bus driver's took butter  
 and eggs to market for the local      
 people.                               
    There used to be ponds in Scampton 
 but due to land drainage they have now
 disappeared. In and on the ponds there
 used to be Mallard Ducks, Moor-hens   
 and frogs. In the winter there was ice
 to slide on.                          
    The Blacksmith used to shoe farm   
 horses and repair farm machinery he   
 also hooped wheels and sold milk to   
 the villagers in a can.               
    The carpenters made wheels,        
 cabinets and coffins, the cobbler made
 and repaired shoes. The cobblers shop 
 was also a place to gossip.
