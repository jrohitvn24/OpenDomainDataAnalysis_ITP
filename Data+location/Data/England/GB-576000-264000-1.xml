		<content> The location shown is one of high     
 grade agricultural land with arable   
 farms covering most of the area.      
 Farms are large many small fields     
 being merged, to accomodate sizeable  
 farm maachinery, with small building  
 replaced by large barns and grain     
 stores.  Where hedges have been taken 
 out, cover for game has been replaced 
 by smal woods and trees planted in    
 hedgerows.  Livestock farming has     
 declined, and only sheep and pigs are 
 now kept in this area.  With the      
 intensive mechanisation of            
 agriculture, people that live in this 
 locality nd work on the land are in   
 the minority, as most who reside here,
 commute to nearby towns, being        
 employed in many trades and           
 professions.  A number of retired     
 people have made their homes in the   
 area as the proximity of country towns</content>
