		<content>   The Brighton General Hospital was   
 first built as a workhouse.It covers  
 13 acres and cost Â£40,000 to build it.
 In 1865 it was owned by the parish of 
 Brighton until 1948 when the          
 government took it over with the      
 National Health Service.During the 1st
 World War it was called the Kitchener 
 Military Hospital &amp; 2000 Indian       
 soldiers were treated there.During the
 2nd World War a large group of Belgian
 refugees consisting of children &amp; nuns
 were brought over. Also Dunkirk       
 wounded,air raid and general military 
 patients were treated.Another incident
 of note was the dropping of a bomb on 
 the tennis courts near 'B' block.

 reconstruction was needed and it now  
 has 546 beds including 159 chronic    
 sick.
