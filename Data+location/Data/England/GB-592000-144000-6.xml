		<content> At Surrenden Ceramics they don't make 
 tiles but buy them from a firm called 
 Barbies. They design and print the    
 pattern on each tile. One Underground 
 station requires 70,000 tiles which   
 takes about 35 weeks to make. The     
 pattern is transferred on to each tile
 by silk screening and then goes into  
 the kiln for about 36 hours. The kiln 
 holds 2,000 tiles.                    
    Surrenden Ceramics also put special
 designs on to plates for indivdiual   
 customers requirements. First they    
 have to design a pattern then draw it 
 on tracing paper and make a           
 photographic transfer which is soaked 
 and then placed onto the plate. This  
 is smoothed into position and then the
 plate is put into the kiln and fired.
