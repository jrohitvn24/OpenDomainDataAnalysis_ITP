		<title>16LANDSCAPE IN SALISBURY</title>
		<content>{Landscape and buildings               
 Salisbury is a popular town because of
 the Cathedral with its 123m spire and 
 beautiful medieval architecture. The  
 centre is kept old by the council     
 listing buildings. New buildings must 
 be less than 12m so the Cathedral is  
 not obscured. Some medieval buildings 
 have shops built in them: one is the  
 cinema. The town centre is cramped    
 because of the narrow criss-cross     
 streets laid down when Salisbury was  
 first planned in 1220. Salisbury is in
 a valley where three rivers meet, and 
 is surrounded by chalk hills.         
 There are some open spaces by the     
 rivers giving the impression that it  
 is not overcrowded.                   
 Mallards, moorhens, swans and fish are
 found in the clear rivers.In the trees
 live animals such as grey squirrels.  
 Salisbury is a lovely town.           </content>
