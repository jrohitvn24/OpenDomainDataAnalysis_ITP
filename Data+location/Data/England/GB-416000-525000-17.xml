		<content>{MR.D.SHORT of West Auckland,Tuesday   
{2nd.July,1985.}My first task is to get
 washed and shaved and clean my teeth. 
 I then sit down with a cup of tea and 
 read the'Northern Echo'(our local     
 daily newspaper) until 8-15 a.m.At    
 8-50 I leave in the car,taking my wife
 Joan to work and daughter Alison to   
 school on my way to work.At 9-00a.m. I
 arrive at South Durham Fibres where I 
 am Technical Manager.We make synthetic
 fibres for the brush trade from poly- 
 vinyl chloride,polyethylene,and       
 styrene.My first duty is to check the 
 previous 24 hours'production.This     
 takes me to about 10-00a.m.when I log 
 and correlate the results.I then have 
 a quick cup of coffee.Today is quite  
 busy,as I have 3 sales representatives
 coming to see me.As Technical Manager 
 I am also involved with engineering   
 and electrical problems.{SEE P.18.....</content>
