   This a game which quite a few people
 can play at a time.                   
   First you get a ball and stand about
 five yards away from the wall and let 
 people run across in front of the     
 wall.When they get half way you throw 
 the ball at them and if you miss them 
 they stand at the other side of the   
 wall.You repeat this for each person  
 who is playing.                       
   If when you throw the ball it hits  
 them above the knees and below the    
 face then that person sits out of the 
 game until everyone else is hit and   
 then the game starts again with       
 somebody else throwing the ball.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
