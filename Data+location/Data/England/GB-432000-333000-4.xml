		<content> Saint Augustine's Church is a         
 Church of England church and          
 people who go there are               
 Christians, who believe in God        
 and Jesus. We sit on wooden           
 benches called a pew and kneel on     
 little cushions to pray.  The vicar   
 talks about our holy book, the Bible, 
 which rests on a special stand called 
 a lectern.  When it is time for Sunday
 School the children leave the main    
 part of the church and go to another  
 room where we draw, paint and learn   
 about God and have a Bible story.     
 When we have finished we go back to   
 the adults, have a cup of tea and go  
 home.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
