 I found out about the pets that people
 kept in the homes in the south east   
 part of Ogbourne St George village.   
 Most homes had a pet. We looked at 23 
 houses.The most popular was a cat,    
 there are 18 cats. There are 11 dogs, 
 2 rabbits, 1 pony,3 fish.One household
 has 4 dogs and cat. The old people    
 have the birds, I expect the birds are
 easy to keep they don't need          
 exercising and they are cheaper to    
 feed. Old people like the birds for   
 company if they are on their own.     
 Younger people have dogs because they 
 have the energy to exercise them.Dogs 
 cost more to keep and belong to       
 households that are earning wages.
