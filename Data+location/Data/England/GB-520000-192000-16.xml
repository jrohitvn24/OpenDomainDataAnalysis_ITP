 GAMES - STUCK IN THE MUD              
 The game  can be for any number of    
 players.One person is it or two       
 people, depending on the amount of    
 players.When you say go! the person or
 people that are it run after the other
 people.When they touch the other      
 people,they have to stand with their  
 legs open.When another person who is  
 running from the people that are it   
 goes through their legs they are safe 
 and can not become it.When you have   
 been touched three times you become   
 it.When everyone has been stuck and   
 noone can free them the game starts   
 again.You can play it anywhere but I  
 play it outside at St. Paul's Church  
 Hall with the guides mostly.
