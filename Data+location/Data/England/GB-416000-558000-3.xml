 football house matches between        
 Saturn,Mercury,Jupiter and my team    
 Neptune.My house team Neptune,won.    
    I then went home and had my tea and
 went out to play football with my     
 friends.A lot of my friends were      
 playing.We carried on playing         
 football.Then we played cricket,I got 
 two people out,but my team lost.My mam
 had taken my sister to Brownies as    
 there was a Brownie coffee evening.I  
 then came in and got ready for bed and
 watched my television.Then I turned my
 television off at about 9.30pm and    
 went to bed.
