		<content> Every summer in the recreation field  
 as the school breaks up for the long  
 summer holiday the Village Association
 organises a big Gala. We have stalls  
 and                                   
 games,pop,ice-cream,plants,toys,tombol
 a,go-carts,cocoanut shy,a bouncing    
 castle,swing-boats,refreshments and   
 toilets are in the school. In the     
 middle of the field is an arena where 
 the parade comes when it has walked   
 through the village. Someone important
 is invited to open the Gala and then  
 the fancy dress competition is judged.
 Everyone from the village and lots    
 from other places come and it finishea
 when the raffle is drawn. The Village 
 Association has been using the money  
 to make the recreation field better.
