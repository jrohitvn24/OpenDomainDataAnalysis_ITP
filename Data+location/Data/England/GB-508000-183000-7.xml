		<title>07THE COMPASS THEATRE.</title>
		<content>  The Compass{Theatre}is  in Ickenham, 
 in Glebe Avenue, opposite the station 
 (the top left square of the map).  It 
 is  not  just  a  theatre,  it  is  a 
{Community Arts Centre.}               
  The windows display  posters showing 
 current and coming events.  There are 
 musicals,  plays,  jazz  concerts and 
 regular clubs  like  pottery, art and 
 junior drama.                         
  Inside, the  stage  is  in  the main 
 hall. Nearby are  dressing  rooms for 
 the   performers.   There  are   also 
 workshops and storage spaces for  the 
 props and staging.  The  Compass also 
 has its own Bistro.                   
  From  the  outside  the Compass is a 
 mixture of old and new. The hall is a 
 newer part. At the front  is a garden 
 area with rose-beds and  also the car 
 park entrance. (See photograph)       
  Sadly, the Compass faces closure.    </content>
