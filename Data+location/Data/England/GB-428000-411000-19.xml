		<content> We interviewed ten people about how   
 things have changed at Woolley        
 Colliery. One told us how they used to
 have oil lamps and candles for light. 
 The air was so dusty that they had    
 pieces of material to cover the sugar 
 bowls. Now the slag heaps have grass  
 and trees growing on them. We now have
 a playing field, swings and a slide   
 where the railway used to be. School  
 had over a hundred pupils because     
 families were bigger. Now we have     
 forty-three children. seven of the    
 people interviewed said that life was 
 better when they were young, even     
 though it was not as comfortable.     
   Windhill Gate Farm is on the hill   
 -side above the colliery. It was built
 about 1600, but now the N.C.B. have   
 bought the whole farm.The family are  
 leaving after owning it for 125 years.
