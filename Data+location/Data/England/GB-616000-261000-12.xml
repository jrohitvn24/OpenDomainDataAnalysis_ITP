		<title>12Antiques in Debenham (2).</title>
		<content>  One of the owners of Flemings        
Antiques is Mr Angus McBean,well-known 
for his photographs of stage and screen
stars.                                 
  The owners of Guildhall Crafts bought
the Tudor building three and a half    
years ago because it was cheaper than  
similar properties in Essex.They sell  
pine furniture that they have stripped 
themselves and small craft items.Some  
of the furniture is Victorian,but this 
is now difficult to obtain.            
  About 60% of the stock at Forester's 
Hall Antiques is reproduction          
furniture which is made there and many 
other items are less than a hundred    
years old because antiques are in short
supply.The owners report a trend for   
young people to buy old furniture      
because it is cheaper than modern goods
of a similar quality.
