		<title>08LOCAL HISTORY OF HARVEL AREA</title>
		<content> In Pre-Roman times long-distance trade
 crossed England using the easiest     
 route.  One of these followed the     
 North Downs escarpment for many miles,
 and later the medieval Pilgrims Way   
 followed this same track.  It can     
 still be traced,often as a bridleway, 
 through the Holly Hill area.  There is
 also a Ridge Track connecting         
 Luddesdowne to the Pilgrims Way.  This
 passes near the un-used Early-Norman  
 Dode Church.  The village of Dode was 
 probably destroyed by the Black Death.
  Other ancient trackways include Old  
 Commority and Heron Hill Lane.  Many  
 local buildings and churches are      
 constructed with flints obtained from 
 the hills where there are remains of  
 Dene-holes. The wooded nature of the  
 area probably led to  coppicing and   
 the charcoal industry in the middle   
 Ages when Harvel originated.          </content>
