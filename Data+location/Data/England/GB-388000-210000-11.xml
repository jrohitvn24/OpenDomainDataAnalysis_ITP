		<title>11SHEEPSCOMBE CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content> Cricketers use the pavilion for eating
 and changing. When one team is all out
 the players go in for tea. The ladies 
 take turns to do the cricket teas.    
 They bring food like sandwiches and   
 cakes and tea and squash to drink. Tea
 costs 60p for men. When the match is  
 over everyone goes to the pub for a   
 drink.                                
  Not many villagers play cricket. The 
 older people settle for gentle walks  
 while our parents age group likes     
 swimming, tennis, squash and sailing. 
 People go riding in Sheepscombe, but  
 mostly they go to Stroud for sport.   
 They go 20 miles for sailing. The only
 sports clubs in Sheepscombe are       
 cricket and table tennis. Some people 
 think there should be more sports     
 facilities in Sheepscombe. They would 
 like a tennis court near the Village  
 Hall and a flat sports field.         </content>
