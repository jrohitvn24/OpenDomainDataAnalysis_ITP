		<title>19A Farm In Our Area Described</title>
		<content> Atway Farm is in the north east of    
 our rectangle.The owners of the farm  
 are Mr.&amp; Mrs.Smale.Most of the        
 buildings are made of local stone with
 some cob.The farm house and farm      
 buildings are edged with red bricks   
 because you dont usually find straight
 stones.Some of the sheds and barns    
 were made of corrugated iron and also 
 some galvanize.All the stones we saw  
 were different.On the farm house on   
 the west side of the wall is galvanize
 to protect the wall from the wind.    
 Mr.Smale shares his farm equipment    
 with his brother and father.They have 
 five tractors (One big tractor and    
 four small tractors.)1 forager,1      
 baler,4 trailers and a mower.They have
 seventy Friesian cows,16 bull calves,2
 sheep and 4 lambs.They own 150 acres  
 of farmland.120 acres for grass,30 for
 cereals.                              </content>
