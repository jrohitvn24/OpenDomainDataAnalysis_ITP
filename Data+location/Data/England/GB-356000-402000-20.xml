		<content>Our area, once a ribbon development    
with allotments small holdings and     
farms, is now densely populated with   
flats, maisonettes and houses.  Even   
Hawkley Hall, a Jacobean building,     
where Oliver Cromwell was reputed to   
have slept, was reduced to rubble to   
make way for private housing. The canal
once a busy waterway for working barges
is now used for leisure. The cotton    
mills are being redeveloped and coal   
mines have closed taking many jobs with
them. The cooling towers and electtric-
ity works are soon to come down. Also  
the tower blocks, too costly to repair,
may be demolished. Reorganisation of   
Secondary Education will give this area
its own High School. Our old primary   
school building has become a Moslem    
Mosque. The busy railway branch line   
has been lifted, the embankment lowered
and a ring road is planned in its stead</content>
