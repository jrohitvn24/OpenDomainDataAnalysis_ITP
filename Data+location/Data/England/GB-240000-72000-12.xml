		<title>12Farming in Chilsworty</title>
		<content>   One farm in our area keeps{90 head  
{of cattle}for{beef and dairy products.
 This is the maximum amount they can   
 keep on their{66 acres of land.}To    
 supplement their grazing the animals  
 are fed{cattle cake}mornings and      
 evenings. Each year{silage and hay is 
{harvested for winter feeding.}The     
 farmer rises each day at 7.15 and his 
 daily work continues till 10.00 each  
 night.Visits to market in and around  
 neighbouring towns are as frequent as 
 necessary as the farm{breeds most of  
{its own stock}often borrowing a bull  
 from other farmers in the district.   
 This farm also keeps two pigs for     
 special occasions. The farmer thought 
 that farming had become less labour-  
 intensive over the years with         
 increasing mechanisation but was not  
 in favour of factory farming as such.
