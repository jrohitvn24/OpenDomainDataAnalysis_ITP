		<title>02 HOUSING-HAZELWOOD ESTATE</title>
		<content> {Hazelwood} is a small private estate 
of houses built since 1950.            
 The roads on the estate are unmade and
apart from a {small community hall}    
used for parties and social functions  
there are no amenities.  The {471 bus} 
links Hazelwood with Orpington,Cudham, 
Pratts Bottom and Knockholt, but only  
operates once every 2 to 3 hours.      
 The estate is surrounded by farmland, 
used mainly for animal rearing.        
              **********               
 On the opposite side of the road to   
Hazelwood is {Endsleigh Cattery},      
licenced to board 64 cats.             
 The cats come from an area 15 miles in
radius including West Wickham, Croydon 
Dartford and Forest Hill.              
 Each cat has a separate pen with a    
small wooden house with a cushion and  
carpeting. The cats are fed twice a day
and kept scrupulously clean.           </content>
