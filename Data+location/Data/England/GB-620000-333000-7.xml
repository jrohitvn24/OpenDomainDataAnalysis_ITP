		<title>07Gunton Area Employment</title>
		<content>  All the farms and cottages           
surrounding Gunton Park were owned by  
the estate which afforded employment to
the majority of inhabitants of the park
and surrounding countryside. Today,    
with increasing mechanisation, the     
privatly owned farms are managed with  
very little outside labour, and that   
often on a casual basis. The majority  
travel by car to the nearby major      
towns or Norwich to find employment in 
small industries and businesses.Others 
are retired or self-employed, growing  
garden produce on doing odd jobs. In   
the new Gunton  Hall complex with its  
57 inhabitants those of working age    
are professionals, on own businesses.  
Between 30 and 40 people are employed  
at the Hall on restoration ,maintenance
gardening, etc. some private houses    
outside the park are owned by city     
workers wanting to live in the country.</content>
