		<title>10SHEEP FARMING IN NAPTON</title>
		<content> The farmer's wife came to school and  
 told us about a lamb which was born in
 a puddle. She took the lamb indoors   
 and gave it some gin and warm milk.   
 She put a long tube down to its tummy 
 so that it did not go into its lungs. 
 When the lamb got better she let it   
 loose in the field.                   
 Sheeps wool - before we washed the    
 wool we took out the straw, bits of   
 twigs, insects and maggots, then we   
 washed it in soapy water and rinsed it
 in clean water and let it dry. When it
 was dry it felt softer than before.   
 After we cleaned the wool we tried to 
 dye it. First we got some berries,    
 which we boiled with water in a       
 saucepan for 8 minutes.  We took the  
 liquid off the cooker and added  the  
 wool which we left for 30 minutes.    
 We pressed some wool on paper to see  
 how much oil was in it.               </content>
