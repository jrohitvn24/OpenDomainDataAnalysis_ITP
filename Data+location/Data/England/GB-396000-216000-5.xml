		<content> The village has got smaller over the  
 years but not in size. Many people    
 used to work on the farms but         
 machinery (tractors, etc) has taken   
 over. Many young couples came to live 
 for the quiet life in Coberley but    
 found it difficult to adjust so left. 
 The village is very quiet and secluded
 not as it used to be. Now the         
 congregation at the village church is 
 about fifty, a good number, but only  
 five or six are from the village. Now 
 people are not occupied with farms but
 work in Cheltenham, that is those who 
 are not retired and live off their    
 pensions and allowances.              
   The village school has been there   
 for many years. There thirty pupils   
 most of them coming from outside the  
 village. All the old people in the    
 village attended the school whereas   
 now some children go into Cheltenham. </content>
