		<content>     The roads to the farms are long,  
 narrow twisty tracks. The farm        
 buildings have a shelter belt of trees
 to protect them from the winds.       
     The water supply is usually from  
 springs.                              
     The farms are isolated from each  
 other, although the car has reduced   
 this isolation.                       
     Hill farming has no fixed hours of
 work and is best described as a way of
 life.                                 
     The hill farmer is gradually being
 forced to change as more and more     
 visitors come into the country-side   
 and disrupt his life, by leaving gates
 open, parking in gateways and walking 
 across his crops.                     
     Despite this, many farmers welcome
 the visitors, as it reduces the       
 isolation and loneliness of their way 
 of life.                              </content>
