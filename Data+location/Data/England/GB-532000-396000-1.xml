    The area studied on the following  
 pages is predominantly a flat, fenland
 district of{north Lincolnshire}which  
 consists of excellent agricultural    
 land ,with little or no industrial use
 at present or in the recent past.     
                                       
    Present inhabitants of the district
 come from generations of local        
 stock,with the occasional "outsider"  
 having moved into the area from large 
 nearby towns:such people still commute
 daily to their jobs in town.There are 
 no families from other ethnic groups  
 living within the area surveyed. The  
 pace of life here is rather slow, a   
 situation which obviously suits the   
 population, as moving out of the area 
 is almost unknown, unless employment  
 necessitates a move.                  </content>
