		<title>12RAILWAY AT BISHOPS LYDEARD</title>
		<content> The railway first came to Bishops     
 Lydeard in 1862 when a broad guauge   
 line ran from Taunton to Watchet.In   
 1882 the gauge was changed and the    
 line extended northwards to Minehead  
 and at Taunton linked to the main     
 Great Western Railway network.After   
 serving the village well it was closed
 in 1971.However 5 years later it was  
 purchased by the West Somerset Railway
 Company with help from Somerset County
 Council.There are now regular steam   
 and diesel services throughout the    
 year along the 20 miles between       
 Bishops Lydeard and Minehead,being the
 longest independant railway in Great  
 Britain.The track between Bishops     
 Lydeard and Taunton has been retained 
 in the hope that one day trains will  
 again be able to link up with the main
 network instead of having to travel   
 the 5 miles to Taunton by bus.        </content>
