		<title>12A FARMERS LIFE</title>
		<content>    My Dad works on the biggest farm in
 the area. Mr. Chamberlian owns it, but
 he also rents some of the land he     
 farms. The size of the farm is twelve 
 hundred acres. They grow wheat,       
 barley, oil seed rape and grass.      
 There are a hundred and sixty four    
 steers &amp; beef cattle. The breeds are  
 hereford, semintel crosses and        
 charolais. They have four helpers. The
 transport is two large combiners, 8, 2
 wheel drive tractors, 2100 hp 4 wheel 
 tractors, a digger, a crawler, fork   
 lift trucks, large ploughs and drills.
 The sprays they use are fungicides &amp;  
 inscecticides.The fertilisers used are
 nitrogen, potash and phostrogen. The  
 best thing about farming is to work in
 the open air close to nature.The worst
 thing about farming is planning ahead 
 and the weather usually deciding what 
 the farmer does.                      </content>
