		<title>08RYE HILL COMMON</title>
		<content> Before the Second World War,a large   
 part of Rye Hill was Common Land.Much 
 of the nation's food was imported,    
 mostly by sea.During the War,German   
 submarines sank many of the ships     
 carrying food to Britain.With food in 
 short supply,the Government paid Â£2 to
 farmers for every acre(0.4 hectare)   
 farmed.Much grass land was planted    
 with corn,and Common Land (where local
 people could graze animals freely) was
 also ploughed,along with waste land   
 and even playing fields.              
 After the War the Government did not  
 return the lnd but posted notices to  
 say it was for sale:Dorringtons Farm  
 bought most of the Rye Hill area.Only 
 a narrow belt on either side of the   
 Rye Hill road remains common,and a    
 worker at Rivetts tethers 3 or 4      
 heifers on it each day.
