		<title>11Religion in Alresford.</title>
		<content> There is only one type of religious   
 establishment in Alresford, and this  
 is St. Andrews Church (C of E).       
  In 1971 the old church, St. Peters,  
 was burnt down by vandals. St. Andrews
 was built in 1977. During the time    
 when there was no church in the       
 village, the church-hall was used     
 for worship. In 1980 the present      
 Rector came to the church, and since  
 then it has been growing. The         
 electoral role has risen from 45      
 members in 1980 to 123 in 1985. The   
 church organises many of youth        
 activities and weekly house groups,   
 where members of the congregation meet
 for discussion and Bible study. Coffee
 mornings are organised every Friday   
 morning, and youth groups such as     
 Sunday School, Pathfinders and the    
 Young Peoples Fellowship are          
 organised on a weekly basis.          </content>
