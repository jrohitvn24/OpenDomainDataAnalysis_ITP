		<title>04LEE MOOR CHINA CLAY-USES.</title>
		<content> The china clay which is obtained from 
 the Lee Moor area has many uses.Most  
 of the china clay is used as a        
 'filler' for paper.What it does is to 
 fill in the minute gaps between the   
 paper fibres,to provide a good        
 printing surface.Since china clay is  
 often cheaper than wood pulp,it is not
 surprising that the paper industry is 
 the largest user of china clay.Some   
 magazines are about one-fifth clay.   
 More than three-quarters of the china 
 clay produced in the Lee Moor area is 
 used in the making of paper.Some of   
 the better quality clay is used in the
 manufacture of chinaware and porcelain
 products.Some of the clay is used in  
 the manufacture of paints,to help it  
 spread easily and smoothly.It is even 
 used in the manufacture of medicines, 
 cosmetics,toothpastes and soaps.The   
 demand for this china clay is rising. </content>
