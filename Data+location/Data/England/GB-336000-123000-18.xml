		<title>18My Granf's Day 1985</title>
		<content> The day begins when my Granf wakes up 
 and has breakfast, then he goes       
 outside and lets out the three cats   
 and Gypsy the dog and he goes and lets
 out the chickens and he feeds them.   
 After that he milks and feeds the two 
 goats and with the milk from the      
 goats, at 11 o'clock he makes himself 
 and Gran and Uncle Pete, who works    
 there, a cup of tea or coffee. When   
 that is done he goes and collects the 
 eggs from the hens. He takes them in  
 and washes them for when he sells     
 them. Then he goes in and has his     
 dinner and watches the 1 o'clock News.
 After his dinner he goes out and sits 
 in the deck-chair and lets his dinner 
 go down. The paper man arrives and he 
 goes and collects the paper and sits  
 down and reads it and then he goes and
 talks to his next-door-neighbour from 
 the chicken houses.                   </content>
