		<title>10ST. PETERS CHURCH</title>
		<content> There has reputedly been a church on  
 this site since late Roman times.Then 
 there was a Saxon church (700 A.D).   
 The present building is essentially   
 Norman dating from around 1180.Built  
 of local  flint and clunchstone,the   
 church has examples of various types o
 architecture to 1880.The church has 8 
 bells,one of the finest sets in the   
 country.It also holds a set of death  
 helmets.On a pillar near the west door
 is graffiti probably dating from the  
 Reformation, stating the Pope is a    
 knave.As well as monuments to local   
 land-owning families the church also  
 holds monuments to Paul Wentworth, the
 Elizabethan politician,and William    
 Wyndham Grenville,Prime Minister to   
 George III.
