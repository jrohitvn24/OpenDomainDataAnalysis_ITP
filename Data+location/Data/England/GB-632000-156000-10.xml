		<title>10Shopping and Golf -Sandwich</title>
		<content>A survey was carried out by pupils from
the Junior School by interviewing their
parents.Many parents believed that the 
local shops were inadequate for their  
shopping needs and they shopped outside
the town in Deal or Ramsgate.The town  
was further criticised for its lack of 
facilities for teenage children.In     
contrast some of the childrens' parents
were appreciative of the library       
service and the Youth Club.            
***************************************
A notable feature of Sandwich is its   
proximity to four excellent Golf       
Courses,two of which are well known in 
International Golf circles.These are   
the Prince's Golf Club and the Royal   
St. George's at Sandwich Bay where the 
Golf Open Tournament will be held this 
year and roughly 250,000 visitors are  
expected in the week.
