      Most farms extend to between 250 
 and 350 acres, but nowadays comparat_ 
 ively few of the local people are     
 employed on the land.  Until about    
 twenty years ago hop pickers from the 
 Black Country came annually and were  
 housed in 'barracks', but the advent  
 of modern machinery for picking and   
 harvesting and the changes in land use
 have brought about a gradual decline  
 in the number of agricultural workers,
 both on a permanent and casual basis. 
                                       
     Today the casual pickers are those
 who come in their cars to pick fruit  
 and vegetables for home freezing.     
 'Pick-Your-Own' notices sprout along  
 the roadsides and farmers make        
 provision for car parking and for     
 weighing out the picked produce.      </content>
