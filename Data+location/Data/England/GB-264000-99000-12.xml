		<title>12LOCAL HISTORY - NORTH TAWTON</title>
		<content> There was a{ROMAN}settlement at North 
 Tawton called NEMETESTATIO.This was a 
 signal station or fort on the main    
{ROMAN}road from Exeter to Cornwall.   
 NEMET means "the place of the shrine  
 in the wood".The word NYMET appears in
 a number of local placenames.         
 In{NORMAN}times North Tawton appears  
 as TAWETONA and TAWLAND(Domesday Book)
 and later in{1270}as CHEPING TAUTON.  
 The name TAWTON means "farmstead on   
 the silent water"The population at    
 this time was about 600.              
 In{1374}North Tawton had its first    
{Market Charter}together with a three  
 days{Fair}at the{Feast of St.Nicholas}
 (6th.Dec.).The market lapsed about    
 1730 but the Fair survived under      
 different dates until earlier this    
 century by which time it had become   
 a Cattle Fair.
