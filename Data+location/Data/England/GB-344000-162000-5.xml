		<title>05WRINGTON ARCHITECTURE</title>
		<content> THE HEART OF WRINGTON IS THE          
 SHORT, BROAD, HIGH STREET, RUNNING    
 EAST-WEST. ALTHOUGH BUILDING ON EACH  
 SIDE OF THE ROAD IS ALMOST CONTINUOUS 
 THE HOUSES, MANY OF WHICH ARE NOW     
 SHOPS, WERE OBVIOUSLY BUILT           
 INDIVIDUALLY, THOUGH ALL ARE OF THE   
 SAME EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY         
 STYLE. MANY OF THE BUILDINGS ARE      
 TERRACES OF THREE STOREYS WHICH ARE   
 NOW NEATLY PAINTED.                   
 MOST OF THE MORE RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF
 WRINGTON IS ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE
 VILLAGE. IN THIS AREA AND ALSO ON THE 
 NORTHERN SIDE NEAR THE CHAPEL SOME NEW
 HOMES ARE PRESENTLY BEING             
 BUILT. COMMUTER DEVELOPEMENT HAS,     
 THOUGH BEEN LIMITED BECAUSE OF POOR   
 ROAD ACCESS TO THE VILLAGE.           
 TWO OF THE MOST NOTEWORTHY BUILDINGS  
 IN WRINGTON ARE THE PLOUGH INN AND THE
 CHURCH.                               </content>
