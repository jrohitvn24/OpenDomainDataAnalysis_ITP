		<title>13Offwell Church</title>
		<content>   The parish church is dedicated to St
 Mary.  Built of flint and stone, it   
 was built in the 13th century.        
   There is a service every Sunday     
 morning with Evening Prayer once a    
 month.  Usually about 30 people       
 attend.  Bells are rung before all    
 services by six ringers, three from   
 the same family. The church is used   
 for Baptisms, Weddings, Funerals and  
 for school services.                  
   Being the oldest and largest        
 building in the village, it costs a   
 great deal to maintain.  Voluntary    
 contributions from the parishioners   
 are the only source of income.        
   The Rector lives in{Offwell}and is  
 also responsible for the three        
 neighbouring parishes of {Widworthy,  
{Cotleigh }and {Southleigh.
