		<content> We would like to thank all the people 
 mentioned in our investigation for    
 allowing us to come into their homes  
 and for talking to us so freely. Also 
 all the people we stopped in the      
 street. We thank Mr.Brown and         
 Mrs.March, headmaster and headmistress
 of Brandon Junior and Infants School  
 for allowing us use of the premises to
 write up our field studies, the 6th   
 formers who helped us and enjoyed it  
 as much as we did, the B.B.C. for     
 encouraging us to find more about the 
 area we live in and Cheryl Smith and  
 Lisa Willey for typing in all the     
 information. Most of all the 39 second
 year pupils from Durham Johnston      
 School who all live in the area and   
 Mr.Sinclair who grew up there!        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
