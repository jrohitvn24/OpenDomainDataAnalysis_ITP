  Our school is just a new school.It   
 opened in{September 1985}and is       
 increasing all the time.We have people
 from{Japan}who have a special tutor   
 called Mrs Scurfield.We do pottery and
 baking which I enjoy.We have two art  
 areas but at present we only use      
 one.Our headteacher is called Mrs     
 Wilson.My teacher is Mr Atkinson.     
 There are three other teachers, Mrs   
 Phipps,Mrs Clark and Mrs Robinson.We  
 have a library and when there weren't 
 many pupils we had assembly in there. 
  It is a nice school,everything is    
 new.We go to the swimming baths every 
 other week.I enjoy that too.We do     
 Maths, English, Topics, Science(we are
 doing "Frogs"), and Past and Present. 
 There is lots of choice,no one gets   
 bored.
