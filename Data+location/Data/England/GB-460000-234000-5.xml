		<content> In 1985 most of the 1200 hectares of  
 this block are under crops. Wheat and 
 barley occupy about 25% each.In the   
 last 6 years there has been a marked  
 increase in the growing of oil seed   
 rape, which with oats, peas and beans 
 make up abouut 15%.The remaining 35%  
 is mainly grass, some of it temporary 
 ley, some permanent pasture, some     
 improved and a little rough           
 grazing.Most grass remains in the Ouse
 floodplain or in small fields left by 
 old-time farmers.Whereas in 1931 most 
 of the farming was mixed with quite a 
 large proportion of animals,          
 especially sheep,dairy and beef       
 cattle, whilst most families had two  
 pigs for their own use,now a lot of   
 grazing has been ploughed up and only 
 a few specialised flocks and herds    
 remain. Many hedges have been removed 
 to make large arable plots.           </content>
