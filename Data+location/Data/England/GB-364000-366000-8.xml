		<title>08How Winsford Has Changed</title>
		<content>    We interviewed Mrs.Moore and       
 Mrs.Roberts.Both work at High Street  
 C.P.School.They have lived in the area
 for many years.Here are some of the   
 changes they have noticed.            
    Winsford has grown in size and in  
 population.They argue that the        
 provision for entertainment in the    
 town has deteriorated.There used to be
 two cinemas,two dance halls,an open   
 air swimming pool and many more       
 country walks.Most of the old shops   
 have gone since they used to be down  
 the High Street which has been        
 recently re-developed.Both contend    
 that life was better.Apart from public
 houses,most entertainment is to be    
 found outside of the town.{Winsford   
{hospital,}once by the railway         
 station,no longer exists.             
                                       
                                       </content>
