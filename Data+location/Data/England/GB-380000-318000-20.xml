		<content>  The Domesday Survey was undertaken by
two schools in Gnosall.                
  Class 8 of {St. Lawrence First       
School} undertook a great deal of work 
in the local area. They did a survey   
of the shops, talked to local farmers, 
the vicar and the Methodist minister   
and walked along the Shropshire Union  
Canal. They also wrote about their     
interests and hobbies. Mrs. Butlin,    
teacher of Class 8 collated their work.
  Also taking part were pupils of      
{Heron Brook Middle School}. Pupils in 
4L went out on several occasions to    
complete the land cover and amenity    
counts. Together with pupils in 2-1,   
they also interviewed several leading  
members of the local community.        
  Thanks to all for their lively and   
interesting contributions.             
  Mr. and Mrs. B. Oldbury took the     
photographs.                           </content>
