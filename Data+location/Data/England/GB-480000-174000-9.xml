		<content>   {West End}is a small hamlet of about
 twenty houses.  It is about one mile  
 from both Waltham St. Lawrence and    
 Shurlock Row.  The{village school}is  
 in West End.  It was built to replace 
 two small schools in the villages and 
 had to be built in between the two to 
 stop arguments.  When it was built    
 there were only about three houses in 
 West End.                             
                                       
   West End has a{post box}and a{      
{telephone box}.  Near the hamlet is{  
{Woods Yard}which is a very large{Do it
{yourself and timber yard}.  People    
 visit the yard from many miles away   
 and are always having to ask the way  
 there.

 roads in West End every winter.
