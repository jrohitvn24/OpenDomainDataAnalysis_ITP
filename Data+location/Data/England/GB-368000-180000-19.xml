		<title>19HOUSING IN YATE</title>
		<content> In our area the modern houses have a  
 rear entrance for cars.The fronts of  
 the houses do not lead right onto a   
 road.Our roads are all cul de sacs    
 so there is no through traffic.The    
 houses are made of brick and have     
 tiled roofs.They are bigger and much  
 more luxurious.An average house       
 nowadays would probably have a toilet,
 about, three bedrooms,  a bathroom, a 
 living room, a kitchen, and maybe a   
 dining room.With heating costs high,  
 insulation is now very important.Many 
 houses have insulation in their loft, 
 strips of insulation around their     
 doors and insulation between their    
 walls.
