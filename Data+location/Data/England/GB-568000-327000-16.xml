		<title>16Sandringham Cricket Club</title>
		<content> The Cricket Club has the priviledge of
 playing on one of the most picturesque
 grounds in the country. High up beside
 Park House, it looks out over         
 Sandringham Park, which rolls away    
 into the distance.                    
                                       
 A good standard of cricket is played  
 in the North-West Norfolk League and  
 over the last few years, the club has 
 enjoyed its fair share of success.    
                                       
 The ground is maintained by the       
 members who can often be seen on      
 summer evenings  with mowers, rakes   
 and watering-cans preparing the pitch 
 for the next match                    
                                       
 The charming pavilion was opened by   
 King George VI in 1952.
