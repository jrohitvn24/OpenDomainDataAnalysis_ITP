		<title>13An Interview with Pensioner</title>
		<content>      I was told that the pit had been 
 the main industry at Scotland Gate.   
 There was more than one pit.  They are
 closed now.  A pit tub was erected in 
 1984 to mark the site of the Ann      
 Colliery.  The Colliery was sunk in   
 1857 and 9OO men worked there.  The   
 pit closed in 1966 and was reclaimed  
 by Northumberland County Council in   
 1974.                                 
      The clayhole was behind the big  
 school.  The workers got clay for the 
 brickworks  there.  It is a tip now.  
 I go there to collect tadpoles and    
 fish.  I can see the remains of an old
 colliery nearby.  There is a burn next
 to a railway line.  People used to    
 bowl eggs down hill and have picnics  
 there.  There was a cinema but now    
 there is a car park.                  
      A lot of things have changed in  
 Choppington.                          </content>
