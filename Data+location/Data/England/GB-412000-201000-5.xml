		<content>   {Fairford Cottage Hospital}is       
 Gloucestershire's smallest hospital.  
 There was a Rural Hospital in cottages
 in Park Street from l867 - l887, and  
 the building of the Cottage Hospital  
 in The Croft marked{Queen Victoria's  
{Golden Jubilee.}  Originally of 8     
 beds, the hospital once had its own   
 operating theatre.   Extensions and   
 modernisation have increased the size 
 and scope of the hospital to l5 beds, 
 a casualty treatment room, and Day    
 Hospital facilities to which some 24  
 patients are brought in each week from
 their homes for physiotherapy and     
 medical treatment.   The hospital is  
 on a single ground floor plan and is  
 the only substantial red-brick        
 building in this Cotswold stone town. 
 A{League of Friends}was formed in     
 l97O and has raised some Â£6O,OOO for  
 modernising and equipping the hospital</content>
