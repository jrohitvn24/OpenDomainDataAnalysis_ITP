		<content> The South Downs are traversed by      
 several well kept footpaths of great  
 antiquity which are under the control 
 of the East Sussex County Council who 
 have had hunting gates and stiles     
 erected by the Manpower Services      
 Commission.  The South Downs Ranger   
 Service helps keep the paths clear on 
 a voluntary unpaid basis at weekends. 
 A blue acorn painted on the gates and 
 stiles indicates it is a long-distance
 footpath.  There are also licensed    
 paths which mean the public has       
 permission to walk on the path but if 
 the landowner finds this privilege is 
 being abused he has the right to close
 the path by giving three months'      
 notice to the County Council.
