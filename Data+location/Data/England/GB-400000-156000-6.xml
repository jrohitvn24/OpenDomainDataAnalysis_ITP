		<content> DENTISTRY IN THE EIGHTIES HAS SEEN A  
 CONSIDERABLE ADVANCE IN TECHNICAL     
 SKILLS,IN PART HELPING TO COMPENSATE  
 THE PROFESSION FOR ITS                
 DISSATISFACTION WITH THE AILING       
 NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE. THE LAST     
 DECADE PROVIDED DENTISTS WITH A BREAK 
 FROM REPETETIVE FILLING APPOINTMENTS, 
 MAINLY DUE TO MAJOR ADVANCES IN DENTAL
 TECHNIQUES AND GREATER PUBLIC         
 AWARENESS OF ORAL HYGIENE.            
 SOPHISTICATED CROWN AND BRIDGE WORK   
 HAVE INCREASED IN DEMAND AND THE      
 INTRODUCTION OF WHITE COLOURED FILLING
 MATERIAL WILL LEAD TO THE EVENTUAL    
 REPLACEMENT OF UNSIGHTLY AMALGAM      
 RESTORATIONS. AS TO THE FUTURE        
 VACCINES DESIGNED TO PREVENT CARIES   
 WILL ENABLE DENTAL DECAY TO BE        
 ELIMINATED. GREATER CONCERN TO THE    
 PROFESSION IS THE DANGER OF BLOOD BORN
 VIRUSES.                              </content>
