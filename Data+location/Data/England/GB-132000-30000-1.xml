		<title>01Cape Cornwall</title>
		<content> Cape Cornwall is 15-20 minutes walk   
 west of St Just. About a mile from the
 shore are two huge rocks known as The 
 Brisons which were the cause of many  
 shipwrecks in the past. An arduous    
 swim from the shore to the rocks is an
 annual event in July. Below the Cape  
 is a cove which shelters a terrace of 
 cottages formerly used by coastguards.
 Today the Coastguard Lookout is only  
 used on occasions of "Casualty Risk   
 Watch"- perhaps during severe weather.
 From the top of the Cape there is a   
 magnificent view of the rolling       
 Atlantic. The top of the Cape is      
 marked by a reminder of the once      
 thriving tin industry - a derelict    
 19th century mine ventilation shaft.  
 Many artists from all over the world  
 are drawn to this part of the coast   
 because of the extraordinary "Atlantic
 light".....................Beautiful!!</content>
