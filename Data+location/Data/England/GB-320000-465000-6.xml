		<content> Some of the remaining land may be     
 needed in  the future but,for the time
 being,part will be landscaped and the 
 rest returned to farming.             
                                       
 At the terminal the gas will first be 
 passed through a series of pipes      
 called slug-catchers .The pipes are   
 there to catch slugs of oily liquid   
 known as condensate.They will be piped
 to storage tanks at Barrow docks and  
 will then be removed by ship.         
                                       
 Other processing at the terminal will 
 include drying  the gas by            
 refrideration and adding  chemicals to
 give it  a gassy smell.Natural gas,   
 which is mostly methane has no natural
 smell of its own.Finally the quality  
 of the gas,including temperature and  
 pressure,will be checked before the   
 gas is passed to the onshore pipeline.</content>
