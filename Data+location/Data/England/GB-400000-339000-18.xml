		<content>Most of the area is agricultural with  
the emphasis on Dairy Farming.There are
several large dairy farms with Friesian
cattle (black and white) being the     
chief stock.On the western edge of our 
area is a Milk Marketing A.I. Centre   
with about 20 bulls.The farmers sell   
their milk to the Co-op dairy at Fole  
(3 miles to the east).The crops are    
mainly silage and hay although some    
barley is grown.                       
Winnothdale is an area of small        
holdings some of which are too small to
support the family so other work is    
undertaken (one farmer is also a       
plumber).                              
The farmers have lost income because of
E.E.C. laws(1985) restricting the      
amount of milk they can produce.
