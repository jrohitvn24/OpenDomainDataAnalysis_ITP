		<content> The biggest{plantion}is the           
{Trelowarren Plantation}which is part  
 of the{Trelowarren Estate.The Vivienne
 family have owend it for over{600}    
 years.The wood was used for making    
{furniture,building and fire wood.   } 
 The trees are mainly{deciduous.}Many  
 of the trees are elms and some of them
 had to be cut down because they had   
{Dutch Elm Disease.}When this happened 
 new trees were planted but they were  
 conifers instead of deciduous         
 trees.{Conifers}grow quickly and don't
 get Dutch Elm Disease.                
                                       
 Several areas in the D.block have had 
 lots of coniferous trees planted by   
 the{Forestry Commission.}Most of the  
 trees that we saw in the D .block were
 in the plantations but there were some
 trees around the{edges of fields  }   
 especially in the{valleys.   }        </content>
