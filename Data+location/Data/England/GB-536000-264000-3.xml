		<content>   Wednesday 26 June , 1120 a.m.{      
{  In Woodside}it is quiet. Leaves     
 rustle, birds twitter. A Mercedes     
 lorry approaches, followed by a       
 Peugeot car and a Toyota 4x4 pick_up. 
 Not one is British. A Lynx helicopter 
 from the airfield gains height above. 
{  In the High Street }cars come and go
 past Did_Dell's shop. The 155 bus in  
 its new blue livery drops a couple at 
 the Old People's flats. An army       
 Land-Rover passes and Tracy's father  
 waves. Tracy waves back, a little     
 sadly: he is just leaving for Canada. 
 An Army Air Corps helicopter flies by.
  {Opposite Colesfield}the wind sways  
 the oilseed rape, beaten into tangled 
 clumps  by recent rain. Mrs Alsop     
 pauses, and comes over to chat. A     
 sparrow hops across the road as a red 
 car leaves Colesfield. Above  flies an
 army helicopter.....                  </content>
