		<title>06SANDY MARKET</title>
		<content>  THERE IS A MARKET EVERY FRIDAY AND IT
 IS A VERY BUSY MARKET. IT IS HELD IN  
 THE CAR PARK BEHIND THE SUPERMARKET.  
  WE DID TWO SURVEYS IN THE MARKET. THE
 1ST SURVEY WAS TO FIND OUT WHERE THE  
 PEOPLE WHO SHOP IN THE MARKET COME    
 FROM AND THE 2ND WAS TO FIND OUT WHAT 
 STALLS ARE IN THE MARKET.             
  MANY PEOPLE IN THE MARKET COME FROM  
 SANDY BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE COME FROM   
 THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES. THERE WERE  
 SOME PEOPLE WHO HAD COME FROM         
 COVENTRY.                             
  THERE ARE LOTS OF STALLS AND IT WAS  
 VERY COLOURFUL. LOTS OF THE STALLS    
 SOLD CLOTHES. YOU CAN ALSO BUY FRUIT, 
 VEGETABLES, MEAT, FISH, SHOES, TOYS,  
 RECORDS, JEWELLERY AND CARDS.         
  THE REASONS PEOPLE USE THE MARKET ARE
 BECAUSE IT IS CHEAPER, THERE IS LOTS  
 OF VARIETY AND YOUCAN WALK AROUND     
 LOOKING AT THE STALLS.                </content>
