		<title>16Paris Farm - East Malling</title>
		<content> Paris farm,covering 140 acres, is one 
 of the best-known farms in the area.  
 During the "Pick your own" season, it 
 is always AA signposted. Fruit crops  
 grown are strawberries, raspberries,  
 gooseberries, apples, pears and plums.
 Vegetables include broad &amp; French     
 beans, cauliflower, spring greens,    
 marrows, curly kale, courgettes,      
 marrows, calabrese and rhubarb. One   
 full-time and three casual workers are
 employed. During the summer, between  
 10 and 20 pickers are employed. Lately
 there has been a shortage of pickers. 
 Produce goes to supermarkets,  whole -
 salers and retailers. There is a farm 
 shop but many people prefer "pick your
 own". 1985 has not been a good year   
 for crops. Frost in Jan-Feb killed    
 many of the vegetables. A wet June    
 damaged the strawberries - they       
 ripened too slowly or rotted.         </content>
