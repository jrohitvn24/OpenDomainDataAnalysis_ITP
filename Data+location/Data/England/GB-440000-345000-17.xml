		<title>17OCCUPATIONS IN LOSCOE</title>
		<content> Loscoe offers many different types of 
 work. The opencast which covers a     
 large amount of area employs quite a  
 few workers. Although this is good as 
 regards occupations it affects living 
 conditions and wild life suffers.     
 There are several factories in the    
 Loscoe area including a brick factory.
 This is unhealthy because of the dust 
 it deposits. Rydes butcher factory    
 employs many people who deliver around
 the country and actually prepare the  
 meat. The refuse tip does not offer a 
 lot of jobs but it is always in use.  
 The village has quite a few shops an  
 three pubs which gives local people a 
 form of employment. Loscoe is an area 
 that offers few jobs for the people   
 in the area, and most have to travel  
 further afield for work, though the   
 local development plan offers some    
 hope for the future.                  </content>
