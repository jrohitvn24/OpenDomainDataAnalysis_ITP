		<content>   Fairfield's, situated on the Priors 
 Court Road, is a garden centre selling
 additional items, such as food. It    
 also rents out land from its 9 or 10  
 acres to other companies, such as     
 Kalehurst and Hills who sell their    
 own related items. The company is now 
 fifteen years old.                    
   Most people who answered our survey 
 thought that the service at Fairfields
 is good. Sunday is the busier day of  
 the weekend, and the most popular day 
 of the week for customers. The car    
 park at Fairfields holds 350 cars.    
   Most of those surveyed shopped for  
 plants, and although very few thought 
 the centre needed to be expanded,     
 several people expressed a wish for a 
 coffee shop and a play area.          
   The owner of Fairfields is Lord     
 Norry.
