		<content> The village contains various types of 
 houses and cottages dating from the   
 15th century to the present day.      
 There is no Manor House, but          
 Cattistock Lodge is a manor-type house
 due for conversion, near the modern   
 rectory.   There are more houses and  
 bungalows on the approach road and in 
 Kennel Lane.   The former farm        
 buildings have been converted into    
 four houses and a bungalow.           
 In Duck Street are more houses, a     
 bungalow and the Pound House.   The   
 former rectory, now converted into    
 flats, is in South Drive, together    
 with several bungalows.   The former  
 army camp site is an estate of council
 houses and bungalows.   The old       
 primary school is now four houses.    
 High Street has houses, shop, garage  
 and a new estate of bungalows.
