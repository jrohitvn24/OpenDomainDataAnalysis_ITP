		<title>13LANDSCAPE IN CRANAGE AREA</title>
		<content>     Looking across our area you would 
 notice that it is very flat and lush  
 green over a large part.The area is   
 covered with hedgerows and small areas
 of woodland. These have mostly        
 deciduous trees and a wide variety of 
 birds and animals live there.         
     The rivers Dane and Croco flow    
 through the area where locals can fish
 for fresh water fish. The land near   
 the Dane is only 30 feet above        
 sea-level. The land rises steeply to  
 61 feet where the village of Holmes   
 Chapel has been developed away from   
 the danger of flooding.               
      The M6 runs through a deep       
 cutting in the north of the block with
 embankments on either side. These have
 been re-landscaped to fit in with the 
 surrounding countryside.              
       Away from the main roads it is  
 very quiet and peaceful.              </content>
