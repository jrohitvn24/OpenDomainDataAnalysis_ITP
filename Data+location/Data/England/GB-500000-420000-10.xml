		<content> One of the things that makes Barton   
 and the surrounding area attractive is
 the number of mature trees within this
 area.In the last year,unfortunately,a 
 lot of trees have had to be felled    
 because of{Dutch Elm Disease.}The     
 places where the felling of trees is  
 noticed most are the park,Stivey Hill 
 and Horkstow Road.                    
  The trees which were felled were     
 about 70 feet tall and about 250 years
 old.The trees which were chopped down 
 were replaced by saplings.They were   
 planted in{National Tree Planting     
{Week.}The new trees were about 5 years
 old and 3 feet tall.Some of the new   
 trees have unfortunately been         
 vandalised.                           
  The children of area 5 at{Bowmandale 
{School}have planted,in the school     
 grounds,50 trees that they received   
 from the Forestry Commission.         </content>
