		<title>15Wivelsfield - Housing</title>
		<content> The majority of the homes in the area 
 are{owner occupied.}The houses vary   
 greatly between very old cottages and 
 modern houses.{House prices}are       
 amongst the highest in the country.   
                                       
 A number of pre-fabricated{council    
{houses}with structural faults were    
 recently demolished in Wivelsfield    
 Green and the local council has now   
 built an attractive small estate      
 to replace them.                      
                                       
                                       
 It is unlikely that{planning          
{permission}would be given for any     
 large scale development in the area.  
 The council has a policy of allowing  
 'infil' only. The small amount of land
 left, which can be built on, sells at 
 a premium.                            
                                       </content>
