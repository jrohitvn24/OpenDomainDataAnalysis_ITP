		<title>17FRISKNEY SCHOOL IN THE PAST</title>
		<content> The present school was founded as a   
 National School in 1860. There had    
 been a school since 1815. The         
 Schoolmaster and his wife were paid   
 Â£52 p.a. from the Church "poor land"  
 rents. The new school cost Â£760 of    
 which Â£412 was raised by public       
 subscription and the land was given   
 by the Vicar the Rev. Booth. Of the   
 2 rooms,the large one was divided by a
 partition. There were 7 standards of  
 at least 40 children each with 3      
 teachers and 1 pupil teacher. The     
 children sat at long wooden desks with
 8 to 10 at each desk. There was no    
 sanitation and heating was by open    
 fires or tortoise stoves. In 1960 the 
 school was extensively modernised and 
 extended with 7 classrooms, offices   
 inside toilets and a canteen. In 1959 
 children transferred at 11 years to   
 secondary modern or grammar schools.  </content>
