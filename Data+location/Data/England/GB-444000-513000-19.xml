 The A19 road is a busy trunk road     
 connecting the Tyne Tunnel with       
 Doncaster, passing near Sunderland,   
 Peterlee, Billingham, Thornaby,       
 Stockton-on-Tees, Middlesbough        
 Thirsk and York. North of Thirsk it is
 a two lane dual carriageway.To travel 
 along the A174 the trafic on the A19  
 must go along a slip road,which angles
 away from the road to the left.The    
 slip road leads to a roundabout where 
 vehicles can change direction safely. 
 this roundabout is constructed between
 the supports of the bridge holding up 
 the A19.Traffic from the A174 may     
 join the A19 by driving along a slip  
 road and filtering into a safe gap in 
 the traffic already on the road.
