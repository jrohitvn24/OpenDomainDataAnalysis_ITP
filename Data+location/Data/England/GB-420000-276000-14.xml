		<content> In the last 20 years Balsall Common   
 village has changed from a small      
 agricultural community to having      
 several large estates. The people     
 living on these estates have          
 occupations like busines executives   
 and they commute to cities like       
 Birmingham or Coventry.               
 A typical example of such an estate is
{ Lark Rise.}It surrounds Balsall      
 Common Primary School and is near to  
 the Heart of England Comprehensive    
 School. On the Lark Rise Estate there 
 are hundreds of large detached houses,
 many with 4 bedrooms and 2 garages.   
 Some of the houses are close together 
 with fairly small gardens.            
 Where the Lark Rise Estate stands now,
 there was once only fields. It is hard
 to imagine that a cow could have once 
 stood where your living room is now!
