		<content> The{Shell Group}is a club for people  
 who go to Sunday School at Hayle      
 Methodist Church. We meet every       
 Wednesday at 6.30pm. When you get     
 there you pay 10p. We play football   
 until everybody arrives. There are    
 three leaders who organise the games. 
 The most popular games are{Hockey and 
{Dodge Ball.}Hockey is a game that you 
 play using a newspaper ball and two   
 hollow tubes as sticks. Dodge Ball is 
 exactly as it sounds you have to dodge
 the ball. Half way through the evening
 we have a cup of squash and a biscuit.
 Then we gather around the piano and   
 sing songs. The Shell Group gives     
{concerts}in different parts of the    
 county. Our meetings break up at
