 The original village is now called Old
 Costessey, as a lot of the land       
 between Old Costessey and the A47     
 (Norwich to King's Lynn) road is now  
 the most westerly suburb of Norwich,  
 called New Costessey.                 
                                       
 Costessey Hall, now a ruin surrounded 
 by a private golf club, was the seat  
 of Lord Stafford, whose family name   
 was Jerningham.                       
                                       
 Another local family was the Gurney   
 family, a famous Quaker family who    
 lived at Earlham Hall.  Gurney's Bank 
 was one of the predecessors of        
 Barclay's Bank, in Norwich.  Elizabeth
 Gurney married Joseph Fry, and became 
 a great prison reformer.
