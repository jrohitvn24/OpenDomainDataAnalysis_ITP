		<content> A great deal of this area is rough    
 farm grazing and there are many small 
 farms.The block lies in part of the   
{Somerset Levels,}an ancient peat      
 marsh which is over{6000 years}old!The
 peat has a great ability to preserve  
 most things and so the area is well   
 used by archaeologists_especially     
 famous is the{Sweet Track.}Shapwick   
 village is included with its          
 collection of fine old houses.The     
 village school has recently           
 closed(end of 1984).Apart from the    
 peat works(Fisons) and the rough      
 grazing, there is also a great deal of
 haymaking in the area.The narrow lanes
 are often busy with the huge combines 
 which annually arrive to work in the  
 fields. Also of interest is the       
{Shapwick Heath Nature Reserve,}a large
 protected area used to develop and    
 study wildlife.                       </content>
