		<title>07YOUNG PEOPLE IN LEWES</title>
		<content>{"Lewes is short of things to do",}said
 all young people we questioned. Scouts
 and Guides are active, with outdoor   
 opportunities, camping and community  
 service. So are St.John's Ambulance,  
 YMCA, many sports clubs, Lewes Boys'  
 Club. But these do not fill all needs.
      The Coffee Bar closed after      
 several months' popularity for lack of
 funds to pay helpers. Cuts in the     
 County{Youth Service}keeps the Boys'  
 Club chronically short of funds for   
 maintenance and staffing. Commercial  
 firms will not fulfil unprofitable    
 needs of young people. The Odeon      
 Cinema closed in the l960s. Pubs are  
 no answer.                            
      There are hopes for an indoor    
 Sports Hall and covered swimming pool 
{-eventually!.}But until then, many    
 young people will make the trip into  
 Brighton for entertainment and leisure</content>
