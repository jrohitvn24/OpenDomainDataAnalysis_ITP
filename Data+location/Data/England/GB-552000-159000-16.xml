   The Primary School is in the High   
Street and is a mixture of buildings   
from the 1870s to the 1970s which house
at present about  240 children. Their  
ages range from rising fives to eleven 
plus and they are catered for in eight 
classes. The grounds are pleasant with 
a fine chestnut tree in the playground.
A heated, enclosed swimming pool of 6m.
by 15m. is very popular and swimming,  
with table-tennis are favourite out-of 
-school activities.                    
   The Headmaster has been at the      
school for ten years and most members  
of the staff are long-serving. A       
kitchen at the front of the building   
provides school lunches and the        
caretaker, school secretary, five lunch
time supervisors , a Cook-Supervisor,  
and kitchen assistants make up the     
staff.                                 </content>
