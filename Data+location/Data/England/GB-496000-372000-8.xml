		<content> The buildings in which the museum is  
 housed were erected in 1856 as the    
 headquarters of the Loyal North       
 Militia.  They became the headquarters
 of Lincolnshire Yeomanry until it was 
 separated in 1918.  They were then    
 used by the Territorial Army and      
 others until acquired by the Lincs.   
 Association in the 1960's. The site is
 known as the Old Barracks to differ it
 from the New or Sobroan Barracks built
 for the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment   
 further north on Burton Road. The most
 remarkable feature of the gatehouse is
 the vaulted brick ceiling giving a    
 honeycomb appearance.  At the back of 
 the museum is a row of cottages       
 erected as part of the barracks, and  
 opposite them is Ellis' Mill on Mill  
 Road.
