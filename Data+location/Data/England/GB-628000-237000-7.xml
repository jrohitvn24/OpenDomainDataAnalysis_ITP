		<content> Tree creepers and Gold crests abound  
 and almost ever house in Falkenham has
 it's House Martins. Pheasants are     
 bread at nearby Kirton Lodge and at   
 Capel hall farm. There are English and
 French partridge but the former are in
 decline.                              
 The fish in King's Fleet consist of   
 Rudd, Roach, Perch, Tench, Pike, Carp 
 and Eels.                             
 The small areas of woodland are mainly
 deciduous.Dutch Elm disease has taken 
 its toll of mature Elm trees but many 
 have young shoots sprouting from the  
 base. Some rare specimens of Black    
 Willow are being matured by residents 
 in Falkenham. There are Tree          
 Preservation Orders on the Cedar of   
 labanon in front of Falkenham Hall and
 also on a group of trees in the garden
 of the Old Vicarage at Falkenham
