 style that reflects the rural farming 
 community - main meals are generally  
 taken at midday or from 4.30 to 6 pm, 
 cooked variously by electricity or on 
 an oil-fired or solid fuel Rayburn or 
 Aga, which usually also provides some 
 form of central heating. Milk is deli-
 vered 3 times a week to most houses &amp; 
 half have bread,meat &amp; fish deliveries
 also. 75% of the houses have a freezer
 &amp; freeze vegetables &amp; fruit plus some 
 bulk meat &amp; cooked foods. Main{shop-  
{ping}is generally done{weekly}by car  
 in{Torrington}or{Hatherleigh}with     
{monthly}trips to{Bideford &amp; Barnstaple
 for bigger supermarkets, but most     
 people use the village Post Office &amp;  
 Store weekly, where they can also     
 collect their pensions &amp; allowances.  
 Tankers deliver heating oil &amp; LPG and 
 both wood &amp; coal merchants deliver.   </content>
