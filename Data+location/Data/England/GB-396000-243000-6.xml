		<title>06Farming - Loss of Landwork</title>
		<content> Although the{Vale}had all the         
 advantages of climate, soils,         
 transport services and markets, the   
 field crops are now grown more        
 economically with modern mechanised   
 methods on the large acreages in      
 Lincolnshire and the Fens. In{Vale}   
 villages, like ours, this means that  
 landwork locally is no longer         
 available and work must be found in   
 shops and industry in nearby towns. It
 does seem a pity that in an area with 
 so many positive advantages and back  
 up services, as well as{Pershore      
{College,}that horticulture is not a   
 more important subject in the local   
 High Schools.The industry needs young 
 people with brains and energy, to     
 train and use modern techniques, to   
 compete effectively with those sending
 imports into the U.K. from other      
 E.E.C. countries.                     </content>
