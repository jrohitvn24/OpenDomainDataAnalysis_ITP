		<content>   Most of the buses in this area run  
 through{Chadwell}and on to the        
{hospital}at Orsett. Five run through  
 Chadwell and three go through{Linford 
 and{East Tilbury,}but only one to {   
{West Tilbury.}                        
 There is only one train route         
 :-Southend to Fenchurch Street. It    
 stops at East Tilbury, but although it
 goes through, it does not stop at West
 Tilbury.There is a level-crossing at  
 both places but the West Tilbury      
 station was closed about 18 years ago.
   The main method of getting around in
 the area is by car. There are no new  
 roads,many winding country ones, and  
 mainly residential ones.Certainly, for
 the residents of West Tilbury a car   
 has become a necessity.
