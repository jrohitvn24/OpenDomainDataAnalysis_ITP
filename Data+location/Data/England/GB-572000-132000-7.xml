		<title>07BEDGEBURY FOREST</title>
		<content>   This forms one of the largest single
 blocks of woodland in S.E. England,   
 straddling the county boundary of Kent
 and E. Sussex, totalling 970 hectares.
   Before 1924 when it was acquired by 
 the Forestry Commission it was part of
 the Crown Estates, managed as mainly  
 broadleaved woodland with a large part
 under chestnut coppice and worked on a
 15-20 year rotation.                  
   The forest now consists of 78%      
 conifers and 22% hardwoods producing  
 an average volume of about 4200 cubic 
 metres of timber per year. The produce
 is sold standing and markets include  
 saw logs for building, pulpwood,      
 mining timber and fencing material.   
   The forest today has a wide appeal  
 to the public.  Recreational pursuits 
 include riding, orienteering, wildlife
 and environmental studies.  Adjacent  
 to the forest block is the Pinetum.   </content>
