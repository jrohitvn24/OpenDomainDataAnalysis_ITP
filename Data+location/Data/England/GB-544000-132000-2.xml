		<title>02HISTORY - ASHDOWN FOREST</title>
		<content>   The Forest consists of 6400 acres of
 heathland with some woodland, is open 
 to the public and administered by a   
 Board of Conservators. It was formed  
 from the Lancaster Great Park made by 
 John of Gaunt in 1372. This park was  
 surrounded by a bank and Pale, still  
 traceable today.                      
   It was a Royal Game Park managed by 
 foresters and keepers, and entered by 
 gates where settlements and Iron      
 workings arose and commoner's rights  
 were established.                     
   By 1657 management had ceased, most 
 of the trees felled for the iron      
 industry and the deer gone.  Much of  
 the land was later sold or leased     
 which interfered with the commoners   
 ancient privileges.  In the 19th      
 century a High Court case resulted in 
 an Act of Parliament allowing public  
 access. This was confirmed in 1974.   </content>
