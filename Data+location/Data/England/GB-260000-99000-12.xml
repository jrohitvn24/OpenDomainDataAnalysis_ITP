		<title>12Sampford-Britain in Bloom</title>
		<content>  The village has been entering the    
{Britain in Bloom Competition}for      
 fifteen years.Firstly in the Regional 
 Section,for the South West. Last year 
 a new section for{Small Villages}was  
 begun and Sampford won.This enabled   
 the village to take part this year,   
 1985,in the International competition 
 'Entente Floral'The winner of which   
 will be announced in September,in     
 Switzerland. We understand that many  
 people from the village plan to be at 
 the Prize giving.                     
 One of the Judges was quoted as having
 counted the number of flower          
 containers scattered about the village
 as numbering 603.4 for every man,woman
 and child in the village.The success  
 of the village in the competition has 
 certainly engendered a feeling of     
 community spirit,providing that one   
 enjoys gardening,of course.           </content>
