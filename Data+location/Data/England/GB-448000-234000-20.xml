		<title>20Pride in King's Sutton</title>
		<content>    All the people we met seemed to    
 like living in King's Sutton.   They  
 found it a friendly place and most of 
 them enjoyed using the village shops. 
 There is a good choice of shopping    
 for a village.                        
   The whole village looks well cared  
 for and they are proud of the lovely  
 old part of the village, the          
 play-ground and the sports-fields     
 and they take a pride in keeping it   
 all tidy.                             
    We thought there was a lot to do in
 the village: many Evening Classes as  
 well as several clubs and groups run  
 by volunteers; something for everyone.

    This part of the Project was       
 prepared by the girls of the sixth    
 form of Overthorpe Hall Preparatory   
 School.
