		<title>09Acocks Green Carnival</title>
		<content> On the first Saturday in July each    
year a carnival is held in Acocks      
Green. The Carnival Committee's purpose
is to provide entertainment and the    
opportunity for community and other    
voluntary groups to raise funds. Last  
year a record profit of seven hundred  
pounds was made by the carnival        
committee itself and all of the        
stallholders were pleased with their   
takings.                               
 I was the princess in the Carnival. I 
rode in a pony and trap with the       
carnival queen, Karen Humphries. The   
procession began at 1.15 p.m. and we   
arrived at the Carnival Ground just    
before 2.00 p.m. I helped the Carnival 
Queen to present the Fancy Dress prizes
and then we watched the displays in the
main arena. These included Majorettes, 
Keep Fit, Air Cadets and The Westerners
who wore American Civil War costumes.  </content>
