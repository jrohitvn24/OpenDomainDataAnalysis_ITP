{_____________________                 
    The  above   was  formed   with   a
 membership  of  approximately 30  when
 the Village Hall opened in 1972.      
    The club includes people from  a  3
 mile    radius,    including     Brant
 Broughton,   Barnby   and  Coddington.
 These  members  have  had  connections
 with  the  village  at   one  time  or
 another and several of the older  ones
 attended the old Beckingham School.   
    Although members are mainly  senior
 citizens single people of the  younger
 age group are  welcome  together  with
 widows and widowers. Meetings are held
 once a month with the main  activities
 being  whist, dominoes and the popular
 game  of  today, Bingo. Three  outings
 are arranged in the summer months also
 a  dinner  in the New Year. Membership
 has remained at around 30/35.         </content>
