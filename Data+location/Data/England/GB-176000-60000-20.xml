		<content> 97 pupils (aged 7-11) gathered the    
 information about the Crantock/Pentire
 area and held some 70 interviews over 
 a period of 3.5 days.  We were all    
 pleased with the way in which both    
 residents and visitors helped us.     
 Everyone was interested and very coop-
 erative - there was only 1 who was too
 busy!!!  The National Trust Warden was
 very helpful and spent 2 full mornings
 out and about with us.  Besides learn-
 ing about the wildlife and wildflowers
 of the area we also learnt how he     
 maintains paths, stiles and walls and 
 how the Trust looks after the sand-   
 dunes to stop them 'burying' Crantock 
 village.  32 parents drove us around -
 and were amazed at what they learnt ! 
  - and the amount of information we   
 collected.  We enjoyed the project and
 are looking forward to following up   
 much of the interesting information.  </content>
