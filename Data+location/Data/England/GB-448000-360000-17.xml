		<title>17Emergency Services.</title>
		<content>     Our area has three emergency      
 services. They are the Fire Brigade,  
 the Police and the Ambulance service. 
 You can contact them by telephone by  
 dialling 999. There is no charge for  
 this call. We have an Ambulance       
 Station in the area which is situated 
 next to the hospital. It houses about 
 twnty ambulance vehicles. Mansfield   
 also has a Police Station and a Fire  
 Station. There is a large tower behind
 the Fire Station which the firemen use
 for practicing using both ladders and 
 hydraulic platforms. All of the three 
 emergency services often come into    
 schools to talk to the children amd   
 demonstrate different aspects of their
 work.
