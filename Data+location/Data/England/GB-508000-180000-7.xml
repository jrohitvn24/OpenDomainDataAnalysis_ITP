		<content>  Last week we went out on Yeading     
 Lane. We did a traffic survey. We     
 counted the cars and trucks.          
                                       
  It gets busy from 7 am onwards and   
 does not quieten down until 10 pm.    
                                       
  There are houses on both side of the 
 road. There is a Zebra crossing       
 outside our school (Yeading Primary). 
 There is a policeman or lollypop lady 
 at the crossing.  Their job is to     
 supervise children and adults crossing
 the road.                             
                                       
  There are many accidents each year on
 Yeading Lane. People use it as a fast 
 road and forget the 40 mph speed      
 limit.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
