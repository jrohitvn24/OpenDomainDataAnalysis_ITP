		<title>14FISHING  IN  SW.BOGNOR REGIS</title>
		<content> There are two kinds of{fishermen}to be
 seen in the area.{Commercial fishermen
 are to be found by the{Pier}and at    
{Gray's Beach.}It is an unwritten rule 
 that only these fishermen are allowed 
 to fish in these spots.They fish about
 6-10km out at sea.Each fisherman has a
 5.6m,fibre glass boat powered by a    
 10h.p outboard motor.Their catch      
 varies from day to day and from season
 to season.In the summer they mainly   
 catch{shellfish and lobsters}and in   
 the winter{white fish.}They sell their
 catch to local restaurants or on the  
 sea-front to passers-by.One fisherman 
 has been there for fifty years and his
 family before him.Although he had     
 enjoyed his job he would not recommend
 it as the catches are now too small   
 and as it is becoming too commercial. 
{Non-commercial fishermen}pay 50p to   
 fish off the{Pier.                    </content>
