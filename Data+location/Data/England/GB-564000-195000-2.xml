		<content>{ MOUNTNESSING HALL FARM.}Type of farm.
   The farm is typical of the area;    
 mainly{arable,}but with some          
{livestock}_a herd of about 200. They  
 are used for milk and beef, the former
 are Friesians, the latter being a     
 cross between Friesians and Herefords.
 Half the herd would be calves, the    
 other half remained until 2\ years    
 old. The soil is heavy, mainly London 
 clay. Drainage pipes have been laid   
 over an extensive area at a depth of  
 3'. The greatest hazard the farm faces
 is the climate.                       
{Machinery                             
   The farm owns its machinery, having 
 some six tractors of varying power.   
 The heaviest is needed to deal with   
 the clay soil. Lighter ones are used  
 for sowing. There is an irrigation    
 machine, and tankers (diesel) which   
 are sent to refuel the tractors.      </content>
