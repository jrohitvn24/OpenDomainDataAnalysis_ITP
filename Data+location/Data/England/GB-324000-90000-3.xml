		<title>03     Colyford Village</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
   {Colyford}is another small village  
 not far from Seaton. There is a Post  
 Office store and Butchery. Also in    
 Colyford there is a Filling Station   
 that sells petrol, motoring equipment,
 sweets, ice-creams, etc. Again there  
 is hardly any transport to Seaton     
 except for the Axe Valley Mini Travel 
 and the Tramway. The people of        
 Colyford also rely on holiday traffic 
 as there are three restaurants in     
 Colyford. The Landlord of the White   
 Hart Inn is very concerned, as people 
 use his toilets without going in the  
 Bar, because his toilets are the only 
 ones on the main road between         
 Lyme Regis and Sidford.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
