		<title>05OPINIONS ABOUT OUR AREA</title>
		<content> There are some good points about      
 living in Cradley.There are lots of   
 friendly people and once you have been
 living there for quite a while it's a 
 very nice place.Cradley comes under   
 Dudley Council.In Cradley we are near 
 to large towns like Dudley,           
 Wolverhampton and Birmingham which are
 useful for shopping.We're also near to
 beautiful countryside like Kinver,    
 Clent,Walton and the Lickey Hills.    
    There are quite a few things to do 
 in Cradley for example there's a park 
 called the Rec. It's got football     
 pitches and tennis courts.It's also   
 got swing's, slides and climbing      
 frames.                               
   It was always a close knit community
 where everybody knew each other and   
 everybody worked hard because it was  
 an industrial area.
