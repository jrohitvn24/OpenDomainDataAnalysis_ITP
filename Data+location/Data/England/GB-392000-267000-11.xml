		<title>11WEST LODGE FARM, BROMSGROVE</title>
		<content> Although  most men retire  by 65 years
 of  age, Mr  Rhodes  and  his  brother
 continue to work  at  West  Lodge Farm
 even though  they  are  both  in their
 seventies.The 205 acres are almost all
{permanent pasture}for{hay} and grazing
 130  Friesian   beef {cattle} and  550
{sheep.}Their day starts  about  6.00am
 when they  check  their {livestock}and
 milk two cows  by  hand. This provides
 enough  milk  for the  calves and  for
 their  own   use. Their   working  day
 finishes about 5.00pm, unless they are
 busy   hay-making  or  sheep-dipping. 
 During  busy  times  they rely  on the
 help  of{contractors.}Mr Rhodes owns 3
 tractors, a combine, a  mowing machine
 and disc harrow.Very little artificial
{fertilizer}and  no {weed  killers} are
 used.Strangely, Mr Rhodes does not own
 a dog  but  11  pet cats are useful in
 controlling  rodent  numbers.         </content>
