		<content> The nearest Health Centre is six miles
 away but a doctor's surgery is held   
 twice weekly at the village hall at   
 midday on Mondays and Fridays.  People
 wishing to consult the doctor in the  
 evening must visit the Health Centre. 
 The nearest general hospital is also  
 six miles away in Grantham.           
 Dispensing is carried out by the local
 G.P. as the nearest chemist is in     
 Grantham.                             
 Childrens' Welfare Clinic is held once
 a month at the village hall.          
 Dental surgerys are in Grantham or    
 Newark.                               
 School children have their ears, eyes 
 and hair checked fairly regularly by  
 the school nurse.  A school doctor    
 usually visits the school annually.   
 The area is covered by a Community    
 Nurse.                                
                                       </content>
