		<content> A cob-walled cottage circa 1700 in    
 Kelly church Glebe was sold in 1948.  
 With extension and outbuildings it has
 been since 1972 home for Scottish     
 Baronet's widow, who left dower house 
 in Ayrshire for health reasons.Aged 75
 slight, vivacious with a positive     
 approach to problems of isolation and 
 ill health, she keeps hens, geese,    
 silkies, 2 returned guide dogs and fow
 terrier. Lets upstairs flat and has   
 twice weekly services of home help. A 
 car driver she shops in Tavistock or  
 Launceston and consults Lifton doctor.
 Concerned at breakdown of law and     
 order she considers magistrates too   
 lenient favours corpral and capital   
 punishment. Country loving she thinks 
 coursing a menace, but condemns  anti 
 bloodsport campaigners' dangerous     
 activities and do gooders, who release
 mink into the wild.                   </content>
