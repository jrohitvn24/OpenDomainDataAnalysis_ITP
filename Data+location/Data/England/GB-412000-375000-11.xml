		<content>  I get up about 08.00. My mum pats me 
 and says, "Wake up Emma!" or she      
 says, " It's time to get up Emma."    
 sometimes my mum lifts me out of bed  
 or I climb out of bed by my ladder.I  
 either get dressed first or I eat  my 
 breakfast, depending on what kind of  
 day it is.After washing it is time to 
 go to school which starts at 09.00.We 
 have an assembly every day except on  
 a Monday.We read until about 09.50.   
 Then  we have a  lesson that ends at  
 10.30 for playtime.Lessons begin again
 and last until 12.00 .We go in to the 
 hall for dinner. We go outside to have
 a playtime which ends at 13.20. The   
 next lesson ends at 14.35 for a ten   
 minute break.The last lesson ends at  
 15.50.                                
  Then it is time to go home.After and 
 before my tea I play rounders with my 
 friends.                              </content>
