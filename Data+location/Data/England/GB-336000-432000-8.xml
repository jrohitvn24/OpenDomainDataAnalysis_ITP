		<title>08Clifton Bank Farm, Plumpton</title>
		<content>     The farm is situated in the       
 village of Great Plumpton. It was     
 formerly part of the Clifton family's 
 South Fylde estate and was bought by  
 the present owner's father in 1936.   
                                       
     It is one of eight farms in the   
 area.{Until the mid-l950s it was a    
{dairy farm,}with about 20 acres of    
 arable land.                          
                                       
     Today,{barley}is grown in 175     
 acres. This is turned into fodder in  
 the farm's own miller-mix plant.      
                                       
     About 1000{pigs}are bred for their
 pork: live weight is 150-160 lbs and  
 dead weight about 110 lbs.            
                                       
     The farm is managed by two        
 brothers, with the help of one        
 full-time and one part-time labourer. </content>
