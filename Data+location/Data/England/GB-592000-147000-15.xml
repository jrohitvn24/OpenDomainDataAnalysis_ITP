     There are three different types   
of farms in our 12 square kilometres.  
 1. Arable; only crops.                
 2. Pasture; all grassland.            
 3. Mixed; both arable and pasture.    
                                       
 Within our 12 square kilometres there 
are 14 farms,but for this project we   
only visited 12 farms because two of   
the farms had only a farmhouse and     
very little land.                      
 The twelve farms that we visited grow 
grass, barley, maize, wheat, oil-seed  
rape, potatoes, oats and kale.         
 Animals that are kept are cows,       
sheep, and horses. One farm breeds     
trout, another bred greyhounds and one 
other had bullocks.                    
                                       
                                       </content>
