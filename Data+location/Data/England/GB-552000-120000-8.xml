		<content> The{Blackboys Inn}is a very old public
 house.It was built during the late    
 14th century.It is built of white     
 washed brick and weatherboard that has
 been painted black. It has old cow    
 dung and wattle walls and a very low  
 ceiling with thick beams. The first   
 customers were charcoal burners from  
 the woods where charcoal was being    
 burnt for iron smelting.They were     
 covered in black,dusty charcoal and   
 this is how the pub got its name.     
    The Inn has a ghost called Ann     
 Starr who died when she was 39 in     
 1804.Her father was the innkeeper.    
     Now the Inn is a popular place for
 locals and holidaymakers.It is in a   
 pretty country setting. It has a green
 at the front  with large chestnut     
 trees and at one side there is a duck 
 pond. The  Blackboys Cricket Club use 
 the Inn for their headquarters.       </content>
