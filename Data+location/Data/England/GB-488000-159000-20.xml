		<content> Our "patch" is mainly residential,    
 Conservative,very private - part of   
 the "back woods" of Surrey.House      
 prices range from Â£45,000 for a 2 bed-
 room,terrace house to over Â£120,000   
 for a four bedroom,executive house.   
 There is some withdrawal of children  
 from the state education system.Other-
 wise the area is completely comprehen-
 sive and its schools obtain good      
 results.At Collingwood in 1984 34.3%  
 of the whole 5th year gained 5 or more
 'O' level or equivalent passes.Occup- 
 ations are mainly managerial,profess- 
 ional and electrical engineering,with 
 a strong attachment to Heathrow.The   
 economic recession has had less impact
 here as new electrical and computer   
 industries are thriving.There is popu-
 lation movement into the area and     
 government plans for a further 20,000 
 houses in Surrey Heath by 2,000 AD.   </content>
