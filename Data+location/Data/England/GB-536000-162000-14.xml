		<title>14THE FORESTDALE FORUM</title>
		<content> The Forestdale Forum is like a        
 Community Centre for the Forestdale   
 Estate. Many activities take place    
 there like ballet, keep fit, nursery  
 school,autumn club,craft fairs, jumble
 sales.Most of us go to the Youth Club 
 which is held on Friday Evenings.There
 is also a bar which the Resident Club 
 use. This is open in the evenings and 
 at lunch times.The public are able to 
 hire the hall for special occasions   
 such as weddings. The Forum is        
 situated at the bottom of Bardolph    
 Avenue. Steve Little who runs the     
 Youth Club holds children's partys and
 does Forestdale Sound Discos.The Forum
 has a Car Park of it's own that the   
 public can use. The nursery school is 
 held every day from 9 until 12 noon.  
 The name Forum is used just as it used
 to be in Roman times. That is a place 
 for local people to meet.By Tracey C. </content>
