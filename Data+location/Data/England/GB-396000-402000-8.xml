		<title>08TOWN TWINNING</title>
		<content> The twin town of Mossley is Hem, a    
 small town in France near the Belgian 
 border. Twinning is a common feature  
 of many towns and cities in Great     
 Britain and the Continent. Mossley    
 Twinning Committee was formed in 1972 
 to develop cultural links with a      
 French town. Even before the 2nd World
 War, Mossley had an established       
 'French Firm' in the town, Mossley    
 Wool Combing, it was therefore quite  
 natural to extend these links to Hem. 
  Micklehurst Lads Morris,  a team of  
 young Morris Dancers, visited         
 Droylsden's Twin Town, Villemomble    
 near Paris in 1985. The team stayed   
 with French families and for many it  
 was their first visit abroad and      
 certainly their first experience of   
 living with a family speaking a       
 completely different language.
