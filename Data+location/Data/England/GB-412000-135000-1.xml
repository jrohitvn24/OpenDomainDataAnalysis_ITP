   This is an area stretching from the 
 'Christchurch' Avon in the West to    
 High Post Golf Course in the East,    
 north of Salisbury and south of       
 Amesbury. The soil is chalk and flint 
 and it is an area of arable and sheep 
 farming much visited by tourists as   
 they travel betwen Salisbury, with its
 cathedral and the ancient 'rotten     
 borough' of Old Sarum, to Stonehenge  
 and Avebury. There is also a strong   
 military connection with the Army at  
 Bulford, Tidworth and Wilton, and the 
 R.A.F. at Boscombe Down Experimental  
 Air Station, often using the the area 
 for training and relaxation.          
   The river is extensively fished for 
 trout.
