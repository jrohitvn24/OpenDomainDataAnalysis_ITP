		<title>15THE CHURCH OF ST JAMES</title>
		<content>  The church is called St.James. It was
 built in 1385. The church is made of  
 stone and bricks. Mr. Moore is the    
 vicar untill the real one comes. It   
 has a grave yard around the church.   
 Once one of the steeples fell down    
 becuse it was struck by lightning.    
   Their are six bells up the tower.   
 The people take turns in ringing the  
 bells. The church has just been       
 painted inside a creamy colour.       
 Inside the church the seats are all   
 made of wood. There is a path running 
 from the church through the grave yard
 to the chapel. There are two church   
 wardens Mrs. Mather and Mr. Clinch.   
 The church is one of the oldest       
 buildings in the village. There is a  
 parish room right next to the church  
 where they play skittles. The parish  
 room is in need of repair work.
