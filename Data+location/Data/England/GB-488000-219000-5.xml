		<content> Further on the right is an older house
 called the{Old Avairy,}where Hannah de
 Rothschild once kept an aviary. A     
 modern house has been built in the    
 former sunken garden there. The{Manor 
{House}follows, standing behind high   
 brick walls, end on to the road. This 
 has a Queen Anne facade, Elizabethan  
 kitchen quarters and 17th century wood
 panelling and is a listed building.   
 The high wall encloses a flourishing{ 
{blacksmith's shop}run by two brothers 
 and specialising in wrought-iron work,
 with a newly-built extension for the  
 forge. Finally there are 3 dwellings  
 converted from the Bothy once the     
 communal home for unmarried estate    
 gardeners.                            
 Apart from the Stable Yard, there are 
 no shops of any description in        
 Mentmore.
