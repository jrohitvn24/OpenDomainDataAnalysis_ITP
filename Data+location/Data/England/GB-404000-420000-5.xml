		<content> Based in Halifax, the local{newspaper,
 the{'Evening Courier'}is distributed  
 throughout{Calderdale.}A typical      
 edition of the 'Voice of Calderdale', 
 tells of the main local events as well
 as outlining the national topics. One 
 specific edition, that printed on July
 31, 1985, headlines a story           
 concerning a four-man delegation to be
 sent to Brazil for an international   
 conference on local authorities. The  
 paper also wrote cover stories on a   
 Sowerby Bridge man who conned         
 showbusiness stars into giving him    
 money supposedly in aid of striking   
 miners, and a young Ovenden man who   
 used his weightlifting equipment to   
 plunge a bayonet-like dagger into his 
 body.
