		<title>17OTHER SMALL LOCAL INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>     On the outskirts of the northern  
 parts of Oakham are a number of small 
 businesses. The Springfields Hotel, a 
 Pets Hotel and Riding Stables have    
 been constructed out of the remains of
 a derelict house and out_buildings.   
     Nearby is Hillside Farm: the house
 occupied by a furniture repairer and  
 restorer; though the out_buildings and
 land are still ussed as a farm. The   
 woodworker retired from the navy,     
 started wood_working as a hobby which 
 grew into a flourishing 'cottage      
 industry'.                            
     In Ashwell there is a garden      
 centre where the usual range of plants
 and goods are on offer.               
     There is also a garage run by     
 Victor Woods: this provides petrol as 
 well as new and second_hand cars      
                                       
                                       </content>
