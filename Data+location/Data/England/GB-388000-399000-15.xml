		<title>15A DAY IN THE LIFE OF KAY</title>
		<content>    I am 10 years old.  My mum works at
 D.J. Security Alarms and my dad is a  
 draughtsman.  I have a brother called 
 Andrew and he is 8.  He keeps tropical
 fish.  We also have a budgie called   
 Buzby.                                
    On the first Saturday in May we    
 went into Manchester on an orange and 
 white bus.  We paid 35p for my mum and
 10p for me on the bus.  We walked up  
 to Debenhams and up the escalator to  
 the top floor where my mum paid her   
 chargecard bill.  Then we went to the 
 big cafeteria and had a drink and some
 chips and sandwiches.  I got a new    
 dress for my holidays then we bought  
 some food and caught the bus home.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
