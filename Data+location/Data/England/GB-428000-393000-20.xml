		<title>20TRADITIONAL GAMES</title>
		<content> The old traditional game of"{Nor"}and 
{"Spell"}or"{Knur"}and"{Spell"}was     
 played in this area. There were       
 fiercely fought competitions between  
 players from Worrall and Oughtibridge,
 many of the older residents today     
 remember  the game.It was played on   
 Devil's Hill,a field near Low Ash     
 Farm.The players used a long stick of 
 cane or hazel,to the end of which was 
 fixed a solid piece of wood.This stick
 was used to hit the edge of the       
 "spell"which was the receptacle on a  
 spring,holding the small wooden or    
 pottery ball,the "nor".The player     
 struck the ball as it rose into the   
 air,and the various stakes placed on  
 the ground determined the score by    
 showing how far the ball had been     
 struck.The game required great skill. 
 During building, old balls have been  
 found.                                </content>
