		<content>The land is flat and low lying.At      
Salisbury Lodge there is a field for   
geese and an oak lined road.There is   
a deciduous copse and a hay field.     
Opposite a potato field there is a     
field of sheep and one of wheat.Here   
the soil is a thin clay.On the same    
soil there are small fields of cabbaqe 
lined by deciduous trees followed by   
fenced grazing land.An oil pipeline    
from the refinery at Fawley is being   
laid to take oil to the Midlands.The   
soil changes here to silver sand and   
the land though still low lying is more
undulating.On all sides there are      
Silver Birch trees and Scots Pine with 
heather and bracken.Forest ponies are  
here.
