 Arkwright Community Centre began in   
 1984 in the school building.It is very
 popular and it is doing much better   
 than we expected.People have responded
 enthusiastically to the whole idea.   
 Many activities go off such as 2 youth
 clubs,junior and senior,50+ club      
 table tennis,dancing,keep fit,mothers 
 and toddlers,slimming and many others.
 We organised a gala in July.Everybody 
 took part.We had stalls and games and 
 made a lot of money to help our       
 centre.Everybody had a great time.Many
 people who go to the centre think it  
 is a very good idea because they can  
 take part in all the activities and   
 meet friends and have a good time and 
 before it started there was nothing to
 do.
