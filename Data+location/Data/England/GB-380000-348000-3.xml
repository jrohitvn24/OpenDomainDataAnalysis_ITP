		<title>03Chesterton - the People</title>
		<content>                                       
The  people  of  Chesterton come from a
greater  variety  of  backgrounds  than
might  be expected.   The  majority are
working class,  but  movements  in  the
mining industry  brought two  waves  of
"immigrants"  to  the   village  mostly
since the second world war.   One group
are from what folk here  call  "t'other
Newcastle",that is Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
Their presence can mostly  be  detected
in the hint of Geordie  accent  in  the
local accent.   The second  group  were
Polish.   There are  still  second  and
third generation Polish surnames on the
roll of the  High School.    The  local
dialect is difficult for an outsider to
follow.     However,  local  people are
friendly. Chesterton is a happy village
and if someone  passes  on  the  street
they will probably say "Hello".
