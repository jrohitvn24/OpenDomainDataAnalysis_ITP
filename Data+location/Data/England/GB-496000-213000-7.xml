		<content>   The earliest part of the            
 Bridgewater Arms,dates back to the    
 18th century.                         
 Towards the end of the century the    
 Garret family,later to become the     
 managers of the inn,were farmers on a 
 site near there.                      
   The pub's first use was as a        
 caoching inn and a school.It was like 
 a village hall.In 1838 the Garrets    
 were managers of the inn.When the     
 house was made into an inn it was     
 during or before the lifetime of the  
 7th Earl of Bridgewater.              
   Now the pub sells food and has      
 private flats at the top.The sign     
 shows a ducal coronet.                
   The Bridgewater Monument,built in   
 memory of the 7th Earl of             
 Bridgewater's wife,stands in Ashridge 
 woods.It was built in 1832 and has 172
 steps.                                </content>
