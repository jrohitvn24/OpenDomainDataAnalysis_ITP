		<content>MAY:In May you let the cattle out to   
graze for the summer because it is too 
hot in the sheds.Also you have to      
drench the cattle which means you give 
them a kind of medicine which stops    
them from getting bugs and worms which 
grow inside them.You have to clean out 
the sheds where the cattle have        
been staying over the winter.You have  
to make silage for feeding the cattle  
in the winter.You cut the grass and put
it in a heap and leave it to rot then  
feed it to the cattle in the winter.   
JUNE:Shear and dip the sheep in        
disinfectant to stop them having bots  
and maggots. The wool goes to market.  
JULY:Make the hay by cutting the long  
grass and leaving it to dry.Then bale  
it and stack it in sheds. Also drench  
the sheep and cattle for worms.
