		<title>15The Crown Inn, Everleigh</title>
		<content> Formerly the Dower House, the Crown   
 Inn was converted to its present use  
 in 1790. During its life span it has  
 played host to all manner of sporting 
 persuits including Falconry, Hare     
 Coarsing, the Tedworth Fox Hounds, and
 angling on the R.Avon which runs      
 through the grounds.                  
 Standing at the original crossroads   
 between Salisbury and Marlborough, the
 Crown served an important role a      
 coach house.                          
 The Crown was used as a Court House by
 Circuit Judges, one of whom was       
 "Hanging" Judge Jefferies. The first  
 case in which finger print evidence   
 was used was tried here.              
 In present times the Crown is the     
 meeting place for village activities, 
 i.e. Polling Station and Parish       
 Council meetings,etc.
