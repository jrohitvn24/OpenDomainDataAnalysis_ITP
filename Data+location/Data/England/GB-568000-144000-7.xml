		<title>07CHANGING NATURE OF HOUSES</title>
		<content>Eight cottages were built 180 years ago
for workers at Brandenbury Farm. They  
were "tied" cottages so if you lost    
your job on the farm you lost the house
also. Now they are all privately owned.
All now have bathrooms, electricity and
some have extensions e.g.No.2 now has 6
rooms instead of the original 4. One   
family have put old fashioned beams    
into their cottage and have also kept  
the wooden doors with the old iron     
locks. It seems from what we have heard
that people in our area prefer older   
houses because they have more          
character. One interviewee said that   
she didn't mind extensions but she     
likes them to be in keeping with the   
house. Unfortunately some are not.     
Another change is that people are      
converting and modernising oast houses.
A description of one of these is in the
next section.                          </content>
