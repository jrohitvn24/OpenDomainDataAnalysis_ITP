		<title>11Smarden W. - Village Church</title>
		<content> The church of St. Michael the         
 Archangel was built in the 14th/15th  
 centuries. A list of rectors dates    
 back to 1205. This church is          
 remarkable for its proportions and    
 grandeur of size. The aisleless       
 nave, 36' across, dictates the use of 
 a scissors beam roof and this has led 
 to the church being named 'the barn of
 Kent'. Today the parishes of Smarden  
 and Biddenden are under the care of   
 the Rev. Roger Smith who was licensed 
 in Sept. 1985. The times of service   
 have to be adapted to the needs of    
 both parishes. Smarden has a          
 fair-sized choir, a keen band of      
 bellringers, an active parochial      
 church council and St. Michael's Guild
 (Ladies who raise funds for church    
 restoration). The church is visited by
 tourists from many countries,         
 attracted by its history and setting. </content>
