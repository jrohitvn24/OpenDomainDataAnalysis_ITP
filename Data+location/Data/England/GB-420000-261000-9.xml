		<content>{The Life of a Farmer's Wife.          
 As well as being a housewife and      
 mother I have to be able to turn my   
 hand to many farm jobs.e.g. handling  
 cattle,driving tractors for many      
 different jobs,moving corn,stacking   
 hay and straw bales, helping with     
 general building and maintenance      
 jobs.bookkeeping and geneal office    
 work. I have to be prepared to do     
 these jobs at a minutes notice fitting
 housework around them.                
{The Life of a Farmer's Son.           
 From 28th May to 20th June I help with
 the silage.Mum drives the tractor up &amp;
 down the fields,Dad drives the tractor
 with the forage harvester on the back.
 That picks up the grass,chops it,blows
 it into the trailer until full.Dad un-
 hooks it,Mum changes full for empty &amp; 
 takes silage to the silo,where it is  
 rolled down for winter cattle food.   </content>
