		<title>11THE ALLOTMENTS</title>
		<content> On the Western side of our school     
 field is land used for allottments    
 which was also what the land was used 
 for before the school was built in    
 1972. There are about 20 allottments  
 left on the plot now. The crops that  
 were growing were peas, potatoes,     
 beetroot, rapberiies, gooseberries,   
 onions, lettuces, cabbages, beans,    
 currants, rhubarb and mint. The tools 
 being used were forks, hoes, shovels  
 and spades. We saw a dogrose, some    
 sweetwilliams,honeysuckle, irises,    
 roses, carnations and pansies being   
 grown. We met a man who was going to  
 plant some cabbages. Our teacher asked
 the man how long he had had his plot  
 and he said 7 years. He said he had no
 flowers growing, only vegetables, and 
 he spent a lot of time digging,       
 planting and weeding.
