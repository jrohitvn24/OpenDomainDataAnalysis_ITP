		<title>07WARKWORTH PAGEANT 1983</title>
		<content> In{1982}an idea was formulated by the 
 villagers to hold a{pageant}in the    
 bailey of{Warkworth Castle}based upon 
 the{history}of the castle. It was     
 thought that this was an original idea
 until someone said that they had taken
 part in the{1928 Pageant.}It was then 
 discovered that there had been about  
{five pageants}in the{1920s and 30s.   
 People were needed to fill the{two-   
{hundred}parts so the vicar, teachers, 
 pupils, farmers, and shopkeepers      
 volunteered.{Costumes}were needed and 
 everybody made their own.{Shields}were
 made by prisoners from{Acklington     
{Prison. Fight scenes}were carefully   
 rehearsed.{Fund-raising}activities    
 began and the whole village was       
 involved. The{press and radio}became  
 interested - then television. The     
 Pageant was{a huge success}and was    
 shown on{national BBC TV in 1984.     </content>
