		<title>12FOOTPATHS - HATHERDEN</title>
		<content> In the days before modern transport   
 people who wished to go anywhere      
 outside their village had to use what 
 were called "Rights Of Way".These were
 of three types-footpaths for walkers; 
 bridleways for horseriders and walkers
 and Road Users Public Paths(R.U.P.P.).
 There were in addition "Green Roads"  
 which were merely grass covered       
 roads.Because people wished to make   
 their journey as short as possible    
 most Rights Of Way are the shortest   
 distance between two points.In our    
 area we have 8 footpaths and one      
 R.U.P.P.These cover about five miles  
 and most are quite well used.The      
 R.U.P.P. from Dowlands Pitts(just out 
 of our block to the north)to the      
 Hatherden- Wildhern road is called the
 Roman Road and known locally as       
 Hungerford Lane and is a very old     
 road.                                 </content>
