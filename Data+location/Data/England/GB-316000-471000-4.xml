		<content>  Vickers used to build all sorts of   
 ships, like liners, oil-tankers and   
 warships. They built the first British
 submarine. Now they build{nuclear-    
{powered submarines}for the Royal Navy.
 Vickers will build the new Trident    
 submarines.                           
                                       
  The other old industry, iron &amp; steel 
 making, closed down in 1983. The old  
{Steelworks are being pulled down now. 
 Some people want to{save some of the  
{buildings.}They are not very nice, but
 they want to keep some of Barrow's    
 history.                              
                                       
  British Steel had been running the   
 works down for some years, and people 
 started looking for{other jobs}to do  
 instead. That is why there are{new    
{factories}all along Park Road, through
 Ormsgill and Sowerby Wood.            </content>
