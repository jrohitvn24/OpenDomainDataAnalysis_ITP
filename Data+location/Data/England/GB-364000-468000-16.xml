		<title>16BENTHAM PANTOMIME</title>
		<content> In 1981 the first pantomime           
 (Cinderella) was produced by John     
 Hicks. It starred Alison Hawkey, Keith
 Cowling and Kevin McSherry. So great  
 was it's success that others followed.
 Puss in Boots (1982), Aladdin (1983), 
 Snow White (1984) and Peter Pan       
 (1985). The latter two shows were     
 written by the cast. The pantos came  
 from the driving force of Heather Guy 
 and Jillian Taylor who revived a past 
 tradition of live performances. The   
 group has excellent scenery created by
 Edna Watt and Brian Cowling also      
 lively and relevant music devised by  
 Zosia Koc. It is thought that the     
 future may see this evolve into       
 other spheres such as several small   
 productions or one more complex       
 effort.
