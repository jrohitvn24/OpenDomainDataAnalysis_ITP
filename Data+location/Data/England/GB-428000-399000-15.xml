		<title>15Wortley-Maypole Dancing</title>
		<content> Every summer at Wortley School we have
 Maypole Dancing. It has been a        
 tradition for over 80 years. We use   
 the original maypole and tie 16 red,  
 blue, green and yellow ribbons on it. 
 Sometimes we make paper flowers to    
 decorate the top. We normally start   
 practising in June. It is hard work   
 dancing round the maypole on hot days 
 and on grass but we all enjoy it very 
 much. Everyone in the school takes    
 part - even the boys. The dances for  
 the infants are easy but it is        
 difficult for them to skip in time to 
 the music. The dances for the older   
 children are very complicated. In some
 dances such as The Basket the ribbons 
 make a closed plait round the pole. In
 Spider's Web the ribbons weave an     
 open pattern. Our Maypole Day is      
 always a bright and happy occasion.
