 We asked people in our area how they  
 heated their home. Over three-quarters
 of people  replied that they used Gas,
 either as Gas Central Heating or Gas  
 fires.                                
    The rest were evenly divided       
 between coal and electric. It was     
 interesting to see that nobody used   
 oil.We decided that this was probably 
 because of the great increase in its  
 price over the last ten years.        
   We thought the reasons so many      
 people used Gas are because it was the
 cheapest, -the price has increased    
 recently since most people had it     
 installed - and it is very clean.
