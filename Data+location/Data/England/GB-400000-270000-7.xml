		<content>   There are 3 different kinds of      
 transport in Alvechurch, road, rail   
 and the canal. By road there are 4    
 main bus services in Alvechurch       
 provided by the Midland Red. The rail 
 service runs from Redditch to         
 Birmingham. The first train leaves    
 Redditch at 7.11am, and the last train
 back from Birmingham is at 6.50pm. The
 trains do not run on Sunday. There is 
 one garage with petrol and one for    
 main services and paint respraying.   
 There are many different kinds of boat
 on the canal, and many come from the  
 Marina. The canal barges used to carry
 bricks from the brick works which has 
 been closed for many years. The       
 Alvechurch Marina is attached to the  
 Birmingham and Worcester canal. By    
 using the canal you can reach the     
 River Severn at Worcester. The Marina 
 is now a boating centre.              </content>
