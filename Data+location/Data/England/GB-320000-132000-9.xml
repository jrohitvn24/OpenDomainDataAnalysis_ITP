		<title>09ENMORE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Enmore National School was one of the 
 first free elementary schools in the  
 country.It was founded in 1810 by the 
 Rev. John Poole, Rector of Enmore. He 
 used the 'Monitorial System' under    
 which the older children (monitors)   
 taught the rest under the supervision 
 of a teacher. He also introduced the  
 teaching of English grammar and       
 Arithmetic which was unusual at that  
 time. By 1812 the monitorial system   
 was widely known in the area.         
 John Poole applied successfully for a 
 grant to build a bigger school in     
 Enmore. By 1837 plans were drawn up   
 for the present building to be erected
 on land donated by the Earl of Egmont.
 The total cost was estimated at two   
 hundred and seventy-seven pounds. With
 few alterations to the south-facing   
 front the buildings remain  the same  
 today as they were in Poole's time.   </content>
