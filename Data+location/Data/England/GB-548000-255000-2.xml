		<title>02THE OLD PEOPLES HOME</title>
		<content> There are 5 separate flats, housing   
 41 old people.                        
 We talked to some of the residents.   
 One was very excited because it was   
 bath night on Tuesdays! Another, who  
 was 92 years old, remembered seeing a 
 motor car for the first time. It was  
 open-topped and kept stuttering and   
 stopping going up a hill. A former    
 teacher told us she used to cycle 9   
 miles each way to school, until she   
 was knocked off her bicycle. A        
 much-appreciated resident was the one 
 who cheered the others up with jokes  
 and stories.                          
 All the residents have jobs in the    
 Home, like laying the table or washing
 up. They like it there because the    
 food is good and would not like to    
 live in Cambridge on account of the   
 noise and bustle of too many people.
