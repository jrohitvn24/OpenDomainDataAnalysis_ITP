  The block is a mixture of{housing}and
{industrial complexes.}The housing is  
 generally modern, post 1950. The      
 industrial complexes are generally    
 fuel and chemical complexes, because  
 of the closeness of the{River Thames. 
{Texaco}have a large fuel depot here,  
 as do{British Gas. London and Coastal 
{Wharves}also have a depot here, and   
 they store a variety of chemicals, all
 brought in by sea. There is a safe    
 haven here for large heavy ships, and 
 each company has its own private      
 jetty, so that ships can safely       
 discharge their cargoes. There is also
 some{farming,}mainly corn growing,    
 although some hay is also grown. There
 is also the oldest{pub}on Canvey to be
 found close to the sea wall.
