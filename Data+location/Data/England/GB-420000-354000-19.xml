		<title>19LIFE STYLES - Child's Day</title>
		<content> On Saturday morning I was in bed and  
 Mark(brother) &amp; Mum were down stairs. 
 Mum told Mark to come &amp; fetch me so he
 did. I said I would get cold so Mark  
 pulled me off the bed &amp; down stairs,  
 Mum brought my clothes down so I put  
 them on. Then Dad came down stairs.   
 Mum was making Dad's porridge for     
 breakfast, I had my breakfast.  After 
 breakfast Dad went to the bathroom to 
 clean his teeth, also his hands and   
 face, then he put his boots .While Dad
 was doing this I went to have a wash. 
 I went with Dad  to Longcliffe, I saw 
 Julie(my friend)there, &amp; asked Dad if 
 I could go to play with her, he said  
 yes.   We went silaging, Julie and I  
 were holding silage bags down and we  
 got messy.  Julie showed me a dead cat
 Julie's Mum was burying it.   We all  
 went down to the house and Julie gave 
 me some sweets, we then went back up .</content>
