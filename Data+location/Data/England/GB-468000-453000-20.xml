		<title>20Concerns in Stamford Bridge</title>
		<content> A high security prison being built at 
 the nearby village of Full Sutton is  
 giving concern to some of the         
 villagers.Some are worried about the  
 risk of escaped inmates. Others are   
 more concerned about the visitors to  
 the prison who will travel through    
 Stamford Bridge,as there are no       
 facilities for them,especially if they
 have young children. River Derwent:   
 Pressure is being applied to allow    
 more boats on the river.Some villagers
 believe that more people should       
 benifit from the beautiful scenery    
 along its banks.Others believe that   
 noise and litter will spoil the peace 
 and beauty of the river.They are also 
 worried that the wildlife on the river
 will be threatened.The R.Derwent is   
 one of the few rivers with otters     
 living on its banks.It is also one of 
 the cleanest rivers in England.       </content>
