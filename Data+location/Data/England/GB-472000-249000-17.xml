 ROADE IS QUITE A BIT BIGGER THAN THE  
OTHER VILLAGES IN THE AREA.THERE ARE   
ABOUT 900 HOUSES.                      
  THERE ARE TWO HOUSING ESTATES WHICH  
WERE BUILT IN THE 1960-1970 PERIOD.    
  THERE ARE SOME OLD STONE HOUSES IN   
HARTWELL ROAD,BRETTS LANE AND THE HIGH 
STREET.                                
  ROADE IS DIFFERENT TO MOST VILLAGES  
BECAUSE IT HAS A BIG FACTORY.          
  ABOUT HALF OF OUR PARENTS WORK THERE.
SOME PEOPLE COME HERE FROM OTHER       
VILLAGES OR NORTHAMPTON.               
 IT HAS QUITE A FEW SHOPS BUT THEY ARE 
NOT TOGETHER,THEY ARE SPREAD ALL OVER  
THE VILLAGE.
