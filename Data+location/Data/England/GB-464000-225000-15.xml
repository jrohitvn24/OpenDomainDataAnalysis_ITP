		<title>15Population of Twyford Area</title>
		<content> The population is 100% English        
 -speaking,1 or 2 % are not English by 
 birth and English is not their native 
 tongue.The farmers are mostly local - 
 born people.As with most villages the 
 population is growing due to the      
 building of new houses and renovation 
 of older properties.The newcomers come
 from all parts of Britain.Different   
 social groups are not very noticable. 
 About 5 properties are occupied by    
 people well above working-class       
 status.There are more than average    
 one-person households.Mainly old local
 people who are often helped in the    
 upkeep of their own home by good      
 neighbours and the village community. 
 When local people die they are usually
 buried in the village graveyard or    
 cremated and have a small memorial in 
 the Churchyard.
