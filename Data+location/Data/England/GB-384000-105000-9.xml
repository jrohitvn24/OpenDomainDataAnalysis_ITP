		<content>   The large amount of woodland means a
 rich &amp; varied wildlife.Deer,foxes (a  
 pair raised 5 cubs this year in the   
 Hangings) &amp; badgers can be seen. There
 are the usual small mammals to note; &amp;
 nestboxes in the woods have been used 
 by the less common{Dormouse.          
   Birdlife is also a feature.The river
 provides nest sites for Kingfishers,  
 now on the increase. In the reed beds 
 have been sighted an{Attis Warbler,   
 Reed &amp; Sedge Warblers, Reed Buntings  
 and Pied Wagtails. On the estate 3    
 pairs of Sparrow-hawk and Kestrel, 5  
 pairs of Tawny Owl and occasionally a 
 Buzzard have been observed.           
   The rarest wildlife in the area is  
 the colony of{Greater Horseshoe Bats  
 living in the Old Kitchen block by St 
 Martin's. This was re-roofed recently,
 with a grant from central government, 
 in order to help preserve the colony. </content>
