		<content>  Basing House                         
 On a hill in Basing are the ruins of  
 Basing House.The first castle was     
 built in Norman times. During the     
 reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the house 
 was rebuilt in red brick.It was the   
 largest private house in England. It  
 was owned by the Marquess of          
 Winchester.During the Civil War,      
 1642-1645, Basing House was held for  
 King Charles I.In the last year of the
 war, the house was bombarded by the   
 Roundheads and overrun.The house was  
 looted and then burnt down.           
      At the ruins of Basing House     
 there are a few dungeons, some very   
 deep wells, cellars and extensive     
 earthworks. It has a tunnel which is  
 100 metres long.We saw kitchens and an
 octagonal dovecote,where doves still  
 reside.                               
                                       </content>
