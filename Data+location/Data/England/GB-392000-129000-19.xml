		<content> Tisbury got its name from a Saxon     
 chief.                                
   One of Tisbury famous sons was the  
 author Rudyard Kipling. His parents   
 lived in the village in the Gables    
 House. They are buried in the local   
 church yard.                          
   Kipling himself lived in Tisbury for
 a few months and was a keen member of 
 the Tisbury Amateur Cricket Club.     
   Tisbury coral is unique to any other
 coral in the world. It was not        
 discovered until quite recently when  
 mains sewerage was introduced to      
 Hindon Lane.
