		<content> In the early part of 1985 the area    
 was, in common with other parts of the
 south west, invaded by any army of    
 workmen with heavy digging equipment. 
 A project was mounted by the Gas      
 Authority which consisted of the      
 laying of an underground line to carry
 a secondary supply of gas in huge     
 pipes right across the countryside and
 under roads. Farmers, landowners nd   
 tenants were compensated for the      
 disturbance of the land/or loss of    
 crops nd when the pipes were in place 
 the Authority re-instated the field   
 etc. that they had crossed.  However, 
 in spite of the fact that there is now
 a supply of gas beneath their feet the
 people of the area remain, as before, 
 without this amenity.
