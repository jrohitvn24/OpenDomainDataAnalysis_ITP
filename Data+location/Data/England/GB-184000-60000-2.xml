		<content> My square covers{COLAN CHURCH}which   
 has a tower and Colan Wood.It also has
 a lovely view of Porth Reservoir which
 often has boats sailing on it in nice 
 weather.Around it are lush green      
 fields which often contain cattle,    
 grass or barley. Around the fields    
 there are lots of trees which are     
 mainly Sycamore or Oak. {COLAN WOOD}is
 owned by the {HOBLYN ESTATE}which as  
 been allowed to run into disrepair    
 because they cannot trace the rightful
 heirs.  In the wood there was a       
 spacious farmhouse and surrounding    
 barns but this is now in ruins and    
 covered with ivy. Included in the     
 buildings is a {BELL TOWER}which has  
 ivy all around it. All the stonework  
 is ELVAN and near the Belltower there 
 is a disused watertank which is rusted
 away at the top.
