 The Pyewipe Inn is situated by the    
 Fossdyke canal and the railway. An    
 elevated section of the Lincoln       
 by_pass passes within one hundred     
 yards. Access to the inn by road is   
 along a narrow single track road      
 leading off the A57 road alternatively
 there is a footpath leading out from  
 the City of Lincoln along the bank of 
 the Fossdyke canal.                   
 They have a varied menu and also      
 have a room set aside for dancing and 
 wedding receptions. There is also an  
 adventure playground for children. It 
 is a very popular place especially    
 during the summer months when         
 customers can eat and drink outside   
 by the Fossdyke canal.
