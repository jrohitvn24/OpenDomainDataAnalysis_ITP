		<title>02FOCUS ON M62 MOTORWAY.(1)</title>
		<content> To find out the amount,and            
 categories,of traffic using the       
 motorway  passing through the area on 
 a week day, we did several counts with
 the following results.                
 On average,the number of vehicles     
 passing throughthe village of Whitley 
 Bridge via the M62, on a  week day    
 is approximately 11,500. 47% of which 
 are goods vehicles, an equal          
 proportion of private vehicles,and    
 only 6% being passenger vehicles such 
 as coaches and mini buses.            
 During the day, many vehicles enter   
 and leave the Motorway at the         
 junctions at Whitley Bridge.The       
 majority of the vehicles joining the  
 Motorway due West are from Selby, the 
 rest are from Doncaster, which is a   
 major mining town to the South of the 
 area.                                 
                                       </content>
