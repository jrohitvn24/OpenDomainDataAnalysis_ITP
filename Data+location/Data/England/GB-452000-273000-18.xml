		<title>18Railways in Rugby</title>
		<content>    Rugby is situated on the west coast
 mainline, the former L.N.W.R. There is
 also a freight only line to the Rugby 
 Portland Cement works.                
    At the railway embankment in our   
 area it is possible to see main line  
 and commuter traffic. The line is part
 of the electrified system, except the 
 freight only line on which there are  
 only two trains per day pulled by     
 diesel traction.                      
    It always advisable to note the    
 danger of overhead wires, any contact 
 with the wires (whether a train is    
 coming or not) will almost certainly  
 give you a fatal electric shock. In   
 order to keep people safe the railway 
 line is fenced off.{Do not abuse the  
{gates or fences, they were built to   
{keep people out of danger. }
