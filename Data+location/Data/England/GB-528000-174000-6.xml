		<title>06Our Diet.</title>
		<content>We measured and recorded everything we 
ate in one day. We asked family and    
friends to join in. Then we checked to 
see if our diet was balanced. Most     
children in our class had too many     
carboydrates. They had too many sweets 
and not enough VITAMINS or PROTEINS.   
Only about four children didn't have   
any sweets all day they had fruit      
instead. Children's diets could be     
improved by limiting the quantity of   
sweets eaten. They would'nt get tooth  
decay and have healthier bodies. I did 
not have a balanced diet. I had mostly 
carbohydrates but at least I had       
proteins. I think I had too many       
carbohydrates because most food was    
made of lots of sugar. I didn't have   
enough vitamins.If we had'nt made      
Ratatouille or the other things we had 
at school I would'nt have had any      
vitamins.                              </content>
