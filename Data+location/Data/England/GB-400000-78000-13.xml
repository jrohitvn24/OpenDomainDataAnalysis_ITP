		<content>   Leeson House is a special type of   
 school and Field Study Centre, where  
 each year, many people go to study    
 nature and wildlife. In the grounds   
 there are many small wild animals and 
 the biggest rookery in the Purbeck    
 area. There are also two man-made     
 ponds where pond life is studied.     
   Children stay there for a week or a 
 weekend. They can also visit Durlston 
 or Studland to study the wildlife.    
 They can go on coastal walks, spot sea
 birds, visit one of the many farms,   
 visit Corfe Castle, or study the many 
 rocks on the surrounding hills. In the
 evening they write up and discuss the 
 day's study.                          
    It is open most of the year and is 
 funded by the Dorset County Council,  
 but people are asked to pay a small   
 fee towards the cost of the food.
