		<title>02EDUCATION ST.MARTINS I.O.S.</title>
		<content>   In this Primary School on           
 St.Martins Isles of Scilly there are  
 only seven children and one teacher.  
 The pupils ages range from 6 years to 
 11 years.The good thing about having  
 such a small school is that we all get
 individual attention.The trouble with 
 having such a small school is that we 
 don't have a choice of friends.Because
 we live on an island we can go out and
 do work about the enviroment.You start
 school by coming on Friday afternoons 
 when you are three and nine months,   
 then you go two afternoons, then every
 afternoon, then you go every afternoon
 and two mornings, then you go all week
 until you are eleven, when you go to  
 Secondary School.There are two        
 classrooms, one is used for quiet work
 and the other for practical           
 activities.We do not lack materials   
 and equipment because we are small.   </content>
