		<title>01FARMING AROUND COOKHAM DEAN</title>
		<content>  The area of land between Maidenhead  
 and Marlow forms part of the terraces 
 of the River Thames, and has been     
 extensively farmed for centuries.     
 Today the farms in the area cover     
 almost the full range of agricultural 
 activities; from pig farming to       
 poultry, dairy farming to fruit.      
   The land is predominantly chalk,    
 with pockets of clay and gravel. In   
 recent years several areas of gravel  
 have been extracted by the Summerleaze
 Gravel Co. At present they are digging
 gravel from land adjacent to Cannon   
 Court Farm. In most cases the land has
 been restored to its former use, or   
 has been developed as reservoirs.     
   The river terraces are very steeply 
 sloping, and as a result are          
 unsuitable for agriculture. This land 
 has either been left as pasture, or   
 is covered with mixed woodland.       </content>
