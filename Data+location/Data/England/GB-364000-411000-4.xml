		<content> Most of the land is rough             
 grazing.There were 6 farms,none had   
 cattle grazing on the land.One farm   
 house was used by a farmer,the rest   
 being residential homes.              
 There were also 3 working quarries,all
 moderatlt small.There was also        
 disused gravel pit, used for fishing  
 now.                                  
 There were not many houses ,just a few
 1950's semi's and some old weaver's   
 houses.These houses were built of 3   
 floors.The second &amp; third floors were 
 used like a normal house,but the first
 floor was used as a special           
 workroom.The weavers making all their 
 cloth here.These houses were built    
 before the expansion of the Cotton    
 industry in this area.
