 I live in a big house with a big      
 garden and  lots of country side      
 around me.There are  5 fields 5       
 gardens and 1 barn.                   
 I love my house very much. I would not
 sell it for anything. In side the     
 house there are 7 bedrooms. I have a  
 bedroom of my own. Mum is going to put
 some shelves  in it and she has put a 
 desk in it already. It also has a bed 
 to sleep in like most people have. I  
 keep my toys in it. We have 3         
 bathrooms 2 upstairs 1 downstairs. We 
 have a back door and a front door.    
 3 kitchens 1 drawing room.We have a   
 playroom too.Our house is old it is   
 283 years old.
