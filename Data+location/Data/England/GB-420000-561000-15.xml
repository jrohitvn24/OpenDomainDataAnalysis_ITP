		<title>15SUNDAY IN BENWELL</title>
		<content> It is{Sunday}and I get up at half past
 seven. I wash my face and brush my    
 teeth. I have some{Rice Krispies}for  
 my breakfast. At about half past ten I
 go to St. Joseph's church for mass.   
 Today some of the children are making 
 their first{Holy Communion}and I am   
 singing in the choir.                 
 After mass I go home and draw some    
 pictures and read a book. I often have
 fish and chicken and rice for dinner  
 on a Sunday. After dinner I do my book
 summary for my reading book and I have
 to look after my baby sister. I have  
 rice, egg, and fish for supper and    
 then my mam and dad went out to work. 
 I get washed and watch the{television}
 for a while. Now it is bed time, it is
 half past eight and I am going to bed.
 Sunday is over for another week.
