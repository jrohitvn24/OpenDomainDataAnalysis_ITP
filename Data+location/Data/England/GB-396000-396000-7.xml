		<content> Our school and the estate around it   
 are on Hough hill. The road and the   
 wood are near Cheethams Park, and are 
 called Early Bank. They were all owned
 by the Cheetham family. The Cheethams 
 were very rich. The stone wall which  
 separates the road and the wood was   
 built by the Cheethams. The last of   
 the family was Agnes Cheetham. She    
 died at the age of ninety nine, and   
 left the park to Tameside. She died in
 1932. Many of the trees at the top of 
 the park, are oak. Rabbits, jays and  
 grey squirrels are some of the        
 wildlife in the park. There are       
 rhododendrons, and the horse chestnut,
 which has been growing in England for 
 only 300 years. There is a quarry in  
 the park. People are not allowed to go
 there. The old coach house is now used
 by the gardeners. There is a Victorian
 walled garden still used as a garden. </content>
