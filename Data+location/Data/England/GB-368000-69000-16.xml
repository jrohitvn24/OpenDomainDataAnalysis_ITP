		<content> Portland limestone has been quarried  
 and used since Roman and Saxon times. 
 The particular carving capabilities of
 Portland Stone have provided a rich   
 heritage of art and architecture.  The
 greatest exponent of Portland Stone is
 to be found in the work of Sir        
 Christopher Wren.  The stoneworks at  
 Easton is owned by Bath and Portland  
 Stone Limited, the largest masonry    
 company in the United Kingdom.  The   
 stoneworks employs 61 full time staff 
 at the time of writing. The factory at
 Easton is the most advanced limestone 
 works in Britain providing cut stone  
 for projects as far afield as Northern
 Ireland, West Wales, Manchester,      
 Cambridge, London and the Channel     
 Islands.  Relatively little carving of
 the classical decorative style is     
 carried out in the stoneworks now.
