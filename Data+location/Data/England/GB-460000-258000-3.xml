		<title>03 RAILWAYS OF WEEDON BEC</title>
		<content>  The railway through Weedon begins in 
London at {Euston Station} and ended   
originally in Birmingham.Nowadays it is
known as the {West Coast Main Line.}   
  There used to be a station in Weedon 
where a branch line ran to {Leamington 
Spa.}This has been closed for a long   
time.                                  
   The goods siding to the {Royal      
Military Depot} has also been closed   
for a long time.It used to carry guns  
and ammunition into the depot.         
   Today all the passenger trains are  
pulled by electric locomotives and go  
through Weedon at over 100 m.p.h.Some  
goods trains still have diesel         
engines.                               
  There have been two train crashes    
near Weedon.
