		<content> There are five farms in the block each
 with their own farmhouse, but the main
 type of housing is small to medium    
 sized owner occupied. These are       
 mostly bungalows, which have been     
 built in the last twenty years,       
 although there are some two storey    
 homes, most of them built just before 
 or after the Second World War. There  
 are also  small number of houses built
 by the Local Authority. Apart from    
 these there are a few larger          
 properties built during Victorian     
 times and situated along the main A47 
 King's Lynn to Norwich road.          
 Recently there has been a great deal  
 of local concern about the amount of  
 traffic, particularly heavy lorries,  
 passing through the village.          
 Consequently a bypass committee with  
 Middleton has been set up. However    
 some local traders oppose the idea.   </content>
