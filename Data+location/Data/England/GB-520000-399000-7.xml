		<content> The present owner of Priory Farm has  
 lived ther for 20 years but was born  
 at Top Farm, another farm from our    
 block. There has been a change from   
 mixed farming with a large number of  
 sheep, to arable crops including oil  
 seed rape, wheat, sugar beet and      
 beans. In recent years the owner has  
 taken to keeeping a small amount of   
 beef cattle on nearby land which he   
 rents. College Farm at East Ravendale 
 is mainly a dairy farm but the owner  
 does grow qa percentage of crops.     
 Horses are kept for private riding.
