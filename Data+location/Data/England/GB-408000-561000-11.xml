		<title>11GUARDS FARM _ PRUDHOE</title>
		<content> Guards Farm is an intimate treatment  
 centre, S.W. of Prudhoe, where boys   
 and girls, aged 6 to 16, come to spend
 a working holiday and learn           
 discipline.                           
 They spend their time here learning   
 skills; they cut the grass and dry it 
 to keep as food for the animals in the
 winter. They make paths through the   
 woodlands with small log bridges which
 they build themselves. they do not    
 have many animals but those they do   
 have are kept as pets, these include  
 donkeys, goats, ducks and rabbits.    
 They have also made their own market  
 garden in which they grow potato and  
 bean crops which are given to people  
 in need.
