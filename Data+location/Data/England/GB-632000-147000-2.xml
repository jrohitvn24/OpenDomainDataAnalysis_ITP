		<title>02The FIVE BELLS Public House</title>
		<content> The{"Five Bells"}is situated in       
 Ringwould, on the A258.   The         
 Landlord,{Charles Rowney,}is an       
 ex-fireman and has owned the pub for  
 two years.   His wife cooks the meals 
 which are served in the bar.   Mr     
 Rowney says that his regular customers
 come from Mongeham, Deal and St.      
 Margarets.   Few villagers seem to use
 the pub.   There are neither          
 children's facilities nor garden at   
 present, but these are planned for the
 near future.   The Landlord says his  
 most popular drink is Bass, a premium 
 bitter beer.   The opening hours are  
 from 10.30am to 2.30pm and from 6pm to
 11pm on Mondays to Saturdays, and on  
 Sunday from 12pm to 2pm and 7pm to    
 10.30pm.   Two occasional bar staff   
 are employed and there are public and 
 saloon bars.                          
                                       </content>
