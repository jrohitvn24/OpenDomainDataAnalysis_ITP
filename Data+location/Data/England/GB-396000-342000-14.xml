		<content>   School meals are not cooked at our  
school but come from the High School at
Cheadle.We have a cafeteria stlye meal 
which means we have a choice of two    
meals. After lunch we go into the      
playground and play football and       
sometimes we ride our bikes.           
   During the afternoon we either make 
something in craft or do art work based
on the topic work we are doing. For the
Domesday Project we made a 3D large    
map of village in card and plaster of  
paris.After another break we would     
continue with topic work or do P.E. We 
go home at 3:45pm. On a Monday I go to 
Cubs at Wetley Rocks, another village  
down the road. On other days I watch   
childrens T.V. or take 'Tuffty' my     
neighbours dog for a walk. I have my   
super, feed my hamster, watch T.V.     
until 9:00pm when I get undressed,     
clean my teeth,wash and go to bed.     </content>
