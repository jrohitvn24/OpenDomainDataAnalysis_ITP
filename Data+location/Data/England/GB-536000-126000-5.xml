		<title>05Halls for the village to use</title>
		<content>    In Horsted Keynes, there are a few 
 halls for public use. One is called   
 the Village Hall because the whole    
 village is allowed to use it. The hall
 can be hired from the Post Office for 
 discos, wedding receptions, parties   
 and meetings. Organisations which meet
 there regularly include the Brownies, 
 the Playschool, the Ivy Leaf Club, the
 W.I., the Parish Council and the Youth
 Club.                                 
    The Congregational Hall has been   
 used for youth fellowship meetings and
 camps. The village doctors' surgery   
 is held there on Wednesday and Friday 
 mornings.  The primary school has a   
 hall that is sometimes used by people 
 in the village. A lot of people belong
 to the British Legion Club which meets
 in its own building. Public coffee    
 mornings are held at the village green
 Mission.                              </content>
