		<content> A compact, fully equipped{Oncology    
{Unit}provides all necessary facilities
 for the comprehensive treatment of    
 malignant disease.  Patients are      
 referred by G.Ps. and after specialist
 examination are treated by the radio- 
 therapist who uses a computer planner 
 to prescribe suitable radiation. Those
 requiring smaller 'doses' of radiation
 are admitted to the machine which     
 discharges 75-250 kilo volts, while   
 the remainder are treated on the{     
{Linear Accelerator.} The treatment is 
 quick and painless.  Some patients do 
 experience discomfort from the awkward
 positions sometimes necessary for     
 accurate treatment.  For face cancer a
 transparent mould of the face is made 
 to avoid movement during treatment.   
 Patients are treated in a closed room 
 while the radiotherapist operates from
 outside using closed circuit T.V.     </content>
