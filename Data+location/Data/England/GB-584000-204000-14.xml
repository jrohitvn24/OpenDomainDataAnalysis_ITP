		<title>14SAILMAKERS</title>
		<content>   The River Blackwater is well known  
 for its barges and their sails are    
 still made in Maldon.                 
   On the Hythe is Taylors the sail-   
 makers.The firm has been there for    
 over one hundred years.The sail loft  
 is made of weatherboarding and was    
 built in 1709 and was originally a    
 grainstore.The sails are still made   
 traditionally.We watched Roy Howe and 
 John Raven sewing sails by hand and   
 using a machine.Mr Raven has worked   
 there for thirty years and his grand- 
 father for 66 years before him.Mr     
 Raven works at the same bench as his  
 grandfather and still uses some of his
 tools.                                
   Taylors make sails for all kinds of 
 boats.They make and repair the sails  
 for the Thames sailing barges from    
 flax which is dyed with ochre and oil.
 Sailmaking is an important feature.   </content>
