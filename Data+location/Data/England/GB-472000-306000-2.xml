		<title>02FARMING IN NORTH-EAST LEICS.</title>
		<content>  The totally{rural}nature of this area
 of productive land means that the most
 important activity for the population 
 is farming with almost all the{working
{population}employed directly or       
 indirectly by it.                     
  The farms vary in{size}from          
 smallholdings of a few acres to much  
 larger units up to 1200 acres.The     
 farms are mainly family owned, being  
 passed from one generation to the     
 next,thus giving the area a{stable    
{population.                           
  The main farming type can be         
 classified as{"mixed farming"}with all
 farms keeping livestock of some       
 kind.There are several specialist     
 dairy farms, a donkey stud farm and   
 the rest of the farms grow a mixture  
 of cash and fodder crops and rear     
 animals for meat and wool.
