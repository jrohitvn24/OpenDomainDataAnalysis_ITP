		<title>14POLITICAL ATTITUDES</title>
		<content> A number of people were stopped in the
 street and asked about their political
 affiliations. Many refused to answer, 
 but of those that did, 75% voted in   
 general elections and only 50% in     
 local elections for County            
 Councillors. This indicated a general 
 apathy for politics which the people  
 of Carclaze seem to share with the    
 British public in general. When asked 
 why they tended to turn out for       
 general rather than local elections,  
 most said that Parliament has overall 
 power and local Councils are          
 subordinate.                          
                                       
 Despite St.Austell being in the centre
 of the china clay industry, there is  
 little support for the Labour Party.  
 50% of the respondents voted          
 conservative, 36% Liberal, and 16%    
 Labour. The local MP is a Liberal.    </content>
