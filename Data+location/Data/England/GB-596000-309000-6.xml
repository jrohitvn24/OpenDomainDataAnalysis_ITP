		<content>   The majority of firms on this estate
 only employ one or two people and they
 are housed in special start up units. 
 These units contain basic services and
 are offered on low rental. A wide     
 variety of products are produced here 
 such as fibre glass mouldings and     
 various light engineering concerns. It
 is hoped that some of these firms will
 expand and take on extra workers but  
 at the present time a number of units 
 are unoccupied and several firms have 
 closed down in recent years.          
 On this same estate, an Industrial    
 Training Centre was opened by the     
 council in 1984 to provide technical  
 training for school leavers. At       
 present over 60 youngsters are        
 enrolled on these one year courses in 
 the hope that they will be better     
 equipped to find a job.
