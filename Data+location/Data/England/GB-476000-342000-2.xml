		<title>02The transport in the area</title>
		<content> Although transport is somewhat limited
 it has in general improved in recent  
 years.There is a daily bus service    
 which consists of a once a day service
 to Newark,Nottingham,or Bingham (the  
 main shopping towns in the area).There
 is access to several railway stations 
 close by.There is a small frieght line
 which connects Newark and Grantham on 
 a single line track.This used to be   
 used only for transporting locally    
 mined gypsum but as this is now       
 transported mainly by road the line   
 only transports fuel.Most residents   
 have use of at least 1 car per home as
 this is the best way for residents to 
 travel for commuting to and from work,
 for shopping or for social activities.
 There is some use for cycle transport 
 but mainly for pleasure.
