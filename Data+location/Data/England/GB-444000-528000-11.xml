		<content> The eastern part of the area is used  
 by people from the town in their spare
 time. Riding is popular especially    
 with young girls and boys and in      
 addition to the riding schools, horses
 are stabled on many farms.            
 People use the area for walking or    
 jogging and in season enjoy collecting
 blackberries. It is also a good area  
 for exercising dogs.                  
 Children use the area as a playground;
 enjoying such pastimes as stream      
 jumping or playing on "tarzies"(ropes 
 tied to a tree). Some areas are used  
 as  trials courses for motor-bikes or 
 BMX bikes.                            
 Some people enjoy bird-watching while 
 others use dogs and guns to go        
 hunting.
