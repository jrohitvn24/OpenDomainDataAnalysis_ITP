		<title>04ADDERLEY CANAL LOCKS</title>
		<content> Mr Butter has looked after the locks  
 since 1979.He used to be a farm worker
 and it was a challenge for him to come
 and work on the locks.He looks after  
 4 miles of water from Wests Bridge to 
 Bettonwood.The towpath is clean all   
 the time.He has to do a lot of work   
 to keep them tidy.He has to keep the  
 rabbits out so they wont burrow into  
 the canal and cause flooding.He       
 greases the collars of the paddles so 
 that they open easily.The locks are   
 made out of Elm because they wont rot 
 as quickly but the beams are made out 
 of Oak.They should last fifty years   
 and were last replaced in 1975.In Mr  
 Butters stretch each lock drops 6     
 feet.He has 6 locks to look after.
