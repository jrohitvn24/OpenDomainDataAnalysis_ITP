		<content>   MOST PEOPLE, BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS,   
 LIKE TO WEAR JEANS AND SWEATSHIRTS AS 
 THEIR EVERYDAY CLOTHES. THEY ARE      
 BOTH                                  
 WARM AND COMFORTABLE. NOW THAT SUMMER 
 IS HERE LIGHT COLOURS FOR GIRLS ARE   
 VERY FASHIONABLE,FOR EXAMPLE A LEMON  
 CAT-SUIT WHICH IS A PAIR OF COTTON    
 PANTS JOINED WITH A BLOUSE OR A THIN  
 LINED PINK JACKET AND A PALE BLUE     
 BACK-LESS BLOUSE, WHEREAS BOYS LIKE TO
 WEAR THEIR TROUSERS AND PLAIN         
 T-SHIRTS.                             
   IN THE EARLY 1900'S SOME WOMEN HAD  
 THEIR WAISTS AROUND 12", WHICH IS LESS
 THAN HALF THE AVERAGE WOMAN'S WAIST   
 TODAY. ALL WOMEN ARE PARTICULAR ABOUT 
 THE CLOTHES THEY WEAR. ARE THEY TOO   
 OLD-FASHIONED? IS MY BLOUSE CREASED?  
 ALL WOMEN ARE FASHION CONSCIOUS BUT   
 YOUNG MEN DO NOT APPEAR TO WORRY TOO  
 MUCH ABOUT HOW THEY LOOK!             </content>
