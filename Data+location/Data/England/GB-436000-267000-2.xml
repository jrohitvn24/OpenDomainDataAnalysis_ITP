		<content>   Before school I have to see my      
 pony to make sure he is alright.I go  
 back and get ready for school then go 
 to the bus stop.At school I do Maths, 
 English, HE, PE, Swimming, Geography, 
 Science, and a few other things.My    
 teacher is called Mr.Nutt.After school
 I ride my pony either in the field or 
 on the road.My pony is called         
 Speckles.I usually go out with my     
 friend Sally.When I have ridden I go  
 and have my tea and give my girth a   
 rub with saddle soap because it is    
 hard to clean.My Mum is called Isobell
 and she is 33yrs of age,she works as a
 nurse at Weston Hospital 3 days a     
 week.My Dad works at Stratford as a   
 mechanic.His name is Bob and he is 36 
 yrs old.My sister is called Lucy and  
 is 7.She often has a ride on Speckles.
