		<content> At Raybould's Farm there are lots of  
 varieties of cows. There are Jerseys, 
 Fresians, Charolaise, Ayrshire,       
 Belgian-blues, Aquitaines, British    
 Friesians, Brown Swiss, British       
 Whites, Guernseys, Herefords,         
 Simmentills and Welsh blacks. There is
 one bull called Philip. There are 10  
 calves they are Fresians and there is 
 one jersey calf. They milk the mother 
 Jersey. The milking shed is always    
 clean. Most farms have milking        
 machines, but sometimes cows are      
 milked by hand. A piglet weighs less  
 than three pounds when it is born, but
 grows quickly. At six months it may   
 weigh jas much as 160 pounds.
