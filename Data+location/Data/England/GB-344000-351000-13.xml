 Tilston village green is in the centre
 of the village. It has a beautiful    
 chestnut tree in the middle. Mr. Tyrie
 planted the tree 30 years ago.        
 Children collect conkers from the tree
 in the autumn. Nearby are ancient     
 stone{stocks.}Teenagers meet there    
 and deposit litter there. Next to the 
 stocks are two wooden seats. On the   
 village green can be found the two    
 village pubs, the FOX AND HOUNDS and  
 the CARDEN ARMS. The FOX AND HOUNDS   
 has been named because the hunt meet  
 there. The CARDEN ARMS is named after 
 Carden Hall owned by the{Leche}family.
 Carden Hall was destroyed by fire in  
 1913. Bank Farm has dairy cows. At the
{"Wakes",}adults and the children have 
 a{"pram"}race to Farndon and back.    
 They dress up in fancy costumes.      </content>
