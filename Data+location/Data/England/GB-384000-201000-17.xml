 Brimscombe School was built in 1840 by
 DAVID RICARDO who also built the      
 church.There were two large classrooms
 to which was added a smaller classroom
 in 1893.The only way into the school  
 is on foot either up a steep path or  
 down steps from the churchyard.Local  
 children attended here until they were
 twelve then thirteen then fourteen.   
 After 1947 children left before       
 reaching twelve to go to a secondary  
 modern school.There is a very small   
 playground and no playing field.It has
 a HEAD TEACHER and two ASSISTAINT     
 TEACHERS for its 3 classes.
