		<title>14LOCAL EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Apart from the cement works and the   
 petroleum storage  depot, at the      
 Wigmore Lane Industrial Complex, most 
 of the employment available in this   
 area is of an agricultural nature.    
 Virtually all the land to the north   
 and south of the Bath Road is owned by
 the Englefield Estate and a small     
 percentage of the local population is 
 employed by the Benyon family.        
 However, most of the working          
 population is employed outside the    
 area, many commuting to Reading, or   
 using Reading as a rail or motorway   
 link for work in London. There is     
 virtually no adult unemployment and   
 little youth unemployment in the area.
