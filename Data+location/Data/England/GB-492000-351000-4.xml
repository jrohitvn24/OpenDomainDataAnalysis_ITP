		<content> Len Houseman who runs the agricultural
 machinery buiness in Leadenham learned
 his trade in a village blacksmith's   
 shop 40 years ago.He then worked a 50 
 hour week for 5/- a week and biked 6  
 miles to and from work.Now he says he 
 works a 70 hour week but at least he  
 lives next door.Coming to Leadenham 20
 years ago,he worked alone for the     
 first year.Now he employs 12 people   
 and has extended the workshop behind  
 the old smithy.Even this has been     
 outgrown and a 6000sq ft extension is 
 being built over the road.This will   
 mean more jobs.Len's son who has      
 worked there for 7 years will take    
 over when Len retires.Local labour is 
 used and local craftsmen are building 
 the extension.All types of Agric.     
 machinery are made,harrows,cultivators
 steerage hoes etc.Many are made for   
 a St. Neots and Grantham firm.        </content>
