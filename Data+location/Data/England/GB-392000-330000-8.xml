St. Rufin's Church is the only place of
worship in this area. Holy Communion is
celebrated on the second Sunday in each
month. The only other services being   
those in connection with Church        
Festivals.                             
                                       
The church is registered for Baptisms  
but not for Marriages or Funerals.     
There is no burial ground. The Rector  
is responsible for four village        
churches in Sandon, Hopton, Salt and   
Burston.                               
                                       
Its name is taken from the belief that 
Burston was the site of St. Chad's cell
at the time of the conversion of the   
King of Mercia's sons Wulfad and Rufin 
to Christianity.
