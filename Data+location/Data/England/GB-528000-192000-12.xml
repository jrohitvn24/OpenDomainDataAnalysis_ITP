		<content>{Arts and Crafts: }Many local societies
 of Art and Crafts exist here, so      
 people are very keen to develop their 
 talents.  Exhibitions are held        
 regularly both indoors and out though 
 Broomfield House cannot be used for   
 this since it was burnt last year.    
{Landscape:}From Selborne Road you can 
 see right across to the Telecom Tower.
  The New River flows through the area 
 and a stream called Pymmes Brook.  In 
 Ullswater Road the Council want to cut
 down the plane trees because they     
 think the roots may cause damage to   
 the houses.  Some of the residents are
 fighting to keep them by legal action 
 and we awaiting the outcome.
