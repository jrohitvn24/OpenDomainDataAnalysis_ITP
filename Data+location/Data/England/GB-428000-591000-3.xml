		<content>{The Policeman.}                       
  The community policeman for our area 
 is P.C. Colin Summerscales. He is     
 based at Broomhill Police Station     
 along with six other policeman.       
{Crime.}                               
  So far this year there has been no   
 real increase in crime. The main      
 crimes in this area are burglaries    
 which can be split into two main      
 groups, dwellings and taking without  
 consent. We do not get any serious    
 crime in this area most people are law
 abiding especially the older people.  
 It is mainly the younger people who   
 carry out the crimes.                 
{Theft.}                               
  Because of the fact that there is not
 enough policeman in the area it is    
 difficult to keep thefts under        
 control.
