		<title>05THE BUTCHERS SHOPIN LANGTOFT</title>
		<content> A butcher is someone who mainly sells 
 meat but our butcher who is called    
 Trevor sells,sausage,cheese,yogurt    
 eggs,crabsticks and stuffing.         
 Crabsticks are about 8cm long and are 
 sticks of fish with a crab flavouring.
 Stuffing is used to keep the meat     
 moist while it is cooking the stuffing
 also tastes nice.The product that he  
 sells most of is beef.The busiest days
 of the week are Friday and Saturday.  
 Trevor said he did not need any       
 special training to be a butcher he   
 started at school and worked his way  
 up.He also said the thing he liked    
 most about being a butcher was meeting
 people.When you walk in the shop on   
 the left is a counter where he        
 displays cheese,yogurt and pies the   
 counter is like a fridge that keeps   
 things cool. To cut the meat he has an
 a laege wooden block and many knives. </content>
