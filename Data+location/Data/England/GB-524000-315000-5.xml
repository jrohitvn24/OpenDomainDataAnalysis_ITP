		<title>05THE RIVER WELLAND</title>
		<content>      The River Welland runs           
 slowly through our area from Crowland 
 to Spalding,with its original source  
 in Northamptonshire and its mouth     
 flows into the Wash.At Cowbit the     
 Welland is 30m wide and 5m deep.      
      The main use of the Welland is   
 for land drainage as in 1947 Cowbit   
 Wash flooded,thus the present Barrier 
 Bank .Fishing is also a major         
 attraction.The present rod licence is 
 Â£1.50. The local yacht club uses this 
 section of the river and anyone taking
 a motorised boat on the river needs a 
 licence.                              
      Irrigation is also a main        
 facility of the Welland and the river 
 banks are an important conservation   
 area.With the Welland being so clean  
 it is the home for a great variety of 
 wild life.                            
                                       </content>
