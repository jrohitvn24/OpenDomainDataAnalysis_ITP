		<title>11Alfred Mizen of Mitcham</title>
		<content> Our school, which is named after      
 Alfred Mizen, was built in 1934 on    
 ground which may have been used as an 
 orchard or a golf course.             
{Mr.Alfred Mizen J.P.}who died in      
 1946 at the age of 84, was the last of
 3 brothers who were well known market 
 gardeners in Mitcham. The nursery was 
 started by their father on a site     
 which is now part of Battersea Park.  
 Later, until 1933,they farmed 200     
 acres in Mitcham where Lonesome and   
 Eastfields Schools now are.One of the 
 Mizen's houses was pulled down in 1984
 to make way for a new building estate 
 called"The Firs" in Grove Rd.         
 The family were great benefactors to  
 Mitcham churches and attended St.Marks
 and St.Olaves.They were interested in 
 education. Miss Alfreda Mizen gave us 
 money to build our own swimming pool.
