<title>27Kemsing - a Downland Village</title>
<content>

Despite an explosion of building and population since the war, this village nestling at the foot of the North Downs still displays great natural beauty with farming and arable land a predominant feature. &lt;br />&lt;br />As in other Kentish villages, thanks to conservation, the St.Edith's Well &amp; other Listed Buildings of Kemsing is protected, therefore retaining some of its history and old world charm. &lt;br />&lt;br />Typical of similar communities, the need to work on the land has diminished and people mainly commute to surrounding towns and London for work. Leisure time is spent tending gardens, enjoying the surrounding countryside or attending one or more of the varied clubs/societies which have proved so beneficial in bringing the people together to form a good community spirit.   &lt;br />  &lt;br />
