		<content>What fears do the people of Dartford   
have?                                  
People were interviewed about the sorts
of things that frightened them.        
The children were most frightened at   
the thought of war.Their next most     
common fears were concerned with the   
possibility of murder. A few children  
expressed fears of such things as      
spiders,  snakes,rats and ghosts       
although such fears were not based on  
any real exerience.                    
Most adults were concerned about       
nuclear war and the possibility of     
being attacked on the streets.         
An 11 year old boy writes"I am worried 
that if a nuclear missile hit Greenham 
Common it would blow up the whole of   
England.I am also worried that Dartford
may be flooded again"
