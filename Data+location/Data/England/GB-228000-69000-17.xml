		<content> My name is{Ashley Michael Smith.}I    
 live in a bungalow near our school. My
 Dad works for the Ministry of Defence 
 but my Mum does not work. She stops at
 home and cleans and does odd jobs     
 around the house. Our home is in quite
 good condition and we are hardly ever 
 short of anything. We are a happy     
 family but we do argue sometimes. Most
 Sundays we take a walk in the woods or
 go fishing at the beach.              
 My name is{Nathan John Hicks.}I get up
 each Tuesday at 0800 hrs and go to    
 school which starts at 0900 hrs. We   
 have Assembly, Maths, Reading and     
 English in the morning. I have a      
 school dinner. My favourite is fish   
 and chips followed by ice cream. After
 dinner we do Poetry, Nature and Games.
 In the winter we do football and in   
 summer cricket and athletics. School  
 finishes at 1545 hrs and I go home.   </content>
