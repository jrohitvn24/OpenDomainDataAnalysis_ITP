		<content>  On Sunday I  get up at 9.00am.At     
 10.00am there is a pigeon shoot.After 
 that we have sandwiches.My dad serves 
 behind the bar in the pub.We sell     
 drinks and meals.The pub closes at    
 4.00pm.Sunday is a busy day.Then we   
 have our tea.Sometimes I play with    
 Katy while my mum does the            
 washing.Then I  watch television.At   
 9.30pm I  go to bed but mum and dad   
 have to serve in the bar until        
 11.30pm.My mum or the chef prepares   
 and cooks the food in our pub.My      
 favourite food is fish and chips.On   
 Sunday we had chicken,carrots,cabbage,
 potatoes,and Yorkshire puddings.I have
 a hampster called Sandy and a cat     
 called Smudge.I also have a dog called
 Milly.Sometimes she acts silly.
