		<title>14My Hobbies</title>
		<content> One of my hobbies is collecting       
 badges. I have 52 badges my favourite 
 being a metal badge with a bird on it 
 with Liverpool Football Club sign. I  
 have been collecting for a year now. I
 go to castles, beaches and other      
 places like that to buy them. Some    
 badges I send off for, 4 badges I got 
 from joining a club. I also enjoy     
 football. I am one of the best in my  
 school. Our team colours are blue top 
 and blue shorts. Our team has only    
 beaten 2 other teams, they are        
 Dunsford and Spreyton Primary Schools.
 I also like BMX-ing, a BMX  is a tough
 bike that you do stunts on. I have had
 it for a year now and I can do some   
 clever tricks on it.
