		<content> CONOCO OIL COMPANY'S SEISMIC TESTS    
 INDICATE THE{POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF AN 
{OIL RESERVOIR}BETWEEN BUXTED AND      
 MAYFIELD. THEY HAVE APPLIED FOR       
 PLANNING PERMISSION TO DRILL A        
 BOREHOLE IN THE VICINITY.THIS IS      
 CAUSING THE POPULATION IN THE AREA    
 GREAT CONCERN. APPROVAL WOULD MEAN    
 INCREASED LORRY TRAFFIC WHICH COULD   
 AMOUNT TO{1000%.}THE DAMAGE TO AN AREA
 CLASSIFIED AS ONE OF EXCEPTIONAL      
 NATURAL BEAUTY WOULD BE DISASTROUS.THE
 DANGER TO RESIDENTS DUE TO TRAFFIC    
 MOVEMENTS IS HORRIFYING. THESE FACTORS
 WOULD BE GREATLY EXACERBATED SHOULD   
 CONSTRUCTION OF A GATHERING STATION   
 PROVE VIABLE. THE MAIN CONCERN OF THE 
 DISTRICT COUNCIL TO DATE IS THE LACK  
 OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON SUCH FUTURE
 EXPLOITATION WITH THE CONSEQUENT      
 SOCIAL DISTRESS AND UPHEAVAL.THE      
 APPLICATION IS BEING INVESTIGATED.    </content>
