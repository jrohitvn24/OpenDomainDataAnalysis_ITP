		<title>18Interview with the Mayor</title>
		<content> We interviewed Councillor Johnson who 
 is the new Mayor of Cambridge.He has  
 lived in Cherry Hinton for nearly 21  
 years.He says that the village of     
 Cherry Hinton was much smaller and    
 more compact when he moved in and he  
 liked it like that.Since he moved in  
 there has been a lot of building of   
 houses,shops and factories.Cherry     
 Hinton is much noisier now than it    
 used to be and he would like less     
 traffic in the village.He likes Cherry
 Hinton a lot.He lives in a bungalow   
 which was built in 1964.The bungalow  
 is set well back from the road so he  
 does not hear very much of the noise.
