		<content> We interviewed our school cleaner, who
 first came to Compton when the        
 railwayfrom Didcot to Southampton was 
 still running .When she came to the   
 school they had four classes and      
 teachers.She had reading writing and  
 arithmetic lessons and also learnt    
 knitting and sewing. We have more play
 space now,but then there were separate
 playgrounds for girls and boys.       
 When the bell rang at 08.55 they had  
 hymn singing.In the two hour lunch    
 time most pupils went home.School     
 ended at 16.30.The classrooms were lit
 by oil lamps and heated by solid fuel 
 stoves.They had no running water, and 
 had to fetch water from the well in   
 the Schoolhouse garden.She thinks that
 on the whole Compton has become a     
 better place over the year.
