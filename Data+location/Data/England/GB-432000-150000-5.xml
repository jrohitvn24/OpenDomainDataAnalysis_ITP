		<title>05MR CHAPPLE, HAMPSHIRE GAME</title>
		<content> On the land near Redhouse Farm is a   
 large metal barn owned by Mr Chapple  
 which contains many large             
 freezers.These hold great numbers of  
 frozen game which are exported mainly 
 to France and Belgium.There are 4     
 buildings on his five acres of land   
 and Mr Chapple has lived here for 8   
 years.His part-time workers travel    
 up to 50 miles to collect the game    
 which comes from Dorset, Hampshire,   
 Sussex,Somerset and Wiltshire.He      
 freezes 100,000 pheasants and 20,000  
 rabbits and 3,000 deer in a normal    
 year.A typical day is packing any dead
 game for export or freezing any       
 new game which has been collected.The 
 business is based in this area because
 the game is of good quality and       
 plentiful. Their future plans are to  
 expand on the same site with another  
 large barn.                           </content>
