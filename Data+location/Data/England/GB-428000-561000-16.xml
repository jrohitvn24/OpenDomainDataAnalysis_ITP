 Lollipop ladies are people who help   
 you cross the road.They can only cross
 children.They wear a uniform which is 
 bright and has to show a badge.In the 
 summer they can wear a white overall. 
 Also all the time they have to have a 
 lollipop stick which is in the shape  
 of a lollipop and has the word STOP   
 printed on.There are three lollipop   
 ladies around our school.I asked one  
 of them ssome questions.She told me   
 she has been working for nine years   
 and enjoys her and likes her pay. She 
 makes lots of friends and gets to know
 people who pass in their cars.If there
 are any roadworks they obstruct the   
 traffic and make the lollipop lady    
 watch two lots of traffic.The bus can 
 cause problems because the cars behind
 can't see in front.Any accident has to
 be reported by the lollipop lady.     </content>
