		<title>15LYME REGIS TOWN COUNCIL</title>
		<content> Lyme Regis Town Council looks after   
 and is in charge of various things in 
 Lyme.  Council and Committee meetings 
 take place in the Guildhall.  The     
 different Committees are: Planning,   
 Grounds and Gardens, Marine Theatre   
 Management, Recreations, Publicity and
 Advertising, Finance and General      
 Purposes.                             
 The Council consists of a Mayor, Town 
 Clerk and Councillors.  The Town Clerk
 is a full-time job while the others   
 are all part time and are voted into  
 their seats.  The Mayor chairs the    
 meetings.  The Mayor has a special    
 outfit as does the Clerk, for special 
 occasions and ceromonies.  The Clerk  
 looks after the town by collecting the
 rent and telling councillors their    
 positions.  The councillors look after
 town property e.g. car park, mini     
 golf, gardens and playing fields.     </content>
