		<content> When we get to school we play football
 until the bell goes. We hang our coats
 up and go into the class-room.After   
 prayers we sit down to read. Mrs.     
 Everson took our group for maths today
 and we finished Book 3. After maths we
 have playtime. We play football. After
 play we had a spelling test until     
 music.At music we sing and play the   
 descant recorder. We are also learning
 to play the treble recorder. We both  
 bring a packed lunch to school and we 
 eat it in the dining hall with the    
 children who have school lunches.     
 After lunch it's play and then we go  
 swimming at Marshalswick School. After
 the warm up we practise for the Junior
 Swimmers Award. Near the end of the   
 lesson we have free-time. We get back 
 to school and Mrs.Everson reads us a  
 story until hometime. At home we play,
 eat and watch T.V until  bedtime.     </content>
