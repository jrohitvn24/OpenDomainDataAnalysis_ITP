		<content>Mrs Calcutt's house was built in 1949  
and was the first house on her side of 
the road.In Combe mains electricity was
installed in 1934, water a year later  
and sewage in 1965/1970 (there are no  
gasmains in Combe).There isn't a police
or fire station in Combe but there used
to be a policeman. There is a mobile   
shop that comes on Fridays, a fish man 
comes on Thursdays and a fish &amp; chip   
van on Wednesday. They have a mobile   
library on Thursday and a video hire on
Fridays. They used to have three shops 
but now they don't have any. They don't
have any garages which service cars or 
sell petrol so they have to go to a    
garage near Woodstock.They dont have   
aimes we use the computer or watch     
schools programmes on the TV.At 10.30we
play on the playground or field for 15 
minutes.At 3pm a bell rings &amp; we walk  
or bus home.(C.NIZIOL &amp; K.WHITE).      </content>
