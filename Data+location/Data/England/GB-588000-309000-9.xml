 We get up around 7.70a.m. and         
 breakfast is at 8.15 with a snack     
 lunch at 12.30 and a cooked meal at   
 5pm.  Tidying the bungalow, making    
 beds and cleaning the bathroom is done
 daily.  Floors are cleaned with an    
 electric vacuum cleaner.  Dirty       
 clothes are washed in a washing       
 machine and ironed with an electric   
 iron.  Usually the washing is dried   
 outside but when the weather is wet an
 electric tumble drier is used.  Meals,
 cakes etc. are cooked in an electric  
 oven with rings on top for saucepans. 
 Once a week I go shopping for food.   
 Floweres, vegetables and fruit are    
 grown in the garden some of which are 
 frozen so that they can be eaten in   
 the winter months.  Knitting,sewing   
 and decorating are done by me to help 
 stretch the widows pension received.  </content>
