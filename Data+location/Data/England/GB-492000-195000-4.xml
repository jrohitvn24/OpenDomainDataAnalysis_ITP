		<content> Reports are typed on different colours
 for each department _ agenda (white), 
 planning (gold), housing (mauve),     
 amenities (blue), policy and finance  
 (green), environmental health (cream).
 The planning department has about 2000
 applications a year.Records have been 
 kept since 1948.We saw a room full of 
 files,but they are being micro-filmed 
 and stored in computers.              
 Computer terminals are now being in-  
 stalled in most departments,with links
 to Aylesbury and Chesham.Because the  
 information is valuable,the windows of
 the computer room are barred;a burglar
 alarm has been fitted;the tapes are   
 stored in a virtually indestuctable   
 cabinet;and there is an emergency back
 up system in case of power failure.   
 A franking machine is used for postage
 and a credit card of Â£1000 lasts for  
 only two weeks!                       </content>
