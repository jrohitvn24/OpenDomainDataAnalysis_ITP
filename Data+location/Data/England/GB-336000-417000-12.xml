 weekly, Wednesday's edition being     
 delivered free to each house, and     
 Friday's costing 18p.Here is a summary
 of local news on June 5th 1985.       
 There was plenty of bad news, such as 
 a disabled girl dying in a house fire,
 and a jogger being hit by a car while 
 running on the beach.There is less    
 good news but one example was a local 
 Travel Agent going to Oslo. There are 
 also reports on weddings and funerals.
 There was political news and several  
 descriptions of money-raising         
 events.Additionally, there are reports
 of local clubs and societies, as well 
 as letters from local residents.
