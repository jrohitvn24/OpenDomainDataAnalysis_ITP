		<title>06Changing Times in Kimpton</title>
		<content> After interviewing several life-long  
 inhabitants of the village it         
 is possible to ascertain how the      
 village has changed since 1900.With 7 
 public houses,10 shops,2 breweries and
 a bank it was possible to live        
 entirely in the village.Motor traffic 
 has replaced the horse, causing       
 a parking problem.                    
 Many changes have been good like the  
 building of sheltered accommodation   
 for the elderly:Probyn House. Some    
 were not popular like the demolition  
 of historic buildings to make way for 
 new houses.This interferred with      
 natural drainage causing increased    
 flooding in the High Street,which has 
 not yet been solved.Recently,levelling
 the Recreation Ground for the Football
 Club has left little play-space.To    
 monitor future changes Kimpton        
 Protection Group has been formed.     </content>
