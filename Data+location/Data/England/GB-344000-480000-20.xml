		<content>  The embankment of the now-abandoned  
 Arnside-Kendal railway provides a     
 valuable barrier against flooding east
 of the estuary.                       
 A direct daily service to London is   
 available from Arnside station.       
 There are daily omnibus services to   
 Kendal and Lancaster from the area.   
 The absence of through road routes    
 enhances the tranquillity of the area.
 The Ministry of Transport planned to  
 construct a trunk highway to link the 
 M6 Motorway at Carnforth with the     
 Barrow road near Meathop Moss,        
 crossing the Kent Estuary at Meathop  
 Marsh. Access from this road would    
 have affected all forms of life in the
 area. Following energetic opposition  
 by residents, the Government          
 eventually abandoned the scheme.
