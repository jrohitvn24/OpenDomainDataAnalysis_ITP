		<title>19ST.PHILIP'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Church is just over 30 years old  
 and the foundation stone was laid by  
 the{Duke of Devonshire}in 1954. It has
 a bell tower. The bell is much older  
 than the church and came from Derwent 
 Village before it was flooded to make 
 the Derwent Reservoir in north        
 Derbyshire. The signatures of the     
{Queen and Prince Philip}are in the    
 visitors' book following their visit. 
                                       
 The church holds three services every 
 day as well as special services such  
 as weddings, christenings and         
 funerals. In 1984 there were 21       
 weddings and 16 christenings. There is
 a{Sunday School}which is attended by  
 20 children. The{Church Hall}is used  
 by a playgroup, scouts, cubs, guides  
 and brownies as well as the Evergreen 
 Club (Pensioners) and Ladies' Club.
