		<title>18THE RIVER SEVERN</title>
		<content> The{River Severn}here is more         
 navigable than previously with the    
 building of a weir at Maisemore.      
{Healing's Mill at Tewkesbury}still    
 use three grain barges connecting     
 with{Sharpness.}Also it is used by    
 many{Angling Clubs}e.g. BAA.,Windmill.
 Each year they are given a different  
 stretch of water. The most popular    
 fish are Bleak, Roach and Eels.       
{The Avon Sailing Club}is based        
 at{Chaceley Stock.}It was built in    
 196O. Jo Richards, the{Olympic        
{bronze medalist,}started sailing at   
 the Club. Every Winter as the River   
 Severn rises it causes flooding in and
 around Deerhurst and Apperley. It     
 sometimes freezes over making the     
 situation worse. Some families can be 
 surrounded by the water,only escaping 
 by boat.                              
                                       </content>
