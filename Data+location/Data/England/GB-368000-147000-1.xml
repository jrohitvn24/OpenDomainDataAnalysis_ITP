		<content> The villages on the northern edge of  
 the{Mendip Hills}have long been       
 associated with the mineral resources 
 of the region.     Coal was extracted 
 from  numerous small workings between 
{Mells}and {Coleford} during the 19th  
 century, but the last pit closed down 
 in 1927 and  sadly, little remains of 
 the surface buildings except at       
{Newbury, }and the undulated ground in 
 Melcombe Wood and around Stock Hill.  
        The remains of the{D.&amp; S. Canal
 Branch line, which was to have carried
 coal to{Frome}can be seen in places   
 at{Vobster} and at Coleford  where the
 remains of the  "noble and stupendous'
{aquaduct" }as it was described in 1825
 still stands today,  encrusted in ivy 
 and known locally as the "Hucky Duck".
   Todays riches are the pastureland of
 the many dairy farms and the limestone
 quarried near{Leigh-on-Mendip.        </content>
