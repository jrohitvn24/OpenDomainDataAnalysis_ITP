		<title>17CHURCH AND CUSTOMS R ABBOTT</title>
		<content> The Church of Gittisham is called St. 
 michaels. It has box pews which were  
 installed in 1715.The Nave and        
 Chancel is divided by an arch thought 
 to be built just before 1330 and      
 restored later. We have a Sunday      
 School which is held in the church.   
 Which is run by the mothers.          
 Tip-Tip-toeing is a very old tradition
 inGitisham. It has been going for such
 a long time now that our grandparents 
 cannot tell us when it started. For   
 they also used to go tip-tip-toeing as
 well and it had been going for quite  
 some time then. The children go from  
 door to door saying "Tip-Tip Toe, Tip 
 Tip Toe, Please for a penny and then  
 we'll go." The door opened and give   
 the children a few pence then they go 
 on. This has always been held on      
 Pancake day and the WI give the       
 children tea before they start.       </content>
