		<title>11Watton Priory</title>
		<content> The existing church of St. Mary dates 
 from the 13th Century and stands      
 within the precincts of the Priory    
 (about 42 acres). The rectangular site
 is bounded and intersected by banks   
 and ditches. While the Priory may have
 had Saxon origins, the site is typical
 of Gilbertine monasteries. It is      
 known that a Gilbertine Priory was    
 founded c.1150 by Eustace Fitzjohn,   
 but there is little other information,
 except that upon its surrender in     
 1539/40 the Priory was valued at Â£360.
 The ruins were excavated in 1893 by   
 the East Riding Antiquarian Society.  
 The tenant of the "Abbey" then was Mr.
 Richard Beckitt - there is a memorial 
 window to the Beckitt family in St.   
 Mary's church. The only part of the   
 Priory still in existence formed the  
 Prior's lodging, and this dates to the
 14th and 15th Centuries.              </content>
