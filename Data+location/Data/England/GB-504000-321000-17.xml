		<content> At School we do lots of different     
 crafts.From when I started this School
 I've done lots of sewing.I have done:a
 cuddly toy,a jewellery box,a mat,a    
 needle case,a skirt and lots of other 
 things.We also do weaving.We have only
 just got a new weaving loom for the   
 School.Otherwise we do paper          
 weaving.Sometimes we do collages with 
 scrap pieces of material.Once we made 
 knot gardens with rolled up pieces of 
 coloured tissue paper.It was          
 fun.Sometimes we paint and draw a big 
 picture which all the class have done 
 called a 'frieze'.When we are having a
 jumble sale we make pottery to sell.I 
 have made:a rabbit,a face,a plant pot 
 and a plant pot holder,a mouse and an 
 ordinary pot.We often make pottery    
 for the Easter competition.Some people
 press flowers and make some nice      
 pictures.                             </content>
