		<title>15TEACHERS' ACTION_S.REIGATE</title>
		<content>     From March 1985 the teachers from 
 England and Wales were in dispute with
 their employers.Teaching unions wanted
 a pay settlement equivalent to inflat_
 ion rate plus a contribution towards  
 restoring the 34% loss of earnings    
 since the Houghton award.The employers
 offered various amounts all less than 
 inflation rate and tied to worsened   
 conditions of service.As a result tea_
 chers of both main unions in maintain_
 ed schools in our block withdrew good 
 will.On one half_day in the months of 
 September onwards withdrawal of labour
 was also employed.Teachers of NUT     
 joined in a rally at Dorking Halls on 
 Friday 6th December to mark a visit by
 the Secretary of State to De Stafford 
 School,Caterham (later cancelled) when
 a petition signed by teachers of all  
 unions or none was to have been pre-  
 sented.   Jan 1986 _ still in dispute.</content>
