		<title>01ASHPERTON AND ENVIRONS</title>
		<content> The village of Ashperton is scattered 
 along both sides of a long straight   
 stretch of the A417 following the line
 of a Roman road. Many cars speed      
 through the village but few stop; it  
 is unusual to see people walking along
 this busy road. This is a rural       
 community with its origins in the     
 settlement Spertune in the original   
 Domesday Book. It has the remnants of 
 a village green with a war memorial   
 alongside the village hall. Several   
 half-timbered houses and a square     
 towered church are surrounded on all  
 sides by fields of wheat, potatoes,   
 hops, grassland, and woodland. This   
 village has changed little over many  
 years but is now beginning to feel the
 effect of the movement of townspeople 
 into the country. Some are buying     
 newer houses but more are renovating  
 old cottages.                         </content>
