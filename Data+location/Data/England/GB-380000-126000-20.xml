		<title>20CHANGE: INDUSTRY, GILLINGHAM</title>
		<content>{Industry}has changed a lot since the  
 war.  Then, there were three          
 blacksmiths, two glove{factories,}a   
 slaughter house, brewery, a gasworks, 
 a timber yard, a milk factory called  
 United Dairies, Maloney's glue factory
 and a brickyard, the clay for which   
 was taken from where Lodden Lakes are 
 now.  There was also a sheep and      
 cattle market in Station Road.  Only  
 the blacksmith, Crocker's, and a glove
 factory remain, along with the bacon  
 factory, Oakwood's which has been in  
 existance since 1847.  These old      
 industries have been replaced by new  
 forms of{employment. }The old Hudson  
 and Martin's Sawmill is now Sherman   
 Chemicals.  Gillingham now has two    
 chemical works and a number of        
 engineering factories on the Brick    
 Fields' Estate.
