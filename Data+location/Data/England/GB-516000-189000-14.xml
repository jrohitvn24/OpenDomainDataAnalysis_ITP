		<content>    This information was collected     
 during an interview with the Manager. 
    The cinema opened in 1932, when the
 present Manager was 10.He began work  
 there on Saturday morning shows, but  
 became Assistant Manager full-time in 
 1950. He was appointed Manager in     
 1971.                                 
    He recalls "The Towering Inferno", 
 "The Sting" and, particularly, all the
 Steven Spielberg movies as big money  
 makers. The cinema shows mostly ABC,  
 EMI and Rank films. Competition comes 
 mainly in the form of t.v. and video  
 cassettes.                            
    The theatre operates between 1300  
 and 2245. Important films are shown in
 Studio 1, which has 705 seats. Others 
 are screened in Studios 2 or 3, with  
 207 and 196 seats respectively.       
    The Manager believes the future of 
 the cinema to be very bleak here.     </content>
