		<content>    The main{fish}in the{river}are     
 brown trout and there are also        
 grayling.The salmon and sea-trout are 
 coming back to the river.This makes   
 the river popular with anglers.The    
 trout live from 4 to 5 years and they 
 average 23 cm in length but fish up to
 40 cm have been caught.Minnows,       
 bullheads and stone loach can be      
 found. There are various insects in   
 the river such as Mayfly,Caddis Fly   
 and Creeper (Stone Fly.) Mayfly live  
 in fast streams and soon die if they  
 are kept in water wamer than they are 
 accustomed to.The Creeper's local name
 is Jock.It's Latin name is Perla      
 carlukiana.The Creeper moults and     
 after moulting 30 times in 3 years it 
 surfaces and climbs on the bank.Its   
 skin splits in the middle and the     
 adult stonefly emerges.Freshwater     
 crayfish are becoming more common.    </content>
