		<title>04SCHOOL SUMMER FETE</title>
		<content>On Saturday 22nd. June 1985, Lowerhouse
Junior School held its annual summer   
fete, run by the Parent Teacher        
Association. The morning preparations  
were made in the rain, but the weather 
became much brighter for the fete, It  
opened at 2 p.m. with a performance by 
the Girls' Brigade Band. There were 8  
stalls in the school hall.             
These included, a plant stall, a book  
stall, a handicraft stall, a home-made 
cake stall, a tombola, a raffle ticket 
stand, a toy stall and a white elephant
stall. Our parents were helping on     
stalls. Outside were a pony ride, lots 
of games, including golf, for money    
prizes and photographs taken at the    
wheel of a double-decker bus.          
We raised quite a lot of money and hope
to buy some new things for the pupils.
