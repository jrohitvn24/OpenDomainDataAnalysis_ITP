		<title>15THE CHANGING FACE OF SNAITH</title>
		<content> Snaith is designated as a development 
 area. There has been a great deal of  
 new housing within the last twenty    
 years. The Saffron Estate was build on
 a site known locally as the Showfield.
 It was here that the local            
 agricultural show, Snaith Show, was   
 held. It is now held at the village of
 Gowdall. Development is currently     
 taking place next to the church on the
 Priory Site.                          
 As the centre of Snaith contains so   
 many listed buildings there is only a 
 limited scope for commercial          
 development. Recent additions to      
 shopping facilities have included a   
 cycle shop, a video rental shop, a    
 Chinese Takeaway and an Estate Agents.
 A Brewery has recently opened in Mill 
 Street and trades under the name of   
 the Old Mill Brewery. (Real Ale)
