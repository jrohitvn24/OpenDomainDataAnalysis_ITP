		<title>14FLOWTON AND BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>  Flowton is a small village.It is the 
smallest village in our survey.The     
church roof is made of tiles,the rest  
is of flint and stone.It has a wooden  
gate with a cross on the top of it.The 
church is old and so are some of the   
trees around it.                       
  The Flowton sign has a plough in the 
inside of the square,on top of it is a 
bunch of corn with fancy squiggles     
around it.
