 We asked 100 children between 7 and 11
 years about the games that they       
 played. The most popular game was     
 'Kerbs'; two people stand on the      
 opposite sides of the road.  You throw
 a ball at the kerb.If it hits and     
 bounces back you score a point.  The  
 first one to get 5 points is the      
 winner.                               
 Another popular game was              
 'T.V.Programmes'; About 5 people play 
 this game.  One boy tells the others  
 the day and time a programme is on. If
 someone guesses it right it is his    
 turn to pick a programme for the      
 others to guess.                      
 Other games were 'Kick the Tin',      
 Football,' Escape', 'Hidey' and       
 'British Bulldog'.
