		<title>16CHILHAM.ST MARY'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> It is thought that there was a Church 
 at Chilham before the Norman Conquest 
 in 1066,but no part of this remains   
 today.The present Church dates        
 originally from about 1300 A.D. and   
 was extended later about 1450 A.D.    
 The battlement tower of flint and Caen
 stone is typical of many Churches in  
 Kent.It is 68ft high and has a        
 splendid view.In the church yard there
 is a huge yew tree.Nobody knows how   
 old it is. Tradition has it that      
 the tree is twice as old as the       
 church. This old tree is decorated at 
 Christmas time with electric lights   
 and carols are sung underneath it. The
 oldest gravestone is near the south   
 east corner of the church and is dated
 1638 .There are stained glass windows,
 a font and decorated tombs inside the 
 church.The church attracts many       
 visitors throughout the year.         </content>
