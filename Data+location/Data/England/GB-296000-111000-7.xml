		<content>  The{M.D.E.A.}in Tiverton is run      
 full-time by a manager and an         
 assistant. It is{sponsored by local   
{firms,}e.g. the brewery, the textile  
 factory, banks, solicitors and small  
 businesses. Situated in the textile   
 factory's grounds, the centre is for  
 people who've been made{redundant}and 
 want to find work, setting up their   
 own business or carrying on with a    
 particular trade. The centre helps all
 age groups, covering around{60        
{different trades,}ranging from scrap  
 metal to businessmen to forestry.     
  Applicants are usually sent on from  
 the{Job Centre.}During the last 12    
 months 311 people have been           
 interviewed and all have found work.  
 Applicants prefer the{atmosphere}of   
 the{Enterprise Agency}because it is   
 more personal and it is possible to   
 have a one hour interview.            </content>
