		<title>04WOODLAND - BROCKWORTH AREA</title>
		<content>Brockworth Wood is at the top of       
Coopers Hill.It is a small {wood} but  
has a rich variety of {animals} and    
{birds} - "{Squirrels} roam the trees  
but I've never seen a woodpecker" said 
a local. Most of the trees are {beech} 
but a wide variety of {shrub and       
{brush} provides suitable food and     
cover. With the felling of trees it    
becomes easier to spot {badgers,foxes  
and rabbits.}An old quarry has been    
revealed too. The floor of the wood is 
soft and mossy giving off the smell of 
rotting wood. There are lots of        
{flowers} at the moment with a sea of  
bluebells,as well as primrose,violet   
and the cuckoo pint. Cowslips are to   
be seen just before entering the wood  
above Brockworth. Sighted that day-25  
{rabbits},6 {hares},10 {shrews},20     
{fieldmice} and 10 {adders}.
