		<title>09ST PATRICK'S JUNIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> School starts at 9.15 and  finishes at
 3.30.The radiators, blackboards and   
 desks are old fashioned.The library is
 old fashioned and there are hardly any
 good books. Our school is terrible and
 they are hoping to build a new one but
 it may be many years before the county
 council has enough money to pay for   
 it. We have a BBC computer and we have
 just bought a video. At our school we 
 dont get the cane. For punishment we  
 get lines, we miss play time and if we
 are really bad  we get hit with Mr.   
 Youngs trainer.There is not really any
 rivalry in school and the atmosphere  
 is quite good.  Most people are quite 
 friendly but sometimes the boys pick  
 on the girls a bit. Recently there has
 been some stealing in school of money 
 and a tractor. But really our school  
 is all right.
