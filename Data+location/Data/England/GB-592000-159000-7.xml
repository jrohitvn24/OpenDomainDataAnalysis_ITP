		<content> My sisters and I have breakfast. Linda
 &amp; I usually have an egg on toast.     
 Sometimes we have cereal &amp; then my    
 sister Carol. Anne takes my sister &amp; I
 to the village hall. My sister goes   
 for Robert &amp; they walk down to the bus
 stop &amp; they catch the bus to the Abbey
 School. I get on the coach &amp; then go  
 to school. When we come back at night 
 I have to go to Daniel's house and    
 then my sister will pick me up. Then  
 we go home and my mum will do the tea.
 We might sit up in the caravan and eat
 it or we might sit on the grass and   
 eat it. We have three cars. My brother
 &amp; sister &amp; my dad have a car. We have 
 three caravans. One is 14ft; one is 24
 ft; and one is 36 ft. My brother's is 
 24 ft.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
