		<title>13LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN HONLEY</title>
		<content>   The first tier of local government  
 for our area is the{West Yorkshire    
{Metropolitan County Council}(set up in
 1974). This is divided into 5 second  
 tier areas, ours being{Kirklees Metro.
{District Council.}An option for a     
 third tier was taken up with the{Holme
{Valley Parish Council.}               
   There is much controversy at the    
 moment because of the Conservative    
 Government plans to abolish the Labour
 controlled Metropolitan Counties in   
 1986. The Bill to do so overcame its  
 last hurdle when it was passed by the 
 House of Lords on the 15th July, 1985.
   It is planned that most of the      
 functions performed by the Counties   
 will pass to the District Councils.   
 Others will become the responsibility 
 of special authorities and others may 
 be privatised.
