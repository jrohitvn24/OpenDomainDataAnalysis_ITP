		<content>There are nineteen churches in the     
North Hammersmith area.Most of these   
are in Shepherds Bush.We found that    
most churches were in run down areas   
and housing estates.Four of these      
churches  had modern architecture      
while the others looked very old. The  
main church is the Church of           
England(C.E). There are quite a few of 
these churches in the area.There are a 
couple of Catholic churches.This is    
probably due to a large Irish community
in the area. There is also a Baptist   
church and an Orthodox church with a   
mainly Greek congregation.There is also
a synagogue in North Kensington for    
those of the Jewish faith.Although     
there are many Moslems and Hindus      
living in the area we saw no sign of   
their places of worship.
