		<title>15DARTFORD - SUBSIDENCE</title>
		<content>  In parts of Dartford there is a      
serious problem of subsidence. When a  
family tried to buy a house in Brent   
Lane they found that none of the       
Building Societies would grant them a  
mortgage because the foundations of the
house are slipping down the hill, and  
on a hot summers day you can hear the  
foundations cracking. A house built in 
1934 on Shepherds Lane had to be       
demolished and rebuilt because it had  
been built on the site of an old sand  
pit. Although the hole had been filled 
with a mixture of ash and clinker, this
was washed away when the drains of the 
house cracked. It was cheaper to       
demolish the house than to try to      
underpin the foundations. The cost was 
kept down by saving the roof tiles,bath
room and kitchen fittings and replacing
them in the new house.
