		<title>14THE HAMLET OF THIRTLEBY</title>
		<content> Thirtleby is a small village there are
 about 13 houses and 33 people. You    
 don't get much traffic going through. 
 Thirtleby is mainly a farming area,   
 there is also a lot of crops around.  
 You mainly see farm vehicles like     
 tractors and landrovers. Most people  
 in Thirtleby have pets. There are     
 very small roads . Most of the houses 
 in Thirtleby are bungalows and        
 cottages. The Grange is the biggest   
 house there.                          
 It must be very quiet living in the   
 hamlet because there are no shops or  
 common buildings and only a few street
 lights so there is not a lot to do on 
 a night especially for children.      
 But if you want the quiet life then   
 Thirtleby is an ideal place for you.
