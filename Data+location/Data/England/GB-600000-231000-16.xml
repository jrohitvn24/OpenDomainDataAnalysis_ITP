 The Estate has been in existence for  
 10 years. As the demand for apples    
 fell, Mr Sexton decided to build on   
 his land. He built factories,then they
 were hired to companies. There are 20 
 factory units and between them they   
 employ about 100 people. The manager  
 is Mr Garnet, he looks after the      
 rates and office work. He has lived   
 in Langham for 17 years and has worked
 at the Boxted Industrial Estate for 3 
 years. He needs to travel to          
 Ipswich, Colchester, Chelmsford and   
 London in connection with the Estate. 
 The units house small businesses which
 includes, a transport company, a      
 wholesale greengrocer, a micro circuit
 board manufacturer and a printers.
