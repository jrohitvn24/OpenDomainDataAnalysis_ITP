		<title>03SOUTH NORMANTON NEWS</title>
		<content> The items that follow are about news  
 in the South Normanton and Pinxton    
 area.They have been taken from local  
 news papers published between the end 
 of May 1985 and the end of June 1985. 
 1. This report concerns a closure of a
 pit workshop in Blackwell and the loss
 of jobs of disabled workers.The M.P   
 Dennis Skinner doesn't agree with the 
 shut down and sent a letter to the    
 N.C.B. director for North Derbyshire, 
 saying so.The N.C.B. replied with the 
 fact that all 240 workers involved    
 with the closure will be given jobs   
 within a reasonable distance of the   
 Blackwell area.                       
 2. On Saturday June 1st 1985 twelve   
 people took part in a sponsored three 
 legged pub-crawl to raise money for   
 sufferers of Muscular Dystrophy.They  
 managed to raise Â£100.They stopped at 
 every pub they passed.                </content>
