		<title>04SHOPPING IN FELTWELL</title>
		<content>   Feltwell village has many small     
 shops but no large ones. We have one  
 very small supermarket and six other  
 shops which sell food, mostly general 
 stores. There is a newsagent, bank    
 (Three mornings a week) Post office,  
 cycle shop, building society, estate  
 agent and two sewing shops. Several   
 other services (e.g. veterinary       
 surgeon) come into the village on a   
 part time basis.                      
   For a place this size there are few 
 shops. People said that the shops they
 would most like to see in the village 
 were a chemist and a furniture store. 
   We found that not many people       
 shopped for all their needs in the    
 village, most preferring to shop in:  
{King's Lynn }(23%) {Bury St. Edmunds }
 (16%) {Thetford, Brandon, Downham     
{Market }(13% each) Some also liked to 
 shop in {Ely, Cambridge or Norwich.   </content>
