		<title>11HOXTON MARKET IN HACKNEY</title>
		<content>                                       
  Hoxton is a very busy place          
especially on Saturdays. The first     
stall arrives at dawn.  As the morning 
wears on more stalls appear and the    
place is now packed with customers.    
The smell of greasy chips lingers in   
the air.  There are lots of different  
stalls selling both new and secondhand 
clothes as well as fruit and vegetable 
and antique stores.  There is often a  
busker singing outside the butcher's   
shop.                                  
  The market stall-holders and the     
customers seem happy.  Sometimes they  
sit in deck chairs for a rest after    
doing their shopping in Hoxton Gardens.
  On Sundays Hoxton is very quiet but I
prefer the hustle and bustle of market 
days.
