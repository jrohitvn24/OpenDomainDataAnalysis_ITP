		<content> This sparsely populated undulating    
 area is predominantly Grade 2         
 Agricultural land of medium loam      
 overlying Kupar Marl and sandstone on 
 the North Warwicks coalfield. The     
 settlement is of established          
 farmsteads and cottages. Farming is   
 mainly mixed, cereals grown are barley
 and wheat with potatoes and some      
 oilseed rape as break crops.          
 Farms are mainly owner occupied averag
 ing 80h.a. Traditional dairy farms    
 have expanded recently some giving    
 way to beef and sheep units. There are
 outlying deciduous woodlands, some of 
 which (viz Hore Park) are remnants of 
 the ancient forest of Arden Apart from
 agriculture residents are employed in 
 industry and commute by car to        
 Birmingham and Coventry. Others are   
 miners at Daw Mill (Se) and Baddesley 
 (N) Mines.                            </content>
