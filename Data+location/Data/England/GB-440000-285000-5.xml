		<content> With so few shops in Wolvey we asked  
 Mrs H. how she did her{SHOPPING.      
 "As I say, at one time I could get the
{MIDLAND RED}to Hinckley or Coventry   
 but since the motorway opened the     
 Midland Red does not come through     
 Wolvey now. Vanguard Coaches of       
 Bulkington run a service to Nuneaton  
 but it is not very frequent. What I do
 now is to get my husband to take me to
 the supermarket in Hinckley in the car
 and then I can get plenty of shopping 
 at one go."                           
 "There have been some tradesmen who   
 come round in vans selling groceries, 
 meat and hardware, paraffin and such  
 like, but they do not come so much    
 now. For those without{TRANSPORT}the  
 County{LIBRARY}van comes round about  
 every 3 or 4 weeks, but many people   
 use the library in Nuneaton.
