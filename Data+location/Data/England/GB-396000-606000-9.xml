		<content>      Our parents work.                
 7 fathers are in farming,one is a     
 barrister,one owns a gents clothing   
 shop in Newcastle,one works at a local
 brick works and one is a salesman.    
  One mother has a full-time job       
 working in a retired peoples home     
 as an Auxilliary Nurse. Two mothers   
 have part-time jobs,one as a Bank     
 Clerk during the Summer,              
                                       
 and the other as a Hairdresser at     
 home.                                 
    Because there are not so many      
 employed in agriculture nowadays some 
 young people have to leave the area   
 for work.                             
   Harden Quarry employs men and many  
 wagon drivers work from there, but    
 none live in this area.
