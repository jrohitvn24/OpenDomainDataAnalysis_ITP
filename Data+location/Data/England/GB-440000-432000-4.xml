		<title>04PETTY CRIME IN GARFORTH</title>
		<content> Garforth at the moment is suffering   
 from a minor epidemic of{petty crime  
{particularly{vandalism}causing        
 pointless damage to property.{Graffiti
 which is something that is written,   
 painted or sprayed where it should not
 be, is commonplace on quite a few     
 walls and ranges from pictures to bad 
 language. One of the worst recent acts
 of vandalism was the smashing of a    
 large engraved window}in{Garforth     
{Catholic Church.}This was done by a   
 brick and people say it will cost     
 Â£4000 pounds to repair. Lately there  
 has been a spate of childrens' bikes  
 being stolen, particularly those of   
 the BMX kind. There have been several 
 people{trespassing}in  school grounds.
 Some throw mud at windows or smoke and
 drink cider.{West Garforth Junior     
{School}was burnt down in 1984 a result
  of trespassers playing with matches. </content>
