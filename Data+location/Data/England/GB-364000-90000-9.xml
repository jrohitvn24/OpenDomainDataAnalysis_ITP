		<title>09Farms in our area.</title>
		<content>   The farms in our immediate area     
 breed cows, sheep and pigs and many   
 more animals. There are about three to
 four farms in Dorchester and here are 
 some of them: Poundbury farm and      
 Middle Farm. I think that Poundbury   
 farm is the largest farm as the fields
 are very large.                       
   The field nearest to the end, by    
 Poundbury estate, has a stile.There   
 are footpaths across the fields for   
 people to use.The fields nearest to   
 the farmhouse and the railway bridge  
 are not accessible to the public.     
   Poundbury farm is kept in very good 
 condition and so are the animals.     
 There is a river running through the  
 farm which looks dusty and very murky.
