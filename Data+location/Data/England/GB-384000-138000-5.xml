		<title>05St.Michael:The Deverills</title>
		<content> The{Church of St Michael}at{Brixton   
{Deverill}was built in the 13th        
 century, though a church  has stood on
 this site since the 9th century. There
 is a strong local tradition that{King 
{Alfred}prayed here before his decisive
 battle with the Danes at Ethandune in 
 878 AD. It is a beautiful, simple     
 church and unusual, because we can see
 it almost as it was when it was built.
 It was restored in the 19th century   
 and the tower is again being repaired.
 The parishioners of the Deverill      
 Valley have raised Â£13,000 in a year  
 for this work .The tower has a  fine  
 medieval bell which was cast in       
 Salisbury in 1400.There is a Norman   
 Font from the church at Imber, given  
 in 1951 when the village was finally  
 abandoned to the Army.A church has    
 stood here for 1100 years,and still   
 worship here regularly.               </content>
