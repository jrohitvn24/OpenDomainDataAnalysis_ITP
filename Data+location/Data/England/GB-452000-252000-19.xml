		<title>19 The old Railway.</title>
		<content> There is a proposal which is causing a
great deal of controversy at present.It
is being suggested by the County       
Council that a section of the railway  
cutting south of the station site could
be used to tip rubbish.When full,it    
would be covered with topsoil so that  
it could be restored to agriculture.The
objections to this proposal are(1) that
the village roads cannot cope with the 
volume of traffic,especially the heavy 
lorries which would be involved; (2) it
would be an eyesore and would cause    
unpleasant smells and (3) the cutting  
has become a wonderful site for wild   
flowers (including rare orchids) as    
well as butterflies and other insects. 
 Meanwhile,the railway bank to the     
north of the station site is to be     
planted with trees so that commercial  
forestry can take place.There have     
been no objections to this.            </content>
