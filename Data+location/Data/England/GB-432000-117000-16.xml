		<title>16GRAVEL PRODUCTION:TEST VLY</title>
		<content>  We visited a gravel quarry of 40_50  
 acres on Broadlands Estate near to the
 river Test.There are a few variations 
 of gravel types;there are different   
 sizes of gravel.Some gravel comes from
 granite,but the granite in this area  
 was formed from eluvial and           
 flintstones,and may have originated   
 from large rivers in the area during  
 the Ice Age.There are few substitutes 
 for gravel except fibre glass matting 
 which is used with gravel not instead 
 of it.                                
  Digging for gravel has gone on here  
 for 100 years,although the present    
 quarry was begun in 1956 and the      
 newest part in April 1984.This area of
 the estate is almost work
