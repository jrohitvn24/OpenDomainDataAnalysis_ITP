   The two farms around Hampton Lucy,  
Old Pastures Farm and Tile Barn Farm,  
have been combined into one of 250     
hectares owned by a lady living in     
Stratford-on-Avon and run by a farm    
manager.                               
                                       
   The soils are light and sandy on    
the flat ground. In the river meadows  
the soil is alluvial,and on the higher 
ground it is mainly of marl.           
                                       
   The small mixed farms have given    
way to a more specialised farming      
involving the growing of oil-seed rape 
and potatoes together with some dairy  
and sheep farming.                     
                                       
   A small woodland,Half Moon Spinney, 
is left as cover for game.
