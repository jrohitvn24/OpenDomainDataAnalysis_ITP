		<title>15SHERIFFHALES-PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Parish Church in Sheriffhales     
 belongs to the Church of England and  
 is dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin.  
 The church was considerably added to  
 in 1661 with stone taken from         
 Lilleshall Abbey. The tower has a     
 peal of 6 bells and was built around  
 1721. Inside the church the glasswork 
 is of particular interest. The main   
 churchyard and burial ground is found 
 across the road from the main church  
 and here can be found a medieval cross
 which was restored after World War 1  
 as a war memorial.
