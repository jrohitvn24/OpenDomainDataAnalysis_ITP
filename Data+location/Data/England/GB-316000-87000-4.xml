		<title>04BRANSCOMBE LACE MAKING.</title>
		<content> Branscombe lace making has been famous
 for many years. Most people started   
 lace making because it was the        
 tradition .Years ago people could not 
 afford food so they made lace to pay  
 for the food.Often sitting in the open
 doorway to use the evening light.     
 There are lots of different patterns  
 to make in lace. We were shown some   
 patterns called prickings, which are  
 pinned with special pins that do not  
 rust on to a lace cushion. The cushion
 is filled with the chaff of wheat.    
 Lace making is not very easy. The     
 special thread made of cotton was     
 bought in skeins. It was then wound on
 to lace bobbins before use. Lace also 
 made locally at Beer and Honiton but  
 each lace has its own special         
 characteristics.
