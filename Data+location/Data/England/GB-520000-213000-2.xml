		<title>02BROCKET HALL - PART 1</title>
		<content> In 1746 the Brocket Estate was        
 purchased by Matthew Lamb. A new brick
 mansion was built to the design of an 
 architect called James Paine, and in  
 1781 the owner was created Viscount   
 Melbourne, MP.  One story is that he  
 attended Parliament for forty years   
 without ever making a speech!  Lord   
 and Lady Melbourne had six children,  
 of whom the second son, William, born 
 in 1779, was reputedly his mother's   
 favourite and later inherited both the
 estate and the title of Lord          
 Melbourne.  His early education, it is
 said, began in the village school but 
 later attended Eton and Cambridge     
 University.  In 1806 he was           
 elected to the House of Commons       
 becoming first Home Secretary and then
 in 1834 Prime Minister of the United  
 Kingdom at the age of fifty-five.
