		<content>   Almost the  entire industry  in this
 block  is  associated  with   farming,
 although  apart  from  their   owner/ 
 occupying family members,  only a few 
 jobs are  now provided by these farms 
 for the local population.             
   Each of the three hamlets has a high
 proportion  of   retired  people,  but
 fortunately  almost all the houses are
 occupied  all the year round  and have
 so  far  escaped  the  scourge of  the
 'holiday home fraternity'. There are a
 few  small  family  businesses   which
 include a  market garden; two kennels/
 catteries  ( one with livery stables )
 but these only provide  employment for
 their owners. The other residents     
 commute to the towns in the area which
 include Barnard Castle and Darlington.
   The population  is small,  scattered
 and largely  middle-aged  but there is
 little or no unemployment.            </content>
