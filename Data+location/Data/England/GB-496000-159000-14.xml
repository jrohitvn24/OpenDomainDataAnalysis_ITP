		<title>14Horsell Common.</title>
		<content>      Horsell Common is very popular   
 with walkers and horseriders. It is   
 very large and peaceful. It is also   
 quite sheltered because of all the    
 various trees. Horsell Common was also
 the place where{H.G.Wells}situated his
 science fiction novel,{'War Of The    
{Worlds'}written in 1898.              
      Right in the middle of Horsell   
 Common you will find Shaws Farm. The  
 owners of this farm are mainly        
 interested in poultry and so that is  
 what they keep. To the North of the   
 common is Brooklands Farm, is         
 surrounded by thirty acres            
 of land. There is also Gold Bridge    
 Farm which is in Philpot Lane. This   
 farm has thirteen acres of land and is
 mainly used for livery stock, some of 
 these stables are rented out.
