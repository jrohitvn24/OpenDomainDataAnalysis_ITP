		<content>   Freiston has stayed very much as an 
 old village with only some council    
 houses being built in recent years, as
 it is in a green belt.                
   Butterwick and Fishtoft have changed
 quite a lot with a great deal of      
 private housing having been built in  
 recent years. People have tended to   
 move out of Boston to these  houses.  
   In Fishtoft many of the new roads   
 have interesting names. Scotia Road   
 commemorates the now disappeared      
 Scotia Creek where the original       
 Pilgrim Fathers were arrested in 1607.
 Marshall Close commemorated a former  
 Chairman of the Parish Council and    
 school Goveror, whilst Rimington Road 
 commemorates Mr. Rimington who was    
 Headmaster of the school for 20 years 
 and his daughter who was Head for 30  
 years.
