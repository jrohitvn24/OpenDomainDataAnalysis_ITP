		<title>03        Footpaths</title>
		<content> Our survey showed that many footpaths 
 had no{finger posts.}They were        
 difficult to find and walk.Some       
 footpaths have been ploughed over but 
 most farmers were willing to help us  
 find new or original routes.We saw    
 many wild flowers,birds and also      
 evidence of rabbits.The main crops are
 different types of corn,beans,peas    
 and some sugar beet. Footpaths        
 also ran alongside woodland and       
 meadowland.Our area is rural and has  
 poor public transport so many people  
 own cars.We have deduced that there is
{little regular use}of many of the     
 footpaths so they have become         
 overgrown or ploughed up and difficult
 to follow. However we feel they are   
{well worth preserving}as walking      
 footpaths provides a wonderful way of 
 viewing the countryside. We all       
 enjoyed our walking immensely.        </content>
