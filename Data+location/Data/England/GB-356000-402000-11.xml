		<title>11Sparetime Activities  Wigan</title>
		<content>Children in Base 8 asked their parents,
relations and friends what they did in 
their spare time. We found the most    
popular activity was running. Others   
such as keep-fit, yoga, reading, cook- 
ing and bowling were also popular. Most
men like football and snooker, women   
like knitting. Some of the unusual hob-
bies are pigeon training and breeding, 
banjo playing, greyhound racing and    
making trailers for boats.  Altogether 
41 varied activities were listed. We   
also asked if they belonged to any     
clubs or organisations. Some families  
belong to Working Men's or Social Clubs
and some mothers belong to the Mother's
Union. Children's organisations were   
Brownies, Swimming Clubs, Comet Youth  
Club, Boys Brigade, Girls Brigade, Judo
Clubs and a Morris Dancing Troup.
