		<content> SAINT NICHOLAS CHURCH BRAMCOTE        
 The church can accommodate 700 people.
 It was dedicated in November 1968. The
 name St. Nicholas was retainedd from  
 the time when the Admiralty were at   
 Bramcote. St Nicholas    is the patron
 saint if seamen. One of the stained   
 glass windows holds a picture of St.  
 Barbara,the patron saint of artillery 
 men.There are close links with the    
 Diocese of Coventry in the churh. The 
 font is made of carved stonework from 
 the old bombed cathedal. The Coventry 
 Cross of Nails and "Father Forgive"   
 are incorporated in the design. The   
 organ has a unique history, having    
 done over a hundred years service in  
 the Bermuda Naval Dockyard Chapel,    
 West Indies. The church is octagonal  
 (eight sided) in  shape.Services are  
 held on Sundays and Thursdays.
