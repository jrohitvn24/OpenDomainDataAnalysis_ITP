		<content> The allotments near Longworth road and
 Beaumont Ave. were started by 12 men  
 who used to rent other land on the    
 other side of Horwich.When the        
 landlord evicted them because he      
 needed the land for building purposes,
 they all got together and pooled their
 money to buy one and a quarter acres  
 from the Bleachers Association who    
 owned the land near Longworth Rd.     
 The land cost 100 pounds and the men  
 divided it into allotments for        
 themselves and to rent to other people
 im Horwich.These allotments are in    
 great demand today and provide a      
 source of great pleasure for the      
 people who rent and cultivate them.
