		<title>17THE GREEN BELT AREA</title>
		<content> The{green belt }area is{land}which    
 is{protected}from being{built}on in   
 order to{preserve}the{countryside.    
{There is}a{Green Belt}area  near      
{Woodnook}extending to{Cutthorpe.}The  
 builders of the{new houses}want the   
 present{Green Belt boundary}moved so  
 that they can build more houses up to 
{Woodnook Lane.}Most people in the area
 think that any new houses would{spoil 
{the surrounding}countryside which is  
 pleasant &amp; rich in{wildlife.}The lane 
 &amp; wood area is used for{walking and   
{other recreations.}A{public enquiry   
 about the movement of the{Green belt  
{was}held in the{Town Hall}in{March    
{1985.}The{local residents}sent{letters
{objecting}to the{plans}and attended   
 the enquiry. A decision has now been  
 made by the boundary commission and   
 the{green belt}is expected to follow  
 the same line in the near future.     </content>
