		<content> THE PONIES                            
 On the moor too are hundreds of Exmoor
 ponies and a grim fight is being made 
 by the farmers to maintain the pure   
 Exmoor strain. The whitish colouring  
 around the muzzle and its wide chest  
 make it immediately identifiable from 
 all other ponies in the world. They   
 average about 12 hands or so in height
 and are fine sturdy animals. They can 
 often be seen wild on the moor and are
 rounded up prior to the Bampton Pony  
 Fair held on the last Thursday in     
 Ocober.                               
 TROUT                                 
 Trout abound in the streems and there 
 are also salmon.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
