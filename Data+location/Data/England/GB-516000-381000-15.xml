		<title>15FARMING, EAST BARKWITH</title>
		<content>    This block is predominantly        
 agricultual, and mainly arable        
 agriculture. Apart from the one farm  
 specialising in dairy farming, pasture
 is almost entirely concentrated in    
 small closes around and between the   
 dwellings in {East Barkwith}and{South 
{Willingham.}This unimproved grassland 
 is cut for hay, or is used for grazing
 one or two cows, riding ponies, or a  
 few sheep or goats. One farmer in{    
{South Willingham}keeps a small herd of
 Lincoln Red cattle in such paddocks.  
    In contrast, the arable fields are 
 usually large, having been formed from
 several smaller fields, from which the
 hedges have been removed, allowing the
 use of larger tractors,ploughs,       
 combine harvesters and other machinery
 which enable the farmers to work the  
 land intensively, and economically.
