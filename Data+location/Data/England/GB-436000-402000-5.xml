 THREE FARMS AND THERE SEEMED TO BE AN 
 EQUAL NUMBER OF FIELDS OF ARABLE AND  
 GRASS. THERE WAS ALSO A LOT OF ROUGH  
 AND WASTE LAND. WE INTERVIEWED THE    
 FARMER AT LOW LAITHES FARM AND HE TOLD
 US HIS FARM WAS JUST OVER 4OO ACRES IN
 SIZE BUT THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY FARMING 
 75O ACRES WITH LAND IN OTHER AREAS. IT
 IS MAINLY A MILK PRODUCING FARM FROM  
 2OO COWS WHICH WERE MILKED TWICE A DAY
 AND PRODUCING OVER 6OO GALLONS DAILY. 
 HE HAD 3 COWMEN AND 3 TRACTOR DRIVERS.
 28O ACRES WAS GRASS AND 12O ACRES WAS 
 USED TO GROW CORN FOR CATTLE FEED. HE 
 HAD 5 TRACTORS, A COMBINE HARVESTER   
 AND ALL THE OTHER IMPLEMENTS SUCH AS  
 PLOUGHS, CULTIVATORS, HARROWS AND     
 DRILLS. HE ALSO KEPT 35OO BATTERY HENS
 WHICH PRODUCED 12O-13O DOZ. EGGS A DAY
