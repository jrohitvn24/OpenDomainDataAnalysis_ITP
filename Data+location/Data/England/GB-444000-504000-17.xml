		<title>17Birds and Birdwatching</title>
		<content> In class 4 nearly everyone loves      
 birds. I am very keen. Alison and I   
 are always asking to watch birds at   
 playtime from our classroom window, it
 over looks our wild garden area. This 
 year we have kept good records and    
 seen some very interesting and unusual
 ones. A Cuckoo,a Bearded Tit,a        
 Bullfinch, many Fieldfares, Redwings, 
 and a Jenny Wren.                     
 Birds that are common to our school   
 grounds all the year round are - Tree 
 Sparrow, Robin, Pigeon, Barnaby       
 Dove, Pied Wagtail, House Sparrow,    
 Great Tit,  Chaffinch, Blue           
 Tit (regularly nests), GreenFinch,    
 Starling, Magpie, Rook, Blackbird,    
 Crow, and Yellow Hammer.              
 We feed the birds during the winter   
 and have noticed we now have many     
 varieties due to our pond and garden.
