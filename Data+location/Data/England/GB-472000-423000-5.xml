		<content>   The{cemetaries}in Goole provide a   
 useful key to the relatively short    
 history of the town. Many of the      
 headstones record titles of Master    
 Mariner, Captain or Shipbuilder - all 
 clues to the town's strong connections
 with the{sea.} This is further borne{ 
 out by the casualties of the second   
 world war who died at sea or who were 
 in the navy.                          
   One monument details how the        
 undefended town suffered in a{Zeppelin
 raid in the first world war.          
   It is noticeable how many child     
 deaths were occuring at the turn of   
 the century - as many as six in a     
 family.                               
   In the grave yard of the parish     
 church at Hook lay mass graves for    
 victims of{cholera}epedemics which    
 broke out in the 19th. century.
