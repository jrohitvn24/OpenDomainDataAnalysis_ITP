		<content> Villages covered-Plumtree, Tollerton  
 and Clipston on the Wolds.            
 These villages are situated approx. 6 
 miles south of Nottingham. They are   
 mainly dormitory villages although    
 there are many working farms in the   
 area. The majority of the inhabitants 
 work in Nottingham. There is, however,
 a strong feeling of community identity
 and security within the villages.     
 The surrounding countryside is        
 green-belt and predominantly used for 
 agriculture. Physically, the land is  
 gently undulating and well drained.   
 The most prominent geographical       
 features are several knolls topped    
 with stands of deciduous trees. The   
 highest point in this block is Hoe    
 Hill (86m above sea level).Both       
 Plumtree and Tollerton were pre_Norman
 settlements.
