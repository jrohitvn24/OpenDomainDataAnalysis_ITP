		<title>04MICKLEY SCHOOL FAIR</title>
		<content> At the Summer Fair we had lots of     
 games and stalls. You could win a lot 
 of things and buy cakes, books and    
 toys. There was a Tombola but I did   
 not win a prize because I did not have
 a nought or five at the end of my     
 ticket number. There was Fishing for  
 Pop, a Brantub and a Hide and Seek    
 game.  In a game Shower the Flower you
 had to throw a wet sponge at someone's
 face. This was great fun.             
 In the Super Raffle the first prize   
 was a food voucher.                   
 Certificates and prizes were presented
 to winners in the painting competition
 organised by the school for the church
 gymkhana.                             
 I really enjoyed the fair. The money  
 raised helps the school to buy extra  
 things.
