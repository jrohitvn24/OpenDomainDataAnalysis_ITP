		<content> FARMING AROUND PROBUS contd.          
 The other 2 examples are both dairy   
 farms,one of 240 &amp; the other of 400   
 acres.The smaller one has a herd of   
 about 120 Fresian cows producing about
 2,500 litres a day.The larger farm has
 2 herds of about 140 cows in each.    
 Neither farm has been greatly affected
 by the new milk quotas partly because 
 they can reduce the yield by reducing 
 the special concentrates previously   
 given.The milk is collected every day 
 by tankers from the St. Ivel Dairy in 
 Camborne.Both farms grow corn &amp; grass 
 for silage,which has replaced hay as  
 being less reliant on the weather.The 
 smaller farm has 2 working owners &amp;   
 employ 2 men &amp; the larger one is owned
 by a company &amp; employ 5 men.
