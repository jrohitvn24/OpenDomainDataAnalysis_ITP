		<content>    Towcester roads are very busy as   
 there is a major crossroads in the    
 centre. This is where the{A5}crosses  
 the{A43.}                             
    The{A5}goes to{Milton Keynes}and   
{Daventry}and the{A43}goes to          
{Northampton}and{Oxford.}Towcester is  
 fast becoming a commuter town for     
 Milton Keynes, which explains why a   
 lot of the traffic is going that way. 
    The A45 is the only main road from 
 the Northampton area that goes South, 
 which means that traffic tends to     
 build up on this road especially at   
 sunny weekends and during the summer  
 months.                               
    To add to the congestion that      
 occurs, these roads are also used for 
 all the traffic on route to the       
{Silverstone}or{Towcester races.
