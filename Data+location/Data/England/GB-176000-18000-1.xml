		<title>01COVERACK VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village of{Coverack}is situated on
 the eastern side of the{Lizard        
{Peninsula}in West Cornwall, eleven    
 miles from{Helston,}its nearest town. 
 It is a village of contrasting houses,
 some of which are more than four-     
 hundred years old, others of very     
 recent construction. It has developed 
 around a small eastward facing bay, to
 the south of which is a{picturesque   
{harbour.}The older part of the        
 village, around the harbour area, is  
 characterised by a number of houses   
 which retain much of their{old-world  
{charm,}with whitewashed walls and     
 thatched roofs. Some of these houses  
 still bear evidence of the past, with 
{remains of hidden cupboards and rooms 
{used by smugglers}in days long gone.  
 The occupants of these houses still   
 lovingly retain the original exterior 
 appearance of their homes.            </content>
