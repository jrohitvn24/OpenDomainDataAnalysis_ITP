		<title>11FARMING</title>
		<content>{There}are all sorts of farms nowadays 
 but most farm land.The most farm      
 knowledge that I have is of a farm in 
 Poltimore. They farm animals but they 
 used to farm land as well but they    
 used to get the ear but nothing was   
 in it. So they decided to stop and    
 grow grass for the animals to eat.Some
 farmers can grow cereals. There are   
 12 farms in {BROADCLYST AND POLITOMORE
{        INTERVIEW WITH A FARMER       
 The first thing I do in the morning is
 milk the cows ,it is the last thing   
 too.The machinery I own is 3 Massy    
 tractors and other machinery. I own 10
 acres and 4 people work for me. I     
 farm animals and I work from 6.30am to
 9.00pm.I would not swop for another   
 job because I live here.
