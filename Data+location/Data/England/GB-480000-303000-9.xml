		<content> 50 acres of grassland to the north of 
 Priors Coppice(833055) has been used  
 as a stud, breeding horses for flat   
 racing, National Hunt racing and      
 riding horses. A range of 10 loose    
 boxes and hay barn(836057) were used  
 for the mares and foals. The land and 
 buildings are presently for sale as   
 the owner considers that the economic 
 situation has made horse breeding an  
 unviable proposition. He estimates the
 cost of producing a foal to be Â£1000  
 per year making a four year old worth 
 Â£4000, a price no one is prepared to  
 pay. As well as horses the grassland  
 is grazed by sheep and bullocks in    
 order to keep it in good condition and
 reduce the problem of internal        
 parasites.
