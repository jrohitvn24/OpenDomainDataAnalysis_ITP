      You see, the problem is there is 
 nothing there! One{power station,}one 
{sewage works}and a bit of{fishing     
 recreation and that's it.             
 Nevertheless, an interesting area,    
 even though we got nettled and covered
 in wet coal sludge.                   
      A fascinating area: high-powered 
 (sic) industry &amp; modern technology    
 alongside the examples of dereliction 
 and disuse and, overlooking all, one  
 of the products of the seventeenth    
 century:{Temple Newsam House.         
      We actually walked right through 
 the area to{Pontefract Road.}We a     
 little of one of the squares, but from
 talking to the CEGB man on the dump it
 would seem to be one vast{open-cast   
{mine.}We logged it as a colliery. It  
 is known as the Ox-bow site.
