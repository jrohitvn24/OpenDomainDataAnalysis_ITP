		<title>08A WALK AROUND NAUNTON FARM</title>
		<content>  The land to the Naunton Farm side of 
 the B4078 particularly those coming   
 down to the road contained crops of   
 ripening wheat. Two smaller fields    
 contained broad beans. Cows were      
 grazing on the meadows around the farm
 itself. New poplar trees had been     
 planted on the S.E. side of the lane  
 running up to the farm. The farm has  
 two, new barns of metal construction. 
  There are several areas of           
 uncultivated woodland which no doubt  
 supported wildlife other than the     
 birds and rabbits which were seen.    
  On the opposite side of the road from
 the farmthere is a sawmill which had  
 new buildings and an air of           
 prosperity. However, in contrast the  
 area round the filling station looked 
 very untidy and run down. A new       
 gaspipe was being laid making an ugly 
 gash right across the landscape.      </content>
