		<title>15LIVING STANDARDS</title>
		<content> In general, the standard of living of 
 the people is quite high.  Many       
 families have a car.  Of the house_   
 holds who do not, all are elderly     
 couples or old ladies living alone.   
 .the car gives us the freedom to seek 
 our interests elsewhere, and for this 
 reason village social life is much    
 curtailed compared with, say, thirty  
 years ago. Almost every household has 
 a television set and a radio. There   
 is a cinema in Hastings, and also     
 occasional concerts and shows, but    
 most people go to these only rarely.  
 Many people take an annual vacation,  
 possibly abroad. The main disadvant_  
 aged group are the very elderly living
 alon and probably without their own   
 transport. The road is dangerous for  
 walking so frail people can easily    
 become housebound.  For the rest of us
 walking in the countryside is a joy.  </content>
