		<title>13 Subsidence Around Blackwood</title>
		<content>All the farms in the Blkwood area are  
under the threat of subsidence. The    
solidly built Blackwood House Farm is  
not in too much danger but the barn    
collapse. The builbings at Blackwood   
Pig Farm, not built on rafts, could be 
the first to fall down. As these       
buildings were built before the        
Whitemoor Mine, the owners can claim   
compensation. It would be cheaper for  
the N.C.B. to pay the farmers to knock 
down the buildings and build new ones, 
than to pay for alterations. Already   
the drive of Blackwood Pig Farm has had
to be re-surfaced due to cracks and    
different levels of tarmac. All the    
houses are built on rafts, so that if  
our next-door-neighbour's house sinks, 
we'll either sink too or be higher up  
as the houses are semi-detached.
