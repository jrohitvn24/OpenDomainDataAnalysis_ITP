		<content>      We went to see some{Quantock     
{Ponies.}The four ponies were in a     
 field, two mothers and two foals. We  
 went in the field. One of the foals   
 was quite ugly as he was just changing
 colour but the other one was a light  
 brown colour.                         
     One of the ponies was a{Quantock  
{pony}the other one was a pure{Exmoor. 
 None of the ponies are{shod or        
{stabled}in winter. When on the        
 hills the ponies mostly feed          
 themselves. They used to have four    
 foals here but one died and one got   
 killed.                               
    They do not have a spcial call when
 they round them up. They are always   
 sold in September. Most of them are   
 broken in when they are three to four 
 years old. Quantock ponies all have a 
 good build and are strong.
