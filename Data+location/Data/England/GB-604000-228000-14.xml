		<title>14My day and favourite game</title>
		<content> I got up and got dressed.  I had      
 Weetabix for my breakfast.  I dressed 
 Linsey my doll. Then my Mum took      
 Shelley and me down to her friend's   
 because she was going to work.        
 At dinner time Shelley and I went to  
 get some chips. When we had our dinner
 I took Kerry over to the play area.   
 We were there about half an hour.Then 
 I took her home. We had beans,        
 sausages and mash for tea.  We watched
 Hi de Hi on the television and went to
 bed at nine o'clock..Beverley Saunders
