		<title>09LEEDSTOWN CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content> Leedstown Cricket Club was founded in 
 1873 and after moving fields adjacent 
 to the village (at one time the area  
 where Milbank Meadow is now,was the   
 village cricket field) moved to its   
 present field in 1929.                
 Originally a much smaller building    
 served as a pavilion and was sited    
 immediately to the left of the gate.  
 However in 1931 the Lady Gwen mine    
 closed down and the present pavilion  
 was purchased from the mining company 
 for the sum of Â£150.This sum included 
 transportation.                       
 Over the years Leedstown C.C.has      
 produced a playing surface that is the
 envy of many clubs and always         
 appreciated by visiting teams.The club
 fields sides that play in Senior      
 Division 2 (west) and Junior Division 
 3 (west) as well as the Mining        
 Division Evening League.              </content>
