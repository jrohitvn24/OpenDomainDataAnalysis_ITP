		<content> Most Consett farms, situated in the   
 Derwnt Valley, are{cattle and sheep   
 farms. Few dairy herds exist as       
 European surpluses required milk to be
 cut, so cattle are raised for beef.   
     Grass is sown for stock feeding.  
     Rough land is grazed.             
     In some fields, grass is grown six
 weeks, cut, "wilted" and compressed in
 black plastic bags. This silage is    
 stored for winter use as "sweet       
 fodder".                              
     Artificial and natural fertilizers
 are spread to encourage a second crop 
 of grass for hay. The hay is machine  
 cut, turned, baled and stored for     
 winter feed.                          
     Few 'green' crops are sown        
 although one or two fields of potatoes
 have been planted.Occasional patches  
 of yellow rape can be seen, grown for 
 it's seed which produces oil.         </content>
