		<content> LIKE MANY SCHOOLS IN SMALL VILLAGES,  
 ACLE PRIMARY IS ONE OF THE FOCAL      
 POINTS OF THE COMMUNITY.ALTHOUGH THE  
 PRESENT PREMISES ARE SOMEWHAT CRAMPED 
 AND OLD (IN PARTS OVER 3OO YEARS OLD!)
 THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE SCHOOL IS       
 FRIENDLY AND WELCOMING AND THERE IS A 
 FLOURISHING PARENT TEACHER ASSOCIATION
   DESPITE THE ANCIENT BUILDINGS AND   
 MOBILE CLASSROOMS,THE PRIMARY SCHOOL'S
 CURRICULUM IS A BLEND OF THE BEST OF  
 TRADITIONAL AND MODERN  APPROACHES -  
 THERE IS A COMPUTER IN EVERY ROOM,    
 INCLUDING THE INFANT RECEPTION CLASS. 
 DURING THE SUMMER OF 1985 RUMBLINGS   
 FROM THE EDUCATION OFFICE SUGGESTED   
 THAT BUILDING OF NEW PREMISES MIGHT   
 START FAIRLY SOON.SHOULD THIS BE THE  
 CASE, IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE      
 CHANGE OF SITE WILL NOT AFFECT THE    
 PRESENT EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
 STAFF,PUPILS AND COMMUNITY.           </content>
