		<title>08THE CARAVAN PARK</title>
		<content> The caravan park covering 24 acres is 
 near Dobbs Weir, Hoddesdon. The park  
 is on an island, with the River       
 Lea on one side and the River Lynch on
 the other. It has been open since 1950
 and is owned by Lea Valley Regional   
 Authority. The caravan park is open   
 from Easter to October, with August   
 the most popular month. The park will 
 hold 100 static caravans and 100      
 touring caravans. Tents are also      
 allowed. There are 6 metres of space  
 between each caravan. The caravan park
 has toilets, showers, a laundry and   
 special facilities for the disabled.  
 Touring caravans pay Â£1.80 per person 
 per night. Static caravans pay Â£360   
 per year. Mr. Bland is the manager. He
 has to manage the park, see it is kept
 clean and arrange to have the grass   
 cut. He has an assistant in summer. It
 is a very pleasant site.              </content>
