 Modern{HOUSING}:In the 1960s ten      
 houses were built round a close to    
 form Madgeways Close. In the early    
 seventies Orchard House was built in  
 the orchard of Great Amwell House to  
 the most advanced architectural       
 standards of the time.                
{ATTITUDES}:The sense of History in Gt.
 Amwell is very great, with a strong   
 feeling among the villagers, as shown 
 by the{conservation}of houses and old 
 trees (listing). This is not perhaps  
 surprising when one looks at the      
 beautiful architecture, gardens &amp;     
 landscapes.
