		<content>{A day in the life of a caretaker.}    
 The main jobs of the day are to see to
 the boilers and fill the bunkers with 
 coal. The hardest job is stoking the  
 coal boilers. There are three boilers.
 One is for hot water.{                
{                                      
{This week Mr Bramley is on a split    
{shift. He comes in at 7.00am until    
{9.00am then he comes back at 12.15pm  
{until 6.00pm.}                        
                                       
 He cleans the entrance, the infants'  
 hall and then the infants' toilets.   
 After that he cleans the playground.  
{There are two caretakers and five lady
{cleaners, they come in at 3.30pm.}    
                                       
 Our caretaker doesn't like cleanig the
 drain pipes when the Headmaster tells 
 him to. Sometimes he does odd jobs for
 the teachers.                         </content>
