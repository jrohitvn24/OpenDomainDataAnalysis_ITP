		<content>    Shalford Common is situated to the 
 south of Shalford village.It contains 
 several leisure facilities, including 
 a cricket wicket and football pitch.  
 Shalford pond is used for fishing and 
 is famous for the frog and toad       
 crossing in the Spring.Shalford Common
 is lined by terraced,semi-detached and
 detached houses.                      
    Next to the common lies the busy   
 Shalford/Horsham road and a           
 mini-roundabout where many accidents  
 have occurred.This is the reason why  
 they are enlarging it at the presant  
 time.
