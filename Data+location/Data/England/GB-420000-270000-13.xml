{The school hall,}dining-room,common   
 rooms and bedrooms are in the old     
 house,while the classrooms are in the 
 stable block and outbuildings. One    
 classroom used to be a coachhouse, and
 another is still sometimes referred to
 as 'the onion shed'.                  
                                       
{The pupils}have changed a lot in      
 recent years. They are happier than   
 they used to be, and the atmosphere is
 not so strict. They used to have to   
 wear hats in winter and boaters in    
 summer.It is easier in general now for
 a child than it used to be.           
{                                      
{The School is quite isolated,}and it  
 is a shame that the main A41 is at the
 end of the drive,as this means that   
 the girls cannot go out for walks as  
 they used to,because of the traffic.  </content>
