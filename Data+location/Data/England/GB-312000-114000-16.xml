		<content> Portculis groove remains at Hemyock   
 Castle show us a modern technology of 
 800 years ago,but still used today.   
 This groove tells of a large gate,    
 chain,a windlass and perhaps gears    
 man-powered from the adjacent towers. 
 The home beyond contains 1980s        
 technology.For example a heat pump    
 heats domestic hot water. This not    
 well-understood device hangs in the   
 roof space and pumps heat into water. 
 During day or night, sunshine or rain 
 it continues to operate.Its virtue    
 lies in the fact that for energy 1Kw  
 consumed, 3 Kw is actually put into   
 the water.In other words water can be 
 heated over 24 hours at cheap rate    
 fuel prices.The wonder lies in the    
 simple process of the refrigerator    
 being used in reverse. The loft air is
 cooled and the heat gained is pumped  
 into the hot water system.            </content>
