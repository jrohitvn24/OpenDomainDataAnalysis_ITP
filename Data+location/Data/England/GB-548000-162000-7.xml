		<title>07The Chelsfield Summer Fete</title>
		<content> On Saturday 22nd of June the Summer   
Fete was being held in th parish       
garden.There were many stores such as  
"Spin for a Coke,Raffle,Lucky Dip,Soak 
the Teacher,Smash the China,Peg Game"  
and many more. My mum was on the "Spin 
For A Coke Stall".                     
 The Fete started at 2.00pm and lasted 
until  5.30pm.At 2.30pm everyone       
stopped and Chelsfield School did an   
exhibition of country dancing,it was a 
bit tricky because it had been raining 
all the morning and the grass was      
rather slippy.After this was the Fancy 
Dress competition won by Christy who   
was dressed as a tube of               
Smarties.Whilst all this was going on a
dog show was also taking place.        
 I had a go at "Soak the Teacher" and  
threw 3 sponges at my teacher          
Mr.Eshelby.After I had been on most of 
the stalls Iwent home with my mum.     </content>
