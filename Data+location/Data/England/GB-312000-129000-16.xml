		<title>16THE FRIENDSHIP INN (CONT)</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 We asked the landlord of the inn if we
 could interview him.                  
                                       
 How did he inn get its name?          
                                       
 No one seems to know. It could have   
 been a  friendly place to stop;       
 perhaps travellers always got a       
 welcome here. I like to think so.zor  
 it could have something to do with a  
 Society of Friends. Another           
 possibility is that it was a pub where
 the members of a Friendly Society used
 to meet.                              
                                       
 How has the inn changed since you've  
 been here?                            
                                       
 We've had the place done up.
