		<title>16CATTLE FARMING</title>
		<content> Local cattle husbandry is largely     
 applied to the production of beef,    
 with the most popular breeds coming   
 from Fresian X Hereford, Fresian X    
 Charolais or Fresian X Aberdeen Angus.
 Recently however we have seen an      
 increase in the number of pure bred   
 Charolais and the introduction of the 
 Limousan.                             
                                       
 The small number of dairy units within
 the area seem to favour the Fresian   
 strains.  Milking is carried out twice
 daily with the milk being farm stored 
 in refrigerated stainless steel bulk  
 tanks, ready for daily collection by  
 Milk Marketing Board road tankers and 
 subsequent delivery to either the     
 dairy for bottling, or to the creamery
 for conversion into butter and cheese.
