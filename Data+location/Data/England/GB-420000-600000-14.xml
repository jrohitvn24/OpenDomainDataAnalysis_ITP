		<title>14Acklington Village Hall</title>
		<content>{Acklington Village Hall}was built in  
 1925 at the second attempt (a gale    
 blew most of it down while it was     
 under construction). It is a red      
 bricked building, not very glamorous  
 but with{good amenities}(kitchen,     
 toilets, hall, meeting room, stage,   
 storage rooms, small car park etc.)   
 and is well used by villagers.{Clubs  
 that use it regularly are: Badminton  
 Club, Carpet Bowls Club, Autumn Club  
 (Senior Citizens) and the Women's     
 Institute. It is also frequently used 
 by the{church}for functions such as   
 Coffee Mornings, Suppers, P.C.C.      
 meetings and occasional Dances and    
 Concerts. It is also used for parties,
 elections and village celebrations.   
 The{charges}are very low, ranging from
 Â£1 to Â£5 (depending on what is used   
 and for how long), which is one reason
 why the hall is in use most nights.   </content>
