<title>20Bypass was a good thing</title>
<content>

In the 1980s people were very wary of the new bypass, but it has been a godsend. As traffic has increased beyond what anyone could have envisaged, people living all along the route, from Kings Langley, all the way to Aston Clinton, have had thousands of cars and lorries taken away from their doorsteps. It was a shame to split part of Box Moor, in Hemel, but the space is still there - only a tiny bit was used for the road in the end. The land is used for grazing animals, many of them rare breeds. Hemel would be more gridlocked than it is now if it were not for the A41 bypass. Not everything new is a bad thing!   &lt;br />
