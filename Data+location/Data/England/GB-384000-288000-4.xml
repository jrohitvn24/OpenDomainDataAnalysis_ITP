		<title>04The Wells in Swindon</title>
		<content>Swindon was originally part of the     
Royal Forest of Kinver. Wild pigs were 
bred for hunting, hence the name       
{Swin}don. Later the land passed into  
the ownership of the Earl of Dudley and
was divided into farms. Each farm had  
its own well. Most of these had a      
hand-pump which pumped water into a    
stone trough.                          
The village well is over 200 years old.
It is in the Holloway opposite the     
Green Man Pub. Unlike the farm wells   
it did not draw water from under the   
ground but was fed by a spring which   
ran into the back. This is like the    
Derbyshire wells. It stopped being     
used in 1905, not 1902 which the sign  
next to it says. Piped water had to be 
brought into the village because the   
wells were becoming contaminated       
because of the works and were running  
dry.                                   </content>
