		<title>18Morris Dancing</title>
		<content> Morris dancing at Winster was first   
 documented in 1908,however it had been
 in existence long before this. During 
 the First World War the dancing lapsed
 but the group reformed by the early   
 1920's.                               
 The Winster Morris Dancers were very  
 active during the inter-war period and
 they performed at garden fetes in     
 Winster and throughout the county.The 
 Second World War nearly finished the  
 Winster Morris Men,and it was not     
 until 1951 that the team was reformed.
 The Winster team comprises 16         
 dancers,a musician and 4 characters:  
 The King,the Queen,the Jester and the 
 Witch.The King dressed in military    
 uniform,leads the procession,together 
 with the Queen,(a man dressed as a    
 Victorian Lady).The Jester and Witch  
 entertain the crowd during the dances.
