   There is Denby Grange Colliery in   
 the block, the local name is the      
 " wood pit " because of its location  
 in a deep wooded valley.              
   The shaft was sunk in 1854. The pit 
 had a record coal production over a 5 
 day period ending 22nd June 1985, when
 25,000 tons were produced. This was a 
 U.K. record.                          
   The output of coal is 100% Power    
 station fuel. From the pit it is      
 transported underground (along with 9 
 other pits out of our block ) to      
 Woolley West Side Washer, therafter by
 road to the power stations.
