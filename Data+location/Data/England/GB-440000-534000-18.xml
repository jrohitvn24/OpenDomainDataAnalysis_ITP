		<title>18DAVID'S FIRST COMMUNION</title>
		<content> On Sunday morning I got dressed and   
 washed.I wore a white shirt,red tie   
 and grey trousers.I was going to our  
 church which is called Our Lady of the
 Rosary.In the church the children went
 into the hall with their candles, we  
 walked in procession round the church 
 and up to the altar. My Dad lit my    
 candle.Then we carried our gold books 
 to the altar and our family had       
 communion. Father Meagher said the    
 mass and then we went outside. We had 
 our photographs taken and then we had 
 breakfast in the hall.In the afternoon
 we had dinner with cakes, flans and   
 trifle and then we played outside.    
 After tea we played until our visitors
 went home. I watched television and   
 went to bed at about 9.30pm.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
