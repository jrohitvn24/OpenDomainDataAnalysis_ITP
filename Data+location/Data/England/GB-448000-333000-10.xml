		<title>10LONG EATON. Background.</title>
		<content>  Long Eaton, part of the Borough of   
 Erewash is located mid-way between    
 Nottingham and Derby at the southern  
 end of the River Erewash on the land  
 beside the Trent floodplain.          
  Until the mid 19th century Long Eaton
 was a small agricultural community,   
 with Sawley, to the west being more   
 important.                            
  The rapid expansion of the lace      
 industry in the late 19th century     
 caused startling growth. In 1864 there
 were 26 lace manufactureres in Long   
 Eaton, in 1912, 173. The building and 
 repair of Railway Wagons, engineering,
 furniture and other textile industries
 also grew later to give Long Eaton a  
 broad evonomic base.                  
  Long Eaton is now an important       
 service centre for the surrounding    
 villages.
