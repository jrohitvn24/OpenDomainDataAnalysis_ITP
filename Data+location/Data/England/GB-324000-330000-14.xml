		<content>   The villagers and other people in   
 our area, when asked commented about  
 how{friendly}their village was.       
   People who were comparatively new to
 the area could remember people ringing
 them up and asking them to join in    
 with the{entertainments}held.         
   Most of the people we talked to     
 seemed very glad to help us. Although 
 our area was not very highly populated
 they had much entertainment,this was  
 very popular with the villagers and   
 helped them remain close.             
   Everyone in Rhydycroesau agreed that
 the village shop was very useful.Most 
 people said that they only used the   
 village shop for vital every-day items
 and went to Oswestry most of the      
 time for large{shopping}expeditions.  
 Many houses had freezers and were     
 able to store large amounts of food   
 safely without deterioration..        </content>
