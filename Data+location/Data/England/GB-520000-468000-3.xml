		<content> Apart from the Flamborough village    
 centre shops, there are several other 
 small businesses in the area. There   
 are 3 small building firms which      
 construct houses and flats in the     
 village and surrounding district. Two 
 coal merchants do good trade as there 
 is no gas in the village. In Dog and  
 Duck Square is Boro Works, a rock     
 factory which is quaint and old       
 fashioned inside. There are three     
 motor garages on the southern side of 
 the headland. In Flamborough village  
 centre are four public houses and a   
 resteraunt. Sewerby village has only  
 two shops, a sub Post Office which    
 sells groceries and fancy goods and a 
 fried fish and chip shop. There is a  
 resteraunt and a public house.
