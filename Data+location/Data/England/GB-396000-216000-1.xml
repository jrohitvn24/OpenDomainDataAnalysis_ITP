		<content> Our area covered part of the Cotswold 
 escarpment including a section of the 
 steep scarp slope and some of the     
 rolling dip slope behind. It is rural 
 with only one small village and one   
 hamlet, together with some farms,     
 fairly substantial in acreage. On one 
 farm there was the bonus of a newly   
 opened excavation of a Roman villa.   
   The Cotswolds are limestone, which  
 is porous, a so there is not much     
 water lying on the top, only where the
 limestone has impurities. Seven       
 Springs, lying fairly high up, is     
 claimed as source of the Thames.      
 Because the farms are properous       
 woodland has been left, mainly for    
 sporting purposes and this means that 
 the landscape is varied. We observed  
 life in the communities, schools and  
 farms.
