 near the old centre of the village,   
 the shop and bakery have a staff of

 bakery, where bread is baked in an    
 oven used since 1891.A large loaf     
 costs 50p. A range of bread and cakes 
 are made.Cold meats and prepared      
 salads are the products most          
 frequently bought. The customers who  
 are mainly but not entirely           
 local residents often come for butter,
 cheese, tinned food,biscuits and wine 
 and spirits.                          
  The shop closes  Wednesday afternoons
 and Sundays. Saturday morning is the  
 busiest time.Links with the past are  
 retained despite the introduction of  
 self-service and off-licence          
 facilities.
