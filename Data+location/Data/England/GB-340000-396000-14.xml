		<title>14A morning at Kirkby C.E.</title>
		<content> My name is Jennifer. I am 7 and the   
 class I am in is J1 at Kirkby C.E. We 
 start school at 8.50 when we mark the 
 register and only 2 people were off   
 today. After that we went into        
 Assembly which was taken by the       
 Head Teacher who told us all about    
 people who help us. Following that we 
 went back to the classroom for Maths. 
 It was all about factors.             
 At 10.30 it is playtime and in the    
 Hall some children from the top class 
 sell crisps and biscuits. After play  
 we had Science and we are learning all
 about the human body. I really like   
 Science and today I found out all     
 about lungs.                          
 At noon we have lunch but             
 unfortunately the teachers are        
 working to rule so the school is      
 closed at dinner time and this means  
 we have to go out of school for dinner</content>
