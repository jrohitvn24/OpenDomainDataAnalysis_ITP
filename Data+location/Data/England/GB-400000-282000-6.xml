		<title>06Clubs - Stonehouse Gang</title>
		<content>The Stonehouse Gang was formed by Harry
Webb in 1938. He was a reporter &amp; saw  
boys getting into trouble in court so  
 e started a club. He called it        
 Stonehouse Gang after the name of our 
estate. It had a motto "It is better to
light a candle than cure the darkness".
It began in a church but moved to      
Swinford Rd &amp; used an old hen-house as 
a building. Rules were made &amp; a court  
was held to pass sentence on members   
who misbehaved. In 1965 a cottage in   
Wales was bought by a rich man as a    
gift to the gang. It is called Ty-Careg
which means Stonehouse in Welsh. This  
information was given to us by Mike    
Lee who is the present leader. I think 
the gang is great on Tuesday night. We 
play  games &amp; do disco dancing &amp; I     
have made a lot of friends &amp; been to   
Wales for a week-end. 69 children in   
our school are members of the Gang.    </content>
