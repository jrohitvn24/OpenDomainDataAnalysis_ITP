		<title>18The Stretching Machine.</title>
		<content> This machine was engineered by Smith's
 Engineers of Whitworth to a design of 
 Roe Acre's specification, 7 years ago.
 It was based on machinery used in the 
 USA and is{the only one of its kind   
{in England.  }                        
   The purpose of the machine is to    
 stabilize the cloth by taking out all 
 the inherent stretch in the yarns, and
 the cloth passes backwards and        
 forwards from one roller to the other 
 under very great controlled tension.  
 The operative has to be highly skilled
 and develop a "feel" for the fabric,  
 so that he knows how much tension to  
 apply.                                
  When the cloth is finished it is     
 despatched to a rubber coater who     
 bonds several layers of cloth with    
 rubber to make a roll of rubber coated
 cloth which is used as pads when paper
 is being printed.                     </content>
