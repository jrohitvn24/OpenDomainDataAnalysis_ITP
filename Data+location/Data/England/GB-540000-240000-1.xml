 light soils is devoted almost entirely
 to large scale cereal production.     
 From west to east the ancient Ickmeld 
 Way is now a farm road but a well used
 walk for people from far and wide.    
 Other reminders of antiquity are the  
 strip lynchets on Anthony Hill and the
 Steydon or Brand Ditch of very ancient

 lies within the allotted area, had    
 four farms each tenanted by a resident
 farmer and employing collectively some
 twenty to thirty local men.           </content>
