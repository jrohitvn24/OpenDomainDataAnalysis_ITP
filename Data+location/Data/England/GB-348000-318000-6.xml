		<title>06SHROPSHIRE HEDGEROWS.</title>
		<content>                                       
      During the survey period of June 
 and July 1985 whilst travelling round 
 the area we found the hedgerows,      
 although containing many colourful    
 plants, were a positive hazzard to    
 road users in the lanes.This was      
 because many brambles and large plants
 stuck out into the road and blocked   
 the view round the corners.           
      We understand from the people in 
 the area that in the past The Council 
 always came round to cut the hedges,  
 but they have had to save so much     
 money that hedge cutting is one of the
 thing that has suffered. Farmers would
 do it but at this time of year they   
 are so busy with the silage making    
 that they cannot spare the time.Also  
 it ties up a tractor for two or three 
 days when it could be used on the     
 farm.                                 </content>
