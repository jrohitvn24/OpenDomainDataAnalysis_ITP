		<content> A DAY IN MY LIFE                      
 This morning I got up at about        
 7:30am and got dressed,cleaned        
 my teeth and put my shoes on.         
 About 8:00am I got my swimming        
 costume ready and about 5 minutes     
 later I had a breakfast of            
 crunchy nut corn flakes and           
 after that fried bread and bacon      
 with some orange squash for my        
 drink.In my lunch for school I        
 have a penguin,an apple,sandwiches    
 and some crisps.I go to school and    
 we all went swimming.We go to Romsey  
 swimming pool and this week we had    
 our swimming gala.I went in for the   
 25metres freestyle and the 50metres   
 freestyle and also the diving         
 contest.I did not get anything in     
 the diving but in the 25m and 50m     
 I got two thirds.When we got back     
 it was playtime,and after playtime    </content>
