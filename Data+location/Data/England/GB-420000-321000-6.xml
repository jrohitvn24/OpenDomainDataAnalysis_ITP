		<title>06A BUS DRIVER IN BURTON</title>
		<content>Page 2 (of 2)                          
                                       
   The basic week is 39 hours, but the 
drivers work 52 or 53 hours a week.    
Basic pay is just over 2.26 pounds an  
hour,with a bonus of 23.19 pounds for  
one-man operation. Other bonuses bring 
pay to around 140 pounds a week.       
Mr. Ireland drives up to 10 hours in a 
shift which can be spread over 16      
hours,although the law insists on a    
rest after 5.5 hours,so his working    
day could stretch from 7 a.m to 11     
p.m. In the 10 minutes before and      
after duty the bus has to be checked.  
  After about 3 weeks training         
drivers go on the road in an ESDC      
bus,usually made by Leyland, Daimler   
or Dennis, with a maximum speed of     
40mph,using engines of around 160      
brake horse power to carry up to 78    
people about Burton.                   </content>
