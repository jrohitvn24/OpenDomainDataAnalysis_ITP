		<content>{THE ESTATES OF MARSH FARM AND SUNDON  
{PARK}The houses in the urban area of  
 Sundon Park were built mostly in the  
 1960's and 1970's. Most of the houses 
 are either terraced or semi-detached. 
 Few houses had garages next to them   
 and in narrow streets they had to park
 their cars in the drive or in the     
 road. The earliest houses were in the 
 1950's these have rounded windows. The
 three main roads in Sundon Park are   
 Grampian Way,Hill Rise and Sundon     
 Road. The other roads are fairly      
 quiet.There were twenty eight shops   
 serving the community,these included  
 a supermarket, post office, betting   
 shop,video shop and library.          
 Marsh Farm is made up of mainly       
 council houses. The buildings are     
 predominantly brick built, many of    
 them being terraced.
