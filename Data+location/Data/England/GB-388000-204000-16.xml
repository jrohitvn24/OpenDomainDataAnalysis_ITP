		<content> Eastcombe is a village of some 245    
 houses.  Until about 1960s very little
 change occurred in its character.  Now
 many new houses are being built on its
 upper slopes.  It as a small church, a
 Baptist chapel, a primary school and a
 secondary school which serves a larger
 area.  It has a pub, a shop and a     
 doctors' surgery.  The oldest part of 
 the village is on the lowest slope of 
 the hill. The earliest house,"Rodways"
 was originally a farm dating back to  
 before 1500 as it once had no chimney-
 only a hole in the roof.  In a survey 
 in 1851 the majority of the people    
 were employed in the cloth mills in   
 the Stroud valley, having in earlier  
 times been self-employed weavers      
 working in their own cottages. Then   
 many cottagers kept a pig and had     
 other jobs like having a small shop,  
 mending shoes and selling rice pudding</content>
