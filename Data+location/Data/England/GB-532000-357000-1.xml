		<title>01General view of Stickney.</title>
		<content> This area  stretches from the northern
 part of the village of Stickney, to   
 the southern boundary of the village  
 of Stickford. It contains the         
 reclaimed east and west fens and the  
 height of the land ranges from below  
 sea level to nine metres above sea    
 level.                                
 The land enclosed by the east         
 and west catchwater drains is         
 predominatly small fields used for    
 grazing, while the land beyond this   
 has been drained to create large      
 arable fields.                        
   There are no shopping facilities in 
 the area, although there are three    
 small nurseries, and a "picnic place" 
 with toilets for motorists and local  
 use.There is one garage which provides
 car servicing and fuel, and an old    
 peoples home.                         
                                       </content>
