		<title>03A CHILD'S DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   My name is Gaynor. I am a girl aged 
 11. I leave home with my sister at    
 8.35 am to go to school. We arrive    
 there at about 8.50. The whistle is   
 blown by a teacher at 8.55 and we line
 up in classes to enter school. In the 
 classroom our teacher marks the       
 register and asks who is staying at   
 school for lunch. At 9.15 we have     
{assembly.}We sing hymns and say       
 prayers. This is taken by one of the  
 teachers. At 9.45 we return to our    
 classroom and we are told what the    
 work is for that day. We have{language
 and{mathematics}each day. We also have
{science, art and project}during the   
 week. One afternoon we have{singing   
 and we have{P.E and games}twice a     
 week. We have a 15 minute break in the
 morning and a 10 minute break in the  
 afternoon. We have an hour for lunch. 
 I go home. School ends at 3.45 pm.    </content>
