		<title>17Life on the Doniford Stream</title>
		<content>      The{Doniford Stream}has played   
 an important part in the life of this 
 block.   There is still clear evidence
 of three{water mills}using the stream 
 as an{energy}source.   These are to be
 found at{Curdon, Providence and       
{Sampford Flour Mill.  }This last mill 
 was still used for the preparation of 
 animal feeds between the wars.        
      The Wildlife of the stream is    
 rich and varied.   Many people still  
 think that it maintains one pair of   
{otters.  }In fact{otterhounds}still   
 work this stretch of river - not to   
 hunt and kill the otter but to        
 identify and protect their{holt.      
 Near Sampford Brett this was to be    
 found in an old drain.   There are a  
 number of varieties of{fresh water    
{fish}which attract the{heron}and for  
 the lucky, or very observant, the     
{kingfisher.                           </content>
