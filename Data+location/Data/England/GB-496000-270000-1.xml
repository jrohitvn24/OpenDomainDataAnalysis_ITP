		<content>{Raunds}is the main town in our 3 by 4 
 kilometre rectangle.                  
  Raunds began as an isolated village  
 and is now a small industrial town.   
 It is situated in a long narrow valley
 on the eastern bank of the larger Nene
 valley.The local scenery is quite     
 delightfully rural,not having been    
 spoilt like so many places on the     
 western side of the river Nene by     
 quarrying and iron works.             
  The first historical reference to    
 Raunds is in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
 circa 980 AD where it is listed as    
{"Randa"}or{"Raunde".}During the 12th  
 century it occurs as{"Randes"}or      
{"Raundes".}The name is believed to be 
 Anglo-Saxon and means edge or edges.  
  Raunds  was  mentioned in the {      
{Domesday}book.
