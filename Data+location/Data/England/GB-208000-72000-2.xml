		<title>02Hay and Silage</title>
		<content> Farmers make hay and silage for food  
 to keep the animals through the winter
 when there is no grass.               
 To start hay or silage you fence off a
 field to stop the animals from getting
 in.You spread fertilizer on the grass 
 to make the grass grow more quickly.It
 has to rain for the fertilizer to     
 work. Then you have to wait till about
 June July and August.{ HAY. }First you
 cut the grass . You wait for it to dry
 about a week.During the week you have 
 to turn it or else it goes bad. Then  
 you have to bale it and store it. Some
 farmers make hay into big bales thay  
 need a tractor to pick them up.       
{SILAGE. }For silage you have to mow   
 it.Then after mowing it you wilt      
 it(another name for drying just a bit)
 for collecting you can get it loose   
 then clamp it or put it in big bales  
 or bags.                              </content>
