		<content>  A special date for the school is May 
 Day Bank Holiday when the{May festival
 is celebrated.They dance around the   
 Maypole at{Ickwell Green}with children
 from Caldecote Lower and Northill     
 Lower Schools.                        
  After school the parents and         
 villagers sometimes use the school    
 hall for badminton amongst other      
 activites.                            
  Most of the children in the school   
 come from {Chicksands U.S. Air Base}as
 there is no school near them.They can 
 start school before the age of five   
 which is unusual for this area.There  
 are few children of school age living 
 in Old Warden village itself.
