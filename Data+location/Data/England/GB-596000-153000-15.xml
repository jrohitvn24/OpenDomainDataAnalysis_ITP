		<content> John Hann is a shepherd. He works on  
 the  Belmont Estate,where he tends 416
 ewes, 8 rams and 497 lambs (July 1985)
 The ewes are Scottish half breeds and 
 the rams are Suffolks.                
   During the lambing season (March-   
 April) he can work 17 hours a day, and
 during the winter from 5am to 6pm to  
 cope with Winter feeding.In the slack 
 Summer period he usually works 8am to 
 5pm. He can then mend fences and do   
 general maintainance work.            
   Shearing is carried by contractors  
 in June and the fleeces are sent to   
 the wool growers at Ashford. The fat  
 lambs are sold at Market when about   
 one year old for about Â£40.           
   The shepherd is responsible for the 
 health and welfare of the sheep. He   
 trims fleeces, gives medicines and    
 trims hooves. He keeps two collie dogs
 for rounding up.                      </content>
