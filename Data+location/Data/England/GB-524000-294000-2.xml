		<title>02Living on the Fens</title>
		<content>   Living on the fens has advantages   
 and disadvantages.                    
   When people live on the wide open   
 spaces of the fens they usually have a
 healthier atmosphere, less traffic    
 fumes because the wind disperses them 
 more quicky than in the town.         
   With reasonable sized gardens we can
 grow our own fresh vegatables and     
 fruit, but in a town you have to buy  
 them from the shops.  Living in the   
 town you are usually able to walk to  
 the shops for your weekly shopping, we
 had only one shop which was a Post    
 Office as well, this has closed now.  
   Children who live in the country    
 villages go to school either by bus or
 bicycle, this is also the transport   
 for families, unless they have a car. 
   Children's friends often live in the
 town so visiting them can be difficult
 especially if they have no car.       </content>
