		<title>08The Owners of Hexton Manor</title>
		<content> Hexton Parish consists of about 1500  
 acres and is contained within the     
 Hexton Manor Estate which is a little 
 larger. The Ashley Cooper family      
 bought the estate 50 years ago and Mr 
 Ashley Cooper has farmed and          
 administered it for 17 years. His     
 family live in Hexton Manor, an       
 ancient country house with 10         
 bedrooms. Village people, and         
 organisations with an interest in the 
 area, are frequently welcomed to the  
 Manor, its extensive gardens and      
 ornamental lake. Mrs Ashley Cooper    
 enjoys living in the village where she
 knows everyone. She supports the      
 Recreation Club, the Women's          
 Institute, the Youth Club and the Red 
 Cross. She plays the organ in Church  
 and arranges the weekly services with 
 the visiting Vicar. She is Chairman of
 the School Governors.                 </content>
