		<title>01Kielder &amp; Ridge End Burns</title>
		<content> This Grid block has as its main       
 feature the valleys of the Kielder    
 Burn and Ridge End Burn. These burns  
 have cut deep valleys in the moorland,
 most of which is now clothed in       
 coniferous woods planted by the       
 Forestry Commission.                  
 The Farm at{East Kielder}is the only  
 settlement in the area, and the only  
 access is by forestry road. This road,
 which connects{Kielder village}and    
{Byrness}is open to the public as a    
 Forest Drive.                         
 As yet the ridges of{Three Pikes}and  
{Hogswood Moor}stand clear of the      
 forest, with heather and mossy beds   
 surmounted by a series of small stone 
 cairns.
