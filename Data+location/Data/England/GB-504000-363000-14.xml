		<title>14Dunston School Plantation</title>
		<content> Dunston School has a plantation which 
 is close to Nocton Woods. The last    
 batch of trees was planted on 8.3.85. 
 The trees planted were oak, wild      
 cherry, silver birch, hairy birch,    
 ash and larch.A plaque marks the      
 beginning of the plantation.          
                           The planting
 led to a whole range of work eg       
 sketching, bark rubbing, measuring.   
 A display was arranged in the hall and
 a talk was given by the forester Mr.  
 J. Ockenden. The land is owned by     
 Nocton Farms but they have kindly     
 allowed Dunston School to use this    
 plantation for their contined studies.
