		<content> History of Gawsworth Rose Queen.      
 In Gawsworth we have a Rose Queen in  
 the summer.All of us in school vote   
 for a girl and she is crowned as      
 Queen.We have a procession through the
 village and all the girls wear pretty 
 dresses.                              
 There has been a Rose Queen in        
 Gawsworth since 1929, then it was     
 a girl called Daisy Hadfield, then    
 everyone from the school walked in a  
 procession to Gawsworth Hall, past    
 the Church to a field by the          
 Harrington Arms where the Queen was   
 crowned.Then the children did dancing 
 and had tea in a big tent. Later the  
 Queen was crowned in the Parish Hall  
 Now they are crowned on the school    
 field and we walk there from the      
 Parish Hall. Our Queen this year was  
 a girl called Katie Hogg.
