		<content> This is an open, undulating,          
 agricultural area with poor natural   
 drainage, exposed to winds throughout 
 the year.   The land is highest to the
 north.   Apart from small areas of    
 mainly deciduous woodland there are   
 few trees; generally rather poor      
 specimens with ash, Sycamore and Oak  
 predominating.   The primary          
 agricultural production is of         
 milk/beef with cereals, oil-seed, rape
 and intensively managed grass.   Most 
 of the relatively small population is 
 engaged in agriculture or commutes    
 into Darlington or Teesside.          
 Children travel out of the area to    
 school or college.   Since there are  
 few facilities for shpping or         
 organised recreation, and puplic      
 transport is infrequent, most families
 run a car.   Thus people can enjoy the
 peace of village and country life     </content>
