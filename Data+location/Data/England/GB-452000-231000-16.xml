		<content> A grant is given to the Village Club  
 annually.  Negotiations are in hand to
 purchase a piece of land in Portway to
 provide a play area for children on   
 that estate.   All planning           
 applications are sent to the Parish   
 Council by SNDC for comment, although 
 no regard need be taken of such       
 comment by the authority.  A bus is   
 provided for pensioners every         
 fortnight alternately to Banbury and  
 Bicester. The penny rate (a record 4p 
 at the moment to pay for the pavilion)
 is greatly enhanced by the population 
 at RAF Croughton, and raises about    
 Â£1500 at present. The Parish Council  
 employs a clerk, a cemetery caretaker,
 and a pensioner to clean the bus      
 shelter and children's playground.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
