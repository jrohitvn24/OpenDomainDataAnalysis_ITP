major town. There are over 50 shops,   
including Woolworths and a market. The 
second largest shopping place has 30-50
shops and is at the Scotlands;and joint
third largest shopping centres with 20 
-29 shops are at Ashmore Park,Fallings 
Park and Park Village.At the Scotlands 
the shopping centre is quite large     
because it is situated on the main

There are from 10-19 shops at Park     
Village, Newbolds, Showell Circus,     
Bushbury Lane,Northwood Park Road,Wood 
End, and Perry Hall. These have formed 
as houses have developed. There are    
even smaller shopping centres with     
less than 10 shops at Fallings Park,
