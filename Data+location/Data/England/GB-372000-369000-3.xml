		<content> An Older Person's Account (of changes 
 in the area in his lifetime)          
 Some changes took place in Byley when 
 water was supplied.  Years ago people 
 had to carry water from a pump, and on
 washday, from a brook.  Then          
 electricity came instead of paraffin  
 lamps.  There were no bathrooms, just 
 a tub in front of the fire hearth.    
 Cows used to be milked by hand but now
 it is done by machine.  Shire horses  
 were used for farm work, now tractors 
 are used.  Corn was cut by binder, now
 with a combine harvesters.  During    
 World War Two, Air Forces of Britain  
 and America were stationed in Byley.  
 An aircraft hangar and runways still  
 exist and there are American war      
 graves in the churchyard.  I have seen
 the M6 motorway built.  The Church    
 Hall was built recently, and the      
 village school has been modernised.   </content>
