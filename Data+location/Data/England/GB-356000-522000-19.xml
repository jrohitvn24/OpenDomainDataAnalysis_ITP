		<content>   For about 10 years there has been a 
 much used Parish Newsletter which,    
 although church based, contains much  
 village information.                  
    The September issue gives          
 information of the following kind:    
 church service times,details of       
 cathedral visit,harvest festival      
 details,result of church architects   
 visit,details of forthcoming meetings 
 of the Mothers Union,choir            
 festival,Bible discussion group,young 
 peoples group,over 60 club,handicraft 
 classes,domino drive and village hall 
 committee as well as the Vicar's      
 letter to the parish.                 
    This an excellent way to           
 communicate with all members of the   
 community and it also shows that the  
 area is active socially and that      
 activities are available for all      
 members whatever their age.           </content>
