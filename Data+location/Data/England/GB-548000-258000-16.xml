		<title>16Fen Ditton Hall Barn</title>
		<content> Mrs. Howell moved to Fen Ditton       
 Hall with her late husband 11 years   
 ago. The old barn in the Hall grounds 
 was falling down but because it was a 
 listed building it could not be       
 demolished. Mrs. Howell therefore had 
 it restored.                          
 The work done, a friend was permitted 
 to store his grand piano there        
 provided others could have access to  
 it.This led to a recital. Later a     
 local musician gave a concert in the  
 barn with some singers who were       
 students of his.                      
 This led on to other ideas, including 
 exhibitions and plays. Shakespeare's  
 "The Taming of the Shrew." has been   
 performed in the barn, and there has  
 been an exhibition of work by local   
 school children, but the most         
 successful venture was the staging of 
 the opera,"The Turn of the Screw."    </content>
