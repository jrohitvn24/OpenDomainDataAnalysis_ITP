		<title>02A Church in Wolverhampton</title>
		<content>St.Peter's Church stands in the centre 
of Wolverhampton,dominating the town   
and setting a fine example of local    
history.The present building is on a   
site originally occupied by a minster  
church built by Lady Wulfruna in 994   
AD.The large,mainly 15th century,parish
church is built of red stone and,after 
much restoration,appears as it did in  
the 16th century with the exception of 
the chancel,rebuilt completely in 1867.
At the entrance is a finely carved     
porch given in memory of Sir Charles   
Mander,a former Mayor of the Borough,  
who died in 1929.There is a gallery at 
the west end of the nave,erected by the
Company of Merchant Taylors for the use
of boys at the local Grammar School,of 
which they were governors.It bears the 
date 1616 and the herald of Sir Stephen
Jenyns,the school's founder.
