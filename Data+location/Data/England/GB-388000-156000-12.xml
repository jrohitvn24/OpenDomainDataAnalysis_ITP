		<content> There is no large amount of trade or  
 industry in the area as it is mainly a
 farming area.(see under FARMING)      
 There are a few haulage firms         
 locally,the largest being based in    
 Steeple Ashton:this was formerly      
 agricultural haulage but is now       
 general haulage.                      
 There are one or two small engineering
 firms dealing with both mechanical and
 agricultural repair work.             
 In Steeple Ashton there is a small    
 market garden and in Great Hinton     
 there is a small nursery.             
 There are several egg producing       
 chicken farms in the area.
