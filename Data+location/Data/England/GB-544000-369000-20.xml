		<title>20A Typical Day</title>
		<content>  I get up between 0730 and 0800,dress 
 and go downstairs for breakfast which 
 is usually cereals or toast.Then I    
 pack my bag and go to school where I  
 wait for my friends and go to the shop
 for some sweets.We go into school at  
 0900 and into assembly after register.
 Afterwards we do maths or English     
 until a break that lasts for 15       
 minutes.Then we do English or         
 maths until lunchtime when we eat our 
 sandwiches.In the afternoon we do     
 craft or games or social studies until
 1530 when we go home.There is a mid-  
 afternoon break at 1420 until 1430.   
  I have tea about 1630 then I go and  
 play until 2030 or 2100 when I go home
 and watch the television in bed before
 going to sleep.
