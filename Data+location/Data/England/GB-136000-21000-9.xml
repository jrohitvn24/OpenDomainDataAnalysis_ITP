		<title>09The Minack Theatre,St. Levan</title>
		<content> "Minack" comes from Cornish words     
 meaning a stony place. In 1929 a group
 of Cornish actors staged Shakespeare's
 "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in a      
 curving slope of meadow above a stream
 lined with elm, sycamore and willow . 
 "Next year", they said, "we'll do "The
 Tempest" in the cliff garden of Miss  
 Rowena Cade's house". Three people    
 took six months to make the 1932 grass
 stage and rough tiered seats built up 
 of dry walling and turf on the slope. 
 People were so gripped by the beauty  
 of the cliff at night, with the added 
 enjoyment of great poetry and live    
 music, that the theatre was kept      
 going. Modern stage and seats (with   
 play names and years engraved) were   
 added by Miss Cade as needed. New     
 dressing rooms modern lighting and    
 sound equipment help actors, a tea bar
 &amp; cushion hire help audience comfort. </content>
