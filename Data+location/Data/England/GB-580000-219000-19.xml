		<title>19BEN'S VIEWS ON SILVER END</title>
		<content> I like Silver End,which was built in  
 1926 for the Crittall workers and has 
 been growing ever since.The Diamond   
 Jubilee will be celebrated next year. 
 My family moved to our detached house,
 from Liverpool,last year.There are 3  
 churches in this village and I serve  
 at St.Mary's,the catholic church.In my
 class at school there are 3rd.and 4th.

 used to go to,but I like this one more
 Mum likes the handy Supermarket and   
 shops and friendly people.There is a  
 good social club and a library and big
 fields,for me to play football.I go to
 scouts and play with my friends in the
 park, where there's a pond and swings.
 I have a nice big garden and there are
 more flowers,trees and grass than in  
 Liverpool.It is not far to the country
 side.It's quieter and there's more    
 space and fresh air.I'm glad we moved.</content>
