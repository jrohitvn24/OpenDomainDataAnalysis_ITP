		<content>{ West Wantly Poutry Farm}             
 Since 1930 there has been a poutry    
 farm at West Wantley which covers 4   
 five acre fields and contains over    
 9000 birds kept in huts 6' by 9'.     
 These hold about 100 chicks each.They 
 are fed with a mash which is taken    
 round by tractor and trailer and put  
 into troughs.When the eggs hatch,the  
 chicks are seperated from their       
 mothers and put in a different pen and
 a record is kept of their birth dates.
  Some chickens are kept for laying and
 they usually live for about 3 years.  
 800 to 1000 eggs are sold each week,to
 shops,at the gate or delivered        
 personally.Laying Chickens are kept   
 seperate from the table chicken       
 which must be 16 weeks old before they
 get killed.3\ thousand chickens are   
 sold each year on the table and some  
 are sold alive.                       </content>
