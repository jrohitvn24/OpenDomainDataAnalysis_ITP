		<title>13LOCAL HISTORY W. LEOMINSTER</title>
		<content>   During the Second World War one of  
 the largest U.S. Military Hospitals in
 England was situated at Barons' Cross.
 Part of this site has now been built  
 on with houses.  The part of the      
 hospital still remaining has been     
 converted into a turkey farm.         
   Buildings now converted to the only 
 light industry in the area were once  
 specially built hostels to accommodate
 Land Army girls, brought to work on   
 the farms during manpower shortages of
 World War II.                         
   The Leominster-Kington railway line 
 used to run through the area.  This   
 was closed to passenger traffic in    
 1955, and completely in 1964.         
   Local farming used to be very       
 labour-intensive, but machinery now   
 mainly replaces this.  Farmers who    
 made their own cider partly paid farm 
 labourers with cider.                 </content>
