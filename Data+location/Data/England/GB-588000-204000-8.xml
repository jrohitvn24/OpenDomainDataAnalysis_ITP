		<content>   There are not many buildings in our 
 area because all of it is farmland,   
 wasteland and water.                  
   On  Iltney Farm there is a farmhouse
 some of which is about 500 years old; 
 a modern bungalow and some modern farm
 buildings. The farmsheds used to be   
 timber Essex barns but they were in a 
 bad state of repair and not ideal for 
 modern farming.                       
   On Freshfields there is an old      
 farmhouse and an Essex barn both      
 rented out.Mr. Rowsell,the owner,     
 lives in a house which was built      
 about 24 years ago. There are also 2  
 modern bungalows which were once      
 occupied by stockmen but are now      
 rented out.Two C19th cottages are     
 now derelict. This is due to the      
 change from dairy to arable farming   
 as well as the use of machinery.
