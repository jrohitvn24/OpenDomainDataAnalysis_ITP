		<content> MR.MITCHELL,a well known village      
 CHARACTER and owner of the            
 long-established family butcher shop  
 in the HIGH STREET,retired as CHIEF   
 FIRE OFFICER in FEB.1985 after 37     
 years service.When the FIRE STATION   
 SIREN sounded,voluntary firemen from  
 the village including MR.MITCHELL     
 stopped whatever they were doing      
 immediately and rushed to help.Today  
 an operator from the FIRE HEADQUARTERS
 in CHICHESTER sounds the alarm in     
 Partridge Green and between 4 and 6   
 village FIREMEN go to help.The area   
 includes:Cowfold,Ashurst,Dial         
 Post,West Grinstead and Shipley.When  
 interviewed MR.MITCHELL recalled an   
 empty house which smelt of smoke for a
 week before it was realised that the  
 house was on fire.
