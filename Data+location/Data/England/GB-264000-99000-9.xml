		<content>{THE POLICE}The police that work in    
 North Tawton are community police.    
 There are 2 of them and they drive    
 around in panda cars.The police       
 station is not run by men permanently.
 There are 2 houses near the station   
 for the police and their families     
 to live in.When there is a big        
 accident more police come into the    
 area.                                 
{FIRE}The fire men in North Tawton are 
 ordinary men with ordinary jobs.They  
 are volunteers who have volunteered   
 to be fire men.They carry a bleeper   
 with them every where they go.This is 
 radio controlled from Exeter.The fire 
 men then stop what ever they are      
 doing and rush to the fire station.   
{AMBULANCE}In North Tawton we need to  
 call ambulances out from Okehampton or
 Exeter.
