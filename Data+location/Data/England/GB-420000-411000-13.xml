		<title>13SCOUTS</title>
		<content> There is a scout troop in each        
 village in our area. I go to Emley    
 scouts every Tuesday from 7.00 to 9.00
 and we do lots of outdoor activities. 
 I have been potholing, canoeing and   
 climbing with them and I have been to 
 most of the normal meetings. We       
 normally go on camp every month. Once 
 every year we have a district camp    
 with scouts from all over this        
 district.Last year we went to         
 Appletreewick and this year we had one
 in the same place. They were both very
 good camps and I enjoyed the canoeing 
 because we were all canoeing up the   
 rapids. One of my friends got half way
 up and then lost control.  He snapped 
 a canoe because he hit a rock and the 
 canoe sank.
