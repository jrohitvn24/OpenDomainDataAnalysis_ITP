		<title>08HAMLETS NORTH OF PULBOROUGH</title>
		<content>  Apart from a few large houses,       
 farmhouses and farmworkers            
 cottages,there are two small hamlets  
 in this area, Codmore Hill and        
 North Heath.                          
  Codmore Hill is a suburb of          
 Pulborough with ribbon developement of
 family houses along the A29 and on    
 country roads east and west of the    
 Rose and Crown public house. This     
 community was also served by a grocers
 shop and dairy. The dairy has been    
 built over; and, after selling        
 antiques, the shop is now empty.      
  Gay Street Lane is the main          
 residential road in North Heath. Homes
 on the lane are a mixture of pre 1939 
 timber bungalows and modern houses.   
  Children from both hamlets used to   
 attend a primary school on the A29 but
 the school has now been converted to a
 dwelling-house.                       </content>
