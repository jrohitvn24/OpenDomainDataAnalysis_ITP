		<content>This section contains the small market 
town of Saxmundham (population 2371 )  
and the villages of Benhall (441) with 
Sternfield (113). The sixteen farms are
mostly arable and only a few have milk 
cows or steers for fattening.          
Saxmundham is bisected by the busy A12;
a by-pass is now to be included in the 
1986-87 road works. The single track   
rail links with Ipswich and Lowestoft, 
with a line to Sizewell Halt for       
nuclear waste collection.              
The population virtually stationary,   
was boosted in 1970-71 when an estate  
of 160 houses was built  for American  
Airforce families.                     
Sternfield House hosts members of the  
Royal Family  when they visit Suffolk  
ae owner works in the Queen's          
household.
