		<title>10POLEGATE CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> EVERY YEAR IN POLEGATE THERE IS A     
 CARNIVAL @ THE END OF JUNE. LOTS OF   
 PEOPLE DRESS UP IN FUNNY COSTUMES AND 
 JOIN A PROCESSION THAT LEADS ALONG    
 SAYERLANDS, OAKLEAF DRIVE AND DOWN THE
 HIGH STREET.                          
                                       
 ONE YEAR I DRESSED UP IN A DIRTY      
 COSTUME TO GO IN THE SCHOOL ENTRY AS  
 ONE OF THE ARTFUL DODGER'S GANG. LOTS 
 OF PEOPLE WATCH AND IT MAKES ME FEEL  
 PROUD. IN THIS YEAR'S CARNIVAL, I SAW 
 A MAN WHO WAS 3 SOLDIERS! HE NAMED    
 THEM TOM, DICK AND HARRY! HE WAS THE  
 MIDDLE ONE - DICK!                    
                                       
 AT THE END OF THE PROCESSION WE WENT  
 TO THE PARK WHERE THERE WERE LOTS OF  
 AMUSEMENTS, LIKE A RAFFLE, DARTS AND  
 THROWING BALLS INTO A JAR TO WIN A    
 PRIZE. IT WAS A BRILLIANT DAY.
