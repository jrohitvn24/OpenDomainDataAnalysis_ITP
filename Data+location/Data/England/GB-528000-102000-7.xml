		<title>07THE LANES</title>
		<content> The Lanes are Brightons top attraction
 after the seafront.They are a compact 
 series of streets containing over one 
 hundred antique shops.The name is     
 believed to have originated from the  
 Medieval word  "Leines" meaning a     
 place where fishermen dry their nets. 
   In 1833 the area was described as a 
 "A despised plebeian housing quarter  
 with a humble emporium of industry".  
   This has now become one of the most 
 famous and fashionable areas of       
 Brighton.Many visitors are able to    
 make expensive purchases of old       
 porcelain, ivory, bric-a-brac and     
 antiques, as well as sit in one of the
 many pleasant cafes and restaurants.
