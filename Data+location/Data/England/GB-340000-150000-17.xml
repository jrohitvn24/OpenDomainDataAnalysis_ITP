		<title>17A Day in the Life of Dafydd</title>
		<content> After play at school I do story       
 writing.We talk about our story       
 before we begin writing.At the end of 
 the morning I have another playtime   
 and a dinner of potatoes,peas and     
 sausage.In the afternoon I do Drama   
 and Art which is fun.I drew a picture 
 of a giant called Paul who did not    
 ever have Summer in his garden        
 because he was mean and never shared  
 his things.                           
    At 3:30 p.m.I go home and ride on  
 my bike with my older brother until   
 tea time.For tea I have salad and     
 crisps.I like to watch cartoon time on
 television with my mum and dad because
 we all laugh a lot.Sometimes I go to  
 Cubs where I play games and learn     
 about tracking and camping.At 7:30p.m.
 I go to bed and read my book for a    
 while before falling asleep.
