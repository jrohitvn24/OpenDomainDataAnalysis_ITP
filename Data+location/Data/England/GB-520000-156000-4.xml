		<content>   The main attraction of Village Week 
 was the{Pram Race}which certainly     
 attracted the crowds. Competitors and 
 spectators started gathering well     
 before the start.{Two team members    
 have to push a{third in a pram}around 
 the course{drinking a half pint of    
{beer}at each of three pubs on the     
 course.                               
   The tension was mounting as the     
 start came nearer.The race started    
 with the teams drinking a pint of beer
 and they were off down the road.      
 Thirty minutes later the winners      
 returned. We asked the competitors    
 some questions.They said Tadworth     
 Village Week is a good idea and they  
 hope it will be the same every year it
 is on.
