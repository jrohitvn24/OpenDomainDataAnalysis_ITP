		<title>10HISTORY OF BRAFFORD'S HALL.</title>
		<content>   Brafford's Hall has existed since   
 1776 and it has had nineteen owners   
 since then. The present owner has had 
 the Hall the longest as he has owned  
 it for twenty six years. He bought it 
 in 1959. Only two people live in the  
 Hall but there are three other people 
 living on the Estate. In 1940 the Army
 occupied it, but it has now returned  
 to agricultural use. In the past one  
 of the owners had a Grand National    
 winner. Four ladies have also owned   
 the Hall.
