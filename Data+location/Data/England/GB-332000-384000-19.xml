		<title>19  LIVING IN ROCK FERRY</title>
		<content>{Housing}is very mixed,{tower blocks,  
{flats, semi detached}but mainly       
{terraced houses. }The latter leads to 
 a very close community, where         
 grandparents and parents live in close
 proximity.  As one child commented':_ 
 "Most of my family live in Rock Ferry,
 my nana and grandad, my aunties and a 
 few relatives.  It's also nice to have
 your friends close by".  Family life  
 is close and people find it is a good 
{central spot for visiting.  North     
{Wales, New Brighton and Southport     
 being favourite weekend visiting      
 spots, while{Livepool and Birkenhead  
 provide more than adequate facilities 
 for{shopping and leisure. }Rock Ferry 
 itself is an area of small shops,but  
 unfortunately many of them have closed
 down for economic reasons.  There is  
 much unemployment and poverty.
