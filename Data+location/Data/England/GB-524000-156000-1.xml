		<content> The centre of the block is largely    
 unspoilt countryside, farmed in the   
 traditional manner, quite surprising  
 for an area so near major towns.      
 In the NW lies the village of Burgh   
 Heath, now bisected by the dual       
 carriageway A 217. Here are modern    
 council houses, as well as other      
 houses, old and new, overlooking the  
 large pond.                           
 The NE corner contains parts of the   
 villages of Woodmansterne and         
 Chipstead, with a variety of housing  
 styles, but mostly at a rather high   
 density.                              
 The SW corner is filled with very     
 attractive, tree-lined avenues, with  
 well spaced detached houses.          
 The branch railway line wends its way 
 from NE to SW, on its way from Purley 
 to Chipstead, Kingswood, Tadworth and 
 Tattenham Corner.                     </content>
