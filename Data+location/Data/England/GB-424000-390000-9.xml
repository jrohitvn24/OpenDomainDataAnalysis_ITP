		<title>09THE WORK OF A PARK RANGER.</title>
		<content> The Ranger,whose area of 86 sq.miles  
 includes our particular "BLOCK" is    
 Mr.Weekes &amp; he is assisted at the     
 weekend by volunteer rangers.His work 
 is interesting because it is so       
 diverse.Daily he patrols his area to  
 give information or assistance when   
 required.He helps farmers,particularly
 if there is an outbreak of foot &amp;     
 mouth disease.At another time he might
 be called out during the night because
 of an accident on the moors,when his  
 knowledge of the terrain means that a 
 search &amp; rescue can be undertaken     
 quickly.For eight days in August he   
 controls acess to the shooting moors. 
 He supervises volunteer parties which 
 pick up the litter of modern society  
 left by the unthinking visitor.Or     
 perhaps he liaises with the police to 
 catch thieves who steal the eggs of   
 rare birds.                           </content>
