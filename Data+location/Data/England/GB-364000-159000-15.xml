      Children seem to enjoy wearing   
 high heeled shoes,slip-ons,low-heeled 
 shoes and shoes with straps,as long as
 they are all brightly coloured.       
      Teenagers are especially keen on 
 wearing dark slip-on shoes.They don't 
 seem to like any other type of shoe.  
       Adults like all kinds of shoes  
 as long as they are not brightly      
 coloured.                             
   Slip-on shoes are popular with all. 
{HATS.                                 
     These are seldom liked.A few      
 berets and hats with veils were worn  
 occasionally by children.One brave    
 teenager liked to wear a cap.Guide    
 hats are worn but disliked by all but 
 one guide.Solitary adults wore        
 berets,woolly hats,hoods and veiled   
 hats.         {(Continued)
