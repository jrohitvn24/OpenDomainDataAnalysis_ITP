		<title>14A Day in the Life of...</title>
		<content> On Saturday I woke up at about        
 8.30a.m. After lying in bed a while I 
 looked out of the window and saw it   
 was a sunny day.I went into my        
 sister's bedroom to watch television  
 until mum brought us some porridge and
 a letter brought by the postman.About 
 10.00a.m. I went outside to play. Dad 
 was at work and mum was cleaning up.  
 I came in at 11.15a.m.,watched        
 television again and then did some    
 throwing and catching practice.Dad    
 came home early as my sister was ill  
 so that Mum and I could go into town  
 shopping.We ate our dinner of ham     
 sandwiches in the car park.At 3.00p.m.
 we returned home.I spent the afternoon
 in the garden reading and in the      
 evening we all watched a film about an
 adventure in space.By 9.30p.m. my     
 sister and I were in bed.
