		<content> This block is essentially rural with  
 agricultural land both arable and     
 pasture for beef cattle. There is a   
 certain amount of common land         
 at Weston Common; woodland at Little  
 Park and Humbly Grove and some        
 Forestry Commission plantations. A    
 recent development is the discovery of
 oil with a well at Humbly Grove and   
 one at Weston Common with a Collection
 and Distribution Centre. The total    
 population is very small and apart    
 from various farms, consists of the   
 village of Weston Patrick,part of     
 Weston Corbett and a small housing    
 estate at Powntley Copse. There are no
 shops or public houses but Weston     
 Patrick does have a church and a      
 village hall. There are no clubs but  
 some ladies are members of Upton Grey 
 Womens Institute who prepared this    
 survey.                               </content>
