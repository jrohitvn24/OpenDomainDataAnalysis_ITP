		<content>{THE CHURCH OF SAINT MICHAEL}ON TUESDAY
 MORNING CLASS THREE WENT TO THE CHURCH
 AND I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY GOOD   
 THERE BECAUSE I LEARNT ALOT MORE ABOUT
 THE CHURCH THAN I KNEW BEFORE I WENT  
 THERE.IT WAS BUILT IN 1430.I NEVER    
 KNEW THAT THERE WERE ANY GRAVES IN THE
 CHURCH.THERE IS AN EAGLE WAS MADE OF  
 OAK AND SO WERE THE SEATS. THERE WAS  
 AN OWL AND I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS FOR  
 FRIGHENING THE MICE AWAY BUT IT WAS TO
 FRIGHEN AWAY A PLAGUE OF BATS THAT    
 THEY DID HAVE.I WAS VERY SURPRISED    
 ABOUT THAT.I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH. {  
{THE RIVER TEIGN-WHAT IT MEANS TO ME   
 IT IS A NICE PLACE TO SWIM BUT COLD.  
 I DONT THINK THAT ANY FAMOUS PAINTER  
 HAS EVER PAINTED THE RIVER TEIGN.WE   
 USUALLY GO THERE WHICH IS GREAT FUN.  
 ONCE WE FOUND AN OLD SMASHED CANOE ON 
 THE ROCKS.WE HAVE A RAFT MADE OUT OF  
 PLASTIC CONTAINERS WHICH WE SHARE WITH</content>
