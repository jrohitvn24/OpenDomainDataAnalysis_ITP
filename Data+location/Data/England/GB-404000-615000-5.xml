		<content> As well as lambing, dipping and       
 dressing sheep for shows and the      
 September breeding sales, a lot of    
 other work is done through the year.  
 Sheep have to be dozed and their feet 
 clipped. They have to be injected for 
 all different kinds of diseases. Hay  
 has to be got in for their Winter     
 feed.Sheds are prepared to bring sheep
 into for the Winter - though not all  
 farms around here do this. Wool is    
 clipped and wrapped.                  
 Sheepdog training starts at about six 
 months old. The trainer aims to get   
 basic obedience to start with. Then it
 all depends on the dog how long the   
 training takes. Some dogs are quick   
 and you can have them running at one  
 yearold. Other dogs it takes until    
 they are two or three years old before
 they are any good. Sheepdog trials    
 start in May and finish in October.   </content>
