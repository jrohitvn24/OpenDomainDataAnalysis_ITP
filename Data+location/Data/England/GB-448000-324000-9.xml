		<title>09Traffic in Kegworth.</title>
		<content> In a recent traffic survey in{Kegworth
 431 vehicles travelled along the{A6}in
 30 mins. Of these 285 were cars and   
 146 were lorries or vans. For some    
 people through traffic can be a       
 nuisance. Dirt and dust can cause     
{pollution}and the traffic is dangerous
 for small children. In the last 2 yrs.
 a bus has run into a shop in the      
 village centre and a lorry shed its   
 load demolishing part of an old house 
 on{London Road.}Fortunately injuries  
 were slight but the danger is clearly 
 there. Plans are being made for a     
{bypass}but if this happens garges will
 lose a lot of trade. The{bypass}will  
 go from the{A6}Loughborough road,     
 opposite the pub named the {White     
{House,}to join the{M1/A42}junction    
 near Diseworth. Once completed the new
 road will ensure that no heavy lorries
 are allowed into the village.         </content>
