		<title>06My day at Wroxall School.</title>
		<content>  I left my house at 8.30,played until 
 "intime",then read "Zozu the Robot".We
 fed the rabbit,collected the dinner   
 numbers and rang through to Ventnor   
 central kitchens.From 9.45 I did      
 weighing  for maths.At 10.45 we went  
 out to play and I skipped.            
  At 11.00 I wrote about Mr.W.who went 
 to our school in 1920,for our Domesday
 Project.At 12.00 we went to lunch,I   
 had sandwiches,a chocolate biscuit    
 some crisps and a blackcurrant drink. 
 I cleared the plates and tables,then  
 I went out to play and skipped.       
  In the afternoon we had to draw      
 shapes to see if they tesselate       
 (circles and pentagons don't but      
 squares and triangles do).At playtime 
 I skipped again then I showed the     
 school the water turbine I made out of
 a plastic bottle.At 3.00 I walked     
 home.                                 </content>
