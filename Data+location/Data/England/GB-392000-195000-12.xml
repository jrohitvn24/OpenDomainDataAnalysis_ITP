		<title>12KEMBLE AIRFIELD</title>
		<content> Part of Kemble airfield was in our    
 block. We found out that it is owned  
 by the R.A.F. though the U.S. airforce
 has used the base since 1983          
 together with the R.A.F. In one       
 hanger the R.A.F. are repairing naval 
 fixed wing planes (identifiable from  
 foreign ones by transmitters). The    
 heaviest plane that lands there is the
 Hercules( over 20 tons). There are 470
 staff, some are civilians. They have  
 an A10, nick named tank buster. It    
 fires bullets the size of coke bottles
 which go straight into a tank shell.  
 The fastest plane there is an F 15.   
 They also have F 4 &amp; F 5. They recruit
 British men. There are 3 fire tenders 
 and 8 crews. They have a Dodge Mk 11. 
 It has 8 times the foam capacity of   
 normal fire engines and it has water  
 as well.
