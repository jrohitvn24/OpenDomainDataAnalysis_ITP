		<content> In recent years Clarendon Estate has  
 developed Pheasant and Partridge      
 breeding as part of its land use.     
 There are two breeds of partidge,     
 English and French also pheasant, in  
 incubators and rearing pens. They are 
 sited on the south facing slope of the
 valley below the ruins of Clarendon   
 Palace, and opposite the 'jousting    
 field' where some 700 years ago       
 knights battled to gather the favours 
 of the Ladies of the Royal Court, and 
 no doubt where many other blood sports
 were held. Here some 8000 chicks each 
 year are scrupulously reared before   
 they are released into the surrounding
 trees and vegetation. The chicks are  
 'beak ringed' for a time to protect   
 them from beak pecking habbits while  
 they are young. Here they grow until  
 the shooting season starts, when they 
 pit their wits agaist the local shoot.</content>
