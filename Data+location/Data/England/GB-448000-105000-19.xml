		<title>19Types of housing</title>
		<content>  We were interested to find out about 
 the different types of houses in our  
 area.We did a survey of the houses of 
 children in our school.               
  The most common type of house was the
{semi-detached},but many people lived  
 in{detached},{terraced}or{bungalows}. 
  An interesting type of house peculiar
 to this area is the  "{strawberry}"   
 house. This is unusual because it has 
 three windows on the upper floor and  
 an arch over the front door.These     
 houses have very large gardens,and    
 were all built in about{1860}by the   
 same builders.The people who lived in 
 them were{strawberry growers}.The     
{strawberry industry}is the oldest     
 industry of the{Locks Heath} area and 
 a lot of strawberries are still grown 
 here.                                 
  Many{new estates}are now being built 
 with a variety of{modern houses}.     </content>
