		<content>    The Great Fire started at 3pm 29th 
 July 1896. It went out of control in  
 the Rickyard of King's Farm which was 
 opposite two thatched cottages behind 
 the Rising Sun Inn.                   
    A telegram to Superintendant Collet
 of Swindon Police Force brought the   
 Fire Brigade to Wroughton but little  
 was achieved. Fanned by a breeze the  
 flames quickly spread and many        
 cottages caught fire. By 4:30 the     
 Wooton Bassett Brigade had arrived but
 the problem was water and the fire    
 continued to spread.                  
    By evening the wind had subsided   
 and rain fell and at last the fire was
 put out but there was complete        
 devastation with 100 people homeless  
 and enormous damage.                  
    A relief fund was set up and within
 a week Â£200 had been collected for the
 homeless.                             </content>
