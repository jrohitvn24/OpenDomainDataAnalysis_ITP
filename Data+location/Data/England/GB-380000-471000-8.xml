		<content> The population of the village is much 
 the same now as it was 120 years ago. 
 The 1870 census shows a steep rise in 
 population due to the presence of     
 workers building the Settle-Carlisle  
 Railway, who were housed in shanty    
 towns close to their work.            
                                       
 The opening of Horton Quarry in 1887  
 also led to a rise in population.     
 After 1960, when farming and quarrying
 became increasingly mechanised the    
 population declined to its pre-1870   
 level.  The village is a stable       
 community with a balanced spread of   
 age groups.  Outwardly there is no big
 gulf between rich and poor;  nor are  
 strong class differences apparent.    
 Twenty years ago most people belonged 
 to families which went back for 100   
 years or more.  New-comers are moving 
 in but they are still a minority.     </content>
