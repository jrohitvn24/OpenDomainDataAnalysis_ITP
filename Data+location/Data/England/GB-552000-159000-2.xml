   Otford has a new Vicar. He has been 
at Otford for five months and he    e  
thinks that the "natives are friendly" 
but he feels like a new boy on his     
first day at school. He has had six    
previous churches, some in towns and   
others in villages. He feels the Otford
people are very polite and he feels    
very welcome. He is responsible for    
4000 parishioners here.                
   A Vicar is constantly having to     
change his mood according to people's  
problems. He would like a little more  
informality in church worship here but 
there must be a different service to   
suit different people. For example     
older people like a more traditional   
service whilst young children need more
informality. We were shown the altar,  
pulpit, lectern and the vestry.
