		<title>17Berwick village</title>
		<content> The village of Berwick comprises Upper
 and Lower Berwick, and the more modern
 part which developed by the railway   
 station is simply called Berwick.     
 Berwick straggles along the B2l08 on  
 which the traffic is regularly halted 
 by the closed level crossing gates.   
 The post office and public house lie  
 on the south side of the crossing,    
 with the village shop, taxi service   
 and garage/petrol station on the      
 other, plus the recreation ground with
 wooden club house. The houses are     
 mainly detached, individual in style, 
 ranging in date from l850 to l930 and 
 the l980s. North of the railway on the
 western side of the road is a row of  
 detached houses with unusually long   
 front gardens but with no garages or  
 pavement. Opposite is a row of        
 semi-detached houses many with        
 garages and fronted by a footpath.    </content>
