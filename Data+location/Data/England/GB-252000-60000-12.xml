		<content> A few Bronze agehut circles remain on 
 the moor. Similar circles which were  
 in danger of  obliteration by china   
 clay spoil were recently exavated and 
 one was removed to Tavistock school.  
 The Plymouth and Launceston railway   
 ceased to run through the area iv 1963
 and the industrial tram line from the 
 china clay works was dismantled       
 earlier.                              
 During World War II German            
 bombers used 3 white china clay spoil 
 heaps as markers for their raids on   
 Plymouth. Two of these heaps,now      
 overgrown are near Wotter.            
 China clay waste is very infertile and
 erodes badly so ettempts at camouflage
 involved covering the slopes with nets
 and planting specially chosen plants  
 in the holes.                         
 Mass felling of trees in great Shaugh 
 Wood was also part of the war effort. </content>
