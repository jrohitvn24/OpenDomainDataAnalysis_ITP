		<title>18Sparkbrook 1885-1985  B'ham</title>
		<content>In 1885 Sparkbrook was a quiet and rich
area. It was clean with large houses,  
some farms and no factories or         
industry. The River Spark was an open  
brook going from east to west and      
joining the River Cole. Today          
Sparkbrook is built up, with a main    
road and part of the inner ring road   
going past our school. Several of the  
children live in shops. Joanna's dad   
has a Chip shop, Sharon's dad has an   
Off-Licence, Taruna's dad keeps the    
Post Office whilst Imran's and Najma's 
famillies have Grocery Stores. The     
river is culverted and the farms have  
had houses built on them. The houses   
are small terraces. In 1900 our school 
was built on Hind's Farm. Today        
Sparkbrook is busy with shops, cars,   
lorries, buses and lots of people. In  
1885 only horses, carts and some new   
trams ran on the cobbled roads.        </content>
