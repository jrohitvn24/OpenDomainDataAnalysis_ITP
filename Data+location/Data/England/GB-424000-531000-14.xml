		<content> In the yard we play{tag,}where someone
 is on and he chases other people and  
 tags them and then they're on. As well
 as tag we play{football}or{knock out  
 where one person is in goal and the   
 others tackle to score a goal. The one
 who scores last is out and we just    
 keep on playing until there is a      
 winner. Sometimes we play{bulldog     
 where one person is on and we have to 
 run from one den to another without   
 being caught. We also play{King}where 
 we are in a circle and if the ball    
 goes through your legs you are on and 
 you have to throw the ball at other   
 people then they are on. Some people  
 play{skipping games}or{two ballie.    
 They sing songs as they are playing.  
 Sometimes{marbles}or{conkers}are      
 played. In winter we have{snowball    
 fights and make{slides.}Some people   
 play on{roller boots.                 </content>
