		<title>04MORE ABOUT WARBOYS CLOCK</title>
		<content> Mr. Taylor the man that looks after   
 the {Clock Tower }has to wind it up   
 every 8 days but he winds it up every 
 Sunday morning. Mr. Taylor winds it up
 with an old car handle called a crank.
 The crank is stiff because of the     
 weather conditions inside, but it     
 hasn't rusted. The conditions of the  
 works inside were very clean , there  
 was a bit of oil inside so it could   
 work properly .                       
 The {Clock Tower}was for the Jubilee  
 of {Queen Victoria}. It has arches    
 underneath it. It is brick built. It  
 is situated at a fork in the road     
 which is in the middle of where the   
 High Street meets Ramsey Road and     
 Church Road.It is a landmark of       
 Warboys.There are two street lights   
 attached to the {Clock Tower.}Some    
 people say they spoil the clock's     
 appearance.                           </content>
