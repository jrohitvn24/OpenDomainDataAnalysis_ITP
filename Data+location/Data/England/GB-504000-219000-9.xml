		<title>09ENTERTAINMENT MUSIC POP</title>
		<content>In a class survey at Rotheram High     
'pop' music came out on top to the     
almost entire exclusion of other music 
forms.  The most popular were groups   
Wham, Duran Duran, Sister Sledge, and  
the Five Star. Michael Jackson, Paul   
Hardcastle with Vietnam 19 were also   
mentionned more than twice.  Reggae    
style music was included by one, but a 
larger number were keen on music for   
bod popping and break dancing.         
The reasons for choice were the good   
beat and sounds, one person expressed  
the view that a solo artiste didn't    
provide enough music, they liked 4 or 5
in a group. Some liked slow and fast   
music.  The Bucks Fizz group's win at  
the 1981 European Song Contest was also
noted. One who liked Duran Duran       
thought they had good singers and      
instruments. He thought they were rich 
and could do lots of concerts , discs. </content>
