		<content> The education of the children within  
 our area at a primary level is catered
 for by the Primary School at          
 Greatworth.                           
 There are seventy two children on roll
 at present and they are taught by four
 full time teachers. The children are  
 organised into classes according to   
 their age. The age range is from 4+ _ 
 11 years.                             
 Development of the school building has
 recently taken place with remodelling 
 of part of the original classroom     
 taking place along with additional    
 practical facilities being built.     
 Transport is provided for the children
 from Marston St Lawrence who are      
 brought to the school by bus in the   
 morning and taken home in a taxi when 
 school closes at 3.45pm.
