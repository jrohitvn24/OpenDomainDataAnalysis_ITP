  Windsurfing is a sport that my Dad   
 does. He has been doing it for three  
 years now.Lots of people have         
 sailboards in Brixham. I think there  
 is a sailboarding club, but I don't   
 know for sure. You need to have the   
 right kind of weather for windsurfing.
 If it is calm you won't get very far, 
 but if it is too rough then you will  
 find it difficult to get back in      
 again.                                
  There are four parts to the wind     
 surfer:-the board which you stand on, 
 the boom, which attaches to the sail, 
 which you hold on to,and the battens  
 which go onto the sail to stiffen it. 
  Yoiu need to be quite tall and strong
 to windsurf because the sail is quite 
 heavy when it collects a bit of water.
 You can get different sizes of sail   
 boards.                               </content>
