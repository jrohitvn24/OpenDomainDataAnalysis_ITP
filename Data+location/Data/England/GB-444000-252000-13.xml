		<title>13Wormleighton Crop Rotation</title>
		<content> Crop rotation is still carried on by a
 minority of farmers who are concerned 
 that the land should be well cared    
 for. Hall Farm has over one thousand  
 acres and their crop rotation is as   
 follows - firstly grass, three wheat  
 crops, a barley crop, and finally oil 
 seed rape or oats, returning to       
 grass on the seventh year. Some       
 farmers practice intensive farming    
 which produces corn continuously but  
 even today with all the chemicals and 
 fertilisers used many farmers suspect 
 that this land will eventually be     
 worked out.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
