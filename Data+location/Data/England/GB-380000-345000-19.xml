		<title>19Recreation in  Silverdale</title>
		<content>The Allotments are like a little farm. 
They are rented by people who have no  
garden to their house.Growing food here
is cheaper than buying it from a shop  
and much fresher.The people who rent   
the  allotments are worried because the
local council may take the land for    
building new houses.                   
In Silverdale some children have built 
a BMX stunt ramp.It is not for high    
jumps but for freestyle riding.They all
helped to make it from scrap wood and  
saved up for the paint to make sure    
it doesn't rot. Much leisure time      
is spent at the public library in      
Silverdale.When a book is chosen,it is 
taken to the desk where a card is      
put through the computer.The library   
provides magazines,papers,records and  
hundreds of books.It also supplies     
information and maps or guides.It has  
news of evening classes &amp; entertainment</content>
