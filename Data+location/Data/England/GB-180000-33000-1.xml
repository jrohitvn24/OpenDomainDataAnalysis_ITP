		<content>   The area we are surveying for the   
 l985 Domesday Project, includes the   
 village of Flushing, a small part of  
 Falmouth and Falmouth harbour, and a  
 large part of Carrick Roads (the      
 estuary of the River Fal). The area   
 contains mostly agricultural land with
 some wooded areas, a village          
 community and a residential area.     
                                       
    We chose to concentrate on the     
 Flushing area because it was within   
 the catchment area of our school and  
 the older children of the village     
 attend the comprehensive school in    
 Penryn.                               
                                       
    The village of Flushing was given  
 it's name by Dutch immigrants who     
 settled in this fishing community     
 during the 17th century.
