		<title>11KENNICOTT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Kennicott is a 6th form school,it is  
 part of Kevics (King Edward the 6th   
 college).It is just down the road     
 from the college so they dont have to 
 walk far,It was built by the Singer   
 family that now are Singer sewing     
 machines,but four years ago it was a  
 boarding school for boys.Where        
 Kevics is now was the Singer family's 
 garden.Kennicott is just for 6th      
 formers and the privilege of being    
 there is you dont have to wear school 
 uniform.The rest of the school is     
 divided into two sites,lower &amp; main   
 school,separated by a main road.Lower 
 school is for age 11 &amp; main school 12 
 to 16s.
