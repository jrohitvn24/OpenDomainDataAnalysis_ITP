		<title>16R.A.F. WADDINGTON</title>
		<content>   Until last year R.A.F Waddington was
 a station for Vulcan bombers. At      
 present they are beginning trials for 
 the AWACs (early-warning radar        
 aircraft).               Because of   
                                       
                                       
 problems, however, the whole future of
 the new system and of Waddington is in
 doubt. So, for now, there are only two
 Vulcans and one Nimrod stationed at   
 Waddington. This has meant a big drop 
 in the number of servicemen.          
   On the camp there is a junior ranks 
 club, a corporals club, a sergeants   
 mess and an officers mess. There are  
 two churches, an education centre with
 library, a nursery, a theatre, a      
 sports hall, sports field and a       
 swimming pool. There are fire, repair 
 and engineering shops and briefing and
 flight planning and control rooms.    </content>
