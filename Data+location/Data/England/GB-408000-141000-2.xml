		<content> At the windy crossroads at the        
 junction of the A360/A344 and B3086   
 there stands a monument in memory of  
 military flying on Salisbury Plain. As
 pilots qualified, early test          
 experience was gained in flying over  
 this area. But alas one crashed close 
 to where the monument stands today.   
 Military flying over this area        
 continues today with a wide variety of
 aircraft. Lynx, Gazelle, Chinook, Puma
 Wessex and Scout helicopters are used 
 to carry troops and equipment whilst  
 on exercises. Hercules aircraft carry 
 heavy loads and parachutes to the     
 dropping zones. Testing continues too 
 on the Harrier, Buccaneer, Phantom,   
 Jaguar and Tornado, now in service    
 with the R.A.F. in this area. Vapour  
 trails from high-flying airliners     
 i.e.Concorde, V.C.10's etc. en-route  
 to London or the continent can be seen</content>
