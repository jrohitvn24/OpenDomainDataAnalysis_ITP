		<title>20Electricity Sub-station</title>
		<content> The fifteen acre site at Dunston      
 (GR218024) which contains the         
 sub-station is owned and run by the   
 Central Electricity Generating Board. 
 It is controlled automatically by a   
 computer.                             
 The Sub_station consists of three     
 transformers which receive power from 
 Walpole near Kings Lynn at 400        
 kilovolts and transforms it to 132kv  
 for transmission to local stations    
 supplying Norwich and the Wymondham   
 area. At these sub_stations it is     
 transformed to 11kv and is hen        
 transmitted to the homes an businesses
 of the area. The lines carrying the   
 electricity are supported by large    
 pylons which are a dominant feature of
 the landscape.
