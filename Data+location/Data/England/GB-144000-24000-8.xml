		<title>08Mousehole Bird Hospital</title>
		<content>    {Mousehole}has had a{Bird Hospital 
 and Sanctuary since 1928 when it was  
 founded by the Misses D. and P.       
 Yglesias. The aim of the hospital is  
 to accept any{bird}in need of care, to
 heal them and return them to the wild.
 If the latter is not possible then the
 birds are provided with sanctuary for 
 the rest of their lives.              
     Although any bird in need is      
 accepted into care, and some rare     
 species that have been blown off      
 course over the Atlantic have been    
 cared for, it is mostly sea birds that
 are catered for. Many of these suffer 
 from the effects of oil which has been
 dumped at sea by oil{tankers}cleaning 
 their tanks, this is then picked up on
 the birds feathers and then enters the
 their stomachs in their attempts to   
 clean themselves.
