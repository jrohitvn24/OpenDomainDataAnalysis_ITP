		<content>      "DON'T STEP ON THE EGGS"         
   This is a game played at parties.You
 can play this game with as many people
 as you want. You have 4 people to set 
 it out. They lay some eggs out in a   
 row - well spaced.You send half the   
 prople out of the room.Collect up the 
 eggs and replace them with crisps.Now 
 bring in one person,blindfolded and   
 tell them you are going to lead them  
 round the eggs and tell them when to  
 put their foot down. After leading    
 them for a little while,purposefully  
 let them put their foot down on the   
 crisps.They will then think they have 
 then{"Stepped on the eggs"}and will   
 scream and panic. Do this a couple    
 more times and then take off their    
 blindfold and tell them to sit down   
 quietly. Bring in another person to   
 play the game.
