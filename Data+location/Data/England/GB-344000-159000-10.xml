		<content> Each Saturday I get up at 8.30am and  
 have breakfast .I switch on Radio 1   
 with pop music and listen to  First   
 Loves where people write in about     
 their first love affairs .At 12.30pm I
 have a snack dinner then I go out. I  
 usually go to Ladymead Lane to see if 
 anybody is playing. Sometimes I play  
 block or football. If there is not    
 anyone there, I go home. Tea is at    
 5.3Opm. It is a cooked meal. I put the
 dishes into the dishwasher and I go   
 out. Back at 8.3Opm, watch T.V. till  
 1O.30. On Sunday morning I get up at  
 8.3Oam, breakfast is egg and bacon.   
 9.15am I go to Sunday School. It      
 starts at 9.3O and finishes at 1O.3O. 
 Sundays roast dinner is about 1.3Opm  
 to 2.OOpm. After dinner my Dad might  
 take us to visit relations, back at   
 5.OOpm for tea. Then I go out again.
