		<title>12Warbleton &amp; Buxted Band</title>
		<content> The brass band was formed in l896.    
 Recently membership has been falling  
 though there are still l9 players     
 including 4 juniors and 7 females.    
 Advertisements have been made for more
 players without success but it is     
 hoped to introduce young people and   
 teach them from scratch. Rehearsals   
 take place twice a week at the Dunn   
 village Hall. There is no full time   
 band master at present and the        
 conducting has been undertaken by     
 three people - Mrs Beryl Unsted,Mr    
 Keith Buss &amp; his son Martin Buss. This
 is a family tradition for the Buss    
 family have provided three previous   
 bandmasters. During the summer season 
 music was provided at several local   
 fetes &amp; also at the Festival of       
 Remembrance at the White Rock Theatre 
 Hastings.Carols will be played in     
 local villages &amp; at Warbleton Church. </content>
