		<content>    Only a few householders in the area
 are without cars today and therefore  
 people have little difficulty in      
 travelling further afield than in the 
 past.  The inn at Goose Green is a    
 popular meeting place and attracts    
 people from the local towns.          
    Fund raising events organised by   
 the Church of England, village hall   
 committee and Cumberland Farmers Fox- 
 Hounds form the nucleus of entertain- 
 ment for all.  People entertain their 
 friends in their homes and the Womens 
 Institute, that meets monthly, also   
 provides entertainment to the women.  
    Those that do not both live and    
 work in the area often enjoy a larger 
 and more scattered circle of friends. 
    Large private parties are          
 organised for 21st birthdays,         
 weddings and anniversaries and attract
 a large attendance.                   </content>
