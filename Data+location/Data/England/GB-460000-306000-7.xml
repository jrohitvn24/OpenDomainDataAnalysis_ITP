		<title>07ALAKA'S DAY</title>
		<content> I woke up at 6.26 a.m.,I couldn't get 
 back to sleep so I got up at 7.03.    
 Dressed myself and went down to mum.I 
 washed and cleaned myself then left   
 home and went to pick up my friend on 
 the way to school.First we had        
 registration then Biology and Maths.  
 At dinner we had egg on toast with    
 chips (and sauce!).We went back to    
 school and had English and Art.I was  
 really tired so I was glad to get     
 home.For tea we had home-made pizza,it
 was scrumptious.First of all I watched
 a bit of "telly" and at 7.00p.m. went 
 to my grandma's house.There I watched 
 more T.V. and played cards.When we got
 home we had dinner.After this I was so
 tired that I went to sleep straight   
 away.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
