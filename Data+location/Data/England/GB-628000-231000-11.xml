		<content> Over a century ago, an eccentric      
gentleman called Colonel George Tomline
 who lived in a large house on         
the banks of the River Orwell at Nacton
between Ipswich and Felixstowe, wanted 
to commercialise his other property on 
the Landguard area of Felixstowe.  He  
built a railway line from Westerfield  
to link Felixstowe with the then flour-
ishing Great Eastern Railway and event-
ually, he hoped, with the industrial   
Midlands. Named the Felixstowe Railway 
and Pier Co., the first train arrived  
in Felixstowe at the Beach Station in  
May 1877.                              
Tomline also had the creek             
entrance dug out, which was the start  
of the Felixstowe Dock and Railway     
Company.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
