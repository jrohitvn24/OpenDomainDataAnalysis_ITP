		<title>12FARMING IN NORTH SHROPSHIRE</title>
		<content>  We visited farms in North Shropshire.
 Mr Hardy at Kinsell farm has mostly   
 grazing land the rest is for silage.We
 asked him if the wet June weather had 
 affected him.He said that it has put  
 him back for silage.Mr Hardy has some 
 hay too.He has got 238 acres of land. 
 There are twelve farms in our         
 rectangular grid. Lane Farm is my     
 Dad's. He is a dairy farmer but       
 makes hay as well, he has no corn. In 
 our area there are eleven farms of    
 different sizes. The largest farm is  
 Kinsell Farm of 238 acres,but most are
 about 100 acres.My father's Farm is 87
 acres. The best time of the farming   
 year is when we make hay. I like to   
 help stack the bales. We can get a ton
 of hay on one trailer. At the farm I  
 put them on top of the elevator. It   
 certainly is a hot job to do, if you  
 have shorts on the hay scratches legs.</content>
