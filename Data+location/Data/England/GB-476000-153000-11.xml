		<title>11Winchfield Area - Industry.</title>
		<content> There isn't much in the way of        
 industry within the block. Planning   
 permission has been granted for       
{industrial units}to the south of      
 Winchfield Station but work hasn't    
 commenced yet. They will be ideal for 
 local people just starting out in     
 business. Several people have{small   
{businesses}in the former goods yard.  
{'Winchfield Pottery'}is also close to 
 the railway station. The Potter has   
 been there since 1972 &amp; she special-  
 ises in making wall clocks, many of   
 which have gone abroad as presents.   
 Most of her pottery is 'thrown' on a  
 wheel &amp; is made of stoneware or       
 porcelain. At Phoenix Green there is a
 young{farrier}who has been trading in 
 the old smithy since 1977 (see photo- 
 graph &amp; caption). There is also a     
{wholesale nursery}at Winchfield Lodge 
 which deals mainly with 'Heathers'.   </content>
