    Trethevy Quoit is a Bronze Age     
 burial chamber at Trethevystone, 1.5  
 miles  NE of  St. Cleer. It was built 
 about 1500 B.C. It consists of seven  
 stones making two chambers, with a    
 stone across the top that weighs 18   
 tons. The stones were dragged from    
 Caradon Hill, 3 miles away.  The      
 capstone has a hole in it at one      
 end.  The spaces between the large    
 stones were filled with little        
 rocks, and then covered by a huge     
 mound of earth. The mound has now     
 gone, leaving only the stones.  The   
 Quoit held about 20 bodies.           
                                       
    The custom of burial mounds        
 originated in the Mediterranean       
 countries in the Stone Age.
