		<content> With a high proportion of the parish's
 under 14 year olds living in faulkland
 itself, it is significant that there  
 are no provisions for either          
 pre-school or youth club activities in
 the village.  There is however a      
 thriving branch of the Women's        
 Institute in the parish, and the      
 annual village celebration of the     
 Faulkland flower show combines the    
 traditional flower, fruit and         
 vegetable display with sideshows and  
 entertainments.  During the period    
 when this study was being carried out,
 the Faulkland Post office which was   
 also a general store, re-opened.  Also
 during this period the garage ceased  
 selling petrol.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
