		<content>THIS SITE CALLED BLACKLANDS IS 3/4 OF A
MILE NORTH OF KINGS SUTTON AND 3 MILES 
SOUTH-EAST OF BANBURY.THE NAME IS      
THOUGHT TO HAVE COME FROM THE VERY DARK
COLOUR OF THE SOIL.IT IS SITUATED ON A 
HILL WITH A VIEW DOWN THE CHERWELL     
VALLEY.THE TOTAL SITE IS BETWEEN 20 AND
30 ACRES.AN OLD ROAD CROSSES THE SITE  
AND THE RIVER CHERWELL AT TWYFORD (TWO 
FORDS?).                               
FINDS ON THE SITE HAVE INCLUDED SEVERAL
SKELETONS,URNS,FOUNDATION WALLS AND    
COINS.THE COINS MADE OF BRASS,SILVER   
AND BASE METALS ARE LOCALLY KNOWN AS   
"BLACKLAND PENCE".                     
IT WOULD SEEM LIKELY THAT THE BUILDINGS
ON THIS SITE WOULD HAVE HAD THATCHED   
ROOVES,WOODEN WALLS AND STONE          
FOUNDATIONS.THEY MAY HAVE BEEN         
DESTROYED BY FIRE.
