		<title>11MARWOOD N. A COUNCIL FARM</title>
		<content>    Some of the farms around our block 
 are owned by Devon County Council and 
 are rented out to tenants.            
    We went to Over Crockers farm which
 is rented to Mr. and Mrs. Briggs and  
 their young family.They have lived    
 there for 3 years.Their farm is a     
 starter farm and they were selected   
 from over 100 couples by a series of  
 interviews.                           
    They rent 77 acres and have 26     
 acres of their own.They have 70 cows  
 and 20_30 sheep.They make mainly      
 silage and a little hay.              
    They grow swedes for fodder and    
 potatoes to sell.They don't employ    
 anyone else full-time but they do     
 have extra help for hedging and silage
 making.                               
     This farm must be kept as a dairy 
 farm and they pay Â£46 an acre per year
 in rent.                              </content>
