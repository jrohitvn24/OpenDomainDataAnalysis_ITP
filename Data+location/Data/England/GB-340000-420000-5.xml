    The information on this page is    
taken from an interview with Mr.Tom    
Fazakerly.                             
    Mr. Fazakerly visited school on the
9th July 1985 and brought with him old 
newspapers,a Register of Electors dated
1945, and a model of the old Banks     
Chapel.                                
    He worked for the Crossens River   
Drainage Board for 25 years. One of his
many duties was as the official mole   
catcher. As well as catching moles, he 
caught hares, rabbits, stoats, weasels,
and rats. The snares were checked twice
a day. He did not like catching hares  
because they cried like a baby.        
Rabbits that were caught were eaten.   
The rats were skinned and their pelts  
were made into fur coats.
