		<content>{Gardening}is a popular leisure        
 activity. Gardens of the newer houses 
 are landscaped and laid out for best  
 effect and easy maintenance, with     
 high-powered machines for cutting     
 large areas of lawn. There is usually 
 a patio for relaxing and outdoor      
 barbecues. A vegetable patch is often 
 omitted though some residents enjoy   
 growing and showing their own produce 
 at local shows.{Pony riding}is very   
 popular with the younger age-group.   
{Falconry and archery}are two unusual  
 hobbies taken up by individuals.      
{Cricket and football}enthusiasts can  
 join teams at Swainby, and amateur    
{motor-cyclists}practise in fields     
 around Whorlton Castle.{Darts}are     
 played at the Sutton Arms in Faceby.  
 Most homes have a colour television   
 set; some have a video recorder. A    
{mobile library}visits weekly.         </content>
