		<title>13BRITISH TIMKEN</title>
		<content>                                       
  The first part of British Timken was 
built in 1944 but over the years it has
expanded.British Timken is an American 
company and Duston is the H.Q.of Timken
Europe.                                
  The weighbridge weighs lorries that  
come in and out.It has been there for  
17 years and is now too small.They are 
building a new one soon.An average of  
15 lorries are weighed every day.The   
scales go up to 40 tonnes.             
  Inside the cubicle at the weighbridge
there are 3 kinds of form.When a lorry 
carries tubes a small form is filled in
and put in a box as proof of delivery. 
The others are for lorries which carry 
cage strip and for those carrying      
scrap.Most of the scrap goes to        
Birmingham.
