		<title>02Why Seaton Delaval?</title>
		<content> The{history}of Seaton Delaval can be  
 traced back to the Norman Conquest of 
 1066, when{Hamon de la Val}was given  
 land for his service to Duke William. 
 In 1719{Admiral George Delaval}bought 
 the Seaton Delaval estate and had a   
 hall designed by{Sir John Vanburgh.   
 The hall was completed in 1728. The { 
{Avenue Head,}which is now the centre  
 of the town, is so called because it  
 used to be the entrance to the drive  
 of Seaton Delaval Hall.               
 The{Delaval family}had an interesting 
 history. They thought that there was a
{curse}on the family. In 1711, Francis 
 Delaval, the nephew of Admiral George 
 Delaval, inherited Ford Castle in the 
 north of Northumberland. When Admiral 
 George Delaval died in 1723, the      
 estate of Seaton Delaval was left to  
 Francis, and at this point, the curse 
 came into effect.                     </content>
