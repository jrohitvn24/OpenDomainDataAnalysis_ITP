		<title>13Totton Police Station</title>
		<content> Yesterday I went to Totton Police     
 Station.A P.C. talked to us about     
 his work. He joined the force as a    
 cadet at 16 years old. It takes two   
 years to train a cadet. He has been at
 Totton for seven years. There are not 
 any very bad crimes in Totton. The    
 worst ones are burglaries. Sometimes  
 there are family upsets. He once      
 caught a thief stealing milk from a   
 dairy. It made him scared because he  
 was alone &amp; the other man was very    
 big. He enjoys his job &amp; chose it     
 because it is an outdoor job, very    
 interesting, &amp; each day is different. 
 We had our fingerprints taken, found  
 out what it is like being locked in a 
 cell &amp; sat in a magistrates chair.    
 We tried the police radio.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
