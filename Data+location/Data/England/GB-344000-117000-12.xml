		<title>12Popular Food and Drinks</title>
		<content>     We did a survey on which was      
 peoples' favourite food and drinks in 
 our school (age 4-11). The most       
 popular drink was fizzy ones          
 especially coke but in the middle ages
 (7-9) they like blackcurrent and      
 orange as well as coke. For breakfast 
 people like corflakes, frosties (sugar
 coated cornflakes), rice crispies and 
 cocopops (coco flavoured rice         
 crispies). Some 6 year olds liked     
 toast better than the cereal. For     
 dinner the younger ones (4-6) liked   
 fish and chips but it changed to roast
 as they got older.  Even the teachers 
 liked roast. There is no marked       
 preference in types of pudding but ice
 cream came slightly ahead and so did  
 apple crumble and apple pie.
