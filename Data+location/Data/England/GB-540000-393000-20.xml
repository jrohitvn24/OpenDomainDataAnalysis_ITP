		<content> THE MEDIEVAL COINS TOLD BY NEIL       
 APPLEBY WRITTEN BY HELEN WILLOWS.     
 ONE DAY TWO MEN CAME TO APPLEBY'S FARM
 .THEY WERE TREASURE HUNTERS.THEY      
 WANTED TO TAKE THEIR METAL DETECTORS  
 INTO OUR FIELD WHICH HAD JUST BEEN    
 PLOUGHED.MR.APPLEBY SAID YES.THE MEN  
 SAID IF WE FIND ANYTHING WE WILL GIVE 
 IT TO YOU.LATER ON THAT DAY THERE WAS 
 A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.IT WAS THE TWO MEN
 .THEY HAD TWO COINS.THE COINS WERE    
 FROM 1312.THEY WERE EDWARD III SILVER 
 GROATS.WE DO NOT KNOW IF THE COINS ARE
 VALUABLE OR NOT.WE FOUND THAT EDWARD  
 III SUCCESSFULLY REISSUED THE GROAT.  
 THE WAR SAW THE CULT OF CHIVALRY      
 BLOSSOM.THE ORDER OF THE GARTER       
 REMAINS.THIS WAS THE TIME WHEN WAR    
 WITH FRANCE TO RECOVER AQUIAINE WAS   
 WAGED WITH OUT PAUSE.THE LONG BOW WAS 
 THE DOMINANT WEAPON AT THIS TIME.
