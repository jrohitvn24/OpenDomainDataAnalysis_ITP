		<title>06MAJOR INDUSTRIES</title>
		<content> There are two major industries in this
 area. These are an agricultural feed  
 mill and a gravel pit.                
                                       
 The gravel from the pit is dug out and
 pushed into a lake of clean water and 
 then it is sucked out and put into    
 storage chambers. The washed gravel is
 then sold mainly as a building        
 material.                             
                                       
 The feed mill uses wheat,barley,fish  
 meal and minerals which are ground and
 mixed together to make animal food.   
 The food is made into pellets of      
 various sizes to suit different       
 animals. The feed mill has invented a 
 special mixture itself.The feed which 
 is produced is sold to many farmers in
 the district and further afield.
