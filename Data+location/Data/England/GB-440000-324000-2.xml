		<title>02Donington Hall</title>
		<content> Donington Hall was built in 1795 by   
 the 1st Marquis of Hastings of local  
 stone. It has changed hands many times
 since then and now belongs to British 
 Midland Airways, who acquired it for  
 use as their headquarters in 1980, the
 hall being situated close to the East 
 Midlands Airport.                     
 The external structure of the hall has
 been carefully restored to regain its 
 former elegance and internal          
 restoration is still in progress.     
 The parkland surrounding the hall     
 still contains some majestic oaks and 
 other forest trees.                   
 B.M.A. provides employment for many   
 people from the surrounding area,     
 transport to the hall being provided  
 by a Castle Donington based bus       
 company.
