		<content> I think that in Newcastle town centre,
the building that characterises modern 
building most is Fine Fare. I think    
this is because it stands out, more    
than any other building in the whole   
town centre as the way that buildings  
are built in 1985.                     
 It is a modern building, with colours 
painted all over it. Not colours that  
blend in with the town itself, but     
colours which make it stand out against
the rest of our little town. I don't   
think that this shop, (in one of many),
should have been built in Newcastle. It
is too much of a contrast towards our  
small plain town to look right. At     
least the outer side of the building   
could have been painted a more pastel  
shade, not a startling orange and green
like it is. I think that this is very  
thoughtless.
