		<title>05HEDGEROWS AND VERGES.</title>
		<content>   The hedgerows of this area are      
 mainly hawthorn, elder and hazel,     
 interspersed with dog-roses           
 intertwined with brambles.            
   At the end of June the hedgerows    
 were alive with thrushes, chaffinches,
 wrens and blackbirds whose nests, in  
 the dense undergrowth, were empty, the
 fledgelings having flown. The more    
 unusual yellowhammers and long-tailed 
 tits could also be seen.              
   Beneath the hedges there is         
 evidence of mice and voles, stoats and
 rabbits, while in one place an old,   
 disused badgers' sett may be seen.    
   The roadside verges are profuse with
 wild plants, the main ones being      
 mullein, chervil, garlic mustard and  
 vetches. Various types of grass       
 include onion couch, couch, bent,     
 brome and meadow-grasses.
