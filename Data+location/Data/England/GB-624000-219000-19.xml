		<title>19FISH FARMING - WALTON</title>
		<content> I go out fishing with my dad in his   
 boat 'True to the core' and we go     
 round the Naze towards the pier where 
 my dad's eel nets are. Then we go     
 quite close in and throw a small      
 grappling hook over the side to get   
 the eel nets. Next we pull them in and
 then we start up and go out a bit     
 deeper. Then my dad empties the eels  
 out and I put the eels in a big       
 container. Next I throw the crabs away
 and then we place the nets in the     
 water and go back to the river and put
 the eels in eel boxes and leave them  
 there until we take them home where we
 kill them and gut them before selling 
 them to the people on the sea front.
