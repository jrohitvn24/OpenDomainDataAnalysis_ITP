 The{Holywell Bay Old People's Home}was
 converted from a hotel in November    
 l984 to a home for old people.  There 
 are 30 residents including 2 married  
 couples, 3 sisters, 6 men and the     
 remainder women.  The oldest resident 
 is 93 and there is no one younger than
 70.  There are l4 staff.  Most        
 residents have moved to Holywell Bay  
 from their own homes, mostly in       
 Cornwall, the furthest coming from    
 Redruth about 20 miles away.  The     
 weekly rates are from Â£ll0 - Â£l50     
 depending on the accommodation        
 requirements of each person.  Because 
 prices vary there are no extra fees at
 all.  Individual needs such as        
 diabetic and vegetarian are also      
 catered for.
