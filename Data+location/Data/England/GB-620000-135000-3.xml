		<title>03 SUGAR LOAF HILL, FOLKESTONE</title>
		<content>   Sugar Loaf, a basin-shaped hill 200'
 high and 400' above sea level, is one 
of a range of hills behind Folkestone. 
   About 2000 B.C. it was a religious  
centre for the local tribes, and even  
today crosses are taken up to          
commemorate Easter.                    
   Passing travellers drew water from  
Holy Well. In 1905, a sheep dip was in 
use. Cows, which used to graze the     
hill, made the paths. In 1940, gun     
emplacements and tank traps were       
established to guard against invasion. 
Canadian soldiers camped here.         
   On July  2nd,1985, Class 6 of Park  
Farm School visited Sugar Loaf, passing
through crop fields. They had a        
splendid view of Folkestone and could  
see France. The hill was covered with  
flowers and grasses and they counted   
over 300 orchids.This amazing hill is  
still felt to be a very special place. </content>
