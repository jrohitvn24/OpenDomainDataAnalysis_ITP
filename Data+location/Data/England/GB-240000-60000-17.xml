		<content> Recollections of a Man of 76 years,   
 December 1963-One of the first        
 recollections is the blizzard of 1891,
 when the snow in the road from        
 Cargreen to Cross was level with the  
 tops of the hedges. Transport in those
 days and up to 1914 was by horse and  
 trap or four-wheeled carriages. Public
 transport was mainly on the river     
 where the old Saltash Steamboat Co.   
 ran a market steamer from Calstock to 
 North Corner, Devonport, three days a 
 week.The fare was one shilling return.
 The ferry was the next best way of    
 getting to Plymouth on days when the  
 steamers were not running, crossing   
 the river by boat and then across the 
 fields to Bere Ferrers station, and   
 going by train.Practically everything 
 in the way of goods were brought by   
 way of the River Tamar,even coal came 
 by two-masted schooner.               </content>
