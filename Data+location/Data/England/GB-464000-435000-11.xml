		<title>11 Building Whitemoor Mine</title>
		<content>One man's job had been as a shaft      
sinker during the mine's construction. 
The Project had taken five and a half  
years to complete, from January 1980 to
August 1985. He haded an 8 hour day, 7 
days a week whenever possible, even    
through holiday periods. Ten men worked
a shift in a 3 shift system, making a  
total of 60 me sinking shafts.         
Approximately 70 extra men were        
involved in tunnelling. His dislikes   
concerning the job included the  hard  
work, the dirt, the noise and the lack 
of canteen facilities. However, it was 
possible to earn in excess of 20,000   
pounds per annum during the project.   
There were hundreds of safety rules.   
The most obvious rules were that       
smoking was prohibited and wearing     
helmets, ear plugs and gloves was      
compulsory.
