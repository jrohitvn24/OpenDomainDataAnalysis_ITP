		<title>14Trade in the Bramley area.</title>
		<content>{ Major influences}on trade in Bramley 
 in the past 15 years were the{motorway
 (1km.away) and consequent urban growth
 with{new housing estates}and an{      
{Industrial Estate.}                   
  7 new housing estates caused village 
 businesses to prosper, from grocery,  
 bakers, fashion and DIY shops, to     
 betting offices, florists, a Building 
 Society, garages, and car maintenance.
  An Industrial Estate was opened      
 across the motorway and this brought  
 an influx of workers at lunch time.   
 This, combined with long-distance     
 traffic,has caused a{rise in the fast 
{food service.}There are now 9 places  
 which, between them, cater for people 
 between 7am and 11.30pm.              
  There is a Hypermarket opening in{Oct
{1985,}selling everything under 1 roof,
 and cheaper.How will this affect      
 village trade? Only time will tell.   </content>
