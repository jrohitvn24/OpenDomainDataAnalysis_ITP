 Hurriedly built mineworkers cottages  
 of c.1830 were demolished by stages in
 the 1960's.Afew late Georgian houses  
 remain,all well built and modernised. 
 Late Victorian and Edwardian terraces 
 are found in ribbon development and in
 blocks of streets near the main coll- 
 iery sites.In the 1930's an estate of 
 council houses was built in St.Helens.
 These are being refurbished now.Larger
 council housing estates have been     
 built in both villages between 1960   
 and 1980,and in West Auckland a priv- 
 ate housing development was completed 
 in the late 1960's.Council housing    
 forms over half of the residential    
 building in the villages:             
 St.Helens: 200 private,704 council.   
 W.Auckland:706 private,459 council.   
 The E.end of the block has Victorian  
 terraces and 1960's council houses.   </content>
