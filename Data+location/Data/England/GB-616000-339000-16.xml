		<content>  When Felbrigg Hall was built, the sea
 could be seen from the windows.  The  
{Great Wood}was planted to protect the 
 Hall from the cold northerly winds.   
  Almost half of the 526-hectare Estate
 is covered by woodland.  60% is{hard- 
{wood}(the main types of trees being   
 beech, oak and sweet chestnut), the   
 remainder are conifers.  The oldest   
 tree is a 130-year old chestnut.      
  Part of the wood is a{Site of Special
{Scientific Interest}because there are 
 rare{fungi}growing on the beech trees.
 The woodsmen are not allowed to inter-
 fere with the growth of that part, cut
 trees or take down fallen branches -  
 the area is left to the wildlife.     
  The leaves which fall in Autumn are  
 also left to rot, producing good soil 
 for the new saplings.
