		<content> Fifty years ago all the land was owned
 by the Church Commissioner's.  People 
 rented small pieces of land.  Hay and 
 corn was cut with a scythe then       
 reapers pulled by horses cut the rest.
 Three horses drew binders. Shire and  
 Clydesdale horses worked for two hours
 and then were fed and rested.  Sheaves
 were made into stooks. Then horses and
 carts took the corn to the stack yard 
 where it was thatched. After being put
 in stacks the corn was thershed.      
 Threshing machines travelled from farm
 to farm.                              
    Farms were mixed arable and stock  
 consisting of sheep, cattle and       
 horses. Large hedges divided fields.  
 Large fields might be 22 acres.       
 Fourteen people worked at manor farm  
 which was 350 acres.
