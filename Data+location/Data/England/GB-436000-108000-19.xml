		<title>19Marchwood Park House</title>
		<content>{Marchwood Park is a magnificent house}
 standing high up surrounded by a green
 park of 187 acres.It was built in     
 1826 on a hill because the owner,being
 an old naval man, liked to watch the  
 ships sailing up and down Southampton 
 Water.He was also responsible for     
 building the parish church and the    
 first school in Marchwood.            
     Until 1935 it was occupied by     
 several owners.After the 2nd World War
 it became a home for airman who were  
 recovering from burns received while  
 flying bombers and fighters.For a few 
 years it was used as a language       
 school.It has now been bought by a    
 large American company who plan to use
 it as a private hospital.It is hoped  
 that this will provide extra jobs for 
 people in the Marchwood area.
