 in the area. Opened in 1911, it became
 a comprehensive school in 1965 and at 
 its peak in the mid 1970's had about  
 2400 pupils aged 11 to 18 and was one 
 of the{biggest schools in the         
{country}.With the opening of a second 
 comprehensive school, Coombe Dean, in 
 the area, numbers have now declined to
 1400. All pupils, including 6th

 and the school now has 34{computers   
 which are constantly in use. The      
 extensive grounds are used for a wide 
 range of sporting activities although

 housing development. The school has
