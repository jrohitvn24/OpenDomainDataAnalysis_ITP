		<content> WE DID A SURVEY ABOUT RECREATION AND  
ASKED MANY PEOPLE OF ALL AGES TO FILL  
IN A QUESTIONAIRRE SO WE COULD FIND    
OUT WHAT THEY DO IN THEIR SPARE TIME.  
WE FOUND THAT ON OUR ESTATE OVER 50%   
OF THOSE ASKED HAVE MORE THAN 15 HOURS 
OF SPARE TIME A WEEK.                  
IT SEEMS THAT MOST OF THIS SPARE TIME  
IS SPENT AT HOME AND THE MOST POPULAR  
PASTTIME IS WATCHING T.V.THE AVERAGE   
TIME SPENT ON T.V. EACH NIGHT IS 3-5   
HOURS.MANY PEOPLE INTERVIEWED HAVE HOBB
ES SUCH AS READING,KNITTING,SEWING     
GARDENING AND COOKING                  
  IT APPEARS THAT ONLY10% OF THOSE     
INTERVIEWED HAVE JOINED A CLUB IN WHICH
TO SPEND THERE FREE TIME.
