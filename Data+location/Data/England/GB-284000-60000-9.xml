		<title>09Camp Sites - Paignton</title>
		<content> The Orchard Camp Site is also on the  
 Totnes to Paignton Road. It covers    
 some 25 acres.                        
 Approximately 5000 people use the site
 in any one season. A site foreman is  
 responsible for the day to day running
 of the site.                          
 The main house on the site goes back  
 to 1363 but in 1936 it was virtually  
 derelict and was due to be totally    
 cleared. However it was restored and  
 became a camp site with a lot of      
 foreign visitors using the site.      
 There are sixty eight caravans on the 
 site and again the family rule        
 applies.                              
 Originally the main house was the     
 Manor House and the horses would pull 
 carriages down the main drive.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
