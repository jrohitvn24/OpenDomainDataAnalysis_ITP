		<title>12A Postman's Day</title>
		<content> At 4am I get up and walk to work      
 because the mail arrives at the Post  
 Office at 4.30am.                     
 The bags are emptied and the letters  
 are separated from the packets. The   
 letters are then hand sorted into all 
 the different deliveries.             
 Vans arrive at the Post Office from   
 the Parcel Office and I get a lift to 
 the start of my delivery. Each        
 delivery has between four and six     
 hundred houses to call at.            
 I start my delivery at about 7am      
 finishing between 9.00 and 9.30am.    
 When I finish I catch the bus back to 
 the Post Office and have my meal      
 break.                                
 After this I prepare and then go out  
 on my second delivery. There are only 
 about 10% of the first delivery       
 letters and packets. After the second 
 delivery I go straight home.          </content>
