		<title>12INTERVIEW WITH MRS SARNEY</title>
		<content> Mrs Sarney's father was interested in 
 local history.He first wrote articles 
 for the Church Parish Magazine.People 
 said he ought to put them together as 
 a book so he did-50 years ago.Since   
 then Sunningdale has tripled in size. 
 Mrs Sarney has lived in Sunningdale   
 all her life and has lived in the same
 house-Pennington for all that time.She
 was the youngest of 9 children living 
 at Pennington(originally a Post Office
 ).Her family stayed here during the   
 war but she went away for 3 years .   
 Several bombs were dropped on the     
 village.One was dropped outside a     
 house called Dale Lodge and one came  
 down behind the Church-it survived!In 
 order to write the book Mr Hodder     
 looked up many sources,including old  
 documents,books and newspapers.One of 
 the books was called 'The Forest of   
 Sunninghill'one of only 400 printed.  </content>
