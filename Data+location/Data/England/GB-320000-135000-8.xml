		<content>  Hawkridge Reservior situated in the  
 foothills of the Quantocks is under   
 the control of the Wessex Water       
 Authority. Its primary function is to 
 supply water via Ashford Water        
 Treatment Works to the consumers of   
 Bridgwater and surrounding district.  
   Construction of the reservoir was   
 completed in 1964 and it covers a     
 flooded area of 35 acres. The19.8metre
 high mass gravity concrete Dam        
 impounds a maximum of 190 million     
 gallons of water which is collected   
 from gathering grounds of 2,690 acres 
 and fed to the reservoir via the      
 Merridge and Aisholt streams.         
     The reservoir also attracts large 
 numbers of sightseers during the      
 summer period especially at weekends. 
   A  sailing club with about 60       
 members uses the reservoir.  They also
 have 10 sailing board members.        </content>
