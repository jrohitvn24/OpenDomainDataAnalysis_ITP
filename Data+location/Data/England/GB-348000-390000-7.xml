 Julie Ablett's mother works in the    
 office at Treetops, an old peoples'   
 home where there are about 78         
 full-time residents.Each pays about   
 Â£128 a week to stay there. They are   
 looked after by trained staff who deal
 with their personal and every day     
 problems.                             
                                       
 The Home has 2 acres of landscaped    
 gardens where the inmates can sit and 
 watch the local wild life. There are  
 three separate houses where they live-
 "Thretops", "Borrowdale" and "The     
 Bungalow".                            
                                       
 Recent comment argues that the old are
 neglected by their families. This may 
 be untrue, but nationally, the old die
 of cold every winter and are often    
 very lonely.                          </content>
