		<content>{Law and order} includes the courts,   
the Police Station and Probation       
Office. The two {courts} are the       
Magistrate's court and Crown court.    
Sometimes in the Magistrate's court    
matters are too difficult to deal      
with, so the case is sent onto the     
Crown court. The {Police station}      
covers all these places; Aylesbury,    
Aston Clinton, Waddeson, Wendover,     
Wing, Stewkley, Cheddington and        
Ivanhoe. The Police station takes care 
of lost property. The Police work 8    
hours a day. The Aylesbury {Prison} is 
now a Youth Custody Centre.There are   
297 prisoners in the prison.Their wages
are 1.22 pounds a week.                
The probation officer is more like a   
Social worker, she uses a dictaphone to
speak into for her secretary.
