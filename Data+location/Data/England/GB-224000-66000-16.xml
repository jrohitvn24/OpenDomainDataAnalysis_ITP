		<title>16Trenouth and Chaple Farms.</title>
		<content>   Trenouth Farm dates back to 1785 and
 the present owner  has lived there for
 28 years with his family. The farmer  
 has 72 acres of land which is mostly  
 pasture. There are a lot of animals,  
 including 3 dairy cows, 78 bullocks,  
 60 pigs and  16 chickens. The farmer  
 has 3 tractors, 1 muckspreader, a     
 bailer, a hayturner, grass cutter and 
 a sileage cutter. We thought the farm 
 was a bit smelly because he had so    
 many pigs.                            
                                       
        Chaple Farm.                   
   Chaple Farm has 42 acres of pasture 
 and the farmer ploughs a field every  
 year for kale. He has 15 S.Devon cows 
 for dairy and beef, and 18 chickens.  
 It is called Chaple Farm because the  
 old ruined Chapel of Rosecraddoc      
 Manor was situated on the farms land.
