		<title>07Cotswold Shepherd's Bothy</title>
		<content> Along the ancient track at Kineton    
 Hill are several old buildings, one of
 which is to be preserved as it is a   
 complete shepherd's bothy. It was a   
 little house where the shepherds      
 rested their flocks on the way to and 
 from Stow on the Wold sheep fairs. It 
 is in the back wall of a complete     
 stone-walled yard where the sheep were
 penned. It has a round pot chimney    
 inside and very old plaster containing
 cow hair on the walls, and in the     
 torching in the roof.                 
 There is also a cottage building at   
 Kineton Hill farm which is notable for
 having dry stone walls without lime   
 dust mortar to hold the stones        
 together. This is probably over 300   
 years old.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
