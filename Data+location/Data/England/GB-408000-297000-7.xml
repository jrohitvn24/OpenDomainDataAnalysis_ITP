		<content> Today we went to the biggest garden in
 our area.We wallked there and we had  
 to cross over two very busy roads,    
 Walsall Road and Rosemary Hill Road.We
 took our own chip boards to write on. 
 When we got to the right house in Park
 Drive we went to see the garden. It   
 was almost ten times bigger than yours
 or mine. It was nearly 35 acres, but  
 bit by bit the garden got smaller and 
 it is now 7 acres. A man had to go    
 around with us in case we got lost.   
 They had a tractor type of lawn mower 
 with blades three metress wide. The   
 grass there was partly an unusual     
 grass called camomile. They had a pond
 which used to be part of a big        
 swimming pool. A lot of trees in the  
 garden did not grow from a little     
 seed, they were brought from America. 
 There were many pink. purple and dark 
 rhododendrons in the garden.          </content>
