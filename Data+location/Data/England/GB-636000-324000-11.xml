 Middle,pupils take Diagnostic tests:

 Research,Standardised tests in non-   
 verbal reasoning,English Progress,    
 Maths Attainment and Reading.         
 3 children come to school by taxi,the 
 others all travel from Brumstead and  
 within Stalham under their own        
 arrangements.They do not have any home
 work only a little number or reading  
 work.                                 
 They are taken on school trips,but    
 only if they are beneficial and       
 educational.                          
 The school does a lot of fund-raising.
 Last year,Â£1000 was raised by the     
 saving of waste paper.This went to the
 National Children's Homes.            
 The children enjoy attending and look 
 forward to their Middle School        
 transfer and more facilities.         </content>
