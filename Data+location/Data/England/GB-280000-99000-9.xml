		<title>09The Parish Church</title>
		<content>   The main feature of Crediton is the 
 Parish Church. A{Saxon}church was     
 built in{739}but by the{15th Century  
 it was falling down and had to be     
 replaced by the{gothic-style}church we
 have now. This also had to be{restored
 in the{19th Century.                  
   Part of the church known as the{Lady
{Chapel}was the{boys' grammar school   
{from 1547 to 1860.}If you visit the   
 church you will see how beautiful it  
 is. You will also see the wonderful   
{stained-glass windows.}There is also a
 small{museum}which shows charters and 
 the history of the church.            
   It is said that{Oliver Cromwell     
 attended divine service at the church 
 with{General Fairfax}after receiving  
 their troops in October 1645.         
   A{memorial}to{Sir Redvers buller    
 stands high above the nave altar.
