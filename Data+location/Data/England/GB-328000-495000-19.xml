		<title>19Brantwood, near Coniston</title>
		<content> This fine house, on the E shore of    
 Coniston Water, became the home of    
{John Ruskin}in 1872. Ruskin was an    
 artist, art critic and patron of the  
 arts. He had visited Coniston in the  
 1820's, and when Brantwood was offered
 for sale, Ruskin bought it for Â£1500. 
 The house was in poor condition, so   
 Ruskin began repairs and additions    
 before moving in. Up to Ruskin's death
 in 1900 the{Brantwood Estate}grew from
 6.5 hectares to 200 hectares, and was 
 administered after his death by the   
{Severn family.}After a period of      
 decline, the building was opened to   
 the public in 1934. Many of Ruskin's  
 own drawings and paintings are on     
 view, along with his furniture and    
 artefacts. Under a vigorous and       
 imaginative managership, Brantwood is 
 heading into a{promising future}as a  
 living centre of the arts.            </content>
