		<title>17URCHFONT VILLAGE POND</title>
		<content> URCHFONT IS ONE OF THE FEW VILLAGES TO
 STILL HAVE A POND. IT BACKS ONTO A    
 FARMYARD WALL AND HAS GRASS ON THREE  
 SIDES. I IS ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
 AND WAS ORIGINALLY KEPT FILLED BY     
 WATER  THROWN FROM THE FARM AFTER     
 COOLING THE MILK FROM THE COWS, NOW IT
 IS PURELY SURFACE WATER WITH          
 OCCASIONAL WATER PUMPED IN FROM THE   
 FARM BOREHOLE IN DRY WEATHER. A LOCAL 
 RESIDENT HAS TAKEN IT UPON HIMSELFTO  
 LOOK AFTER THE DUCKS WHICH HAVE       
 SETTLED THERE, ABOUT A HUNDRED        
 MALLARDS AND HALF A DOZEN CROSS       
 BREEDS. HE AND OTHER VOLUNTEERS CUT   
 THE GRASS AND KEEP THE AREA CLEAN AND 
 TIDY WHICH HELPED URCHFONT TO WIN THE 
 BEST KEPT VILLAGE COMPETITION. ONCE IT
 WAS NEARLY FILLED IN TO MAKE A CAR    
 PARK FOR THE CHURCH, BUT FORTUNATELY  
 THE POND WON.                         
                                       </content>
