		<content>      Most people have their own cars  
 which seems almost a necessity. This  
 leaves children, the elderly, the     
 disabled, and wives in need of the bus
 service. This is run by private       
 operators and subsidised by the county
 council.                              
      We have two school buses a day,  
 to Corsham and to Chippenham, also    
 available to the general public.      
      There are buses for shopping.    
 One goes to Corsham on Tuesday am     
 One goes to Chippenham on Friday am   
 One goes to Corsham On Saturday am    
      A regular service between Bath &amp; 
 Chippenham runs through Corsham.      
      Two operators run a daily service
 to London with a stop at Pickwick.    
      Fast trains run from Chippenham  
 to London,Swindon,Bristol.            
      Many young people use mopeds or  
 bicycles and they hitch-hike to Bath. </content>
