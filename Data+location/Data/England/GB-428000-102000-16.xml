		<content> The residents of the village were then
 asked to highlight some of the points 
 of social concern to residents.       
{21}families felt the need for a       
{Recreation Centre}in the village and  
 were glad to see that the tertiary    
 college is to expand the use of its   
 facilities.                           
{9}families would like to see a        
 permanent library to replace the      
 existing mobile library van.          
 Several other suggestions were made,  
 including:-{Benches,Car Parks,Roller  
{Disco, Zebra                          
{Crossings,Theatre,Cinema,Coffee       
{Shop,Information Centre,Ice           
{Rink,Tennis Courts,Street Cleaner}etc 
 but none received overwhelming support
 from those interviewed.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
