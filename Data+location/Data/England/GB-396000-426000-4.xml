		<title>04The Rochdale Canal</title>
		<content> The canal locks have been reopened to 
 let the barges pass once again. A     
{canal}was built in Manchester in      
 1761. Barges could travel along the   
 Rivers Aire &amp; Calder in Yorkshire     
 almost as far as Sowerby Bridge, so   
 they could nearly travel from Hull to 
 Liverpool. A meeting was held in      
 Hebden Bridge to consider building a  
 canal to join the 33 miles from       
 Sowerby Bridge to Manchester. Â£200000 
 was raised but not everyone wanted a  
 canal and Parliament said             
 no. However,those who wanted a canal  
 asked Wm.Jessop to survey the route.  
 In April 1794 permission was given to 
 build it.                             
 By August 1798 the canal was opened   
 from Sowerby Bridge to Todmorden and  
 finally completed by 1802. It had 92  
 locks and was used by barges up to    
 74 feet long and 14 feet wide.        </content>
