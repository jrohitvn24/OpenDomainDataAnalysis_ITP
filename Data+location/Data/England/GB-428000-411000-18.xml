		<content> The mine was started in 1869.         
 Now there are three shafts, and three 
 seams are producing coal from five    
 faces. In the past workers had to     
 travel up to 4800 metres from the     
 shaft to the coal face, but now the   
 furthest they go is 3700 metres. The  
 seams are called Lidgett, Fenton, and 
 Thorncliffe. Lidgett seam is only 0.90
 metres thick.                         
 When the mine was nationalised in 1947
 2400 men produced 650000 tons of coal.
 In 1969 one million tons of coal was  
 produced by only 1900 men because     
 machinery and conveyor belts were     
 installed. Now only 1340 men are      
 employed. Almost all the coal goes for
 the production of electricity (65%) or
 coke (25%).
