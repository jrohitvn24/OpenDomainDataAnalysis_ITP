		<title>10THORPE'S PLAYING FIELD</title>
		<content>  FOR MANY YEARS PEOPLE HERE HAVE      
 WANTED                                
 A PLAYING FIELD FOR THE CHILDREN OF   
 THE VILLAGE. NOW AT LAST WE HAVE ONE  
 AND BY THE END OF THE YEAR IT SHOULD  
 BE COMPLETED. THE FIELD IS BEHIND THE 
 SOCIAL CLUB ON LAND BELONGING TO      
 THORPE HALL BUT SOON THERE WILL BE A  
 NEW ENTRANCE TO IT OPPOSITE OAK CLOSE 
 IN FRINTON ROAD. THE PARISH COUNCIL   
 HAVE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THE FARMER     
 HARVESTED HIS CROPS ON THE LAND WHERE 
 THE ENTRANCE IS TO BE. THE FIELD WILL 
 BE EASIER TO GET TO ONCE THE ROAD IS  
 BUILT. THERE IS GOING TO BE  A        
 FOOTBALL PITCH AND PRACTICE AREA,     
 HOOPS, CLIMBING FRAME, A SAND PIT,    
 TREES TO CLIMB AND LOTS OF OTHER      
 THINGS AS WELL. THERE WILL BE A CAR   
 PARKING AREA, AND A NEW SCOUT HUT ON  
 THE SITE. IT WILL NOT COST A THING TO 
 PLAY ON THE FIELD.                    </content>
