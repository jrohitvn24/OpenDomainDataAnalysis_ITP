		<content> The Tumuli near our school are on the 
 land owned by Boconnoc Estate and are 
 in the district of Caradon and the    
 Parish of Braddock.                   
 The land is used for grazing,crops and
 some is scrub.                        
 The Tumuli were built in the Bronze   
 Age.The height of the Tumuli varies   
 from 2 _ 25 feet.The diameter varies  
 from 25 _ 110 yards.                  
 Some of the Tumuli is covered with    
 gorse bushes and some with long grass.
 The Tumuli have sometimes got quartz  
 stones on the sides.                  
 The Tumuli are protected by the Dept. 
 of the Environment and cannot be      
 knocked down by the farmers.          
 Some of the Tumuli have flat tops     
 instead of rounded ones and some      
 people say they were opened up in the 
 Civil War and more dead bodies were   
 put in.                               </content>
