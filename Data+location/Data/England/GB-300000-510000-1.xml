		<title>01EGREMONT AREA TITLE PAGE</title>
		<content> Egremont is three miles from the Irish
 sea and covers the S.W. 4KM. The      
 river Ehen runs down the Ehen valley  
 ,from Ennerdale lake, through Egremont
 and finishes at sellafield. The N.E.  
 corner is the start of the Lakeland   
 fells, with Dent fell riseing from    
 150-1131 feet. The bottom S.E.&amp; S     
 squares contain the working iron ore  
 mine. Iron ore has been mined for     
 800yrs from 9 mines in the area.      
 Egremont was built up around the 12th 
 centuary castle. The castle was built 
 by William Demeschines. In 1267       
 Henry 3rd granted a charter allowing  
 Egremont 1 weekly market and 1 three  
 day fair.                             
 Egremont contains 6 industries        
 manufacturing different products.     
 It has expanded to accomodate the     
 Sellafield power plant and as a       
 consequence a new by-pass is planned. </content>
