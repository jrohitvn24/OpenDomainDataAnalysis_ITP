		<content> There is four and a half kilometres of
 motorway going through our area.It is 
 a three lane motorway which goes in   
 each direction.It goes across the clay
 vale from east to west.There are no   
 junctions along our stretch of        
 motorway but the east Swindon         
 junction is only three kilometres away
 and the west Swindon junction is only 
 one and a half kilometres away.It was 
 built to provide fast easy transport. 
 It actually separates Swindon from    
 Wroughton. The main road that joins   
 Wroughton to Swindon the A361 passes  
 over the M4 motorway.                 
 The M4 motorway is very busy even in  
 the mid-afternoon.In 5 minutes over 50
 cars go under the A361 Wroughton to   
 Swindon road in each direction.
