		<title>09Wooler-Wishing or Pin Well</title>
		<content> South of Wooler on the road to Earle  
 is Horsdon Hill where the annual      
 cattle and sheep fair used to held. At
 its foot is the Pin Well.On May Day a 
 procession of people used to march    
 from Wooler to the well and each      
 person would drop a crooked pin into  
 it and made a wish.                   
   Overhanging the well is a rock      
 called the King's Chair.Legend has it 
 that a king sat on the rock and       
 directed a legendary battle on the    
 plain below.This area of land is      
 called the Kettles and has given its  
 name to a prehistoric camp which is on
 the top of the hill.
