		<content>    Interior - on the south wall is a  
 piscina which is possibly from the    
 12th century. Another interesting     
 feature is the remnant of the         
 stairway to the rood screen loft,     
 which is probably where the war       
 memorial now stands. Without doubt,   
 the most interesting object in the    
 church is the font, which was probably
 made in the 12th century of Caen stone
 from Normandy. The font has iron      
 staple marks on top where locks were  
 used to stop holy water being stolen  
 and used for black magic. There is a  
 modern stained-glass window in memory 
 of Sir Airey Neave, which has its own 
 entry on Page 4.                      
    Exterior - the largest memorial in 
 the churchyard is the Disney tomb,    
 which contains eight members of the   
 family that settled here from         
 Lincolnshire in the 19th century.     </content>
