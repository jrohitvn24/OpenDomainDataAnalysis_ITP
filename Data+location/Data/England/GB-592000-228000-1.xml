		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF FORDHAM AREA</title>
		<content> Our area is rural with undulating     
 countryside. Most of the people live  
 in the small village of Fordham.In the
 village there is an interesting old   
 church, part of which dates back to   
 the 9th century.The housing is a      
 mixture of old and new with some      
 unusual beamed and thatched           
 properties.                           
     There are two public houses       
 serving snacks and meals.Also two     
 shops, a Post Office (general stores),
 and a butcher's. Behind the village   
 hall, built after the first world war,
 there is a children's playing field.  
          Surrounding the village are  
 large open fields, mainly arable land,
 although some animals are kept.       
 Pleasant walks through footpaths are  
 available in this area. In the        
 distance you can see the ancient town 
 of Colchester                         </content>
