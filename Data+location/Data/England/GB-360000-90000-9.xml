		<content> 20/30 acres in a day.The wheat is     
 grown for flour,the barley for feeding
 cattle and making beer and the oats   
 for porridge and feeding the animals. 
 Grass is grown for hay and silage.Hay 
 is dried grass.Silage is wet grass put
 in a pit after it is rolled by tractor
 so that no air is in it.Inwinter it is
 fed to the animals.9tons of silage per
 cow-70 kilos per sheep.               
             Sheep and beef cows are   
 kept on the hilly land. There are     
 1,400 sheep who have approximately 2  
 lambs a year.They are sheared once a  
 year by shearers who come from New    
 Zealand.                              
         The soil is a mixture of clay,
 sand and chalk.The climate tends to be
 rainy which is good for growing       
 grass.There are 20 tractors on the    
 farm(each using up to 30 gallons of   
 petrol a day) and 4 sheep dogs.       </content>
