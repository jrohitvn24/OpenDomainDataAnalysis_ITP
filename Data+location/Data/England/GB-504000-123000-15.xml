		<content> We have a toad and two slow worms in  
 the garden. The toad hops around. I   
 saw a hedgehog in the middle of the   
 road. It was rolled up in a ball. It  
 was all prickly. When I ws going home 
 on the bus I saw a fox-cub run across 
 the road. It stopped in the middle of 
 the road when the bus went past. The  
 bus just about missed it. I saw a grey
 squirrel running up a tree. It leapt  
 from branch to branch. Then it held an
 acorn in its frail paws. I have seen  
 badgers near our garden - sometimes   
 they bring their cubs. Before I go to 
 school I sometimes see some deer.     
 They are roe deer. There are lots of  
 rabbits around. They come out to play 
 and they nibble the grass. Our cat    
 brings dead moles to us.
