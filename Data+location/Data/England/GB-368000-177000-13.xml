		<title>13PUBLIC OPINION</title>
		<content>   Local councillors,governors of our  
 school,tell of the several projects   
 they get involved with and local      
 public opinion.                       
   -People in Westerleigh are worried  
 about the{busy traffic}and would like 
 to see a stricter speed limit imposed.
   -There is a{lack of cheaper housing 
 and young people tend to move out of  
 the area when they get married.       
   -Local people support the churches  
 and a{council grant}of Â£10,000 was    
 given to renovate the roof of         
 St.Peter's, Wapley.                   
   -Against public opinion,Westerleigh 
{village school closed}recently. The   
 silly thing is that some new houses   
 are now being built and numbers of    
 children may increase again.The old   
 schoolhouse has been bought privately 
 and is being turned into a nursery    
 school.                               </content>
