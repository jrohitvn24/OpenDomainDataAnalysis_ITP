		<title>12Landscape AND Buildings</title>
		<content> The{Olveston}church has no spire      
 because it was struck down by         
 lightning in 1604. The landscape of   
 our block is generally flat and there 
 is not very many buildings. It is     
 quite a desolate area with not many   
 houses and mainly farmland. A lot of  
 the{Elm}trees have been chopped down  
 because they had caught{Dutch-Elm}    
 diseases. There are not very many new 
 houses in Olveston.
