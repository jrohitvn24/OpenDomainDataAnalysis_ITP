		<title>10VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content> We like living in Bere Regis because  
 it is in the county-side with plenty  
 of wild-life and fresh air with no    
 town smells. There is fresh food ,    
 fruit,milk and vegetables. There are  
 clubs and most of the amenities and   
 it is a friendly place.There is not a 
 lot of heavy traffic and it is a good 
 place to play, with places to walk    
 dogs ride ponies and climb trees. Most
 children have Grandparents or aunties 
 near. There is a good choice of       
 houses, modern, council and old,      
 thatched ones.What we dont like is    
 that there are not enough shops or    
 buses or work for our Dads. Some have 
 to go a long way every day and get    
 stuck in traffic jams and get home    
 late.We would like more fetes. Most of
 us would not like to move.Some would  
 prefer a town if their friends could  
 come too.                             </content>
