		<title>09Games We Play in Kimpton</title>
		<content>  The games that we play form three    
 groups :indoor games,including board  
 and computer games;organised sports,  
 which we learn at school and in the   
 village, and play_ ground games.      
  Here are the rules for some of the   
 games which we have invented:         
 The aim of RED ROVERS is to capture   
 members of an opposing team after     
 selecting one by name in a chant:"Red 
 Rovers,Red Rovers,send (name) over."  
 VAMPIRE BAT:is our variation of catch 
 and release, using the lines painted  
 on the play_ground.As we chase we have
 to stay on the lines.                 
 In WALL BALL : a line of players takes
 it in turn to kick a ball once at a   
 wall.If he misses the wall or touches 
 the ball twice he is out.The remaining
 player wins.                          
  We believe that these games may be   
 played elsewhere under different names</content>
