		<title>18Ecology-The Beach.</title>
		<content>    We made a class visit to the local 
beach and divided the beach into three 
main areas.Firstly, the upper section  
above the high tide line a middle      
section and a third lower section.At   
the top of the beach are quite high    
sandy cliffs which are full of fossils,
it is quite easy to find a few sharks  
teeth and other fossils.Like most      
beaches in the south of England there  
is a lot of rubbish left by the tide.We
found the usual collection of rubbish  
from passing ships plus plastic        
bottles,old shoes,tyres,fishing tackles
bits etc.etc.                          
    The middle section contained a     
little seaweed,mostly bladderwrack,and 
evidence of cockles under the surface  
of the mud.There were a number of      
shells mostly cockles and scallop      
shells but also razor shells,          
winkles,mussels and oysters.           </content>
