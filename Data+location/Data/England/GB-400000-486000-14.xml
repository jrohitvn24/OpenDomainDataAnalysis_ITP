		<title>14THE SHOPKEEPER, THORALBY</title>
		<content> Our local shop-keeper and her husband 
 have owned the shop for 24 years. The 
 shop sells groceries, fruit,          
 vegetables, household goods and       
 newspapers. It is also the local Post 
 Office. Bread, sugar, tea, flour and  
 margarine are the most common items   
 sold. "Radio Times" &amp; "Woman's Own"   
 are the most popular magazines.       
 Customers come from the surrounding   
 farms and villages and they deliver   
 orders to people who ask for one. The 
 shop has a deep freeze for ice-cream  
 and frozen foods. Children buy sweets 
 on their way home from school. The    
 shop-keeper's husband runs a school   
 taxi service for local children.      
 The shop was previously owned by the  
 husband's family. Deliveries come from
 big towns like Darlington and Bishop  
 Auckland and once a week they go to   
 the Cash and Carry warehouse.         </content>
