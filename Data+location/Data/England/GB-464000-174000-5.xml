		<title>05MAPLEDURHAM WATERMILL</title>
		<content> Mapledurham Watermill is situated in  
 an area of outstanding natural beauty 
 near the Elizabethan Mapledurham      
 House.                                
      It stands on the site of the     
 original mill mentioned in the        
 Domesday Book.The walls and some      
 timbers of the 15th century mill can  
 be seen in the framework of the       
 present one.                          
      It is the last working  corn and 
 grist mill on the Thames.Wheat grown  
 on Mapledurham farms is ground by the 
 old millstones using the ancient      
 wooden machinery turned by an         
 undershot waterwheel.The wholemeal    
 flour is sold to shops and local      
 bakeries.Part of the film "The Eagle  
 Has Landed" was shot here and the fee 
 used to repair and replace machinery  
 since the mill had fallen into disuse 
 after the second war.                 </content>
