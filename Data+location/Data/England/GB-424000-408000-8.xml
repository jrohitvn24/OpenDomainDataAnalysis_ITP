		<content> Children went round singing and       
 scrubbing doorsteps for a penny and   
 twopence.Coal was moved about on      
 barges and if they could not afford it
 they went down to see if any had been 
 dropped.They used a bucket with holes 
 in on the end of a pole to fish coal  
 out of the canal.If they got more than
 they needed they would try to sell the
 rest for Â£0.02 per bucket.            
   people did not travel very much.Only
 the rich had cars.most people         
 travelled by trams or horse and cart. 
 Goods such as coal were moved by horse
 pulling barges on the canals.
