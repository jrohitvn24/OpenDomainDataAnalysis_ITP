		<content> THE GREAT YARMOUTH AND CAISTER GOLF   
 CLUB- 'THE OLDEST MEMBER'.            
                                       
  We interviwed 94 years-old Mr. Arthur
 England, who started playing 45 years 
 ago,when he finished playing cricket  
 and tennis. The membership and joining
 fees were then each Â£4(now Â£150+green 
 fees)."There were lots of bushes on   
 the course,but they had to be         
 destroyed to get to the rabbits which 
 had become diseased. The pavillion had
 been improved, especially the lounge  
 and lockers(now 142).The course is    
 never easy, but it is less difficult!"
  He won the Dredge cup for over 65's 3
 times,but when the age was reduced to 
 50, he refused to enter-"He did not   
 want to play with boys!."             
   He said that more people played now 
 than when he first started.
