		<title>04Village life in Ousden</title>
		<content> The people of Ousden have a certain   
 affection for their small village, and
 many expressed a hope that they would 
 remain there always. There is a       
 general feeling of satisfaction and   
 contentment with village life, the    
 people enjoying their homes, gardens, 
 children and their several pets. Most 
 join in the village activities to some
 degree. Owing to the small size of the
 community these are somewhat limited  
 and it is necessary for the people to 
 travel to the larger villages and     
 towns for entertainment and services, 
 these include playgroups, youth clubs 
 and day club for the elderly. There is
 a Womens Institute but it is only     
 supported by a few. The Community     
 Council is elected by the members and 
 the Committee is responsible for some 
 modest events. Some residents wish    
 there was more of a social life.      </content>
