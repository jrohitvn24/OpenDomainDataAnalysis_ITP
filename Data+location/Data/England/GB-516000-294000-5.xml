		<title>05Fletton land reclamation  1</title>
		<content>   The Land Reclamation Centre         
 (L.R.C.) is to be found just off the A
 15.  In a convenient programme of     
 cooperation with the London Brick     
 Company the L.R.C. deals with the     
 problem of getting rid of the ash, an 
 unwanted by-product, which is left    
 over during the process of producing  
 electricity from coal at the power    
 stations of Drakelow, Ratcliffe and   
 West Burton.  The Central Electrity   
 generating board, who entirely run the
 L.R.C. in our area, organise the ash  
 disposal system in the followimg way:_
   The L.B.C have for many years been  
 digging pits in our area to excavate  
 the Oxford clay which is used to      
 manufacture bricks.   When a pit has  
 been exhausted it is then loaned to   
 the C.E.G.B so that it can be         
 re-filled, using the ash from the     
 power stations.                       </content>
