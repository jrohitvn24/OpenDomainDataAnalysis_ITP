		<content> In{William the Conqueror's 1086       
{Domesday Survey}the land of{Hockliffe}
 was mainly an{arable}area with pasture
 lying along side the numerous streams.
 Early{14th century}records also show a
 great predominance of{arable}over     
 meadow or permanent pasture.  This    
 picture of mainly an{arable}landscape 
 continued in all for nearly{six       
{hundred years.}                       
 A change came in the early{17th       
{century}when the area was turned over 
 almost entirely to{pasture}as grazing 
 land for{cattle.}                     
 By the middle of the{20th century}the 
 picture had changed again as many of  
 the fields were given over to{arable  
{farming. }This trend appears to be    
 continuing in the{1980s.}The effects  
 of these recent agricultural changes  
 have been to destroy much{Medieval    
{ridge and furrow landscape.}          </content>
