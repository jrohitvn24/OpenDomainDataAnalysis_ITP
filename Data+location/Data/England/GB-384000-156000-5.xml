		<content> The fashions today are very much      
 influenced by Pop Stars and           
 celebrities. Some girls go around with
 very dark make-up on and they have    
 their ears pierced many times. Punks  
 are very untidy and chains, pins and  
 keys are used to decorate their       
 clothes and are worn as jewellery.    
 Some Punks wear weird chains and      
 earrings. Fish net tights are tights  
 with a pattern of holes in them. Punks
 have spiked hair which is dyed into   
 different colours.
