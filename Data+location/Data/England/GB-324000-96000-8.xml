		<content>{THE NEW VILLAGE HALL.                 
 The newest building is the new village
 hall, which is under construction.    
 For several years there have been     
 fund-raising events organised in the  
 village and, after much hard work and 
 effort, the building commenced this   
 year.   The hall will open in October 
 and be much larger than the old       
 hall.   It is being built of bricks,  
 with rosy-coloured windows all around 
 the top. The cost is 87000 pounds.    
{Opinions }vary; the comments made to  
 us included: too big, waste of money, 
 super, good, the best, too modern,    
 better than the old one, looks good,  
 ugly. (You never can please everyone!)
{Inside the new hall}there will be one 
 large hall with a wooden floor, where 
 main activities will be held, and     
 badminton can be played. It also has a
 lounge,bar,kitchen,stores and toilets.</content>
