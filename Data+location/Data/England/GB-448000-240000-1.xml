		<title>01OUR AREA</title>
		<content>The area surveyed by our schools is in 
the South-West of Northamptonshire,a   
few miles to the east of the market    
town of Banbury,which lies across the  
county border in Oxfordshire.It is a   
mainly rural area,containing several   
small to medium sized farms of an      
average of two hundred acres,but also  
the village of Middleton Cheney lies at
the centre of the square.              
To the west of the square is a series  
of hills which form part of the        
Cherwell Valley,but the land flattens  
out to the east.The soil is quite heavy
and red in colour,containing clay and  
ironstone.                             
Middleton Cheney is an old village and 
most of the buildings in the centre are
made of stone.However the area is      
expandng as new housing estates are    
being built.The population of the      
village is about three thousand.       </content>
