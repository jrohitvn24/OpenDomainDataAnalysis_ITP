  Most of the houses in this area are  
 privately owned, but a small row of   
 council houses has been built in each 
 of the three villages. There are also 
 fourteen farms.                       
  Some of the houses in Croft were     
 built in the nineteenth century as    
 boarding houses for people coming to  
 take the spa waters, although there   
 has been more recent development in   
 all the villages. In Dalton on Tees   
 there are two small new private       
 estates being built, providing fifteen
 new houses.                           
  In Hurworth Place a warden controlled
 unit for elderly people has been      
 built, where the residents have their 
 own room, and there are community     
 rooms as well. In Croft on Tees eight 
 bungalows for the elderly were built  
 in 1983.                              </content>
