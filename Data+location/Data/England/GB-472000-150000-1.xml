		<title>01ODIHAM AND THE WOODLANDS</title>
		<content> Odiham is a small, rural town situated
 in north-east Hampshire, 42 miles from
 London. At North Warnborough, the     
 junction of the M3 provides access to 
 Southampton and London. The land is   
 divided equally between woodland and  
 farmland. The farmland is used for    
 grazing and growing crops. Dense      
 woodland areas, dominated by mature,  
 deciduous trees cover Odiham Common,  
 Broad Oak Common, Dogmersfield Park,  
 the banks of the Basingstoke Canal and
 the River Whitewater.Public foot-paths
 and tow-paths provide access to these 
 areas. Features of local, historical  
 interest, include Odiham Castle, the  
 Great Chalk Pit, Odiham Firs, All     
 Saints Church, the Pest House, the    
 Almshouses and period houses and      
 cottages in the Bury and High Street. 
 The main shopping area is in the High 
 Street.                               </content>
