		<content>  We carried out a survey to ask       
 people questions about Cinderford and 
 the surrounding area. These are some  
 of the answers gave.                  
 The main dislike is the sheep because 
 they go and spoil the plants. If      
 changes could be made it would be     
 stopping the sheep roaming around.    
 Most people like living here because  
 it is quiet.                          
 When people are having conversations  
 shopping crops up most.               
 In the future people think that       
 Cinderford will be a ghost town.      
 People think Foresters are very kind  
 people.
