		<title>05Sunday for a village boy.</title>
		<content>Keith is a little boy who lives in the 
village of Ellastone in a white        
little cottage with his parents and    
sister. On a typical Sunday Keith gets 
up at 8.30am. He has breakfast. Then   
he might go for a ride on his pony.    
After he helps his dad do the          
gardening or grease his lorry.   Then  
it's lunchtime. He has potatoes,       
greens, gravy, meat. After dinner he   
plays on his own. He has salad for tea 
and goes to bed at 8.30pm. There are   
very few children in the village and   
Keith gets lonely. The thing he likes  
doing most in the world is playing     
football. His favourite food is chips  
and thick soup.                        
  Keith gets taken to school by taxi.  
His parents say he is an aggravating   
child who likes to torment everybody.  
He is full of mischief but loveable.
