		<title>18LIFESTYLES_A WEEKEND</title>
		<content>                                       
 This is a weekend in summer for me.   
 Iam ten years old.Sometimes I go swim-
 ing in the sea,especially when the    
 weather is hot.The sea is quite cold, 
 but once you get in it's not so bad!  
 Sometimes I go out waist high,but I'm 
 careful to stay in my depth,because of
 the waves.Ilike the waves that don't  
 break best,so I can swim breaststroke 
 and you bob up and down.There is a    
 rock pool at Chapel Rock and in that  
 pool is a lot of sea water.I don't    
 like it much though,because it tends  
 to have stones at the bottom.         
  At the top of Chapel Rock is a       
 flagpole.On it go the warning flags   
 for all the bathers.They put up a red 
 flag when the sea is too rough to swim
 in safely.I enjoy going on the beach, 
 but not so much when it's crowded.
