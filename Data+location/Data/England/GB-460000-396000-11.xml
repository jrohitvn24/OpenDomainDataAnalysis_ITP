{BUSES }The most frequented form of    
 transport in Rossington is the bus    
 service.  Buses run from Rosssington  
 to Edlington via Doncaster.  Bus      
 fares are low, costing only 15 pence  
 to Doncaster. Buses run every 15      
 minutes, there are four routes and    
 many bus stops ensure that buses are  
 within a short walk of most Rossington
 homes.                                
                                       
{BICYCLES} Rossington is very flat and 
 cycling is very popular either for    
 travelling to work or for shopping in 
 the village.                          
                                       
{LORRIES  AND  CARS} Lorries travel    
 through Rossington either to the pit  
 or to the other industries or to      
 shops. Many private cars are used for 
 business or pleasure.                 </content>
