		<content> Both Combeinteignhead and             
 Stokeinteignhead have village halls   
 which are regularly used.             
 Stokeinteignhead once had a Drama     
 Group but that has recently disbanded.
 The Primary school puts on plays and  
 concerts, especially at Christmas, in 
 Stokeinteignhead village hall. Various
 organisations get together to present 
 concerts and comic shows from time to 
 time, particularly to raise funds for 
 themselves or to pay for the upkeep of
 the halls. The youth club organizes   
 discos. The nearest regular           
 professional theatre is in Exeter, or 
 occasionally at Torquay, while there  
 are cinemas and discos in Torquay and 
 Newton Abbot. Some local people belong
 to amateur operatic or dramatic groups
 in the nearby towns.
