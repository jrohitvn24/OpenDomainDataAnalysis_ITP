		<title>10The Milking Parlour.</title>
		<content>      We went to the milking parlour at
 Fulling Bridge Farm. 80 cows were     
 milked that day, 70 more were dry in  
 preparation for calving. The parlour  
 had 8 stalls each side. The stalls    
 were made to measure to fit the herd  
 of Friesian Holsteins, which are long 
 cows. Dave the cowman stood in a well 
 set in the middle of the parlour. The 
 clusters were raised and the gates    
 opened automatically. When the cluster
 was fitted onto the teats of the udder
 the milked was sucked out by alternat-
 ing pressure in the cups,and ran down 
 a tube into a large glass collecting  
 jar. When the milk flow stopped the   
 clusters fell off automatically and   
 Dave applied an antiseptic solution to
 the teats. The milk was pumped into a 
 large cooling tank to await collection
 by tanker lorry. Elaine Taylor age 11.
