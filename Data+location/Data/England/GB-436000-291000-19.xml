 There used to be two railway stations-
 Trent Valley,which is on the main line
 from London to Scotland and is still  
 used,and Abbey Street,which was on the
 local line between Leicester and      
 Birmingham and has now been closed.   
                                       
 During the 1939-45 War there was a lot
 of bomb damage in Church Street,      
 killing many people and destroying    
 homes.The new library was built where 
 these houses once stood.              
                                       
 The Coronation of Queen Elizabeth 11  
 was watched on a black and white TV   
 and at night there was a large bonfire
 in the park.                          
                                       
 The town has grown much bigger,the    
 streets wider and the centre is now a 
 pedestrian only area.                 </content>
