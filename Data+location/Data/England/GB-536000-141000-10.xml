		<content>   If you were a tourist and like      
 history, you would like to come to    
 Lingfield to its many old and         
 interesting buildings. The cage (or   
 lock_up) was built in the 18th Century
 and last used in 1882. This is by the 
 old oak tree which is on the village  
 crest. Gun Pit Road reminds us of the 
 days when guns were made here, The    
 Star Pub of Starborough Castle. The   
 mainly 14th Century church is large   
 and beautiful with cruesaders' tombs. 
 Nearby is Old Town, some very old     
 houses, once shops. The library is in 
 the old church guest_house.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
