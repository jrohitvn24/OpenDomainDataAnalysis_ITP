		<title>20HOME LIFE STAPEHILL</title>
		<content>{Stapehill}is a small village between  
 Wimborne and{Ferndown.}The only shops 
 are a Post Office, village store,     
 butcher, farm shop and hairdresser.   
 Many village people depend on these   
 shops for food, because they are      
 unable to get to Ferndown. The{village
{hall}is much used by the community for
 playgroups, meetings (of the Women's  
 Institute for example), polling       
 station, local amateur theatrical     
 productions, fetes and fairs, concerts
 and bingo. Many of the older residents
 use the hall regularly as it is a good
 meeting place. It is nearly always    
 booked for various events or clubs.   
 Polden's Nurseries are between        
 Stapehill and Ferndown. Mr Polden Snr 
 died in 1982 and now his son runs the 
 business, manufacturing compost and   
 selling it, also seeds, to garden     
 centres, as well as to the public.    </content>
