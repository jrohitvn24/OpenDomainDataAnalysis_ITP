The Red Scar Industrial Estate is built
on land which was on the Roman Route to
Ribchester.  The alternative name for  
the estate is the Roman Way.           
                                       
Before the factories and offices were  
built, the land was subjected to an    
archeological investigation to discover
the remains of the Roman Road.  Clegg's
Pit which is still there, but nowadays 
used for fishing, was used as a        
watering hole for the Romans on their  
way to their settlement at Ribchester. 
                                       
Just behind the Crematorium are the    
remains of the Red Scar Hall which was 
built in a picturesque setting         
overlooking the meander of the River   
Ribble.
