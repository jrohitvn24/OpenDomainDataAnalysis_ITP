		<content>  The most popular form of transport in
this area is easily the car,as Rainford
is a high car-owning area.Bikes are    
popular among the young and old,but    
mainly as a pastime.There are also two 
taxi services operating from Rainford. 
  Public transport is usually buses:   
there are nine different routes going  
through Rainford village.This adds     
up to about 78 buses per day.Passing   
through Crank there are 13 buses a day,
with 5 going to King's Moss.Going along
the Rainford By-Pass(A570) there are   
eight bus routes used every day.All    
of the buses going through Rainford go 
to/through St.Helens,except for one.   
  The bus services are well-used,espec-
ially at weekends,by people going to   
St.Helens,Southport etc..In rural areas
the bus services are,for many,the only 
link with the towns.
