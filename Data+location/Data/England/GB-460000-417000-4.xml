		<content> THE GRASS_CUTTERS ARE USED MOST       
 REGULARLY BUT THE BEET HARVESTERS WEAR
 OUT MOST QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE
 TOUGHEST JOB AND SO THEY ARE THE      
 MACHINES WHICH NEED REPLACING MOST    
 OFTEN. Mr. ASQUITH TENDS TO BUY       
 BRITISH MACHINERY.                    
  THE CROPS Mr. ASQUITH HARVESTS ARE   
 SUGAR BEET, BARLEY, WHEAT, OATS AND   
 RAPE. Mr. ASQUITH HAS THE MACHINERY TO
 DEAL WITH MOST LOCAL CROPS EXCEPT     
 POTATOES AND PEAS. HIS FAVOURITE JOB  
 IS SUGAR BEET DRILLING BECAUSE HE     
 FINDS IT VERY INTERESTING. HE THINKS  
 SUGAR BEET HARVESTING IS THE WORST JOB
 BECAUSE OF BAD CONDITIONS. HE WORKS   
 FOR 50 OR 60 LOCAL FARMERS AND ALSO   
 SPENDS MANY HOURS REPAIRING HIS       
 MACHINERY. HE WORKS BETWEEN 8 AND 16  
 HOURS A DAY DEPENDING ON THE SEASONS.
