		<title>10DUDLESTON CHURCH</title>
		<content> This church is very old with{Saxon    
 origins.On the south side of the      
 church is a{preaching cross.}Long     
 ago,before the church was built,people
 used to{worship}there.The cross has   
 worn away now but the shaft and steps 
 remain.The stone is slowly crumbling  
 away and moss is growing in the       
 cracks.                               
 In the{churchyard}are several ancient 
{yew trees.}In one tree the bell was   
 hung,whilst the tower was being       
 rebuilt.The tree has an iron belt     
 around it now because it's so old.In  
{1799,}there were{700 inhabitants}of   
{Dudleston,}now{only 45}remain.When we 
 went into the church, we found a lot  
 of interesting things.There was a     
 solid{oak chest,}once used for keeping
 money and church valuables in.We saw a
 stone{font}and a beautiful carved     
{Jacobean}pulpit.                      </content>
