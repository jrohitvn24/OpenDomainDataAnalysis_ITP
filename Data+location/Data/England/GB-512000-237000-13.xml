		<content> We went to visit Banks and Taylor, the
{Shefford brewery. }They were founded n
 1982 and make four kinds of beer -    
 Shefford Bitter, SPA, Eastcote Ale and
 SOS.                                  
                                       
 The first thing we saw was the grist  
 mill where the melted barley is ground
 up and fed into the mash tun with lots
 of hot water.  This is called         
 sparging.  The liquor then goes to a  
 huge copper where hops are added and  
 it is heated.  Then it is cooled and  
 piped into the fermentation vessel    
 with a whole bucket of yeast and left 
 there for about a week until it has   
 turned into beer.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
