		<title>03BEECH TREES IN THE CHILTERNS</title>
		<content>The Beech is one of the most beautiful 
forest trees. In Winter when the tall  
massive truncks are covered with       
smooth grey green bark it is displayed 
to advantages. It enormous branches    
come off at an angle or almost         
horizontally to produce a gigantic     
crown.                                 
In spring and summer the dense foliage 
casts a shade deeper than that of any  
other broad-leaved tree and above all  
in                                     
autumn the foliage turns to blazing red
goldern brown.                         
The woods around the Risborough area   
are mainly beech and near the famous   
Whiteleaf Cross thet are particular    
beautiful. In early summer the trees   
are out in full, birds are singing,grey
squirrels run around the ground and    
shoot up the trees, and everybody is   
enjoying the early summer sun.         </content>
