    My name is Duncan Ross.I am 10     
 years old and I live in Startforth.I  
 get up at 7:30am in the morning and   
 have cereal for breakfast.After       
 packing my bag I clean my teeth and   
 get ready to leave home.My Dad takes  
 my sister,brother and me to school on 
 his way to the surgery.After          
 prayers,we have lessons then a break  
 and then more lessons.Lunch is next   
 and my favourite is spaghetti         
 bolognaise.I like to play on the field
 afterwards.My mum meets me at school  
 and as soon as I get home,I have tea  
 and dash out to play on my bike with  
 my friends.We watch all the birds     
 nests and we have three baby          
 hedgehogs.Then I play on the computer 
 or watch television.After supper I    
 have a bath and go to bed at 9:00pm.
