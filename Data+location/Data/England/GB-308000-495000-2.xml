		<title>02WABERTHWAITE CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church of St.John is situated in  
 the hamlet of Hall Waberthwaite on the
 south bank of the Esk estuary. The    
 church is a plain rectangular building
 of early Norman design built in the   
 twelfth century. There is an ancient  
 sandstone cross shaft in the graveyard
 The churchyard contains many species  
 of unusual wild flowers, and is       
 especially attractive in Spring when  
 the crocuses and daffodils are in     
 flower. The church is part of the     
 combined parish of Eskdale, Irton,    
 Muncaster and Waberthwaite. Services  
 are held every fortnight, Matins and  
 Holy Communion alternating.The Book of
 Common Prayer is in regular use for   
 these. Activities,including a garden  
 open day and a sponsored entry in the 
 London Marathon,have helped to raise  
 money towards the appeal for a new    
 roof and internal refurbishment.      </content>
