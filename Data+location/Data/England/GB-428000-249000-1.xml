 This is a very rural part of south    
 Warwickshire,lying almost in the      
 centre of a triangle,with the         
 relatively prosperous towns of        
 Stratford-On-Avon,Royal Leamington    
 Spa, and Banbury at each corner.The   
 fertile agricultural land is mainly   
 used for arable farming,although      
 some pastural farming is evident.Two  
 features bisect the area, one         
 natural and one man made.The river    
 Dene north west to east through the   
 block,and along its course is to be   
 found Walton wood and other wooded    
 areas, mainly of a deciduous          
 nature.The Fossway, the famous Roman  
 road,runs north to south west and     
 even today is the main transport      
 route of note,despite the             
 B4451,which runs through Butlers      
 Marston..                             </content>
