 detached,semis are scattered          
 throughout the village.Some are brick,

   Following the second world war,a{   
{council housing development}was       
 completed in{1951.}Several have been  
 purchased by former tenants and they  
 are modernising them.Few have garages 
 attached.Some coal fires are still    
 being used.                           
   Today Mitford is a{desirable place  
{to live}for those working in the      
 nearby towns.Eight/ten new executive  
 stone bungalows and houses are        
 presently being constructed.All of    
 them will cost over{Â£85,000-}too much 
 for young local families to buy.
