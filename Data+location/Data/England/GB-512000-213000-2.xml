		<title>02St.Nicholas Church Harpenden</title>
		<content> The church stands on the village green
 of this busy commuter town.   It was  
 built in Norman times, and a few      
 stones now remain.   Harpenden        
 has grown around the church which has 
 been important in peoples' lives      
 through the ages.   People meet to    
 worship there and for baptisms,       
 weddings and funerals.   Lay people   
 often read lessons in well attended   
 services. The church is flourishing   
 and lively and members work to serve  
 the community.   Newcomers, the sick  
 and elderly are visited by church     
 representatives.  'Helping Hands' a   
 voluntary group has grown from this   
 and anyone can join.   Six clubs, like
 Young Mothers and the Wednesday Club, 
 are open to people of all religions   
 which the church works with as part of
 the ecumenical movements.
