		<content>Monday mornings I wake up at 7.30am.   
Breakfast is Weetabix, toast and tea.  
At 8.45 I leave for school, where I    
play football until the bell rings at  
9.00. Our teacher marks the register.  
We write our diaries for the weekend.  
At 9.20 a special lesson helps me. At  
10.35 we go out to play. I play        
football with my friends. After play we
watch Zig Zag on BBC2 and do some work 
about the programme. At 12.00 I have my
dinner, salad, carrots, mash and roast 
potatoes. Then I play football until   
1.15pm. For half the afternoon our     
headteacher takes our class. After     
playtime our teacher reads a story and 
we read to her, then change our reading
books. At 3.45pm I go home. I play     
outside, then go to have my tea-usually
curry and chapaties. I might watch an  
Indian film on the television or do    
some homework. At 9.00pm I go to bed.  </content>
