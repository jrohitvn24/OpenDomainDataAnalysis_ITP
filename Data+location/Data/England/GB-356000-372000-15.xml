		<title>15Crowton Pony Club</title>
		<content>  In the Pony Club there are about 34  
 children.  I joined last year.  We    
 cannot join until we are 7 and we     
 finish when we are 10 years old.  Then
 we join the Riding Club.              
  When we go to the club rallies they  
 are usually held on Saturdays.  At a  
 rally we have races and gymkhana games
 like bending races.  We also do       
 jumping.  My pony is no good at       
 gymkhana games but he is brilliant at 
 jumping.  I know most of the people at
 the rallies because they live in this 
 area.  I am going to a rally this     
 Saturday.                             
  At the Crowton Show I won second     
 prize in the Best Turned-Out Pony     
 class. I won that because I learned   
 how to look after my pony at the club.
