		<title>06Housing Patterns In Woolton</title>
		<content>   100 years ago, Woolton housing      
 consisted of small{terraced}workmen's 
{cottages}and large detached residences
 for the affluent. The release of the  
 Salisbury estate in the 1930's, led to
 the present emphasis on 'middle class'
 housing. A large area of the village  
 consists of comfortable{detached and  
{semi-detached houses of character}with
 fairly large gardens, garages and     
 large airy rooms.                     
   Small areas of terraced, council    
 owned property has been recently      
 renovated and modernised. Some small  
{council houses}have been built lately.
   Worker's cottages are gradually     
 being demolished and smart{sheltered  
{housing}for the aged and infirm is    
 beginning to appear.                  
   Large detached period houses are    
 built higher up the hill for the more 
 affluent.        G.T.RAWLINSON        </content>
