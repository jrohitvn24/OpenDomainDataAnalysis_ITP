		<title>18THE MINERS' STRIKE</title>
		<content>  The strike affected our school quite 
 a lot because their meeting place was 
 just over the road from our school.   
  At dinner times mums would come for  
 children who went home for dinners    
 because some strikers would wait      
 outside their meeting place for miners
 coming home from work.                
  One day I walked home along the      
 Avenue and walked passed some miners  
 who were on strike.I felt really      
 scared and wanted to run but thought  
 that they might think that my dad was 
 a miner.They must have been waiting   
 for the miners to come around the     
 corner from work.I turned the corner  
 and heard shouts.The miners were      
 yelling"SCABS!SCABS!SCABS!" I ran home
 feeling very frightened.
