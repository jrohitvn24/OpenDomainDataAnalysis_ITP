		<content>{  Don Jones,}life-long Suttonian,is a 
{railway enthusiast.}He has watched the
 rebuilding of Birmingham's New Street 
 Station,whilst simultaneously         
 reproducing it in his own back garden.
   A twenty by forty foot wooden shed  
 contains an entirely accurate 1:30    
{scale model}of the sub-terranean      
 station and its associated shopping   
 centre.Don has used the architect's   
 original plans.                       
   Each building is painstakingly      
 re-created out of plastic and takes   
{hundreds of hours}to construct.       
   The New Street model has occupied   
 Don's leisure time for twenty four    
 years.The{suburban garden}now contains
 one{kilometre}of track.               
   Every year Don raises money for     
{charity}and delights the public at an 
 Open Day,when privileged visitors can 
 even control the model trains.        </content>
