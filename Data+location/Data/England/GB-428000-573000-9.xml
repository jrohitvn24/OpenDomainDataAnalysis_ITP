		<content> The houses in Seaton Delaval 30 years 
 ago were mainly{colliery rows}with    
 names such as Double Row, Foreman's   
 Row and Middle Row. When the colliery 
 closed in 1960 most of the population 
 had been re-housed nearer to the      
 Avenue Head.                          
 Today the houses are a mixture of     
 modern dwellings and pre-war terraced 
 housing. We did a survey of the{types 
{of houses}which the children in our   
 school live in. Here are the results: 
 Terraced house -33                    
 Semi-detached  -85                    
 Detached       -22                    
 Bungalow       - 3                    
 Terraced flat  - 3.                   
 In some places the shape of the       
 streets has hardly changed from the   
 turn of the century, in others what   
 were fields are now attractive modern 
 estates.                              </content>
