		<title>11BXL factory at Haltwhistle.</title>
		<content>{   BXL}stands for 'Bakelite Xylonite  
 Limited'.  About 30 years ago, most of
 the men in Haltwhistle worked down the
 pits, but these were being closed down
 so BXL moved into an old Government   
 warehouse to make plastic bottles.    
    They have 6 big silos to store the 
{polythene pellets}used to make the    
 bottles.  The pellets are melted into 
 a liquid and the hot liquid is forced 
 into moulds.  They make{1 million     
 bottles a day.  Some bottles have     
 names and pictures printed on them in 
 English and other languages.  They are
 filled with shampoo, washing-up, and  
 other liquids at factories in         
 Southampton, Liverpool and Manchester.
    The factory is very noisy.  The    
 factory works 24 hours a day.  A lot  
 of our mams work the 'twilight shift' 
 from 5.30pm to 10.00pm.
