		<title>17RECREATION/HORSE RIDING.</title>
		<content>{Horse Riding}is popular in this part  
 of the country but there are no public
 riding stables.It is mostly the farm- 
 ing comunity that own horses, grazing 
 them on their pasture land and bedding
 the animals in comfortable stables.   
 Riders are often to be seen trotting  
 round the country lanes, or practising
 jumps in the fields nearer to home,   
 and the horse-box is quite a common   
 vehicle here. Some riders belong to   
 the{Ashford Valley Hunt} and  "Hunter 
 trials" are sometimes held on local   
 farm land.  Other riders, both senior 
 and junior, are involved in events    
 like Show jumping and Point-to-point  
 races which take place further afield.
 A side product of Stables is of course
 Horse manure - and this can be        
 purchased by the bag (often at the    
 roadside) to enrich the garden.
