		<title>02NURSING HOMES</title>
		<content>  There are two nursing homes in       
 Burnham-on-Sea, and a great many old  
 people's homes. Old people like to    
 live here because it is close to the  
 beach and there is easy walking.      
                                       
  The home we visited had 50 old people
 living in it. There is a resident cat 
 called Miffy, although the people are 
 not allowed to have any pets except   
 caged birds.                          
                                       
  They often go for walks or on day    
 trips, and come and go during the day 
 as they wish.                         
                                       
  Special diets are sometimes required,
 and the food is attractive and        
 nourishing. There is a comfortable    
 lounge with a colour television and a 
 piano for sing-songs. The residents   
 are very happy there.                 </content>
