		<title>14  COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content>    The Committee of Gt.Staughton's    
 Community Association organises events
 throughout the year.                  
    Early Springtime has seen the      
 assembly of many local intellects -   
 young and old - as the preliminary    
 rounds of "Brains of Staughton" get   
 under way. These are well-supported   
 family occasions when various teams   
 compete for this much coveted title!  
    Annual participation in the Eastern
 Region's Inter Village Sports gave    
 Gt.Staughton the Championship in 1984.
    After Feast Week the keen gardeners
 amongst us prepare for August's       
 Horticultural Show.   A Community     
 Bonfire and Firework Display around   
 Nov.5th. marks the start of many other
 pre-Christmas activities (concerts,   
 parties etc.), not least of all the   
 Staughton Stagers Production.......a  
 Pantomime or Music Hall Variety Show. </content>
