		<title>03Population of Ferryhill</title>
		<content> Locals refer to Ferryhill as the vill-
 age but it is in fact a small town    
 with population 11,500(1981 census).  
 Until the early 20th Century Ferryhill
 was a small agricultural community.The
 opening of Dean and Chapter colliery  
 in 1902 saw rapid expansion to a town 
 of 10,000 population.This was because 
 of the building of terraced houses at 
 Dean Bank to provide homes for miners.
 The closure of the mine in 1965 saw a 
 slight decline but in recent years    
 there has been extensive building,both
 council and private ,which has        
 accounted for the present population  
 figures.
