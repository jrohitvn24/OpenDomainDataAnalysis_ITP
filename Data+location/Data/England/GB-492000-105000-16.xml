  The Council discussed the sad        
 condition of the bus shelter in Ivy   
 Lane;it was agreed that that this     
 should be removed.The Council were    
 aware that the shelter had become a   
 meeting place for many of the yonger  
 members of the community,some of whom 
 had nowhere else to go for            
 socialising.It was felt that there was
 inadequate provision  within the      
 village for those young people who    
 wished to meet during the evening not 
 necessarily with adult supervision.   
 The council agreed that the problem of
 accommodation for young people should 
 be examined in greater detail and that
 the approprite bodies and individuals 
 shoud be consulted.
