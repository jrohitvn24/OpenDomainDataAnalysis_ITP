		<title>10PARISH PRIEST'S LIFE</title>
		<content> Rev.Willis is the Vicar of the newest 
 parish in Ramsgate-St.Mark's.Formerly 
 a daughter church of St.Luke's it     
 attained Parish status in 1983 and    
 Rev.Willis is the second vicar.He     
 explained that his work is very       
 different from a priest when the      
 Doomsday Book was compiled.He works   
 for about 12 hours a day, 6 days a    
 week.Each day begins with prayer and  
 Bible study.He spends a lot of time on
 paperwork but part of  each day is    
 spent visiting some of his 7,000      
 parishioners particularly the old.    
 Sermons have to be prepared and       
 meetings attended.Baptisms are carried
 out for the young and adults providing
 they attend church for 3 months.As    
 St.Mark's is a modern church only 8   
 weddings annually are conducted-people
 prefer older prettier churches.Rev.   
 Willis likes talking to children.     </content>
