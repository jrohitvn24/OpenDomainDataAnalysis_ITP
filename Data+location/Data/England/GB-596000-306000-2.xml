		<content>{Shipdham airfield}was used during the 
 second world war by an American bomber
 squadron flying Liberators. Now there 
 is a large industrial estate based    
 around the wartime buildings. Most of 
 the airfield is now farmland,a mixture
 of grazing for{Grange Farm's}herd of  
 Fresian cows and cereal crops.There is
 also rough grass around the runways   
 used by{Norfolk Beagles}for Hare      
 hunts.{Arrow Air Services}is based on 
 the airfield and two of the runways   
 are still in service, used by a large 
 variety of aircraft which come into   
 the airfield for servicing,           
 refuelling, crop spraying, pleasure   
 flights or renovation. In total the   
 airfield covers 28 acres. It is a     
 green belt area. The industry and     
 leisure facilities there are important
 to the whole county, not just         
 Shipdham.                             </content>
