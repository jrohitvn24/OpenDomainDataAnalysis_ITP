		<title>12Victorian Weekend S.Clifton</title>
		<content> A substantial sum of money was        
 required to finance repairs  at       
 St.Georges Church,North Clifton.To    
 provide this a committee was formed to
 organise a Victorian Weekend in South 
 Clifton.The first weekend in July 1984
 was chosen.The village was completely 
 closed to traffic after 10am on the   
 Saturday and Sunday.Stalls were       
 erected in the village streets by the 
 inhabitants and decorated gaily.A     
 prize was awarded for the best dressed
 stall.All the villagers dressed in    
 Victorian costume and strolled round  
 the village.Some of the highlights    
 apart from ths stalls were a steam    
 engine giving rides to the church to  
 see a flower display with taped       
 singing by the schoolchildren of songs
 sung in 1884,an exhibition of bygones 
 in the school,demonstrations of       
 spinning,maypole dancing,Morris dancin</content>
