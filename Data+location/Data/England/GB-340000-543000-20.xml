		<content> Although the local church is well-    
 supported by the local community, this
 is so more from good will than from   
 any deep sense of conviction and      
 commitment.  And it must also be said 
 that despite the generosity of folk to
 many appeals, our attitudes are still 
 very parochial, even though our       
 consciences may from time to time spur
 us to give.                           
                                       
 The comparatively recent advent of TV 
 (on average for many a mere 25 years  
 ago) has nonetheless allowed us to    
 'receive' information, both tragic and
 joyful, from all parts of the world,  
 and yet permit us to continue to think
 of it all happening 'out there' with  
 little relevance to ourselves.        
                                       
 It may be hoped that you in the future
 may a achieve a more united world.    </content>
