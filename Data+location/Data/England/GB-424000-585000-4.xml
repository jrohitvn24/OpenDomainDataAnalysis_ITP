		<content> Most of the population of Ashington   
 are employed under the mining         
 industry.The employment figures in    
 1985 are very low and many families   
 suffer hardship because of this.      
   Those members who are fortunate     
 enough to be employed work in the     
 local NCB coalmines.As this is the    
 main industry many people depend upon 
 it in order to survive.Unemployment is
 mainly familiar with high school      
 leavers,aged 16 and over because jobs 
 are just simply not available.        
 however,many decide to take up YTS    
 courses in their chosen career at the 
 nearby technical college.             
   Courses range from bricklaying to   
 computer programming and many         
 candidates succeed.Althogh the        
 unemployment situation remains it is  
 being relieved by new complexes being 
 built in Ashington.                   </content>
