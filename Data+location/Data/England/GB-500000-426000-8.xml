		<title>08ST.PETER'S CHURCH IN ANLABY</title>
		<content> There has been a church on this site  
 since 1865 although the present       
 building dates from 1885. Apart from  
 the usual services performed weekly   
 and monthly in the church, weddings,  
 baptisms and funerals also occur. The 
 numbers involved so far this year (up 
 to 12.7.85) are as follows: 14        
 weddings; 16 baptisms (12 boys, 4     
 girls); 30 funerals (13 men: youngest 
 62, oldest 86; 17 women: youngest 47, 
 oldest 93). The church collects about 
 Â£200 during its weekly services but   
 has an annual expenditure of Â£17000.  
 St. Peter's is busy throughout the    
 week. Every day it is used by one or  
 more of a variety of groups. These    
 include brownies, guides, scouts and  
 cubs as well as adults' clubs such as 
 a fitness group, a needlework class   
 and a companions club for the over    
 60's.                                 </content>
