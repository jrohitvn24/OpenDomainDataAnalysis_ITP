		<title>06OMPTON VILLAGE, KNEESALL.</title>
		<content> One Monday we went down to Ompton to  
 see Mrs.Prinold.We talked to her about
 the family's farm and Ompton.When they
 first started dairy farming at Ompton 
 in the mid 1930's it was very wild    
 and not very good pasture land,but it 
 has gradually changed and their herd  
 has grown.With good management and    
 the use of fertilisers,the land has   
 improved.On commencing farming they   
 only had a herd of 30 cows because    
 they had to milk by hand,but now they 
 milk by machine.The family have 160   
 acres and have 90 cows in milk.       
  Omton is a small village, with no    
 shop or pub and people have to go     
 several miles for goods or for        
 entertainment.But in some ways life is
 better than before because of the use 
 of modern  machines and power.The     
 young people though often leave the   
 area when they are adults.            </content>
