		<title>18HOBBIES ON ALSTON MOOR</title>
		<content> Hobbies differ in Alston Moor from    
 traditional to new ideas.             
 In season,grouse and pheasant shooting
 is very popular; this is one of the   
 traditional hobbies. Beating(walking  
 in a line to raise the birds) has been
 going on for many years. There are    
 several clubs which satisfy people's  
 interests and help them with their    
 hobbies. The Alston Ski Club has been 
 running about 18 months and is very   
 popular because of the climate that we
 get, and looks to having a promising  
 future.                               
 A part of the Town Hall is now        
 a Social Club. This will be open      
 during the day and in the evening.    
 For the girls and boys between 7 and  
 11 years of age there are Brownies and
 Cubs, and for those between 12 and 16 
 there are Guides, Scouts and the Youth
 Club.                                 </content>
