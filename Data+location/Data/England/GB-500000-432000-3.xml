		<title>03 The Remains of Risby Hall.</title>
		<content>  In the north west corner of the      
 segment are the remains of an old     
 manor house at Risby. The remains are 
 just grassy mounds. We have not been  
 able to find out much about the       
 remains. There is a large farm there  
 now. A few metres along the road there
 is a small abandonned quarry where the
 farmer leaves his rubbish.            
                                       
  The land around the remains is mainly
 grazing land but there is also some   
 arable land.
