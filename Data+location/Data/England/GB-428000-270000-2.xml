{1883.}Throughout its hundred year     
 history the line and station have had 
 a{pronounced effect}on the{life of the
{town.}Coal usage promoted the{growth  
 of{industry and new business -}for    
 example -{Kenilworth}being a small    
{farming community}had only two coal   
 merchants until the{Railway           
 opened. This figure rapidly rose to   
 six in only a few short years. Old,   
{cottage-type industries}common in the 
 mid-nineteenth century such as{comb   
{makers}were lost to large{brick works 
 and similar industries by the turn of 
 the century.{The line}was at its

 the{20th century.}By this time there  
 were ten coal merchants in the town   
 and{tourism}had become a{booming
