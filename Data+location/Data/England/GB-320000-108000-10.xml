		<title>10North Upottery:Roads,lanes.</title>
		<content>   This area is mostly one of tiny     
 lanes;and very lovely they are,with   
 tall hedges,whose ancient banks are   
 covered in primroses,violets,bluebells
 and campion in the spring.However,the 
 network of lanes connects up with a   
 good road that runs from the A.30 near
 Honiton to Taunton through Upottery;  
 and also with the main A.303 to       
 London.                               
   The Taunton road is a well-surfaced 
 country road,climbing through pretty  
 scenery out of Upottery,skirting the  
 beeches of Beacon Hill,then out on to 
 the plateau.Traffic is very light.    
   With the A.303 we have a love-hate  
 relationship,especially in the        
 summer-time,when it is choc-a-bloc    
 with holiday-makers' cars and almost  
 impossible to enter from our lanes.Its
 traffic blocks are frequent and make  
 marketing trips a nightmare.          </content>
