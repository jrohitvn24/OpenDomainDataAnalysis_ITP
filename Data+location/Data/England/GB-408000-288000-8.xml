		<title>08Home life in Witton</title>
		<content>Witton is an area containing above     
average size families of 6 or more.The 
majority of people in this closely knit
community are not born in Birmingham.  
Most families speak an Asian language  
with little English spoken at home.They
listen to ethnic music and watch their 
own videos in their mother tongue.Most 
children attend the Mosque every       
evening from 4-6.30 and at weekends.   
Very few signs of sexual equality at   
home exist,with women doing housework  
and the men decorate.Tarvel is very    
restricted as most families do not own 
a car.Few admit to smoking but those   
who do are in the 40+ age range.In most
cases hobbies are limited to those     
confined within the home.Cats form the 
majority of the few pets owned.The main
sources of reading matter are the daily
papers and the majority of readers are 
in the 5-11 and 23-50 age ranges.      </content>
