		<title>14THE PHANTOM FUNERAL</title>
		<content>   There is a legend passed on by the  
 villagers who live around the Long    
 Mynd about a{Phantom Funeral}         
 procession.                           
   The{Phantom Funeral}is supposed to  
 pass along the{Portway}on the Long    
 Mynd.At the front of the procession   
 were two black horses and behind the  
 hearse travelled a crowd of mourners. 
 Behind them,in a hollow of the road,a 
 crowd used to stand quietly until the 
 procession was out of sight.Then the  
 people would go home and the next day 
 they would remember nothing.The       
 procession started from{Ratlinghope   
{Church}or from where the people were  
 buried.                               
   Behind the hearse walked a group of 
 skeletons who followed the hearse.    
 Nobody would lead the two black       
 horses they would walk by themselves.
