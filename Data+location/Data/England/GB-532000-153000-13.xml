   One well-known resident was{JOEY    
{DEACON.}He could not speak or control 
 his movemnets. He made noises which   
 only his friend Ernie understood.     
 Ernie told Tom what Joey had said. Tom
 wrote it down and gave it to Michael  
 who typed it using one finger. This   
 was published as a book called{"JOEY".
 Many people read Joey's book including
 Dutch people who sent some money to   
 the hospital. A bungalow was built    
 with the money.

 build more bungalows. In these        
 bungalows live the five children who  
 are resident in the hospital.
