		<title>14     MERSEY FERRIES</title>
		<content> The areas of{New Ferry}and{Rock Ferry 
 are named after{Ferry routes}which    
 used to cross the{Mersey.  The New    
{Ferry Pier}used to  be on a site on   
 the river at the bottom of a road     
 called{The Dell. }Our school is on    
 that road.  Sadly the ferries were    
 taken over by the buses, trains and   
 cars which use{tunnels}under the      
{Mersey.}This is much faster but       
{ferries}are cheaper and more          
 enjoyable. Today only two of the many 
 routes remain. {Liverpool to          
{Birkenhead}and{Liverpool to Wallasey. 
 These have been threatened with       
 closure.  For centuries ferries were  
 the only way to cross the Mersey.     
 Fast flowing tides make it difficult  
 for small craft.  The ferries are     
 still used to travel to and from work,
 but are mainly used for leisure now.
