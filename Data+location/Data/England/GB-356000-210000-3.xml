		<content> We did a survey of shopping in the    
 area.Lifelong residents preferred to  
 shop in Coleford,leaving the area only
 for unobtainable bigger items.Many    
 people made two to three trips to town
 for food supplies.Sometimes others    
 went for them.Trips to larger shopping
 centres were once a fortnight or once 
 a month,usually to{Gloucester,Hereford
{,Monmouth,Ross-on-Wye}or              
{Cheltenham.Some people said they would
{like to see Boots,W.H. Smith or       
{Woolworth.There was too little compe- 
{tition with only one chemist in the   
{town.A furniture store would cut down 
{travelling.A few said they did not    
{like Coleford as a shopping           
 centre.Recently competition has       
 increased with the addition of a third
 supermarket.Some saw that as a good   
 thing.Many were impressed with the    
  building suppliers and{D.I.Y.shops.  </content>
