		<title>12ADVENTURE EDUCATION WEEK 1</title>
		<content> The 3rd and 4th years each year go on 
 an{Outdoor Education Week.}This year  
 we went to{St.Just in Roseland.}We    
 stayed in the old school there. One   
 afternoon we went down to the beach   
 and did a{beach study.}Three ladies   
 from the {Cornwall Conservation Trust 
 came to help us.We found lots of      
 different seaweeds and looked up their
 names.Here are some of them: Bladder  
 Wrack,Toothed Wrack, Twisted Wrack,   
 Channelled Wrack, Egg Wrack,Lettuce   
 Wrack and Enteromorpha.               
 We looked under lots of stones and    
 found many animals.We saw crabs and   
 found what is called a butter fish.We 
 had to obey one rule - always to put  
 stones back where we found them,so we 
 did not destroy any animal's home.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
