 This area lies in the Middle Marsh of 
 Lincolnshire  with the Wolds to the   
 west and the Marsh and Coast to the   
 East.It is very fertile being mainly  
 arable farming but there are beef     
 production, dairy and pig farms. Most 
 of the land drains into the Great Eau,
 a clear running stream which rises at 
 the foot of the Wolds.Our water supply
 is provided by the Anglian Water      
 Authority from bores in the Wolds. It 
 is very hard water. Although there is 
 no wooded area the land is pleasantly 
 dotted with deciduous trees. The A157 
 and B1200 are busy roads especially in
 the summer as they lead to the seaside
 and a picnic area is well used at the 
 entrance to Legbourne. Many houses    
 have been built in Legbourne recently.
 It is a pleasant area to live in with 
 clean air and green vegetation.       </content>
