		<title>07Palmer's Farm  1</title>
		<content> From an interview with Mr.McCheyne of 
          Palmer's Farm.               
   Mr. McCheyne farms approximately 130
 acres from the brook northwards and   
 his brother farms the remainder of the
 land in the north-west of our block.  
 Now semi-retired, he has been in      
 farming all his life.When his father  
 was killed by a V1 bomb in the fields 
 in front of the house,in 1943,the two 
 brothers took over the running of the 
 farm.                                 
   The farm no longer supports a dairy 
 herd, since the introduction of herd  
 testation,and the original cropping   
 of sugar beet, potatoes and oats has  
 been simplified to a wheat, barley and
 oilseed rape rotation,which involves  
 less hard work.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
