		<content>   Our area of the Domesday Project is 
 for the most part agricultural.The    
 majority of people employed who work  
 in the area work on the land.There are
 however a few small industries around 
 who employ local labour.The industries
 there are tend to be situated in and  
 around the villages of Bromsash and   
 Aston Crews.Other people who live in  
 the area commute to work to the local 
 town of Ross-on-Wye or farther afield 
 to Hereford,Gloucester or the Forest  
 of Dean.                              
   In the village of Bromsash a man and
 his son work from their home repairing
 radios and televisions.The business   
 has been going on for forty years.The 
 house they work in is over 300 years  
 old.They use all sorts of machines and
 equipment;nothing much has changed    
 since they have lived there.
