		<content>           Potato Harvesting.          
     by Mark Williams. (Roskestal)     
 One morning we started potatoes. I    
 helped on the harvester, it was a bit 
 windy and dusty. We did have a cover  
 on it but it broke and I got sore eyes
 in the morning. Then we loaded three  
 trailers and we had to load them on   
 the ground.                           
 My grandpa drove the tractor and my   
 dad picks up the sacks of potatoes.   
 I pick up the rotten potatoes from the
 machine. The workmen help. We got a   
 new tractor for pulling the harvester.
 At midday we went in for dinner, we   
 had sandwiches and salad and then we  
 started again. I didn't go because my 
 dad said I didn't have to. Later I    
 went down on my bike to see them with 
 my sister. When we got down to the    
 field there was no tractor. They were 
 digging in another field.             </content>
