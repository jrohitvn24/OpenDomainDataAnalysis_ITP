		<content> Approximately one third of this area  
 is occupied by Hurst Estate which is a
 dairy and sheep farming enterprise.   
 This consists of two dairy herds of   
 about 120 head each and a flock of 200
 to 300 ewes.                          
                                       
 To the West lie small mixed farms     
 including fruit farms which call on   
 local casual labour at harvest time.  
 The main crops of these are apples,   
 pears and soft fruit.                 
                                       
 Petley Wood is now partially cleared  
 to parkland and a thriving deer farm  
 has developed with a herd of over 200 
 animals.                              
                                       
 There are also farms specialising in  
 poultry, especially turkeys, and the  
 raising of game birds.
