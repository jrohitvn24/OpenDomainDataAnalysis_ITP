		<content> We have many clubs in our village for 
 people to enjoy. They cover a wide    
 range of activities. There are clubs  
 which are of interest to all ages from
 the play group for the youngest to the
 Senior Citizens Club for the oldest   
 members of the village. Most of the   
 meetings are held in the Memorial Hall
 in the local park. Each club has its  
 own committee to arrange visits and   
 activities.                           
 The Gala takes place in June and is   
 supported by everyone in the village. 
 Another popular event is the pantomime
 produced by Harden Players with both  
 children and adults taking part.      
 Teenagers are welcome to the Youth    
 Club where they hold discos and run   
 sport teams. Ladies from the village  
 are also involved in work for the     
 Womens Institute.
