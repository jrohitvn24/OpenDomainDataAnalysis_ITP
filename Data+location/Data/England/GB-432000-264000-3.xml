		<title>03ARCHITECTURE OF LEAMINGTON.</title>
		<content>   The architecture of Leamington seems
 to me to fall into three main         
 categories.  They are as follows:     
{1.}Early 19th century Georgian style  
 houses built when Leamington was at   
 its height as a Spa town.  Many of    
 these houses were built in terraces,  
 some of which have survived, for      
 example Lansdowne Crescent.           
{2.}Buildings of the 1950's and 60's.  
 In this period many flats were erected
 in the form of multiple-storey tower  
 blocks. Some of these, as elsewhere,  
 are now in a terrible state of repair.
 How long will they survive?           
{3.}The new estates.In the past ten    
 years large estates of modern houses, 
 all very similar in design, have been 
 built in such areas as Sydenham.      
 Architects are now designing houses   
 which are more in keeping with the old
 buildings eg. mock Georgian style.    </content>
