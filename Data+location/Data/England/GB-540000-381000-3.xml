		<content> The local rector is on the governing  
 bodies of a number of schools in the  
 area and through his connections with 
 a bishop in Zambia who has visited St.
 Margaret's School in 1985, the        
 children have made and sent a book    
 about their village to Zambia. This   
 book has been used in a number of     
 schools in Zambia. The children from  
 the village annually visit Lincoln    
 Cathedral for a special service for   
 all children attending church schools 
 in the county. At this service,       
 children from the school contribute   
 readings and prayers which they have  
 produced in school.
