		<title>14HACKLINGE AREA ECOLOGY</title>
		<content> The area contains several relatively  
 undisturbed habitats for wild-life.   
 Botanists delight in the wet meadows  
 and dykes of Worth Minnis, Hacklinge  
 and Ham Fen. The dykes grow nationally
 rare plants and the fen has rare moths
 and butterflies. Two places in the    
 area are designated Sites of Special  
 Scientific Interest and such are      
 protected and conserved. The region is
 rich in all kinds of wild life.       
 Visiting swallows were fewer this year
 A fox reared its cubs in the derelict 
 garden of Ilex Cottage. The slagheap  
 was grassed and planted with 3000     
 trees. The Southern Water  Authority  
 maintains the streams and dykes but   
 there has been some pollution from    
 crop-spraying. Footpaths are in a     
 reasonable state and are well used.   
 Dead elms at Hacklinge are to be      
 replaced.                             </content>
