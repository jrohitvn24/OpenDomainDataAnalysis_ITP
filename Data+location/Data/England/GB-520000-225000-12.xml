		<title>12SCHOOLS EVENTS STEVENAGE</title>
		<content> The seven schools in this block       
 arrange various fund-raising events   
 such as Fetes,Jumble sales,Flea       
 Markets and Car Boot sales. All of    
 these events are ways that parents and
 teachers can increase the income of   
 the schools so that facilities and    
 materials can be improved for the     
 children. At these sales some people  
 pay about Â£5 to hire a table or space 
 to park their car to sell toys, books,
 games or articles they have made or   
 bought for resale.                    
     Sometimes schools have sponsored  
 events when children learn spellings  
 or tables or go on walks and families 
 and friends give them a donation to   
 give to their school.                 
     Other events such as concerts and 
 sports days are organised for fun and 
 entertainment.                        
                                       </content>
