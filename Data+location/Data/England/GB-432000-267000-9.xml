		<title>09GRESHAM SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Some of us from Lillington First    
 School went to visit Gresham School.  
 Mr Sturley the Head teacher told us   
 that children from Leamington and all 
 the villages to the East can go to    
 Gresham if they find the work too hard
 in their ordinary schools.            
   There are about 100 children aged   
 from 6 to 16 and they can start at any
 age between 6 and 9. Each class has   
 about 13 children and they do lots of 
 nice things like cooking, carpentry   
 and table tennis as well as lessons   
 like ours.                            
   They go camping at weekends, also   
 canoeing and rock climbing. They go on
 lots of school trips, don't wear a    
 uniform and come to school on a       
 mini-bus. It's a really nice school.
