		<title>10A Sparkwell Family Holiday</title>
		<content>   Last summer we went to stay in a    
 country cottage at Hurstbourne Priors 
 in Hampshire. Opposite the cottage is 
 an orchard which belongs to the       
 cottage.                              
   Near the cottage there is a river   
 and opposite the cottage is a church. 
 It is called St.Andrew's Church. We   
 went down to the river on our first   
 day. We saw the place where they used 
 to hang people for stealing in the    
 olden days. Stonehenge is about 10    
 miles away.                           
   We went to Southsea to catch the    
 hovercraft over to the Isle of Wight. 
 We saw the Bourne Valley which is     
 famous for its water-cress beds.      
   We enjoyed our holiday in Hampshire 
 very much.
