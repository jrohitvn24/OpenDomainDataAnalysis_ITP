		<title>07Millbay Cove, Kingswear.</title>
		<content> A group of us went with our teacher   
 along the Kingswear Coastal Footpath  
 to Millbay Cove. The beach is         
 stoney,but sand appears as the tide   
 goes out. There is a freshwater stream
 running down the middle to the sea. We
 looked in the rockpools,and found     
 anemones,winkles,limpets and tiny     
 crabs. The anemones were so soft that 
 we could hardly feel them. We climbed 
 the rocks on each side of the bay to  
 look at the wild flowers. We found    
 thrift,sea cabbage and red campion. At
 the top of the beach is an old        
 boathouse built like a castle.There is
 also an old slipway and the remains of
 an old winch. The bay looks very      
 scruffy because there is masses of    
 rubbish on the tide line. We looked   
 for treasure but didn't find any!
