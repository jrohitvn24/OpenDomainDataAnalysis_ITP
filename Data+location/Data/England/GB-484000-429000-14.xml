		<content>   I saw the news programme about the  
 famine in Ethiopia. I thought that it 
 was terrible that I had so much food  
 and comfort in my home, while the     
 children in Ethiopia were starving. I 
 asked my mother if I could set a stall
 up outside my house and sell some of  
 my books and toys to raise money to   
 buy food for Ethiopia.My mum said that
 I would raise more money if I had a   
 jumble sale at school.                
  So the next day I asked Mrs.Walker,  
 my head mistress if I could ask all   
 the children in Newport School to     
 bring jumble, books and toys to school
 on Saturday morning.All my friends    
 thought it was a good idea.We made    
 over a hundred pounds on that Saturday
 which amazed me.I only thought we     
 would make a few pounds.We bought high
 enery biscuits with the money and sent
 them to Ethiopia.  Clare Hardcastle.  </content>
