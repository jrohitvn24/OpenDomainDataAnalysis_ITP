		<title>17Water Power</title>
		<content> In the past water power was one of the
 major sources of power in our         
 rectangle.A water wheel in our area   
 that still works when sufficient water
 is supplied is to be found at         
 Newmills.This water wheel was made by 
 T.Coombe and Sons.It was made in 1905 
 and is capable of generating 18 horse 
 power.It is about 18 feet aross and   
 weighs 2 tons.The water wheel is made 
 of cast iron.The mill itself was used 
 for grinding corn.In order to get     
 water to the water wheel a leat was   
 constructed.This is still visible     
 though  it is now filled with an      
 assortment of rubbish.
