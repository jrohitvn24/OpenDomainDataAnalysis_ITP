		<title>10HOUSING ESTATES IN OXSHOTT</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in the area were   
 built after 1945 in the gardens or    
 grounds of larger houses built in the 
 1880's/1890's. Most of those houses   
 have been pulled down or are now      
 schools or institutions (e.g. the     
 Schiff Home, formerly Knowle Park).   
 The post war houses are typical       
 middle-class suburban homes,          
 semi-detached with large well kept,   
 well stocked gardens. The charm of    
 many roads and cul-de-sacs is         
 increased by the the well grown trees 
 that were planted in the grounds of   
 former estates (e.g. two magnificent  
 Wellingtonias in Lodge Close (square  
 9) are still preserved.               
 In 1945, 6 council houses were built  
 on cheaper land in square 6. They are 
 well kept 3 bedroomed house with metal
 window frames. After 1951, about 12   
 more council houses were built.       </content>
