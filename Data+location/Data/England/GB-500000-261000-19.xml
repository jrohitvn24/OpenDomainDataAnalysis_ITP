      Legal maturity is now reached at 
 the age of eighteen, but we prefer to 
 celebrate 'coming-of-age' at the old  
 legal age of twenty one.  So on July  
 29th l985 we celebrated the 2lst      
 birthday of our daughter, Jill.       
      A marquee was erected on the     
 lawn, with tables and chairs, a dance 
 floor and disco instruments arranged  
 within.                               
      Who was invited?  Godparents,    
 relatives, old playmates, school      
 friends from Riseley and Bedford,     
 nursing friends, local farming        
 friends, family friends and past and  
 present vicars of our parish.         
      On arrival each guest was greeted
 by Jill, offered a glass of sherry and
 escorted to the marquee.  Any gifts   
 presented were placed aside safely.
