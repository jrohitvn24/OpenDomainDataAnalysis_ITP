		<content> The village has a medical SURGERY held
 in an end-of-terrace house near the   
 fire station in the HIGH STREET on    
 MONDAYS,TUESDAYS,WEDNESDAYS and       
 FRIDAYS from 8.30am.until 10.00am.    
 DR.PARKES has been the village DOCTOR 
 for the past 16 years.He has a keen   
 sense of humour and is popular with   
 his patients.His partner is DR.ALLEN  
 from nearby Cowfold.If the SURGERY is 
 closed a recorded telephone message   
 gives information on EMERGENCIES. In  
 this event Crawley,Chichester,Brighton
 and Midhurst HOSPITALS are used.When  
 accidents happen at school DR.PARKES  
 is called upon.Because of the many    
 families with young children in the   
 village the DOCTOR is involved with   
 the usual childhood ailments and      
 illnesses.
