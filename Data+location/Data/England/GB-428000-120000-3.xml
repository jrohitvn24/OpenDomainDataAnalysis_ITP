		<title>03OIL PIPELINES</title>
		<content> Another feature which we thought would
 cause a lot of concern was the laying 
 of a large oil pipeline through the   
 area. However, no one seemedto mind as
 those affected had been paid          
 compensation and great care has been  
 taken to restore the land to its      
 original appearance.                  
                                       
 There are some more general concerns. 
 The area has very narrow roads and so 
 farm traffic and cars do not always   
 mix well. At times of hay and silage  
 making and harvest time some people   
 are disturbed by the noise of         
 machinery and by the blowing of dust  
 and straw into their gardens. Also, in
 some areas where pigs are kept flies  
 are attracted which upsets some       
 people.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
