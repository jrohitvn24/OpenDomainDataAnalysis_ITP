  The Industrial Estate in Penkridge   
has been there since 1968.  It is      
situated on Wolgarston Way near the    
junction of the Wolverhampton Road and 
Lyne Hill Lane.It consists of mostly   
offices and workshops.There are four   
factories on the site,these are:       
Mitchell Cotts :Which produce slurry   
pumps.British Sugar Corporation :Which 
store sugar.SPD Warehousing :Who rent  
out warehouses,and Caven               
Engineering:Who make jigs and          
fixtures.There are not now so many     
factories on the site due to the       
recession,recently Michelin tyres have 
closed down.This has happened to many  
of the factories on the site so the is 
not as big and prosperous as it used to
be.
