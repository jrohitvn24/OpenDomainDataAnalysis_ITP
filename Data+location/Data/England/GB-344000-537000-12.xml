		<title>12INDUSTRY -METAL MANUFACTURER</title>
		<content> Porter's of Calthwaite is a local     
 employer of men experienced in the    
 manufacture of items constructed of   
 steels and other metals.  Originally  
 the business served the needs of the  
 farming community, with such items as 
 fittings for milking parlours, cages  
 for stock, gates, etc.                
                                       
 Expansion into manufacture for a wide 
 range of needs has taken place, and   
 now some 12 people are employed at the
 works.  Pallets of various types are  
 made from angle, tube or hollow       
 section steel, with a variety of      
 combinations using mesh, plate and    
 timber.                               
                                       
 Porter's have recently begun to export
 some of their products from the       
 country.
