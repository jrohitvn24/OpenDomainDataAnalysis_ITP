      Our area is mostly compiled of   
 fields which mainly belong to the     
 farms.The height of the ground of our 
 area is about seven an a half metres  
 above sea-level.The next largest area 
 is covered by orchards.Houses cover   
 quite a bit of land but do not appear 
 in all the small squares.Roads and    
 tracks cover a smaller percentage of  
 land.The smallest area of land is     
 covered by drains which drain the     
 water from the land because it is so  
 low.The grid is a 4 by 3 grid.In each 
 grid there are a hundred small        
 squares.On page 2 it will show you how
 many percent all the items are in each
 grid.
