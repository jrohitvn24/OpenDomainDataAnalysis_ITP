		<title>14STOW FAIR</title>
		<content> In 1475 the{Abbot of Evesham,}then    
{Lord of the Manor,}was granted a{Royal
{Charter}by Edward IV to hold a fair in
 May and October. For centuries this   
 was mainly a{sheep fair}held in the   
 Market Square but now it is almost    
 exclusively concerned with{horses and 
{ponies.                               
  The sales are held down the Swell    
 Road while a{fun fair}fills the       
 Square. It is an important occasion in
 the{Gipsy}calendar, for a great deal  
 of horse-dealing takes place away from
 the official{auction}rings. On these  
 two occasions the roadside is crowded 
 with{market stalls}selling a wide     
 variety of goods. This does lead to   
 considerable{traffic congestion.      
  Some newcomers to the area would like
 to see the Fairs subject to much      
 tighter controls, but the locals are  
 quite happy with it the way it is!    </content>
