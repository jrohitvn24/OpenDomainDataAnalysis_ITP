		<content> PENT FARM was the home of Joseph      
 Conrad from 1899 to 192O. During these
 years he wrote 'Lord Jim','Typhoon',  
 'Nostroms'  and other best sellers.   
 Among his numerous visitors were      
 H.G.Wells and G.B.Shaw. 'Pent' means  
 'in the lee of', the house and farm   
 lie in the lee of a fold in the Downs.
 The village also contains a very fine 
 example of a timber framed Tudor      
 farmhouse in Postling Court which is  
 considered to be the best of its kind 
 south of Canterbury.
