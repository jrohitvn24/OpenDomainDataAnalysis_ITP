		<title>12HOUSES GREENHALGH/ROSEACRE</title>
		<content> There are some very old houses of     
 handmade bricks retaining their       
 original external appearance. Others  
 have been faced or whitened. Roseacre 
 has a few interesting houses; most are
 100 to 150 years old. The farm houses 
 are very large with attics and        
 cellars. Two built since 1948 have    
 tablets inscribed "Queen Anne's       
 Bounty". This chartiy, set up in 1703 
 to aid poor clergy, was amalgamated   
 with the Church Commissioners, the    
 then owners of teh properties, in     
 1948. Some farm cottages still remain 
 tied for farm workers only; others are
 let.
