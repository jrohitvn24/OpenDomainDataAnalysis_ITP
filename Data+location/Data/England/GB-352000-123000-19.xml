		<title>19Interview with a ground crew</title>
		<content>  We talked to one of the{800          
{ground crew staff}at R.N.A.S. who work
 in the{17 hangers}on{9 different types
 of plane.On average it takes one and a
 half hours to check a plane with a{6  
{man crew,}but when something is wrong 
 up to 10 men will work on the plane.  
 Each man works a{40 hour week.        
   Each plane is checked out every day 
 before it flies and rechecked between 
 each flight that same day.Occasionally
 a rescue service has to be mounted.   
 The{worst accident}was 5 years ago    
 when a German Star Fighter crashed.   
{  Training}includes 3 months in a     
 classroom, 3 months practical work on 
 planes and a further 3 months for each
 type of plane you work on.            
   When the planes{go to sea,}the      
 ground crew go with them and this     
 makes the job interesting. The worst  
 part of the job is cleaning the plane!</content>
