		<title>05A Village Shop</title>
		<content> The owner of the shop has lived in    
 West Buckland for 2\ years.She moved  
 to this village because the shop was  
 the cheapiest availiable in the       
 area.They have a car and a van for    
 deliveries.                           
 Their shop is very important for the  
 village life and many old and young   
 people use it because it is the only  
 shop.                                 
 The owner does not get very much      
 leisure time,but when the shop is     
 quiet she has time to do things.      
 The owner thinks she will benefit when
 there is more traffic going passed the
 shop after the link road is built.The 
 shop owner thinks she has made        
 improvements to the shop by buying a  
 new meat slicer and a freezer to      
 improve the service for their         
 customers
