		<content> Nearby, on Roman Bank there was once  
 a row of old cottages perhaps used by 
 Woadmen. They now have old folks      
 bungalows on the site. Woad was grown 
 at the time of the Domesday Survey and
 indeed in Roman times. Our teacher    
 still grows woad in his garden. Woad  
 has been grown for centuries but was  
 last grown commercially at Skirbeck,  
 near Boston, Lincs. before 1932,      
 having had a rejuvenation in the      
 Napoleonic wars 1793-1815. It was     
 grown in Long Sutton in 1797 probably 
 down Woad Lane. Since the 16th century
 the better quality indigo from India  
 has been used as a blue dye. Since    
 1878 blue dye has been made in the    
 chemist's laboratory.
