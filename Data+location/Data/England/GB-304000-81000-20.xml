 Suprisingly for such a small town as  
 Salterton there is a thriving{Craft   
{Centre and Museum}at{Fairlynch House  
 at the end of the High Street.It has  
 lots of things to see such as the     
{Smugglers Cavern}in the original      
 cellars and the{Lace Exhibition}on the
 first floor.                          
 The house was built in 1810 and it was
 opened as a museum in 1967.About 8000 
 people visit Fairlynch each year.The  
 oldest exhibit is a stone age hammer  
 which was made about 22,000 years ago.
 The house is valued at a quarter of a 
 million pounds and the exhibits are of
 the same value.                       
 The Museum has got copies of the      
 painting of{The Boyhood of Raleigh    
 which was painted by John Millais when
 he stayed at the Octogon nearby in    
 1870.                                 </content>
