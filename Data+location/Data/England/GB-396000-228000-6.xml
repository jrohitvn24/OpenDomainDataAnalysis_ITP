 busiest day.The bakery uses seven tons

 own products.One hundred percent whole
 meal is the hardest bread to make.The 
 best selling bread is the sandwich    
 loaf.They bake about five thousand    
 rolls aweek and sell them to all the  
 other villages around as well as

 order has been for one thousand rolls.
 The most unusual order they have

 years.Door to door deliveries are
