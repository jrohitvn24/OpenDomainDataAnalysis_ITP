		<content> The new Bridgwater police station was 
 built in 1966.  There are 80 policemen
 and four policewomen. The policewomen 
 visit schools. There is one Chief     
 Inspector, four inspectors, one       
 superintendent, eleven sergeants      
 and a number of C.I.D. men.  In 1984  
 there were 3000 bicycles stolen.      
 There are not many robberies in shops 
 but there are a lot of burglaries.    
 Stray dogs are sometimes found and are
 put in the kennels at the station.    
 There are six cells, two for women and
 four for the men.  There is a low bed 
 for the drunks, the rest are high.    
 There are toilets which have their    
 flush outside in case the prisoners   
 damage them.  There is a yard outside 
 for the prisoners to exercise.  When  
 we went to the police station we had  
 our fingerprints taken.
