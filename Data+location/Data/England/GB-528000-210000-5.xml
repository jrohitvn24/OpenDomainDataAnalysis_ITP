      ________________________         
 All the pews were starting to         
 disintigrate,so Earl and Lady Cowper  
 paid for the church to be repaired.It 
 was literally rebuilt.The whole of the
 inside was taken out and rebuilt.     
 Before 1890,St.Mary's church,like most
 other churches in the district had a  
 spire  called a,Hertingfordbury spike,
 but when the church was rebuilt,the   
 Cowpers put a new copper spire over   
 the thin spike.When the organ has to  
 be cleaned it costs Â£5000.
