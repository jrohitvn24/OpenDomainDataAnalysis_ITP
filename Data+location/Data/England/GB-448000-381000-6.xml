		<title>06SHOPPING HABITS IN S. ANSTON</title>
		<content>   In June 1985 we did a shopping      
 survey in South Anston. We sent out   
 160 questionnaires to the parents of  
 children in our school. We got 63     
 replies. We found out that the average
 shopper is Mum and she travels by car 
 about 5 miles to Tesco, a hypermarket 
 in Worksop.  She spends 1 hour there  
 per week. She goes during the day     
 rather than the evening. Although it  
 is busy when she goes it does not     
 bother her. Working and car parking do
 not affect where she shops, but she   
 finds it easier to park in Worksop    
 than Sheffield, Rotherham and         
 Dinnington.                           
   She shops in Sheffield for clothes, 
 toys and furniture and in Worksop for 
 food. Sometimes she shops for food in 
 the Spar supermarket in South Anston, 
 where she finds the service friendly, 
 the shop clean but the prices high.   </content>
