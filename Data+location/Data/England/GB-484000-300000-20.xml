		<content> Through the middle of the study area  
 there is an East-West shallow valley  
 containing an unamed small stream,    
 which is 1-3m wide, slowly moving and 
 overgrown. It is a parish boundary    
 throughout its length,to the east     
 Ridlington-Ayston and to the west     
 Preston-Ayston. The stream disappears 
 in the west just south of Ridlington. 
   On the eastern margin of the study  
 area this stream passes under the     
 Glaston Road between Preston and Wing 
 Burrows. Very slightly to the west of 
 this point the parish boundary divides
 into three and all three branches pass
 eastward out of the area.             
   The stream may have orginally been  
 continuous with the Eye Brook which   
 currently deviates sharply southwards 
 at Allexton into the Eye Brook Valley;
 this is called{river capture.}
