		<content> Footpaths: A beautiful wooded path    
 goes from Barkla Shop through Jericho 
 Valley to the sea at Trevellas Coombe.
 The Coastal Footpath over the cliffs  
 passes the site of the old Wheal Kitty
 mine at Peterville.  Stippy-Stappy,   
 with its row of houses that look like 
 steps, leads past woods on one side   
 and Fairlight Glen on the other into  
 Quay Road, and so to the sea.         
 Climate: In summer a sea mist often   
 descends suddenly - then frequently   
 lifts to provide brilliant sunshine.  
 Winter is mild - mostly damp rather   
 than cold.  Easter is often warm.     
 Summer months lack rainfall, and (with
 the influx of visitors) drought       
 conditions are quickly reached.       
 Conservation: The National Trust owns 
 much of the area; and along with other
 organisations does much to keep the   
 countryside and its buildings safe.   </content>
