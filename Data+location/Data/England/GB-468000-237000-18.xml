The area is a bit of a wilderness as   
far as transport is concerned, a bus   
is a rare site, only 2 a day to Buck.  
On Saturdays, Paynes run a bus from    
Buck. to Northampton.  Nearest railway 
station is Bletchley getting to London 
Euston in 1 hour.  Old folk often use  
a taxi to visit doctor or dentist.     
The roads are not safe for cyclists,   
the A413 which cuts through this area  
is very winding, with nasty zig-zag    
bends by the Bull &amp; Butcher' in       
Akeley.  By the age of 17 young people 
are learning to drive, but before that 
get motorised cycles - what sort of    
social life can they have without      
wheels?
