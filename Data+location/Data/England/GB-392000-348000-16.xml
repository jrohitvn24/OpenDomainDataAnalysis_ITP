  In the area close to Werrington      
there is a large power station owned by
the Central Electricity Generating     
Board.                                 
  It takes power at 400,000 volts and  
130,000 volts and breaks it down before
providing the Midlands Electricity     
Board with a more managable level of   
power so they are able to provide the  
consumer with their 240 volts.         
  The station has 2 feeders one to the 
North which goes as far as Yorkshire   
and one to the South which stretchs    
down to the Trent Valley.The power goes
out on a pylon line which because of   
its position is prone to regular       
disruption from lightening.            
  Suprisingly power is provided for the
station by the M.E.B. and incase of a  
power failure the station has three    
diesel generators as a backup.         </content>
