		<content>   To the west of our study area lies  
 the edge of Tonbridge.The housing here
 is quite modern nearly all being built
 this century.There are detached,semi- 
 detached and terraced houses,bungalows
 and a few flats.Some are privately    
 owned and some are council houses     
 belonging to the local authority.     
   In Hadlow and Golden Green the      
 housing is again a mixture of private 
 and local authority.Unlike the        
 Tonbridge area a number of these      
 houses are quite old.The environmental
 architectural and historic importance 
 of Hadlow was recognised by the local 
 authority who designated a large part 
 of it as a conservation area.         
   Our area has a number of unusual    
 buildings that have been or are being 
 converted into homes including a      
 chapel,barns,oast houses,a brewery    
 and even a castle.                    </content>
