		<title>12Ore White Mill(Cheales Mill)</title>
		<content>          {The Mill is next door to our
{school on The Ridge.Now there is only 
{a little bit}left.Mr. and Mrs.        
 Cornelius look after the Mill.They    
 are not allowed to pull it down       
 because if they do people won't have  
 anything old to look at. The base of  
 the Mill is a workshop now. Mr.       
 Cornelius and his brother buy old     
 cars,mend them and spray them.Then    
 they sell them .In the workshop there 
 is some paint and some tools.The base 
 of the Mill is an octagon.Each side   
 measures about three metres. We       
 estimated the height to the top of    
 the wall.It was three metres and about
 four metres to the top of the roof.We 
 think the whole smock mill measured   
 about nine metres{.The Mill was burnt 
{down on 16th May 1900. We visited the 
{Mill on 16th May 1985, exactly 85     
{years later.         By class 7.      </content>
