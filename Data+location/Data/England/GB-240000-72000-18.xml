		<title>18Fishing-Trout and Salmon</title>
		<content> The{fishing rights}on the Tamar river 
 from New Bridge to Horsebridge are    
{owned privately by two parties}but    
{jurisdiction over the water is held by
 the{S.W.Water Authority.}Once,there   
 was a good stock of{salmon}and{brown  
{trout.}Now {pollution from household  
{waste}and{chemical fertilizers}appears
 to have had a{damaging effect on the  
{numbers of fish.Poaching}for salmon is
 now carried out in a more organized   
 way.{Water bailiffs are employed}and  
 their many duties include general     
 maintenance of river banks as well as 
 checking fishermen for licences. They 
 are empowered to stop, search and     
 arrest if necessary. Birds, such as   
{kingfishers, dippers and herons}are to
 be found along the river.As for       
 mammals, there has been{a significant 
{increase in the number of mink but no 
{sign of otters in recent years.       </content>
