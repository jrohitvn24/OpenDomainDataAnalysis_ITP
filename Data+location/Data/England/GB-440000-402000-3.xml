		<title>03The Miner's Strike 1984/85</title>
		<content> In February we put our house up for   
 sale. But in March the Miner's Strike 
 began. We would never sell our house  
 now and my dad was on picket duty.    
 I didn't get new toys and my parents  
 missed out too. My dad was rarely home
 and when he came he went to bed       
 because he was extremely tired.       
   When Christmas came I was not       
 expecting much but I got a Â£130 BMX   
 bicycle. When my birthday arrived I   
 got new clothes, a computer game and  
 money. My dad used to tell me stories 
 about how the police nearly caught him
 on the picket lines but he always got 
 away. February '85 came and went      
 without incident and then came the    
 anniversary in March. The Unions were 
 desperately trying to get a           
 settlement.The end of the strike      
 enabled us to lead a normal life      
 again.                                </content>
