		<title>19ECOLOGY OF THE WEM BROOK</title>
		<content> The Wem Brook flows from south to     
 north through our area before joining 
 the River Anker. In the south of our  
 area the Wem Brook is very narrow as  
 it is very near its source. It wends  
 through farmland for much of its      
 course. It is possible to follow the  
 brook and even cross it by footbridge 
 for much of its course as a public    
 footpath runs by it. In places there  
 is a great variety of wild plant life 
 on its banks. As the brook nears its  
 confluence with the Anker it flows    
 through The Pingles Sports Complex. We
 worked out the rate of flow of the    
 brook as it went through The Pingles- 
 it was 9,000 litres per minute. Many  
 different trees grow on the banks of  
 The Wem. These are some               
 Elderbery ,Sycamore ,Weeping Willow,  
 Alder,Hawthorn, Ash and Horse         
 Chestnut.                             </content>
