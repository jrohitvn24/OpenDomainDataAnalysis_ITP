		<title>16WOODLAND IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> Although there are no large woods in  
 this area there are many small stands 
 of trees.In the valley the trees tend 
 to be deciduous whereas on the hills  
 conifers predominate.Many of the      
 stands of trees in the area are now   
 approaching maturity.These were       
 planted about 40 tears ago to provide 
 shelter for steadings in the valley or
 for the animals on the hills.Trees    
 also follow the river ,these tend to  
 be Alder.Ingram village is situated in
 a wooded area.These woods are         
 deciduous and contain sycamore        
 ,horse-chestnuts,ash and some         
 oak.These are also mature woods.As    
 some of the older conifers are felled 
 they are being replaced by new areas  
 of trees.
