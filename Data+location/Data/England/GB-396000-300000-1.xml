		<title>01General survey of area.</title>
		<content> This area includes several distinct   
 communities such as New Invention,    
 Short Heath,Bloxwich and Leamore.It   
 is highly residential bordering upon  
 the town of Willenhall in the south   
 and the agricultural area of Essington
 in the north.It is an area of         
 declining industry;many factories are 
 being demolished and there is an      
 unemployment rate of 20%.The          
 population is multicultural with      
 communities of Asian and West Indian  
 origin.The area is cut in two by the  
 M6 Motorway and also includes the     
 Wyrley and Essington Canal.Many of the
 schools in the area are suffering from
 declining rolls,some facing closure.  
 The area includes the boundary between
 Wolverhampton and Walsall.
