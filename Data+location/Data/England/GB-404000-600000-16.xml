		<content> Many young people go to the Rothbury  
 Sports Club which is a well organised 
 place with lots of facilities.        
 There is a choice of                  
 snooker,pool,football, badminton,     
 weight training, gymnastics, tennis   
 and cricket.                          
 At the beginning of the year it costs 
 three pounds for membership then each 
 time you go it costs only twenty five 
 pence. If you are not a member it     
 costs one pound for each visit.  There
 is a regular disco night for children 
 aged 9 to 16 and it is from 1900 hrs. 
 to 2200 hrs. during the summer months.
 The disco is on a Friday night night  
 and I like to leave with my friends at
 2100 hrs. and get some chips to eat in
 the park. There is also a dance for   
 older people but it does not finish   
 until very late.
