		<content>{Pickering Smallholders and Allotments 
{Association}started in 1908 and today 
 has 80 plots at an annual rent of     
 Â£2.The recent increase is to pay for  
 piped water.                          
{Demand}for plots is high.12 names are 
 on the waiting list,a number only once
 exceeded in the past.Many ladies have 
 now joined.                           
 The Council,to whom rents are paid,are
 very helpful.An increase in the number
 of plots is not felt necessary as it  
 is desirable to have a{waiting list}so
 that space is taken up as soon as it  
 becomes available.                    
 Most gardeners have allotments either 
 because they enjoy home-grown         
 vegetables or because they have flower
 beds in their gardens at home and     
 prefer to grow food elsewhere. Many   
 are very enthusiastic and enter their 
 produce in local shows.               </content>
