		<title>02Shops in Deal</title>
		<content> On Thursday, 23rd May 1985, Class 3   
 went with our teacher and some mums to
 count the different shops in the{main 
{shopping area}of Deal. We called it   
 "shop-spotting". Some shops are closed
 down, but there are some new ones.    
                                       
 The{High Street}was once called{Lower 
{Street}because it was low lying. Many 
 years ago several of the shops in the 
 High Street and{Middle Street}had     
 steps leading down to them. We saw a  
{fashion shop}which had been a theatre 
 at one time. One group saw a man in a 
{hairdresser's salon}who was having a  
 pink and green striped{punk rocker    
 hair style.                           
                                       
 Marke saw a lovely big mirror in an   
{antique shop.}It had a horse and      
 writing on it. He thought it cost     
 Â£1.05, but it really cost Â£105.00 !   </content>
