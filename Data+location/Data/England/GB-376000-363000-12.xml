		<title>12Jayne Allens Weekend.</title>
		<content>          My name is Jayne Allen and   
  it was 9.00am. on a typical Saturday 
 morning,as I reluctantly climbed out  
 of bed I heard my Mum shout me for    
 breakfast.I didn't exactly want any   
 breakfast but it wasn't entirely up to
 me,so I got changed and went down. I  
 had my breakfast that consisted of    
 cereal and toast,I finished by 9.30am.
 I had just got upstairs when my Mum   
 reminded me we had to go to West Heath
 for the weeks shopping.So I grabbed my
 jacket and purse and went back        
 downstairs.I climbed into my Mums Fiat
 Panda (I was happy because I had got  
 out of the washing up).We drove to the
 shops and did all the shopping,which  
 took quite a while.We finally arrived 
 home again (loaded up)at about 12.30pm
 We unpacked about five carrier-bags   
 while Dad made us all some lunch and  
 did some other jobs as well.          </content>
