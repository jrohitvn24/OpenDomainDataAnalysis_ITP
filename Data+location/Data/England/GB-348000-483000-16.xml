		<content> In l704 and again in l906, fire       
 damaged parts of the building.        
 Re-wiring was carried out in l982     
 together with re-roofing of the south 
 wing and dry rot was cured in l985.   
                                       
 During the Summer months there are 33 
 staff made up of estate workers,      
 gardners, administrative and kitchen  
 staff and guides.                     
                                       
 Nearly l60,000 people pay to visit the
 Hall each year which, together with   
 Government grants help to maintain    
 Levens Hall, primarily as the private 
 home of the Bagot family, but secondly
 as an outstanding example of an       
 English Country house steeped in      
 history.
