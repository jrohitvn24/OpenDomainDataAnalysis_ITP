		<title>11The River Stour</title>
		<content>The river runs through the centre of   
our area. It meanders across flat grass
land. It is suitable for walking beside
and there are many fish to be seen     
along with some interesting plant      
life. The old mill and its wheel have  
been preserved. Some children think    
that the river is polluted with a      
large amount of rubbish being dumped in
it quite regularly. Some people do     
manage to fish from the waters. The    
river passes by two major factories in 
the area and flows on northwards       
through Canterbury and out to Sandwich 
Bay.
