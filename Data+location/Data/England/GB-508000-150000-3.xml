		<content> Sheepleas is an area of land owned by 
 Surrey County Council &amp; designated an 
 Open Space &amp; Country Park.  There is a
 good variety of trees, mainly beech,  
 some of which are very old.  Acer,    
 Sycamore, Ash, Pine, Rowan, Oak &amp;     
 Holly were seen, also two distinct    
 avenues of yew which must have been   
 planted but it is not clear why.  One 
 area may have been part of a garden,  
 as various shrubs were growing,privet,
 weigelia, box, cupressus &amp; dogwood.   
 Squirrels &amp; rabbits were seen, also   
 damage done by gnawing at tree bark.  
 There were many thrushes &amp; blackbirds 
 &amp; a large badgers' sett.  We listed 33
 varieties of wild flowers blooming in 
 in July.  Rarest is the orchid which  
 is at its best then.  In one meadow   
 the purple spotted orchid was very    
 prolific &amp; we saw several deeper pur- 
 ple Pyramidar &amp; Twayblade orchids.    </content>
