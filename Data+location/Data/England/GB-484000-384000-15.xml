		<content> Upton is a well to do village and     
 we discovered that lots of people who 
 live there go to work in Lincoln or   
 Gainsborough.We decided to use the    
 computer to see how many people owned 
 their own homes and we came up with   
 these results.                        
                                       
 Homes owner occupied:72%              
 Council tenants     :14%              
 Privately rented    :14%              
 These figures show the number of      
 people living in different types of   
 houses.                               
 We also discoverd that 83% of all the 
 households n the village had a car and
 that male unemployment was 6%.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
