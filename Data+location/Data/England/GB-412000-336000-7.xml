		<content> We looked at the reasons why people   
 travel out of Marston.Shopping was the
 first.They went to                    
 Uttoxeter,Ashbourne,Derby and Sinfin. 
 The second reason was for             
 entainment.Apart from visiting local  
 pubs and the village hall social club,
 people visited friends and to swimming
 clubs in Ashbourne and Uttoxeter.One  
 of our samples went to concerts at the
 Abbotsholme Arts Society.For their    
 exercise they went to                 
 Ashbourne,Uttoxeter and Rugeley       
 swimming and some walked and cycled   
 and did Aerobics at Uttoxeter and     
 Hatton school.Those who work out of   
 the village travel to                 
 Ashbourne,Derby,Uttoxeter and Hixon   
 near Stafford.Most people we asked    
 where people bought their last car.We 
 decided "locally"meant any-where      
 within 7 miles.                       </content>
