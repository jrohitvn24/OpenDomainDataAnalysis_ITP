		<title>09The Port Isaac Lifeboat</title>
		<content> The present lifeboat has been in Port 
 Isaac since 1967 when the Blue Peter  
 progamme collected money, sent it in  
 and bought Port Isaac and other towns 
 a lifeboat.The lifeboat has been out  
 226 times on rescue missions and it   
 has rescued or saved people 126 times,
 John's main reason for joining was    
 that he wanted to put something back  
 into the village.He also enjoyed being
 part of a team and liked the spirit of
 when they're all working together and 
 the fact that they're doing something 
 good for some one else for a change.  
 Every winter they have a meeting      
 on Monday nights where they all get   
 together and have first aid training  
 raidio,coastal recognition and lots   
 more.They have at least 6 practices at
 sea in the summer.
