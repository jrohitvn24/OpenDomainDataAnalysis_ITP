 Last year in 1984 the mill at the     
 bottom of Fall Lane was burnt down.   
 It crushed Marsden roller skating     
 club.at the moment they are knocking  
 down the mill on Carr's Road to make  
 fifty houses.                         
 Tomorrow 29th June 1985 there will be 
 a festival for the Community          
 Association.It will be held in the    
 Infant's school yard and in the car   
 park next to it.the majorettes will be
 marching and you will be able to throw
 custard pies at them. Last week the   
 majorettes had three events to go to  
 finishing with an appearence at the   
 bowling match in the park on Sunday.  
 The cubs are going to Thurstone Hall  
 on Sunday and the brownies are going  
 to Scarborough.
