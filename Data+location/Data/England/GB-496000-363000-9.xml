		<content>   The Waddington W.I. meets the second
 Wednesday of each month (except       
 August) at 7.30 pm at the Village     
 Hall. It is a place where women can   
 meet, make friends and entertain.     
   The members organise jumble sales   
 and raise money for charity. They have
 recently brought two wheelchairs for  
 the village.                          
   The members play tennis, golf, darts
 and go riding. At Christmas they go to
 the Grand Hotel. In the Church Hall   
 they sing carols and have parties.    
   Sometimes they have poetry days.    
   The W.I. has talks to educate       
 members and give advice on baby care. 
   They cook and swap recipes.         
   Waddington W.I.has 55 members and   
 has won the shield for the best run   
 institute in Lincolnshire for the past
 two years. The subscription is Â£4 and 
 coffee is 10p. The minimum age is 14. </content>
