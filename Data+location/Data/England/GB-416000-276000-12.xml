		<title>12A Walk in Knowle</title>
		<content>     A walk from Kixley Lane to Hampton
 Road, Knowle. July 1st 1985.          
     Over the stile we followed the    
 footpath and explored the fields. The 
 sun was shining. It was long and full 
 of flowers. We saw purple and white   
 Clover, Ox-eye Daisies and Buttercups 
 which we held under our chins to see  
 if we liked butter. We saw Holly Blue 
 Butterflies fluttering and Bumble Bees
 buzzing around the flowers and shiny  
 red Ladybirds with seven black spots  
 on thier backs. Swallows were swooping
 low in the sky looking for insects to 
 eat. It was very quiet but we heard   
 the other children in the distance    
 playing in the school playground and a
 pigeon cooing in the trees. We looked 
 at the hedge and counted 4 kinds of   
 trees, Ash, Oak, Hazel and Hawthorn   
 and we calculated that the hedge has  
 been growing for 400 years.           </content>
