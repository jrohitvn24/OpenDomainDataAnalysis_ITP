		<content> Most houses in the village are built  
 of brick from around 1890.The         
 bricks came from a{brickyard}in the   
 village: the village actually         
 developed around this{industry.       
 We found that many of the villagers   
 had lived there all their lives,80yrs 
 in some cases.Many{extended families  
 live in the village.                  
 The important changes include the     
{closure of the village school}despite 
 protests and numerous meetings and the
 development of a new housing estate   
 called Ingleside.
