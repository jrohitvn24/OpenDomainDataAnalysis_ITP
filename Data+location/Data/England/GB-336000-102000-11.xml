		<content> Residents of Thorncombe rceive health 
 protection from doctors in Chard,     
 Beaminster and Exminster.  Chard      
 doctors visit the village twice       
 weekly.  Dentists, Oculists, Clinics  
 and Hospitals visits have to be made  
 either by transport liad on by the    
 health authority or by private car.   
 Hospitals for severe illnesses or     
 maternity cases are in Taunton, Yeovil
 and Dorchester, as are most other     
 facilities necessary for health       
 checks.  The village bobby has been   
 replaced by a weekly visit from the   
 mobile policeman in his police car.   
 The local joke is that the lawbreakers
 take Monday off when the bobby comes  
 to the village.  He is available to   
 all who need his help and reassurance 
 and in his half hour's stay calls on a
 few elderly folk and the shops.  Two  
 of our residents are special          </content>
