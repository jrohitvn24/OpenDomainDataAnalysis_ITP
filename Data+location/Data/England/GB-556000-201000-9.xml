		<content>   Traffic from Chelmsford to Chipping 
 Ongar used to drive through High Ongar
 Village,but there were several minor  
 accidents due to lorries shedding     
 there loads on the sharp bends.In 1980
 a by-pass (A414) was opened and this  
 changed the village into a peaceful   
 area.It has,however,meant less passing
 trade.The garage no longer sells      
 petrol and the newspaper shop has     
 closed.There is a bus service         
 connecting High Ongar to Chipping     
 Ongar and Chelmsford.The first bus    
 leaves the village at 6.23am and the  
 last at 7.05pm Monday to              
 Friday.During the day,there can       
 often be a gap of two hours between   
 services.The last bus on a Saturday   
 from Chelmsford is 5.05pm.Therefore it
 is impossible for local people to rely
 on public transport for easy access to
 other towns and villages.             </content>
