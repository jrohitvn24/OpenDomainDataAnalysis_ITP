 The hall was built in 1934 and is run 
 by a small committee. It is hired     
 frequently by many village groups -   
 the Womens Institute, the Friendship  
 Club for the over-sixties, and a      
 weekly Folk Dance Group.  Parish      
 Council Meetings are held there, and  
 the Stibbard Players use it for       
 rehearsals and their two annual       
 performances.  A Junior Drama group   
 also meets and performs there.        
 Villagers celebrate their Silver      
 Weddings in the hall or hold their    
 Christening Parties there.  The school
 used the hall for two years for       
 physical education, until suitable    
 space was provided at the school      
 itself. For three years an annual     
 party of schoolboy pilgrims on its way
 to Walsingham Shrine has spent a night
 in sleeping bags on the hall floor.   </content>
