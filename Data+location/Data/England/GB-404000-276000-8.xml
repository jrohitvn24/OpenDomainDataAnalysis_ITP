		<content>Our school and homes are powered by    
electricity and gas.Eletricity comes   
along insulated cables underground     
from the national grid.There is a sub- 
station.In the infant playground.The   
supply to the rural parts of our area  
is by over head cables carried on      
pylons.These are marked on the 25"map. 
Electricity is generated at power stat-
ions using coal or nuclear fuel.Our    
nearest power station is Hams Hall     
which is coal fired.Natural gas comes  
from the North Sea.It is piped under-  
ground from the rings to our homes in  
yellow plastic pipes.We use gas for    
central heating boilers, gas fires     
cookers and some refrigerators and     
freezers.Electricity powers many more  
appliances: cookers,waterheaters,fires 
televisions,computer,lamp,electric bla-
nkets,kettles,mixers and a record      
players  By Teresa Shiels,Sir Theodore.</content>
