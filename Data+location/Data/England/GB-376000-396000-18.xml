		<content> Housing north of the motorway is a    
 mixture of Victorian terraces (794    
 987) and (797 987) and local authority
 houses built in the 1930's. A few     
 houses have been built post-war. The  
 area south of the M602 has been       
 cleared for redevelopment houses here 
 have not yet been built. Many of the  
 houses have small gardens in front    
 with hedges. They have bay-windows and
 yards at the back. In general, they   
 are in a good state of repair and well
 painted.                              
 The Weaste trading estate has been    
 built on the site of an old cotton    
 mill and twelve small firms making    
 light metal goods occupy nearby       
 factory buildings. South of Eccles New
 Road towards the canal there is       
 another industrial zone with a large  
 Wimpy (builders) depot and a          
 Lancashire Tar Distillers depot.      </content>
