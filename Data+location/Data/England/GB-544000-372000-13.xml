		<title>13Changes in the Alford area</title>
		<content>    The most noticable changes have    
 been in farming techniques. The       
 farm labourers'cottages at Well are   
 now the homes for retired couples     
 especially from London. Farms have    
 amalgamated, now growing oilseed rape.
    The number of privately owned cars 
 has greatly increased;allowing workers
 to commute to work e.g. in nearby     
 Louth.                                
    Leisure time has also tended to    
 increase, although people in the      
 study area were generally dissatisfied
 with the facilities available.        
    The questionnaire showed that the  
 people were less superstitious and    
 religious, with falling attendances at
 many churches, especially a decline in
 the number of families who celebrated 
 Harvest Festival, an indication of the
 falling importance of agriculture as  
 employment in this area.              </content>
