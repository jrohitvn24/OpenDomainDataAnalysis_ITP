		<title>16The Derby Arms at Thornley</title>
		<content> The Derby Arms was formerly a coaching
 house and is now a restaurant and     
 public house employing some 20        
 persons, mostly local and casual.     
 The manager is resident and there is  
 no provision for employing young      
 persons on one of the government      
 schemes.   The work force is provided 
 with transport due to the absence of  
 an adequate bus service.              
                                       
 The restaurant provides a venue for   
 wedding receptions and discos.   The  
 public bars cater for a small number  
 of regular local people and during the
 Summer months people from the         
 surrounding areas motor out for an    
 evening drink and perhaps a bar snack.
