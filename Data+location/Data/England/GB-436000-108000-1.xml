		<title>01GENERAL SURVEY,MARCHWOOD</title>
		<content> The area mostly consists of           
 agricultural land,and is used mainly  
 for {dairy farming.}Some quite large  
 areas of woodland are found, mainly   
 in the far North West and South East  
 corners.A small corner of the New     
 Forest extends into the area,mostly   
 consisting of well grazed rough       
 grassland.                            
      Most of the population live in   
 the village of{Marchwood...about 4000 
 in 1985.It is not a very old          
 village.The oldest building is a farm 
 which dates from the early 17th       
 century.The village is growing rapidly
 and a new shopping centre is being    
 built to serve the several new        
 estates.                              
       A small corner of the much older
 village of Dibden is in the far South 
 of the area.It includes the old       
 medieval church.                      </content>
