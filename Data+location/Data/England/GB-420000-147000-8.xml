		<content>  Three pre-school playgroups cater for
 approximately 200 children aged 3 to 5
 years,involving them in play and      
 learning activities. The schools are  
 Clarendon Infant School,222 pupils    
 aged 5 to 7; Clarendon Junior School, 
 250 pupils aged 7 to 11; Zouch Primary
 School,332 pupils aged 5 to 11. All of
 these are in Wiltshire. The Hampshire 
 area has the Tidworth Church of       
 England Primary School with 91 pupils 
 aged 5 to 11,also a Nursery Unit for  
 21 children. The schoolchildren are   
 encouraged to participate in local    
 community work. There is no Secondary 
 Education in Tidworth so the older    
 children attend schools outside this  
 area. Two Army Education Centres help 
 prepare Officers and Soldiers for     
 promotion. They teach languages and,  
 with Salisbury Technical College,     
 provide various evening classes.      </content>
