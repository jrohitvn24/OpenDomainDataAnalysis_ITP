     As this is an agricultural area   
 there is very little industry in the  
 block.There is one shop in Holton     
 village which is a Post Office and    
 General Store.Most customers come from
  the village but they also get some   
 passing trade.                        
   As well as the shop a fish man and a
 butcher visit the village once a week 
 and a library van comes once a        
 fortnight.                            
   In the late 1970's the Oak side     
 cattery was founded by Mr. and        
 Mrs.Horton.It is situated behind the  
 Hope Tavern and is open 24 hours and  
 12 months a year.
