		<title>01Landscape - West Oxfordshire</title>
		<content>The landscape is gentle and lazily     
hilly with a few small deciduous       
woods. Dotted around the countryside   
are sleepy villages with little        
activity.                              
Narrow roads criss cross the area.     
Quite a lot of the minor roads are     
hardly used at all because no one has  
any need for them. It is a peaceful,   
quiet place, except on the B4022 which 
is quite busy but not with enough cars 
for a traffic jam.                     
The main business is the farming of    
crops such as rape, wheat, barley,     
maize and beans. It is not an          
industrial place because it is in the  
countryside. If there was a factory you
would have to take your products a long
way to sell them.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
