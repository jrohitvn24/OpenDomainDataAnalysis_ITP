		<content> This was once a coal merchants and the
 horse and cart would pass through the 
 arch to the yard at the back.         
   The King &amp; Queen is a very old pub. 
 It is not known after which monarchs  
 it was named. Historians made a "dig" 
 behind the pub before a car park was  
 made. Pieces of pottery from{MIDDLE   
{AGES}were found. A row of cottages    
 named Roffey Place used to stand next 
 to the village jewellers. E.B. Butlers
 shop was built on the site. Nearly    
 opposite the old Rectory stood 3      
 cottages, one of which was the old    
 bakery. Only one cottage still        
 remains.                              
   The{OLD RECTORY,}now called{CEDAR   
{HOUSE}is said to be haunted by the    
 ghost of a little girl. Outside is a  
 CEDAR TREE  about 250 years old. It is
 said that if you talk under this tree 
 you will have a{CURSE}put on you.     </content>
