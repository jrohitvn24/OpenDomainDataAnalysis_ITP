		<title>18 FIRE STATION KETTERING</title>
		<content>                                       
The station, built in 1955 employs 30  
full time and 16 part time men.        
Training consists of 14 weeks'         
basic. 0ne year trial and a further 4  
years. Each man does daily fire drill. 
There are 2 fire engines, 1 water      
tender and an hydraulic platform. When 
called to a fire by a bleeper alarm,   
it takes 1 minute to get into an       
engine. On the way they change into    
fire gear and radio a doctor if        
medical help is required. They add to  
the 18,000l.of water carried by        
drawing from the mains in the streets  
and also use dry powder, carbon        
dioxide and foam. In 1984 there were   
517 fires put out in the area. Most    
were at night and caused by            
carelessness. In the case of very big  
fires, they have travelled up to 60    
miles.                                 </content>
