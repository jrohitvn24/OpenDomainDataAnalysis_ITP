		<content> On a week day, rise to the alarm at   
 05.40, shower, dress and leave the    
 house.  For my present job, drive 70  
 miles to work which takes less than 90
 minutes using motorway and the        
 Dartford Tunnel.  Sign the security   
 book, brew up a pot of coffee and have
 breakfast whilst reviewing the days   
 work, providing a Civil Engineering   
 input to a new project.               
                                       
 Work until 16.30 or later if meeting  
 necessetates, with a half hour break  
 for lunch.  Drive home arriving about 
 18.00.  Sometimes early enough to     
 collect the children from Guides or   
 other activities.  Have dinner and    
 spend sometime with the children. Read
 the newspaper and watch the news on   
 T.V., feed goldfish, cover budgie and 
 put the dog out.  Then spend some time
 with my computer before bed at 23.00. </content>
