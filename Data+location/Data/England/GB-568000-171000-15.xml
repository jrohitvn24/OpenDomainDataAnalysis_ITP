		<title>15  HIGHAM PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Higham school was built in 1847 and   
 has recently been extended in order to
 cater for the growing population of   
 the village. There are now 212        
 children at Higham school. There are  
 seven classes now compared with one   
 class when the school was first built.
 The school used to have a P.T.A but   
 this has recently become an           
 "association of friends".             
   Music plays a very big part within  
 the school. Rehearsals for the        
 regional choir festival are held there
 each year and many of the pupils at   
 the school have special tuition in    
 violin, recorders and cello.          
  The school is in an attractive       
 country setting and attracts children 
 from a large area.
