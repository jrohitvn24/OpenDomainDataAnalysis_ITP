		<title>06FARMING IN THE RIB VALLEY.</title>
		<content> The Rib valley is predominately farm  
 land. Today this is mainly arable     
 farming,with a little pasture. Farming
 in the area,is dominated by a few very
 large farms. Most of these were part  
 of old estates,which have since become
 split up. For example,{"Home Farm"}   
 takes its' name from the time when 1  
 land-lord owned 8 farms,7 of which    
 were rented out. The 8th farm he lived
 at himself,hence the name{"HOME"}farm.
 The fields in the valley tend to be   
 very large and intensively farmed.    
 Many of the fields have been enlarged 
 by the removal of some old hedgerows. 
 Wheat,barley and oil-seed rape are the
 most common crops and a great deal of 
 machinery is used.{"Ashridge Common"} 
 near Cold Christmas,has never had an  
 enclosure order,hence it is called a  
 common. However,today this land has   
 been split up and is used for crops.  </content>
