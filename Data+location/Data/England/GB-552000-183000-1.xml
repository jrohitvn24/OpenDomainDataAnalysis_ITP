		<content> A QUESTIONAIRE BY ANDREW DELLBRIDGE   
 Q. What is your opinion of the area?  
 A. I like the area as its on the      
 border of the Greater London Area and 
 is close to the coast and countryside.
  It is also a pleasant place to live.

 area?                                 
 A. Three years.                       
 Q. Why did you move here?             
 A. I moved from Romford because I     
 wanted a new house, I liked the look  
 of Hornchurch and it has an           
 underground station.                  
 Q. Has the area changed in any way and
 if so how?                            
 A. There are many new housing estates 
 being built.                          
 Q. Do you use the local shops more    
 than the big supermarkets?            
 A. No we use the big supermarket      
 mainly.                               </content>
