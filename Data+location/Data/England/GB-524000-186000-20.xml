		<content> ALEX 8yrs: My street is very quiet.   
 Not many cars come up it so I{cycle}on
 the road. I live right behind Golders 
 Green Crematorium. Once a year, in the
 summer, the Salvation Army come and   
 play in our road. Everybody comes     
 pouring up our road but we don't have 
 to move. All we have to do is open the
 front window and listen. Sometimes my 
 friend Ryusuke comes and plays with me
 on my{computer.}We play Aviator which 
 is a simulator{program.}You have to   
 pilot a Spitfire through difficult    
 feats but I am not very good. One     
 game I play in the school playground  
 is{football.}We have small matches    
 against each other. We don't use a    
 real football, but what we normally   
 use is a tennis-ball. We use benches  
 as goals. To score a goal you have to 
 get the ball under the bench. Some-   
 times we kick the ball over the fence.</content>
