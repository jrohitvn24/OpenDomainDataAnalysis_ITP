   Sports' Club by Joseph.             
   I belong to Henfield Boys' Sports'  
 Club which does things like football  
 and cricket.  I am in the under 10s   
 team.  It is good fun practising      
 tactics and skills.  We practice at   
 the Rothery and the King's Field.  We 
 play in a mini-minor league and play  
 home and away matches. It is good fun.
