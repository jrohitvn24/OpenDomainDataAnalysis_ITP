		<title>20Domesday - Final Comment.</title>
		<content>    This project has been undertaken by
 the following people all of whom work 
 and learn at John Mason School in     
 Abingdon - a small group of 3rd year  
 pupils, a 6th former with computer    
 knowledge, a 4th former from a D-block
 village and several teachers.         
    Everybody concerned have thoroughly
 enjoyed the project and we are        
 convinced that it has increased our   
 knowledge of the area in which we     
 live.
