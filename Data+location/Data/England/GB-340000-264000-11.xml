		<title>11AYMESTREY VILLAGE SHOP</title>
		<content>   The village{Post Office}and shop    
 occupy the lower part of a building   
 with living premises above,built 6yrs 
 ago to replace a lock-up shop.        
   The owner is a native of the county 
 and runs the shop with the aid of two 
 part-time staff.                      
   The shop is open five and a half    
 days a week,{Mon to Fri -8.30 to 5.30 
 and{Sat morning.}Most of the trade is 
 with locals but there is a good       
 passing trade.                        
   It sells staple goods and a great   
 variety of other goods. Off-licence   
 sales include French and German wines,
 and of course local ciders.           
   It is much more than a shop - it is 
 one of the centres of social life of  
 the village where contacts can be     
 maintained, news passed and messages  
 left for friends. The village would   
 lose its character without a shop.    </content>
