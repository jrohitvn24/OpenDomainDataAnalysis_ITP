		<title>08Local fetes</title>
		<content>  Each summer,fetes are held in most of
 the local villages in the area.They   
 are based on the idea of the          
 traditional medieval village fair.They
 include many stalls selling locally   
 made produce as well as sideshows,    
 games,competitions,fancy dress,food   
 and drink stands,promotional          
 enterprises,livestock shows etc.      
  They have both a economical and      
 social value as meeting places and    
 market centres.They are held on       
 separate weekends,often at a school or
 church, to avoid clashing with a      
 neighbouring fete.
