		<title>01Hatfield Broad Oak, Essex.</title>
		<content>   Our 12 square kilometre area is     
 predominantly arable farmland with    
 small areas of woodland and meadow.   
 However, the focal point for the      
 surrounding countryside is the        
 picturesque and ancient village of    
 Hatfield Broad Oak, which lies in the 
 south-eastern section of the area.    
                                       
   The village has not always been     
 called Hatfield Broad Oak. At the time
 of the first Domesday survey it was   
 Hatfelda. From the 12th to the 17th   
 centuries it was known as Hatfield    
 Villa Regis or Hatfield Domini Regis  
 but from the 17th century it has had  
 its present name. This derives from a 
 particularly large and old oak tree in
 nearby Hatfield Forest which  last    
 bore green leaves in the year 1859 and
 finally disappeared in 1924. A plaque 
 still marks its site.                 </content>
