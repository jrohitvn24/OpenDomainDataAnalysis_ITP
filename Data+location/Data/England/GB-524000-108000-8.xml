		<title>08HANG GLIDING</title>
		<content> Hang gliding began in the 1970's.At   
 first people lost their lives in this 
 sport.Today you don't hear of people  
 being killed so often because people  
 are more skilled at it.A hang glider  
 is a metal frame to support large     
 nylon wings and a harness to carry the
 pilot.The pilot can manoeuvre the     
 glider to some extent.In Brighton,the 
 north side of the{Devils Dyke}is      
 favoured by most pilots in South East 
 England. To start flying you have to  
 catch the wind off the hill which is  
 called the rising current.On any      
 weekend when the weather is favourable
 the sky over the{Dyke}is filled with  
 hangliders.
