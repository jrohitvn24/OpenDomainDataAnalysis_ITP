		<title>06   The Mill at Coleford</title>
		<content> On Wednesday 22nd May we visited the  
 old {Coleford Mill.    }The mill was  
 built in 1794. When we went inside we 
 saw all the bottles which were found  
 in the {mill race.}There were forty   
 two bottles and almost a complete clay
 pot. A lady showed  us the {bread oven
 which  was one and a half metres wide 
 and two metres long. They used to use 
 hazel twigs to warm up the oven. They 
 lit the twigs and when the twigs had  
 been burnt they put the bread in.     
      We saw an old fireplace where    
 people used to hang meat to keep it   
 fresh.  We saw some hand made nails   
 which were very old.                  
   The whole Mill took up three floors.
 We saw the other side  of the wheel.  
 We found out it was an{undershot mill.
  We went outside and saw the hatches. 
 When they were wound down the water   
 would build  up and start the wheel.  </content>
