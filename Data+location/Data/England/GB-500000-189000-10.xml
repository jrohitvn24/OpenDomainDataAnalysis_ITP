		<title>10Change in Chalfont St.Peter.</title>
		<content>   I interviewed 20 people but only a  
few had been in Chalfont St.Peter for  
over 30 years.All said in the last 10  
to 15 years the character of the       
village has changed.There has been a   
greater movement of people moving in   
and out due to job situations and      
family conditions.                     
   The village was tranquil with few   
roads and shops.There was more a       
feeling of togetherness amongst the    
people living then.They were all known 
to each other and all {festivals} and  
{functions} were attended by all.      
   But due to modern circumstances,more
people, cars, roads and companies the  
character has changed.There are new    
roads,{A413} where once stood fields,  
new roundabouts.there are new shops    
even supermarkets.The boom in {housing}
estates means that more estate agents  
are cropping up.                       </content>
