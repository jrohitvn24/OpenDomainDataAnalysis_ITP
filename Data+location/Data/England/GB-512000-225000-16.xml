		<title>16SOCIAL CONCERNS IN OFFLEY.</title>
		<content> PUBLIC TRANSPORT.Many people in Offley
 have asked the local bus company to   
 provide a more frequent bus service   
 for them.At present only some of the  
 buses travelling from Luton to Hitchin
 are routed through the village others 
 go via the bypass.The Parish Council  
 have written supporting this request  
 the bus company considers the present 
 service adequate they have however    
 agreed not to procede with their plans
 to further reduce the service.        
                                       
 PARKING IN THE VILLAGE HIGH STREET.It 
 has been requested that cars should   
 not be allowed to park on both sides  
 of this street as it is exceedingly   
 narrow and it is a great inconvenience
 to the residents.The public houses do 
 provide car parks but these are not   
 adequate.The police have been asked to
 investigate this problem.             </content>
