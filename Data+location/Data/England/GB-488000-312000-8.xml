		<title>08Clay Pigeons at Cottesmore</title>
		<content> On Sunday 23rd June John Davis,       
 Mr.Hollis,Mr.Hodges,Mr.Joint,         
 Mr.Rimmer and some other farmers      
 and Andrew Hodges went Clay Pigeon    
 Shooting down at crash gate no:6,on   
 the airfield.Andrew and John were     
 originally coming down the road to    
 Glebe House but they saw that the     
 farmers were shooting towards them. So
 they went back to Cottesmore and then 
 to B-Hanger, and to crash gate no:6   
 and climbed over the fence. Mr.Hodges 
 and Mr.Hollis were shooting.Andrew's  
 score was 18/30,John's score was      
 17/30. A clay pigoen looks like a     
 round disc and is made out of carbon  
 dust. It has teeth on the outer       
 side,to keep it from slipping when    
 it's fired.When the shooting finished 
 John and Andrew looked for used clays,
 they found three and some spent       
 cartridges.                           </content>
