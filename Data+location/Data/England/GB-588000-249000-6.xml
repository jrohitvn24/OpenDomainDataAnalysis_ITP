		<content>Farming in this part of Suffolk is     
mainly arable,producing wheat,barley,  
oilseed rape and oats,with some peas,  
beans and potatoes.There are a few beef
cattle,pigs and poultry. Small farms   
have been absorbed into large holdings:
small fields have become larger by     
removal of boundary hedges,to give     
easier access for today's huge         
machinery.Conservationists are pressing
farmers to reintroduce hedges and      
woods;the natural habitat of many plant
and animal species at present in       
decline.Concern is also being expressed
about methods used to increase yields, 
particularly the use of chemicals and  
the consequent increase of nitrates in 
the soil and ultimately in the water   
supply.Farming is no longer labour-    
intensive,few local people rely on it  
as a source of income,though all       
benefit from increased food production.</content>
