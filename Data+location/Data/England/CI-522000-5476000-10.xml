		<title>10       OLD AIRPORT</title>
		<content> At L'Eree there is a large field where
 there was an{airport}before World War 
 2.There was no tarmac, only grass.    
 There were no runway lights and they  
 just landed on the grass. Double      
 winged planes called{Rapides}used the 
 airport. They could either go to      
 England or Alderney. If they wanted to
 go anywhere else they would have to   
 take a{flying boat}.                  
 Mr.Best,the owner, asked the Island   
 Development Committee if he could have
 some shelter for his sheep but the    
 I.D.C. said no because they thought it
 would look untidy.So there is no      
 shelter for his sheep. The sheep are  
 in the large field with wire around   
 it. Mr Best holds Showjumping events  
 in the field in the summer. In the    
 winter the field gets flooded. {
