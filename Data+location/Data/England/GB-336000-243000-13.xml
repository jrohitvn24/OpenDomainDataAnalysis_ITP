		<content> MEDICAL PRACTICE STAUNTON ON WYE      
 The practice based on Staunton and    
 Weobly covers 200sq miles with 5000   
 patients. (all NHS) It is run by 4    
 doctors, with locum help. Each works a
 12 hour day with 1 1/2 free days a    
 week, and alternate w/e and night     
 duties. There are also weekly surg-   
 eries  at 5 other village centres.    
 Covering this area means a lot of     
 travelling, difficult and tiring in   
 winter but compensated by the country-
 side. The practice has no cottage     
 hospital beds so patients go to       
 Hereford or Cheltenham. Most births   
 and deaths are in hospital. Two       
 district nurses cover the area their  
 workload growing as patients leave    
 hospital earlier and geriatric        
 population increases due to the area's
 popularity for retirement.
