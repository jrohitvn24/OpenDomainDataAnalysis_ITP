 HATFIELD HOUSE                        
 Before Hatfield House there was       
 Hatfield Palace.  It was built on land
 which was at first called Bishop's    
 Hatfield because it was owned by the  
 Bishop of Ely.  Later it housed Henry 
 VIII's children.  Elizabeth was here  
 when she heard she was to be Queen.   
 After Elizabeth I's death her first   
 minister, Robert Cecil, the First Earl
 of Salisbury, began the present       
 Hatfield House.  To provide building  
 material the old palace was           
 demolished, except for the Great Hall 
 with its impressive roof timbers.  The
 plan of the new house was in the shape
 of an E in honour of Elizabeth. It    
 stands in l300 acres with a Great Hall
 of panelling and tapestries.          </content>
