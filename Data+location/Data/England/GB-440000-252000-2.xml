 by the A 423 Trunk Road which comes   
 from Coventry in the North &amp; goes to  
 Banbury and Oxford in the South.The   
 village area lies at the junction of  
 two minor roads linking it to nearby  
 villages and to the A41 Trunk Road,   
 which lies to the South &amp; joins       
 Warwick and Oxford.Minor roads service
 most areas within the grid,&amp; footpaths
 link farms to the village area. The   
 Oxford Canal loops into the area,and  
 joins Fenny Compton by water to Oxford
 &amp; the Thames, to Nottingham and the   
 Trent,and via Coventry to Birmingham &amp;
 to Liverpool. There are no direct rail
 links - the nearest British Rail      
 Station is at Banbury. There are two  
 local buses daily, and schoolchildren 
 are transported daily from home to    
 school &amp; back where the distance is 3
