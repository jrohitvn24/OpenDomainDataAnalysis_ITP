		<content> In our interviewee's garden there is a
 little of everything. Single rows of a
 wide variety of vegetables, some to   
 use now,some to eat through the       
 winter. Some did well this year, some 
 not so well. The outdoor tomatoes were
 very late, but the greens and leeks   
 look good for the winter and there's  
 a nice crop of mangol (wurzles) for   
 the four tame sheep he always keeps.  
 He grew a couple of sunflowers again  
 for the chickens, but they aren't much
 good, which is a shame - the chickens 
 love them.                            
  He isn't exactly a "kept man" but    
 freely admits that his wife earns more
 than he does. She works for a big meat
 production company in Haverhill. The  
 suggestion of retirement next year is 
 quickly dismissed. He loves the garden
 which he is employed to maintain and  
 would miss his job dearly.            </content>
