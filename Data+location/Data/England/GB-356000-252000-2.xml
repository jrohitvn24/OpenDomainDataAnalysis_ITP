		<title>02Landscape around Pencombe</title>
		<content> Pencombe is situated in a basin       
 surrounded by high ridges to the north
 and west from which there are         
 panoramic views to all points of the  
 compass. Although most of the area is 
 high it is all cultivated with        
 valleys draining to the SW &amp; NE. The  
 majority of the fields are hedged with
 trees and are approximately ten to    
 twenty acres giving an impression of  
 rich farmland. The farmhouses are     
 varied, some black and white, others  
 stone or red brick.                   
 The view of the village from the road 
 between Hegdon and Gasbage gives an   
 impression of Pencombe nestling in a  
 fertile valley surrounded by fields   
 hedged with mature trees. The new red 
 brick dwellings contrast sharply with 
 the mellowed stone church and farm,   
 and whitewashed cottages.
