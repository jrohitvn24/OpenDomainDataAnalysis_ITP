		<content> IN OUR AREA WE HAVE A LOVELY COUNTRY  
 PARK CALLED 'CUERDEN VALLEY PARK'     
 WHICH WAS OPENED IN 1980 AS AN        
 AMENITY FOR THE AREA. COUNTRY PARKS   
 ARE LAND SPECIALLY SET ASIDE WHERE YOU
 CAN ENJOY THE COUNTRYSIDE. FARMERS    
 STILL OWN THE LAND AND YOU HAVE TO BE 
 CAREFUL TO REMEMBER THE COUNTRY CODE  
 AND NOT TO TRESPASS ON THE FARMER'S   
 FIELDS. YOU CAN ENJOY THE FARM        
 ANIMALS, WALK IN THE WOODS AND EVEN   
 FISH IN THE LAKE.  WE HAVE A WIDE     
 VARIETY OF SCENERY AND IT IS LOVELY TO
 TAKE AN EVENING WALK IN THE SUMMER. IN
 WINTER IT IS JUST AS BEAUTIFUL BUT IN 
 AN OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT WAY.  THE LOCAL
 CHILDREN LOVE TO TAKE THEIR SLEDGES TO
 THE SLOPES AND HILLS AND SLIDE DOWN IN
 THE SNOW VERY QUICKLY, USUALLY        
 SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER AS THEY FALL  
 INTO A PILE OF SNOW.
