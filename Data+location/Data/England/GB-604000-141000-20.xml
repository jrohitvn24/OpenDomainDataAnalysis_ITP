		<title>20A TEENAGE LOOK AT"THE STREET</title>
		<content>"The Street"Willesborough is like an   
English village.It has a variety of    
houses-Tudor,Georgian,cottages,modern  
bungalows,unique,and estate types.     
It is a good place to live because of  
its surroundings-the Harvey Hospital   
for emergencies for example!           
There is one snag about living here-   
the shops are 20minutes walk away.We   
have a bus every hour to Ashford and   
the coast.It is usually on time!       
There isn't alot to do here,but we can 
go to the play park or Broomfields.    
"The Street"is very picturesque and I  
prefer living here to any other village
or estate.My house is shown on Photo D.
