		<content> One day I went to the Gadds and       
 brushed John Boy down.   Dad told me  
 to put the saddle and bridle on. I    
 went off riding with Mrs. Gadd.   I   
 went up Mr. White's rides.   One goes 
 to Cannon's Green and the other goes  
 out to the road near Mr. White's      
 house.   Mr. White does not mind us   
 going along these.   We went round to 
 the river and after that we went down 
 to the little river which goes back to
 Birds Green.   This is where Daddy has
 his lunch when he is working on       
 thefarm.   We went home and at the    
 back of our house there is rape in the
 field.   John Boy, my pony, smells the
 rape.                                 
                                       
      Other recreations enjoyed by the 
 children in the school are fishing,   
 swimming, television, church choir,   
 Cubs, Brownies, Beavers, Guides.      </content>
