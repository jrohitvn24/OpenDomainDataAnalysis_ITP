		<content> Our second interview was with Mr.Cecil
 Frances.A Centenarian,he grew up in   
 Chatteris,Cambs.and won a scholarship 
 to Kirton Grammar School in 1898,at   
 the age of 13.He had to go for        
 lessons,on Saturdays,to a Pupil -     
 Teacher, Jessop-son of the local Baker
 (still Jessops,now!)After lessons,    
 their pocket money was spent on a     
 pennyworth of stale buns,to be eaten  
 later.Kirton,at that time,was'ever    
 such a little place',whose only claim 
 to fame was the Church of St.Peter and
 St.Paul,known as"the Cathedral of the 
 Fens".                                
 Leaving school,he worked for Francis  
 Kime,Ironmonger.When he was sacked    
 (for cycling to Sleaford on a         
 Saturday evening to visit a girl-     
 friend,instead of working!)he went    
 into farming in Frampton.He retired at
 74.                                   </content>
