		<title>16GAMES JULIA PLAYS AT SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> We decided to interview a pupil called
 Julia who lives in our D-block.We     
 chose her because she was very        
 interesting.She gets up about 8.30 or 
 8.35.She comes to school in a coach.  
 When she gets to school she plays with
 two of her friends and these are the  
 things she does at break;walks        
 around,plays catch,polo, and other    
 games.This is how you play Polo.It is 
 a game where one person is 'IT' she   
 calls somone up to her and gives them 
 a subject such as 'Trees'. so the girl
 goes back to the group of people and  
 tells them the subject.The girl shouts
 out all the things and the person     
 who's 'IT' shouts out one of the      
 trees.The first person back is 'IT'.  
 Julia's favourite subjects are        
 spelling,poems,English.There is no-one
 to play when she first arrives.She    
 goes home in a taxi.                  </content>
