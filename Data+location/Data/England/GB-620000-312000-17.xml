		<title>17Shopping in Hellesdon</title>
		<content>Hellesdon has a wide variety of shops  
in fact there is no need for anyone to 
drive more than three miles from their 
home to get most of their family needs.
There's only one newsagent on the      
Reepham Rd but other shops deliver     
newspapers. There is a stationary      
shop, shoe shop, foodstore, post       
office and an electrical shop.         
{The Industrial Estate} Part of        
Norwich Airport has been turned into   
an industrial estate and well known    
local firms operate on it eg. Palgrave 
Brown, Anglian Windows, Hellesdon      
Leather co, Nurdin and Peacock,        
Willhire Truck Rentals and Acrow       
Fencing. Further on, on the other side 
of Fifers Lane there is Vulcan Road    
which has a few more nationally known  
firms eg.Queensway and Payless D.I.Y.  
It's a big estate with many big firms  
working on both sides of Fifers Lane.  </content>
