 A favourite playground game which,    
 like many others, involves running is 
 called "Chainy".  Somebody is "it" and
 they chase you.  If they manage to    
 "tig" you then you hold hands and     
 chase the others.  When you have four 
 in one chain you halve it and make two
 chains.  The game continues until     
 everybody has been "tigged".  A       
 current favourite is called Run V T   
 where someone gives the initials of a 
 Television programme.  The person that
 knows it has to run across the        
 playground and say the name of the    
 programme.  As well as these games    
 many other children are playing with  
 balls, footballs, skipping ropes, and 
 other toys brought from home.
