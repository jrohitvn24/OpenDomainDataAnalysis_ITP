		<title>17A RETIRED PERSON'S DAY</title>
		<content> The object of retirement, contrary to 
 popular belief, is not to do less     
 work. I do much more but, because it  
 is mainly done in my own time, I com- 
 plete less. My day starts leisurely:  
 over my tea in bed I plan what I hope 
 to achieve that day - I never get     
 through it all. Because I am retired, 
 I get involved in many jobs: for      
 example, the Church of which I am     
 Treasurer, and 2 years ago I had 20   
 Diocesan and Deanery meetings a year. 
 Once the jobs which must be done that 
 day are completed and I have cleared  
 the house chores, I am free to give   
 the rest of the day to the Atlas I am 
 compiling, unless interrupted by      
 visitors. The day ends with little, or
 much, television and I fall asleep    
 over the News.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
