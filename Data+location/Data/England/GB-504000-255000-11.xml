		<title>11Red Gate Farm</title>
		<content> Red Gate Farm is an arable farm.Winter
 wheat and oil seed rape are the main  
 crops grown.Winter wheat is grown     
 rather than Spring wheat because the  
 soil here is very heavy and in spring 
 it is too wet to sow the seed and     
 the roots cannot grow well.It is much 
 better to sow the fields in Autumn    
 after the ground has had a chance to  
 dry during the summer.Wheat sown in   
 the Autumn also helps to keep the soil
 dry by absorbing moisture as it grows.
 Only two men work on Red Gate Farm    
 although there are 510 acres.This is  
 because the farmer owns many machines 
 including a hedge cutter,combine      
 harvester,crop sprayer,grain drier,   
 plough and drill.The average size of  
 the fields is 30 acres.The farmer     
 likes to complete his work in each    
 field in one day.He can do this with  
 fields of about 30 acres.             </content>
