		<content>   The front half of the shop is not as
 old as the back half. There are four  
 bedrooms and three rooms downstairs   
 that are not used for the shop. The   
 front two rooms and one side room are 
 used for the shop and Post Office.    
   The main shop has a wooden counter  
 and three freezers, there is a special
 area with a little counter for the    
 Post Office section.                  
   The building is a listed building as
 the rear of the building is over      
 350years old. The newer part of the   
 building was added 150years ago. As a 
 result of this the door frames in the 
 old part of the building are much     
 lower, so if you see people walking   
 around Ingoldsby with bumps on their  
 heads they have probably been visiting
 the family in the shop.
