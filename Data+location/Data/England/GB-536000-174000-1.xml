      Between 4 and 7 miles SE of      
central London,the area includes the   
valleys of the Ravensbourne and the    
Quaggy,the grassy plateau of           
Blackheath in the NE, Hilly Fields in  
the W and Blythe Hill in the SW.It has 
always been an area through which      
people have passed to and from Kent    
and the Channel Ports. In the 19th     
century it became a dormitory area for 
the expanding metropolis.It is an area 
of social and ethnic contrast.         
   Deptford is a socially deprived     
area. Brockley has a large West Indian 
and Asian population, and Blackheath   
islargely middle-class.During the      
1960 Lewisham developed as the main    
shopping centre for the whole area.    
Consequently  many of the surrounding  
shopping centres have declined.
