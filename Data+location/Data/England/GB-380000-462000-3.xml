		<title>03SETTLE CHURCH</title>
		<content> Settle Church is 147 years old it was 
 started in 1886 and was finished 2    
 years later. The first people to get  
 married where Susannah Hardacre and   
 Joseph Hartley on the 12th December   
 1894. They have services most days of 
 the week. The youngest person to be   
 buried in the church is Matthew Bulks 
 aged 3 minutes old. The graveyard     
 is used by all the local churches     
 and is soon going to have to be       
 extended. The bells in the tower are  
 about 2-3 feet long but are no longer 
 rung. People visit Settle Church      
 because of the Welsh grave stone and  
 the plaque in the doorway. The Welsh  
 grave stone is there in memory of a   
 Welsh person died who building the    
{Settle to Carlise line}and the plaque 
 to remember the other people who died 
 on the making of the line.
