		<title>15Farms in our area</title>
		<content> Our area is mainly arable farmland. We
 visited 10 of the farms. These ranged 
 from a smaller farm of 10 acres to a  
 larger farm of 412 acres. The majority
 of the farms grow wheat as their main 
 crop, but they also grow barley, oil  
 seed rape and potatoes. Some farms    
 grow fruit and allow the public to    
 "Pick your own". The soil type is     
 chalky boulder clay, and the average  
 field size is 20 to 25 acres. Most of 
 the farms have full time and part time
 employees. A few of the farms have    
 livestock ie cattle, sheep and        
 poultry. The farms produce straw bales
 for their own use. Many of the fields 
 have names and are separated by       
 ditches and fences. Most of the farms 
 have ponds and a few have streams or a
 river flowing through their land. The 
 plant and wildlife is in abundance on 
 all the farms.                        </content>
