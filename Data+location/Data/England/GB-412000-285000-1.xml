The block is primarily residential, the
houses having been built in the last   
sixty years.However a large part       
lies within the old manor of Yardley,  
which includes Yardley Old Village.The 
area is not particularly socially      
deprived although the flats in the     
area show some signs of the problems   
of city life. A substantial part is    
given over to urban recreational open  
space. There is a fairly large         
industrial estate in the block which   
shows the diversity of British industry
and,untypically,seems to be thriving.
