 Seymour is a small village north-west 
 of Yatton.It is a marshland village,  
 very low-lying.It has been flooded    
 several times. The last time was in   
 December,1981. New ditches have been  
 dug to stop it happening again. The   
 houses in the village are a mixture of
 old and new. The old houses were      
 mostly farmhouses. There is only one  
 shop in Kingston which sells general  
 groceries. There isn't a pub but there
 is a village hall. The Old school has 
 been made into a place where people   
 can learn to spin and weave wool. It  
 is run by Mrs Kingcott,a farmer's wife
 .She also has some Jacobs sheep to    
 spin the fleece into wool. These sheep
 have patches of brown and white wool.
