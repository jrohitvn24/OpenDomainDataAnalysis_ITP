		<title>20SHOPPING SURVEY IN WHITTON</title>
		<content> At about 11.30 am on July 2nd 1985 we 
 visited a small parade of shops at the
 corner of Hospital Bridge Road and    
 Staines Road: a tobacconist/grocer, a 
 grocer, a butcher, an off licence/post
 office/video shop and a newsagent.    
 They are 'everyday' shops with regular
 and local customers. At the butchers  
 the elder of the two men behind the   
 counter told us that the busiest day  
 is Friday. He said he loved his job.  
 For the third year running he has     
 become a champion sausage-maker. He   
 had to go to Yorkshire to have his    
 sausages judged. We heard that        
 what actually went into his sausages  
 was a secret. The two Asian women at  
 the counter in the grocers said their 
 busiest day was a Saturday. Pension   
 day was very busy at the newsagents we
 were told.
