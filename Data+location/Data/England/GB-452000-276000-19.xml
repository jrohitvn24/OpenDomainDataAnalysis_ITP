		<content>   Lanes around Catthorpe were widened 
 to take construction traffic,while the
 M1 was being built.With the loss of   
 trees and hedges (many dating back to 
 the enclosure of 1655/6) such animals 
 as weasles, stouts,yellow hammers,and 
 plants as violets and blackberries are
 no longer a common sight.             
   Farmers in the area have a "love" of
 the land and try to replace any hedge 
 or tree they need to fell.Although    
 they burn their stubble,they are very 
 careful not to create a nuisance,     
 because of the M1.                    
   The River Avon is tested regularly  
 by the Severn Trent Water Authority   
 for any pollution,caused mainly by    
 diesel and rubber  being washed off   
 the motorway by rain.                 
   Presently it is clean and full of   
 fish.
