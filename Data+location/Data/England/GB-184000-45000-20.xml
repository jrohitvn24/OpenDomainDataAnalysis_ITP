		<content> The people of the area could not have 
 been more helpful to us. They are     
 friendly and co-operative. It is not  
 typical perhaps of a normal Cornish   
 village and surrounding country area  
 as most of the people travel to the   
 larger towns to work. Also, the farms 
 are mostly managed for people or      
 groups based outside the area.        
 However, the people still have that   
 local attitude to life that makes them
 fairly content and happy without the  
 stresses of city life.                
      Hopefully, the area will not slip
 back too far as shop closures threaten
 and the fate of it's river (commercial
 shipping used to come right up but now
 it is silted right over) not a        
 foretaste of it's future.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
