		<content>   "On a Tuesday I get up at about 8 O'
clock.I go downstairs and join all my  
family for breakfast.We normally have  
cereal,toast and orange juice.After    
breakfast we get ready for school.My   
father and brother leave at 8:30,I     
leave at 8:45.At school I join my      
friends in the playground and we       
usually talk until 8:55,when the       
whistle goes.We go into school and     
lessons begin.We have lessons like     
Maths,Geography,History,English,P.E. or
Swimming.Morning school ends at 12:15  
when we have lunch.Some children have a
school dinner,some stay at school but  
eat their own sandwiches,some go home  
for lunch.Afternoon school begins at   
13:25 and ends at 15:45.When I get home
I have a drink and watch T.V. then we  
have tea.After tea on Tuesday I get    
ready for Guides,where we work for     
badges.When I get home I go to bed."   </content>
