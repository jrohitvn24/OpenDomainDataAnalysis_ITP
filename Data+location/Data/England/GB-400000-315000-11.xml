  Lots of people use{Cannock Chase}    
for walks and picnics. You may see     
{deer} and other wildlife there.       
  A very interesting and beautiful     
walk takes you through coniferous      
woodlands down {Fairoak Valley.}       
The track goes near to an old{disused  
mine} all overgrown with trees.        
  In the valley are two pools called   
{Fairoak pools.}They are used for      
private trout fishing. The firemen also
use them for water if there is a       
forest fire. Several waterbirds can be 
seen there.                            
  Lower down the valley are two other  
pools called{Stonybrook pools.}They    
were used by the old Fairoak Colliery  
about 100 years ago. A few remains of  
the colliery can be seen amongst the   
trees.                                 
                                       </content>
