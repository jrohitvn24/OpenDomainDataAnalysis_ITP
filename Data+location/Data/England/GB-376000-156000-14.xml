		<title>14CHURCH: FARLEIGH HUNGERFORD</title>
		<content>  THE CHURCH IN FARLEIGH HUNGERFORD IS 
 NAMED AFTER{ST. LEONARD,}THE PATRON   
 SAINT OF PRISONERS. IT BELONGS TO THE 
 CHURCH OF ENGLAND. IT IS SHAPED LIKE A
 CROSS, AND WAS BUILT BY THE HUNGERFORD
 FAMILY IN THE 14th-15th CENTURY. A    
 NEW CHIMNEY HAS BEEN ADDED, AS THE    
 CHURCH NOW HAS OIL HEATING.           
  INSIDE THE CHURCH, AT THE BACK, THERE
 ARE TWO STAINED GLASS WINDOWS, NEAR   
 WHICH STAND A PIPE ORGAN AND A FONT.  
 BEHIND THE FONT ARE BELL ROPES TO THE 
 THREE BELLS. THERE ARE 23 PEWS.       
  OUTSIDE, BY THE DOOR, IS AN OLD SHOE 
 SCRAPER, AND ON TOP OF THE CHURCH IS A
 WEATHER COCK. AN APPEAL HAS BEEN      
 LAUNCHED FOR REPAIRS TO THE ROOF.     
 THERE ARE 57 GRAVES, WHICH DATE BACK  
 TO BEFORE THE CHURCH WAS BUILT. THE   
 LARGE HOUSE NEXT TO THE CHURCH USED TO
 BE THE VICARAGE.
