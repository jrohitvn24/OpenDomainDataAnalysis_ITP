		<content>I bring a packed lunch to eat as my mum
has 3 children and she can't afford a  
school dinner for us all. A dinner     
cooked in school costs 66p. 2 children 
in my class have school dinners and 2  
go home. Children who eat in school can
have a bottle of milk. We enjoy        
alternate Thursday afternoons because  
we travel by coach to a local sports   
field for games as we have no grass on 
our premises. Our school was built in  
1907 and is now being refurbished. We  
have builders in and eventually our    
school will look more attractive. We   
leave school at 3.30pm. Many children  
go to Cubs or Brownies after tea. Every
Thursday I receive pocket money when   
Dad returns from work. Luckily he has a
job again. A few months ago he was made
redundant. This has happened to 8      
parents in my class. I get 50p and buy 
sweets, a magazine and save 10p.       </content>
