		<title>12ANSTEY SWIFTS FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content> In Anstey alot of people like fooball.
 We have a local junior football team  
 called the Anstey Swifts. It has been 
 going for five and a half years. The  
 pitch is behind the Martin High       
 School. There are 6 different teams.  
 The under 10 to the under 16's. The   
 under tens are not doing very we;l    
 this year.                            
 The Swifts play 24 games a year all on
 Sunday mornings.                      
 They play in black and white tops with
 black socks and shorts.               
 At the end of each season there is a  
 presentation when each player is given
 a plaque to comemorate the season they
 have just played.
