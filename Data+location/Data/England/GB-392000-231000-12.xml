		<title>12Games We Play at School</title>
		<content> The most popular games are played in  
 the summer.Elastics is a game played  
 with elastic and three people.Two     
 people stand in a ring of elastic,    
 while the other one jumps in and out  
 of the elastic.This used to be        
 called French Skipping.We also play a 
 game called British Bulldog at the    
 bottom of the field. Two people are   
 on; they pick a person to run across. 
 The person has to get across without  
 being pushed down. If he makes it all 
 the other people can run across.We    
 also play playground tag. Two people  
 are 'on' and the rest have to try to  
 get to the bench but the two that are 
 'on' guard the bench. We also play    
 rounders, cricket and sometimes tennis
 too.In the winter we slide along the  
 flat snow,but there aren't so many    
 popular winter games. We often just   
 stand around talking.                 </content>
