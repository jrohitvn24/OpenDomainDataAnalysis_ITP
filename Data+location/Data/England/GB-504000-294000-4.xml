		<title>04NASSINGTON STABLES.</title>
		<content>The stables were started in April 1983 
because the owner wanted to work for   
herself,with horses,and didn't want to 
be unemployed. The site covers two     
acres and she has twelve horses and    
ponies.There are 12 stables with one   
large and one small teaching area.     
There are one hour and half hour       
lessons in basic dressage and jumping  
costing five pounds and three pounds.A 
ride out for one hour is four pounds   
and fifty pence and escorted rides     
cost five pounds fifty.There is one    
full time helper and four part time    
helpers who come from nearby towns and 
villages.The people who come to ride   
are between the ages of five and fifty 
and are mostly from London,Peterborough
Yarwell Mill and all the villages      
around Nassington.Recently new stables 
have been built and grazing land       
acquired in neighbouring villages.     </content>
