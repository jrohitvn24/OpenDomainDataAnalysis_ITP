		<content> The Amey Roadstone Company, known as  
 ARC, quarries materials from the rough
 heathland along Puddletown Road.      
 Various grades of sand and gravel are 
 extracted to be used in road building,
 and some is made into blocks for      
 general building purposes. Spent      
 quarries are restored to agriculture  
 where possible, or to forestry use,   
 while poorer land is returned to      
 heathland by planting with the top    
 layer removed when making a new       
 quarry. ll0 acres of land which will  
 not yield any useful materials have   
 been leased to the Dorset Naturalists'
 Trust for conservation purposes. ARC  
 employs something under 50 men at the 
 Gallows Hill operation and is an      
 important factor in the local economy.
