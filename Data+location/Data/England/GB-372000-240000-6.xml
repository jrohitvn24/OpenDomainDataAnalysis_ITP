		<title>06Colwall Race Course</title>
		<content>  Before the second World War there    
 were many more race-courses in Britain
 than there are today, and one of them 
 was in Colwall. Racegoers used to     
 arrive in the village by train before 
 the advent of the motor car, and      
 special trains were laid on to bring  
 them. The name of the public house    
 called The Horse and Jockey is one of 
 the few remaining reminders of the old
 race-course, because after the war,   
 racing in Colwall, as in many other   
 places, was never resumed. For many   
 years the course was overgrown with   
 brambles, but with rising prices for  
 farm products it was recently cleared,
 ploughed, and returned to farmland.   
 Old photographs of Colwall race days  
 are still to be seen in The Park      
 Hotel, in the heart of the village.   
 The nearest racecourse now is at      
 Worcester.                            </content>
