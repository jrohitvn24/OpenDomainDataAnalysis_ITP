 area of Lady Lane is that the 'Lady'  
 is in fact Anne Boleyn, 2nd wife of   
 Henry VIII, who was in fact beheded.  
 (The story of the beheading and its   
 reasons could have become distorted by
 time). It is believed that at one time
 Anne lived to the North East of our   
 square near Thorns Green and could    
 have used the lane to visit houses in 
 the area e.g. Bollin House. It is     
 interesting that on early maps the    
 area to the east of Mobberley was     
 known as 'Le Bolyn'. Thus giving some 
 credance to the family name of Boleyn 
 despite the spelling difference.      
 The fact that a 'Lady' appears so     
 often in varying stories and there is 
 a Lady Lane suggests the sightings    
 have been numerous and have been      
 taking place over a long period of    
 time.                                 </content>
