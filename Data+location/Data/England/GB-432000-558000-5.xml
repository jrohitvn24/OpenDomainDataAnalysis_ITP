 The church in Castletown called, St.  
 Margaret's, was built by a Colonel    
 Briggs.  His son in law Gee, was the  
 first minister whose eldest son was   
 killed in the first world war.  There 
 was a plaque in the church as a       
 memorial to the son. At present there 
 is no full-time minister. In Town End 
 Farm there are two religious          
 communities, one is the Anglican St.  
 Bede's and the other is the Roman     
 Catholic St. John Bosco.  Both        
 churches offer a wide variety of clubs
 and societies for people and children 
 in the area.
