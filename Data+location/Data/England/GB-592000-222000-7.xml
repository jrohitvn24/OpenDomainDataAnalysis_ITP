		<title>07STANWAY SAND &amp; GRAVEL PITS</title>
		<content>  There are many{sand and gravel pits  
 in our area.Two boys visited a local  
 pit which has been worked for 58      
 years.90 acres have been dug.The      
 material is dug out by{excavator      
 operated by one man.8 other men are   
 employed.The machinery is mainly      
{electrically operated.}Two thousand   
 tons of sand and gravel are produced  
 each week much of which is taken from 
 the site by teams of lorries.         
  Because this area is expanding much  
 sand and gravel is needed for{building
 new housing estates and roads.        
  When the quarry is exhausted the     
 company hopes to fill it in and make  
 it into a{leisure park,golf course and
{boating lake.
