		<content> Running from Anglezarke Moor in the   
 west to Darwen and Turton Moors in the
 east, the height varies from 267      
 metres at the Belmont Reservoir's edge
 to 396 metres at Cartridge Hill, with 
 Great Hill and Old Adam's Hill being  
 also easily distinguishable.  There is
 a cairn on Old Adam's Hill, and       
 Hanging Stones on Turton Moor are     
 reputed to have been used to execute  
 sheep stealers in years gone by.      
 Spitler's Edge is a well-used walk way
 and is the ancient boundary between   
 Sharples and Anglezarke townships.    
 The A675, which bisects the block     
 north to south, follows the line of   
 the Bolton to Nightingales Turnpike   
 (except where it has been diverted    
 around the reservoir).  A toll house, 
 Longworth Bar, once stood in the layby
 in Block 7.
