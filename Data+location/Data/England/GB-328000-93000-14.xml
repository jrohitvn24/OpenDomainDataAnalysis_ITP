  At the Trout Farm we stopped at a    
 house.                                
   There was nobody there so we got out
 of the car and looked around.         
   We saw three calves four peacocks   
 some ducks and two puppies.Then we saw
 someone who told us to come through.  
   He said when the trout are ready to 
 lay eggs the people at the farm have  
 to squeeze the eggs out of the        
 trout.                                
   The eggs have to be put in cold     
 water. When the eggs hatch the there  
 colour is plain grey then in about 2  
 years they turn spotted.              
   When they are fully grown they      
 rainbow coloured.                     
   The trout lay about 10,000 eggs     
 a year.                               </content>
