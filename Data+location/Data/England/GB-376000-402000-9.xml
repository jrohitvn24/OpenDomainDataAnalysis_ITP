		<title>09Croal-Irwell Valley</title>
		<content>     On Friday 14th June the{warden    
 of the{Croal-Irwell valley,}Mr.       
 Wolstencroft, came to school to show  
 us some slides.The slides were about  
 the work that has been done to change 
 this industrial valley into an area   
 where{wildlife}is{encouraged}and      
 protected.                            
     The{river}has been{cleaned, paths 
 have been{built}and a{lake}which was  
 formed by the removal of gravel, has  
 been{landscaped.                      
     He showed us a couple of slides of
{animals}that had been deliberately    
{killed}and on a few slides there were 
 signs of{chemical waste.}One slide    
 showed the river with frothy pink dye 
 from a factory making toilet rolls.   
     At the end he showed us some funny
 slides with some of his workmates     
 stuck in funny situations.
