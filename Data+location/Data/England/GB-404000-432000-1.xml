		<title>01ROUND AND ABOUT DENHOLME</title>
		<content> A general view reveals 4 reservoirs,  
 open moorland, rough grazing and      
 several farms.                        
                                       
 The village of{Denholme}(population : 
 approx.3,000) is the main centre of   
 habitation.{Denholme Clough}was an    
 equally well established community    
 until the woollen industry came to    
 Denholme in l830. The village then    
 grew rapidly but changed little until 
 the l930 when a new wave of building, 
 both corporation and private, began,  
 mainly for commuters to Bradford and  
 Keighley, and is gradually continuing.
 There is a small shopping area and    
 some industry.                        
                                       
{Keelham,}a hamlet at a cross roads and
{Leeming}, on the outskirts of Oxenhope
 (0335) have changed little in the last
 150 years.                            </content>
