    On Lincoln Road, by the allotments,
 a gravel-pit was located, close by is 
 the site of an Anglo-Saxon burial     
 ground (see text page 5). From this   
 point one used to be able to walk     
 through open fields to the junction of
 Millview Road and Westgate using      
 stepping stones to climb over fences. 
 Post-war prefabricated buildings were 
 the first structures to appear on this
 site in 1950, since then it has grown 
 into a large council estate.          
    In 1960, 14, Westgate was trans-   
 formed into a ladies hairdressing     
 salon called "Daphne's". Daphne later 
 extended into 16, Westgate, a four    
 hundred year old timber framed        
 building constructed of lathe and     
 plaster, mud and stud. Sadly, this
