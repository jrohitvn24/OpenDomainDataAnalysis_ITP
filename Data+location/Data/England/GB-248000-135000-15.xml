		<content>{The Beacon}is so named because it was 
 here that a fire was lit to convey the
 alarm when{the Spaniards}attempted    
 invasion in{1588.}From the top there  
 is a magnificent view of the          
 surrounding scenery.To the{east}      
{Barnstaple}, on the nearside{Heanton} 
{hill.}Due south is the confluence of  
{the Taw and the Torridge}forming the  
 estuary which leads out to{the Bar.   
{Appledore}is visible across the       
 estuary,and on it's near bank{Braunton
{Pill}reaches into{Velator.}Away to the
 west is{Saunton}with it's sandhills,to
 the south{Hartland Point and the      
{island of Lundy}a dozen miles out into
 the{Bristol Channel.}This is the spot 
 to also see the vast pattern of the   
 Great field and to see how large the  
 environs of Braunton have now become.
