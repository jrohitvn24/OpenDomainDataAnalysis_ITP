		<content>   The oldest building is Morland      
 Church tower which is the only SAXON  
 tower in Cumbria.It's immense         
 walls and rounded arches date it.It is
 thought to be a tower marking the     
 influence of a Saxon noble and to it  
 was added a Norman nave in the C12.The
 first priest,Adam' signed a document  
 in 1179.                              
    About 100 years later the first    
 rebuilding took place which resulted  
 in the present nave and transepts.    
 Further changes took place after the  
 Reformation in the C15 and C16 when   
 the chancel was built and the tower   
 height raised so that bells could be  
 put in.                               
    During the C19 the church fell into
 decay and at the end of that century  
 the last great restoration took place 
 when the present day church emerged.
