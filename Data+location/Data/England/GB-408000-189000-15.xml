		<content>{Herb pillows}are becoming tremendously
 popular.They are quite easy to make   
 as long as you have a good supply of  
 dried herbs.If you dont grow your own 
 herbs you can buy from herb growers.  
                                       
 Making your own{cosmetics}is simple.  
 Cleansing creams,bath oils and        
 nourishing creams can be made to suit 
 your own requirements.                
                                       
 To make{bath bags}you need small      
 porous bags of soft cotton material.  
 Put some tape to hang from the tap    
 and fill with a mixture of herbs.     
                                       
 For{rinsing dark hair}take a handful  
 of fresh rosemary leaves or one       
 tablespoon of dried leaves and place  
 them in a jug.After you have done that
 add 1 litre of boiling water and steep
 for about 30 minutes.                 </content>
