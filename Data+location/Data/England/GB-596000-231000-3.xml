		<content> Christian worship has been practised  
 on or near this site since the time of
 the Normans.The original Parish Church
 of St.Peter and St.Paul was destroyed 
 completely by a German bomb in        
 September 1940.It was rebuilt,not with
 the original stones,but brick and     
 rendered plaster,during 1957 at a cost
 of just under Â£25,000.It was          
 reconsecrated in 1958.The five bells  
 in the tower came from All Saints     
 Church in Colchester when it was      
 closed down.It is the only Church in  
 the country to contain three solid oak
 effigies.These represent the De       
 Horkesley family.The brasses showing  
 the two Swynbourne Knights were badly 
 damaged during the bombing,but still  
 remain in the Church.
