{ }Cricket is played next to the Dam   
 Close (see Local History pages).In the
 team are 11 players from Willoughby   
 and the surrounding areas.The team is 
 not very successful because they have 
 not won many leagues or cups but they 
 enjoy themselves.Mr.G.Bristow is the  
 captain this season.                  
             {Tennis                   
{ }The tennis courts are at Weston's   
 farm and Mrs.O.Weston runs them.The   
 courts are hard-surface and enclosed  
 by wire netting.The facility is pro-  
 vided free of charge and it is also   
 possible to borrow equipment.
