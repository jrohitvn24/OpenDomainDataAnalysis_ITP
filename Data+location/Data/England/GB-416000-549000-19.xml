 Two groups of children looked at the {
{flowers and trees}in different        
 habitats and identified them.One      
 interesting area was once the spoil   
 heap and site of the Charlie Pit and  
 Brickworks.{Reclaimed}about 8 years   
 ago, lots of wild flowers grow there  
 now and trees have been planted       
 One group looked at{pollution.}We have
 54 waste bins around our school but we
 were shocked at the amount of litter  
 we found.Our cleaners must have a hard
 time cleaning up after us             </content>
