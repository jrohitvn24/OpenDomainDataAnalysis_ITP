 After lunch I usually go into         
 Dartford with my Mum and Dad          
 or with my friend.  If I go           
 with Mum and Dad we go in the         
 car, and I leave them in Dartford     
 and meet up later;  if I go with      
 my friend we go on the bus.  I        
 look around the shops and I might     
 spend my pocket money, which is       
 Â£l.5O per week.  I usually go         
 into a cafe for a drink and play      
 on the machines.  If I am meeting     
 my Mum and Dad we meet up at about    
 four thirty outside MacDonald's       
 and we go in for our tea.  I have     
 a big Mac and chips and a big  Coke.  
 Sometimes you get a toy car which     
 Mac Donald's are giving away free.    
 We get home for about six o'clock     
 and I watch television until bedtime. 
 Not very interesting, is it?          </content>
