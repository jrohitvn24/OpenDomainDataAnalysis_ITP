		<title>04THE SOUTH DOWNS WAY</title>
		<content> This is a long-distance footpath of 80
 miles established in 1972 by the      
 Countryside Commission and goes from  
 Beachy Head to Buriton in Hampshire.  
 This was the main route across Sussex 
 in prehistoric times and it is a well 
 used bridle path with 360 degree      
 views.  The remains of a Bronze Age   
 trackway, a cross dyke, goes south to 
 Seaford and a small section is still  
 visible near Hobbs Hawth and forms    
 part of the existing footpath.  It was
 embanked to prevent cattle straying,  
 and in the existing boundary hedge are
 several granite posts about 2ft. high 
 with the letter 'P' incised.  These   
 were boundary stones to mark Pinchem  
 Farm, which is on the first Ordnance  
 Survey Map of 1873.  This farm is now 
 called Rathfinny.  Hang-gliders use   
 the South Downs Way as a suitable     
 place to practise their sport.        </content>
