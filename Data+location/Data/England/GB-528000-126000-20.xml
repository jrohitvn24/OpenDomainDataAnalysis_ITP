		<title>20TRANSPORT CUCKFIELD RURAL</title>
		<content> In this truly rural district a car is 
 a necessity not a luxury. Public      
 transport is very infrequent,one bus  
 every two hours to Crawley and Hay-   
 wards Heath,the two nearest towns, and
 none at all after 6.0 p.m. or on Sun- 
 days.Older children travel on coaches 
 to Warden Park school at Cuckfield,but
 younger children are usually taken to 
 school by car,especially if they live 
 on an isolated farm.Many women drive, 
 and a car is essentialto visit shops ,
 the Doctor,dentist,banks or post      
 office. Pensioners may purchase a card
 to allow half fare travel on buses,   
 which is helpful if they live near the
 bus route. The railway from London to 
 Brighton has stations near this area  
 and is a quick and efficient way to   
 travel.
