		<title>15THE RAILWAY IN GOXHILL.</title>
		<content> The Cleethorpes, Grimsby, Barton on   
 Humber railway line passes through the
 village. Except for a signalman the   
 station is unmanned. On weekdays there
 are 14 passenger trains a day in each 
 direction. There are plans to shut the
 line on Sundays in the winter as so   
 few people use it. The line has       
 declined with the closure of the ferry
 at New Holland. A few goods trains    
 going to and from the Brit Ag         
 fertilizer factory at Barton use the  
 line and it is perhaps this traffic   
 that prevents the line coming under   
 more serious threat of closure. The   
 line is supported by the County       
 Council as part of the Humberlink     
 service using bus and rail to link    
 Hull and Grimsby. Goxhill station is a
 scene of derilection although the     
 station house is now a privately owned
 museum of railway memorabilia.        </content>
