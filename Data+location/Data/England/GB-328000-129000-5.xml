		<content>{Bread and cake making.                
 Lots of childrens' Mums at school make
 their own bread and cakes.My Mum      
 is capable of making both these       
 things,but she usually makes only     
 brown bread.There are lots of         
 different ways of making cakes and    
 lots of different ingredients.You can 
 get two lots of different shaped tins 
 to put them in. Almost all the people 
 in my class have home made bread.There
 are 18 families in our class who make 
 their own bread.
