		<content>  The largest village in the area is   
{Ailsworth}which is situated along the 
 busy A47 road.  It is joined to its   
 neighbouring village, Castor.  The    
 number of dwellings in Ailsworth is   
 well over one hundred and includes    
 many styles and sizes of buildings.   
 Some houses are owned by the local    
 authority, but much of it is privately
 owned and quite expensive.  In recent 
 years the village has expanded with   
 the growth of nearby Peterborough.    
  As its name suggests{Waternewton}is  
 located close to water, on the banks  
 of the River Nene.  The village itself
 is very small, with few facilities,   
 the total number of dwellings being   
 less than thirty.  A focal point of   
 the village is the old watermill,     
 presently being restored.  Beside the 
 village is a lock on the River Nene   
 which is well used by river traffic.  </content>
