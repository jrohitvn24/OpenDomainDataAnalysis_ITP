		<title>20Rode Tropical Bird Gardens.</title>
		<content> Rode lies between two main roads, the 
 A361 and the A36, and is not the      
 traditional picture postcard village  
 it would not normally be visited by   
 tourists. However many thousands of   
 people come every year to the Tropical
 Bird Gardens. These lie just outside  
 the village on the road to Bath. They 
 are famous throughout Britain,        
 particularly for a cockatoo which     
 starred for many years on a children's
 television animal programme. Many of  
 the birds fly freely in the gardens   
 and the brightly coloured macaws can  
 often be seen flying over the village,
 a spectacular sight.                  
                                       
 This report has been prepared by 10   
 members of Rode Womens Institute as   
 part of the commemoration of our 65th 
 anniversary. We have learned much     
 about our area as a result.           </content>
