		<content> A large majority of people in the     
 D_block enjoy sport eg.               
 football,tennis,cricket.Nature        
 associations and clubs are also very  
 popular,perhaps because of the people 
 living in the country_side.Interst    
 in art and music is only slight,only  
 five people mentioning it on the      
 questionaire returns.                 
 Leisure activities appear very        
 popular,for example Womens            
 Institute and camping.Perhaps being   
 in the South West means it being      
 lovely and sunny and able to do most  
 outdoor activities.Only nine were     
 involved in charities like Save the   
 Children and Oxfam.                   
 Quite a few people are associated     
 with the services,like the Marines    
 and the Navy.
