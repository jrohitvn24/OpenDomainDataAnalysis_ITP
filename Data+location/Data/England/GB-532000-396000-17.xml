		<content>  The recently completed Fulstow       
 village hall was probably the most    
 well used and important amenity in the
 area. Over 50% of the population who  
 were interviewed went there weekly or 
 even more frequently.It was mentioned 
 by many people as being one of the    
 reasons that they enjoyed living here.
  Our mobile library and fish and chip 
 vans were also very popular,but many  
 were disappointed that the post office
 was the only shop in the area. Most   
 people preferred to do their shopping 
 weekly, or even monthly,at the super  
 markets in town. Everyone thought that
 the prices were expensive at the local
 shop.                                 
   Finally, 90% of people who answered 
 our questionnaire thought that the    
 Domesday project was worthwhile ,     
 though some had never heard of it !
