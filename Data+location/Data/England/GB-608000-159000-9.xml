		<content> This rural area, mainly covered by    
 woodland is rich in bird life.        
 One area, Church Wood, constitutes a  
 National Nature Reserve started in    
 l952.  Other interested bodies        
 involved include the Nature           
 Conservancy Council and the R.S.P.B.  
 Some of the land is privately owned.  
 The usual woodland birds can be       
 sighted in the area as well as greater
 and lesser woodpeckers which inhabit  
 the high canopy areas and the spotted 
 flycatcher which is seen along the    
 open rides.                           
 The coppiced areas being rich in      
 insect life are populated by the      
 nightingale, blackcap,garden          
 warbler,whitethroat,chiffchaff and    
 willow warbler.                       
 The nightingale's song is often heard 
 as well as the raucous call of the    
 jay.                                  </content>
