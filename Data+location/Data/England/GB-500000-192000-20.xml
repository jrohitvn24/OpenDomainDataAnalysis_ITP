		<title>20Road safety near our school</title>
		<content>  Now that the{M25}has been opened the 
 main road along the front of the      
 school has become dangerous.It's      
 become dangerous because before the   
 motorway was opened there was heavy   
 traffic,now traffic just zooms along  
 breaking the speed limit.There is a   
 bridge and a set of traffic lights but
 people just run across the road.The   
 Council might be planning to pull the 
 bridge down and that means children   
 who have to cross on the bridge wont  
 use the traffic lights and just run   
 across the road.The speed the cars    
 travel at a child could be killed     
 instantly.I think the motorway is a   
 good idea but they{could}make the     
 roads a bit safer.
