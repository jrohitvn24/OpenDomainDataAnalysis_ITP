		<title>05St. Mary's Church, Shapwick</title>
		<content>   No firm date can be given to when   
 the first church in Shapwick was      
 built.There have been a church in     
 Shapwick in the early{8th century.}It 
 is by{Beerway Farm}about half a mile  
 East of the present Church.Electric   
 lights were installed in 1936 and the 
 paraffin lamps removed.The oil lamps  
 are used once a year at the candle and
 lamp service.From 1345 to 1353 no less
 than six vicars were appointed.This   
 was probably because the{Black Death  
 broke out in Somerset in 1349.The     
 vicarage was built in 1926,the        
 original was{burnt down}in 1920 in the
 early morning of Dec.15th.The flames  
 spread quickly and the fire brigade of
 Glastonbury arrived too late because  
 the horses slipped on the icy roads.  
 The vicar's valuable library and most 
 of the downstairs furniture were saved
 by the villagers.                     </content>
