		<content>     {Miss Dorothy Johnson}has lived   
 in{Bocking}all her life. When  she    
 was 3 or 4 she went to Sunday School, 
 which was held at the village primary 
 school.{Miss Johnson}went to{Bocking  
{Church School}and she learnt maths,   
 geography, English and history. The   
 boys did gardening and the girls did  
 knitting. When she was twelve she went
 to a{Braintree}school which opened in 
 the 1920's and closed about 15 years  
 later. Most children walked or cycled 
 to school because there were no buses.
      Most of the shopping was done in 
{Bocking,}where there was a variety of 
 shops. Occasional journeys were made  
 to{Colchester}for special items.      
 Clothes were often made at home or by 
 a local dressmaker.                   
      Visits to her Grandad, meant     
 walking to{Halstead}and then a further
 6 six miles on.                       </content>
