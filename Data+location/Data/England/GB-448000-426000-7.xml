   We went around the area looking for 
 signs and roads. We found 19 different
 kinds of signs. The oldest one was the
 mile stone which had the distances to 
 Doncaster, Pontefract, York, and      
 Tadcaster.                            
        The three most important roads 
 running through our area are the A1   
 dual carriageway, which goes from     
 London to Edinborough, the A162 Trunk 
 Road and the lanes leading to Hillam  
 and Burton Salmon.                    
        The A1 dual carriageway has, on
 average, 7,000 cars an hour. The A162 
 has about 300 cars an hour and the    
 Hillam Road has only 50 cars an hour.
