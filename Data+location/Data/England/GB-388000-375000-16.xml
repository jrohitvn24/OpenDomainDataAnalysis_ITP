		<title>16Tytherington-New Housing.</title>
		<content>   A large programme of house building 
 is taking place between Manchester and
 the Bollin Valley in Tytherington.    
   The buildings include bungalows,    
 semi-detached houses and detached     
 houses,with varying numbers of        
 bedrooms.                             
   Nearby,a golf course is being       
 constructed close to the site of      
 Tytherington Old Hall.                
   The Hall was threatened by          
 demolition,but it has been preserved  
 for the present.                      
   The golf course will be the first   
 18-hole course in Macclesfield(there  
 is already a 9-hole course).It will   
 have to compete with Prestbury's      
 famous 18-hole course.                
   Tytherington,it seems,will become an
 even larger residential area and      
 include more recreational facilities  
 which,at present,are rather limited.  </content>
