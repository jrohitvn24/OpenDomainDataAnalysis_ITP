		<title>08Mining - Acklington Opencast</title>
		<content> An N.C.B. opencast mine, named the    
{"Acklington Extension",}lies to the   
 south of the village. The site has    
 been worked for the last 10 years and 
 the land is now being restored. When  
 the mine was in full production there 
 were 120 workers and the coal was     
 taken to the screening plant at       
 Widdrington before being sent to power
 stations. Now the large dragline has  
 gone and only 80 men, using large     
 machines such as dumper trucks,       
 shovels, scrapers and water dowsers,  
 work up to 12 hours each day to       
 restore the land to what it once was. 
 Two workers were tragically killed on 
 the site a few years ago.             
 Not everyone has welcomed the mine.   
 It has meant an ugly scar on the      
 landscape for the last 10 years and   
 there have been problems with dust,   
 noise and vibrations from blasting.   </content>
