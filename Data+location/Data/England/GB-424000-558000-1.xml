		<content> Physically this 'D' block consists of 
 a ridge of Carboniferous Sandstone    
 rising to 152m(500') with lowland to  
 the East and West. The sandstone has  
 been quarried in the past although    
 most of the quarries are now disused. 
 In the West the ridge descends into a 
 wide flat floored valley at present   
 occupied by a small stream - the River
 TEAM - much of which flows in a       
 culvert. Coalmining attracted many    
 people to this area in the 19th       
 century, the mines have been exhausted
 and now little sign of their existance
 remains. The mining is now represented
 by the tracks of old railways, now    
 forming a system of footpaths, and an 
 area of urban open space on the graded
 flanks of spoil heaps now grass       
 covered.
