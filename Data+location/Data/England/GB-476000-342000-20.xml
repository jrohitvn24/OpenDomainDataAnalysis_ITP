		<title>20Home Life</title>
		<content> With the drudgery of life in poorly   
 equiped houses and the hardness of    
 seeking a living from the land without
 modern impliments now gone,home life  
 in a peaceful,pollution free          
 enviroment should be ideal.However the
 rural man now has more expense in     
 living and travelling in country areas
 which mean less time to spend in the  
 home.More wives work to help with the 
 upkeep of this life style therefore   
 she has less time to spend with her   
 children and to enjoy the pleasures of
 rural life.Many only have time to     
 observe nature through the t.v screens
 btu others have time to 'stand and    
 stare',a rare commodity!This survey   
 was carried out on behalf of          
 Kilvington &amp; District W.I. by Mrs     
 Carol Drury and computer operaters,{  
{ADAM DRURY}and{SIMON GASKELL}with some
 minor help from A.D.Allen.            </content>
