		<content>  One of the popular places in our     
area for visitors, is Hornsea Pottery. 
The site takes up about 42 acres and   
the whole complex employs about 200    
people, (less in the winter). The      
factory opened in 1974 although the    
company started in Hornsea in          
Yorkshire in 1949. In the factory      
they make table ware such as tea sets, 
dinner plates and vases. People are    
employed mixing the clay, making the   
moulds and fettling the moulded pots   
by trimming off the rough edges. The   
pottery is fired in 36m long kilns to  
a temperature of 1140C. The pots are   
sent all over Britain and abroad, as   
far away as Australia. Visitors can    
go round the factory as well as a Rare 
Breeds Survival unit, Amusement Park   
and various other shops. They get      
about 5000 visitors on a good day.
