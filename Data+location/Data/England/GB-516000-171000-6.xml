		<content>   My house is semi-detached and it is 
 number 9. I have 7 rooms - bathroom,  
 living room, kitchen, toilet and three
 bedrooms. I have a front and back     
 garden. My mum hoovers and so does my 
 sister. I do the dusting and my other 
 sister does the washing up. My mum or 
 my older sister cook the meals.       
 Sleeping - My sister and I share a    
 room. We have a duvet and two sheets. 
 We have recently had our room         
 decorated which my mum and dad did. I 
 have wallpaper and a bunk bed. We have
 one single cupboard and one double.   
 In our living room we have wallpaper  
 and upholstered furniture - a sofa, a 
 rocking chair and another non rocking 
 chair. We have a computer and a       
 stereo.In our house we have three     
 televisions, one colour and two black 
 and white. We also have a freezer,    
 tumble drier and a washing machine.   </content>
