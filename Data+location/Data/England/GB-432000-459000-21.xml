<content>



Throughout the area entertainment is provided through institutions including; the Churches, the School PTA and the Village Halls arranging a wide range of social engagements. A lottery fund of Â£25,000 was allocated to St. Oswald's Church in 1999 and this enabled improvements in the facilities within the church to be made. The Church now holds various social events over the calendar year, including a soup and sweet lunch, concerts, quiz etc. and also hosts the two Parish Meetings. Scotton Village Hall is currently raising funds to improve the facility by providing a new roof.&lt;br />&lt;br />Commercial entertainment is provided at the Public Houses in Scotton and Brearton. The Crown Public House closed in 2000 and is now a private dwelling.&lt;br />&lt;br />Most households are now online and this allows access to all media entertainments. Television provision is no longer provided through analogue transmission, turning digital in 2011.   &lt;br />
