		<title>06Recreating the "Vistas".</title>
		<content>   Work at{Studley Royal Park}by{The   
{National Trust}has started and one of 
 the major jobs will be to open up the 
 carefully "stage-managed" views that  
 the park has to offer. The views , or 
{"vistas"}as they are called, provide  
 the visitor with the chance to see the
 variety of man-made features within   
 the park. These include statues, mock 
 temples and other fascinating         
 buildings. Through the passage of     
 time, the "vistas" have closed up as  
 the avenues of hedges and trees have  
 grown together. Some of the{Yew}hedges
 by the canalised River Skell have been
 cut back to their original thickness. 
 The original landscaping records have 
 provided such distances away from the 
 riverbank. In this particular example,
 the hedges were cut back some four to 
 five metres.
