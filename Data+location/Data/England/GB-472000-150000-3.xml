		<content> The primary land cover is intensively 
 managed grassland. Hatchwood Farm on  
 the A287, Farnham road, has dairy-    
 cows, sheep, pigs and poultry. The    
 secondary land cover is residential,  
 consisting of houses, flats, shops and
 offices. These are on both sides of   
 the High Street, which is the A287,   
 Farnham road, and the B3016, the old  
 London road. The Farnham by-pass was  
 completed in 1979 and it relieves the 
 High Street of heavy, goods vehicles, 
 congestion and noise. Free parking    
 facilities are available in the High  
 Street and the Bury for shoppers.     
 Along the High Street are some fine   
 Tudor, Stuart and Georgian houses.The 
 Vicarage and Palace Gate are two of   
 the largest Tudor houses in the area. 
 Above the shops are a number of flats.
 The George Hotel and the King's Arms  
 are small, residential hotels.        </content>
