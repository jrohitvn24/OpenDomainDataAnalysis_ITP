		<title>12LANDSCAPE _ CLEE HILL AREA</title>
		<content>     From Hill Top in the NE. of our   
 area, there is a spectacular view of {
{Clee Hill}village and all of our rural
 area. Most of our area is farmland,   
 with some common land and deciduous   
 woodland. There are stone walls and   
 fences to separate the fields. Sheep  
 and cattle graze in some of the       
 fields. Houses are dotted about the   
 country_side. The traffic seems to    
 move slowly and quietly on the main   
 road.                                 
                                       
     The North of our area is higher   
 land _ the highest part is            
 approximately 430 metres above sea    
 level.{Clee Hill}village is situated  
 at 375 metres. The land slopes down to
{Knowbury}_ at 260 metres _{Whitton    
{Court}_ at 170 metres _ and{Hope      
{Bagot }_ at 180 metres.
