		<content> In Sale alone there about 25000 houses
 and the population is 43000. Most of  
 these houses are semi-detached or     
 detached houses. The only terraced    
 houses are old ones. This is how we   
 found out.                            
   We did a survey in four classes of  
 our school. We asked what kind of     
 houses they lived in. Out of 137      
 children, 77 lived in semi-detached,  
 53 lived in detached and only 7 lived 
 in terraced houses. Out of all those  
 scores we worked out the percentage of
 what kind of house they lived in. That
 means 56% lived in semi-detached, 39% 
 lived in detached and 5% in           
                                       
 terraced houses.                      
   In just our class 65% lived in semi 
 -detached, 32% lived in detached and  
 3% lived in terraced.
