		<content>          {Rusty Gates}                
  Hanging there all sad and rusty,     
  Left alone to die,                   
  No-one dares, no-one bothers,        
  After many years of hard labour,     
  Through wind and rain, hail and snow,
  Never shouting or complaining,       
  The poor old rusty gate              
                                       
         {The stone gateposts}         
The stone gateposts just standing there
  lonely.                              
Thinking maybe one day it's going to   
  be like the dodo, never to come back.
I hope that the people in the future   
  don't get rid of the old things.     
For they have been a help to mankind.  
They may be ugly and horrible.         
But give a thought for the poor things 
And how they must feel.                
                                       
                                       </content>
