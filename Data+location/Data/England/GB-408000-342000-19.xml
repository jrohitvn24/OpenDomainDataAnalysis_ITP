		<content>We continued our conversation with our 
local gentleman.He told us:            
"I arna used to this sowta thing"      
(I'm not used to this sort of thing)   
"I'm sorry I couldnee elp thee much    
mower"                                 
(I'm sorry I couldn't help you much    
more)                                  
"Say thee"                             
(See you-Goodbye)                      
                                       
                                       
 Less people talk with a broad accent  
now,than they did a generation ago.We  
think this is because people listen to 
radio and television more.People move  
around the country much more,both on   
holiday and to live in different       
places.Everybody mixes much more and   
not many people spend their lives in   
one isolated area.
