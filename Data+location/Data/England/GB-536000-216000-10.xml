		<title>10MOLES FARM.</title>
		<content> One of the the largest farms in the   
 Rib valley is {"MOLES' FARM"}. The    
 farm covers 550 acres. Most of this is
 used for growing wheat,barley,potatoes
 field beans,oats and oil-seed rape.   
 Some of the land is used to graze the 
 200 or so sheep that the farmer owns. 
 The farm does not make its own silage 
 but does grow its own hay for feeding 
 the sheep in winter. The farm is owned
 by a lady,but it is farmed for her,in 
 partnership,by a manager and 3 full   
 time workers. Getting water at the    
 farm is a problem,as it is over 100   
 feet above the river. There is a small
 water tower,which is about 70 feet up 
 to the platform. It has a bore hole of
 more than 300 feet deep. The tower    
 stores water and supplies some of the 
 nearby houses of Thundridge,as well as
 the farm itself. There are 3 ponds    
 around the farm buildings as well.    </content>
