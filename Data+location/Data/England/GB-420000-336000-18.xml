		<title>18LONGFORD W.I. - 1940</title>
		<content>    One thing stands out in my mind    
 which is how many more young mothers  
 who came with their young children.   
 Many had to walk a long distance.     
    Very few young mothers went out to 
 work then. The Women's Institution was
 the only place where we could meet. We
 used to meet once a month.            
    Very few people had cars so they   
 couldn't get into Derby as they can   
 now-a-days. The W.I meeting was the   
 event of the month.                   
    We always commenced with singing   
 Jerusalem and finished with the       
 National Anthem. We had a social half 
 hour with games after a speaker. There
 was a cookery competition. There was  
 not as much business to be done then. 
    We used to send a delegate to the  
 A.G.M. in London. We also used to have
 an annual outing to the seaside.
