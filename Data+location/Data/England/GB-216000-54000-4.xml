		<title>04THE PUNCHBOWL INN</title>
		<content> The original Punchbowl was built in   
 1240 at the same time as the church.  
 The{Lean}family owned the pub for 200 
 years.They have the original punchbowl
 (a large dish),which holds a drink    
 called punch.The cellar used to be a  
 blacksmith's shop.A long time ago the 
 kitchen used to be a{Court}and they   
 probably took the people to the church
 to the stocks for punishment.In the   
 18th and 19th centuries coaches       
 brought people to the pub to wait for 
 the ships to come into Fowey.One day a
 vicar fell down the stairs and        
 died.His ghost became a cockerel and  
 haunted the visitors.One day he was   
 seen  flying into the clome oven.The  
 door was shut and cemented up,never to
 be opened again.
