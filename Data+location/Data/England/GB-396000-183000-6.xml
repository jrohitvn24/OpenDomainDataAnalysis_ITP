		<title>06OLD BUILDINGS,SOMERFORD AREA</title>
		<content>   Opposite Great Somerford Church     
 there are two very old dwellings.The  
 first of these,Avon Cottage,has been  
 adapted from 3 small terraced cottages
 which were at least 300 years old.The 
 rear part of the buildings being the  
 most ancient.Originally the roofing   
 was thatched but during the many      
 changes over the years these have been
 replaced by Roman-style tiles.The old 
 floorboards are 27cm.wide.These joined
 cottages once served as an old inn and
 37 bags of straw were removed from the
 roof by the present owners.The inner  
 walls are of wattle and daub.         
   The second of these old houses is an
 Elizabethan timber-framed house,some  
 400 years old.The owner was probably  
 poor as the timbers are spaced far    
 apart.Since then wall-ties have       
 strengthened the walls and extensions 
 have been added at different times.   </content>
