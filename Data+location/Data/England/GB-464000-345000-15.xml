		<title>15LOWDHAM VILLAGE HALL.</title>
		<content>  The new village hall was built about 
 five years ago,almost on the site of  
 the previous hall which had to be     
 demolished.                           
  It's situated just off Main Street   
 near the Post Office and opposite The 
 Ship Public House.                    
  Inside the hall there is a large room
 which is used for parties,discos and  
 coffee mornings.It is also used by the
 local playgroup.There is also a small 
 room,a kitchen and toilets.           
  Outside,at the back of the hall,there
 are some swings and an area where     
 children practise on their B.M.X.     
 bikes.
