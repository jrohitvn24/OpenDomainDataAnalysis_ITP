		<content> Industry in this area consists of two 
 industrial estates. The first is as   
{Monckton Road}and was built as an     
 extension to existing textile mills.  
 The other is at{Thornes Wharf.}As the 
 name suggests this is next to the     
{River Calder}which has been canalised.
{(Aire and Calder Navigtion).}Some old 
 industries still exist e.g.Double 2   
 Shirts, a shipyard and an animal feed 
 merchants.                            
  However in both cases the industrial 
 estates are dominated by tertiary     
 industries. Of the 52 units, 43 are   
 tertiary. These include warehouses,   
 maintenance firms and firms which hire
 out equipment. The Thornes Wharf      
 estate, being near the city centre,   
 provides more services. The Monckton  
 Road estate, being near the M1,       
 contains more warehouses.
