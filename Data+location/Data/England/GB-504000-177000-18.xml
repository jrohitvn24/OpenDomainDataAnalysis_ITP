		<title>18GRAVEL PITS</title>
		<content> Gravel extraction is a major industry 
 in the area south of West Drayton.    
 This area had once been part of the   
 Thames River basin and has left layers
 of even deposits. All stones below 4  
 inches are extracted. They are then   
 washed and passed through mats which  
 separates them into various sizes.    
 Larger stones are put into a hop after
 which they are crushed into the right 
 size. Much of the gravel is being used
 in the construction of the M 25.      
                                       
 Great care is taken to return the pits
 to farming land. When digging pits the
 soil is removed in layers and returned
 in the same order. This is important  
 as it can effect the drainage of the  
 land and the surrounding area.
