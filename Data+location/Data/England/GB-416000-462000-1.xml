		<content> This area is predominantly a sector   
 of the valley of the River Nidd,the   
 smallest of the tributaries of the    
 Ouse.  It is mostly pastureland as the
 climate is too wet for the growing of 
 crops, although about 19% of the area 
 is original woodland.                 
 A millstone grit crag, Guisecliffe    
 dominates the central section, with   
 its steep northerly slope still       
 covered in trees, and above it to the 
 south wild open moorland. The northern
 side of the valley has a gentler slope
 and is divided with small dairy       
 farms, although smaller patches of    
 woodland still remain.                
 The original settlement was of        
 scattered hamlets and farms such as   
 Wilsill and Braisty, but in the       
 nineteenth century several industrial 
 hamlets grew up around water-powered  
 flax, later hemp, mills.              </content>
