		<title>08DUN COW LEGEND-STANION</title>
		<content>   In the church in STANION there is a 
 strange exhibit.It is a six foot long 
 bone which seems to be a whale bone.  
     Once,a long time ago,the village  
 possessed a communal cow,so huge that 
 she was able to fill any vessel into  
 which she was milked.                 
     Seeing how lucky the people of    
 STANION were,the local witch became   
 very jealous and decided to put a stop
 to their good fortune.                
     One morning before the inhabitants
 were awake,she appeared in the cow's  
 stall and reminded the cow of her     
 ability to fill any container.Then the
 witch began to to milk her into a     
 sieve.                                
     The poor Dun Cow tried to live up 
 to her reputation by producing        
 hundreds of gallons of milk.The Dun   
 Cow died from exhaustion,and the      
 people of STANION lost their Dun Cow. </content>
