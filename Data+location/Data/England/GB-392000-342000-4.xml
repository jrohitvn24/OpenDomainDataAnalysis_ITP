		<title>04Caverswall Castle</title>
		<content>     The restored Castle never remained
in the same family for more than two or
three generations.In 1811 a group of   
Benedictine Nuns took up residence and 
remained until 1850.In 1890 the Castle 
was bought by Mr W E Bowers and many   
improvements were made including a new 
east wing.In 1932 the Castle was once  
again sold to a society of nuns who    
remained in occupation until 1977.The  
Castle was then sold for 30000 pounds  
and divided between several families so
that today it remains a desirable      
family residential block.
