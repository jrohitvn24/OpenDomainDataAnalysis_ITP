		<title>19DICK BROOK</title>
		<content> Andrew Yarranton built the first      
 canalised brook in this country,at the
 place Dick Brook.There is no apparent 
 reason for it being called this,but it
 could of been named Glasshampton,but  
 then changed to Dick Brook. The brook 
 is the boundary of Astley and         
 Shrawley.                             
    Andrew Yarranton was born in the   
 parish of Astley between 1616 and     
 1619. He built Dick Brook around      
 1650-55. It was based inbetween Astley
 and the River Severn and two roads    
 crossed the brook,but maps show only  
 one of the road had a bridge.
