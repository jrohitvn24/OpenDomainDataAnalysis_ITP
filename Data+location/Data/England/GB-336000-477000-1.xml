 Our 4 x 3km. block is located towards 
 the southern end of the Cartmel       
 Valley,where the various tiny becks   
 and the River Eea converge.  The east 
 side of the valley is dominated by    
 Hampsfell - noted for its limestone   
 pavement.  Surface water is absent on 
 the fell and a spring line exists at  
 about 200 feet above sea level. The   
 river Eea leaves the valley through a 
 narrow gap by the village of Cark and 
 flows into the north end of Morecambe 
 Bay.  The land to the west side of the
 valley is formed of gently rolling    
 scars and barrows which are heavily   
 wooded with a mixture of coniferous   
 and deciduous plantings.  The village 
 of Cartmel itself, in the centre of   
 our study area, is everywhere         
 dominated by the Priory built in 1188.</content>
