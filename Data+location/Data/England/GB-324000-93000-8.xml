		<title>08"ONE DAY" by a COLYTON adult</title>
		<content> On a typical working day, I get up    
 around 6.30 am, make the bed and then 
 take my dog "Lucky" for a walk. When I
 get back from the walk, I make myself 
 a cup of coffee and get ready for     
 work. At around 7.50 am, I walk to the
 Hoechst CeramTec factory (see page 15)
 and start work at 8 o'clock. I have a 
 coffee break at 11.00 am and then work
 until lunchtime at 1.30 pm. I walk    
 home for something to eat and then    
 back to work. I leave work at 4.45 pm 
 and then maybe do some shopping if    
 necessary. When I get home, I have tea
 and take the dog for another          
 walk. After that I do any jobs, such  
 as cleaning, that need to be done     
 around the house. In the evening, if I
 am not going out to see a friend, I   
 enjoy sewing. Bedtime is usually      
 around 10.30pm.
