		<title>03Mortimer Doctor's Surgery</title>
		<content> The surgery was modernised last year. 
 The site was once the village doctor's
 garden. Waiting room and surgery were 
 in his house, amounting to an early   
 community centre. His son is now      
 principal doctor of the practice. 36  
 people work at the surgery: doctors-6;
 practice nurses-2; district nursing   
 sisters-3; dispensers-3; nursing      
 auxiliaries-3; receptionists-7(3 full-
 time); dietician-1; physiotherapist-1;
 school nurse-1; midwife-1; dispensary 
 assistants(part-time)-2; Speech       
 therapist-1(weekly); Cleaners-2;      
 chiropodist-1(monthly); Health        
 visitors-2. In one quiet week 518     
 patients visited the doctor. The      
 computerised programme calls children 
 for tetanus, diptheria, peritonitis,  
 rubella, polio and BCG injections.    
 Travellers can be injected against    
 typhoid,cholera,hepatitis and malaria.</content>
