		<content>  The{Manor House}at Donington-le-Heath
 was built in about 1280, but little   
 is known of its early history. It had 
 stone walls and a slate roof on a     
 timber frame. Later it served as a    
 farmhouse and more recently as an     
 outbuilding to house pigs. The house  
 changed very little over the years,   
 probably because the various owners   
 could not afford alterations.         
  In 1963 the house was marked as an   
{ancient monument}and in 1965          
 Leicestershire County Council bought  
 and started to restore it. The        
 building was re-roofed with Swithland 
 slate and the plaster cladding removed
 to reveal the old fireplaces. Museum  
 furniture was then installed and the  
 House now serves as a museum, in which
 visitors can obtain some idea of what 
 the Manor House was like in Medieval  
 times.                                </content>
