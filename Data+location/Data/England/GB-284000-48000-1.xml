		<title>01SOUTH OF DARTMOUTH (INTRO)</title>
		<content> Dartmouth's coast has a range of      
 beaches which unfortunately are not   
 sandy.The main attraction is Britannia
 Royal Naval college but Dartmouth also
 has boating activities and a regatta. 
 Moving further away from the town now 
 up to a hill called Jawbones you can  
 see a magnificent view of the river.  
 There are three schools in the town,  
 two primary and one secondary.We also 
 have some farms around here.Some are  
 dairy and some are no longer working. 
 Little Cotton is a farm but is also a 
 park and ride which takes you down to 
 the town.Stoke  Fleming is a small    
 village which has two pubs,some shops 
 and a school.It also has a church and 
 a caravan site.
