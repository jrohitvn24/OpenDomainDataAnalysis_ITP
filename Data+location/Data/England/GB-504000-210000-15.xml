		<title>15Holtsmere End Junior School</title>
		<content> Our school has been open just under   
 ten years. It used to be a J.M.I.     
 School but there got to be too many   
 children so they built an{Infants'    
{School}next to it. In 1979 the school 
 had over 300 pupils and will grow as  
 big again.{The Survey Block includes  
{the Junior School but not the Infants.
 --There are about{140 children}in the 
 school in 6 classes (although there is
 room for 8 classes in four 2-class    
 units). The four Lower Junior(7-9 year
 old) classes are quite small and the  
 two Upper Junior classes are bigger   
 but each have their own unit.         
 --Almost all the children live on     
{Woodhall Farm}and walk to school,     
 though some parents bring their       
 children in cars and park outside the 
 school gates. This makes it very      
 dangerous to cross Shenley Road, so we
 have a{School Crossing Patrol.        </content>
