		<title>16East Street Scheme,Bristol</title>
		<content> The class couldn't decide whether to  
 ban all traffic in East Street or to  
 have buses only or even to leave      
 things as they are.  I think that     
 kiosks would be a good idea: to put   
 some water fountains near resting     
 places so that people could feel a bit
 more relaxed.  I suggest that more    
 telephone booths and toilets should be
 provided.  More seats for old people  
 are needed.                           
 My class agrees with most of the      
 plans for Bedminster and hope that    
 Bedminster will become more popular   
 and hope that more people will enjoy  
 shopping there.
