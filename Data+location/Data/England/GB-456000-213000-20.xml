		<title>20A SCHOOL DAY (2)</title>
		<content>After playtime we come in and sit at   
our tables and sometimes do Spelling   
Workshop. For that you have cards and  
you memorise the words that are on     
them. After an hour or so we have      
dinner. Dinners are cooked at school   
and are good. At one o'clock we come in
and do library change. Then we have the
best part of the day, FOOTBALL! I am   
usually centre-forward. At the end of  
the day Mr Chivers reads us a story.   
We go home at 3.15pm.
