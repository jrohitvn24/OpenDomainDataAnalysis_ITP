		<content> This is a rural area  dominated by    
 woodland and pastoral land .The major 
 settlement is the village of Blackboys
 which has a chapel, two inns and three
 food shops, one of which is also the  
 village post office. The section also 
 covers the western edge of Cross_in _ 
 Hand village, which is about 3 km.west
 of Heathfield, and includes Cross_in_ 
 Hand windmill. It is within an Area of
 Outstanding Natural Beauty.           
   Blackboys lies at the junction of   
 the roads from Heathfield to Lewes and
 Uckfield.It stands on a steeply,      
 sloping ridge running from east to    
 west. The main industries are         
 agricultural though the nature of     
 these has changed. A number of cottage
 industries have developed and the     
 village has grown thoughout the years.
 Most residents now commute from       
 Blackboys to their place of work.     </content>
