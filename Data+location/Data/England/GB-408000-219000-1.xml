 This block in the north Cotswolds is  
 rural, with one main road, the A436   
 running through it and one village    
 called Notgrove. For the visitor there
 are Caravan club sites, a long Barrow,
 and an interesting Church with an     
 unique needlework, as well as a quiet 
 pictoresque village to walk through.  
 In the village there is a thriving    
 cricket club, an annual produce show  
 as well as a social club all using the
 village hall. The mobile library and  
 other services come to the village.   
 The children have to leave the village
 for their education. Most employment  
 is on the arable farm. The landscape  
 and wildlife is also of note.
