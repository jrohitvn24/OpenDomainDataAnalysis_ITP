		<title>15Changes For Snailbeach.</title>
		<content> At a recent public meeting, engineers 
 councillors, and landscape architects 
 presented ideas for the development of
 the Snailbeach mining area.           
 There were three strategies:{Strategy 
{One;}a minor conservation project,    
 making buildings safe, restoring old  
 engine sheds, limited access to       
 mines,landscaping spoil heaps and     
 marking footpaths.{Strategy Two;      
 provisions for tourists,car parking,  
 full restoration of buildings, bridle 
 paths on old railway routes, screening
 and landscaping, limited access to the
 mines{Strategy Three;}full development
 as a national tourist attraction like 
 Ironbridge, with working machinery    
 including the light railway, guided   
 tours , information centre, toilets,  
 cafe, shop and pub. Many were anxious 
 about the effect on the village and   
 some didn't want any changes at all.  </content>
