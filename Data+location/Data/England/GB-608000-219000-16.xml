		<content> GEORGE KEEBLE WAS BORN IN AINGERS     
 GREEN IN 1902.                        
 AT FOUR AND A HALF YEARS OF AGE I     
 WALKED THREE MILES TO THE SCHOOL IN   
 GT BENTLEY. YOU HAD TO BEHAVE         
 YOURSELVES OR YOU GOT A CANING, WITH  
 NO QUESTIONS ASKED.  WE ATE OUR       
 SANDWICHES IN THE SCHOOL SHED AND THEN
 AMUSED OURSELVES ON THE GREEN MUCH OF 
 WHICH WAS COVERED WITH GORSE.  MANY   
 GAMES TOOK PLACE SUCH AS PAPER CHASES.
 I LEFT SCHOOL IN 1915. AT THIS TIME   
 THERE WERE MANY SMALL SHOPS AND THREE 
 BAKERIES.  I WAS A TELEGRAPH BOY      
 DURING THE 1914-18 WAR, WHEN THERE    
 WERE 1000 TROOPS STATION IN THE       
 VILLAGE. IN 1921 A VILLAGE BAND WAS   
 FORMED, OF WHICH I WAS SECRETARY.     
 BEFORE 1914 THERE WERE NO CARS IN THE 
 VILLAGE, ALL TRANSPORT BEING          
 HORSE-DRAWN.                          
                                       </content>
