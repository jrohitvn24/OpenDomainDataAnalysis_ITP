 Hoddesdon has two new shopping areas  
 built in the late 1960's and early    
 seventies.                            
  The earlier of the two is the{Tower  
{Heights Shopping Precinct}and is      
 characterised by a multi-storey block 
 of private flats. Not many people     
 like the Tower Heights Precinct       
 because it has a poor collection of   
 shops and it is very cold. More people
 shop in{Fawkon Walk}because of theeasy
 parking and the variety of shops is   
 very good. Perhaps one of the         
 attractions is the presence of a      
 supermarket called Sainsburys.        
  Tower Heights Precinct was dealt a   
 blow when a fire destroyed a part of  
 the building. This caused some of the 
 large retailers to move away.
