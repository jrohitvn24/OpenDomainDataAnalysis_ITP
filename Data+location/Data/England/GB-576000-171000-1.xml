 The character of the study area is    
 partly rural, and partly urban. The   
 major land use category is agriculture
 but the skyline is dominated in places
 by Kingsnorth Power Station, and      
 electricity pylons. Although Hoo is   
 certainly a village it has grown      
 rapidly in recent years as a result of
 its proximity to nearby urban areas.  
 The last 900 years have seen many     
 changes in the area and most people   
 would agree that the rate of change is
 accelerating, with new houses, shops, 
 schools,recreational centres, and new 
 patterns of work and{life styles.     
 Inevitably people disagree as to      
 whether or not the changes have been  
 for the better or worse.
