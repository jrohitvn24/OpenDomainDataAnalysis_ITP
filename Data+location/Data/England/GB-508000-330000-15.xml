 infrequently, as does the             
 coalmerchant. A log merchant comes    
 when required. A grocer and green     
 grocer also come. The green grocer    
 lives above his store which is on the 
 A15 main road as you travel towards   
 Rippingale. It is next to a garage.   
{TRANSPORT}                            
   A National bus service runs twice   
 daily to London, about 100 miles.     
 Independent bus companies run people  
 to the various surrounding market     
 towns. Kimes, at Folkingham are 3     
 miles from Aslackby. Delaine at Bourne
 are 7 miles away. Wings at Sleaford is
 about 11 miles away.                  
   They take people to Grantham, 15    
 miles away, Bourne, 7, Sleaford, 11   
 and Boston, 25 miles away from        
 Aslackby.
