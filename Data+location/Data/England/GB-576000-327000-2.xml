		<content> In a park of 397 acres stands Houghton
 Hall built in a Palladian style       
 between 1722 &amp;1735 for Robert         
 Walpole,chief minister to George 2nd. 
 Original designs were by COLEN        
 CAMPBELL and revised by THOMAS RIPLEY,
 who also took charge of the building. 
 Locally made brick was used for the   
 shell of the house but it was sheathed
 in ashlared AISLABY sandstone,from    
 Whitby in Yorkshire.WILLIAM KENT took 
 charge of interior decoration and     
 furnishing.The stuccoist ,ARTARI, and 
 the sculptor,EYSBRACK, worked under   
 Kents direction.Tax was removed from  
 the import of mahogany in 172O and the
 original HONDURAS mahogany is to be   
 found in the doors, shutters,         
 staircase and some furniture.The      
 stable block was faced with the local 
 CARR stone chiefly quarried at        
 SNETTISHAM.                           </content>
