		<title>11WINCHAM COMMUNITY CENTRE.</title>
		<content> In 1977, Jubilee Year, a committee was
 formed in Wincham to organize local   
 celebrations. After the event, the    
 committee decided to stay together to 
 build a Community Centre. They worked 
 out a plan of campaign in three parts:
 researching regulations and grants,   
 designing the proposed building and   
 fund-raising. A piece of land next to 
 the Primary School was leased from the
 County Council and building was begun 
 in 1980. The main structure was       
 erected by a local building firm, but 
 the roof and interior were completed  
 by voluntary labour. The Centre was   
 formally opened in 1983 and won the   
 first ever Cheshire Community Council 
 Award. It is now thriving, with many  
 enthusiastic user-groups, ranging from
 Mother/Toddler groups to Computer     
 Clubs. The major user is the School,  
 which rents it every day of the week. </content>
