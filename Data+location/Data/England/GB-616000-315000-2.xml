		<content> IN THE HORSFORD AND FELTHORPE AREA WE 
 HAVE FIELDS,WOODS,ROADS,FOOTPATHS AND 
 HOUSES.OF THESE,MOST IS WOODLAND AND  
 FIELD ALMOST ENTIRELY ALTERED FROM ITS
 NATURAL STATE BY MAN'S ACTIVITIES. THE
 EXPECTED PATTERN OF GRASS AND WOODLAND
 PLANTS AND ANIMALS IS MUCH CHANGED.   
 EVEN HEDGES, ONE OF THE LAST REFUGES  
 OF NATIVE ANIMALS, ARE DISAPPEARING   
 FROM THE AREA,AS FENCES BECOME        
 PREDOMINANT.THE FEW REMAINING WOODLAND
 DEER ARE DISTURBED BY MAN,INSECTS ARE 
 DECIMATED BY AGRICULTURAL INSECTICIDES
 NATURAL WOODLAND HAS BEEN SUCCEEDED   
 BY PLANTED CONIFERS.THE LOSS OF ONE   
 PLANT OR ANIMAL COMMUNITY HAS CHAIN   
 EFFECT ON OTHERS.BIRDS,FOR EXAMPLE,   
 ARE SUFFERING FROM A GENERAL DECLINE  
 IN POPULATION.                        
 IN SUMMARY,SOME PLANTS AND ANIMALS ARE
 BEING SELECTIVELY ENCOURAGED, WHILE   
 OTHERS BECOME FEWER.                  </content>
