		<content>I live on a farm in the small parish of
Landcross.Iam going to write about 2 of
the many events that happen on our farm
-sheep dipping and corn harvest.Sheep  
dipping happens July-Aug.and Sept-Oct.:
it is compulsory.We do this to treat   
scab and maggots.The sheep dip smell al
-so keeps the flies away from the sheep
This job is very messy:when the sheep  
are put in the dip there is a small spl
-ash,and some ambitious lambs try to   
run and jump the narrow ledge,nearly al
ways falling and making a huge splash. 
When they fall they go right under so  
they don't have to be ducked.When you  
do this job you send a card to the Min 
-istry of Agriculture saying when and  
at what time.A man usually comes but   
some times he can't come.              
The next thing I shall write about is  
corn harvest.We do a lot of contracting
so time is very precious during___Cont.</content>
