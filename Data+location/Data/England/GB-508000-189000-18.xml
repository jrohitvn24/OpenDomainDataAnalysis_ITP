		<content> I get up at 7.00am .l am dressed in   
 my uniform and have eaten my          
 breakfast by 7.30am and leave for     
 school. I catch a bus to Northwood    
 Hills and walk from the bus stop to   
 school. I arrive at 8.00am. At 8.45am 
 the bell signals the start of school. 
 A register is taken before the four   
 lessons that take place before break. 
 Food is eaten at break. two lessons   
 take place before lunch break that    
 ends at 2.15pm. After lunch two more  
 lessons take place before leaving. I  
 catch the bus home and arrive at      
 4.15pm. On a Saturday I do my paper   
 round. When I get back I make         
 breakfast for everyone as they are    
 still asleep. I watch Breakfast TV or 
 TV AM, which include news, weather and
 celebrity interviews. Later I play for
 Northwood  Football Club,have lunch   
 and then shop and have dinner.        </content>
