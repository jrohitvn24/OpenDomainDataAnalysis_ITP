		<title>07MOATS IN SAMPFORD</title>
		<content> There are many moats in the Sampfords.
  There are more moats between         
 Cambridge and Braintree than anywhere 
 else in the country.  Nobody thinks   
 that these were used for defensive    
 purposes.  I noted they were used to  
 stop livestock escaping from the farm 
 and for the livestocks drinking water.
 Also the moats could be used for      
 washing water for clothes and for the 
 people themselves.  The water from the
 moats could be used for many other    
 domestic purposes.  The earth from the
 moat would be used for the banks.  The
 moat also enclosed the farm.  There   
 are several moats in our rectangle.   
 One is at Gt. Brockholds and another  
 at Ellis Green.  Cattle raiding was   
 also popular and the moat ensured that
 fewer people needed to guard the      
 cattle.                               
                                       </content>
