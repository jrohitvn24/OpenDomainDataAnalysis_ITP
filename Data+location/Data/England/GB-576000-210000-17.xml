		<content> To give an idea of what life is like  
 in Hatfield Peverel and the           
 surrounding area in the 1980's we     
 thought it would be interesting to ask
 local people their views. To the      
 question, "Do you like living in      
 Hatfield Peverel?" we received a      
 variety of responses.  Most people    
 said yes they did; they said they     
 liked it for the quietness, the       
 nearness of the the countryside and   
 the friendliness of the people .  To  
 the question, "Do you think the       
 amenities in the village are          
 adequate?" we received a number of    
 replies.  Nearly everybody said that  
 we had enough amenities as it is      
 although one man thought the village  
 needed a chemist.  One elderly man    
 thought that the social activities in 
 the village for old people was good   
 but there was little for the young.   </content>
