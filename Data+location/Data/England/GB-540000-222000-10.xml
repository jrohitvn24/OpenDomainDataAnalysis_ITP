   In this area the main use of the    
 land is for agricultural              
 farming,which consist of arable       
 farming and live stock farming.       
   The main crops produced from the    
 land are wheat,barley and oil_seed    
 rape.                                 
   As well as the arable farming most  
 farmers keep livestock as well,for    
 something to fall back on if the crops
 fail.                                 
   As a result of this the area is made
 up of very large areas of grazing land
 ,with some fields as large as{20}     
 acres.                                
   There is also an extensive network  
 of public footpaths and bridalways.
