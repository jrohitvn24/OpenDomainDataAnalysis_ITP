{At Home on Saturday.}                 
 On Saturday I wake up at about 5.00 am
 and read until 6.15 am and then I     
 watch TV-AM. After that has finished I
 play on my Spectrum computer using my 
 T.V. as a monitor. The game that I    
 normally play is Atic Atac. For my    
 Spectrum computer I have a printer and
 a joystick and two joystick           
 interfaces. I play on the computer    
 until about 1.00 pm. For lunch I      
 normally have bacon and chips. In the 
 afternoon I sometimes play with my    
 radio controlled car, then at 5.50 pm 
 I have tea which is usually a slice of
 toast. Then I watch television until

 wear a pair of jeans, a sweat shirt   </content>
