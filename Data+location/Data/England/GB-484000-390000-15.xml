		<title>15Children in Corringham</title>
		<content> Children in Corringham do not really  
 have a lot to do. There is no park but
 we do have a big playing field, were  
 in summer we play cricket and in      
 winter, football. Sometimes we also   
 play tennis in the school playground. 
  In the winter we go to the youth     
 club, we play table tennis, pool or   
 justlisten to records. Occasionally,  
 they arrange trips to Sheffield,ice   
 skating or a disco.                   
  Most days, after tea, we all meet at 
 the school wall, this has been the    
 meeting place for children in         
 Corringham for generations.           
  There is a bus that comes to pick us 
 up for school, in Gainsborough. It    
 picks us up at 8.00 a.m we get to     
 school about 8. 20 a.m.               
  Village life is a lot quieter than in
 the towns and Corringham is no        
 exception.                            </content>
