		<content> Public Transport is limited. The      
 railway line from Ashford to          
 Canterbury passes through but does    
 not stop between Wye and Chilham. The 
 East Kent Bus Company run a fairly    
 regular bus service on the one main   
 road from Ashford to Canterbury which 
 runs through Bilting.  Most other     
 roads are country lanes, some quite   
 narrow in places so that wider strips 
 have been made to allow traffic to    
 pass. Crundale has no actual bus      
 service but the post bus has seats and
 , after delivering the mail,will take 
 people to Canterbury at 9.00am,       
 returning with the afternoon mail.    
 Other travel has to be by car,        
 bicycle, tractor or on foot.
