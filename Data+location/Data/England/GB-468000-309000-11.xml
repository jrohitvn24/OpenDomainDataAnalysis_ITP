		<title>11LIFE IN BARSBY (2)</title>
		<content>  On a current landuse map it is       
 noticeable how field shapes have      
 changed over the years. theey have    
 changed from being small, regular     
 shaped fields often bounded by ditches
 rather than hedges. Many of the       
 residents in Barsby are concerned     
 about the detrimental affect this has 
 on wildlife which would normally      
 inhabit hedgerows.                    
  Bicycle used to be the most important
 form of transport, but it is of course
 the car which is now the main form of 
 transport. it is noticeable how clean 
 Barsby is and how well looked after   
 the houses and the buildings are. Up  
 to now there are  no signs of         
 vandalism of grafitti.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
