		<content>     BMX riding is one of the latest   
 and most expensive children's crazes  
 of our time. A BMX bicycle is built   
 more strongly than its conventional   
 counterpart in order to sustain the   
 extra stress and strain put upon it.  
     One of the stunts a skilful rider 
 can perform is to lift the front wheel
 clear of the ground and pedal along on
 the rear wheel only. Similarly it is  
 possible to rock the machine from     
 front to rear wheel; balancing the    
 machine on each wheel for several     
 seconds. This is done without the     
 usual forward motion necessary to keep
 an ordinary bicycle in balance.       
     The wheels of BMX bikes are       
 moulded out of metal alloy, thus      
 combining strength with lightness. The
 spoked wheel of an ordinary road      
 bicycle would buckle and collapse if  
 the above stunts were tried on it.    </content>
