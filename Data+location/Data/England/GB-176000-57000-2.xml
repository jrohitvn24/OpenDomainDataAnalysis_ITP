{The Legend of St. Cuthbert &amp; Holywell}
                                       
 Recorded in the Domesday of lO86 as   
 Chenowen, the name Cubert originates  
 from the Saxon Cuth-bert meaning      
 knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  
 Several legends exist about the origin
 of both Cubert and Holywell, but the  
 most popular tells how in 955 AD the  
 relics of St. Cuthbert (Bishop) were  
 being taken to Ireland by the monks of
 Durham as they fled from the invading 
 Danes.  A storm drove them onto the   
 Cornish Coast at Holywell.  It is said
 from the moment the relics rested on  
 the rocks the well immediately had    
 healing qualities.  In memory of their
 being saved the monks are said to have
 built the original church and given it
 its name.                             
                                       </content>
