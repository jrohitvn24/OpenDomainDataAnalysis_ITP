		<content>   At Hollymount farm strange things   
 have happened.There was a rumour of a 
 tomb being found whilst digging the   
 foundations for a shed for cows.The   
 owner found the tomb of James Elton   
 who was buried in the 16th Century.   
 There is also a rumour about a tunnel 
 from Hollymount farm to Brandlesholme 
 Hall.                                 
   The ghost of Walshaw Hall appears   
 when there is a smell of mushrooms.   
 Usually it is in the computer room.The
 computer room is not its original size
 because part of the room has been     
 walled off, and no-one can get in (or 
 out! )
