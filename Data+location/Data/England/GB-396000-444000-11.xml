		<title>11AN ORDINARY DAY</title>
		<content>   My dad rises at 6.00am.He starts    
 work at Meritt and Fryers at 7.30am.  
 and finishes at 5.30pm.As dad has all 
 the office keys he has to be early.One
 day dad said,"I have never had  so    
 many cups of tea in my life.Every time
 somebody comes in Vicky,my secretary  
 says,'Would you like a cup of tea?'"  
   In the afternoon dad checks up on   
 all the bills he has to pay out for   
 all the goods he buys for the         
 shelves.In the later afternoon he     
 cashes up all the money.In a day      
 Meritt and Fryers take about Â£2500.   
   My dad's work is in the             
 'Do-it-yourself'store,the timber yard,
 and builder's yard where there are    
 cement and tiles for building,and a   
 sand and grit yard.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
