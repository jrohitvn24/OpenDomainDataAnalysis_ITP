		<content> The USAF Base, Woodbridge, has an Arts
 and Craft Centre staffed by an English
 Principal and six American assistant  
 lecturers, some part-time. The courses
 are of variable length and include    
 pottery, modelling, mould-pouring,    
 some sculpture,woodwork, frame-making,
 painting, calligraphy, heat-pressed   
 printing (T-shirt transfers), brass-  
 rubbing from replicas, stained glass  
 and macrame. An average of 50-80 man- 
 hours a day are recorded over a month,
 some students only attending for short
 periods. The work here is unlike that 
 in any reputable English College and  
 seems to be directed towards speedy   
 commercialised production. The local  
 rural population practice various arts
 and crafts, including book illust-    
 ration, poetry, portrait painting,    
 tapestry work and knitting.
