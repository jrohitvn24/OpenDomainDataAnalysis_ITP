		<content>      The oldest part of the school was
used in the 19th century.It has only   
two classrooms and a school house.     
Later two more stages were built on to 
the old school.The first was built in  
1970 ,it has got a hall ,canteen and   
two classrooms.The last was built in   
1976 and it consists of two classrooms.
Altogether we have 5 classrooms but 1  
is used as a craft room.               
We can have school meals or  we  can   
bring sandwiches.The school has  2     
playgrounds and a large  field with a  
football pitch.We have a library which 
is maintained by volunteer parents.    
we come to the school in the year we   
are 5 and we leave when we  are 11     
and then we go to Guilsborough county  
school.
