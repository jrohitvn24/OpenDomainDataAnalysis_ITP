		<title>04CRACKLEY WOODS</title>
		<content>Crackley Wood is situated just outside 
Kenilworth. It covers 60 acres. A      
disused railway track runs through the 
wood on an embankment. There are many  
trees and animals of which you can see 
the prints. There is a clearing in     
which are picnic tables. There is an   
old railway bridge. The footpaths get  
very muddy in winter, and the roots of 
trees trip you up. The many small ponds
and ditches are mostly full of mud.    
There is a fence which has narrow      
entances to stop horses. There are     
horse and dog droppings everywhere.    
There are lots of small ferns and      
fungi. A road runs beside the wood with
lay-bys here and there where you can   
park. In the spring the bluebells are  
in flower and the woods are  very      
pretty.
