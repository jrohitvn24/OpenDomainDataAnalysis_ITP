 for just over 50 years.               
 "When I was young I had a Saturday    
 gardening job which paid 2 old pence  
 an hour.                              
 In the evenings we went to the club on
 the recreation ground to play         
 billards.Or we would cycle to the     
 tin-shed roofed cinema in Heathfield. 
 You could hear the trains running     
 through the tunnel underneath.Now     
 people watch television or travel in  
 their cars to find entertainment.The  
 railway station and cinema have gone. 
    We had few holidays, whilst today  
 people travel all over the world.We   
 played football and cricket.Blackboys 
 used to have a windmill.One old boy   
 could hit a ball for six over the top 
 of it!Today we have badminton, squash,
 stoolball and lots more."    (Angela  
 Baker,Catrin Lewis, David Robbins.)   </content>
