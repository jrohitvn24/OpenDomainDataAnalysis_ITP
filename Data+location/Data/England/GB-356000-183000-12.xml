		<title>12ANNUAL EVENTS IN PILNING</title>
		<content>{Pilning Carnival.                     
 This is an annual event previously    
 held on May Day but changed to June   
 hoping for warmer weather. Some months
 before a committee meets to arrange a 
 programme. A band leads the procession
 through the village to the Playing    
 Fields. The May Queen and attendants  
 on a float are followed by floats     
 decorated by groups such as Brownies, 
 Playgroup, Pilning School and Village 
 Players. After the floats are judged  
 the stalls and side-shows open, run by
 many including Mothers and Toddlers   
 Club, Labour Group, Playgroup and Cat 
 Neutering Society. As the band plays  
 in the Village Hall a puppet show and 
 talent competitions are held. Teas are
 provided by the wives of the cricket  
 club members. Profits are for the     
 village hall fund.
