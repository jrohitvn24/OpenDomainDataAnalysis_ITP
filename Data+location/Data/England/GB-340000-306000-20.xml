		<title>20ROAD TRAFFIC ALONG THE A488</title>
		<content> The roads in the area are all well    
 surfaced but still narrow except for  
 the A488 and care is needed when      
 vehicles pass. The A488 road is 22feet
 wide.It carries a wide variety of     
 traffic from agricultural tractors to 
 38tonne articulated lorries.There is a
 steady flow of traffic throughout the 
 day with a constant stream between,   
 7.30am and 8.30am and 4.30pm and      
 5.30pm in the afternoon.              
 This year there is controversy over   
 the proposed expansion of Callow      
 Quarry, Minsterley. In order to       
 justify the expenditure the company   
 will need to remove up to 360000 tons 
 of stone per annum. This will greatly 
 increase the heavy goods traffic using
 the village routes.                   
 This block has been produced by the   
 boys and staff of Cruckton Hall       
 School, Cruckton, Shrewsbury.         </content>
