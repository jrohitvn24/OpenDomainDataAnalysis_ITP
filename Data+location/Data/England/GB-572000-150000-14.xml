		<title>14Hamlet Wood</title>
		<content> Hamlet Wood is an area in Coxheath    
 that belongs to the Scouting movement.
 It is used by Scouts, Cubs, Brownies  
 and Guides from the Maidstone area.   
 This use usually consists of making   
 use of the camping facilities at the  
 site but it is also used for sports   
 events and camp-fire evenings.        
                                       
 The wood is situated in Stockett Lane,
 Coxheath and covers quite a large     
 area.  There is a mixture of deciduous
 and coniferous trees with a fair      
 amount of grassland for various       
 activities.  There is a hut on the    
 site with toilet facilities and a     
 warden lives in an adjacent property.
