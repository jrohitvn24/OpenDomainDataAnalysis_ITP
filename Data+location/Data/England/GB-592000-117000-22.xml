<title>22Rye Harbour Update 2011</title>
<content>

All the features described in 1986 are still in place except that there is now only one (very good) shop but we have in addition the Avocet Gallery and  cafe  - the village itself has expanded with additional housing built behind the Village Hall, as well as various in-fill projects. The population has increased, being nearly 600.&lt;br />&lt;br />The river is still very important as a dominant feature and the flood defences have been massively upgraded in the last 3 years with an earth bund extending to Winchelsea Beach. The Wharf is an active industrial and storage centre, ships up to 2000 tons loading and unloading ballast, aggregate and grain cargos. The lifeboat station was upgraded in 1995 to a modern facility and the main jetty was replaced in 2010   &lt;br />
