		<content>        HINSTOCK BY-PASS               
 The  By_Pass was opened in 1983.      
  It carries the heavy traffic of the  
 A41 Merseyside to Midlands link.      
 It cost nearly one million pounds to  
 constuct.                             
   The old road used to go right passed
 the school.                           
 The school is one of the few schools  
  that have double glazing. This is to 
 cut out the noise. Now the school is  
 much quieter.                         
   We did a traffic survey to see how  
 many vehicles would have gave passed  
 the school if the By_pass had not been
 built.In a half hour period we counted
 one hundred and eighty vehicles       
 travelling on the new road. This      
 averages one vehicle every ten        
 seconds. Many of the vehicles are     
 lorries. We feel the By-Pass has      
 greatly helped our school.            </content>
