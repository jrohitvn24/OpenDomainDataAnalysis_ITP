		<content>   Continuing our walk to the base of  
 the slope, wood anemones, dog's       
 mercury and bluebells, soon to be in  
 flower, were thriving.  We crossed the
 ancient track marked by an earthbank  
 and ditch, and looked at the pollarded
 trees serving as an ownership boundary
 marker.  Beyond we moved into the     
 calcareous hornbeam/sessile oak       
 community.  Loose patches of Thamnium 
 alopecurum, a moss forming tight green
 ball, unattached to the floor were    
 very noticeable.  Butchers' broom was 
 common, also the upright leaves of    
 stinking iris.  We stopped to look at 
 the dark evergreen leaves of Daphne   
 laureola, some field maple stools and 
 festoons of clematis stems.  On       
 through the newly coppiced area we    
 went to see the large wild service    
 tree and came across some parasite    
 toothwort.                            </content>
