		<content>{The Donkey Stud-farm}is owned and run 
 by Mrs.E.J.Pinnegar at her home on    
 Gambles Lane Woodmancote.             
   There is a 4.5 acre paddock, half of
 which is rented to other donkey       
 owners. The farm began in 1967 when   
 the family bought their first donkey  
 as a pet. Now there are 8 donkeys     
 including the stallion 'Teddy-bear'   
 who is about to retire in favour of   
 one of his sons.                      
   Mrs. Pinnegar and her family have   
 taken their donkeys all over the      
 country to appear in shows and driving
 competitions using the attractive     
 hand-made cart with the gold-leaf     
 finish.The rafters of one room in the 
 house are lined with winners' rosettes
 and the cupboards are loaded with     
 trophies and photographs.             
 Mrs.Pinnegar's cart has been filmed   
 for B.B.C. television.                </content>
