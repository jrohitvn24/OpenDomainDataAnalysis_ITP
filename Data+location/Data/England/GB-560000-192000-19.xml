		<title>19DAY IN THE LIFE OF: A PUPIL</title>
		<content>  After being forced to rise at 7am, I 
 quickly perform all the necessary     
 actions (breakfast etc.). That done, I
 set off at around 8.15.               
  Reaching school at 8.45, I rush to   
 the form room for registration. At    
 9.10 lessons start, today's being     
{Geography.}A quick break from 10.20 to
 10.40, is allowed before setting off  
 to the English department for an      
 enthralling lesson of{Literature.}35  
 minutes later sees me making my way to
 Maths. After slaving away for the next
 half-hour, the bell rings, signalling 
 Chemistry, which usually means I've   
 fogotten to bring in my Homework. at  
 1.05, the bell again rings for lunch, 
 during which I will go into town.     
    Registration is once more called at
 2.05. Ten minutes later I am due for  
 Computer Studies, which will keep me  
 busy until 3.25, the final bell ring. </content>
