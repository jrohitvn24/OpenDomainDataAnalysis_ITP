		<content>The new Sywell Primary School was      
opened in 1964. Sixty-two children     
attend. School starts at 8.55am and    
finishes at 3.30pm. At the start of    
school, the brass bell from the Old    
School is rung and we walk to our      
classrooms. The bell used to hang over 
the old school but it was taken down in
1981 so that we could use it. It now   
hangs on the wall at the back of the   
school. About half the children have   
school dinners which are cooked at the 
school. They cost 60p. Dinners are also
cooked here for Boughton School and    
Overstone School. They are collected   
and delivered by van. There are two    
cooks. The rest of the children bring  
packed lunches. They can buy a drink   
(orange, milk shake, coffee or         
chocolate) which costs 5p and is       
ordered at the start of the day. There 
are two lunchtime supervisors.         </content>
