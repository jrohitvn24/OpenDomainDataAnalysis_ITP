		<content> The area is almost entirely           
 residential, having a mixture of      
 villas with terraced streets but      
 little open space. There are also     
 several shopping areas. Little        
 evidence of the resort remains other  
 than amusement arcades, small funfairs
 and a concert hall. The pier has been 
 closed for many years and the ferry   
 trip to Liverpool is a thing of the   
 distant past. The area's residential  
 importance has been increased by the  
 redevelopment, for housing, of the    
 area where New Brighton Tower once    
 stood, and by the sub-division of     
 larger villas. Plans exist for the    
 development of a theme park in the    
 promenade area, while extensive       
 engineering works to modify the tidal 
 flow and to improve coastal defences  
 are nearing completion.
