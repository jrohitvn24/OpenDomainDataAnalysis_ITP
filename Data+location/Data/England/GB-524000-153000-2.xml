		<title>02Lifestyles in Kingswood area</title>
		<content>     This is a very quiet area with    
 well-to-do folk living in it, many of 
 them{retired.}They pay high rates and 
 live in expensive houses. They have   
 mainly quiet{hobbies}and pass-times   
 such as horse riding, golf and        
 gardening. Kingswood is the most      
{expensive}part of the area with very  
 big houses, costing as much as a      
 quarter of a million pounds. While    
 Lower Kingswood has slightly more     
 modest housing (but still quite       
 expensive by national standards).     
     The people in the Kingswood area  
 definitely have an easy life compared 
 with many people in Britain today. As 
 most of the land in the area is used  
 for{farming,}most people{commute}to   
 London for their work.                
   { Car ownership}in the area is above
 average. Almost every household owns a
 car and many own more than one.       </content>
