		<content> IN OUR SCHOOL WE HAVE 47 CHILDREN.    
 THEY COME FROM THE VILLAGES OF WEST   
 TANFIELD, THORNBOROUGH, NOSTERFIELD   
 AND WELL.  MANY CHILDREN TRAVEL BY BUS
 SOME BY TAXI, SOME BY CAR AND 12 WALK 
 TO SCHOOL.  IN THE MORNING WHEN WE    
 COME INTO SCHOOL, WE HAVE ASSEMBLY    
 WHICH IS TAKEN BY THE SCHOLARS OR THE 
 TEACHERS, BUT ON TUESDAYS IT IS TAKEN 
 BY MR EYLES, THE RECTOR.  BESIDES THE 
 NORMAL SCHOOL WORK, WE HAVE MANY EXTRA
 ACTIVITIES.  IN THE SUMMER TERM WE    
 HAVE PRIZE GIVING AND BOOKS ARE       
 PRESENTED TO THOSE WHO HAVE DONE GOOD 
 WORK.  WE ALSO HAVE A DANCING FESTIVAL
 AND GARDEN PARTY TOGETHER WITH A      
 SPORTS DAY WITH EVERY CHILD TAKING    
 PART.  EACH YEAR THE OLDER CHILDREN   
 ARE TAKEN ON EDUCATIONAL OUTINGS WHICH
 HAVE INCLUDED TRIPS TO LONDON,        
 CAMPING,HIKING AND EVEN FLYING. THE   
 INFANTS HAVE A HALF DAY OUTING.       </content>
