		<title>06KING ALFRED</title>
		<content>      There is a statue of King Alfred 
 in the centre of the town, put up in  
 1911.  King Alfred was closely        
 connected with Pewsey.  He owned a    
 manor here and also much of the land  
 in and around the village in the ninth
 century.                              
      After one of his successful      
 battles against the Danes he returned 
 to Pewsey where his wife was staying. 
 That was on Holy Cross Day, September 
 14th.  He declared that a feast day in
 Pewsey forever and it is said to be   
 the origin of Pewsey Carnival still   
 held during this week each year.
