		<content> Ladock Wood is owned by The Duchy of  
 Cornwall. The trees that are grown    
 come from North America:{Douglas Fir, 
{Western Hemlock, Norway Spruce and    
{Larch.}When they are planted thay are 
 two years old and they are planted in 
 a{fifty year rotation.                
 When the trees are cut down they are  
 lifted by a crane and put onto a      
 tractor and trailer which takes the   
 wood to Lostwithiel Sawmill. The wood 
 is sold to make{fencing stakes, gates 
{and farm buildings.                   
                                       
 A lot of activities go on in the      
 woods like{orienteering, bird         
{watching, searching for butterflies   
{and fungi.}There is also{pheasant     
{shooting}and{horse riding.}The public 
 are allowed to walk around in the     
 woods as long as they keep to the
