		<title>11The Local Police</title>
		<content> Our local policeman works from the one
 main police station at Cromhall. He   
 covers an area of 8,600 acres         
 containing 4,000 people. He has been  
 the local constable for 18 months. In 
 that time the most serious crimes have
 been a robbery in Charfield Post      
 Office, burglary in Cromhall, and     
 vandalism. He has had to deal with    
 some serious road accidents, but none 
 involving serious injuries.           
 He enjoys his job. He has previously  
 worked in Bristol, covering an area of
 housing estates, and at Almondsbury in
 the motorway patrol police. He sees   
 his job at Charfield as helping       
 people, as when he takes children for 
 cycling proficiency, and preventing   
 crime.                                
 He works an eight hour shift including
 three out of four weekends, totalling 
 40 hours per week.                    </content>
