		<content> When {Askern}was a{Spa}town people    
 used to come to bathe in the lake, as 
 it was supposed to be good for them.  
 The{lake}has an area of just over one 
 hectare and is very deep, being fed by
 underground springs. The lake used to 
 have bath houses around it. Now they  
 have been knocked down. A cafe and    
 boathouse has been built. This is a   
 list of all the birds on the lake:    
 mallard, coot, mute swan and Aylesbury
 ducks. Now the lake is mainly used for
{fishing}and{boating.}The fish in the  
 lake are perch; pike; tench; roach and
 carp. There are two islands on the    
 lake where the birds can lay their    
 eggs and feed on insects. At the back 
 of th e lake. There is a BMX track and
 a golf course. There are benches for  
 people to sit on round the lake.
