		<title>08THE SWAFFHAMS CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content> The Swaffhams Cricket Club was formed 
 two years ago when the Swaffham       
 Bulbeck club joined with the Swaffham 
 Prior club.They joined forces because 
 both teams were finding it hard to    
 find enough players.                  
 Home matches are played on the lovely 
 Swaffham Bulbeck recreation ground,the
 Denny,where the team has the use of   
 the pavilion.                         
 Games are played in midweek and at the
 weekends.Nearly all the players come  
 from one or other of the two villages.
 Every year the club puts on a very    
 popular six-a-side tournament.
