		<title>13WANSFORD'S POLICEMAN</title>
		<content>  The village policeman is a member of 
 the Cambridgeshire Constabulary which 
 is split into two divisions: the north
 division has its headquarters in      
 Peterborough and the Wansford area is 
 in a sub-division of this area. The   
 policeman's home in Wittering doubles 
 as his police station.                
  The area which is policed by ten     
 officers covers 65,000 acres and      
 although the ten policemen are        
 responsible for traffic in their area 
 there are Traffic Department patrols  
 too.                                  
  The most common crime in the Wansford
 area is burglary. An important part of
 the policeman's work, though is crime 
 prevention, and he does this by       
 talking to groups of people in        
 schools, parish councils and other    
 organizations.
