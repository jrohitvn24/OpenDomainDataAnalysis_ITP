		<title>05HOME LIFE-A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>  When we get to school I watch boys   
 playing,then I throw a ball until the 
 whistle goes.Our school is on two     
 sites,one on each side of the road.At 
 12.10 p.m it is dinner.The canteen is 
 on the other side of the road.Usually 
 I stay for sandwiches but today I am  
 going home.We are having a cooked meal
 tonight so dinner is only sandwiches. 
  School begins again at 1.30 p.m but  
 we go earlier.Afternoon lessons finish
 at 3.40.I walk home with some friends.
 Dad comes home at 5.15 and we all have
 a drink.At about 5.45 we have tea.It  
 is chips and beans.After tea my mum   
 takes my brother to cubs.At 7.30 my   
 brother comes home.We both have a cup 
 of coffee around 9.30 then we go to   
 bed.I read a book until 10.15 then go 
 to sleep.
