		<content>{ Housing Estates:}There are plans to  
 build 3 housing estates in Reydon to  
 counteract the lack of low_cost       
 housing. Part of the designated area  
 is within the{Suffolk Heritage Coast  
{Preservation Area}containing sites of 
 special scientific interest and areas 
 of outstanding natural beauty. These  
 houses would probably be bought by    
 commuters,and some would become second
 homes.                                
                                       
{ Coastal Erosion:}There is extensive  
 cliff erosion by the sea as the cliff 
 is soft sand_stone.The coastline      
 retreats several metres each year.    
{Easton Bavents used to be the most    
{easterly point of the British Isles:  
 It is fast disappearing. Most major   
 sea_defences stop just north of       
 Southwold;only a little limited work  
 is proposed for Easton Bavents.       </content>
