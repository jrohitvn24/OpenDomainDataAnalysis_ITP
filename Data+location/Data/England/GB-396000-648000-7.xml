{Double Dare Hopscotch.}               
 Two captains and two teams of at least
 3 in each team are needed.            
 Draw out a pattern of nine squares    
 alternately putting one square then   
 two squares until nine squares have   
 been drawn.  Toss a coin to see which 
 team goes first.                      
 Throw any small stone lying around to 
 land on a number. Jump into the       
 squares first one foot then two feet, 
 alternating, and missing the square   
 the stone landed in. If your foot     
 accidentally lands in this square you 
 are out and the captain of the other  
 team double dares you to carry out a  
 difficult task. If you carry out the  
 task you are awarded a point for your 
 team.
