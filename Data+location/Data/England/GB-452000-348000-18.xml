		<content> The last few years have seen the      
 growth of a number of flourishing new 
 clubs and societies.Musically,these   
 include an Amateur Operatic           
 Society,an Ecumenical Church Choral   
 Society, Barber Shop(ladies and       
 mens).There are three Amateur Dramatic
 Societies, a Photographic Society,Cage
 Birds and Flower Arranging.           
 Interest too has been shown in the    
 heritage of the past and a new        
 Heritage Society(1984) has regular    
 attendance at monthly meetings of over
 50. Traditional groups                
 include:W.I.,Rotary,Round Table and a 
 Masonic Lodge.For young people, apart 
 from Swimming / Football Clubs and    
 Church Youth CLubs, the new Leisure   
 Centre and discos at the Miners       
 Welfare, there is a singular lack of  
 provision for the youth of the town.  
 Allotment gardens are flourishing.    </content>
