		<content>The landscape of this Domesday Block is
very picturesque.    It is dominated by
the River  Nene which  meanders through
eight of the  twelve kilometre squares.
This  fertile  valley  area  supports a
number of  farms  given  mainly to crop
growing although there  is some  animal
husbandry. There is a gravel quarry but
otherwise no other industry in the area
other than farming.                    
                                       
The whole area  contains parts of three
villages.  Populations, at present, are
reasonably stable.     Apart form those
engaged  directly  in farming, many  of
the local  residents find occupation in
neighbouring  towns,  such  as  Oundle,
Peterborough and Corby.
