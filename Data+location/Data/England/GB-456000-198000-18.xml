		<title>18ST. KATHERINE'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>CHISELHAMPTON                          
When the parish was united with        
Stadhampton in the mid 1970's this     
church was declared redundant on 1st.  
February 1977. It is in the care of the
Redundant Churches Fund. A key is kept 
by the owner of Church Farm so that    
visitors can have access. Services can 
be held with special permission. At    
present the church is closed for repair
to roof and bell turret. It is a fine  
example of an C18 country church and   
remains largely unaltered. Most of the 
fittings inside are original.          
30 years ago the clock faces on the    
three sides of the bell turret were    
repainted light blue with gold Roman   
numerals and scrolls. They clearly show
the date when the church was built ... 
1762.
