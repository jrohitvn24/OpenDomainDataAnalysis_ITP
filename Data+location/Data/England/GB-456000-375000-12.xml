		<content>     The 4th Duke of Newcastle left    
 only the stable yard and the          
 foundations, converting one wing to a 
 modest home.In 1890 the 7th Duke sold 
 it to Sir John Robinson and his great 
 _ nephew, Capt. Farr, whose family    
 still own it.                         
     The large Stable Yard has a       
 triumphal arch at one end with a      
 cupola crowned archway at the other.  
 This leads through into the grand     
 court to the front of the Manor. The  
 ground floor designed by Paine acts as
 an impressive garden wall. The wall is
 crowned with the urns which were on   
 the top of the demolished building .  
     This, with the triumphal arch and 
 many Doric columns, bring to mind past
 glory. The great pediment (designed by
 the Duchess and carved by Collins) has
 been rebuilt and stands in the        
 hen-run.                              </content>
