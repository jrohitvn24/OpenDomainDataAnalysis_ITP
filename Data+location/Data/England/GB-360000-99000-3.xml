		<content> There are 268 on the Electoral roll   
 1985.                                 
 Of these 33 are children of School    
 age, 24 of whom attend state schools. 
 There are 13 children under school    
 age.                                  
 There are 145 households in the       
 Parish. More than three quarters of   
 the homes are owner occupied. 4 of the
 houses belong to 2nd home owners and  
 therefore hardly ever used. 2 of the  
 old cottages are used for Bed &amp; Break-
 fast accomodation and there is also a 
 Public House (Pub)  called the        
 Greyhound, where it is possible to    
 stay.  This means there are always    
 visitors wandering about   enjoying   
 this lovely valley.
