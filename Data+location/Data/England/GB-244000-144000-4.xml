		<title>04MORTEHOE METHODIST CHURCH</title>
		<content>     Mortehoe Methodist Church at the  
 top of Chapel Hill was constructed of 
 local stone and opened in 1901.  Rev. 
 Thomas Rees laid the foundation stone 
 and a fine stained glass window ws    
 erected in his memory.  The original  
 organ purchased in memory of the men  
 who died in the First World War is    
 still in use today.                   
     Mortehoe Methodist Church is      
 included in the Ilfracombe Circuit    
 with the Superintendent Minister      
 residing in Ilfracombe.  As the       
 Methodist Ministry is of an itinerant 
 nature this involves a changeover of  
 ministers every 5-8 years.  The       
 present membership is 12.
