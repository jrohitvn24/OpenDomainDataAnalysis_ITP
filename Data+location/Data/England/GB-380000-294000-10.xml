		<title>10A FARMER'S WIFE NEAR SEISDON</title>
		<content>   A farmer' wife, whose husband and   
son work the family farm near Abbot's  
Castle Hill described her life.   She  
has always worked hard, looking after  
the house and garden and helping with  
the farm, especially the poultry and,  
until recently, the dairy herd.   Now  
they keep only one cow for milk.   The 
farm consists mainly of arable land    
which yields good crops.               
   She loves farming and country life  
and is obviously contented with her    
lot.   She ackowledges the difficulties
                                       
of shopping, getting to the doctor,    
etc. and has to rely on her husband or 
son to take her as she no longer       
drives a car.   For this reason too    
she has had to stop attending Women's  
Institute meetings in nearby Trysull.  
However, she enjoys handicrafts and    
spends her evenings knitting,          </content>
