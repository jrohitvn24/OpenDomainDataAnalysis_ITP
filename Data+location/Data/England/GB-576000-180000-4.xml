		<title>04A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content>{                                      
 My day starts at 7-15 when I have to  
 get up.I eat my breakfast and read the
 paper. After breakfast I get dressed  
 and washed. When my bag is ready I go 
 to school. We have an assembly about  
 the life boats and then we go back to 
 class. The first break has gone so we 
 go out to play. After play we do some 
 more work until the lunch break.I     
 stayed in to do my picture of the     
 lake.When the bell goes again everyone
 comes into class and starts to work   
 until the last break bell goes and    
 then we all go out to play.There are  
 crisps and drinks being sold.Sir      
 says,after play,that we would have    
 cricket but Rebbeca and I were doing a
 collage so we stayed in to do that. At
 3.15 they returned,changed,put up our 
 chairs,when the bell went we all went 
 happily home.                         </content>
