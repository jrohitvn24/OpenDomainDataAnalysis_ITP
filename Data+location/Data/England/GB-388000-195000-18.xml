		<title>18BELIEF &amp; WORSHIP IN AVENING</title>
		<content>    The{RELIGION }of people living in  
 the block is almost exclusively {     
{CHRISTIAN}.Seventy-one percent of the 
 people interviewed said that they were
{ANGLICAN}and worshipped at the "Holy  
 Cross" Parish church of Avening, built
 in 1080. Of the remainder, most were  
{BAPTIST}and worship at the Baptist    
 Chapel in the High Street, built in   
 1805. However, the lay-preacher, the  
 only Chapel official living in        
 Avening, Mr Frank Smith, said that his
 congregation had shrunk in recent     
 years. When the Chapel was extended in
 1903 to provide a large schoolroom,   
 fifty children attended Sunday School.
 Today there are fewer than twenty     
 regular worshippers including a few   
 children. Seven percent said that they
 were atheist and seven percent Roman  
 Catholic. People living on the nearby 
 Municipal Estate preferred the Chapel.</content>
