     St. Peter's Church is a beautiful 
building mainly built of sandstone and 
ironstone which gives it a lovely warm 
glow. It is built in the normal cross  
shape but there is a separate tower    
which is very unusual.                 
     In the 14th century, the church   
was bought by John and Joan Pyel and   
inside are monuments to them both in   
alabaster panelled tombs with their    
effigies on the top,both are in the    
side chapel named after them. These    
monuments were once richly and lavishly
emblazoned with gold and flowers. It is
believed that they were desecrated by  
rebel Roundheads in the 17th century.  
     The church has a set of beautiful 
stained glass windows which give a ray 
of colour to the interior of the       
church.
