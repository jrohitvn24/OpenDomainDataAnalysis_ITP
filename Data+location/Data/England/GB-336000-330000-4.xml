		<title>04Draining Tetchill Moor</title>
		<content>  In the  17th. century, a  man  called
 Gosse noted that, prior to  enclosure,
 the  moor  was "a great waste of mosse
 and  morishe  ground  overflowed  with
 water and  overgrown  with  alders and
 underwoods of no value". He noted that
 a  spear  stuck  into it would find no
 bottom but, once enclosed, bits on the
 edge had  turned into good  meadow. He
 decided to  dig  a ditch to  drain and
 lease the land and  thus  improved 450
 out  of  730  acres  of land. A second
 phase  saw  French  prisoners  of  war
 building a conduit at Hordley  so that
 the Tetchill Brook could drain much of
 the remaining moor. Today drainage and
 land improvement continues  with local
 firms specialising  in construction of
 mole drain systems so that farmers can
 improve grassland. In some areas, such
 as Hordley wharf,conservationists wish
 to preserve the wetlands.             </content>
