		<title>09Commerce in N.E.Mynd Area</title>
		<content>  The limited needs of a sparsely pop- 
 ulated rural area have dictated the   
 growth of trade and industry.The      
 majority of commercial ventures are   
 centred around Leebotwood,the largest 
 of the three villages in this section.
 This is due mainly to the A49 trunk   
 road,once the old turnpike road,which 
 roughly divides the village into two. 
  A little way outside Leebotwood on   
 the A49,there is a 'Little Chef' Rest-
 aurant,which offers the passing motor-
 ist a 'Fast food' service.Next to this
 there is a garage with a well-stocked 
 shop.The shop sells various goods from
 car accessories to watches,clocks and 
 household sundries.The garage also has
 second-hand cars and caravans and the 
 owner now has a small garden centre   
 adjacent to the garage.
