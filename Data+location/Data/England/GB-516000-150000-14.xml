		<content>  Near the station there is the{Head   
{Office}of a construction company      
 called Biwater Shellabear.We saw Mr.  
 White,the chairman.He said that the   
 company built sewage works,reservoirs,
 water filtration plant and pipe lines.
 The main contracts have been carried  
 out in{Africa}and the Middle East.    
  The office was built in Dorking in { 
{1975}because it was near{Gatwick and  
{Heathrow Airport}and close to{London.}
  There are enlarged photographs of    
 their projects in the{Reception       
{Hall,}which is rather warm,but the    
 receptionist was efficient.Inside it  
 is modern with leather sofas and      
 electrically operated curtains.       
  It is{highly computerised}and a{Telex
{System}makes overseas                 
 comunications quick and easy.         
{ A hot drink vending machine}had      
 taken over from the tea lady.         </content>
