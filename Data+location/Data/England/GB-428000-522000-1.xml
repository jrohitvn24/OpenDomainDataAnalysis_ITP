		<title>01Introduction to the area.</title>
		<content> Our area contains within its          
 boundaries aspects of{industrial}and  
{urban development}both{ancient and    
{modern.                               
 Travelling from the site of Heworth a 
{medieval village}through{Aycliffe     
{Village},to the{new town of Newton    
 Aycliffe is like a journey through    
 time.                                 
 The industrial estate,on the site of a
 wartime munitions factory,is separated
 from the houses which were built to   
 accommodate its workers, by a disused 
 railway line,which once carried coal  
 from the collieries west of the town  
 to the east coast.                    
 The motorway and main line railway    
 which bisect our block from north to  
 south point the way to the future.    
 Our school,which was the first to be  
 built in the new town,is on the site  
 of the former Sugar Hill farm.        </content>
