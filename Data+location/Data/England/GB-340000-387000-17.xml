		<title>17GATEACRE - ONCE A VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> The area known as{Gateacre}has been   
 inhabited for a very long time.The    
 Domesday records make reference to the
 district of{Little Woolton}(Gateacre) 
 as{Ulvetune.}It is not certain how or 
 when the name Gateacre came into      
 being.                                
 We do know that the{Anglo Saxons}had a
 settlement at Camp Hill in Woolton.The
 name could possibly be derived from   
 the Middle English gate, meaning{"way"
 and the Anglo Saxon acre, meaning     
{"field".}Gateacre Brow,leading from   
 the village crossroads,would have been
 the "way" to the grazing ground higher
 up,"the acre".It is also thought that 
 the name came from the Anglo Saxon,   
{Gottesacker}or God's acre.            
 The village remained very isolated    
 until the end of the last century when
 Liverpool widened its boundary and we 
 became part of the city in 1913.      </content>
