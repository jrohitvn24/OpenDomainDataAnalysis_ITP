		<title>20INFORMATION SYSTEMS - PANTON</title>
		<content>  One of the biggest problems with     
 living in the heart of the countryside
 is the dissemination of information. A
 library visits {PANTON }once every two
 weeks and stops at three pr-arranged  
 places for a duration of ten minutes. 
 This is a useful service but too rigid
 and brief to be anything other than a 
 poor substitute for a permanent       
 amenity. To publicise any meeting or  
 event notices are put in the post     
 office at Barkwith and Wragby and even
 then it is very likely that people    
 will not see them. There is no central
 place of information for residents of 
{PANTON. }People have to rely very     
 heavily on word of mouth to be fully  
 acquainted with local events and      
 news.As a result there is very little 
 likelihood of the emergence of        
 pressure groups or protest for better 
 services or conditions in rural areas.</content>
