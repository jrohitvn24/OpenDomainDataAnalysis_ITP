		<title>08STANTON SHOP</title>
		<content>   The village shop at{                
{Stanton-upon-Hine-Heath}is the last   
 remaining village shop.There used to  
 be many others until the war but the  
 coming of the motor car has led to    
 their decline.The shop has been there 
 for 80 years. {                       
   The shopkeeper buys his goods       
 from cash-and-carry in Shrewsbury.The 
 Post Office is at the left side of the
 shop and is like a tiny box.Old people
 come to get their{pensions.}It is very
 important because the nearest shops   
 are in{Shawbury}.Some people have no  
 transport,so they would protest if it 
 closed.                               
   The shop is very {old-fashioned}with
{wooden beams,}an old stone-tiled      
 floor and wooden counter.The till is a
 drawer and customers are served by the
 shopkeeper himself.He also runs a mini
 van service.                          </content>
