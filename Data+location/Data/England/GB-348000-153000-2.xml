		<content> The Mendips are a range of hills      
 rising to about 350 metres.Earth      
 movements have led to four major domes
 which have since been eroded exposing 
 older rocks in their cores.The block  
 is part of the{Mendip Plateau},a      
 gently undulating area,mostly above   
 250 metres.It is cut by several       
 shallow valleys.                      
  {Carboniferous Limestone}underlies   
 much of the block.Many typical        
 limestone features are found in the   
 area,mainly as a result of chemical   
 weathering by water.                  
   Swallets,scars,depressions,frequ    
 ent rocky outcrops and the upper part 
 of Cheddar gorge are characteristic of
 the surface landscape.Spectacular     
 features are also found below ground  
 in the{cave systems}of the            
 block,notably Longwood Swallet and    
 Manor Farm swallet.                   </content>
