		<title>01WELCOME TO HIGHAM FERRERS</title>
		<content>In the landscape of the twelve square  
kilometre block we have been given to  
study there are three main places;     
Higham Ferrers, Chelveston, Caldecote  
and a large rural area.                
                                       
Higham Ferrers has a population of     
5000. It is a very historical place    
with the church, a market cross,       
medieval and 17th century houses.      
                                       
Chelveston is a small peaceful village 
near Higham Ferrers which has a        
population of 260.                     
                                       
Caldecote has a population of 40 and   
also has a small church. There is an   
old American air base near Caldecote.  
                                       
Most of the land around this area is   
used for farming and the main industry 
is the manufacture of footwear.        </content>
