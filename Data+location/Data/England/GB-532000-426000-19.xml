		<title>19HOME AND SCHOOL,WITHERNSEA</title>
		<content>  My name is Nicholas Long.I am 10     
 years old and live in Withernsea. I   
 have a sister,Debbie, who will be 6 in
 August.My mother has just started a   
 new job at Barclay's Bank in Hull     
 while my father works on the docks as 
 a customs officer. I go to Withernsea 
 Junior School which is just down the  
 road from my house. I can walk to     
 school, but other children cycle or   
 have to get a bus. The Junior School  
 was once part of the senior school,   
 and the old junior school is now only 
 used for the infants aged from 4 to 7.
 There are 360 junior children in 13   
 classes and also a support unit to    
 help children in Mathematics and      
 English. School starts at 8.55 a.m.   
 and finishes at 3.30 p.m. for lunch. I
 enjoy school and  like living in      
 Withernsea, although it does get a bit
 crowded in the summer.                </content>
