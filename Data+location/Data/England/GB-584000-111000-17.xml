		<content> The coastline at Fairlight, East      
 Sussex suffers from erosion caused by 
 weather-action on the soft sandstone  
 clifftops.   Bits of the sandstone    
 cliff crumble away slowly, or         
 occasionally, collapse in large chunks
 onto the shingle beach or into the sea
                                       
 The rate of erosion is approximately  
 twelve inches each year, and occurs in
 Hastings Country Park and further east
 at Fairlight.   The Country Park is   
 gradually losing land to the sea, and 
 if the erosion continues at the same  
 spots, eventually a few of the        
 bungalows at Fairlight may be         
 threatened.                           
                                       
 Part of the beach affected by erosion 
 was designated a naturist beach a few 
 years ago as it is away from the main 
 tourist beaches.                      </content>
