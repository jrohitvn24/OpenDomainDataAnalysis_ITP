		<content>Primary education is provided in this  
area for children between the ages of  
5 and 11. The LEA policy is to admit   
children during the school year in     
which they are 5, either in September  
or January,depending on their birthday.
Extra resources have been provided at  
a few schools enabling all the children
to be admitted in the Autumn term.     
Parents may choose which school they   
want for their children,providing that 
places are available.Each school has an
admissions policy outlining priorities 
when allocating places.Admission to    
county or controlled schools is the    
responsibility of the LEA but in Aided 
schools this rests with the Governing  
Body.At 11 children from R.C.schools   
are expected to transfer to Our Lady's 
High School.Otherwise all children take
a selection test for a place at Grammar
school or Secondary Modern school.     </content>
