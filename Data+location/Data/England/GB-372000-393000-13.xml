		<content> I get up at eight-fifteen, put my     
 uniform on and go to school at        
 eight forty-five. When I get to       
 school I have the register and then do
 some work. After assembly we go out to
 play. After maths I have my dinner    
 then play until ten minutes past one. 
 We read silently and then its         
 playtime. I work for about fifty      
 minutes and then go home.             
  When I get home I change my clothes. 
 I pretend that my friend is in the    
 mirror and I talk to her. I take my   
 dog for a walk and do my spelling and 
 sums. When I go out to play I make    
 tents and dens and bomb them in. At   
 five o'clock I go in for tea, like    
 chicken pie, chips and peas with ice  
 cream. After tea I take my dog and    
 play with my friend again. I speak to 
 my Mum on the phone and practise my   
 cornet before I go to bed.            </content>
