		<title>19THE HAMLET OF TUNLEY.</title>
		<content> Tunley is a very small hamlet and has 
 only{eight houses.}All of which are   
 over 200 years old.There are{no       
{shops,telephone boxes or bus services 
 and only narrow lanes. Tunley is very 
 quiet but that is why people like     
 living there and they all travel 4    
 miles to the nearest shop and 7 miles 
 to a supermarket.                     
  All the inhabitants have{telephones  
 and at least one{car,}but while a     
 telephone is considered vital everyone
 believes they could be happy without a
 car.                                  
  They all enjoy{the beautiful scenery 
 and the wide variety of{wildlife}and  
 of course the{peace}and{quiet.}The    
 disadvantages are the distances to    
 schools and the noise of aircraft from
 the USAF at Fairford and car horns in 
 the lane.                             
                                       </content>
