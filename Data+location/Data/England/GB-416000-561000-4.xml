		<title>04A DAY AT BLAYDON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> On Mondays I get up at 7.30am and have
 my breakfast. Then I put on my        
 uniform and go for the school bus. I  
 arrive just before 8.50am when the    
 bell goes. We go to our registration  
 classes until 9.15am. My first lesson 
 is Chemistry. All lessons last 70     
 mins.The morning break lasts 15mins   
 and then it is Woodwork. We are making
 wooden animals. Dinner is from 11.50am
 to 1.00pm. We have to go home because 
 of the teacher's action over their pay
 claim. Our next lesson is Physical    
 Education during which we do          
 athletics. Afternoon break is from    
 2.10pm to 2.20pm, and then we get     
 History. In this lesson we are writing
 our contributions for the Domesday    
 Project. School ends at 3.30pm. I go  
 home on the school bus which leaves   
 from the school gates.
