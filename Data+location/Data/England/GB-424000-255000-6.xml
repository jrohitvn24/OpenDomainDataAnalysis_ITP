   The National Vegetable Research     
Station was moved to Wellesbourne in   
1949.The site covers 1.9 sq.km.and     
until a few years ago employed over    
two hundred people. Government cuts    
have recently reduced this number      
dramatically.    The work at the       
Station is under the control of the    
Ministry of Agriculture who also       
provide most of the finance.           
Aspects of the work include Plant      
Breeding,Plant Physiology,Gene Bank,   
Plant Pathology,Soil Science,Pest      
Control,and Bio-Chemistry.There is a   
large area of glasshouses, which are   
under automatic control, as well as a  
farm which is operated for profit.     
Extensive use is made of computers.
