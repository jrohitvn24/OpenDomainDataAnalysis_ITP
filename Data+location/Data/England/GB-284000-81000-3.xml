		<title>03Trusham Village -2-</title>
		<content> There is no industry as such in the   
 village, but many villagers work in   
 the local quarry and precast concrete 
 works. Others commute to Exeter,      
 Chudleigh, and Newton Abbot daily.    
 Some new private houses have recently 
 been built and these vary in price    
 from forty to eighty thousand pounds  
 with no natural gas service.  Many    
 sporting and social activities are    
 linked to other villages in the Teign 
 Valley.  For example Trusham supported
 the fund raising for the resurfacing  
 of the tennis courts at Christow.  A  
 mobile library visits the village once
 a week, and a mobile playgroup visits 
 during the summer. For young people   
 there is little social life, and they 
 therefore tend to go to Chudleigh,    
 Torquay or Exeter for entertainment.  
 There is a bus to Newton Abbot every  
 Wednesday at 10am.(Don't miss it!).   </content>
