		<content>  In{1864,}when our school was built,it
 only had one classroom though there   
 were more children then.{Today}there  
 are{34;then}there were{58.}The infants
 and juniors used to be separated by a 
 screen.The teacher,Miss Grainger,lived
 in the schoolhouse and there was a    
 door going from the classroom to her  
 house.Mrs.Williams,the caretaker,lives
 there now.We work in two new class-   
 rooms,built on the playground a few   
 years ago.Miss Watson teaches the in- 
 fants,Mrs.Dunning teaches the juniors.
 In September Mrs.Rochelle will be the 
 new head.Our dinners come by ambulance
 from Ford school.We eat them in the   
 Victory Hall across the yard. Mrs.    
 Whittle looks after us at dinner time.
 We go to Wattlesborough for games on  
 Friday afternoon.Our Mums take us by  
 car.When we leave this school we go to
 Mary Webb school,Pontesbury.          </content>
