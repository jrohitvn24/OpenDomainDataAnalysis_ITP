		<title>17FARMING NEAR TOW LAW 1/2</title>
		<content> The farms in this area are about 250  
 acres in size. Some of the land is    
 used for crops but because of the     
 climate and the poor soil most of it  
 is used to graze cattle and sheep.    
 Some fields are used to make hay in   
 preparation for Winter.               
                                       
 There are about 4 or 5 workers on each
 farm and they work 10 hours a day.    
 The busiest times of the year are     
 Spring and Summer. In Spring the men  
 are busy with lambing and calving; in 
 Summer with hay-making .              
                                       
 Winters can be harsh so the animals   
 are always kept in the fields nearest 
 the farm-buildings or in the byres at 
 this time.                            
                                       
 The local cattle-mart in Tow Law is an
 event not to be missed.               </content>
