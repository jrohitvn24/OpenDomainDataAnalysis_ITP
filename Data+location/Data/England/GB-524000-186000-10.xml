		<title>10INTERNATIONAL EVENING</title>
		<content> Amita writes:{'An International       
{Evening'}at my school is when all the 
 parents come together and have a good 
 time.They sit together at small tables
 and talk, watch the entertainment and 
 eat. Parents wear their own{national} 
{costumes}from many countries. My      
 mother wore her saree. There are foods
 of all kinds, sweet, savoury, hot and 
 juicy and people have brought their   
 own dishes of food which is usually a 
 recipe from their own country. No     
 children can go unless they are part  
 of the entertainment. This year I was 
 part of that when I sang in the choir.
 We had to learn six songs in one day  
 because some children could not come  
 after all. We enjoyed the evenig      
 though and were glad to be picked.    
 Greek and Indian dancers were also    
 performing and we could watch them.   
 Parents look forward to this event.   </content>
