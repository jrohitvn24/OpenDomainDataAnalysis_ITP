		<content>CHANGING FACE OF MEDWAY JOBS           
                                       
Mr. Dickman's first job was coffin     
making. Horse drawn wagons were still  
in use. His father and maternal        
grandfather were in the Royal Marines. 
His father was sent to Chatham at the  
outbreak of the 2nd World War. Mr.     
Dickman joined the dockyard in 1955 as 
an apprentice engineer. He worked      
there for 27 years. He was made        
redundant at the age of 45 with a wife 
and 2 children to support. Most of his 
fellow workers found other jobs        
locally. Mr. Dickman has been a school 
caretaker for 2 years. He is shortly   
returning to machine-engineering but   
working with aircraft not ships. He is 
joining an aircraft firm whose         
business is expanding. We wish him     
well!
