		<title>12ICKNIELD WALK SCHOOL FETE</title>
		<content> Every Summer in June our school       
 has a fete.There are stalls and games 
 to play,and rides to have on our      
 school field and playground.There was 
 a {Sinclair C5}to ride in.It is       
 battery powered and the handle bars   
 are under your legs. There were other 
 rides  we could go on too,there was a 
{Chuffy Train}and a{tractor ride.}There
 was a game called {football accuracy} 
 where I had to kick a ball through    
 some tyres.The funniest game was the  
{Aunt Sally}where a teacher put his    
 head though a hole in a picture and   
 everyone paid to throw wet sponges at 
 him.Every one liked throwing them at  
 our headmaster.There was a{dog show   
 and we brought our pets along.There   
 was a{dancing display}around the      
 maypole and a{fancy-dress}parade,and  
 the theme was a person from 1066 to   
 1985.At the end was a {raffle draw.}  </content>
