{FORESTRY CONTINUED}                   
 The forestry commission have a large  
 nursery in the forest &amp; four to five  
 million plants are produced annually  
 for use in forestry commission forests
 all over Britain.Old Pale Nursery is  
 located in the south eastern part of  
 the forest,near the railway station.  
 The main production is of pine &amp;      
 spruce in polyhouses,about 300000     
 seedlings are produced each year for  
 planting in the drier sandier forests.
 500000 rooted cuttings are produced   
 from Old Pale's ten polyhouses each   
 year.                                 
 The animal life of the forest is      
 dependant on the vegetation.In the    
 more open areas the ferns dominate,   
 brackens &amp; broad buckler fern also.   
 There are bluebells,wood sorrell &amp;    
 creeping soft grass too.              </content>
