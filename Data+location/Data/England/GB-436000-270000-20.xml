		<title>20Living in Bubbenhall</title>
		<content> Population Bubbenhall village is a    
 small and                             
 quiet place.Most non_local traffic is 
 caused by customers to the 2 public   
 houses.A majority of the inhabitants  
 live in large modern detached         
 houses,major new housing developments 
 having taken place in the last 10/15  
 years.People buy goods from the only  
 local shop,but most of the shopping is
 done in nearby towns_Leamington       
 Spa,Warwick,Coventry_where most people
 tend to work.There is little work in  
 Bubbenhall , other than the 2 public  
 houses and farms.There is also a man  
 who sells groceries from his          
 van.Opposite "The Three Horseshoes" is
 a natural spring which is many        
 hundreds of years old.It emits cool   
 water even in the hottest,driest      
 summers.Many local people believe it  
 is better to drink than tap water.    </content>
