		<title>13TRAFFIC SURVEY IN WOOTTON</title>
		<content>  The major road in Wootton High       
 Street is used by both local and      
 through traffic . Traffic movement is 
 heaviest during the rush hours from 8 
 to 9 a.m. and from 5 to 6 p.m. and    
 at lunchtime, with people commuting to
 jobs in nearby Ryde and Newport.      
  Over a typical ten minute period 215 
 cars, 30 vans and lorries, 2 buses and
 a number of cycles passed our survey  
 point in both directions. Wootton lies
 on the main Newport to Ryde road and  
 3 bus services, 1A,1B,4C pass through 
 regularly.                            
  Wootton Bridge itself is a           
 potentially dangerous spot, being very
 narrow with no pavement. The access   
 road to the car ferry terminal has    
 also recently been widened and        
 improved to reduce summer congestion  
 at this point.                        
                                       </content>
