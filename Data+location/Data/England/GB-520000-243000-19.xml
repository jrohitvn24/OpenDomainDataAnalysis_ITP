		<title>19Sunderland Hall Farm.</title>
		<content>   This farm is about 260 acres in     
 size. The farmhouse is a listed       
 building and dates from Tudor times.  
 The farm was purchased 40 years ago.  
 The present owner is Mr Smith who is  
 a Governor of Stratton School.        
   Cereals and vegetables are grown on 
 the farm. The cereals are grown for   
 seed and chemicals are used to assist 
 growth.                               
   The soil on the farm is variable -  
 sands, gravels and clays. In the past 
 one field was used as a tip and it is 
 not uncommon for the farmer to plough 
 up rubbish.                           
   The farm employs 6 fulltime workers 
 and 2 part time men during harvesting.
   The farm has a small resevoir. Elm  
 trees on the farm were removed several
 years ago because of the Dutch Elm    
 Disease.
