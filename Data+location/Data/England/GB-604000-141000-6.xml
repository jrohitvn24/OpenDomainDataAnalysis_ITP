		<title>06HINXHILL ESTATE FARM 5</title>
		<content>At the farm there are many essential   
machines such as combine harvesters,   
potato elevators, muck spreaders and   
tractors.On each man driven machine a  
two wave radio enables communication   
thrughout the farm.8 years ago there   
were 3 dairies but now there is only   
1. There are bull pens but the govern- 
ment  have cut down on the size        
of the original herd.A profit must be  
made from the produce of the farm to   
buy the equipment needed, as well as   
to make the work economical.The        
average price of a combine harvester   
is between 20,000 and 60,000 pounds    
this is only 1 example of expense.     
There is 1 farm manager,1 mechanical   
fitter,6 arable workers,1 stock        
worker,1 maintainance   worker,        
a secretary and a gamekeeper.          
Hinxhill Estate Farm is run efficiently
and sets a high standard.              </content>
