		<title>07GLANFORD HOSPITAL, BRIGG</title>
		<content> Glanford Hospital is a small country  
 hospital in Brigg.  It has a small    
 casualty for minor injuries, a small  
 out-patient clinic and four wards with
 fifty-one patients in them.  Some     
 patients are in for a short stay and  
 others are kept in for a long time as 
 they are unable to look after         
 themselves.  The patients are all over
 the age of sixty-five.                
                                       
 It has got a small kitchen which      
 serves the patients meals three times 
 a day.  It has also got a small       
 physiotherapy and occupational therapy
 unit which helps the patients and aids
 their recovery.  Sometimes the long   
 term patients are taken out for rides 
 to Cleethorpes and surrounding        
 villages and they enjoy this very much
 indeed.
