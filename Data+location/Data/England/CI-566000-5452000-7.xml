		<title>07St. Martin's Village Shops</title>
		<content>   In the area around St. Martin's     
 church, the main amenities are two    
 shops, {General Stores}and{Crown      
{Stores.} Both are basically grocery   
 shops, selling fresh food, tinned and 
 packaged goods and frozen foods. Goods
 are usually delivered once a week.    
 Locally grown fruit and vegetables are
 delivered daily. The shops are open   
 for ten hours a day, and              
 holiday-makers as well as local people
 shop here in the summer.  Both shops  
 stock a wide range of provisions and  
 special goods such as books,          
 postcards, plugs, barbecue charcoal,  
 newspapers, stamps, wines and         
 spirits.They also have a small        
 delicatessen.  Because the shops are  
 isolated they provide services such as
 local advertising, taxi and car hire, 
 and are agents for dry cleaning.
