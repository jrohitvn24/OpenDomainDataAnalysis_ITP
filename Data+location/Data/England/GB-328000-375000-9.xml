 On 19th June "85" we went to Ness     
 Gardens to interview Mr Cunnington.   
     He said that the garden had been  
 started in 1898 by a man called Arthur
 Kilpin Bulley who owned the sixty     
 acres of land then. Now the University
 of Liverpool owns the gardens and it's
 used by the University for the        
 teaching of students. The students are
 geneticists, botanists, geographers,  
 biochemists and zoologists. Also it is
 open to the public all week.          
     The staff of the gardens are paid 
 but the Friends of Ness Gardens are   
 voluntary workers.                    
      Each of the Friends of Ness      
 Gardens has his or her own patch of   
 garden and they look after that       
 particular patch with pride.Staffing  
 consists of 10 permanent,4 part time,2
