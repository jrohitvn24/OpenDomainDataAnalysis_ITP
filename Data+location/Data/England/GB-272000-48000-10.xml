		<content> There are two parish churches in the  
 survey area, Loddiswell with its      
 church St. Michael and All Angels, and
 Woodleigh with St. Mary's. They are   
 both ancient buildings built of the   
 local stone but with some granite from
 Dartmoor in the structure.            
 Congregations tend to be rather small 
 and the vicar also tends two other    
 churches, at Moreleigh and Halwell.   
 However there is a rota so that each  
 of the four churches has a service    
 each Sunday, either Holy Communion,   
 a Family Service or Evening Prayer.   
                                       
 In Loddiswell there is a large and    
 quite well attended Congregational    
 Church or Chapel, built in the middle 
 of the 19th century. There are two    
 services each Sunday, at 11am and     
 6.30pm.
