		<title>01COTSWOLDS REVIEW</title>
		<content> The area which we have studied        
 consists                              
 of Andoversford,Syreford,Sevenhampton 
 and Whittington,four Cotswold         
 villages.These were small villages    
 originally occupied by farm           
 workers.The villages were mainly built
 of local Cotswold stone with a        
 school,a village hall and a large     
 manor house where the main landowner  
 once lived.The main employment of the 
 area is farming.Today,most of the     
 local shops and schools have closed   
 and as a result of modern farming     
 methods,very few people work on       
 farms.This means that for most        
 people,work,essential shopping and    
 education after 11 years is in        
 Cheltenham.
