		<content> I usually{wake up}at about 8.OO or    
 8.l5. I get woken up by Mum or my     
 brother. For{breakfast}I have         
 cereal,toast, and a drink of milk. I  
 quickly rush to the bathroom before my
 brother gets in there.I  have a wash  
 and clean my teeth. I say goodbye to  
 my Mum and{walk to School.}When the   
 final bell goes we all rush out of    
 school eager to get home. I either go 
 to my friend's house to stay for{tea }
 or just to play, or she comes to my   
 house,or my friends and I might play  
 in the park. At 5.OO I come in for my 
{tea,}and after tea I sometimes play on
 my brothers{computer.}At 7.OO I watch 
{television}and at 9.OO I have a wash  
 and clean my teeth. Then I write my   
{diary,}wind my clock up and go        
 to sleep. I go to sleep dreaming of   
 what tomorrow will  bring!
