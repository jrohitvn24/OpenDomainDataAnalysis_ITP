		<content> The clothes that people wear for work 
 depends on the type of work they do.  
 Many people in the area do manual work
 where jeans,jumpers and other casual  
 clothes are worn.Men who work in      
 offices,or as salesmen,wear smart     
 suits.A lot of people wear casual     
 clothes for leisure too : jeans,      
 sweatshirts,t-shirts. For special     
 occasions, men almost all wear a suit,
 and women wear a suit or a dress.Most 
 people spend about Â£150_Â£250 in a year
 on clothes. When people have finished 
 with their clothes they usually give  
 them to a local jumble sale.A few     
 people put them in a "rag-bag" and a  
 few simply put them in the bin. It is 
 common for people to  make a special  
 trip to Bristol's department stores to
 buy clothes. However, not many people 
 regard it as important to keep up     
 with the latest fashions.             </content>
