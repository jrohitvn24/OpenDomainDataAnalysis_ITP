		<content>       To make glass in the eighteenth 
 century the following materials would 
 be required:                          
      {1.Sand}An abundant supply of    
 sand, the more pure the sand, the     
 whiter the glass.{2.Coal}You need a   
 lot of coal to heat the furnace to    
 melt the sand into molten material.{  
{3.Salt}This was obtained from heating 
 and evaporating seawater in large     
 pans.{4.Seaweed}(Kelp) This was used  
 as a "flux" to help mix the salt and  
 sand in the furnace.{5.Clay}The clay  
 was used to make pot furnaces. Each   
 pot had to be renewed every few       
 months.{6.Firebricks}Firebricks were  
 hard, heat resistant stone which      
 encased each pot furnace.{7.Fresh     
{water}A plentiful supply was needed   
 for wetting the clay and cooling      
 equipment.                            
                                       </content>
