		<title>18Memories of Wakefield</title>
		<content> Fifty years ago,girls attending the{  
{Girl's High School}wore similar       
 uniforms as today i.e.skirts,blouses  
 and dresses.For P.E.however they wore 
 luminous shorts .For entertainment in 
 Wakefield 50 years ago children could 
 go to the pictures or theatre which   
 were far more popular then.Many       
 teenagers joined youth clubs .At home 
 people would listen to the radio which
 was called the wireless.The Second    
 World War did not affect the children 
 of Wakefield very much,as it was the  
 nearby City of Sheffield which took   
 most of the German bombs.People did   
 have to get used to using coupons for 
 clothes,sweets and food.All children  
 had to carry gas masks but they were  
 never used.Public transport in        
 Wakefield was said to be better forty 
 years ago than it is now,at least     
 buses came on time,every ten minutes. </content>
