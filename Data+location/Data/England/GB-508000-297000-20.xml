		<content>  Ailsworth is a well established      
 village with a long history. One      
 family, still resident in the village,
 has lived there since it was granted  
 one and a half acres of land five     
 hundred years age.                    
  The village has its own shops, pubs  
 and a methodist chapel and a mobile   
 library which visits weekly. Many     
 other village services and amenities  
 are available in the adjoining village
 of Castor. These include police,      
 primary school, church and more shops 
 and pubs.                             
  The village has a lively community   
 which provides many events, services  
 and amentites for the local people.   
 These include a playgroup and a team  
 of volunteers who welcome new families
 to the village, help families where   
 someone is ill and provide assistance 
 to older residents.                   </content>
