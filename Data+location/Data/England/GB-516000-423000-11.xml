		<content> St Andrews church was built in the    
 fouteenth century,the first vicar was 
 the Rev Cordeux who wished to be      
 burried as close to the church as     
 possible.The original church was built
 in 1295 on one acre of ground close to
 the river but that fell into decay and
 the present church was built as it is 
 now in open fields a quarter of a mile
 from the village of Paull.            
  We carried out a cencu and found out 
 that most of the village population is
 Church of England although we could   
 not tell exactly as there were not    
 many people who bothered to fill in   
 the census forms.We found out that    
 there are ten Mormons in our area,    
 three Jehovahs Witnesses,eight        
 Anglican Catholics,six Roman          
 Catholics,twelve Methodists,and five  
 people said that they were agnostics.
