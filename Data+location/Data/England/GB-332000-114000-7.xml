		<title>07VILLAGE HALL, BROADWAY</title>
		<content>                                       
 The village hall,which is being slowly
 assembled will be a new hall for      
 Broadway. The project was started in  
 January 1985.                         
         We raised money by having     
 fete's, car boot sales, coffee        
 mornings, and an antique roadshow.The 
 hall is to the north-east of the      
 village .                             
         There are several different   
 building materials used for our       
 village hall.The sand and bradstone   
 are already there and we have concrete
 blocks for the walls.The steel girders
 are already up and gravel is on the   
 floor prior to concreting.            
         The hall will have a big room 
 for football,table tennis,discos,and  
 meetings.There will also be a youth   
 club and possibly a scout troop.      
 It will be opened in 1986.            </content>
