		<content> Wooler provides services for a wide-  
 spread rural community.There is a Fire
 Station but the firemen all do other  
 jobs as well as manning the fire      
 engines.There is a new Ambulance Stat-
 ion, but they have to be called out   
 from Newcastle.There is quite a large 
 Police Station but not many policemen 
 to occupy it.                         
    The town has two doctors' surgeries
 and a clinic. There is also a dentist 
 who comes to the clinic and a physiot-
 herapist.Wooler also has two chiropod-
 ists.The nearest hospitals are at Aln-
 wick and Berwick.                     
    There is a Library and a Community 
 Centre.The Archbold Hall is used for  
 other community events as is Glendale 
 School.
