		<title>12EVENTS 2 BISHOP THORNTON</title>
		<content> Here are the words for one of the     
 songs the children made up for the    
 Medieval Masque.                      
 In the year of 1460 long ago          
 Bishop Thornton was a lonely place    
 Four times a year just to please the  
 king, People walked 8 miles to church 
 for holy days, They would rather stay 
 at home and dig thier fields, Time was
 scarce and crops must be tilled,Starve
 they must if they don't make a store, 
 Winters long and cold and does not    
 pity them. Forester Wallworth made a  
 pledge to build a church, Bridle paths
 from every side will meet. Sorry to   
 say more taxes you will pay, In a     
 village of thorns a church was born so
 long ago. There was great rejoicing   
 when the church was finished every    
 stone, John and Margaret met and fell 
 in love, Permission was sought for the
 wedding to take place.............    </content>
