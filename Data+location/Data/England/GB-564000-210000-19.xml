   Today there are no schools open in  
the area.                              
   In 1807 there was "Dame's School"   
for 8 to 10 young children and run by  
one lady. The children paid a few pence
a week for their education.            
   In 1839 in Chignal St. James there  
was a daily school for 46 children     
both sexes. There was also Sunday      
school for 72 children. All these were 
fee paying schools.
