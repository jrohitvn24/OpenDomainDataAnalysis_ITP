		<content>      The Civic Society is interested  
 in plants and making the country      
 beautiful. They plant bulbs and trees 
 around the place.                     
      In the trim neat gardens around  
 the area people grow plants such as   
 daffodils and roses around their      
 borders.                              
      There are now less wild flowers  
 in the fields because of drainage and 
 use of herbicides.                    
      Tree preservation orders are     
 being lifted because no one dared to  
 cut down any trees and so woods were  
 getting neglected. Instead, advice is 
 now being given to help thin woodland.
      The{sundew}is one rare plant     
 which can be seen on the Long Mynd. It
 has spikes round its leaves and snaps 
 up insects. Whinberries grow          
 abundantly on the bracken covered     
 hillsides.                            </content>
