		<content>{EDUCATION}There are Primary schools at
 Guilden Sutton (180 pupils) and Great 
 Barrow (30 pupils), both maintain a   
 close relationship with parents who   
 help in school with cookery, arts and 
 craft, fund raising etc. The          
 communities support the school as it  
 is central to a living village.       
{RELIGION}There are Anglican churches  
 at Great Barrow and Guilden Sutton    
 both with incumbents. There is a      
 Methodist Chapel in the latter served 
 by circuit Preachers. There are active
 groups attached to all Churches       
 including Sunday School and Prayer    
 meetings.                             
{LAW &amp; ORDER}Because it is a rural area
 a community Policeman serves several  
 villages. There is a cross section of 
 crime but the levels are not          
 considered high.
