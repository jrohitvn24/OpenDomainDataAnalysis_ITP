		<title>01An introduction to our area.</title>
		<content>  This is a rural area just outside    
 Gainsborough. It includes three       
 villages,Heapham,Springthorpe and part
 of Upton.Farming covers most of the   
 land much of which belongs to Thonock 
 Estates and the Bacon family who live 
 in Norfolk.There are some areas of    
 comercial deciduous woodland but most 
 of the land is used for growing crops 
 and grass. The main soil type is      
 clay. With  slightly rolling          
 countryside. The farms do not employ  
 many people now so most have to work  
 in Gainsborough. There are few        
 children living in the area and the   
 local village school in Springthorpe  
 closed in the summer of 1948.There is 
 a small airport at Sturgate which was 
 once used by the American Airforce    
 during the second world war.There are 
 two churches and one methodist chapel.
