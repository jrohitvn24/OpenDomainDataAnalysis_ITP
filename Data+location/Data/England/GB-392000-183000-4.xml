		<content> We interviewed the vicar,{Rev.Oswald, 
 about the history of the church.It    
 used to be a chapel attached to       
 Malmesbury Abbey,which at the time of 
 the{Domesday Book}owned the village of
 Corston.Very little of the old        
 building remains-the church was almost
 entirely rebuilt in the nineteenth    
 century.{The south doorway}dates from 
 the fifteenth century,and the rood    
 screen is also old.This has a lovely  
 pattern of a vine covered in gilt     
 along the top of it.{The pulpit}was   
 made in the seventeenth century,and   
 looks very solid.The oldest memorial  
 in the church is to{Buck Gale,}who    
 died in 1726 at the age of 81,who     
 "lived on earth as a true disciple of 
 christ,in humility,in wisdom,in       
 goodness and in charity."
