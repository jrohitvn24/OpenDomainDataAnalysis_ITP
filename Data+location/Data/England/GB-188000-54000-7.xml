		<title>07TRAFFIC IN SUMMERCOURT</title>
		<content> As in most parts of Cornwall the      
 summer influx of visitors presents a  
 problem.This certainly happens along  
 the main A30 trunk road which runs    
 through Summercourt but throughout the
 year traffic through the village is   
 heavy and increasing in volume and    
 size of vehicle year by year.         
    The problem in the centre of       
 Summercourt is the road crossing-the  
 main Newquay to St Austell road across
 the A30.To overcome the difficulties, 
 traffic lights were installed years   
 ago but in summer these only aggravate
 a problem of volume along the main    
 road.                                 
 Discussions have been in progress     
 trying to establish a route to by pass
 the village but as in all such cases  
 too many people have individual       
 interests.It is planned to build a by 
 pass to the North of the village.     </content>
