		<content> Stapleton Farm is a 230 acres dairy   
 farm.  It is mainly grassland, with   
 the rest arable, shared moorland of 25
 acres and 25 acres of fenced deciduous
 woodland.  There are three members of 
 the family running the farm.  Attached
 to the farm is a yoghurt producing    
 plant run by three family members and 
 six employees.  It was started in 1975
 as a cottage industry using one churn 
 of milk per day and now uses 1000     
 litres daily.  Two thirds comes from  
 Stapleton Farm, the rest from the Milk
 Marketing Board. As well as the       
 yoghurt 600 lbs. of cream are produced
 each week. These products are sold    
 throughout Devon and in places as far 
 away as Bristol and London.
