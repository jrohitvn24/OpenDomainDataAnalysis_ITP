		<title>04THE OTMOOR RIOTS</title>
		<content>In the early 1800's villagers grazed   
their animals on Otmoor.However,later  
on,certain landowners thought that if  
Otmoor was enclosed and drained it     
would make valuable plough land.In     
1815 Otmoor was enclosed and drained   
by altering the course of the River    
Ray.The villagers were so annoyed,they 
rioted onto Otmoor pulling down hedges 
and throwing them into the ditches.The 
troops were called in and 44 rioters   
were arrested.They were taken to       
Oxford on St Giles Day,which was       
crowded  with country folk enjoying    
the annual fair.The prisoners raised   
the cry "Otmoor for Ever!".The crowd   
followed their example and attacked the
troops with bricks and stones.The      
troops were overpowed and all 44       
prisoners escaped.The landowners won   
their battle in the end,but the River  
Ray flooded and Otmoor didn't dry out. </content>
