 Knutsford is a Cheshire Market Town,  
 population 14,000. The town is        
 surrounded by rich farmland and is    
 bordered to the north by Tatton Park. 
 It is close to the M6, and is on the  
 Chester - Manchester railway line and 
 close to Manchester Airport. Many of  
 Knutsford's residents are commuters   
 but it is also a centre for people who
 work in local industries, including   
 Banking, Chemicals, Computers, Nuclear
 Energy Planning and Holidays.         
   There are several primary schools,  
 and one large comprehensive school.   
 The town is a historic place and a    
 centre of tourism. Architecture is    
 unique, and the town centre remains   
 unspoiled. There are many good        
 restaurants and leisure facilities,   
 not the least of which is the         
 magnificent Tatton Park.              </content>
