		<content> A gently rolling countryside,the rich 
 dark soil rising in places to 230m,   
 with a mild damp climate,it is ideal  
 for producing lush grass to feed      
 Fresian cattle, both beef and milk,and
 sheep for meat and wool. The land is  
 divided by stone walls,narrow         
 roads,ancient green lanes sunk below  
 high hedges,many small streams and    
 natural springs. 7km from the sea,10km
 from Dartmoor and 400km from London   
 with a motorway link at Exeter and    
 train service at Totnes the outside   
 world impinges little here, being felt
 mainly in the increasing traffic      
 through the two small villages.  Some 
 260 inhabitants residing mainly along 
 the main roads live largely from      
 agriculture and its spinoffs,but the  
 influx of retirees and rise in        
 commuting increasingly counteracts    
 this.                                 </content>
