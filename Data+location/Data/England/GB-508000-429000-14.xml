		<title>14RAILWAY EMBANKMENT : HULL</title>
		<content>      The track on many sections of the
 old Hull and Barnsley line were       
 removed many years ago but the        
 embankment now provides a home for    
 many animals and plants.              
      On a walk near the old power     
 station down Sculcoates Lane, we found
 many young sycamore trees growing     
 here.   Bracket fungi had sprouted    
 here and there and a pile of chicken  
 bones and feathers suggested a family 
 of foxes lived nearby.   Many wild    
 plants including sorrel, yarrow,      
 rosebay, ragwort and red clover grow  
 in abundance.   Among them we found   
 red admiral butterflies, grasshoppers 
 and an array of other insects.        
 Overhead a kestrel hung, keeping a    
 sharp look-out for mice and voles.    
      Suddenly a young rabbit shot out 
 from its burrow, disturbing a flock of
 goldfinches feeding in the thistles.  </content>
