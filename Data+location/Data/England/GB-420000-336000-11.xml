		<title>11THE CHEESE FACTORY</title>
		<content>    The cheese factory in Longford was 
 the first cheese factory in England.  
    It was opened by Cornelius         
 Schermerhorn. He opened it on the 4th 
 of May 1870.                          
    The cheese was made at the bottom  
 of the building  and stored at the    
 top. At the end of the cheese factory 
 is a little room which was the office 
 that a man used to sit in while the   
 people were working.                  
    Abbots now own part of the factory 
 but they just store grain in it.      
    The factory closed down because of 
 competition from other countries.
