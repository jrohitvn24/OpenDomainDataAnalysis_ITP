		<title>17Holiday Homes- Severn Valley</title>
		<content>    There are 5 areas with caravans and
 Shack sites totalling some 283        
 dwellings, the majority of which are  
 for holiday use by their owners.      
 They were built just after the 2nd    
 world war before the existence of     
 planning regulations. A survey of the 
 sites was done in 1979.               
    There are a few caravans which     
 are inhabited for 8-10 months a       
 year, but mostly shacks which are     
 made of wood and asbestos with        
 bitumen felt roofs. Many have gardens 
 and trees around them and, as most are
 on hillsides, blend into their        
 surroundings well.                    
    Folly Point has 6 shacks, Severn   
 Meadow 52 shacks and 2 caravans,      
 Northwood Lane 10 shacks, Hill Farm   
 130 shacks and 7 caravans, Hawkbatch  
 Farm 45 shacks and 31 caravans. They  
 are used mostly by Midlanders.        </content>
