 Although this area is crossed by the  
 Southern Region railway from London to
 Leatherhead, Dorking and Worthing, it 
 does not have a station.              
                                       
 The stations of Ashtead just south of 
 the area, Leatherhead to the          
 south-west and Epsom to the east, all 
 provide good services for commuters to
 London. Much of the housing,          
 especially that in Epsom and Ashtead  
 to the South and East of the area, has
 been developed with the commuter in   
 mind and was built in the 1930's when 
 fast frequent services to London meant
 that people could live further out of 
 town in or near the country.
