		<content>One of the farms in Euxton, Toy Farm,  
is a Beef Cattle Farm. The bullocks are
brought in when quite young. The farmer
and his helpers feed them and give them
bedding. As the bullocks get older they
are let out to graze in some fields,   
but when they are nearlly fully grown  
bulls they are taken in before they go 
to the slaughter house to be killed for
beef.                                  
Many of the bullocks catch diseases    
which mmay also spread to humans.      
In Toy Farm there are some stables     
where horses are kept. The horses graze
in the field during the day and are    
taken inside at night.
