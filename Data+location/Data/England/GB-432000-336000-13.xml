		<content> Approximately 60% of the area is an   
 urban environment with the sorts of   
 habitat common to city areas: hedge-  
 rows &amp; semi-cultivated areas such as  
 grass verges &amp; school playing fields, 
 scattered trees usually planted singly
 or in small groups for landscaping,   
 wasteground, refuse tips the buildings
 themselves &amp; the parks. Markeaton Lake
 &amp; the River Derwent provide the major 
 aquatic habitats &amp; nesting sites for  
 waterfowl. The remaining 40% of the   
 area is farmland of many years stand- 
 ing, consequently there are no large  
 woodland areas and no apparent ancient
 woodland areas of any account. Hedge- 
 rows are predominantly hawthorn with  
 also elder, hazel and holly. The most 
 common trees are ash, sycamore, oak   
 &amp; beech. Lichen growth on tree trunks 
 would suggest a relatively high back- 
 ground level of air pollution.        </content>
