		<title>14Village Life in New Mill.</title>
		<content> In an age of rapid changes traditional
 village life still survives.New Mill  
 is a typical example of this.Many of  
 the community still work in the local 
 textile industry.Along side the mills 
 other villagers find employment with  
 the local shops, pubs and             
 garages.These villages are continually
 growing.They do not support the whole 
 work force.Many people commute daily  
 into Huddersfield for their work, but 
 are content to seek the peace of their
 homes in this quiet village.At a time 
 of decaying urban areas property in   
 these outlying villages is greatly    
 prized.It is not just the bright      
 lights of town where you can find     
 amusement.Village life is a full life 
 for those who want it to be.There are 
 activities for old and young.The      
 church,clubs and pubs provide sporting
 and social activities.                </content>
