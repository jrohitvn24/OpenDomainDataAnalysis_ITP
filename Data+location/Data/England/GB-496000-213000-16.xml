		<content>   Buses go in and out of the village  
 six days a week (not on Sundays).     
 Until 1985 the London and Country     
 Company ran the route, but then B. &amp;  
 B. of Potten End took over as a       
 private company. The bus times are few
 and not very convenient for shopping  
 in the local towns. The cost for a    
 return journey of 12 miles is Â£1.90.  
   The roads are bad and many of them  
 have pot holes, which can cause nasty 
 accidents especially when somebody is 
 riding a bike and a lorry is driving  
 fast behind the cyclist.              
   Cars are used for driving around the
 area.  Most have radios fitted and    
 some Citizens Band.  There are a lot  
 of people who have motor bikes and    
 pedal bikes.  The area is noted for   
 stables and many people own or hire   
 horses or ponies to ride on the bridle
 paths through the woods.              </content>
