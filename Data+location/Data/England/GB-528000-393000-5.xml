		<content> In 1985 there are a lot of cars, vans 
 and lorries about.There are 31 people 
 in our class and they own 46 cars     
 altogether. If you were on a motorway 
 you would see cars, vans, lorries and 
 motorbikes. My family has one car and 
 four bikes. Most people in our village
 have got bikes and everybody in our   
 class has too.Mrs.Cowlrick has a bike 
 too. Cars cost about Â£5000, lorries   
 cost about Â£15000, vans cost about    
 Â£3000 and motorbikes cost about Â£800  
 and they are going up in price all the
 time. Most people go abroad for their 
 holiday and to get abroad you can go  
 by ship, aeroplane or train. You don't
 normally go abroad by train because   
 you have to go across the sea. By
