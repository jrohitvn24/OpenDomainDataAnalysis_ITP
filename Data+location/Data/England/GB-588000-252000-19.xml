		<title>19CHANGING TIMES IN COCKFIELD</title>
		<content>Mr.George White,who is 82 years of age 
came to school to talk to us about life
in the village 40 years ago (1945).We  
asked what he remembered particularly  
about the year 1945 in this part of    
Cockfield.Of course he remembered that 
it was the end of the 2nd World War and
that the villagers held celebrations   
on Mr.Hodge's meadow.300 evacuees came 
by train to Cockfield from London as   
the Germans were bombing London at that
time.The evacuees were mostly children 
and mums.Everyone had to carry a gas-  
mask around in case poisonous gas bombs
were dropped.All the spare land was    
ploughed up and crops were planted on  
it,because ships full of food could not
get to England,as German submarines    
were torpedoing so many of them.When   
the milkman came round he used a half- 
pint measure.He showed us his identity 
card which he had carry in wartime.    </content>
