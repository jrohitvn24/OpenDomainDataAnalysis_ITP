Kinewell Lake got its name from a well 
which used to be in this field near the
river.It was used by cattle so kine the
old word for cattle was put with well  
to make Kinewell.                      
The older people in the village were   
sad when it was excavated because they 
had always been able to walk along a   
beautiful foot path to the river so the
company doing the work were asked if   
the village could have the lake.When it
was finished this was agreed.          
The lake is now a bird reserve with    
five islands and has been planted with 
over 1000 trees.Some fish got into the 
lake  when the river  flooded, but     
soon it will be properly stocked so    
that village people can go fishing.
