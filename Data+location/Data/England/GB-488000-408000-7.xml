		<title>07Lead Pollution in Scunthorpe</title>
		<content>  My dad works in the{Enviromental     
{Health Department.}In June 1982 six   
 Scunthorpe schools were tested for    
{lead pollution.}One of the six had a  
 high lead level in the dust in the    
 playground and that was{Ashby Junior  
{School,}the school which I go to.     
  The lead level was{6600 parts per    
{million}compared with Manchester at   
 970 ppm, Birmingham at 1200 ppm and   
 London at up to 1840 ppm.             
  Further dust samples were taken at   
 my school, which confirmed the        
 problem. The lead had come from{old   
{paint}which had flaked off and had    
 mixed with the dust.                  
  By hosing down the playground,       
 further readings were found to be no  
 higher than 1200 ppm.
