		<content> Situated to the north of Chester &amp; the
 west of Ellesmere Port,the area is    
 Permo Trias,low lying &amp; mantled with  
 boulder clay &amp; alluvium.It has less   
 than 40 inches of rain a year &amp; mild  
 sea air gives 7 frost free months per 
 year.It is mostly designated as Green 
 Belt &amp; is predominantly used for dairy
 farming.However,the western section,  
 bounded by the A41 &amp; A5117 will, with 
 the completion of estates near their  
 junction be almost totally covered by 
 housing.The Chester to Merseyside     
 railway bisects the area &amp; a newly    
 opened extension of the M56 motorway  
 starts in the south of the area       
 linking it to the nations system.The  
 most significant feature of the area  
 is the British Nuclear Fuels uranium  
 enrichment plant although its         
 distinctive cooling towers are being  
 demolished.                           </content>
