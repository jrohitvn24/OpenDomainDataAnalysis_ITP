		<content>        The school in Gipsey Bridge was
 set up about 150 years ago.It served  
 the population of Langrick, Gipsey    
 Bridge, and Wildmore.Before this time 
 the land was marsh and only a few     
 people lived here.At the moment there 
 are 27 children in the school and     
 there are two teachers although at one
 time there were more than 100 pupils  
 and a larger staff.The main school is 
 now used by the infants with one room 
 for the school hall while the juniors 
 are taught in a mobile classroom in   
 the school grounds. The school house  
 is now used as staffroom ,office and  
 store.                                
      The pupils enter this school at  
 the age of almost 5 and leave when    
 they are eleven at which time they go 
 to William Lovell Secondary Modern    
 School or to Horncastle Grammar       
 school.                               </content>
