		<content> Hatcliffe Top and Top Farm are owned  
 by the same owners. The present owners
 have lived at Top Farm for 15         
 years.the use of the land has changed 
 over the years from mainly grassland  
 and woodland to an arable and sheep   
 farm splet. The crops grown at the    
 farm are wheat, barley and also oil   
 seed rape. The owners keep 9 tups and 
 300 ewes. The owners need less labour 
 than in the years gone by but do      
 employ extra labour for harvest, sheep
 dipping and clipping and also roguing.
 They keep four horses and two ponies. 
 Hatcliffe Top is where all the lambs  
 and sheep are kept and at Hatcliffe   
 Top there are three gouses. The owners
 fear for the future is that they are  
 over producing cereals.
