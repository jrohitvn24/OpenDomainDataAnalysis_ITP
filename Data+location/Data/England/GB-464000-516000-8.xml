		<title>08SOCIAL CONCERNS - Lingdale.</title>
		<content>     {Lingdale}is a small village in   
 East Cleveland. It was formally a     
{mining community}dependant on the now 
 exhausted{iron-stone}mines. Most of   
 the{houses}are{terraced;}some are     
 empty. I think it would be a good{idea
 if these{houses}were{demolished}and   
{new ones built.                       
      There are very{few play-areas}in 
 Lingdale. I would demolish some of the
 old{empty shops}and build play-areas. 
 The{spoil-heaps}have been{levelled}and
 some{new houses}have been built,      
 together with a{new Primary school}and
{community centre.}The old school has  
 been converted to a{Youth Training    
{Centre.}I think there should be a new 
{shopping-centre}in Lingdale as well as
 a{comprehensive school}and{sports     
{centre.}If these were planned it would
 create more{jobs}for the area.
