		<content>      The village school closed in the 
 1960s and the children of Ringland had
 to come to school in Taverham.        
      The{Le Neve Trust,}founded in the
 18th century, was mostly spent on the 
 children of Ringland, the amount      
 depending on his attendance record and
 behaviour. Now that the local school  
 has been closed, the trust benefits   
 are spent on school uniforms and      
 outings for local children. There is a
 field in Ringland the rent from which 
 goes to the Le Neve Trust.            
     {Taverham High School}in Beech Ave
 occupies 11 acres of land which used  
 to be a turkey farm on the edge of the
 village. It opened in 1979 with room  
 for 500 pupils, but now with mobile   
 classrooms and extensions, it holds   
 700 mainly from Taverham and Horsford.
 There are 42 full time teachers. About
 230 pupils stay to school lunch (cont)</content>
