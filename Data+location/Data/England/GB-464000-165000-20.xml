		<title>20BURGHFIELD COM'N-CONCLUSION</title>
		<content> BURGHFIELD COMMON is a pleasant,rural,
 village in West Berkshire.We hope that
 this section of the Domesday Disc has 
 been helpful to the user,and that the 
 information provided illustrates life 
 in the village.In 1985,a large resid- 
 ential area was being built to meet   
 central government housing require-   
 ments.A major fear of villagers is    
 that this may harm the village's      
 appeal.                               
  Various groups have been involved in 
 collecting and processing the data for
 this section.These groups are....     
{ THE SIXTH FORM OF THE WILLINK SCHOOL,
{ 4TH YEAR PUPILS AT GARLAND COUNTY    
{ JUNIOR SCHOOL, }                     
{ PUPILS AT MRS BLANDS INFANT'S SCHOOL.
 All of these schools are in Burghfield
 Common.
