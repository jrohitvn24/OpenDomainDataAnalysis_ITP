		<title>07EMPLOYMENT IN MIDDLETON</title>
		<content> The cotton trade and silk-weaving were
 once major areas of employment in     
 Middleton. Now there are other, varied
 areas of employment.                  
 Middleton has a population of about   
 51,500. Numbers employed in primary   
 industry and construction have        
 declined in the last 30 years,        
 employing 0.15% &amp; 3% of the working   
 population respectively.              
 Middleton suffered badly in the       
 recession of the '20s &amp; '30s and in   
 the last 30 years unemployment has    
 risen again from 661 t0 4,155.        
 The biggest changes are seen in       
 textiles decreasing from the employ-  
 ment of over half the working         
 population in 1951, to a present-day  
 3%. Areas of growth are the clothing  
 industry, from 2% in 1971 to 6.5% in  
 1981, and the distribution industry   
 from 4.4% in 1951 to 11% in 1977.     </content>
