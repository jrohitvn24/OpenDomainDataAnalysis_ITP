		<title>09CONSTANTINE FARMING 1</title>
		<content>  TYPES OF FARMING;many of the farms in
 the area are small in comparision to  
 those in other parts of the country.  
 Herds of milking cows,notably Fresians
 are common,since they bring in a      
 steady income.Mixed crops are grown   
 especially potatoes,broccoli and      
 cabbages.Most farms have fertilised   
 grass land used for making silage for 
 Winter cattle food.Some farmers also  
 keep pigs which are fed on surplus    
 milk.Battery hens and calves are found
 on some farms.                        
 HORTICULTURE.There are a number of    
 small holdings and allotments n the   
 area which supply vegetables and      
 flowers to the village and local      
 markets.Early strawberries are grown  
 in fields near Trengilly Wartha.There 
 is a garden centre at Highcross which 
 supplies many types of plants         
 especially Azelias,which grow well.   </content>
