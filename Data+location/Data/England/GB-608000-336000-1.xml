		<content>{HOLT}IS A SMALL MARKET TOWN JUST A FEW
 MILES FROM THE NORTH NORFOLK COAST.   
 MOST OF THE TOWN WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE
 IN{1708}AND FINE GEORGIAN BUILDINGS   
 REPLACED THE EARLIER TUDOR HOUSES.    
 SMALL STREETS AND ALLEYWAYS, FILLED   
 WITH QUAINT FLINT COTTAGES, LEAD OFF  
 THE HIGH STREET. THERE ARE MANY SHOPS 
 SELLING GIFTS AND ANTIQUES. SOME OF   
 THE LOCAL ARTS AND CRAFTS ARE WELL    
 REPRESENTED. THE SURROUNDING          
 COUNTRYSIDE IS WILD AND BEAUTIFUL. A  
 FINE{COUNTRY PARK}IS A GOOD PLACE TO  
 TAKE A LEISURELY STROLL, AND THERE ARE
 SEVERAL INTRESTING HISTORIC HOMES TO  
 VISIT. MOST OF THE FARMS IN THE AREA  
 ARE ARABLE, AND PRODUCE MUCH OF THE   
 REGION'S CEREAL CROPS AND SUGAR-BEET. 
 THE TOWN IS A GOOD CENTRE FOR AN      
 INTERESTING COUNTRY HOLIDAY. HOLT HAS 
 A FINE PUBLIC SCHOOL FOUNDED BY SIR   
 JOHN GRESHAM IN{1555.                 </content>
