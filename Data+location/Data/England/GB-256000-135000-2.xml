		<title>02BARN DANCE</title>
		<content>{Nine or ten years ago there was the   
 first Barn Dance in Shirwell when     
 everybody got together and invited    
 their friends to Shirwell village hall
 for the dance. There is a band that   
 comes to play the music and there is a
 bar and buffet.   It is orgarnised by 
 the school's P.T.A. and any money that
 is raised goes to school funds.  Barn 
 dancing is very popular in North Devon
 as it would seem to be in most rural  
 areas.  Perhaps some of its popularity
 is due to the fact that a "caller"    
 describes the dance as the music is   
 playing and so you don't need to be   
 able to dance to take part.  The      
 P.T.A. of the school has also made a  
 tradition of an annual 'Disco' for    
 pupils of the school which is also    
 held at the village hall.
