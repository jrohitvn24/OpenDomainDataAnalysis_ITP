		<title>04The Train Station</title>
		<content>The station was built in 1902.There    
are three or four trains an hour in the
rush-hour and forty or fifty trains a  
week each way,going to places like High
Wycombe,Princess Risborough,Little     
Kimble,Gerrards Cross and Ruislip. The 
bridge on the station that goes from   
one platform to the other,was just     
being mended by putting a new roof on  
it.They did have one before but it     
started to collapse.So they took it    
apart and put it back together again.  
The types of people who come to the    
station are mostly commuters(which are 
working people)and housewives taking   
their children out for the day.The     
station is at its buisiest time in the 
morning because of all the commuters,  
but dies down at 11.00.There is a bike 
shed which costs 30p a day and 16      
pounds 50p a year.
