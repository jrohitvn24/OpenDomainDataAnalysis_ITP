Shutlanger isn't very big  and only has
one shop and thats a butchers.They     
have one pub and no school so most of  
the children go to Stoke Bruerne.      
   Most of the houses are old stone    
ones which have been repaired or       
rebuilt.There are a few council houses.
There are no factories so most people  
work in Northampton,Towcester or       
Milton Keynes.                         
    There is one chapel which is used  
by the Church Of England and the       
Methodist Church.
