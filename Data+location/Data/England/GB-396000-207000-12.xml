 village halls offer a variety of      
 activities: playgroups,youth clubs,   
 Women's Institutes,Mothers'           
 Unions,Keep Fit,British Legion,etc.   
 The nearest garage on the A417 is also
 the Centurion Cafe with a small shop. 
 In summer the Cricket Ground is well  
 used."Five Mile House" on the A417 is 
 the only Public House ,five miles from
 Cirencester.It is very quaint,like    
 walking into someone's living         
 room.There are 2 rooms ,one of which  
 has large oak settles for seating.    
 Most young people are involved in     
 country pursuits like horse-riding,   
 animals and walking.Gardening seems to
 be the most popular hobby with the    
 older inhabitants.
