		<content>                                       
 Most people in Chapel St Leonards live
 in bungalows,many of which have been  
 built in small estates during the last
 15 years.Nearly all these buildings   
 are built in brick brought mainly from
 Peterborogh by London Brick Co.Most of
 the houses/bungalows are privately    
 owned but there is ine council estate 
 with 20 houses which were built in    
 1953.Most buildings have sand/cement  
 tiles for roofs but some of the older 
 bungalows have asbestos tiles.The     
 Methodist Chapel and a row of 1930's  
 houses have Welsh slate tiles.There's 
 no piped gas in this area and most    
 houses use electricity,oil or solid   
 fuel for heating and cooking.Some use 
 Calor Gas.Several buildings have used 
 SOLAR PANELS.
