		<title>05Getting up on a school day</title>
		<content> Every school day my brother creeps in 
 and wakes me up at 7.25.  When he has 
 woken me up he makes a pain of        
 himself, he pretends to die all over  
 the place and we have an argument.    
 When it is summer I dress myself in   
 summer clothes but in the winter I    
 wear school uniform.  Then I go       
 downstairs to have some breakfast, I  
 always have Frosties.  I like them    
 because when I am sleepy they refresh 
 me.  I have a cup of tea with sugar   
 in.  Then I make sure I have got      
 everything in my bag for school.      
 After that I brush my teeth and wash  
 my face.  I always go to mum to have  
 my hair tied back.  At 8.25 I go out  
 and feed my rabbits, I give them oats,
 dandelions and water.  They are always
 hungry and come to the door to see me.
 At 8.30 I play the piano for ten      
 minutes.                              </content>
