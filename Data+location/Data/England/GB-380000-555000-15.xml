		<title>15A Day in the Life of A.Blair</title>
		<content> (cont.from p.14)  on a Friday only,I  
 meet the{0723}United bus which brings 
 me over 400 copies of Allendales      
 favourite newspaper,the Hexham        
 Courant.From now until about{8.50}it  
 is a race against the clock to "mark  
 up" all the daily papers which are    
 ordered,at the same time serving      
 children of aal shapes and sizes who  
 swarm into the shop scrambling for    
 sweets,crisps and pop to help them    
 through another day.                  
  Hopefully,at about{8.30}If have      
 finished the papers,my wife comes into
 the shop and I go upstairs for a quick
 "wash and brush" and then,if a school 
 day, I see Martin (my son) across the 
 road to school.                       
  Back into the shop for{9.00}_ this   
 time to the Post Office               
 counter.Straight into the safe and out
 with my stamps,postal orders,money etc</content>
