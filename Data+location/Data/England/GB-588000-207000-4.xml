		<title>04HISTORY OF GOLDHANGER CHURCH</title>
		<content> St.Peters Church was built in 11th    
 century.St.Peters is made from pudding
 stone and also flint.Round the back   
 of the church is some Roman remains   
 which were there before they built    
 the actual church.The chancel and     
 nave dwarfed by the massive tower and 
 buttresses were added 300 years later.
 The south aisle and door of the church
 were built or rebuilt rather late in  
 the 14th century and the southchapel  
 was made later.In 1836 the church     
 passed into the Leigh family.They     
 repaired the neglected and            
 dilapidated church.The south aisle    
 and chancel arch were rebulit and     
 window tracery was brought out and    
 new stained glass was put in.
