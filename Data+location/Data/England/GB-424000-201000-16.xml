		<title>16Farming in the Langford Area</title>
		<content>  There are eight farms in the area and
they grow corn and grass and keep dairy
and beef herds. Wheat is the main crop 
of the area.                           
  One of the farms has over 580 acres  
of land. In 1984 the farmer put 400    
acres to wheat and barley and 160 acres
to grass.                              
  The grass was grown and cut for      
silage and hay. He put 120 acres down  
for silage and the rest for hay. The   
grass for silage was put in the clamps 
covered with black plastic and weighted
down with old tyres.                   
  The farm produced over 900 tons of   
grain in 1984. The straw produed over  
15,000 bales of straw which was all    
used by the farmer for his beef and    
dairy herds.The grain was selling for  
about 100 pounds a ton.He sells his    
grain to a Corn Merchant in Calne in   
Wiltshire.                             </content>
