		<content> Mr.Lee is a beekeeper.He showed us how
 the bees live and the way they make   
 honey.The queen bee is the biggest bee
 but she doesn't rule them. If the bees
 want to leave a hive and she refuses  
 to go the bees kill her. The beekeeper
 has to have special clothing to       
 protect himself. Mr.England has kept  
 canaries since he was ten. He likes   
 their songs and colours.He breeds them
 every year. They lay eggs in June. Mr.
 Winter remembers when farming used to 
 be done by hand. The farmers would    
 have to get up at 4:30am and work a   
 lot longer hours than our farmers do  
 for a lot less pay. All the milking   
 was done by hand instead of by new    
 machines. The ground was ploughed by  
 horses and then the crops were planted
 by hand, now they use machines. Mr.   
 Winter has a collection of old farm   
 implements from those days.           </content>
