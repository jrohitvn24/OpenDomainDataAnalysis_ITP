 both near the centre of the village   
 The{Methodist church}is part of the   
 Queen's Road, Fairfield church.There  
 is a weekly Sunday School and a family
 service on the first Sunday of the    
 month. They have a morning service    
 April to October and in the afternoon 
 for the rest of the year.             
{St James' church}was built in{1910}as 
 a daughter church of the Burbage      
 Parish and would have been looked     
 after by a curate. Now it is part of  
 a team ministry also based on Burbage 
 Church. The team is led by the{Rev.   
{John Tomlinson,}rector since 1984.    
 Holy Communion(9am) &amp; Evensong(6pm)   
 are held on Sundays and there is a    
 Holy Communion service on Wednesday   
 morning too. There is an old          
 churchyard opposite the church.
