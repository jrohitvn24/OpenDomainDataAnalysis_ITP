		<title>14Our School Computer  Class 5</title>
		<content>Our school has a Research Machines Link
480Z computer and a single disc drive. 
We have just had a sponsored spell to  
raise money to buy a Turtle and a      
printer.                               
Each class has the computer in their   
room for about two double periods a    
week. We do all kinds of programs such 
as Arrow which is a logo program and   
Tiles in which we have to work out how 
many squares it would take to fill in  
the gaps in certain letters. We also   
have a program to help work out our    
Athletics Awards.                      
Over half of us have a computer at home
The most popular ones are Sinclair ZX  
Spectrum and Commodore 64. We use them 
for educational programs like Missing  
Words, decision programs like Osprey   
and Ring of Power and also for game    
programs. The two most popular games   
are Jet Set Willy and Pac Man.         </content>
