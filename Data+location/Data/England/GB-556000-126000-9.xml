		<title>09Housing In Mayfield.</title>
		<content> Mayfield has many very old houses,some
 half_timbered and dating back to the  
 15th century.There are only three very
 small blocks of purpose_built flats, 2
 especially for the elderly.Some of the
 largest houses have been divided into 
 flats.Mayfield has a small Council    
 Estate but a lot of the houses are now
 being bought by the residents.The     
 village has quite a number of         
 bungalows and nearly all homes have a 
 garden,often very large.The outskirts 
 of the village has many farmhouses and
 farmworkers' cottages.Some,including  
 some oast houses have been converted  
 into private homes and therefore      
 extensively modernised.Mayfield has   
 very few new house.A few have been    
 built along the site of the old       
 railway line and a few more behind the
 village.
