		<title>13Rotherwas Estate.</title>
		<content>  Rotherwas Estate is mentioned in the 
 original Domesday Book under Dinedor  
 Hundred.Until the beginning of the 1st
 World War it belonged to the Bodenham 
 family.                               
   The Estate was broken up and sold to
 smallholders. During the 1st World War
 it was used as an ordinance factory   
 and the land was retained by the      
 Ministry of Defence, until the 2nd    
 World War, when once again it was used
 as an ordinance factory.              
   During this period there was a      
 disastrous explosion, killing a number
 of people and a man called Mr. Little 
 was awarded the George Medal for his  
 bravery.The Germans bombed it once,   
 killing some people - this being the  
 only time Hereford experienced        
 bombing.                              
  After the 2nd World War the land was 
 not claimed back by the smallholders. </content>
