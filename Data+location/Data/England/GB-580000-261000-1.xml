		<title>01My Day Begins-Francis.Age 11</title>
		<content>My bodily clock rattles in my head dead
on time. 7.15 am. As usual, Dad stomps 
into the room, the half asleep hippo of
the awakening horizon. He always asks  
me what I want for breakfast. I say    
cereal and find out he's already got   
something cooking for me. I never eat  
it. I'm too tired. But it doesn't go to
waste. He eats it when he comes home   
from work.                             
I get up rather reluctantly at 7.45 am.
And that's not through my own          
conscience either; it's my sister.     
She's always harassing me in the       
mornings. I get up and wait for her to 
disappear. She's five years older than 
me. I can't wait for her to move out.  
No more blaring stereo. No more sickly 
hair spray. Total peace.               
In strolls Mum.                        
Thus ends my 30 seconds of tranquility.
