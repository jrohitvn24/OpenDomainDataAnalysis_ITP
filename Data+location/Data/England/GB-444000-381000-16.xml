		<title>16MORRIS DANCING-WALES VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{Morris Dancers}dance to folk music.   
 There used to be a Morris team for    
 every town. Now there are not so many 
 Luckily Wales village has a team,"The 
 Lord Conyer's Morris Men". They       
 practise once a week, usually at Wales
 Chapel.All the dancers are male.      
         On May Day morning they get up
 at 5.00 am.to dance all around South  
 Yorkshire. In the team there is a     
 "bagman", who writes the programme,and
 a "fool" who messes around and teases 
 the dancers.There is a "horse" who    
 dances but also goes round with a hat 
 to collect money from spectators.The  
 Morris Men say, "He is a retired pit  
 pony who is nine pence short of a     
 'bob'." The Morris Men aren't paid for
 dancing.Traditionally Morris dancing  
 was thought to make a special magic   
 which was meant to waken the plants of
 spring.                               </content>
