 and shops along both sides.A new home 
 for the elderly has just been built in
 the High Street where a garage used to
 be.In front of St.mary's church is the
 old hexagonal cage,now used as a bus  
 shelter.The cage used to be a{prison  
 for drunks and thieves.It originally  
 stood in the old market place and the 
 prisoners were lowered through a      
 pointed roof into it.In{Cage Lane}is  
 Bath Bungalow.This was the former     
{public baths.}On Friday afternoons    
 or Saturdays people could have a hot  
 bath costing 3d.Towels were not       
 provided ,but latterly bath cubes     
 could be bought for 1d.The baths were 
 useful because the old terraced houses
 had no bathrooms.These old houses have
 been demolished and new flats and     
 small houses have been built by the   
 council.                              </content>
