		<content> All Hallows Church is a splendid      
 survival from Mediaeval times. Among  
 the early features are the chancel    
 arch and the North door, dating from  
 before 1300, and a canopy tomb in the 
 north aisle with rare Lombardic       
 lettering. The tower was built in 14th
 century and bristles with gargoyles   
 and weird heads. The main rebuilding  
 was in 15th century when the beautiful
 roof was installed. One of the best   
 angel roofs in the country, this shows
 the Mediaeval craftsman at his most   
 competent. An angel motif is used on  
 the recently embroidered hassocks     
 which record much of the village's    
 local history.
