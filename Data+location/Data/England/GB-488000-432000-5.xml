		<title>05CHANGES MADE AT HOTHAM HALL</title>
		<content>    Hotham Hall was built in l7l0 and  
 there were further additions in 1782  
 and 1882.   Additional bathrooms have 
 been put in and central heating       
 replaced coal fires in bedrooms.  The 
 lake was dug out in 1968 using        
 machines.  Previous excavations had   
 been in 1898 using wheelbarrows and   
 spades.  Before electricity came to   
 Hotham it had its own generator and   
 once when an important visitor came,  
 one man had to stay with it all night 
 to stop the lights going out.  Two    
 land mines fell in 1952 causing       
 considerable damage to the Hall.      
 Historically, Hotham Hall was the     
 local landowner's home and they       
 possessed about 4000 acres, but now   
 the present owners have less than 30  
 acres.   Sadly the Hall had to be sold
 in 1985 but much of the land is still 
 farmed by the original owners.        </content>
