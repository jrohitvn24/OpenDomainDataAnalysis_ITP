		<content>   All that remains of the old church  
 is the chancel, which might be part   
 of the Norman church.   It is unused  
 and stands in the cemetery.  Warren   
 Hastings lived at Hastings House,     
 built on the site of an earlier Manor 
 house.                                
  Other buildings of interest were     
 erected by James Langston (younger) in
 the early 19thC.   They include       
 Sarsden Glebe, built for his rector   
 brother-in-law, Haughton House for the
 curate, and the Dower house at        
 Sarsgrove for his sister.             
  The Earl of Ducie erected a fountain 
 in the middle of the village in memory
 of Langston, and also built what is   
 now the Village Hall, as a reading    
 room.
