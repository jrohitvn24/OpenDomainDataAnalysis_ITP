		<title>02Kenneling Dogs in Killamarsh</title>
		<content> We walked down to the Kennels and     
 talked to the man who runs them. He is
 not the owner, but works for the woman
 who owns the property. He has worked  
 there two years. The dogs are taken a 
 walk once each day, but most kennels  
 do not take their dogs a walk. The    
 dogs are fed and given fresh water    
 each day and their kennels are cleaned
 out every day. There is only one dog  
 to each kennel unless they have two   
 from the same home. The manager enjoys
 his job very much because he likes    
 dogs although he always busy. The     
 telephone is often ringing with people
 booking in their pets. If a pet has to
 have medicine, they will do that and  
 if a pet is taken ill they will first 
 call the vet and then ask the owner's 
 permission for anything that needs to 
 be done. The dogs eat a soya mix which
 is much better for them than meat.    </content>
