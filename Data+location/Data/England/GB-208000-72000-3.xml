		<title>03Shepherd's year</title>
		<content>      In the spring of a shepherd's    
 year the main activity is lambing.Ewes
 often have singles and twins and      
 sometimes triplets and quads.Sometimes
 lambs can be born backwards and if you
 don't get there in time the lamb      
 usually dies.                         
      The next job is to dip them for  
 ticks.Ticks can get into the lambs    
 blood and if it gets too bad the lamb 
 dies.So we dip them and that kills the
 ticks.                                
      Shearing is an important thing   
 not many people shear.You have to book
 the shearers.We shear sheep so they   
 don't get too hot in the Summer.The   
 wool is sold for making into clothing.
      In the Summer the fat lambs are  
 sold for meat.Some ewe lambs are kept 
 for lambing next year.
