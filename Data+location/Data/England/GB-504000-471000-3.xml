		<title>03WOLD NEWTON VILLAGE (CONT)</title>
		<content>    The village is clustered around    
 the village pond and village green.   
 These occupy the site of a former     
 piece of common land which was always 
 damp and marshy. To celebrate the     
 Queen's Jubilee in 1977 the villagers 
 tidied the area and constructed a new 
 pond. The overflow from this pond     
 feeds into a natural pond known as    
 The Mere which in turn feeds the      
 Gypsey Race. Like the Gypsey Race this
 pond appears and disappears according 
 to the water level in the underground 
 reservoirs.                           
    The main facilities are directly   
 adjacent to the green - "The Anvil    
 Arms"(the village pub),telephone      
 kiosk,shop,post office and bus stop.  
    The village school,the cricket     
 field and the football field are all  
 nearby.
