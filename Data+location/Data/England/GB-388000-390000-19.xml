		<title>19A DAY AT PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  A normal school day starts at five to
 nine when the bell goes and we come in
 off the playground. When we get into  
 school we get our books out and go    
 into assembly. Assembly is when the   
 classes meet in the hall for a hymn,a 
 story and a prayer. After this we go  
 back to our classroom to work. In     
 lesson time we do Maths,English and   
 Reading. We have short breaks in the  
 morning and afternoon when we can play
 outside on the playground or on the   
 grass if it is fine. We have one hour 
 for dinner time. Some of us have      
 school dinners,others bring sandwiches
 from home. At twenty past three,the   
 bell rings for the end of school.     
 After school we sometimes have clubs  
 for activities like athletics. We use 
 our hall for physical education as    
 well as assemblies. Our school is     
 called Broadstone Hall Primary.       </content>
