		<title>01Introducing North St Ives.</title>
		<content> The North St.Ives area includes RAF   
 Wyton, two housing estates and part of
 the village of Woodhurst.             
  The Old Ramsey Road leads up to RAF  
 Wyton,but does not lead into the base.
  On the verges of this road you can   
 find Cowslips, various grasses and    
 nettles. This is because hardly anyone
 uses or dumps household rubbish on the
 verges. This road is seldom disturbed.
  The Wyton RAF base has  Bloodhound   
 missiles and various planes  and      
 helicopters.                          
   Woodhurst is a small village on the 
 outskirts of North St.Ives.It, like   
 St.Ives has historical interests.This 
 is because an ancient road circles the
 whole village.                        
  North St.Ives has about 10 shops and 
 4 estates,mainly new single or family 
 detached or semi-detached houses.
