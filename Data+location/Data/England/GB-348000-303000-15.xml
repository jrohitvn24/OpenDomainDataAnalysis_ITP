		<title>15BUILDINGS-THE PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The original parish church of        
 St.Andrew and St.Mary was built of    
 wood in Saxon times and on the same   
 site as the existing church.When the  
 Normans came they knocked it down and 
 rebuilt it in the Norman style.The    
 Norman church was built of red        
 sandstone with round windows,round    
 arches and massive pillars.The tower  
 of the church collapsed and fell into 
 the nave destroying that as well.So   
 the present nave and tower was built  
 between 1962 and 1964.The outside of  
 the  south transept is distinguished  
 by a splendid half timber gable end   
 frame work dating back to the middle  
 ages.Whilst inside the finest feature 
 must be the hammer beams supporting   
 the very large and heavy roof.There   
 are eight bells hung in the tower.
