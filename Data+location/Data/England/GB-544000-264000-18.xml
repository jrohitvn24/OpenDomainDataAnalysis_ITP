 When we interviewed Mrs.Chapman one of
 the Questions was (What animals do you
 have?)and the answer was none but we  
 used to have some pigs.As well as many
 other things we learnt that not every 
 farm has animals and where sugar_beet 
 goes after its grown.First the        
 sugar_beet is loaded into a lorry and 
 taken to the suger factory and checked
 ,if the lorries are overloaded the    
 sugar_beet is refused or if it not    
 sweet enough it is refused only when  
 it is perfect is it made into sugar.
