 The day I have chosen to write about  
 is Wednesday. In my family I have one 
 brother, Rob, and Mum and Dad.        
   The day begins when I wake up at six
 o'clock and go to the shop to do my   
 paper round. I never run around my    
 round. I like to just go for a nice   
 walk in the village. When I return to 
 my house my mum normally has the      
 toast and coffee on so I wash my hands
 and have breakfast. While I am eating 
 my breakfast my brother normally comes
 rumbling down the stairs still half   
 asleep.                               
   At about eight twenty my friend     
 Andrew calls. We then put our bags in 
 the car and my dad drives us to school
 on his way to work. I hate school on  
 Wednesdays because we have Maths and  
 Environmental Studies all day.        </content>
