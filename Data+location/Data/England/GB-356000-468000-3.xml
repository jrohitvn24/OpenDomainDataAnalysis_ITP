		<content>There has been a church in Hornby      
since at least the 12th. Century.  The 
Parish Church of St. Margaret of       
Antioch possesses a rare octagonal     
tower which was built in 1513 by Lord  
Monteagle. The church possesses a      
"Loaves and Fishes" Cross which is     
over 1000 years old and is the only    
one in this country. The church also   
has an altar front and vestments on    
display which are of Italian origin.   
Across the road is the Roman Catholic  
Church of St. Mary's which can seat no 
more than 15 or so.                    
Across the valley, at St. John's       
Church in Gressingham there is the     
sculptured remains of a pre Norman     
cross. The nave is separated from the  
chancel by a pointed arch and  a       
Norman style tower arch soars over the 
font. St. John's dates from the 13th.  
Century.                               </content>
