		<title>02Adisham History Overview</title>
		<content>      Adisham is an ancient settlement.
The Saxon King Aedbald gave it a       
Charter in 616 A.D. and it was         
recorded in the original Domesday      
survey. The name is Saxon and derives  
from the ham or home of Aedde's people 
who settled there and sunk wells for   
water. The other small places also     
have names of Saxon derivation.        
Cooting means the followers of Coot.   
Bloodden was the rent from a plot of   
land fixed as a blood rent for a       
wounding. Bossington was a fortified   
homestead or ton of the followers of   
Bos. The Parish Church is 800 years    
old. John Bland, Rector, a radical     
heretic was burned at Canterbury under 
the Maryan persecution. The village    
was the home of John Reynolds, a       
pioneer of the Agricultural Revolution.
He introduced the Swedish turnip in the
18th Century, planting trial rows.     </content>
