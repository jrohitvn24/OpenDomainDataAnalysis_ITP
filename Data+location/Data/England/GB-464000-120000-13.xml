		<title>13WARDEN - OLD WINCHESTER HILL</title>
		<content> Our site includes a pre-historic hill 
 fort which has been designated a      
 National Nature Reserve since 1954    
 because of its importance for         
 Conservation. It is one of many 'NNR's
 in Britain which protect key wildlife 
 habitats, so maintaining a valuable   
 national heritage.                    
 The habitat found at Old Winchester   
 hill is chalk downland and is         
 characterised by many rare and        
 beautiful plant and butterfly species,
 and maintained by a flock of sheep.   
 There are two wardens on site and we  
 work for the Nature Conservancy       
 Council.Our work involves patroling,  
 fending our sheep, fencing, tree      
 felling, wildlife surveys, educational
 and management planing. A wonderful   
 occupation !
