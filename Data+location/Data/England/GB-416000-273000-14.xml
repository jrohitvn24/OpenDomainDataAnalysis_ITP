		<content> For a small village the sports        
 facilities are very good.There are two
 excellent cricket grounds which       
 attract players living outside the    
 area and within the boundaries of one 
 of the grounds are two tennis courts  
 and two squash courts.                
 A golf driving range with a resident  
 professional and shop is a facility   
 used by many of the local residents.  
 The village hall and local church and 
 school halls are used by badminton    
 enthusiasts who organise their own    
 clubs.
