		<title>18The King's Sutton Newspaper</title>
		<content>    The King's Sutton Times is a       
 duplicated newspaper which is         
 published by the Parish Council, four 
 times a year, and distributed free to 
 every house.   It tells people what is
 happening in the village and gives    
 some news, but most of all people can 
 air their complaints.                 
    In the latest issue there are      
 complaints about those who cannot be  
 bothered to take their big rubbish to 
 the Farthinghoe tip and dump it       
 instead in Newbottle Woods, a         
 favourite place for walks.   Dog      
 owners are taken to task for allowing 
 their pets to run wild on the Rec etc.
    The Parish Council want the        
 relatives of those buried in the      
 Cemetery to volunteer to help keep the
 place tidier.
