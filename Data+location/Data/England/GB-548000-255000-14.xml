		<title>14Cherry Hinton Hall</title>
		<content> Cherry Hinton Hall is along Cherry    
 Hinton Road.It is very big.One of the 
 areas is taken up by two big          
 ponds.They are full of ducks.Some     
 ducks are rare,for instance the       
 Mandarin duck and three other rare    
 ducks from the Far East.Also there are
 fishes in there.One which is 20cm long
  is called Jaws by most people.       
    Another part of the park is a play 
 area with swings,roundabouts,climbing 
 frames,slides and a big tyre death    
 slide.Near the swings is a little part
 like a forest to play in.Cherry Hinton
 Hall is in between the play area and  
 the pond.It is not open though.Often  
 bands visit the Hall and lots of      
 people come.Each year there is a big  
 Folk Festival where  people come from 
 all over the country.It is held in    
 July.
