		<title>15The life of Mr Alman 2</title>
		<content> The church is 100 yards from their    
 home.Mr Alman has memories of the     
 second World War,they are the air     
 raid .When the siren went they all had
 to go in the air raid shelters but if 
 you were on civil defence duty you had
 to wear steel helmets and a gas mask. 
 When the German bomber went over they 
 dropped a flare which lit up their    
 target so they could see where they   
 were bombing.The rationing was telling
 the English how much food and things  
 could have.For clothes they had       
 coupons which they had to beg for,and 
 they also had coupons for their       
 wedding clothes.The anxious times were
 when the Germans were bombing Crewe   
 and the army was on duty amongst it   
 all.The happiest memory was when the  
 war was all over,that was V day.Then  
 there were parties,singing in the     
 street and happy ever after.          </content>
