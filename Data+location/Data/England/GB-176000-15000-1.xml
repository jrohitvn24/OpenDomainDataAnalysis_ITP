		<content> General view of Blackhead             
 A lonely area with no through roads   
 bounded by rocky cliffs facing south  
 and east.There are three main farm    
 clusters each with a couple of recent 
 houses or bungalows built near them   
 and two separate farms.               
 Several recent villas and bungalows   
 have been built along the road to     
 Coverack to the north of the area     
 mainly occupied by retired incomers.  
 The Headland Hotel is on the edge of  
 Coverack Village and the Drawbar club 
 is a focal social point for a large   
 area.                                 
 There are approximately 25 family     
 units.                                
 The National Trust has purchased about
 1 Kilometre of Coastal land in the    
 Downas valley.
