 few puppies are bred here but most are
 bought in and if they seem dirty then 
 they are given a bath.Thet are fed    
 three times a day on mince and        
 biscuits.The most popular puppy is the
 Jack Russell terrier;the youngest     
 puppy is a 6 week old German Shepherd.

 and Dobermans - are kept for a        
 security firm in the town.Most are    
 trained at a large yard at the centre 
 but Tara was trained by an ex police  
 dog handler at Easington Village.The  
 dogs eat mince or tripe(it smells) and
 biscuits once a day.Toya the oldest is
 6years;Abbey the youngest is 10
