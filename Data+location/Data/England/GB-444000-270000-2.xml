		<title>02CHANGE IN THURLASTON -1</title>
		<content>Thurlaston , mentioned in the          
Domesday Book of 1086 as TORLAVESTONE, 
has had various owners including the   
Monks of Pipewell in Northamptonshire  
(13th-16th century).They built a Grange
(farm).Four houses have been built on  
the old moat field ,now Moat Close.    
Before 1717 strips were cultivated in  
open fields.Between 1717-1729 enclosure
took place as agreed by the Duke of    
Montagu, Lord of the Manor.This closed 
the common land cultivated by the      
villagers.This act caused great        
hardship but improved                  
agriculture.Farming still remains      
important in the surrounding area.     
The village used to grow grapes.The    
headmaster of Rugby School was a local 
customer.The stocks in Main Street,    
used  into the 19th century,became     
delapidated until restored in recent   
years.                                 </content>
