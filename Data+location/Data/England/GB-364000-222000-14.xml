		<content>   Mr.Charlie Cole was born in 1899.He 
 has lived and worked all his life in  
 our area.His parents occupied a small 
 holding of about 4 acres where they   
 kept 3 cows whose milk they sold to   
 customers in the nearby village of    
 Pontshill.                            
   He attended school from the age of  
 four and his earliest memories are of 
 walking to school at Weston,some 2    
 miles away loaded with milk cans;full 
 in the morning and empty in the       
 evening.He also remembers spinning his
 top on the way to school along what is
 now the busy A40 without meeting a    
 horse and trap.                       
   At the age of 13 he left school and 
 after trying various jobs he looked   
 after the home farm and became a coal 
 merchant supplying coal from the      
 Forest of Dean.He has worked on most  
 of the farms here and knows them well.</content>
