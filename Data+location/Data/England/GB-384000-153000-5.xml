 The  Baptist Church was built in 1961.
 They used to baptised people in the   
 river Biss until the Church was built.
                                       
 The Church has no altar and only two  
 stain glass windows.Its a very light  
 place and warm.It has a baptising pool
 instead of a font.The seats are       
 origanal out of the old church.The    
 pulpit is in the middle it has two    
 ways up.The baptising pool is in front
 of it.
