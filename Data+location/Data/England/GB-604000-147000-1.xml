		<content> There are no schools in the area      
 covered by this report. Children,     
 unless educated privately, begin      
 school at the Lady Joanna Thornhill   
 School, Wye, at the beginning of the  
 term following their fifth birthday.  
 Special buses are provided by the Kent
 County Council to get the children to 
 school, those living three miles plus 
 from the school travelling free, while
 others  may use the transport but pay 
 a concessional fare.                  
 The children spend six years at       
 Primary School and then those living  
 at Crundale and within the boundary of
 the Canterbury area will go to schools
 in Canterbury selected to suit the    
 child's academic ability. The others  
 will go mainly to the Towers School,  
 Ashford where they may move on to     
 Upper School at the age of thirteen.
