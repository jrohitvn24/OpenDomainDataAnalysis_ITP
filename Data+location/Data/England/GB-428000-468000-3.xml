		<title>03Developing the Moor.</title>
		<content>  {The Quarry Moor Development         
{Association}are hoping to develop the 
 land as a place for children to play. 
 However, in order to apply for grants 
 from bodies like the{Sports Council   
 and the{National Playing Fields       
{Association,}the Development          
 Association requires a lease.         
 Hopefully,with rightful ownership     
 being given to the City Council,this  
 can now be acquired.                  
  The Association have already done a  
 great deal of work on the site. This  
 includes the building of a Trim Track,
 seeding a games area, providing       
 opportunities for nature walks and    
 building an activities centre for use 
 by organised groups. The area is of   
 some interest to the{National         
{Conservancy Council}as a variety of   
 rare plants and associated wildlife   
 has been discovered.                  </content>
