		<title>03Farming around Debenham (1)</title>
		<content>Twenty-five years ago,most farmers in  
the area kept cattle,sheep and pigs.   
Arable crops consisted mainly of wheat 
and barley.The change to more corn     
crops,accelerated by entry into the    
EEC, led to a decline in livestock.    
Now,only one farmer in the area keeps  
pigs and only one has sheep.This       
farmer,renowned for his skill with     
pedigree Suffolks and a national judge 
of sheep, is unlikely to part with his 
flock.                                 
   Ten years ago,there were three      
large herds of dairy cattle in the     
area. Because of over-production       
of milk, farmers who disposed of their 
herds were offered compensation.The    
herds disappeared almost overnight.    
The result was that the last areas of  
pasture,some undisturbed since         
medieval times,went under the plough.  
Plant and insect species were reduced. </content>
