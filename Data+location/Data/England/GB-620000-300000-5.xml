		<content> The village of Dunston covers 650     
 acres and has a population of 52. The 
 majority of these are elderly with    
 only 7 children. It is extremely hard 
 to find work in the village so they   
 have to gop elsewhere to find a job.  
 One farme only employs 3 in the summer
 and 0 in the winter; this is due to   
 modern machinery.                     
 For many years there have been few    
 changes to the houses, extensions     
 only being allowed. Electricity and   
 water were brought to the village in  
 1960. The most notable feaatures of   
 the hamlet are the Hall, but          
 principally the Common of about 7     
 acres, used for dog walking, picnics  
 and quiet enjoyment. The common       
 belongs to the Sout Norfolk District  
 Council, although the villagers       
 maintain their grazing rights.
