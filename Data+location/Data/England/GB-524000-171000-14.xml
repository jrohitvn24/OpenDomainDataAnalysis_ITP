		<title>14Wimbledon Football Ground</title>
		<content>The football pitch is in excellent     
condition.To the right is a huge       
stand where there is usually trouble.An
iron railing prevents fans running onto
the pitch.To the right again are more  
stands.These are for the away team     
supporters.All stands are made of      
very flimsy wood, but the ground is    
going to be improved in 1986, to avoid 
the danger of fire.A small whistle is  
blown and play begins.The fans cheer   
on their teams and groan at missed     
chances.They wave scarves and songs.   
At each match there is a small child,  
dressed in miniature kit, who plays    
the part of the club mascot.The club's 
nickname is Wimbledon Super Dons.
