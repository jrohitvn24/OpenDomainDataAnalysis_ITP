		<content> THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN AT OUR SCHOOL   
 ARE THE FIVE YEAR OLDS IN THE         
 RECEPTION CLASSES. THIS TERM THEY HAVE
 BEEN STUDYING WATER. HERE IS WHAT BETH
 HAS WRITTEN ABOUT WATER, "WE USE WATER
 AT HOME FOR WASHING THE CAR AND HAVING
 A BATH AND WASHING THE DOG AND WASHING
 THE CAT." THE OLDER INFANTS, SIX AND  
 SEVEN YEARS OLD, HAVE BEEN FINDING OUT
 ABOUT HOMES AND FAMILIES AND HAYLEY   
 HAS WRITTEN, "I AM 7 YEARS OLD AND    
 I LIVE IN GREAT WAKERING, ESSEX. I    
 HAVE FAIR HAIR AND BLUE EYES. MY BEST 
 FRIENDS ARE EMMA AND DIANA. I LIVE IN 
 A SEMI-DETACHED HOUSE AND I HAVE TWO  
 SECRET HIDING PLACES. I HAVE A BOOK   
 CASE AND A TOY CUPBOARD. I HAVE ONE   
 PET AND HE MAKES A LOT OF MESS AND HE 
 IS A HAMSTER AND HIS NAME IS HENRY."  
 AT SEVEN YEARS OLD THE CHILDREN MOVE  
 TO JUNIOR CLASSES.                    
                                       </content>
