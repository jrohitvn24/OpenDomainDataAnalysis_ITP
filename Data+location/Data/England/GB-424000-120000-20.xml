		<title>20Life on a farm</title>
		<content> About 2 months ago we moved to North  
 Common Farm. It is very nice there.   
 During the last few weeks we have     
 been making silage.They have cut      
 5 fields now, and they have just      
 finished.They  cover black material   
 over the silage and after that they   
 stick this black tape on it.After     
 they  have  done that they have to    
 cover a load of tyres all over it     
 so it won't blow off.On our farm we   
 have horses, chickens, rabbits,       
 guinea_pigs, dogs, puppys, cows,      
 calves and pigs. we had 3 full        
 pigsties of pigs, but we sold them all
 except one because its leg was very   
 bad. Sometimes I get the eggs from the
 chickens and we get at least 4 or 5   
 buckets of eggs from the chickens a   
 day.
