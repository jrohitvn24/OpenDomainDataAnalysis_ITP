		<title>11  Visit to Flatford Mill</title>
		<content>    On Monday the 24th June 1985 a     
 group from our school went to{Flatford
 Field Study Centre for an{education   
 visit week. We stayed in Willy Lotts  
 Cottage.                              
    On a typical day in the morning we 
 had to get up at 7 o/clock and then   
 wash ourselves and clean our teeth.   
 Then we had breakfast. After breakfast
 we made our packed lunches.           
    On the first day we found out about
 John Constable the artist who lived   
 in{Dedham.}On Tuesday we went to the  
 paddock to look at food chains. We    
 took the things we found away to      
 examine. On Tuesday afernoon we went  
{birdwatching}and we saw a redshank    
 and a kestrel. On Wednesday we looked 
 at how a woodland works. On Thursday  
 we went mammal trapping and pond      
 dipping. We caught 14 bank voles. On  
 Friday we came home.                  </content>
