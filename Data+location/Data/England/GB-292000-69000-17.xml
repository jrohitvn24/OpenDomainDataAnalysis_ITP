		<title>17A LOCAL WILDLIFE SANCTUARY</title>
		<content>   Shaldon Wildlife Park is situated   
near the Ness and opened in I965. There
are over a 100 animals many of which   
are rare breeds. For example there are 
only 7 Lemurs in England and the Park  
has 2 of them, a male and female which 
they hope will breed.                  
   The animals are mainly small breeds 
and range from Harvest Mice to Monkey  
Gibbons and from Mynah Birds to Great  
Eagle Owls.                            
   The owner's favourite animal is the 
Coati because it is a brillant escape  
artist and is usually to be found on   
top of the cage.                       
   Every week the animals consume over 
1,000 insects and 100 pounds of fruit. 
In order to help cover the cost of this
the Park is a registered charity and   
they sell badges, puzzles, posters etc.
   One of the main aims of the Park is 
to educate people to live with animals.</content>
