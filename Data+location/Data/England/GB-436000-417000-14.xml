		<title>14Keeping Racing Pigeons.</title>
		<content> Both our dads keep racing pigeons.    
 They keep the pigeons in sheds at the 
 bottom of the garden. We both have    
 over 50 birds. All the family help    
 look after them. We feed them corn and
 clean them out every day and each day 
 they are allowed to fly free. When    
 they are being trained the birds are  
 taken away from home and released. If 
 they come back, this is then repeated 
 over longer distances. In a race birds
 are put in a basket and sent off in   
 vans with other peoples pigeons. They 
 are released together. When they get  
 home a ring on their leg is stamped by
 a special clock. The fastest time     
 wins. The winner of races usually wins
 money.
