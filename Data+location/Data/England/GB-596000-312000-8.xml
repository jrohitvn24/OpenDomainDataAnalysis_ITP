		<content> Dereham, heart of Norfolk, is a busy  
 thriving shopping centre and market   
 town for a wide area with fast growing
 population.  Free parking attracts    
 drivers from surrounding villages,    
 buses link with villages and large    
 towns and cities. Dating back to 7th  
 Century its streets were not built for
 large vehicles of to-day which cause  
 congestion in servicing local shops.  
 The recent by  pass has however eased 
 the traffic problem. There is a wide  
 variety of well stocked shops and     
 businesses, but multiple stores       
 dominate often causing local shops to 
 close. Long established family        
 industrial firms have suffered too in 
 the recent recession, but others have 
 taken over and hopes are high. The    
 market square is busy on Market days  
 when villagers buy, meet friends and  
 catch up with the local news.         </content>
