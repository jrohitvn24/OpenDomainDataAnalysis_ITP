		<content>    The church stands at the northern  
 end of the village street. It was     
 founded 806 years ago. the oldest     
 parts of the building are probably    
 12th century. The chancel is approx-  
 imately a century older. The east     
 window and tower are perpendicular.   
 The other parts were added in 1886.   
 The tower contains one of the oldest  
 dated bells in England(1482).         
    The Rev.P.H.Pollak is the vicar. He
 is also rector of Holt and Rural Dean 
 of eighteen parishes.                 
    Services are held once and twice on
 alternate Sundays. Holy Communion is  
 also held on Wednesday morning. The   
 school also holds services in the     
 church on festival occasions.         
    In 1984 there were 24 christenings,
 approximately 10 weddings and 20      
 burials. It costs approximately Â£3000 
 to keep the church running.           </content>
