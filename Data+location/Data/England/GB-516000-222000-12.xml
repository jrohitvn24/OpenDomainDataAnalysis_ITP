		<title>12A GAMEKEEPER'S LIFE,PRESTON</title>
		<content> A keeper's day starts very early in   
 the morning.His job is to look after  
 his beat and his pheasants.The year   
 starts when the shooting has finished 
 in January.First he catches up the    
 hens and cocks to put in the laying   
 pens.Laying begins in April and the   
 eggs are picked up twice a day and    
 washed and trayed ready for the incu_ 
 bator.After 3 weeks in the incubator  
 the eggs are transferred to a hatcher.
 After hatching the chicks are placed  
 in specially heated pens and looked   
 after very carefully.At 6 weeks old   
 the poults move to small pens in the  
 wood and a week later are released in_
 to the wild.The keeper still feeds    
 them and looks after them until the   
 shooting season starts in October.Then
 the whole thing starts all over again.
 It is a busy life,but interesting.
