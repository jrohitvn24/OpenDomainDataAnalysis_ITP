		<content> I found out that most children        
 preferred{fast food.}More healthy food
 like{salads}was the least popular.    
 Adults preferred{home cooking}or      
{eating out.}Of 27 people surveyed 9   
 people preferred eating out, 10 people
 preferred home cooking, 5 people      
 preferred fast food, of which fish    
 and chips is still the most           
 popular kind, and 3 people preferred  
 salads.                               
 An example of favourite home cooking  
 was a traditional English roast meat  
 and vegetables. In the area of fast   
 food beefburgers came top.            
 Fizzy{drinks}were favoured by young   
 children; adults preferred tea or     
 coffee.                               
 The most popular time to eat the main 
 meal of the day was in the evening    
 with their families.
