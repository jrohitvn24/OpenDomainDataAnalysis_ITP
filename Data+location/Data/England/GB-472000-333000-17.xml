		<title>17LANGAR AIRFIELD</title>
		<content> In the second world war the land to   
 the south of Langar was used to make  
 an{airfield.Lancaster bombers}were    
 serviced and repaired after nightly   
 raids into Germany.                   
 The American  Airforce and later the  
 Canadians were stationed here.In the  
 later part of the war it was also used
 as a{prisoner of war camp }and during 
 their stay the prisoners became an    
 accepted part of village life.        
 After the war many villagers worked in
 the hangars making peace time aircraft
 for{Hawker Siddley Aviation.          
 When this firm closed new industries  
 moved in like{Reed Corrugated Cases   
 and{John Deere}Tractors.Many villagers
 still work at these factories.        
 The airfield today is mostly farmland 
 but it is also used for parachuting.
