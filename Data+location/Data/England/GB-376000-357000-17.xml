		<content> My Dad is the first to get up in the  
 morning. He goes to work at Hay's     
 Chemicals. He sets off to work at 6:50
 At that time my Mum is working nights 
 at Roadchef on the motorway. She goes 
 to work at 10:00pm and sells petrol,  
 sweets, fizzy drinks and cigarettes.  
 She comes home at 7:20am. My Mum makes
 breakfast when my sister and I come   
 down and then we get ready for school.
 When my Mum has taken us to school she
 will come home, tidy up and put Roly  
 our dog outside for a couple of       
 minutes. If she is working she will   
 let Roly back in and go to bed. If she
 isn't she will do washing or baking or
 shopping or simply nothing. When we   
 get home the tele is put on. I help   
 fetch the tea things in the front room
 and I watch a few programmes on the   
 tele. I go to bed fairly late. We read
 for 10 minutes then I go to sleep.    </content>
