		<title>17      TALKING POINT</title>
		<content> The main conversation now is whether  
 or not to have a marina for small pri-
 vate yachts and fishing boats by      
 extending the harbour.This extension  
 could include a roll on roll off car  
 and passenger ferry possibly to Wales 
 France or Ireland.Not every body      
 agrees,about half of the people are   
 for the idea and the other half are   
 against it.I like the idea.People     
 are also thinking about having a chair
 lift or cable car from the top of     
 Hillsborough down to the harbour or   
 pier.The police are very concerned    
 about the amount of B.M.X. bikes on   
 the road.There used to be a track on  
 Hillsborough but the council closed it
 down quite a long time ago, and now   
 the police want to either build one   
 somewhere where there is a lot of     
 space or they would like to reopen the
 one at Hillsborough.                  </content>
