		<title>12INDUSTRY IN WIGAN</title>
		<content>  In our part of Wigan there are many  
{factories}and{warehouses.}We saw some 
 when we were on a walk and others from
 the barge "Kittywake" on the Leeds -  
 Liverpool Canal. Some of the firms we 
 saw included Gridweld, who make metal 
 mesh; Great Universal Stores, a mail  
 order firm; Wigan Newspapers; Magnet  
 Southern, timber suppliers; Greens    
 Carpets; Mayalls, paint and decoration
 suppliers and Walmsleys, paper-making 
 machinery works (now closed).         
  We went into the{Gridweld}factory    
 where lots of people were making      
{metal mesh.}Metal strips are welded   
 together and used for fencing football
 grounds or just in the garden. Big    
 machines do all the work. They coil   
 the steel up, weld it, press it and   
 put it into rolls. Then it is sold and
 delivered in different sizes.
