		<title>02PRINCIPAL ROADS IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content> The A38 cuts through Bathpool and the 
 A361 cuts through Monkton Heathfield. 
 During the late 1950's,1960's &amp; early 
 1970's when traffic was increasing,the
 2 roads were very busy indeed. However
 in 1975 the completion of the motorway
 (M5) reduced the traffic on the A.38  
 greatly and to a lesser extent on the 
 A.361 which is the main Minehead and  
 Barnstaple road.                      
 The M5,which runs down into Devon and 
 up to the Midlands and the M4,has en- 
 abled both commercial and private in- 
 terest in the area.For example,Langdon
 Industries,which is a haulage firm,are
 based at Walford Cross;and the current
 owner of Langaller House is a London  
 insurance broker. He travels to London
 on Mondays and returns to Somerset for
 the weekend.His wife does not go with 
 him to London because she prefers the 
 tranquillity of Langaller.            </content>
