  We are doing a survey in Wash Common 
 to find the result of a list of       
 questions we have asked various age   
 groups about the type of clothes      
 people would wear for casual, special 
 occasions and parties or disco. We    
 have also been talking to people about
 hte colours they wear. We have        
 interveiwed 5-6 year olds and 8-9 year
 olds. They like wearing T-shirts with 
 skirts or shorts. The favourite       
 colours are blue, green and red for   
 the boys and white, pink, yellow and  
 green for the girls. The 15 year olds 
 we found, liked to wear baggy trousers
 and big shirts, skirts and shorts. The
 colours they preferred to wear this   
 year were pastel colours like white,  
 pale blue and pale green. Some liked  
 heavier colours like black.
