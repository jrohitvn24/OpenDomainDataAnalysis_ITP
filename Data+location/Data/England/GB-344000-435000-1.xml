 The following pages are all about our 
 12 kilometre squares which consist of 
 three small villages Catforth,Inskip  
 and Wharles.All of our block contains 
 farmland but one village is mainly    
 residential and parts are occupied by 
 a military defence base.There are 4   
 different types of farming round us:  
 dairy farming,pig farming,poultry     
 farming and crops.Of these dairy      
 farming is most common.The military   
 defence base is a radio station but   
 some of the land is used by farmers to
 graze sheep. The nearest town is      
 Preston.The land round here is very   
 flat.The hedges are well kept and the 
 fields vary in size.Because we are    
 close to the west coast,the weather is
 often windy and wet but winters are   
 fairly mild.                          </content>
