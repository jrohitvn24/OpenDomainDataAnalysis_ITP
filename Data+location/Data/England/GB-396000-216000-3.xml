		<title>03COBERLEY VILLAGE: POPULATION</title>
		<content> Coberley is a very quiet and          
 secluded village. Most people who live
 there are middle aged in between 30   
 and 50. They all believe Coberley is  
 very friendly. The people move to     
 Coberley because of the beautiful     
 scenery and also the fact that the    
 houses are within the people's price  
 range. Most of the people there go to 
 work in Cheltenham and most workers   
 use cars to get there. When people    
 leave school most of them leave       
 Coberley in order to find jobs. There 
 is also another reason for them to    
 leave the village. When young couples 
 move in they may well stay for only   
 five or so years. This is because the 
 houses are small and when the couple  
 have a family they will need a larger 
 house and so they will be forced to   
 move.
