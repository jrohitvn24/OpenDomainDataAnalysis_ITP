 Glasshouse Mill began as a corn mill, 
 then in 1814 it became a flax mill.   
 In 1828 the Metcalfes bought the      
 Mill and operated it until 1914.      
 During their time at the Mill the     
 Metcalfes added to the buildings;at   
 the peak of its business the Mill     
 employed 400 people, and produced a   
 variety of linen threads, they also   
 built houses for their workers around 
 the Mill which became known as        
 Glasshouses and a school for their    
 employees' children.                  
 They were very benevolent employers as
 they were concerned with the welfare  
 of their workers and their families.  
 When the Atkinsons bought the Mill in 
 1914 they started producing string    
 instead of flax to meet an increase in
 the demand for string.                
 The Mill stopped production in 1972.  </content>
