		<title>19Housing in Middleton</title>
		<content> The civil parish contains 62 dwellings
 including three council houses, four  
 council flats, a private house and two
 bungalows. Until the 1950's all the   
 houses except Rock Cottage, two       
 outlying bungalows built between the  
 wars, and Smerill Grange were owned by
 the Waterhouse family of Middleton    
 Hall, as part of the Middleton Estate.
 Now the estate owns only 8 cottages.  
 Most dwellings and farms are owner    
 occupied but six are used as holiday  
 homes and let when not required by    
 their owners.                         
 Most buildings are of limestone with  
 dressed gritstone door and window     
 surrounds. There are 10 homes in new  
 buildings, 2 in converted barns and 1 
 in a converted chapel. There are      
 several farm buildings of sheet steel 
 or asbestos.
