		<content> This farmer was optimistic about the  
 future. He said that farmers must     
 become more flexible and be prepared  
 for change.  He pointed out that      
 farming has improved the appearence of
 the area, because without farming the 
 scene would quickly revert to scrub.  
 This farmer, like many others today,  
 is becoming  more aware of the        
 ecological and environmental aspects  
 of farming. "Farmers are having to    
 listen to public opinion and take     
 appropriate action. Farming will need 
 to become much more aware of it role  
 as a provider of recreational         
 opportunites in the countryside."
