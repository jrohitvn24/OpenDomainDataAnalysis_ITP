 Concert and the decorations in the    
 hall. A video tape of the concert is  
 stored in our{DOMESDAY BOX}buried near
 school,I wonder if someone will watch 
 it in 100 years from now!Our Pantomime
 was lots of fun and it was good to    
 hear laughter from so many people at  
 once.                                 
 We had a Christmas Dinner and invited 
 parents and friends to share this with
 us. We borrowed tables and chairs from
 the chapel and in the afternoon we all
 watched a video film for a treat. We  
 had a party one evening and I remember
 doing the Conga all through school. We
 played games and danced. I liked it   
 when everybody danced Agadoo and we   
 were all out of time. After the party 
 we all set off to go Carol Singing    
 around the village....................
