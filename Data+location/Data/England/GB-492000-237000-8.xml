 A start is then made to prepare for   
 the next harvest with powerful and

 period crops are sprayed from the air 
 by light aircraft using pesticide in  
 order to kill pests and herbicide to  
 increase growth. Some farmers do cut  
 hedgerows out to accommodate modern   
 machinery.  The removal of hedgerows  
 in this district has not been widely  
 carried out and there are still some  
 ancient hedgerows two to three hundred
 years old which are still intact and  
 flourishing. One small farm is an     
 animal sanctuary, a home for unwanted 
 and lost domestic animals.
