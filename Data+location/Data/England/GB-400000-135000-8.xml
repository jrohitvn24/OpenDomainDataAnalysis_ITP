		<content> I am the Rector of five churches,     
 Steeple Langford, Little Langford,    
 Wylye, Fisherton de-la-Mere and       
 Stockton.                             
 My main duty is to conduct services on
 Sundays,usually two Holy Communions,a 
 Matins and an Evensong.I also christen
 and marry people and bury the dead.I  
 preach sermons,to guide and teach     
 those who hear me.I also try to teach 
 the Christian faith through the parish
 magazine.I visit the sick in hospital 
 or in their homes,and deal with       
 people's problems.                    
 In all this work I have many other    
 people who are ready and willing to   
 share in the work of running the      
 parishes.                             
 My job could be seen as that of a     
 shepherd looking after his flock or a 
 captain of a team.                    
                                       </content>
