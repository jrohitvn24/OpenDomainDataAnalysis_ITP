 There have been a lot of changes      
 in recent years of farming.Many sprays
 and chemicals have been introduced and
 more farmers are using them.The farms 
 have become a lot larger and also more
 specialised.Ploughing by horse,though 
 no longer used on farms,has become    
 very popular for competition.         
 Some crops grown in the area are      
 wheat,barley,potatoes,carrots,lettuce,
 cauliflower,cabbage,onions and swedes.
{Dairy Farming                     }   
 Farmers are now using bulk containers 
 instaid of kits.A recent change is the
 introduction of milk quotas by the    
 E.E.C.,controlling the amount of milk 
 produced.Clets have been developed to 
 extract the milk from the cow,which   
 makes it easier, faster and more      
 economical for the farmer.One large   
 dairy farm exists in our d-block.     </content>
