  LEISURE. Few people pursued a regular
leisure activity. About one fifth went 
to Evening Classes and a few were      
regular pub patrons. About             
three-quarters of those interviewed    
would visit theatres, concert-halls or 
restaurants occasionally.              
                                       
  PETS. Of those replying about eighty 
% kept a pet. Dogs were by far the most
popular while the miscellaneous group  
includes goldfish, rabbits, ferrets and
a tortoise. Out of 50 replies there    
were 29 dogs, 11 cats, 3 budgerigars, 6
horses and 16 miscellaneous.
