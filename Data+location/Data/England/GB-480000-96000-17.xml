		<title>17EARNLEY MILL</title>
		<content>{  Earnley Mill}is an octagonal,black  
 tarred,weather boarded smock mill.    
 They were called smock mills because  
 they looked like a farmer in a smock. 
 It's present owners,Mr.and Mrs.Darby, 
 have traced its history back to 1813. 
   In 1827 it was made higher by giving
 it a brick base and further           
 strengthened in 1913 and 1933.When    
 working it had four sails and a six   
 bladed fantail.It was the last working
 mill in Sussex,stopping work in 1946. 
 The mill worked only two pairs of     
 stones,but in 1870 a third pair was   
 added.The Stevens family owned the    
 mill for many years.They ground the   
 local corn and there was a bakery next
 to the mill.The mill was sold in 1946 
 and was used as tea rooms until the   
 present owners bought it in 1958.Today
 used as a home,the mill has no sails.
