		<title>13THE TOWN CENTRE</title>
		<content> From our questionnaire about shopping 
 habits,it would seem people don't like
 the idea of pedestrianisation because 
 many come in cars and they want to be 
 able to park anywhere.Under cover     
 shopping may confuse old people who   
 may get lost in the big shops and the 
 owners would lose profits because they
 would go to the corner shops instead. 
 Under this area of town lies Roman    
 Castleford which was called Legeolium.
 The Romans built their forts in       
 Castleford because it was the easiest 
 place to cross the River Aire.The     
 archeologists found granaries         
 workshops and barrack blocks here.    
 The Romans played draughts with flat  
 stones in the Roman baths which are   
 now covered to protect them.It is     
 hoped one day to build a museum over  
 the baths.                            
                                       </content>
