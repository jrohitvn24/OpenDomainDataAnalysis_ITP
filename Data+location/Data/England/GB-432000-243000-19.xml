		<title>19RELIGION IN TYSOE</title>
		<content> The village has two main places of    
 worship - an ancient Anglican church  
 and a modern Methodist chapel. A      
 former Plymouth Brethren meeting house
 is now disused. The village falls     
 within the Catholic parish of         
 Ilmington, the priest being Father    
 Keniry, but the few Catholic villagers
 mainly attend worship at the nearer   
 churches of Brailes, Kineton, or      
 Shipston.                             
 The large parish church dates from at 
 least the eleventh century, and has   
 some fine architectural features. The 
 Vicar is the Rev. I. Lilley, who has  
 two other parishes, but lives at      
 Tysoe. There is a church choir. The   
 chapel, replacing an older building,  
 was built in 1970, and has rooms      
 attached where a Sunday School meets. 
 The Minister is the Rev. D.F. Clarke  
 of Wesley Manse, Kineton.             </content>
