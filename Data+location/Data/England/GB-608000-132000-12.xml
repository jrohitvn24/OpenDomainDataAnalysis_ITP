		<title>12Bird Life. (Romney Marsh).</title>
		<content>    Rooks and Jackdaws, Lapwings       
 tumbling in the sky. Herring Gulls and
 Black Heads returning from the        
 foreshore. Swans on the canal. With a 
 flash of blue....a Kingfisher. The    
 intense yellow of a Yellow Wagtail,   
 the melancholy note of a Curlew as it 
 flies high overhead. A Heron          
 reluctantly rising from a dyke to     
 return to its heronry at West Hythe.  
 The warblers in the summer - Reed and 
 Sedge, Chiff-Chaff and Willow.        
 Swallows and Martins - how few there  
 have been this year, 1985. What ducks 
 are those? Mallard or Teal. Perhaps   
 the walk will be rewarded with a sight
 of a Green Sandpiper, Redshank, Snipe 
 or Rail.                              
    Not to mention many others in this 
 interesting and varied area with its  
 marsh, woods, fields, canal and even a
 Wild Life Sanctuary.                  </content>
