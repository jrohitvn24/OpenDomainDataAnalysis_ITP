		<content>{  WOODLAND}This area used to be wooded
 and over the years this has slowly    
 declined, due to farming and the      
 housing estate at Speke. The remains  
 of the woods are still visible at the 
 Damwoods, Alderwoods and Millwoods at 
 Speke.  Big Boar, Little Boars Woods, 
 the ice and old plantations at Hale.  
{GRASSLAND}The area has general open   
 farmland and the Pasture land has been
 taken over for grain and root crops   
 and there are no cattle and sheep.{   
{HEATH}Some of the heath land still    
 exists, but due to the building and   
 siting, of the Airport runway, Fire   
 Station and ancilliary building has   
 been reduced in area.                 
{MARSH }There is some marsh land which 
 is subject to tidal flow, and part of 
 this leads to the Decoy Marsh, with   
{Hale Decoy}outside the village of     
 Hale.                                 </content>
