		<title>13Horndon Methodist R.C Church</title>
		<content>  The first Methodist Chapel was built 
 in the mill ground in 1885, but in    
 1890 the present Chapel was erected in
 the High Road.  The Minister is Rev.  
 Morrell.  Next to the Chapel is a     
 thatched cottage and then the         
 Methodist Youth Hall.  At the Feast   
 and Fayre the Chapel has a Flower     
 Festival showing a different theme    
 each year.  In the hall refreshments  
 are provided and there is a display of
 art work by the children of the       
 Village School.  The Horndon Society  
 recently built the car park wall for  
 the hall.  The Roman CAtholic Church  
 is called Church of the Sacred Heart. 
 It was built in 1938 in Oxford Road on
 part of the land called The Priory to 
 replace a smaller building.  A camp   
 was run on the land earlier in the    
 century for poor boys from Bermondsey.
