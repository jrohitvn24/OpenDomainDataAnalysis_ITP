		<title>14BRANT BROUGHTON POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> I interviewed my mother about her work
 at the post office.She mainly sells   
 stamps, postal orders,premium bonds   
 and saving stamps and certificates.   
 The item she sells most of is postage 
 stamps, about Â£200 worth each week    
 mainly 1st. class. Thursday is  her   
 busiest day when old age pensions are 
 paid out .People expect her to know   
 whats happening in the village        
 especially as many posters are        
 displayed. She said she particularly  
 liked the communication with the      
 village people who are very           
 friendly.The forms people ask for the 
 most are motor vehicle and driving    
 licence application forms.The parcel  
 trade has increased over the last     
 three years.The post box is cleared   
 twice daily--11am and 4pm.She said she
 found her job very rewarding and it   
 provides a service that villages need.</content>
