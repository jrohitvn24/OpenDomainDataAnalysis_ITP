		<title>20CLUTTON CHILDREN'S CONCERNS</title>
		<content> We are very pleased because we now    
 have a BMX track where we can ride    
 our bikes in safety.                  
         {The Third World}             
 We have all been thinking about the   
 children in Ethiopia. We raised some  
 money during Christian Aid week.Lots  
 of us also sponsored one of our       
 teachers  Mr. Stock who volunteered to
 shave off his beard and raised over   
 Â£180 for the starving children. All of
 the children in class 5 and some      
 others and their mothers knitted some 
 tops and blankets to send off to them.
                                       
 The work for this Domesday Project was
 compiled by the children in class 5 at
 Clutton School.
