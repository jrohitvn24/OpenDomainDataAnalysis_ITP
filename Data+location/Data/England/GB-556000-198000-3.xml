		<content> The "village church" is{All Saints    
{Parish Church}and situated next to it 
 is the 16th century Priests House.    
 Today this is used for village        
 activities and the rector, appointed  
 in 1985, lives in a modern detached   
 house.  From our limited survey it    
 would appear the church  is not a     
 focal point for the residents, many of
 whom do not go to any church. There is
 a moderate regular attendance with    
 more on feast days. The church has a  
 Sunday School and Mothers Union.      
 Brownies, Guides, Cubs and Scouts     
 attend services there.                
{Doddinghurst Methodist Church}was     
 founded in 1972; the minister comes   
 from Brentwood, and they also have    
 visiting lay preachers. The services  
 are held in All Saints Church by      
 arrangement with the Anglicans.
