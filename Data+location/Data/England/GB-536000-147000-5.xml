		<content>   {Godstone and Crowhurst Junction    
{Railway Stations}lie on the Reading to
 Tonbridge Line. This line was opened  
 for{South Eastern Railways}in May     
 1842.                                 
   {Godstone Station}lies three miles  
 south of Godstone and gave rise to the
 small village of South Godstone. The  
 only building of significance to exist
 before the railway appeared was{Lagham
{Manor.                                
    The importance of the railway has  
 deteriorated in the last ten years as 
 most local people now own cars. It is 
 used by school children to and from   
 school and by some adults. The total  
 number of passengers seen on the      
 Redhill train,one lunchtime,was five. 
    At{Crowhurst Junction}a double line
 spur was opened in 1884 to connect    
 trains with the London to Brighton    
 Line.                                 </content>
