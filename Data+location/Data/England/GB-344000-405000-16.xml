		<content>     My name is Kerry Wilson and I am  
 10 years of age.This is a diary of a  
 typical week in my life:              
                                       
 MONDAY-After school I have a 20 minute
 private Dancing Lesson.After tea I go 
 with a friend for Drama Practice.When 
 I return home at 8p.m.I will watch    
 T.V.for an hour or so before going to 
 bed.                                  
 TUESDAY-This is my Swimming Lesson    
 day.I can swim a little but I want to 
 improve.After the lesson,at the town  
 centre pool,I often buy some chips for
 my tea.I am then allowed to play out  
 until it is time for bed.             
 WEDNESDAY-I have a piano lesson after 
 school.Then I have a quick tea because
 it is also Brownies night.I enjoy     
 Brownies but I will soon be leaving.  
 I then watch some T.V.before having   
 supper and going to bed.              </content>
