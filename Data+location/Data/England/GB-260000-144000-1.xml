		<content>      Situated on the fringes of       
 Exmoor this area lies partially within
 the parishes of Kentisbury, Combe     
 Martin and Trentishoe.                
                                       
      One "A" road and two "B" roads   
 cross a small part of it but most of  
 the area is served by a number of     
 minor roads.   Most of the roads and  
 lanes are very steep and the minor    
 roads are often of only one car width 
 with passing places.                  
                                       
                                       
      There are small wooded areas at  
 Dean and Truckham.   The pasture on   
 the farms is sufficiently good to     
 support cattle as well as sheep.
