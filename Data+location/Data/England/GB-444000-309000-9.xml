		<content> We intervied Mrs Clegg who was our    
{caretaker}and came to Stanton -Under- 
 Bardon Primary School herself.We      
 asked her some questions about how the
 school used to be.                    
  The school was built in{1909}for     
 children from{seven to fourteen years 
 of age,to give the infant children in 
 the{Church School,}which was built    
 in{1866,}more space.It is recorded in 
 the{school log book of 1902}as being  
 overcrowded and badly ventilated, with
 over one-hundred and fifty children in
 the school.                           
  The{County School}opened on 11th     
 October{1909,}with the Headmaster     
 Mr.Boswell and two teachers and       
 one-hundred and six pupils on the     
 register.The playground was split     
 up into two parts with a rail in the  
 middle to separate boys and girls.
