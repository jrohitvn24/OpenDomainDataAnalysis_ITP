 parts of the track bed are now        
 completely overgrown or(as in the case
 of the section between Haddons Farm   
 and Bridge Farm)used as farm tracks   
 and access road.Little evidence is now

 apart from odd peices of railway      
 debris such as ballast,coal and broken
 track parts which were disgarded over 
 the years.At the saw mill at Three    
 Legged Cross GR078047 two old railway 
 containers are still in use for       
 storage purposes.The line of the      
 railway is still marked by the old    
 fencing.

 increasingly more populated,leaving
