		<title>15A DAY IN THE LIFE OF...</title>
		<content>   My name is Robert William Ellison. I
 live with my family and dog called    
 Fluffy. I am 14 years old.In the      
 morning my Mum gets me up. I have a   
 wash, a cup of tea and watch T.V. Then
 I walk to catch the school bus. I go  
 to my class and talk to my friends    
 before school. I have four lessons in 
 the morning. At break I go to the tuck
 shop and buy a drink and crisps. At   
 lunchtime I go to the chippy and the  
 rec. There are four lessons after     
 lunch and then I rush to catch the    
 bus. My favourite lesson in school is 
 P.E. and I'm in the basketball team.  
 When I get home I get changed and go  
 to the Welfare Club to play pool. I   
 have a few drinks with my Dad and his 
 mates. He gets there around 8.00 as he
 works the late shift at Dawmill       
 Colliery. I go to bed at midnight and 
 fall fast asleep.                     </content>
