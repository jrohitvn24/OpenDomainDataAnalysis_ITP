		<content> This area of the city with the area to
 the north of it has been neglected for
 many years. The general shabby        
 appearance is only now being changed  
 by some redevelopment of the Union    
 Street site. The{Millbay Docks}was an 
 old{G.W.R.}Dock which belonged later  
 to the Transport Docks Board. After a 
 period of decline the dock has        
 developed a Ferry Terminal to cope    
 with Ferry traffic to France and      
 Spain. The Ferry operator is{Brittany 
{Ferries }and enormous tourist trade   
 has been generated through the Dock,  
 so that a second Roll on Roll off     
 bridge is now being built. The ferry  
 was originally started to carry       
 freight and the import / export of    
 fruit, fish, shellfish, vegetables and
 meat has increased greatly.
