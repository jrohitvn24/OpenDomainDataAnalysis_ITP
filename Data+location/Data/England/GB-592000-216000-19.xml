		<title>19ANIMALS IN LAYER MARNEY</title>
		<content> At Thoringtons Farm, Layer Marney     
 we saw a dairy herd of Friesian cows. 
 Their calves are fattened for beef    
 if they are bullocks, or put back     
 into the herd if they are heifers.    
 Milk quotas have meant that the size  
 of the herd has been reduced from     
 80 cows to only 40. Sheep have been   
 introduced in the last year because   
 of the milk quotas. Pigs are kept at  
 Park House Farm, but not by the owner.
 They are housed in a barn and fattened
 for the market. At Rockinghams Farm we
 saw spaniel puppies. These are sold as
 potential gun dogs. There are labrador
 dogs at Roundbush Farm which are used 
 as gun dogs. One of the four horses   
 kept at Thorringtons Farm is used to  
 pull a trap made by Mr K Coe using a  
 traditional design; he sometimes makes
 these for other people.
