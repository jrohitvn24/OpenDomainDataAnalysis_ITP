		<title>11Population - By Mrs Jeffery</title>
		<content> There are 286 adults and 92 children  
 living within the area of the map,    
 mostly in the village of Cheriton     
 Bishop. This only represents part of  
 the Parish of Cheriton Bishop; the    
 draft electoral roll for the whole    
 parish lists 510 adults. The          
 population is increasing as new       
 housing is erected. The local GP,     
 whose practise covers Dunsford and    
 Christow, has increased his list by   
 600 patients in the last 3 years.     
 About 23% of his patients are retired 
 (national average 18%). The midwife   
 deals with 4-5 births per annum within
 the area of the map. The newcomers are
 from all parts of Britain, especially 
 from the Midlands and the South-East. 
 They come to find work a better       
 quality of life. The native Devonians 
 are more involved in agriculture than 
 the former.                           </content>
