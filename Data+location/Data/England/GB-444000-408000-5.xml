		<title>05Farming in our area</title>
		<content>  We visited one of the{farms}in our   
 area;the one nearest to school.Mr.    
 Barlow told us that the farm was about
{250 years old.}Their family had only  
 farmed it since 1942,45 years ago.We  
 asked how farming had changed and he  
 said it was easier today but far more 
 dangerous because of the{chemicals}and
{farm machinery.}They farmed winter    
 wheat,winter barley,potatoes,grass and
 a new crop,oil_seed rape.They also had
 65 beasts and 150 pigs to fatten for  
 food.It takes three of them,all       
 brothers,to run the farm.Other farms  
 in the area have dairy cattle and one 
 farm,Limphill Farm trains race horses 
 for the national hunt.Summer and      
 Autumn are their busiest times when   
 they work long hours.The animals need 
 attention seven days a week.
