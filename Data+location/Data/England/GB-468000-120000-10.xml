		<title>10COUNTRY PARK - ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content> The Country Park hosts a number of    
 sporting activities,including hang    
 gliding, grass skiing,skiing and      
 sledging in snowy winters like that of
 1984-1985 and the annual Butser Run.  
 The competitors in this event are     
 sponsored to run (or walk) up and down
 the hill and the money raised is      
 donated to local charities.           
 A number of other events connected    
 more with its 'country'role are       
 organised each year.These include     
 Sheepdog Trials and a large Country   
 Fair held usually in July.As a number 
 of local people own just one or a few 
 sheep the Country Park also organises 
 for them some of the important        
 activities connected with the rearing 
 of sheep,such as the statuatory       
 dipping that has to be carried out,and
 shearing the sheep.
