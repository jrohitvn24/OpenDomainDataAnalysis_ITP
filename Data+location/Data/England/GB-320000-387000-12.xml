		<title>12A DAY AT PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   "At{West Kirby Primary School}the   
 whistle goes at 8.55 am. We go into   
 class and do the register. After      
 Assembly we read and do Maths, then we
 go out to play.  After English it is  
 lunchtime.  On Mondays we do P.E. then
 read until afternoon play time.  We   
 finish our work and go home at 3.30.  
 I prefer days when we play rounders   
 and do story writing, and Fridays     
 because you've got a whole free       
 weekend ahead."                       
                                       
  {"Hilbre Secondary School,}opened in 
 1966, is one the schools we may go to 
 when we are 11.  There are 860 boys   
 and girls, from 11 to 18. They study a
 lot of different subjects.  Staff     
 organise holidays abroad and trips to 
 Chester Zoo and Alton Towers.  There  
 are lots of clubs, school teams, an   
 orchestra and choir."                 </content>
