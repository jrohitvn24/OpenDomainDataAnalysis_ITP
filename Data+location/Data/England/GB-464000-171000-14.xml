		<content>    Traffic has become an increasing   
 problem in the past few years.With the
 increased numbers of people moving    
 into the ever increasing number of    
 houses,the road systems rapidly proved
 inadequate.                           
    Naturally the greatest problem was 
 the sheer volume of cars wishing to   
 leave the Calcot and Tilehurst areas  
 to get onto the M4 motorway to travel 
 either East towards London,or to the  
 West.Also large numbers wishing to    
 travel into Reading to offices,shops  
 firms and factories.                  
    The main centres of traffic        
 congestion were at junctions with the 
 A4 Bath Rd.Large roundabouts have now 
 been built and these have contributed 
 much to the improving situation.      
    However,the new 'mini-roundabouts' 
 still have to prove their worth.
