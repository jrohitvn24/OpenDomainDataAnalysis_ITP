		<content> Our school is a small school with 42  
 children aged between 4 and 11 years. 
 It has two full time teachers, Miss   
 Thorp and Mr Barraclough, the head.   
 Mrs Harris comes in for one morning a 
 week, and Mrs Clifford also comes in  
 one morning each week to work with a  
 few children. A lot of mums come to   
 school to help us with our work as    
 well.                                 
 It is an old school - no-one is sure  
 when it was built - with a new part   
 where the infants work.               
 Some children come to school in a     
 land-rover, but most walk.            
 We do all kinds of work - Maths,      
 English, Science, Music, Topic, P.E., 
 Games, R.E. and Art and Craft, but the
 best part is when we go on a field    
 study trip for a week. This year we   
 went to Sheffield.
