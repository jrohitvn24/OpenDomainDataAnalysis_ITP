		<content> HEAVY TRAFFIC                         
 People are concerned about the dangers
 to pedestrians and the damage to      
 buildings caused by heavy lorries     
 coming through our quiet villages and 
 narrow roads. Here are two examples of
 accidents involving heavy lorries:    
 about two years ago the Wonersh       
 Pepperpot was knocked down by a goods 
 lorry. The Pepperpot, with resting    
 seats, was situated in the middle of  
 the crossroads. About a year ago, a   
 lorry was travelling through Bramley  
 when a loosely tied piece of metal    
 slid off the vehicle and injured an   
 old lady. The sheet of metal then     
 passed through a shop window and could
 have harmed shoppers inside.          
 Pedestrians are particularly          
 vulnerable in Bramley as there are a  
 number of schools there and children  
 travel to and fro at peak times.      </content>
