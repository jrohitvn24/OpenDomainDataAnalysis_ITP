		<content> Braintree is an expanding town with an
 ever increasing population. The area  
 is commutable and there is a demand   
 for new and old houses in the town and
 surrounding villages. Braintree has   
 also been a popular town in the GLC   
 overspill scheme. New housing estates 
 are constantly appearing and the face 
 of Braintree has changed accordingly. 
 Many of the estates are pleasantly    
 ordered with a variety of housing and 
 trees left where possible.            
 The largest number of houses are      
 semi_detached, both private and       
 council.                              
 New shops and stores have appeared in 
 the last few years ,in line with      
 housing demands.
