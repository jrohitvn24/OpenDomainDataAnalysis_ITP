		<title>02REDEVELOPMENT OF YIEWSLEY</title>
		<content> In the past few years Yiewsley High St
 has undergone extensive redevelopment.
 The main change is the closing and    
 demolition of existing shops with     
 prestigious office blocks being built 
 in their place.Four such buildings    
 have already been completed.Much      
 office space is still available for   
 let.In fact 127,500 sq feet are still 
 available.Despite this,many shops are 
 derelict and await demolition         
 presumably to be replaced by further  
 commercial concerns.Not all of the    
 space will be used as offices some    
 will be used for trading.It is likely 
 that the office blocks are for        
 companies dealing heavily with        
 Heathrow Airport.For such companies   
 there are distinct advantages in being
 located only two miles north of       
 Britain's foremost airport.
