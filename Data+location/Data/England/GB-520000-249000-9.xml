		<title>09LANDSCAPE:SAND QUARRYING</title>
		<content> The{soil in Potton is sandy.}It has   
 been suggested that most of the sand  
 is from the Ice Age and has           
 accumulated over the years. In our    
 'block' there are{three sand quarries 
{the Eastern, Redland and Tarmac       
{companies.}Eastern's is the oldest    
 quarry in Potton. This quarry covers  
 about thirty acres and is about       
 twenty six metres deep. From it twelve
 thousand tons of sand are dug each    
 day. Over two hundred thousand tons of
 sand are extracted from the quarry    
 each year. Most of the sand goes to   
 London and is used for bricklaying and
 asphalt roofing.
