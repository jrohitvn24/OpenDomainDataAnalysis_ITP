		<title>13Bonfire Night</title>
		<content> Every year Mum,Dad and two sisters    
 go to a big bonfire in the village.My 
 Dad does not like us to have fireworks
 because he thinks that they are       
 dangerous so every year we take some  
 with us to the bonfire.We give them to
 Mr.Smales who is the farmer who builds
 the bonfire.                          
 We have to pay Â£1 to be allowed in but
 we get hot dogs,beefburgers and cups  
 of hot soup for this money.           
 Bonfire night is held every year to   
 celebrate the time that a man called  
 Guido Fawkes tried to blow up the     
 Houses of Parliament because he did   
 not like the way in which the country 
 was being governed.He was really a    
 terrorist but nobody seems to think of
 him like that any more.               
 Every year lots of people get hurt or 
 burned on November the 5th.
