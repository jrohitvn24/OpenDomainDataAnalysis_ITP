		<title>14CHILDREN IN PLYMTREE</title>
		<content> Most of the children in Plymtree go to
 the very happy, rapidly growing       
 Primary School where they are not only
 educated in the traditional sense, but
 also learn to sing, to play music, to 
 act and to join in fully with their   
 community.  They have a Sunday School 
 and a Brownie Pack, a Playgroup and a 
 Mother &amp; Toddler Group, and in the    
 Summer Holidays the Church and Chapel 
 run a Fun Club for them to learn about
 Jesus. This year they have helped the 
 School by raising money in a Fun Run; 
 the famine victims in Ethiopia by     
 helping send 6 sacks of food and toys-
 the Brownies also raised Â£47 for      
 Ethiopia by selling cups of tea for   
 10p each; and handicapped children by 
 raising over Â£25 by washing cars for  
 50p each + one group even washed an   
 aeroplane and raised Â£50...Just a few 
 things that Plymtree children do!     </content>
