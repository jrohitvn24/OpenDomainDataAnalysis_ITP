		<content>{                                      
 Mr Dack and his wife have run a       
 general stores selling many different 
 kinds of food and some stationary for 
 24 years.Their average day at the shop
 started at 7.30 a.m and finished at   
 6.00 p.m.He has recently retired,but  
 thinks there  is no need for any more 
 shops in the area.His shop was always 
 a general stores,as far as he could   
 remember.His advice to people is not  
 to open new shops,especially small    
 ones,as Norwich is becoming very full 
 of large shops such as department     
 stores like Jarrolds,Debenhams and    
 Bonds.Also hypermarkets on the        
 outskirts have attracted many         
 shoppers.                             
        Mr.Dack enjoyed his career very
 much.
