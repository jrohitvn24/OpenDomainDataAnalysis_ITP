		<title>11ARABLE FARM, EAST BARKWITH</title>
		<content>    One{arable farm,}part of which was 
 included in this block, grew crops,   
 some of which were different from the 
 other arable farms.The farm consisted 
 of two farms worked as one unit of 550
 acres. Of this, 173 acres were under  
{winter wheat,}but another 52 acres    
 were under Durom{wheat for pasta.     
{Winter barley}and{rape}covered 105    
 acres each.{Potatoes}occupied 38      
 acres, but these were special potatoes
 for crisps, and were to be picked by  
 the contractor. A further 22 acres    
 were under{peas,}not for freezing, but
 for drying to make either mushy peas, 
 to go with chips, or for animal feed. 
 No cattle are kept now, so the sheds  
 built for calf-rearing now shelter    
 machinery. Twentyfive sheep are kept, 
 mainly as a hobby, and there are five 
 geese. A reservoir built to irrigate  
 potatoes is also home for{trout.      </content>
