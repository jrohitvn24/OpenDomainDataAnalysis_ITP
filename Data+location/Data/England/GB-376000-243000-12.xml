		<title>12  A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>    My name is{Ruth Stephanie Close,}I 
 am nine years old and live with my    
 mum, dad and brother Simon who is 12. 
  Most mornings my mum goes out to work
 at 7a.m. but always brings me a cup of
 tea first.By 7.45 I am out of bed,    
 washed,dressed and down stairs for    
 breakfast,if I am not my dad gets     
 grumpy (he's a teacher by the way).   
  After breakfast I call for my friends
 and we walk to school, it's about half
 a mile.Mine is a small school which I 
 like very much.                       
  My favourite weekday is Wednesday    
 because after school I go to a lady   
 called Mary's house where I am        
 learning to spin and weave wool, we   
 are also being taught about dying wool
 and making felt.Mary teaches my mum   
 too.After this I play for a while,    
 have my tea,do my homework,watch T.V. 
 and then go to bed (as late as I can).</content>
