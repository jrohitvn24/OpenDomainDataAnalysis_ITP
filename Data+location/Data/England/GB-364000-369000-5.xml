		<title>05The Northwich Guardian</title>
		<content> The two main local newspapers are the 
 Northwich Guardian and the Northwich  
 Chronicle.Other Newspapers are the    
 World and the Advertiser,which are    
 free circulars.The Guardian is        
 published once a week and sells about 
 15000 copies.Advertising pays for most
 of the Guardian.Most adverts are by   
 estate agents selling housing.The     
 general public can advertise as well.A
 5 line advert may cost Â£2.00 but a    
 full page business advert may cost    
 thousands of pounds.                  
   The main story in the June,7th      
 edition concerned the Octel Company   
 who planned to bury 5,000 tonnes of   
 toxic lead near the village of        
 Lostock. Local opposition to the plan 
 was strong, claiming that the lead was
 a health hazard. The Octel plant is   
 due to close in June 1985 due to the  
 reduction of lead in petrol.          </content>
