		<content> Home improvements increase the value  
 of homes,save on fuel bills, but we   
 think most people also like to keep up
 with their neighbours.                
   Most of the inhabitants here are    
 working class although some of the    
 houses do indicate some people can    
 afford more stylish housing than      
 others.                               
   The planners have managed to create 
 a pleasant and varied urban area by   
 breaking up long lines of terraced    
 houses,painting brickwork different   
 colours,putting closes ,curves and    
 crescents in the street pattern.They  
 have also given some thought to       
 peoples lives ,for instance old       
 peoples flats and bungalows are handy 
 for the local shops.
