		<content> As well as removing hedges and        
 ploughing up medieval stripland, a    
 local builder has ploughed over an    
 area of badger sets.Badgers had       
 already being suffering cruelty       
 according to local newspaper reports, 
 from people taking part in badger     
 baiting.Badgers were being dug out of 
 their sets,their lower jaw being      
 broken before being set on by several 
 dogs.                                 
 Fox hunting in the area has also      
 caused some controversy with public   
 opinion divided on its merits as the  
 most efficient method of pest control,
 and cruelty to animals.It has been    
 said that if foxhunting was abolished,
 then the coverts and copses would also
 disappear as farmers would convert    
 them to farmland with tragic results  
 for wildlife.
