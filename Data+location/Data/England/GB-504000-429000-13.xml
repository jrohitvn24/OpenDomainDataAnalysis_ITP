		<title>13THE AVENUES, 2.</title>
		<content> The members look after the grass      
 verges and the{Victorian}fountains.   
 They have erected seats for people to 
 sit on while they are out walking.    
 Here and there in the area are new,   
 modern houses. Also in the area are   
 several hotels for people to stay in  
 for a short period of time. Some of   
 the houses are being converted into   
 old peoples homes.                    
   In recent years the drains have been
 dug up and replaced because they were 
 old and cracked. Also the roadshave   
 been re-surfaced and the pavements    
 repaired.
