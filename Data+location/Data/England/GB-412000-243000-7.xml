 In the summer the bullocks eat fresh  
 grass and they live in a big field and
 go into the barn in winter. The calves
 go into the barn until they are big   
 enough to go out when they are about  
 one year old. At two years old they   
 are sold to a butcher.

 There are two dogs on the farm. they  
 act as watch dogs as well as being    
 pets. The dogs help to keep away the  
 rats and rabbits.
