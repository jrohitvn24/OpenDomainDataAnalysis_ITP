		<content> Much land has been reclaimed from the 
 rough moorland. Some of these {mixed  
{hill farms}go back 250 years. Various 
 hardy breeds of sheep are kept. A     
 variety of cattle are kept mainly for 
 beef. One farm has 25,000 hens, others
 keep a few hens and pigs. Most farms  
 are run by the family.                
                                       
{Stockhouse Farm} sells frozen food,   
 stocked by their own lambs and bulk   
 purchased meat and vegetables.        
{Broadstones Farm} use some land to    
 grow vegetables to sell in their shop.
{Booth House Farm} is a small hill farm
 of 16 acres situated under Denholme
