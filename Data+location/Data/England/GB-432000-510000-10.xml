		<title>10NEASHAM VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  The village of Neasham stands on the 
 north bank of the River Tees.A        
 pleasant village green provides       
 playing facilities for children and   
 fishing is free from the river bank.  
 There is also a mediaval ford which is
 still in use today.                   
  The village hall, (known locally as  
 the Reading Room, as it was originally
 built by a local landowner in 1903 for
 men as a meeting place) is now used   
 for all village activities. The       
 residents must travel to the nearby   
 village of Hurworth for both religious
 worship and schooling.                
  As there is virtually no employment  
 in the village, workers commute to    
 Darlington, Durham and Teeside, using 
 private transport or the one hourly   
 bus service to Darlington.
