		<title>16BAGMILL FARM - TREMATON</title>
		<content> Bagmill farm is owned by the same     
 family as Cumble Tor (qv) and is the  
 two farms are run as a single entity. 
 The family of grandfather, father and 
 mother, son and two daughters work the
 farms themselves. The children        
 attended nearby Saltash schools,      
 travelling by a minibus provided by   
 the school. The eldest daughter is at 
 college in St Austell. Social         
 activities after school are often a   
 problem because of the isolation of   
 the community and the lack of         
 transport. Much of the children's     
 spare time is thus spent on the farm.
