		<content> The Atlantic Leisure Park at          
 Sandymouth is 32 years old and the    
 owners have lived there since it      
 opened in 1953.They have 142{caravans 
 and the season starts at Easter and   
 continues through to the end of       
 September.The facilities they have are
 a shop, play area, launderette,       
 solarium, discotheque,bar and a       
 gymnasium.A mixture of adults and     
 children stay there.                  
    Many tourists stay there because it
 is a beautiful area, the coast being  
 owned by the{National Trust.}Tourists 
 who stay there like it because it is  
 quiet and peaceful. People staying at 
 the Park really need their own        
 transport as the area is rather       
 isolated and is not served by any     
 public transport.
