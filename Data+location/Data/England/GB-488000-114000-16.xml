		<title>16LEISURE PURSUITS - S.DOWNS</title>
		<content>    The S.Downs is one of the best     
 areas in the S.of England for outdoor 
 exercise &amp; enjoyment. The 80 mls of   
 wide rolling downland &amp; woodland      
 attracts walkers, campers &amp; horse     
 riders, yet it is still possible to   
 walk all day without meeting anyone!  
 Bird watchers, entymologists, botan-  
 ists, archaeologists &amp; conservation-  
 ists find much of interest.           
   Many footpaths &amp; bridleways lead    
 across the Downs &amp; through the forests
 on the S.side &amp; these are popular with
 horse riders &amp; walkers. The S.Downs   
 Way is the long distance path from    
 Eastbourne to Buriton.                
    This stretch of downland is hunted 
 by the Cowdray &amp; Leconfield Hunt.     
 Shooting is managed by the Goodwood   
 Estate on the S.&amp; the Cowdray Estate  
 on the N.side of the downs. Forestry  
 marksmen also cull the herds of deer. </content>
