		<title>01CULLOMPTON INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>   Focal point of our area is          
 Cullompton(pop.c.4,500,81 census)     
 mentioned in the{Domesday Book.}It    
 developed above the flood plain of{   
 the{River Culm,}the river forming a   
 natural route between high ground.It  
 is a centre for surrounding villages  
 and farms. Police,fire services,court,
 schools,library,health centre,sports  
 hall,are all found here.A large       
 supermarket has opened and on the main
 street are family businesses and      
 inns,including an old posting inn.    
   Town life has been much altered by  
 construction of{M.5.}motorway.Tourist 
 traffic now bypasses town.Access to   
 motorway should attract new housing   
 and hopefully new industry as many old
 factories have now closed.            
   Thriving farms surround{Cullompton.}
