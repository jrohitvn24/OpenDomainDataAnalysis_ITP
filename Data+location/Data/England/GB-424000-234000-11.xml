		<title>11Vicar of the Wolfords</title>
		<content> Who is your vicar? Ask this question  
 in our towns and cities and for the   
 most part you will get blank looks or 
 be told the name of the last vicar but
 two. Ask the question in our villages 
 and most people will know who he is   
 and many will know where he lives,    
 even though that might mean a village 
 three miles away from where he serves 
 three, four or more parishes. The     
 Church is in many ways the village -  
 the source of village identity. There 
 is a strong loyalty to the Church and 
 immense good will towards the clergy. 
 Loyalty is a two way process and the  
 rural clergy find it easy to identify 
 themselves closely with the community 
 in which they serve. In the rural     
 areas the parish priest can still     
 exercise his ancient role of father in
 God to the people of God.
