		<title>14A FAMILY HOLIDAY</title>
		<content> Last year our family went on          
 holiday to Pontins at Southport.It    
 took 3-4hrs to get there.Our chalet   
 was on the fourth block.We were       
 directly below where we were last     
 year.That night we went to the        
 Crocodile Club.It was great.We also   
 watched an act by a Dutchman.He was   
 very good.The next day I went to the  
 Adventure Playground and after that I 
 went swimming.When I finished swimming
 I looked for Capt.Blood.Me and my     
 "wonderfull" brother ended up in the  
 boating lake saturated.Mum was not    
 pleased when I told her.We had to get 
 changed.At night I went to the Croc.  
 Disco and met a Scottish girl named   
 Jill Kennedy.She was really nice and  
 we now write to each other.It was a   
 self-catering holiday. Most of our    
 class stayed in England for their     
 holidays.                             </content>
