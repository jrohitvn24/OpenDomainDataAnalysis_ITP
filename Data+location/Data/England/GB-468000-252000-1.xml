		<title>01The Gayton/Tiffield Area</title>
		<content>                                       
This area is essentially a rural area. 
It contains one small community - the  
village of Gayton, a hamlet of five    
houses called Dalscote and touches upon
the edges of Tiffield and Eastcote.    
The whole area is elevated above 125   
feet and contains no substantial       
stretches of water or rivers. The small
streams are mainly drainage ditches for
the farms which dominate the area.     
Arable (essentially cereals),grazing,  
and some horse-rearing are pursued at  
these farms.                           
Overhead power-lines traverse the area 
from South-East to North-West and      
several cuttings run from North to     
South, a reminder of days gone by when 
the region was served by a substantial 
rail network.  The latter transported  
people to the Gayton Golf Course, now  
ploughed up.                           </content>
