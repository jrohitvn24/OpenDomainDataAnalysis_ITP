		<title>11A LITTLEPORT ANTIQUE SHOP</title>
		<content> The shop in{Main Street}was built on  
 one floor in about 1650 and a second  
 floor, ladder and thatched roof on    
 pitch pine beams (a local wood) was   
 added in the next century. A river    
 runs underground below the front of   
 the shop. One family owned the house  
 from 1864 to 1978. There are two empty
 cottages in the garden (rental 2      
 shillings) with thatched roofs under  
 corrugated iron.                      
                                       
 The present owner has many{artefacts  
 of the local area, including a Roman  
 coin found in Camel Road, Delft plates
 and a postcard of the 1912 fire       
 engine.                               
                                       
 The{ghost}of a lady in a long dress   
 was seen standing behind the shop     
 recently.
