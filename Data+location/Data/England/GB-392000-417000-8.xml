		<content> At 9:10am we arrived at Sladen Wood.  
 We were very excited.We were then     
 introduced to three of the firm's     
 managers.First we went to the yarn    
 store where they had{man made yarns}  
 from various European sources.There   
 were fibres such as {glass &amp; Kevlar   
 for ballistics.Then we went into the  
 twisting department.They used high    
 speed beaming machines where the yarn 
 was put on to back beams and then on  
 to weavers'beams. Then at 10:00am we  
 interviewd a worker who had been there
 a long time.After that we went to     
 Sladen Wood{weaving}shed.The looms    
 were made by RUTI.The noise was so    
 bad we had to wear ear plugs.They     
 were weaving glass and synthetic      
 fibres for making electrical          
 insulation,luggage and bullet proof   
 vests-amongst others.
