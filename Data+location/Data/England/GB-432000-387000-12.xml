		<title>12CHURCH IN SHEFFIELD</title>
		<content> I go to{Walkley Baptist Church}which  
 is in Crookes, Sheffield. The service 
 starts at 10.30am on Sunday and       
 finishes about midday. I enjoy singing
 tke hymns and choruses. There is a    
 group for young children aged 5 to 8  
 years old, they go out during the     
 sermon.                               
  {Billy Graham,}an American Christian 
 who is trying to bring people to know 
 God, has been in Sheffield recently. A
 group from our church went to hear him
 speak, I went 3 times. He was speaking
 at one of the local football grounds  
 and people who wanted to follow Jesus 
 could go on to the pitch and say so. I
 enjoyed the meetings, they were on    
 22nd to 29th June 1985.               
   I have gone to church all my life, I
 go because my whole family are        
 Christians.
