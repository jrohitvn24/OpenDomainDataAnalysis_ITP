		<title>20Employment Opportunities</title>
		<content> There is little unemployment in this  
 rural area but most people have to    
 travel to surrounding areas to work.  
 There is one small carpenters business
 in Wistow, employing 5 people and one 
 motor engineers in Great Raveley      
 employing 6 people.  The farms are    
 arable and mechanised offering little 
 employment compared to those employed 
 on the land in the past.  Five people 
 are self employed, carrying out small 
 building and repair works.
