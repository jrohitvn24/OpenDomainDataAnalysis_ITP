		<title>15RELIGION IN OFFLEY.</title>
		<content> There is a chapel in the village but  
 it is no longer in use as the few     
 people who worshipped there can no    
 longer afford its upkeep and the site 
 is likely to be put up for sale.      
   The Roman Catholics hold a monthly  
 service in the Church of England which
 is dedicated to Mary Magdalene.       
   There is no longer a Sunday School  
 in the village and few of the young   
 people go to church .                 
   The school is governed by  members  
 of the Parochial Church Council and   
 upholds the Christian Traditions and  
 beliefs as well as teaching "Religious
 Education" which includes the beliefs 
 and customs of other world religions. 
   The vicarage in Offley has been sold
 and there is no longer a Vicar of     
 Offley only a Priest in Charge.
