		<content> THE MAJORITY OF THE HOUSING IS EITHER 
 TERRACED OR SEMI DETACHED,WITH A      
 NUMBER OF NEWER DETACHED AREAS AND TWO
 SETS OF FLATS.                        
 FARM BUILDINGS ARE EVENLY SCATTERED   
 THROUGH THE AREA EXCEPT ON HIGH MOORS.
 A NUMBER OF THESE HAVE BEEN ENGULFED  
 IN URBAN AREAS. THE HOUSING HAS SPREAD
 UP FROM THE STEEL WORKS AND ALONG THE 
 MAIN ROAD. THE LAST MAJOR DEVELOPMENT 
 WAS IN THE SIXTIES, BOTH PRIVATE AND  
 PUBLIC SECTORS. OLDER AREAS ALONG THE 
 MAIN ROAD HAVE RECENTLY BEEN          
 DEMOLISHED. THERE ARE PLANS TO        
 REDEVELOP CERTAIN AREAS WHILST OTHERS 
 HAVE BEEN LANDSCAPED AND PLANTED. THE 
 HOUSES IN BOLSTERSTONE ARE MOSTLY     
 NINETEENTH CENTURY AND MADE FROM LOCAL
 STONE.
