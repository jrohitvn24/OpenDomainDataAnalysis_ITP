		<title>18HISTORY OF THE VILLAGES</title>
		<content> The village of Whixley is mentioned in
 Domesday as Qwixley and traces of a   
 Saxon church were found at the        
 Victorian restoration of the l2th C.  
 church. It was burned by the Scots    
 in the l4th C. The Bank family held   
 the manor before the Tancreds who were
 the last lords of the manor. The Roman
 road from Newton Kyme to Aldbrough    
 goes through the village and it is    
 said that the cobbles used in many of 
 the old houses were from that Roman   
 'street'. There was no church at Green
 Hammerton until Victorian times when  
 the Vicar of Whixley Rev. Valentine   
 had a small Gothic stone building made
 for the people of the village in l876.
 The Bay Horse and many houses on the  
 Green are l8th C. and it was          
 undoubtedly a coaching place on the   
 North route from York.  The Manor,now 
 gone,once was owned by the Farrers.   </content>
