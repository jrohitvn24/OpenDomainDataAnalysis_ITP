		<content> Our Parish School with two            
 classrooms,a canteen and modest       
 playground,is a powerhouse of         
 activity; our 27 pupils see to that.  
 Whether at their lessons,excursions,  
 swimming or football,all are tackled  
 with great enthusiasm.Full of energy, 
 always searching for ideas,           
 inquisitive,all natural aspirations of
 the young.Our children are also taught
 other deeper qualities of life.       
 Qualities of the whole person.Their   
 recent survey of the Village earned   
 the admiration of everybody.The       
 environment, and the encouragement    
 they have received in their formative 
 years, is a head start.Being a small  
 school was a liability where          
 beaurocracy thought we were           
 expendable.That worry of closure is   
 thankfully now behind us,we hope for  
 ever.Written by a School Governor.    </content>
