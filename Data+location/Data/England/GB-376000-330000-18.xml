In some woods the common Adder is      
often seen basking in the summer       
sunshine and cast skins are quite      
common. Small mammals such as field    
mice and voles exist in large numbers  
and there is much evidence of a large  
population of moles at work.           
Since Dutch Elm disease devastated the 
majority of Elms there has been        
extensive planting of saplings in      
hedges and fields, most of which are   
now well established. Many farms now   
have small areas which they leave      
undisturbed in order to encourage      
wildlife.                              
Insects are numerous, moths and        
butterflies are prolific and many types
of Dragon flies are resident around the
ponds.                                 
                             Continued.
