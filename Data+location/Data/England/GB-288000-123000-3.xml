		<content>   A G.W.R.branch line, Taunton-Barn-  
 staple, stopping in Brushford, closed 
 in 1966, the nearest station now being
 over 20 miles away. Somerset County   
 Council bought the disused track for a
 greenway.Farmers and householders own 
 some sections but from the church path
 to Nightcott remains a public footpath
 and bridleway with 4 access points.   
 This is maintained by the County      
 Council, and is a popular level walk  
 for Brushford people.                 
   In the 1984 drought, South West     
 Water Authority used the old track for
 an emergency pipeline for water from  
 Wimbleball Lake, via R.Exe, to be     
 pumped to join the R.Yeo, thence to   
 supply N.Devon. This will be used for 
 10 years if needed. The bed of the    
 pipeline was also used to bring mains 
 water from N.Devon to some households 
 in N.East of Brushford Parish.        </content>
