		<title>15A SCHOOLGIRL'S DAY</title>
		<content> I get up at 7 o'clock and go          
 downstairs to have breakfast, which is
 egg,bacon,fried bread and mushrooms.  
 Then I have a grapefruit. Afterwards I
 wash and dress, then take my dog,     
 Goldie, for a walk. I help my dad chop
 kindling for our fire which I light,  
 then I have a break for coffee at 10  
 o'clock, while I watch some           
 television. After lunch I help my mum 
 to wash up, then I get ready to go    
 pony riding at Keswick near Norwich. I
 get back home about 5 o'clock when I  
 have tea, take my dog for another     
 walk, watch television and go to bed. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
