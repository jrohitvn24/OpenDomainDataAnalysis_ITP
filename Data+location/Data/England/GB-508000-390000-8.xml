		<title>08FORESTRY IN MIDDLE RASEN</title>
		<content> To the north and east of Market Rasen 
 in the parish of{Middle Rasen}there is
 a large area of wooded land. The trees
 were planted by man and have not been 
 there for very long. The original     
 trees were planted just before the    
 Second World War in 1937. This is in  
 the area near Walesby Grange which now
 covers nearly 230 hectares. More trees
 were planted between 1947 and 1950.   
 Later plantations were set out at     
 Usselby and nearer to Middle Rasen    
 between 1957 and 1965. These areas    
 total nearly 90 hectares.             
  The trees which were planted are     
 mostly Corsican Pine and Scots Pine   
 but there are some Norway Spruce.     
 Around some of the plantations there  
 are Silver Birch trees.               
  At present trees are being harvested 
 in the Osgodby Moor Plantation and    
 being used for general purposes.      </content>
