		<content>    Pudsey is separated from the nearby
 urban centres of Leeds and Bradford by
 green belt.There are a few farms      
 surrounded by woodland and streams    
 which are used recreationally.A local 
 conservation corps is the watchdog of 
 the area,making sure that it is       
 well-kept.The woodland cover is mainly
 mixed deciduous,largely oak and silver
 birch.The woods are regularly coppiced
 to ensure regrowth of the natural tree
 cover and to try to contain the       
 sycamores etc. which can dominate an  
 area very easily if left to nature.   
    Nearer the town centre a disused   
 railway track has been made into a    
 nature walk by clearing land and      
 planting various trees,shrubs and     
 grasses.Many animals and birds have   
 been attracted by the renewed growth  
 and the area is now very popular with 
 local residents.                      </content>
