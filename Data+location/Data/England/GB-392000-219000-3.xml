		<title>03MANOR FARM, CHELTENHAM</title>
		<content> Up Chargrove Lane there are about     
 three or four farms.Chargrove Lane is 
 in Up Hatherley and Chargrove Lane    
 goes onto the Shurdington Road.If you 
 turn left the road goes up to Warden  
 Hill,but now we are going to tell you 
 about Manor Farm.Manor Farm is the    
 first farm that you go past when you  
 go up Chargrove Lane.The farm house   
 was built about 220 years ago.The farm
 has a lot of fields with it and in one
 of them they are doing an interesting 
 archaeological dig which they think   
 it might be an old Saxon church.There 
 is a building company who are hoping  
 to build some houses in some of the   
 fields.Already pipes are being put    
 through some fields for draining the  
 rain water from out of the ground.In  
 one of the fields there are a lot of  
 Oak trees.The Newman family have owned
 Manor Farm for many generations.      </content>
