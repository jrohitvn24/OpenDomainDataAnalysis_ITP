		<title>15The Helicopter Service.</title>
		<content> The helicopter landing area is in the 
 north of this block and to the west of
 the village.Castle Air Charters of    
 Liskeard run the service(by contract  
 with the Landmark Trust).The flying   
 time from Liskeard is 25 minutes.     
 They use 3 types of craft:Agusta Bell 
 Jet Ranger,Long Ranger and 109 (a twin
 engined craft).4 or 7 can be carried  
 depending on type.From Hartland Point 
 to Lundy takes about 7 minutes.We went
 over in a 4 seater and came back in a 
 7 seater-the 7 seater was slightly    
 faster.                               
 The charge is the same for adults and 
 children-but it is an expensive       
 service to run and the Landmark Trust 
 make no profit out of it. It runs     
 every Saturday during the season and  
 continues as long as numbers justify  
 it.All bookings should be made through
 the Landmark Trust. {Alistair Day.    </content>
