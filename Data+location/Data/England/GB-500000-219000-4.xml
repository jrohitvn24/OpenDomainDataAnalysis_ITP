		<content> B.T.R. is a rubber company in         
 Dunstable built between 1938 and 1940.
   between thirty five and thirty eight
 years ago the products changed from   
 making most rubber products to just   
 car parts.                            
   Work was done by heavy  labour.     
 Nowadays B.T.R. is automated. Heating 
 methods have changed from steam to    
 electricity to oil. The breaks have   
 changed today a rotating shift system 
 operates. Workers came from  local    
 areas but now they come from places   
 like Kettering and Milton Keynes.     
   During the war people started       
 younger than today  and were payed    
 less. There  are longer holidays now  
 but the retirement age is the same.   
 During the war more women worked there
 but now the split is about even.      
 B.T.R. has indeed changed a lot       
                                       </content>
