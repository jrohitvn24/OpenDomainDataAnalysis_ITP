		<title>02HITCHIN MARKET (1)</title>
		<content>   Hitchin Market, in its present form,
 has been established for at least ten 
 years.Earliest records date from the  
 thirteenth century.At this time it was
 a collection of moveable stalls for   
 the buying and selling of perishable  
 goods.Gradually the stalls became     
 fixed and gave way to small shops     
 between Bucklersbury and Sun          
 Street,the market becoming established
 in the open area, still known as      
 Market Place, near the streets. In    
 1794 The Universal British Directory  
 states that Hitchin Corn Market was   
 particularly noted for the quality and
 quantity of its wheat. By 1813 the    
 most important aspect was the plait   
 market, which supplied the Luton hat  
 industries. In 1939 the market moved  
 from Market Place to St. Mary's       
 Square.
