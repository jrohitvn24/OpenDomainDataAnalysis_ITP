		<content>   The land is owned by the M.O.D and  
 is used by all units of the Regular   
 Army on weekdays and by part-time and 
 volunteer forces at the weekend. The  
 normal times of use are 08.00 to 17.30
 including two late nights of up to    
 23.30. All types of personal weapons  
 are fired ranging from small-bore     
 rifles to handheld mortars. At regular
 intervals during the year the firing  
 ranges are used for prestigious       
 International events and for National 
 Championships.                        
   The Wyke Common towards the centre  
 of the area is generally used for tank
 training although no weapons are      
 fired. Manoeuvres of up to two weeks  
 in duration and involving all branches
 of the Army are also carried out in   
 this area. This however is fairly     
 occasional use and the wildlife       
 remains fairly undisturbed.           </content>
