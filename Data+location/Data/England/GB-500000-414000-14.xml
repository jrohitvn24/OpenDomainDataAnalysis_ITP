		<content>   Here you can see the long winding   
 main street of Bonby village typical  
 of several Danish named settlements   
 along the Ancholme valley sheltered   
 from the North and East by the wolds. 
 On either side we have a village      
 Hall,a Post Office,a public house,two 
 farms and a chapel.                   
   The chapel was built in 1913 and is 
 still used although it only has a     
 congregation of about six people.Lots 
 of people come on special occasions   
 like Christmas,Harvest Festival and   
 the Silver Jubilee of the crowning of 
 the Queen.                            
   One farm is a chicken farm and is   
 owned by Mr.E.Ellis.The other is a    
 cattle farm and belongs to Mr T. and  
 Mr N. Smith.On the farm there are     
 about two hundred cows.Opposite the   
 Church we have another shop called the
 General Stores.                       </content>
