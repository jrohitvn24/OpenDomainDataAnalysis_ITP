       A BRIEF DESCRIPTION             
                                       
                                       
  The church has stained glass windows.
Each window tells a story.             
  The walls are made of flint.         
  The tower fell down in 1860.A man    
called Stiff saw it fall,but did not   
tell anybody because he thought they   
would say that he had done it.         
  When you come through the front      
(south) door,you see more doors        
straight ahead in the opposite wall.   
  They put doors there because they    
believed the devil could only walk in  
straight lines,so if he came in through
one door,he would go straight out of   
the other.
