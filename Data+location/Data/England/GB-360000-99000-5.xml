		<content> Up until the time of writing this     
 village was owned by Winchester       
 College. They are now in the process  
 of selling it all so there have been  
 and will be great changes taking place
 over the next few years.  Up Sydling  
 farm, Ham Farm, Lamperts Farm part of 
 Court Farm and Sherrings Farm have all
 changed hands and new farmers have    
 taken over. Huish Farm is the only one
 left unaltered.                       
 Old barns that still belong to        
 Winchester College are being sold one 
 by one to outside developers and each 
 planning application is fiercely      
 contended by the Parish Council.      
 Winchester College after years of     
 uninterested neglect have suddenly    
 realized what a little gold mine this 
 beautiful valley is.
