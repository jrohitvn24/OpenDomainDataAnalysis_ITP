		<title>03THE VILLAGE SHOP</title>
		<content>  Mace is a food store in Dartington.  
 It gets lots of customers.It is pretty
 big and it sells a big variety of food
 such as flour, cereal,dairy products, 
 snacks and drinks.It has a post office
 It advertises things in the window and
 has good displays. There is a house on
 top.It is opposite the school so it   
 gets lots of people from the school.  
  It opens at 8.30 and  closes at 5.30.
 It is owned by Mr. Guy,that is why it 
 is some times called  Guy's.Some times
 there are long queues.I think Guy's   
 shop is important because there are no
 other good food stores in Dartington. 
 If Guy's shop closed down people would
 have to go to town and thats a bit of 
 a hassle.The people at Guy's are      
 friendly (in my opinion.) I think it's
 handy because it's just over the road 
 from our school so the teachers can   
 nip over for snacks.                  </content>
