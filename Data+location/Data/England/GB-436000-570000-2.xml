		<content>Problem to be solved:                  
IN A COASTAL AREA WITH A HIGH          
POPULATION DENSITY IS IT TRUE TO SAY   
THERE IS A PATTERN OF LAND USE LIKE THE
ONE SUGGESTED BELOW?                   
Tourist functions along the coast,old  
terraced residential area behind,      
then the main street and then          
further inland,the main residential    
area(detached and semi-detached).      
Two or three people were allocated to  
each of the 12 land areas.As the       
amenities were surveyed their numerical
value was entered on a 1:2500 map.We   
reached our areas in the school        
minibus.During lessons these values    
were totalled and transferred to a     
master map.                            
Conclusion to Problem:                 
There is no pattern like the one       
suggested above,in our area.It was     
mainly housing.                        </content>
