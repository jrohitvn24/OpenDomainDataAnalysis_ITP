		<content>    {Mousehole Association Football    
{Club}was started in 1922 by a group of
 local boys.  During this time it has  
 played on three pitches which have all
 had to be some distance from the      
 village because there is no flat land 
 large enough close to the village.    
 Since 1962 their pitch has been at    
{Trungle Moor, Paul,}on some reclaimed 
 land.                                 
     The Club has run up to five teams 
 and this means that a lot of money has
 to be raised to support them.  At one 
 time nearly everone in the village    
 went to the matches and the teams were
 selected from mainly local men.  Now  
 many of the players come from the     
 surrounding districts and only the    
 'faithful few' follow the fortunes of 
 the teams and work hard to keep the   
 club going.  One of the main sources  
 of money raising is the{Carnival Week.</content>
