		<title>13BEAK HILLS FARM</title>
		<content> Beak Hills in square 7 is a small     
 mixed farm where sheep and beef cattle
 are raised. The tenant farmer is the  
 huntsman employed by the Bilsdale     
 Hunt. George Cook and his wife Mary   
 kennel the fox hounds totalling 17.5  
 couples and 5 couples of pups. Bitch  
 hounds are whelped at the farm and    
 puppies sent to be walked by Hunt     
 members. They come back to Beak Hills 
 in September of their first year.     
 Hunting starts over a large area in   
 October and ends in May. The Hunt is  
 run by a committee and meets on       
 Tuesdays and Saturdays at 11 am during
 the season. Money is raised during the
 year with domino drives, sponsored    
 rides, a hunter trial, show jumping   
 event and gymkhana. Each rider also   
 pays an annual subscription. A farmer 
 whose land is in the area used for fox
 hunting would pay less.               </content>
