		<title>08SAVE BLEASDALE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In February 1984 Lancs. Education     
 Sub-Committee proposed to close six   
 schools in Wyre District. Bleasdale   
 C.of E. was one of them.              
                                       
 Immediately an Action Committee was   
 formed consisting of parents,         
 governors, friends and teachers to    
 present a case for the retention of   
 the school.                           
                                       
 The main argument against closure was 
 concern for childrens safety and      
 welfare when travelling great         
 distances to other schools            
 particularly in bad weather.          
                                       
 We were very pleased that our campaign
 was successful and the Education      
 Committee decided to proceed no       
 further.                              
                                       </content>
