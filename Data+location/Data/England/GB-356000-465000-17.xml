		<content>Lunesdale Court,called"The Hostel"by   
locals and built by Lancashire C.C.    
about 1864 at the southern end of Horn-
by operated as a workhouse until 1935. 
Lunesdale Rural District Council bought
it in 1938 to convert into houses.In-  
stead during the war it housed 20 eva- 
cuee children and a WVS clothing depot.
When Lunesdale R.D.C.offices in Hornby 
Hall were burned down in 1946 the coun-
cil took over part of the building and 
the remainder in 1950 when the children
left.In 1974,with local government re- 
organisation Lancaster City Coucil took
over the R.D.C.and Lunesdale Publishing
Group and Constuction Press occupied   
the building to 1982.It was bought by a
building group and converted into 16x2,
3 and 4 bedroomed houses and flats.Two 
converted farm buildings of the former 
Butt Yeats Farm and a row of 1950's    
council houses mark the village end.   </content>
