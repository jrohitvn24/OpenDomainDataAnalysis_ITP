		<title>02Trewithen Home Farm</title>
		<content>   The Trewithen Estate employs a farm 
 manager to look after its farms in    
 this area.It is a difficult job       
 because the people that they grow the 
 crops for often change their minds    
 about what they want.It is quite an   
 expensive job also,for it costs about 
 Â£500,000 per year to keep the farms   
 running.There are 400 cows(fresian)   
 and 250 young cows.                   
   Cereal production is also quite     
 high                                  
 for there are 500 acres of barley,160 
 acres of oil seed rape,453 acres of   
 wheat and 111 acres of peas.All       
 together there are 1900 acres  owned  
 by the Trewithen Home where the farm  
 manager works.One of the farms owned  
 by Trewithen Estate is Golden farm on 
 an ancient site.It has 50 cows and    
 they produce 2500 litres of milk per  
 day at the Dairy .                    </content>
