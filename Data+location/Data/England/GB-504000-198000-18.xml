		<content>{KITCHEN STAFF} Some of the kitchen    
 staff were interviewed by first year  
 pupils. There are twelve cooks and    
 they each take turns doing different  
 jobs - cakes one week, washing-up the 
 next etc. It takes three and a half   
 hours to prepare the school dinners.  
 Recently, a new self-service cafeteria
 system was introduced. The cooks felt 
 it was a much better and quicker      
 system. It means the pupils have a    
 wider choice of food and do not have  
 to queue for so long.                 
   The head cook has been at the school
 for six years, most of the others for 
 only one year. They work from 8.30a.m.
 to 3p.m. and daily takings average    
 Â£150, each pupil paying 65p for a     
 meal. As the school is in an isolated 
 position with no shops nearby, most of
 the pupils eat school dinners -       
 especially in the winter.             </content>
