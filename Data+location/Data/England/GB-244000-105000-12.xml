		<content> The Rector holds services in the      
 church on Sundays. He also prays there
 on his own every day. The regular     
 church service is called Holy         
 Communion. He also arranges services  
 for baptism,marriage and burial. He is
 responsible for the parishes of Black 
 Torrington, Bradford, Thornbury,      
 Highampton and Cookbury. He holds     
 services in each parish church in turn
 but lives in the rectory at Black     
 Torrington. He does things outside the
 church like visiting sick or elderly  
 people who have no-one looking after  
 them. He goes to nursing homes and    
 hospitals, writes sermons, attends    
 meetings and helps people in trouble. 
 He is the chairman of the school      
 governors and administers charities.  
 He comes to our school every Tuesday  
 to take a morning service, then he    
 talks about Jesus or the Bible.       </content>
