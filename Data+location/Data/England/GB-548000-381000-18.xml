		<title>18Sutton in 100 Years.</title>
		<content> I think that Sutton will be run by a  
 massive computer in one hundred years'
 time and the country will be          
 computerised. I think that instead of 
 teachers there will be a computer     
 teacher and you can only hear his     
 voice.I think we will have            
 computerised doctors.There is also the
 possibility that people could be      
 living on the moon.People from other  
 planets could land{-Dawn Hutchinson.  
 In 100 years I think Sutton will be   
 smaller.The coastline will have       
 changed.The shops will be run by      
 robots.We will wear different         
 clothes.I think we might have space   
 stations in Sutton.We will probably   
 have bigger and better rockets and    
 schools may be run by computers.The   
 cars will be different and may run on 
 orange juice or something other than  
 petrol{-Emma Briggs.                  </content>
