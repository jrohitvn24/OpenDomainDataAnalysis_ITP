		<title>11H/MERSEY CONSERVATION AREA</title>
		<content> Most of the 86 houses were built in   
 the 19th century to house people from 
 the nearby Bleach works by the River  
 Mersey.                               
  By the early 1970's the area was in  
 parts in a state of disrepair.Plans   
 were being made which could have      
 partially destroyed the buildings and 
 roads.                                
  However, a scheme involving the local
 Authority, the Goverment and          
 Unemployed people in the Community    
 Enterprise Programme produced a       
 dramatic improvment.                  
  Only Â£40,000 was provided in 1982 for
 the scheme but by reusing old setts   
 and other materials the cost was kept 
 down.New skills were learnt by the    
 workers and now almost complete,the   
 area is a fine example of             
 Conservation.
