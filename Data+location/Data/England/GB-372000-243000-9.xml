		<title>09FOOT PATHS</title>
		<content>   In the old days there were no roads,
 there were only foot paths.If a farmer
 wanted to go to another farmer he had 
 to use the{foot paths}.Little land was
 cultiveted,forests and swamps held    
 wild beasts including wild wolves and 
 wild boar.There were{bridle paths}as  
 well so that those fortunate enough to
 own a horse could ride on them.Cart   
 tracks in those days would have seemed
 like our{motorways.}                  
   Our Domesday block is blesed with a 
 very large number of foot paths and   
 bridle paths which are used purely for
 recreational purposes,walking and     
 riding.
