 animals apart from a guard dog.He     
 grows 5 crops on a 4-year rotation:-  
 wheat/wheat/early potatoes/cauliflower

 cutting after Christmas.The early     
 potatoes and cauliflowers  are sent to
 London to be sold whilst the late     
 crops are packed and sold locally.    
 People from the nearby estate have    
 been known to steal or vandalise      
 certain crops.The farms employ 25     
 people full time and up to 100 part   
 time at harvest time.Some of the farm 
 buildings are very old especially the 
 tithe barn which is the largest in    
 Kent.                                 </content>
