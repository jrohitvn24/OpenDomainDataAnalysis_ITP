		<title>15TRADITIONAL COUNTRY SPORTS</title>
		<content> The three traditional country sports  
 are still much practiced here. This is
 the "Saturday area" of the Beaufort   
{Fox Hunt},&amp; horse &amp; hound are         
 familiar, though not always welcomed  
 by all.Hunt fields of over 100 mounted
 followers &amp; dozens of spectators in   
 cars block the lanes. Several members 
 of the Royalfamily,living nearby,hunt 
 with the Beaufort and can enjoy their 
 sport without undue pressure from the 
 public.  Nowadays,noisy and sometimes 
 violent demonstrations by Anti_hunt   
 Saboteurs disrupt the day's           
 proceedings.                          
    Many farmers rear Pheasants and    
{shooting}parties are regular features 
 of the winter sporting scene.         
    The river Avon at Pinkney Park     
 provides good{fishing}for trout for   
 the owners,and private fishing is     
 available down stream at Easton Grey. </content>
