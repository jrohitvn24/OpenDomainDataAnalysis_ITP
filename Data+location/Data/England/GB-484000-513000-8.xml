 There is no doctor or surgery in the  
 village,but there is a Group Practice 
 and surgery at Sandsend about one mile
 distant.If the patient is too ill to  
 attend the surgery, home visits can be
 arranged.If a patient needs further   
 investigation he can be referred to a 
 consultant at Whitby hospital or at   
 the area hospital at Scarborough.More 
 specialised cases are referred        
 to Hull, Leeds, Middlesbrough or      
 Newcastle.Transportation of visiting  
 relatives is an immense problem and   
 causes much individual hardship.      
 Also operating in the district is the 
 Community Health Service based at     
 Whitby Hospital.This service looks    
 after the needs of the school         
 children,as well as pre and post natal
 care. It runs parallel to the service 
 provided by the doctors..             </content>
