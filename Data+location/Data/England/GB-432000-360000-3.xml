		<content> This is a pleasant, rolling country-  
 side of hill and valley,falling away  
 each side of a ridge plateau.Tree     
 cover is mainly deciduous trees and   
 scrub intermingled with a few stands  
 of conifers.There are Ashover grit-   
 stone outcrops in places like Cocking 
 Tor,and exposed faces where rock was  
 quarried.The derelict mine sites show 
 a wealth of flowers and grasses.We saw
 harebells,poppies,reedmace, and       
 meadowsweet that filled the air with  
 a scent like new-mown hay.Birds were  
 busy in the quiet lanes and           
 woods,thrushes,jays and collared      
 doves,but three kestrels hovered on   
 the uplands watching the field mice   
 foraging amongst the grasses,and there
 was a rank smell of fox behind the    
 bushes,showing the other side of the  
 quietness and peace.
