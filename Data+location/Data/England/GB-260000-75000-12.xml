		<content> This area is typical moorland with    
 lots of different plants including    
 Purple Moor Grass, Fescue, Bog Moss,  
 Bell Heather and individual Rowan     
 (Mountain Ash) trees.                 
                                       
 The grasses are the more dominant     
 plant. Bog Moss is usually found in   
 the marshy areas. There is also some  
 Gorse growing as well as Tormentil and
 Creeping Bedstraw.                    
                                       
 In some places there are coniferous   
 forests which have been planted by the
 Forestry Commission and other private 
 bodies for timber, as, for example, at
 Beardown Hill Plantation.             
                                       
 Around the valleys and farms there are
 some deciduous trees like Beech,      
 Hawthorn, Alder and Blackthorn.
