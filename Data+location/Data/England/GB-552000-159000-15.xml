   On Tuesday we went to the Bookshop  
to ask the Manageress some questions   
and this is what we found out. The shop
was once a cottage and is over 350     
years old. Each year they sell about   
100 books, most in December. New books 
are bought from publishers or          
wholesalers. There are over 6000 books 
in stock, the most expensive costing   
#60. They employ three people and open 
shop hours each week. They have 800    
children's books in stock. They sell   
mostly non-fiction books. They are     
least busy in February. About 10 people
order books each week. Several times   
there have been shoplifters but the    
shop has not, so far, been broken into.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
