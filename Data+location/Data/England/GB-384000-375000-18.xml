		<title>18THE GAMES WE PLAY</title>
		<content> Tickey scarecrow is a game. You can   
 play it with as many people as you    
 like. The object of the game is you   
 have somebody who is on. Then when    
 they tick you, you have to stand with 
 your hands and legs apart. Then       
 another person comes and crawls       
 through your legs.If the person who's 
 on sees you he or she will come and   
 tick you, but if you stay between     
 their legs they cannot tick you.      
                                       
 Tickey Chain: You choose who will be  
 on and you give everyone else a count 
 of ten to get away.The one who is on  
 has to chase and tick the others.When 
 they are ticked they all join hands   
 and chase everyone else.When everybody
 is caught someone else is on for the  
 next game.
