		<content> I am very interested in gym club.There
 are two gym clubs Broadwindsor and    
 Beaminster. At Broadwinser we have    
 floor and vault work. We have got a   
 spring board and it goes up by the    
 vault, which is when you jump on to   
 the spring board and put your hands   
 on the vault and jump over the vault  
 then try to land on your feet. These  
 are some of the vaults l do, through  
 vault, straddle vault, hand spring,   
 headspring and neck spring. On the    
 floor I do lots of moves like rolls   
 walkovers etc. Gym is fun and it makes
 you work very hard.At Beaminster Ihave
 four piece which is beam,bar, floor   
 and vault.Beam I do balances,splits   
 etc.On the bar I do up starts,swings  
 to the bar etc.Floor and vault Iv,e   
 already explained but I do much harder
 moves on the floor.
