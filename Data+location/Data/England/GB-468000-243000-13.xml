The group meets on three mornings a    
week in the village hall. In July 1985 
there were twenty-five children on roll
with three regular helpers. Two mothers
also help from time to time. The       
group's only income is from fund-      
raising and a daily charge of 75p per  
child.  When we  visited the group     
they had just been out to see a local  
farm.  Sixty-two of the one hundred    
and four children now at the village   
school attended the play group when    
they were younger.
