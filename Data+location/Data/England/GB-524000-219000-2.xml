		<content> My Mum is the first one up at about   
 7.30 a.m. because it takes her half an
 hour to get to work in Luton.  After  
 dressing and washing she goes         
 downstairs and makes breakfast of     
 cornflakes, toast and marmalade and   
 tea.  Dad is up last and after        
 showering he comes down to breakfast  
 before leaving for work at British    
 Aerospace in Stevenage.  I run to     
 school with my sister. At twelve      
 o'clock the bell rings and we go out  
 to play football while waiting for    
 lunch.  After school I run home and   
 get changed to play out with my       
 friends, or sometimes I go to the     
 Stevenage Leisure Centre to play      
 badminton. When I get home I have tea,
 which is chips and something and then 
 watch television until about 8.3O when
 I go up to bed.  I usually read a     
 while before I go to sleep.           </content>
