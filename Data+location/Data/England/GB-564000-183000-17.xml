		<title>17New Roads-Horndon-on-Hill</title>
		<content>  The B.1007 was opened in October 1984
 from the Stanford interchange.  Its   
 purpose is to allow traffic to bypass 
 Horndon.  The previous road into      
 Horndon from the old A.13 was blocked 
 off at Rookery Corner and the new A.13
 cuts across it.  The Orsett Road and  
 the B.1007 are now the two main exits 
 from Horndon.  A new bridge has been  
 built at Rookery Corner to carry      
 pedestrians over the new A.13.  The   
 section of the new A.13 from Orset    
 Cock roundabout to Stanford-le-Hope   
 interchange was opened on June 28th,  
 three months early.  Horndon will now 
 have less traffic coming though from  
 Orset to Basildon to avoid the        
 bottlenecks on the old A.13.  The     
 people who live in Horndon will find  
 life much quieter and more pleasant.
