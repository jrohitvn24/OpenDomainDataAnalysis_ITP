		<content>Because of the treacherous and unstable
local sandbanks this part of the coast 
has an infamous reputation amongst     
seamen. There have been innumerable    
wrecks on Corton beach over the years, 
one of the earliest, the Sainte marie  
in 1369, being despoiled by men from   
the village. In the 19th century a     
lifeboat and rocket (breeches buoy)    
crew were established here to aid      
stranded ships.The rocket shed still   
survives as the garage of 24a The      
Street.Corton also had its own beach   
company,an association of men who      
salvaged wrecks and their contents for 
the prize money.
