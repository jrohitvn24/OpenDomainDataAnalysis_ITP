		<content> Moreton is situated in the extreme    
 N.E.of Gloucestershire. The Four      
 Shires Boundary Stone is 3 km away.   
 Although Moreton has grown during the 
 last 30 years because a number of     
 housing estates have been built, it is
 still a village.The village centre and
 the Fire College occupy 4 sq.km. of   
 the block,the rest being agricultural.
 The{population}in 1981 was 2500. The  
 tree-lined High Street was once the   
 Roman road,the Fosse Way. Occasionally
 excessive water from Bourton-on-the-  
 Hill caused{flooding.}Recently the    
 drainage systems have been improved.  
 Moreton still has a{Railway Station   
 thanks to the efforts of The Cotswold 
 Line Promotion Group, who have opposed
 attempts by British Rail to close the 
 line. The line goes west to Worcester 
 and east, via Oxford, to Paddington,  
 London, all trains stop at Moreton.   </content>
