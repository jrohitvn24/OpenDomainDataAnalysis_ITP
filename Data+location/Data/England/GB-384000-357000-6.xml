		<title>06Buildings of Mow Cop.</title>
		<content>  On the upper parts of Mow Cop all    
around the, summit, there is a large   
village with a population of several   
thousand. The border between           
Staffordshire and Cheshire runs        
through the centre of the village.     
  The Staffordshire part of Mow Cop    
has grown gradually from the 13th or   
14th century, with houses being built  
in an  uncontrolled way.This has lead  
to a sprawling village with old stone  
cottages,between which have been built 
modern brick houses.The only large     
scale recent building is a council     
estate of 56 houses built by Newcastle 
council after the second world war.Most
of the houses on the Cheshire side were
built on a rectangular pattern.Most of 
these are terraced cottages and have   
more in common with the miners villages
at the foot of Mow Cop than with the   
buildings on the Staffordshire side.   </content>
