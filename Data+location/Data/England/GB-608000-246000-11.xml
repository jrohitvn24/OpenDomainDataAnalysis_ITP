		<title>11LIFE AT BRAMFORD HALL</title>
		<content>  I get up in the morning at about     
9:15am and draw the curtains,to see    
the sun shining through the branches   
of the trees and the dew on the grass  
glistening.For breakfast I have cereal 
(coco pops) and then a slice of warm   
toast spread thickly with margarine.   
After breakfast we nearly always go    
out.Sometimes dancing,sometimes        
shopping,and sometimes to visit people.
  When we come home we have dinner.    
Sometimes it is sausage and chips.     
Dinner is usually at 1:OOpm.After      
dinner I go out in the woods.I play on 
our tyre swing.Not far from the house  
is a very old tree,it is an evergreen  
oak.It is a super tree for climbing.I  
quite often sit up the tree and listen 
to the birds singing.I have a tree den.
It has several sections.One part is    
very cosy.                             
                                       </content>
