		<title>03Coal Mining</title>
		<content> There has been coalmining at Heather  
 for many years.  It is thought that   
 people mined coal as far back as the  
 fourteenth century.  These mines were 
 usually deep, and had shafts and      
 tunnels.  Today coal is mined at      
 Heather in a different way because we 
 have an opencast mine.  We visited the
 opencast site and we collected lots of
 information about the way coal is     
 mined today.   Today they mine twenty 
 thousand tons a week, but in the      
 recent miners' strike they actually   
 mined more than this.  The mine was   
 not on strike at this time.  The      
 deepest hole they have dug from for   
 coal is 100 metres deep.  A lot of the
 people working at the mine work for   
 private contractors who do a lot of   
 the work.  They have two very big     
 draglines.                            
                                       </content>
