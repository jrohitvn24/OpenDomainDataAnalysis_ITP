		<title>10Interviewing Mr.Daniels</title>
		<content> We interviewed {Mr. Daniels,}he was a 
 farm_worker for{TRAFFORD ESTATES.     
  His farm consists of 3000 acres.     
 He lives in {FRETTENHAM.}His only     
 dislike is there are too many         
 foreigners in Coltishall.He likes the 
 abundance of wildlife in the district.
 His views on the{R.A.F. COLTISHALL    
{AIRBASE}are that he has got used to   
 it,so he doesn't mind. When the idea  
 of an airbase was first mentioned     
 there was quite a lot of opposition.  
 But now, with the airbase well        
 established                           
 the people who live in Coltishall and 
 Horstead are quite used to it. Mr.    
 Daniels also said that he didn't like 
 the city and that he went there only  
 when he had to, preferring to shop    
 either locally (with poor choice), or 
 in one of the larger villages or towns
 nearby.                               </content>
