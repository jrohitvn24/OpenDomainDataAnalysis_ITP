		<content>  Farmers are increasingly using       
{chemicals}to assist them in their work
 to produce more corn. As soon as      
 harvest is over the land is prepared  
 for the next crop, this includes      
{spraying weed killer.}At various times
 in it's growth the crop may be        
 attacked by{insects}so it is regularly
 sprayed. Sometimes there is a risk of 
{mildew}or{fungus}so the crop is       
 sprayed again. The fields are crossed 
 with{'tram lines'}- tracks through the
 corn where the tractors regularly go. 
 Chemical{fertilizers}are used to      
 increase the yield and there is even a
 spray to regulate stalk growth. If    
 vehicles would spoil the crop then    
{aeroplanes}are used to spray from the 
 air. All these chemicals produce      
 greater yields but people are worried 
 about the effects on{public health.   
{Nitrate}levels in water are too high. </content>
