		<title>15THE COTSWOLD HUNT</title>
		<content> Mr Unwin is the master of the hunt and
 he lives in Coberley. The Cotswold    
 hunt comes round this area. The       
 Cotswold hunt was started in 1858.We  
 saw the hounds they were very big and 
 they licked my hand. There were about 
 55 couples and about 110 altogether.  
 The kennels used to be in Cheltenham  
 in Waddon road. When the hounds wag   
 their tails it is called waving their 
 sterns. Foxes tails are called        
 brushes. We saw the place where the   
 frozen meat that the hounds eat was   
 kept. It was a very smelly place beca-
 se dead sheep were strung up all over 
 the place and there were two big deep 
 freezes. We looked into one of them,  
 inside there were piles of dead sheep.
 They had no skin and they looked horr-
 id. Then we went to see the puppies   
 they were cute they were chewing their
 ears we went back to school.          </content>
