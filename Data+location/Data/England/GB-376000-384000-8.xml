		<title>08SHOPPING IN HALE BARNS.</title>
		<content>   The second major shopping district  
 in this Survey area is that centred   
 around a precinct in Hale Barns. This 
 is a popular area with shoppers and   
 businesspeople coming from as far     
 afield as Lymm and Wilmslow. The      
 precinct boasts excellent car parking,
 toilets, flower beds and seats; it is 
 generally litter free. There is,      
 however, only a small range of shops  
 thus busy mothers and older people    
 have to traval afar to complete a     
 weeks shopping. The one bus service is
 insufficient for demend and private   
 transport has to be relied upon. This 
 is a wealthy and peaceful area with   
 few facilities for young people apart 
 from one youth club. It was agreed    
 that Hale Barns is primarily a        
 residential area and that there would 
 be nothing to be gained from promoting
 the shopping area as it exists today. </content>
