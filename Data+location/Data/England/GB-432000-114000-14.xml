{in the Domesday Book.} Could it have  
 been the site of the present church?. 
 The vestry of the present{Church of St
{Boniface} is known to have been built 
 in 1240.The porch area was built in   
 the 1300 together with the rough hewn 
 ladder to the belfry. Today the belfry
 is reached by a modern ladder placed  
 aganist the old one.Large oak beams   
 support the roof of the Nave and stone
 brackets which supported the rood _   
 beam are still visible on either side 
 of the chancel arch.A beam inscribed  
 with the name of the church wardens of
 1675 is now set in the south wall.{   
{The vestry monument in the West wall  
{is to Sir Richard Mill 1613 and his   
{wife Mary.1622.}They lived at Grove   
 Place now a school.Some original      
 14thC. stone floor tiles are now set  
 into the North Wall of the vestry.    </content>
