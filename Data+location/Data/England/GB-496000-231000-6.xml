		<content> There are two public houses in the    
 village whereas there were originally 
 seven. Other activities include a     
 branch of the Royal British Legion,   
 Bowls Club, Women's Institute and a   
 cricket club using the well maintained
 ground near to the church. This ground
 stands on the site of the former      
 manor. Adjacent is Eversholt Swimming 
 Pool, now heated, an unusual facility 
 for a small village. It is remembered 
 by many who used it in its unheated   
 days with awe!                        
                                       
 There is a Mother and Toddler Club and
 the Triple Club, a meeting place for  
 the elderly from Eversholt, Tingrith  
 and Milton Bryan.
