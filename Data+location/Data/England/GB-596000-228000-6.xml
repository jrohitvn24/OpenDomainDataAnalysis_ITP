		<content>     SHOPPING ON SATURDAY              
                                       
    ON SATURDAY MORNING I GO WITH MY   
 MOTHER TO THE FARM SHOP.   WE GO IN   
 THE CAR AND PARK OUTSIDE THE SHOP IN  
 THE  DRIVE.   THE SHOP IS LIKE A      
 GARAGE WITH ROWS OF SHELVES MADE OUT  
 OF BOXES.   FRESH VEGETABLES AND FRUIT
 ARE PUT ON THE BOXES WITH THE PRICES  
 WRITTEN ON BITS OF CARDBOARD.  THE    
 FARMER GROWS MOST OF THE FRUIT AND    
 VEGETABLES HIMSELF.  THEY ARE CHEAPER 
 THAN THE ONES IN THE SUPERMARKETS AND 
 SOMETIMES THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN PICKED  
 HALF AN HOUR BEFORE WE BUY THEM.  MY  
 MOTHER SHOPS AT THE FARM BECAUSE IT IS
 CONVENIENT, CHEAPER AND GOOD QUALITY. 
 THERE ARE NEW LAID EGGS FOR SALE.  THE
 EGGS ARE STACKED IN TRAYS AND SOME    
 STILL HAVE STRAW ON THEM FROM THE HEN 
 HOUSE.   YOU CAN ALSO SEE A WHITE GOAT
 WHICH IS KEPT IN A PADDOCK.           </content>
