		<title>17Industry in New Invention</title>
		<content> In New Invention industry is split    
 into 2 industrial estates.The largest 
 is on Fryers Road it consists of a    
 large number of factories employing 20
 to 70 people but over a third of these
 factories are now closed down.A       
 section of the estate is set aside for
 13 small factory units each employing 
 about 10 people.Most of the factories 
 in the area are light engineering     
 firms making all sorts of metal and   
 plastic objects.There are 2 exceptions
 to this one is a chemical waste       
 disposal plant specialising in toxic  
 chemical waste and the other is a     
 heavy engineering firm making large   
 metal sections for the construction   
 industry.The Walsall Refuse Department
 also has a waste depot in the area.The
 second estate is smaller but again is 
 mainly light engineering.Both estates 
 are close to junction 9 of the M6.    </content>
