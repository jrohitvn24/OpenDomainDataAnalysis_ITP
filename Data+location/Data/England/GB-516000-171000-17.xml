		<content>    This home is for ex-servicemen who 
 are not quite able to look after      
 themselves. Most are permanent        
 patients but some go there for several
 years. They use old fashioned sewing  
 machines to build up their muscles.   
 Many of the men are in wheelchairs and
 don't use their muscles very much.    
 Some of the men are not too bad and   
 are able to drive cars and that is why
 they have a garage. The home has a    
 swimming pool and there is a          
 special lift which can move the men up
 and down into the water. For those who
 are permanent they have a single room,
 some double rooms and some wards. If  
 they had toothache there would be no  
 need for them to go out because they  
 have their own dentist and a bar and a
 canteen. Famous people,including Jimmy
 Saville,  have been there for charity 
 reasons.                              </content>
