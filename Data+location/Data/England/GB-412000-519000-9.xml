		<content> It too is a mixed farm which has a    
 small flock of Teeswater sheep which  
 are kept for breeding purposes. The   
 sheep are pedigree and they are bred  
 for {tup}lambs which are sold at      
 around 8 months to a year old to be   
 crossed with Swaledale &amp; Masham sheep.
 The main income of the farm is from a 
 large dairy herd of British Fresians. 
 There are 180 cattle with 2 bulls, 77 
 cows and 101 calves. The male calves  
 are sold for beef. The Robinsons also 
 keep around 200 Warren henswhich are  
 free range and the eggs are sold      
 locally. Three Llamas are also kept,  
 the female has just given birth to a  
 female calf. Although both farms are  
 mixed farms, each has a bias towards  
 different aspects of farming. Both are
 self sufficient in hay,silage and grow
 enough corn for there own needs.
