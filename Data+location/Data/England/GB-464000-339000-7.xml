		<title>07THE ATMOSPHERE OF SHELFORD</title>
		<content>                                       
   When we visited Shelford on a sunny 
 Monday afternoon in June our first    
 inpressions were that it is very well 
 into the country which means it is    
 quiet with no major roads or heavy    
 traffic. It has no vandalism. there   
 are lots of farms and cereal fields   
 in Shelford but the farms have very   
 few cattle so all the fields are used 
 for crops.The farms are quite small   
 and are fairly well spaced out.There  
 are lots of trees around the          
 churchyard.Most of the buildings are  
 cottages or small houses.At the side  
 of Shelford there is a river and you  
 can easily see the river from         
 Shelford.
