		<content>  Use of the countryside for recreation
 by large numbers of ordinary people is
 a recent change brought about by the  
 availability of relatively cheap      
 transport to townspeople . Little of  
 our area is available to the public , 
 but its northern edge includes part of
 one of the most modern developments , 
 the country park . Motorists from     
 nearby towns come to its car-parks ,  
 and on any fine Sunday , winter or    
 summer , many people are found on the 
 public footpaths of the area ,        
 enjoying the fresh air and long views 
 provided by the rolling hills . Many  
 make Farley Mount Monument , on the   
 very edge of our area the object of   
 their walk . It commemorates an       
 eighteenth century hunting incident   
 and commands a particularly fine      
 panorama .
