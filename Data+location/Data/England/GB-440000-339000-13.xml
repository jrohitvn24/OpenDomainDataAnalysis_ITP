		<content> EVERY YEAR OUR SCHOOL,(STANLEY COMMON 
 PRIMARY SCHOOL C OF E) HAS A SPORTS   
 DAY.I PERSONALLY CAN'T STAND IT,BUT   
 MOST PEOPLE LIKE IT.THE WHOLE SHOOL   
 TAKES PART.WE HAVE A FLAT RACE,A SACK 
 RACE,AN EGG AND SPOON RACE AND A      
 SKIPPING RACE.LAST TIME WE HAD A MINI 
 MARATHON,BUT I MANAGED TO GET OUT OF  
 IT.                                   
  WE HAVE THREE TEAMS;YELLOW,RED AND   
 BLUE THE SAME AS THE TEAM POINTS.THE  
 YELLOW TEAM NEARLY ALWAYS WINS.I AM IN
 YELLOW.                               
  MY FAVOURITE RACE IS THE EGG AND     
 SPOON,BUT MOST PEOPLE PREFER THE FLAT 
 RACE.MUMS AND DADS CAN COME AND ANYONE
 ELSE.
