		<title>12Jobs in Dovercourt- on land</title>
		<content> There are many jobs connected with the
 docks of Parkeston and Harwich which  
 are primarily land-based. Some people 
 live in Dovercourt because their  job 
 has brought them to the area. This is 
 usually the case with Customs Officers
 who are transferred from time to time 
 from one port to another. The Customs 
 are kept busy handling tourists and   
 goods such as cars being imported and 
 exported to and from this country.    
 Apart from dockers' work _ loading    
 and unloading ships - there are jobs  
 for lorry drivers and crane operators.
 Clerical workers are also needed to   
 handle the paperwork arising from     
 shipments of goods.
