 The villages of{Gainford}and{Headlam  
 lie in the Tees Plain, midway between 
 Darlington and Barnard Castle. The    
 surrounding countryside is            
 agricultural farmland which is        
 sparcely populated and interspersed   
 with attractive farmhouses. Good      
 quality grazing is to be found for a  
 variety of livestock and a wide       
 selection of arable crops are grown   
 successfully.                         
{Gainford}today is a dormitory village,
 with the majority of working adults   
 commuting to larger towns, such as    
 Darlington and Bishop Auckland. The   
 village has become largely residential
 and is a thriving community.          
{Headlam,}however, is smaller and more 
 rural in character. White painted     
 cottages and farm buildings seem to   
 predominate.                          </content>
