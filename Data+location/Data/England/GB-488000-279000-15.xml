		<title>15Transport: A43(T) Kettering</title>
		<content>  The A43 trunk road links Northampton 
and Oxford to the south-west of        
Kettering with Stamford and Boston to  
the north-east.                        
  Called Stamford Road this separates  
Avondale and Grange estates. Recently a
man was killed crossing this tree lined
road. Perhaps the traffic is too fast! 
  It is certainly heavy throughout the 
day in both directions. In a half hour 
period on a fine July day a survey     
showed:-                               
        To Kettering: 100 cars,22 vans,
35 lorries,8 cycles,6 m/cycles,2 buses,
        Out of Kettering: 135 cars, 26 
lorries,26 vans,4 cycles,10 m/cycles,  
1 bus and 3 caravans.                  
  From a point just north of Weekley a 
new by-pass road is envisaged to join  
up with the proposed A1-M1 Link Road.  
If this is built the volume of traffic 
through the town could be much reduced.</content>
