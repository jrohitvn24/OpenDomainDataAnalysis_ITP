		<content>  {Trams}came in 1905.They were very   
 popular and ran from{Summit}to{       
{Rochdale}until 1929.                  
    Today many people in our area have 
 got their own cars.There are regular{ 
{bus services }as well-which, like the 
 trams, run from Summit to Rochdale.We 
 also have a service which runs from   
 Rochdale to our other neighbouring    
 town of{Todmorden.}The route through  
 Summit is a {Trans-Pennine}route, as  
 is the one that crosses the South East
 of our area to {Halifax}.             
    Transport is interesting in our    
 valley-over the years the three main  
 types have all played their part in   
 the life and development of our area. 
 Overhead we now hear the sound of the 
 fourth way to travel-the aeroplanes   
 destined for Manchester and Leeds.
