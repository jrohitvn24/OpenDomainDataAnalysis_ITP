		<content>     Our school is a Church of England 
 Aided School which was founded in 1708
 by Edward Lightmaker. He provided some
 education for twenty poor children of 
 the parish. The present permanent     
 building was put up in 1872; there    
 were 120 children educated here then  
 but the average attendance was 78.    
     There are now 94 village children 
 at the school whose ages vary from    
 under 5 to over 11.Four class teachers
 are helped by six other adults.  Our  
 school has a moat, a large playground 
 and a field to play in,a quiet garden,
 a swimming pool and a kitchen where   
 they cook our school meals. We go on  
 lots of outings;we visit local schools
 sometimes for basketball and other    
 sports.Our annual May Fair has dancing
 and a special May play in it. This    
 year the older children went camping  
 for the first time.                   </content>
