		<title>11HOLLYMOUNT KNEESALL</title>
		<content>{ Hollymount}is a group  of houses in  
 Kneesall village that has been built  
 from 3 barns and a farmhouse. A new   
 bungalow has been built also.The barn 
 and the farmhouse are 200 years old   
 and have got some beams.The materials 
 used were mainly brick and tiles.Now  
 builders are repairing and adding     
 to the original group of farm         
 buildings. Our house is made from a   
 barn and is semi-detached. It is      
 called Meadow Barn. When a group of us
 went to visit Hollymount we asked in  
 what age Hollymount was built.The     
 reply was that probably it had been   
 first built in{Georgian}times.        
   A lady called Mrs Maskill used to   
 live in the farmhouse at Hollymount   
 before the barns were modernised into 
 houses.The re-building has been going 
 on for  one to two years.
