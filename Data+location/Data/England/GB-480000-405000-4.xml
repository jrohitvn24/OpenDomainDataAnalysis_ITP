		<title>04A LOCAL MAGISTRATE</title>
		<content> MR.A.CHARLESWORTH SITS IN COURT WITH  
 TWO OTHER J.P'S AND A CLERK, who is   
 the only trained person on the bench. 
 he was proposed as a magistrate by a  
 friend and appointed by the House of  
 Lords.He first sat on the Epworth     
 bench in 1970 and was one of 9        
 magistrates or justices of the        
 peace.In 1978 with the creation of    
 Humberside he was appointed to Goole  
 too .Magistrates wear no uniform.There
 are as many women as men.Magistrates  
 listen to the evidence and come to a  
 decision.Only the chairman speaks.The 
 clerk gives advice.Magistrates deal   
 with minor offences, and send more    
 serious crimes to  higher courts.The  
 most serious crime he tried was when  
 ships docking at Goole were found to  
 have dogs on board illegally.These    
  had not been quarantined and could   
 have brought rabies into the country. </content>
