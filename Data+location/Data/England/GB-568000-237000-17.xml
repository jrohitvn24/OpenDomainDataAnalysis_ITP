		<title>17RELIGION IN STAMBOURNE 2</title>
		<content>  The Congregational chapel was founded
 in 1662 and is well endowed. The      
 present building was erected in the   
 1960's. The former manse stands next  
 door. This is now a private house. The
 church has a semi-retired pastor who  
 lives in the village. One service is  
 held every Sunday; he takes some, and 
 others are conducted by lay preachers.
 The regular congregation numbers about
 25. The famous Victorian preacher,C.H.
 Spurgeon, was brought up in Stambourne
 by his grandfather, who was pastor of 
 the chapel between 1810 &amp; 1864.       
  Some residents of Stambourne travel  
 to nearby towns, eg Haverhill, to     
 attend churches of other denominations
 eg Methodist, Roman Catholic. But     
 church and chapel both have adherents 
 who have belonged to other            
 denominations but now worship in the  
 village where they live.              </content>
