		<content> Forty people,mostly teenage girls,    
 were asked about fashions.Almost half 
 the girls and one of the boys had     
 their ears pierced. All the teenagers 
 had jeans which they wore often.They  
 were matched with T_shirts.           
   It was  fashionable to have some    
 form of radio, tape recorder or record
 player.One third had personal_stereo  
 radios but most had portable radios of
 some kind. More than half owned a     
 record player ; cassette recorders    
 were not so popular.People prefer     
 disks or records to tapes though many 
 have both.The most popular recording  
 group was WHAM!.A fashion             
 with school pupils was to ride BMX    
 bicycles and to have roller boots.    
  Some teenagers have hair dyed unusual
 colours-pink,green,blue,multi but not 
 many in the village.
