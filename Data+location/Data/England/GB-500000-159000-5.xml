		<title>05The Railway Home,Woking.</title>
		<content>  One of the first sights to be seen   
 from the train as it approaches Woking
 from London is a large red brick      
 building in pleasant grounds.         
  The Southern Railwaymen's Homes for  
 Children and Old People in Oriental   
 Road were originally built as a result
 of contributions from railway workers 
 to provide a Home for any children    
 who were orphans of railway workers.  
  In later years due to the reduction  
 in fatal accidents to railway workers 
 there was not a need for such a large 
 Home and it became a Convalescent Home
 for railwaymen and their families.    
  It now offers self-contained homes to
 ex-railway staff and their families   
 after retirement, is a convalescent   
 home and houses children in need.     
  Several refugee families from Vietnam
 were housed there on their arrival in 
 this country.                         </content>
