		<title>09QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY</title>
		<content>    In our survey we found that very   
 few people,only 2.5%,have lived in    
 the village for more than fifteen     
 years.Obviously when the village was  
 first started,in 1968/69,very few     
 people lived here,however it is also  
 known that many of the original       
 villagers have since moved away.On the
 other hand 30% of our sample have only
 lived in the village for between six  
 months and two years.This must be     
 because building has been very greatly
 intensified during the last two or    
 three years.There has always been a   
 constant flow of people moving into   
 the village because of this constant  
 house building.However just as        
 interesting is the constant flow of   
 people moving out of Bar Hill.
