		<content>     We have been finding out about    
 farming in our area. We found out that
 most farms have at least a hundred    
 acres, but a few have two to three    
 hundred acres. The smallest farms have
 sixty and five acres. The largest has 
 three hundred and seventy  acres. Most
 of the farmers work at least eighty   
 hours a week in the summer, but one of
 the farmers a hundred  hours a week.  
 Except for the pig farm every farm    
 keeps cows. Some only keep fifty cows,
 but most keep a hundred cows. Only two
 farms keep sheep. Elmore Farm has     
 fifty eight sheep and Yew Tree Farm   
 has 360 sheep. Hardwicke Farm has 20  
 pigs. The farmers get up at 4.30a.m.  
 -7.00a.m. The main crop from farmers  
 in our area is grass for silage, then 
 barley, and thirdly wheat.            
    Mr. Davidson own's a pig farm.  The
 pig farm is in Elmore. It  was  built </content>
