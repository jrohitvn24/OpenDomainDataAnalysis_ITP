 New Costessey is mainly residential,  
 with a very individual mixture of     
 detached older-style bungalows, and   
 more modern bungalows, chalets and    
 houses, owner-occupied.  There are    
 two major areas of council housing:   
 postwar terraced and semidetached     
 houses to the northwest of the A47,   
 and a very new mixed area to the North
 of this, replacing postwar 'prefabs'. 
 In Old Costessey, there is one council
 development of the 1970s, but the main
 type of newish housing is 'up-market' 
 family houses, in small individual    
 developments.  Of course, the highly  
 individual housing of the original    
 village remains.
