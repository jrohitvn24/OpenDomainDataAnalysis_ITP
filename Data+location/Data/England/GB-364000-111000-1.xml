		<title>01A CONCISE OVERVIEW OF BLOCK</title>
		<content> This block lies in the County of      
 Dorset 3 miles south west of Sherborne
 and consists predominantly of farmland
 with a total of l2 farms within the   
 area.  The main area of population is 
 found in the village of Longburton in 
 the north west corner of the block.   
 Smaller areas of population are found 
 in the hamlets of Folke, Caundle Marsh
 and Bishops Down.                     
                                       
 The majority of the farmland is rough 
 grazing for dairy herds and some sheep
 with a small amount of land used for  
 arable crops.  There are small areas  
 of deciduous woodland dotted over the 
 block and two small brooks cross it   
 from east to west namely Caundle Brook
 and The Cam.  The land is low lying   
 with the highest point 350 feet above 
 sea level just south of Longburton.
