		<title>16POPULATION OF ST. TEATH</title>
		<content> THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE MOVEMENT OF     
 POPULATION INTO, OR OUT OF ST. TEATH  
 UNTIL VERY RECENT TIMES. BEFORE 197O, 
 WHEN THE FIRST HOUSING ESTATE WAS     
 BUILT,THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE        
 INHABITANTS HAD BEEN CORNISH, BEING   
 BORN AND BROUGHT UP IN THE VILLAGE.   
 DURING THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS THERE   
 HAS BEEN AN INFLUX OF PEOPLE MAINLY   
 FROM THE HOME COUNTIES. MANY ARE      
 RETIRED COUPLES FOR WHOM LOW-PRICED   
 BUNGALOWS ARE THE ATTRACTION. A       
 GROWING NUMBER OF VILLAGERS ARE       
 CONCERNED ABOUT RECENT AND FORTHCOMING
 DEVELOPMENT. TWO NEW ESTATES          
 COMPRISING OF ABOUT A HUNDRED         
 DWELLINGS AND MODERN BUNGALOWS GIVE   
 RISE TO FEARS THAT THE VILLAGE IS     
 GROWING TOO FAST AND WILL THEREBY LOSE
 ITS IDENTITY.                         
                                       
                                       </content>
