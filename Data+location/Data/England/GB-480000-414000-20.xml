		<content> On a hot Sunday afternoon in July,Mr  
 Morgan and I took a flight over block 
 0480 0414.We were both slightly       
 nervous but our fears quickly         
 disappeared as we were greeted by the 
 whole of the Isle of Axholme          
 stretching before us.                 
  The fields below were like a         
 gigantic patchwork and the patterns   
 made by the agricultural machinery    
 could clearly be seen.As we flew over 
 Eastoft for the first time I could see
 many of my friends playing on the     
 green and looking up and waving.As we 
 flew onto Luddington the local        
 cricket team were practising.         
  I was surprised at the number of     
 drains,dykes and fields that make up  
 our area,and how few houses there were
 in the landscape.
