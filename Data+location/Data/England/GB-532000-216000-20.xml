		<content>The Sow and Pigs Public House has been 
situated on the A10 trunk road out of  
Ware for five hundred years. It's main 
trade then was to supply ale to the    
farm labourers.                        
The name is derived from a past pub    
game called "My Sow's Pig".            
The premises are owned by the Benskins 
brewery and the landlord for the past  
seventeen years is William Morgan. He  
runs it with his wife and two sons. He 
also employs five full time and eight  
casual part-time workers. He recently  
extended the buildings and the old     
foundations were discovered.           
Mr. Morgan does not regard the "Sow and
Pigs" as a 'local' in the sense that it
is not located near a built up area.   
However it does have its regulars and  
also receives a lot of tourist trade in
summer. Its dining room is quick to    
fill up reflecting its popularity.     </content>
