		<title>07UNUSUAL PLACE NAMES.</title>
		<content> In our block there are a lot of       
 unusual place names.The main village  
 is called Bellingham (pronounced      
 Bellinjum)which comes from the family 
 name de Bellingham who once held the  
 castle here.Hesleyside (which is the  
 manor house)gets its name as it stands
 on a hillside.It was built for the    
 Charlton family who owned most of the 
 land in this area at one time.        
 Dunterley is a little hamlet which    
 gets its name from the Celtic word    
 "dintref" meaning village by the      
 castle.We found the farm name         
 Duckbutts to mean a field with short  
 grass and an obstacle in the          
 centre.Another strange name is the    
 Reenes,which means long furrow-like   
 strips of water to separate cattle and
 crops.
