		<title>10DONINGTON ON BAIN</title>
		<content> The village of Donington on Bain has  
 undergone change in recent years as   
 many working people have moved to     
 employment in Louth,Lincoln and even  
 further afield.The Primary school     
 reached its peak in 1980 with 126     
 pupils.In 1985,the number of pupils in
 the school had fallen to 54.          
 However,the village is developing     
 slowly with new dwellings being       
 constructed on several sites.Some     
 beautiful old houses,including one    
 with a preservation order,(Ivy Tree   
 Cottage),have been demolished to make 
 room.
