		<title>10LIFE OF A SHROTON NEWCOMER</title>
		<content>    A RETIRED RESIDENT WHO CAME TO     
 SHROTON 8 YEARS AGO AND WHO LIVES IN  
 AN IMMACULATE MODERN HOUSE BEGINS A   
 TYPICAL DAY EARLY WITH A SWIM IN THE  
 POOL OF A NEARBY PRIVATE SCHOOL. AFTER
 BREAKFAST SHE GARDENS OR WATCHES      
 BIRDS. AFTER LUNCH SHE MAY GO FOR A   
 WALK IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE OR
 ON HAMBLEDON HILL. DURING THE SUMMER  
 SHE GOES TO THE LOCAL FLOWER AND      
 VEGETABLE SHOWS AND FETES. IN WINTER  
 FEEDING AND WATCHING BIRDS IS A       
 PLEASANT PASTIME. OCCASIONALLY SHE    
 GOES BY BUS TO BOURNEMOUTH TO SHOP. ON
 SUNDAYS SHE NORMALLY GOES TO CHURCH   
 AND SOMETIMES HER FAMILY OR FRIENDS   
 VISIT HER. THERE ARE ALWAYS PLENTY OF 
 ACTIVITIES IN THE VILLAGE LIKE THE    
 OVER SIXTIES CLUB AND SPONSORED EVENTS
 FOR CHARITY. SHE LIKES TO LIVE IN     
 SHROTON BECAUSE OF THE PEACEFUL AND   
 FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE.                  </content>
