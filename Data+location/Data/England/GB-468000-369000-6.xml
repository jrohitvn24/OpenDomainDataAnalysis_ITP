		<content> The largest single employer in the    
 area is the National Coal Board, with 
 both Bevercotes and Ollerton          
 collieries less than four miles away. 
 Outside of coal mining there is a     
 tremendous cross-section of trades    
 amongst the male members of the       
 community, including unskilled,       
 semi-skilled, and skilled workers as  
 well as the professionals such as     
 doctors and company directors. The    
 women in employment who answered our  
 survey displayed a similar span of    
 occupations but with more emphasis on 
 skilled and office workers.           
 Most people who are employed travel to
 their places of work by car, with very
 few using public transport. Although a
 large number of people travel between 
 3 and 5 miles there is a significant  
 percentage who travel over 20 miles to
 work.                                 </content>
