		<content> Main transport is by privately owned  
 car, lorry or motor cycle. Most       
 households own one or more private    
 cars or cycles. Delivery of bread,    
 milk, meat, fish, vegetables &amp;        
 papers is usually by privately owned  
 vans. Coal, bottle gas, beer &amp; heavier
 goods by lorry or heavier transport.  
 There is a twice weekly bus service   
 though from Alford to Louth, latterly 
 the use of the School Bus has been    
 open to the public but little used. A 
 weekly delivery of parcels by British 
 Road services brings in larger        
 parcels. There are no services,       
 petrol, etc., - people travel out to  
 find these. There is a voluntary car  
 service run to enable people with no  
 transport to visit health centres.
