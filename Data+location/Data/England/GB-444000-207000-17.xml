		<title>17Wytham and the Thames</title>
		<content> The Seacourt stream links Wytham to   
 the river Thames. The 144 mile-long   
 river winds from the west through the 
 flat, cultivated farmland that        
 surrounds the village, and is         
 controlled by local locks and weirs.  
 The flow of the river can vary from   
 3-8 knots at this point.              
 Each year the river floods and        
 there are as many as 4 drownings      
 recorded in that time. At and above   
 Wytham the locks are beam locks and   
 are operated by lock keepers who work 
 from 9 a.m. - 7 p.m, six days a week. 
 The families of the lock keepers enjoy
 the peaceful, rural life along the    
 river. Links with the village prevent 
 them feeling too isolated in the      
 Victorian stone houses. The Thames is 
 much used for leisure and the lock    
 keepers' lives are busy ones,         
 particularly from April to October.   </content>
