		<title>09THE MARINE LAKE,NEW PLANS.</title>
		<content>    The Marine Lake is ninety years    
 old.It is just over 1000m long and    
 155m wide.Because of its age and      
 position Wirral Borough Council have  
 decided to replace and extend the     
 existing structure to twice its       
 present width new slipways and car    
 parking will also be provided.        
   The money for most of this project  
 is coming from the E.E.C.,the Sports  
 Council,the Tourist Board and the     
 Ministry of Agriculture.              
   It is hoped that the work will begin
 early in 1986 and that the new lake   
 will be able to cater for new water   
 sports.                               
   There has been considerable         
 controversy about the plans as many   
 conservationists feel concerned about 
 the feeding grounds of the many birds 
 that use the river estuary.
