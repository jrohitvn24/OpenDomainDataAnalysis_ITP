		<title>17BAYSTON HILL INTERVIEW</title>
		<content> This lady that I interviewed was four 
 when she came to Bayston Hill.When the
 children came home from school which  
 was by the church on the common they  
 had to get the water from the         
 well.Because there was no water out of
 a tap.There were two lodges on the way
 to Lythwood Hall but now one of the   
 lodges has been knocked down.The land 
 by the lodges was all meadow.Just     
 ahead of the meadows was a forest     
 which joined up with Parrs wood,the   
 wood by the football pitch and the    
 wood by Lythwood hall.The main bit of 
 the village was by the Common and     
 some of the original houses are still 
 there.The village shop was next to the
 Fox pub.For transport you either had  
 to  walk or later on some people had  
 bikes.This lady likes the development 
 of the village because she has got a  
 job at the Shropshire Oven.           </content>
