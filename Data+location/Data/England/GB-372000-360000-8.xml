		<content> On Sunday 7th July 1985 I got up at   
 08:45.We were going for a picnic.I had
 my breakfast and we were ready to go  
 at 10:30.We arrived near Burwardsley, 
 where we were to have our picnic, at  
 11:45.After we had finished we drove a
 short distance to a farm where we     
 picked some strawberries.We picked two
 baskets full which cost Â£2.36.When we 
 got back to the car we sunbathed for  
 about two hours.We packed away and    
 started for home via Crewe.Here we    
 stopped for our tea at Macdonalds     
 Hamburger Restaurant.Then we returned 
 home and on arrival I played tennis   
 with my brother in the back garden.At 
 about 7:30 I went inside and watched  
 TV until 9:30.Then I played on the    
 computer until 10:00.Being tired out I
 then had a wash and went to bed.
