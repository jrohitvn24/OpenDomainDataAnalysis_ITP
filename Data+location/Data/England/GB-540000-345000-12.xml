		<content> The smaller common British birds are  
 well represented in the area and have 
 generally thriving populations.The    
 larger birds particularly owls and    
 falcons have made a very slow comeback
 as attitudes and the laws have        
 changed.Members of the owl family     
 present in the village include barn   
 owls,tawny and little owls with winter
 visits by occasional long-eared and   
 short-eared owls.There are at least   
 two pairs of kestrels nesting in the  
 village and harriers,peregrines and   
 sometimes ospreys are winter visitors.
 Several rare visitors have been seen  
 in recent years including great grey  
 shrike,jays and a hooded crow.Magpies 
 are beginning to return to the area   
 after an absence of about ten years   
 because otherwise our only            
 representative of the crows is the    
 jackdaw.                              </content>
