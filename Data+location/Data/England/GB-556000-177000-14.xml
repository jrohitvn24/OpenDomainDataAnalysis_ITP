		<content> The redundant school building of the  
 Stifford County Primary School has    
 been sold by the County Council to the
 Thurrock Borough Council.The former   
 Headteacher's house has been converted
 into a residential hostel with good   
 kitchen, dormitory and study          
 facilities.The playing field has been 
 made into a camp site.Half of the     
 school building remains which is being
 remodelled as an indoor activity      
 centre.                               
   Local youth groups and schools can  
 book the centre using it as a base for
 environmental studies,sailing,climbing
 and walking.The centre is run by a    
 management committee formed from      
 representatives of local school and   
 youth groups.                         
   The first International Youth camp  
 was held in August 1985.
