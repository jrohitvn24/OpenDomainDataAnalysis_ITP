		<content> We asked all the  children in         
 the school what time of  work their   
 parents did.We meant of course paid   
 work.Perhaps years ago many people    
 would have worked mostly in the docks 
 and on fishing boats.However nowadays 
 there are more who work in shops than 
 any other single job.Next on our      
 survey  list came jobs in hotels or   
 guest houses,  and close behind came  
 the building industry.                
    A good number still work on fishing
 boats, but several of these are only  
 during the summer, taking visitors out
 on fishing trips.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
