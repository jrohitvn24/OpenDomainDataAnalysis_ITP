 people who look after the village.You 
 have to be 18 to join.They meet on the
 1st Monday of every month.They have   
 elections every 4 years.The council   
 has no real power.It tries to provide{
 amenities that will benefit the       
 village and its people.They want a    
 cycle track for children at the       
 comprehensive school to use instead   
 of a dangerous road. They are         
 discussing it with the county council 
 who say it will cost too much. The    
 track may not be built.The council    
 hope to build a new play area in the  
 village.The county council have to    
 approve this too.As well as this the  
 council have to make sure roads and   
 footpaths are safe for people to use  
 and that the village stays clean and
