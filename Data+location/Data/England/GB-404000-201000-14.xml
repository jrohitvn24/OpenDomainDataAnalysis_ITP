		<title>14DEVELOPMENT OF AMPNEY CRUCIS</title>
		<content>  The subject which causes most        
 controversy in our block is building  
 and land development. Most people are 
 against further housing in the area   
 because they fear that{Ampney Crucis }
 could become a part of{Cirencester.}  
 There are always furious letters of   
 objection to any house building       
 applications, especially in the       
 Conservation areas. There was an      
 appeal to the Secretary of State      
 against the District Council's refusal
 to allow houses to be built at Dudley 
 Corner. The builders won and the      
 houses have been built but any future 
 developer must be prepared for a      
 fight. Residents are determined to    
 preserve the linear character of the  
 village and to object to any          
 development on the football pitch or  
 farmland down to the A 417.
