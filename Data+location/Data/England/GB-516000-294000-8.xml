		<content>   The Holy Trinity church is in Orton 
 Longueville, only 100m along The      
 Village from the main A605            
 Peterborough-Oundle Road.  The church 
 is over 600 years old, and is the     
 oldest building in the village.  It   
 has a large graveyard with lots of    
 graves, with readable headstones over 
 200 years old.  Inside the church is a
 grave of a knight.   The knight was   
 said to have been fighting the Danish 
 soldiers when a sword split his side. 
 His guts all fell out but he tied them
 around his left arm, so he could fight
 on and win.  He eventually died.      
 Other interesting parts are the       
 windows, many of them are stained     
 glass.   There are many plaques inside
 the church, in memory of parishioners 
 and one in memory of a clergyman.
