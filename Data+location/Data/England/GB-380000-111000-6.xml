		<title>06RELIGION IN SHILLINGSTONE</title>
		<content> In the area there are a number of     
 churches and chapels.Each village has 
 a church which dates back to the time 
 of the original Domesday              
 Book.Shillingstone and Child Okeford  
 each have a United Reform Church      
 which was originally a Methodist      
 Chapel. At Shillingstone there is also
 a Gospel Hall,which was a wooden hut  
 in an orchard until 1927,when it was  
 replaced by the present brick         
 building.The Shillingstone chapel was 
 built in 1904,replacing an earlier    
 building in Hine Town lane,dating from
 1853.Shillingstone Church dates from  
 Saxon times;the present building from 
 the 13c.A Saxon head of Christ is over
 the porch and an ancient altar stone  
 on the west wall of the nave.There are
 Norman windows in the nave,discovered 
 when the church was restored in 1858.
