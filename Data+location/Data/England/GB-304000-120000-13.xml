		<content>       There is only one shop in our   
 block. It is the Post Office, which   
 sells all sorts of things, at         
 Greenham. To reach it you have to     
 climb up lots of steps up a very steep
 hillside.                             
       Brian the baker brings bread and
 cakes in his van and there is also a  
 fish van. Untreated milk is delivered 
 by a local farm but there is also a   
 Co-op van which brings pastuerised    
 milk and also sells eggs. A library   
 van brings books every three weeks.   
       Every Monday the doctor comes   
 from Wellington and holds a surgery in
 Ashbrittle Village Hall for people who
 cannot get to Wellington where there  
 is a Health Centre.                   
       There are only two buses a week.
 They both go to Wellington. The       
 Tuesday bus is quite useful but the   
 Wednesday bus takes ages to get there.</content>
