		<title>09Housing in Bacup</title>
		<content> The housing in our area is mainly of  
 the terraced type. Some houses have   
 just been built but most of them are  
 old. A lot of the houses are council  
 houses but now people are buying them.
 There are not as many flats as there  
 used to be, they have been turned into
 houses.                               
      The housing in Bacup is not all  
 at its best,for instance half of one  
 estate road is having to be done up.  
 People still live in some of the poor 
 houses. Builders have been working on 
 the houses for about two years,       
 putting slates on roofs and new       
 windows in. The council told us that  
 the cost is about Â£10,000 per property
 and each takes 10_11weeks to finish.  
 Some of the cost is paid by the       
 Department of the Environment. It     
 gives work to local plasterers,joiners
 electricians and plumbers.            </content>
