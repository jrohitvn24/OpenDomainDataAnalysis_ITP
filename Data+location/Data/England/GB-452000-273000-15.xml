		<title>15The Centra Store</title>
		<content>    Mr. Gorman is the owner of the     
 Centra mini-supermarket.He decided to 
 run a supermarket in the parade of    
 shops so that he could sell household 
 items and food to the people in the   
 Abbots Farm area.He tries to stock all
 the items that people will want.      
    Mr. Gorman's prices are very       
 reasonable and also very competitive  
 with the town centre.As well as       
 selling known brands, he also sells   
 those which are less well known, and  
 in this way beats the bigger          
 supermarkets in town. Mr. Gorman has  
 stocks delivered on a daily basis or  
 as and when required.                 
    Older people tend to prefer his    
 shop because it is more convenient for
 them to go to nearby shops than to go 
 into town. Mr. Gorman feels that this 
 touch of personal service has helped  
 to build up his business.             </content>
