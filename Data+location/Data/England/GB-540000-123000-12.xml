 At 8.45 a.m. the bell goes. Mrs       
 Alexander tells us to be quiet. When  
 we go in we tell each other what we   
 watched on television last night. We  
 have the register and do some         
 handwriting. At 9 a.m. it is Assembly 
 and Emma gives out the hymn books.    
 There are 49 children in our school   
 and they come into our room. Mrs      
 Baileys class sit on the floor and    
 Miss Longs class sit on the spare     
 chairs. We have a story and hymn and a
 prayer.                               
 Everybody goes back to their classes  
 and we are left on our own to work.
