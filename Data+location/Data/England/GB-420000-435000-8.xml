		<title>08GAWTHORP'S FARM</title>
		<content>    The Gawthorps have a Dairy         
 herd.Half our milk goes to the dairy  
 and the other half we bottle and sell 
 to the people of Calverley from our   
 own milk round.We buy cows at Otley   
 market either milk cows at three or   
 four years old or calves to rear.We   
 have one bull who is twelve years old 
 We feed them both hay and silage which
 we have made earlier in the year.Hay  
 is important to cattle because it has 
 vitamin C to help them produce milk.  
        We have over fifty acres of    
 land and half that amount is used for 
 grazing cattle on. The other half is  
 used for growing crops such as        
 potatoes,turnips,carrots,peas and     
 other vegetables.                     
        The farm is run by ten people  
 each having their own job to do from  
 ploughing a field to selling the milk.
