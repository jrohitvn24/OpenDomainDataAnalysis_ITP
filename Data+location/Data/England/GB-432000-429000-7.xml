		<content>      Half way down{Knostrop Road}we   
 stopped to have some photographs      
 taken. When we set off again we picked
 some{wild flowers.}It was rather a    
 pleasant walk and the weather wasn't  
 all that bad.                         
      We went past the{sewage works.}We
 couldn't see them, but we could smell 
 them. When we got to the bottom of the
 road we couldn't go any further       
 because there was a{security barrier, 
 so we walked all the way back again.  
      We decided to walk round the     
{industrial estate,}back to school. We 
 went past quite a few{factories}and   
{derelict buildings,}then we carried on
 walking onto our school playing field.
      I told my mum and dad about all  
 the factories and also about a place  
 where a man told us off for going over
 private property.
