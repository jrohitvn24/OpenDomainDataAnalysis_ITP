		<title>01Tiddington and Shabbington</title>
		<content>   This block contains the villages of 
Tiddington, Shabbington and Albury     
as well as Draycot and North           
Weston,which are no more than a        
collection of houses.The area centres  
round the A418 which is the main road  
from Wheatley to Thame and Aylesbury   
and joins the A40(T).                  
   The River Thame runs through the    
block and forms the boundary between   
Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire.The    
area is predominantly a farming        
community although this clearly does   
not support the whole population,many  
of whom travel out of the area  to     
work.
