		<content> daily. Their aim is to take the       
 monastic life into communities. There 
 are services at St. John's twice every
 Sunday. Though the monks admit they   
 have a small and elderly group of     
 worshippers. In fact a survey of 100  
 households carried out in Horsehay and
 Doseley, showed that church going was 
 virtually non-existent.               
 The third church in the area is St.   
 Luke's church in Doseley. Another red 
 brick building, built originally in   
 1845, it was converted into a 17 room 
 house in 1981. It is an imposing      
 building overlooking Johnston's pipe  
 works.                                
 All three churches were part of that  
 mid-victorian upsurge in christianity.
 Their present situation reveals the   
 contemporary responses of communities,
 where christianity has a much more    
 marginal role to play.                </content>
