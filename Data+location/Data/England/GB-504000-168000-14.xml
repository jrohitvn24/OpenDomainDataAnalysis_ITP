		<content>  At 8.50 the bell goes and we go into 
 school from the playground.We always  
 have something to do as our teacher   
 takes the register.After that we have 
 a school assembly and that usually    
 lasts until 9.30.We then return to our
 classroom,collect our books and go to 
 French.At 10.10 we go back to our own 
 classroom for English.At 10.40 we have
 our first break_hooray!_then at 10.55 
 it's back to work and maths.12.00 soon
 comes and we go to lunch either school
 diners or sandwiches.We play on the   
 playground or the field,if it's       
 nice,until 01.10 when we go in for our
 interesting project period.Our last   
 break is from 02.15_02.30 then it's   
 time for everyones'favourite_{GAMES}

 is time to go home.
