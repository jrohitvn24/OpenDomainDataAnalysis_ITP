		<title>10Washing clothes by C.Jackson</title>
		<content> When she wants to wash clothes my Mum 
 gets out a washing machine.It is      
 called a TWINTUB WASHING MACHINE.It   
 has two tubs,one washes and one       
 spins.My Mum opens the washing side   
 and puts hot water in it.Then she puts
 the washing (clothes) in the hot water
 and puts in soap powder.My Mum then   
 switches the machine on and the       
 machine washes the clothes.The machine
 is worked by electricity.When they are
 washed my Mum puts the clothes into   
 the spinner.The spinner spins around  
 very quickly and dries the clothes.My 
 Mum takes the clothes out and puts    
 them in a wash basket.Then she hangs  
 them out on the washing line to finish
 the drying.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
