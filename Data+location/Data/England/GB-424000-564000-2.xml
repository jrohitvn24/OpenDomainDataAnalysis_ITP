		<title>02Newcastle Transport; Byker</title>
		<content>    In Newcastle there are many        
 different forms of transport.  Most   
 popular is land transport, the{Metro} 
 and{buses.} The Metro works only on   
 railway lines, underground and        
 overground.                           
    We did a survey in{Byker}and       
 noticed that most people found the    
 Metro comfortable, smooth and faster  
 than any other ride.  People found    
 buses bumpy but mainly convenient, the
 city centre being the most popular    
 route.  Out of those questioned most  
 travelled to town twice a week or more
 using the bus for convenience.  Most  
 people used public transport twice a  
 day.  Most people used travel passes  
 for economy or because they were old  
 age pensioners. Fewer had their own   
 transport, finding parking difficult  
 and petrol expensive.  Some use both  
 bus and Metro in one journey.         </content>
