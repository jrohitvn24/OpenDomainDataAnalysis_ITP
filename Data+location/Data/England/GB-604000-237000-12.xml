		<content>The parish church in Raydon dedicated  
to St.Mary consists of a nave and      
chancel but no tower.It has recently   
had new doors donated by the U.S.Air   
Force.It is Church of England and the  
present rector is Reverend Herrington  
who combines this parish with Greatt   
Wenham. At present services are held   
alternately  one Sunday at Great       
Wenham the following Sunday at Raydond 
at 11a.m.The church of St. Johns at    
Great Wenham has a nave, chancel and a 
er. The nave roof was retiled in       
198484f   but 16000 pounds is still    
needed for church restoration.         
A Salvation Army chapel still standing 
at Raydon was until recently a very    
thriving and well used building.Since  
the withdrawal and closure of the hall 
the Salvation Army who were especially 
well remembered for their Christmas    
carol visits now meet in Hadleigh.     </content>
