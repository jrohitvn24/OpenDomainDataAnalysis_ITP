"The sun light shines into my bedroom  
window about 8.00a.m. but I usually    
don't get up. I turn my alarm clock off
and get up about 8.15a.m. Then I go    
into the bathroom and have a wash and  
clean my teeth. Then I return to my    
bedroom, open the curtains and get     
dressed. While all this has been       
happening my mum has been making my    
breakfast. At 8.20a.m. my mum kisses me
good-bye and goes of to work.At        
8.35a.m. I set of for school with my   
Dad.                                   
When the school day is over and I      
arrive home I have a drink and a       
biscuit and watch television. When I   
have finished my drink I either        
practise my flute or I do some         
homework.                              
I usually go to bed at about 8.30p.m.
