		<title>03FARMING IN LITTLE BADDOW</title>
		<content>   The main function of Little Baddow  
 is a centre for the large surrounding 
 agricultural area. The primary type of
 farming in the district is arable and 
 a variety of crops, for example wheat,
 barley and rape are grown. Arable     
 farming is best suited to this area,  
 not only because of the light sandy   
 soils but also the flat low lying land
 is suitable for the many new types of 
 agricultural machinery available.     
   More recently market gardening has  
 developed in Little Baddow and        
 orchards of apples and pears, and     
 fields of peas and beans are a common 
 sight. During the summer months there 
 is an opportunity for the public to   
 pick their own soft fruit.            
   There is some dairying in the area  
 because of the lush grass which grows 
 on the alluvial soil of the river     
 terraces.                             </content>
