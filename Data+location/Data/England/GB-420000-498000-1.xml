		<title>01Gazetteer - Bromp on Swale</title>
		<content>   Brompton on Swale, an ancient       
 village, lies in the centre of the    
 D-block overshadowed by the new       
 motorway A1(M). The East-West road    
 runs from the county town of          
 Northallerton up Swaledale. Branch    
 railway lines to Catterick Garrison   
 and Richmond are closed now.          
   The area is predominantly  dairy    
 farming but does include new estates  
 linked to the long established        
 Garrison at Catterick.                
   The motorway has enabled a number of
 industries to be established, the     
 largest of which is the sand and      
 gravel quarrying in the river flood   
 plain which serves ARC Pipeline       
 Construction.                         
   Angling on the river and the race   
 course bring many visitors to the     
 area.There are also facilities for    
 camping and caravanning.              </content>
