		<title>10Wolf's Caves, St. John</title>
		<content> Along the north coast of Jersey there 
 are many caves. The most well known   
 are the{Wolf's Caves.                 
{                                      
 From the restaurant at{Fremont}which  
 is also called Wolf's Caves,after     
 having a drink in the bar, or a cup of
 tea or coffee, one can go down the    
 400ft. cliff by means of a stepped    
 path to visit these caves. One  can   
 only go through the narrow entrance to
 the caves if the tide is low.         
{                                      
{ Legend}has it that many years ago    
{smugglers}hid their booty in the      
 caves. In order to deter others from  
 entering the Caves, the smugglers made
 wolf noises and although there is no  
 evidence that{wolves}actually existed 
 this is how the caves got their name. 
 No one knows for sure if it is true,  
 so the story remains a legend.        </content>
