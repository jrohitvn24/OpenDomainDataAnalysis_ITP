By the wills of William Pepyn and      
Reginald Lessey of 1562, the first free
village school in Suffolk was          
established in the Guildhall. In 1840  
this was transferred to a new school   
room, now the Church Rooms, and in 1882
to the new Primary School which is     
still in use. So there has been a      
continuity of free education since     
1562.                                  
In 1536 William Treluskant, a great    
grand nephew of John Tradescant, left  
money in his will for education and the
catechism.                             
The Anchor Inn -now known as the       
Compasses- was built in about 1680 and 
bame the centre for village meetings.
