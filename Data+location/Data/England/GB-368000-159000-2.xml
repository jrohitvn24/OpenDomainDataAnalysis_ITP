		<title>02DUNKERTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Dunkerton is a small dormitory village
 on the Cam brook. Because the brook   
 floods in the winter the buildings are
 set back from the banks. The buildings
 are almost all old stone houses,      
 cottages and farm buildings, together 
 with a row of about ten council houses
  Some of the cottages have been       
 substantially extended and other      
 buildings such as an old coach-house  
 have been converted to houses. Apart  
 from two farming families, who have   
 lived there for two generations,      
 almost all the population has arrived 
 quite recently. There are now only two
 working farms, both outside the       
 village, those in the village being   
 just houses. Most people go to work in
 Bath, a few to Bristol or elsewhere.  
 There is no employment in the village.
