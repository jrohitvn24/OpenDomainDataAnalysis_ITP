		<content> ____________________________          
 Many parents are kept busy            
 transporting their offspring to       
 various social events and most young  
 people look forward to their          
 seventeenth birthday when a           
 provisional licence and driving       
 lessons materialise. When they have   
 successfully passed a driving test and
 obtained a car, they can travel       
 independantly and venture further     
 afield in pursuit of interests.       
                                       
 Public transport is very limited.     
 There is an early morning and evening 
 bus daily, but a daytime bus only runs
 on Tuesday, Thursday and  Saturday    
 from Crewe to Chester via many small  
 villages.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
