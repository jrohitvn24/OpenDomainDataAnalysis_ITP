		<content> The area we are covering is a rural   
 one.It is predominately undulating    
 grazing land for cattle and sheep with
 very few crops being grown.Within the 
 area there are four settlements three 
 of which are very small villages and  
 one larger village.The largest of     
 these settlements is called{Evenwood} 
 and the smaller ones are{Ramshaw,Lands
 and{Morley.       }                   
 Within the area there is a fairly     
 large deciduous wood called{Cragwood}.
 And the river{Gaunless},which is a    
 tributary of the river Wear,flows     
 through the area.Also in the area one 
 can follow the course of a disused    
 railway line,which was once a branch  
 line of the Stockton and Darlington   
 Railway.
