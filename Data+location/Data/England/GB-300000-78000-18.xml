		<title>18FAVOURITE PASTIME, EXMOUTH</title>
		<content> My favourite pastime is riding my     
 bicycle. It is a Raleigh Racer with a 
 ten speed gear and 22 inch wheels. It 
 is painted bright blue and looks      
 really new.                           
 I ride it around Elm Road, Phear      
 Avenue and Turner's Avenue nearly     
 every day.                            
 I learnt to ride a two wheeler bike   
 when I was five. I passed my cycling  
 proficiency test at the Community     
 College last year when I was ten. I   
 can now ride my bike on busy roads    
 safely. The busiest roads are Exeter  
 Road, Salterton Road and Rolle Street.
 On Thursday 20th June I counted 19    
 cars, 3 buses, 2 lorries, 14 vans, 9  
 motorbikes and 8 bicycles during a    
 five minute period on Exeter Road.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
