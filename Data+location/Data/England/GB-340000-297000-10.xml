		<title>10FARMING ON THE LONGMYND</title>
		<content>    Farming in this part of{Shropshire 
 is mainly confined to{dairy cattle}and
{sheep rearing.}                       
   The{Longmynd}itself rises to over   
 1400 feet and temperatures are at     
 least 10 deg.C lower than{Dorrington  
 in the valley.Upland mist covers these
 hills for many days of the year making
 everything wet. Winters are severe    
 with over twenty-five days of snow a  
 year.                                 
   The soil in the region is generally 
 poor and shallow and the ground is    
 very rocky in places.Because of the   
 altitude the growing season is roughly
 two weeks later than farms down in the
 valley.Sheep rustling is also a       
 problem for farmers on top of the     
 Longmynd.                             
   The main crops that the farmers grow
 are{barley}and{hay}which are used to  
 feed the cattle.                      </content>
