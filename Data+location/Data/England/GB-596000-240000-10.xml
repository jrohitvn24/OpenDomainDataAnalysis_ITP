		<title>10THE OLD FORGE IN BOXFORD</title>
		<content>                                       
There are still some Tudor houses left 
in Boxford.  This is about the         
Blacksmith's Forge.  The Forge was     
built around the same time as the      
church, about 1450 so the Forge is over
500 years old.  Lots of people visited 
the church when it was finally built,  
but the people who came had to have    
somewhere to stay so they built an inn 
which was called "Chequers".  People   
usually came on horseback or on foot so
they had to have some stables for the  
horses to shelter in, they also had to 
have a Blacksmith's to make shoes for  
the horses, so the inn and the         
Blacksmith's was all one property.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
