		<content> Most of the houses in our area are    
 cottages.Down School Lane the houses  
 are made out of brick.The roofs are   
 made out of tiles.They are called     
 council houses and were built after   
 1945.In Elsthorpe,every house is a    
 cottage and some have thatched        
 roofs.Thatched roofs are made out of a
 special straw.In Grimsthorpe,about 85%
 of houses are old but made out of     
 brick.The remainder are stone.Our     
 school is built of stone and the roof 
 is made of Collyweston slate.Some     
 houses were built over a hundred years
 ago.All houses have fireplaces. We can
 see the chimneys.Water and electricity
 go to every house except to an old    
 lady of 87.She uses an oil lamp for   
 lighting and cooks on an open fire.Her
 kettle sits on the hob.She is happy to
 live like this.She does not want to   
 change.                               </content>
