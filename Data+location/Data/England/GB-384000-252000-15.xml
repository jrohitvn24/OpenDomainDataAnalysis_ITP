		<content> Like most parts of England the City of
 Worcester is able to read the national
 daily newspapers which emanate from   
 London. I refer to such papers as the 
 Times,the Manchester Guardian,the Sun,
 the Star,the Daily Mail,the Express   
 and the Daily Mirror.These particular 
 groups produce Sunday papers as well. 
 The people of Worcester can also buy  
 the Birmingham Evening Mail,a daily,  
 and the Sunday Mail by the same group,
 which is a weekly. Both give news of  
 occurrences in the West Midlands.Local
 news for Worcester people is given in 
 our local daily paper,the Evening News
 and the local weekly Berrows Journal. 
 The Berrows Journal has the unique    
 distinction of being the oldest       
 current newspaper in Britain having   
 been first printed in 1690. Items of  
 local and national news are broadcast 
 on the local radio station R.Wyvern.  </content>
