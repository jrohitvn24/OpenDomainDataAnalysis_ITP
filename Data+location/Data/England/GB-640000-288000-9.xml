		<title>09Road System in Beccles.</title>
		<content>                                       
During the past few years there have   
been many changes to the patterns of   
roads in and around Beccles.The main   
changes have been the opening of the   
By-Pass which takes traffic on the main
Norwich to Lowestoft road away from the
town centre.A new bridge was opened two
years ago over the River Waveney as    
part of this by-pass.                  
Road changes made in the centre of the 
town recently have not proved popular  
with towns people though.These are     
meant to be experimental but many      
people think that they will be         
permanant and are very unhappy at what 
they see to be the ruining of a small  
market town by messing about with the  
flow of traffic.
