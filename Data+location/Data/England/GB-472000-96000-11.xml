		<content> The Library was opened in August 1966.
 It has a book stock of 27,000. It has 
 a room devoted to local history. The  
 membership is estimated at 10,000,some
 members do not live here but work on  
 the Island. The Library displays work 
 by a number of different groups. At   
 this time it is booked up until the   
 end of 1985 with people wanting to    
 show off their specialities. It runs a
 pre-school activities service, during 
 the week and has facilities for school
 classes to come and work.             
 We have a Tourist Information building
 on the Seafront near Eastoke Corner.  
 The hut contains leaflets and books   
 with lots of information about Hayling
 and the surrounding areas.
