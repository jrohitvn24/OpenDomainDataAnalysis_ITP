   Some children at Middle Park Primary
School asked local people about        
employment. "I asked 46 people if they 
had jobs. 11 people said they  didn't  
and 2O people said they did.  Out of   
the 2O people that had jobs 6 people   
worked in London and the other l4      
people worked locally.  The            
unemployment number in this area is    
not really that bad but still is not   
good.                                  
   Children in this area are very      
familiar with the word "redundant"     
although the South East is considered  
to be relatively lucky.Of course       
children were likely to meet a high    
proportion of retired and unemployed   
by doing their survey locally during   
the school day.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
