		<title>15History of Pickering     2</title>
		<content>     In Celtic times the Gavrantuici   
 tribe used their Celtic ploughs to    
 tackle the soils of the lower slopes, 
 establishing some of the farms which  
 later grew into villages.             
     Pickering is thought to have been 
 founded in 270B.C.King Pederus founded
 the town called Pickering where he is 
 also buried.Some people say his tomb  
 is in the large Howe cut into by the  
 road at Raincliffe.                   
     The celts were followed by the    
 Bronze Age.These people built standing
 stone circles at Blakey Topping,Hutton
 Bushell,Wykeham and Farndale.Their    
 barbed arrow heads show that hunting  
 was sustained alongside pastoral      
 farming and much of the forest was    
 felled by them.
