 years old.I go to Elsecar C.E.        
 School.I get up at 08.00.For breakfast
 I have Weetabix and then some toast.  
 Then I go into the bathroom and get   
 washed.Our School starts at 08.55.We  
 go into our classrooms and start      
 reading.It is assembly at 09.15. The  
 headteacher talks to us in assembly   
 and tells us a story and then we say  
 prayers.It is 10.00 when we come out  
 of assembly and get back to our       
 lessons.We do a lot of mathematics and
 work in our jotters.At 11.55 it is    
 dinner time. Nearly all of my friends 
 stay for dinner but I go home and     
 have a sandwich and a bottle of pop.  
 I come back to school at 12.30 and I  
 start playing in the yard.At 13.15 we 
 go in for lessons.At 14.40 we have our
 playtime.Then we do more work or P.E. </content>
