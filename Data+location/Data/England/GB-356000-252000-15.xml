		<title>15Attitudes in Pencombe</title>
		<content> Generally the villagers attitude is   
 that they are lucky to live in such a 
 friendly and attractive area. Those   
 with families consider it a good place
 to grow up in with its own school and 
 well away from the main road. Privacy 
 is possible if you want it but the    
 village community is there, yet not   
 intrusive. There is also a feeling of 
 everyone being on a level and getting 
 on well without excluding newcomers   
 who want to become involved in the    
 community. Many people mentioned how  
 friends and neighbours rally round at 
 times of crisis. The only complaints  
 were of the RAF planes flying below   
 the radar screen creating a horrendous
 noise and of occasional noisy night   
 time car rallies. Even here though,   
 some people saw the planes as a       
 necessary inconvenience, and some of  
 the youngsters loved the car rallies! </content>
