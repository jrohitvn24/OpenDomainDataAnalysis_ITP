		<content> Public and private bus services run   
 through both villages, regularly      
 everyday. The private bus company,    
 Conor and Graham, operates between    
 Hull and Easington, and serves some   
 villages that are not on the public   
 route. The public bus company, East   
 Yorkshire Motor Company, operates     
 between Hull and Withersea with a more
 frequent service but is slightly more 
 expersive. The majority of people     
 commute around the area by motor car, 
 lorries (heavy goods vehicles) are    
 used for transporting goods. Motor    
 bikes of varying sizes are also used  
 for personal transport as to bicycles,
 although these are mainly ridden for  
 pleasure.
