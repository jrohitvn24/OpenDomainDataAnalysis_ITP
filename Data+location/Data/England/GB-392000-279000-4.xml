		<title>04ROMSLEY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Romsley village is a peaceful place   
 and is also quite small. There aren't 
 many things to interest people living 
 in the area, except for the mobile    
 library, cubs and scouts.There are a  
 few corner shops nearby, but people   
 have to travel to Dudley or Halesowen 
 for the main{shops.}The only{jobs}in  
 the area are to do with farming, so   
 many people who live here have to     
 travel to work by car or bus.         
                                       
 The{houses}have fairly large drives   
 and are a long way from the road. It  
 is a very tidy place with no litter or
 grafitti. Recently new houses have    
 been built.People who live in Romsley 
 are different from where we live      
 (Frankley). They are quiet and like to
 keep themselves to themselves.
