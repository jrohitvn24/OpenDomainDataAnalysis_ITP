		<title>10Earning a living in Coates</title>
		<content> THIS GRID AREA IS DOMINATED  BY THE   
 ARABLE FARM LAND THAT SURROUNDS THE   
 RURAL COMMUNITIES OF COATES AND       
 NEIGHBOURING EASTREA.                 
    ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF MEN     
 STILL EARN THEIR LIVING IN FARMING AND
 RELATED JOBS. MANY WOMAN FIND SEASONAL
 CASUAL WORK ON THE LAND.              
    A GREATER NUMBER ARE SELF EMPLOYED 
 IN SKILED  MANUAL PURSUITS SUCH AS    
 BUILDING, TRUCK OWNER/DRIVERS>        
    MOST FAMILIES STILL EXPECT THE MAN 
 TO EARN ALL OR MOST OF THE INCOME, AND
 MOST MEN USE COATES AND EASTREA AS    
 DORMITORIES, COMMUTING TO THE LARGER  
 OFFICES AND FACTORIES OF PETERBOROUGH 
 AND WHITTLESEY.                       
    JOBS ARE MAINLY EITHER PROFESSIONAL
 (TEACHERS, CIVIL SERVANTS, ETC) OR    
 SKILLED MANUAL JOBS (TV ENGINEERS,    
 RAILWAY WORKERS, ETC).
