		<title>19Kington St Michael Shops</title>
		<content>     In Kington St.Michael we have two 
 shops.                                
     One is a{Post Office}which also   
 sells stationery and small toys. In   
 the food line you can also buy most   
 items there, including sweets. From   
 the outside you would not think it was
 a Post Office, because it is just a   
 room in a house. The{opening times}are
 Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri: 9.00-17.30     
 (lunch 12.30- 14.00). Wed,Sat:        
 9.00-12.30. Sun: Shut.                
     The{SPAR shop}has a big glass     
 front, with a corrugated iron roof.   
 This shop is next to the Club, and    
 nearly opposite the almshouses. Here  
 they sell mainly food, including meat 
 and dairy products. They also sell    
 cigarettes, sweets and cards. The     
 opening times are: Mon-Fri:           
 8.30-17.30 (lunch 13.00-14.00).       
 Sat: 9.00-13.00. Sun: Shut.           </content>
