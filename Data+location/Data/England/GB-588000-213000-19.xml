		<title>19A Tuesday in the Life of Me</title>
		<content>                                       
 I am{Janicen Mogridge}this is about a 
 Tuesday in the life of me. I wake up  
 at 6.45 and read till my dad calls me 
 to get washed. When I'm washed and    
 dressed I go downstairs and help my   
 dad cook the breakfast. At school when
 the bell goes we have our assembly.   
 Mrs. Thorpe takes it. She talks about 
 nature. Her assemblies are very       
 enjoyable and interesting.After       
 assembly we go swimming at Milldene.  
 Mrs. Marchant is our swimming teacher.
 She teaches new strokes. When we get  
 to school we have to wait about 1 hour
 and then its lunchtime. I have school 
 dinners. After school at 7.15 I go to 
 guides. This ends at 8.45. Its fun at 
 guides. I have just been enrolled as I
 am ten.
