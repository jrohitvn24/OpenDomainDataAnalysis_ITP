		<title>17RECREATION (ii)</title>
		<content> All houses here have gardens and      
 gardening is undoubtedly the commonest
 recreation. Most gardens are well kept
 and productive. Out of doors, horse   
 riding, driving a pony and trap and   
 the occasional shoot, and indoors     
 yoga, church choir and scrabble       
 parties all take place locally. The   
 Hunt meets here occasionally.Those    
 interested in fishing, swimming,      
 amateur dramatics,photography &amp; bingo,
 join with other communities.One man   
 spends his leisure at the East Anglia 
 Transport Museum of which he is       
 founder member &amp; secretary. Apart from
 darts, the various teams attached to  
 the pub - football, cricket,bed &amp; raft
 racing - must find a ground for their 
 amusement elsewhere. An adventure     
 playground for the children is to be  
 built in our small Parish field this  
 Autumn.                               </content>
