		<title>11Royston Museum</title>
		<content> Royston museum is a new feature of    
 Royston. It opened last year. The     
 building is in Kneesworth Street and  
 used to be a Sunday School.The museum 
 is open to the public on Wednesdays   
 and Saturdays, and to school parties  
 on Thursdays. Inside the museum there 
 are all sorts of things about the     
 history of Royston. Upstairs there    
 are rooms for exhibitions and there is
 a balcony with benches that run right 
 round the inside .Little children used
 to sit up here during Sunday school.In
 the museum there are lots of very old 
 things.There is an organ which still  
 works. There are quite a few old      
 carts, a sewing machine, a printing   
 press and lots of old advertising     
 signs.There used to be 42 inns in     
 Royston ( now there are only 8) Some  
 of the inn signs are on display.      
 There are pictures of the first cars. </content>
