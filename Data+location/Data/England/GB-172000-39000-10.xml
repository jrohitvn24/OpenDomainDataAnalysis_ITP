		<title>10A DAY IN MY LIFE.</title>
		<content> I am a ten year old girl. I live in   
 the village of Carharrack. My home is 
 a bungalow. I get up every morning at 
 eight o'clock and have breakfast in   
 the kitchen. I leave home at half     
 past eight to go to the primary school
 at St.Day.  When I get to school I    
 meet some of my friends in the        
 playground. After registration we     
 take our hymn books into the Hall for 
 Assembly. There are 250 children in   
 our school _150 Juniors and 100       
 Infants. A Maths lesson follows and   
 then it's playtime for 15 minutes     
 which we call tuck playtime.Work      
 continues with English lessons until  
 lunchtime when I have a packed        
 lunch.Then there are more lessons     
 until school finishes at 3.20p.m.I    
 have my tea at 5 o'clock and then go  
 out to play until 7 o'clock. I have my
 supper and read before going to sleep.</content>
