		<title>06Life in Cheadle Hume.</title>
		<content> A lady who had lived in Cheadle       
 Hulme for 46 years was asked about    
 her views on the area.She lives in a  
 house that is over a 100 years old.   
 That is quite unusual.Most houses in  
 Cheadle Hulme have been built in the  
 last 30 years.She likes the area very 
 much. Before the school was built     
 there were open fields and hardly any 
 houses. People usually worked locally.
 Nowadays,many people travel to work in
 Stockport or Manchester.Most of the   
 aeroplanes are a nuisance because they
 go over the houses and disturb the    
 peace.The lady's hobbies include darts
 and bingo. The house has two bedrooms,
 a lounge, a kitchen a larder,and a    
 loft but no cellar.It is installed    
 with gas and electricity,and has a    
 telephone.The house is well located   
 for local shops,libraries and other   
 such amenities.                       </content>
