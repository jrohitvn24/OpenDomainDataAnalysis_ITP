		<content>  We asked people what they thought    
 about the area they live in.          
  The local residents all agreed that  
 dogmess is a problem.In the summer the
 roads smell and the parks are one big 
 dogs'toilet.                          
  The maintenance of roads and         
 pavements is poor.Patchwork repairs   
 are probably the result of            
 rate-capping.                         
  Waste-land could be used to build    
 more shops,nursery schools,community  
 centres or playgrounds.The waste-land 
 created by the demolition of the      
 Basford flats could be restored to its
 former community-style housing.       
  There is a good bus service giving   
 access to all parts of the city.The   
 area has plenty of good schools and   
 the people are friendly.Community     
 spirit is not as strong since the     
 growth of Nottingham from the 1930's. </content>
