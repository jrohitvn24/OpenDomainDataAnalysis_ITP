		<title>19FUN SPORTS DAY IN E.SWINDON</title>
		<content> After the real competitive sports for 
 local Primary Schools at Nythe, we    
 held our first{Non-competitive Fun    
{Sports Day.                           
 This tended to upset the really       
 competitive children who found it     
 difficult to participate without      
 having to win at all costs.           
 We had{problem solving,}making tanks  
 out of 'Coke' cans, rubber bands and  
 canes. A{treasure hunt}type of game   
 was organised with a message to be    
 found by each team.                   
 There was{mini_football, French       
{cricket, rounders,}and lots of things 
 to do with a{parachute and plastic    
{football!}We made paper planes,       
{painted on the pavement}and had lots  
 of problems with hoops and precise    
 verbal instructions.                  
 In fact we had a tremendous time even 
 though nobody actually won !          </content>
