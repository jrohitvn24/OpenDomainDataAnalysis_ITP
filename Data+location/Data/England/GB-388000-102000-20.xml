		<title>20HOUSEWIFE IN SPETISBURY</title>
		<content> My day begins around 7.OOa.m. and     
 consists of breakfasting the children 
 and taking them to school,then        
 returning home to tackle washing-up   
 and housework.This plus washing and   
 baking occupies me until lunchtime.   
 Then there is the evening meal to     
 prepare,and perhaps some gardening or 
 ironing before collecting the children
 from school.This is the'Children's    
 Hour'or 2!When my husband arrives home
 we have our evening meal and'Family   
 time'followed by the children's bath  
 and bedtime.Evenings are a mixture of 
 other little unfinished jobs,sewing,  
 knitting,etc.before bedtime.This is my
 typical day-add to this social visits,
 visitors,shopping,village,church and  
 school commitments,secretarial work   
 for my husband's business,plus 1O1    
 other things which make my day!
