		<title>20FARMING IN THE HORLEY AREA</title>
		<content> The land in this area was once swamps 
 but drainage made it useable farmland.
 In the last 50 years a lot of the land
 between Horley and Smallfield has been
 used for residential development. More
 recently Gatwick Airport has led the  
 use of the land for the many airport  
 services. These include car parks,    
 warehouses, the passenger terminal,   
 and the approach roads, including the 
 M23 with its junction, and the airport
 link road. In spite of this about 50% 
 of the block is still farmed. These   
 farms consist of small nurseries and  
 market gardens, dairy and beef cattle,
 sheep, poultry and a few pigs. Many   
 farms grow their own feed crops       
 including wheat, barley, oats, beans  
 and maize.Many roads in the area are  
 lined with private houses having small
 acreages used for horses, or boarding 
 and breeding kennels.                 </content>
