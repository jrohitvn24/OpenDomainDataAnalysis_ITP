		<content> The farms in the area are: Temple Farm
 Fossett's Farm, Shopland Hall,        
 Beuachamps Farm and part of Sutton    
 Hall. The first three are owned by    
 Alec Steele and Co. whilst the other  
 two are owned by Tabor Farms. There   
 was no co-operation received from the 
 farmers despite questionaires being   
 sent to them.                         
  From observation the main crop on the
 farm land would appear to be oil seed 
 rape. Other crops are barley, wheat,  
 potatoes and peas. Farm machinery is  
 very much in evidence, e.g. the potato
 harvester has taken the place of hand 
 pickers. The crops do not rely wholly 
 on rainfall but also piped water with 
 spray attatchments.                   
  There are many signposted footpaths  
 but on investigation these were no    
 longer in existence as farmers had    
 planted crops over them.              </content>
