		<content> High wages and mechanisation have led 
 to decline in population of           
 agricultural workers. Many of their   
 cottages have disappeared, while      
 others are inhabited by commuting     
 workers in nearby towns.  Apart from  
 barn conversions the only new building
 is a bungalow on the site of Ivy      
 Cottage and the{Village School,}closed
 in 1919. Several farms have historic  
 connections; two of these, on the {   
{VENN ESTATE,} were once a single farm.
 Lower Well, built of half stone and   
 half cob, covers 63 acres. Higher Well
 was converted from a barn, and owned  
 by the same family since 1904. It is  
 of stone with slate roof, and let out 
 annually as grass keep. There is the  
 remains of a pit used until 1900 for  
 cockfighting, now illegal.Fowelscombe
