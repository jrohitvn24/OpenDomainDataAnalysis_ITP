		<content>  This area, most of it lying in a loop
 in the  River Thames, is  one of great
 contrasts.  Predominately it is  rural
 England.  Most of it covered  by farms
 or woodland. Few people live here.    
  In the midst of this rural scene lies
 the  Culham  laboratory of the  United
 Kingdom  Atomic  Energy  Authority. On
 the same site are the  buildings which
 house the Joint  European  Torus (JET)
 which is the largest single project of
 the  co-ordinated research  programmme
 of the  European  Atomic  Energy      
 Community.                            
  The north western corner of the block
 is  separated from  the  rest  by  the
 River Thames.  Here  the  character of
 the landscape is  different  again.  A
 number of disused  gravel pits support
 wildlife  but  the  area  is  in  the 
 process of being  redeveloped  by  the
 Central Electricity Generating Board. </content>
