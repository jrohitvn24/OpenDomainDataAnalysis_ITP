		<content> The village of Markfield is situated 7
 miles to the N.W. of Leicester. It    
 lies on the S.W. extremity of the     
 ancient Charnwood Forest.First        
 settlers were peasant farmers but from
 1800 framework knitting was an        
 additional occupation.The working of  
 igneous rocks at Markfield began at   
 the beginning of the 19th Century and 
 by 1830 Syerite was being quarried.The
 original quarry has been exhausted but
 another working a mile from the       
 village still provides local          
 employment.The population of 5000 is  
 served by a primary school,a secondary
 school,a doctor's surgery,chemist,    
 supermarkets,hairdressers and three   
 churches together with five public    
 houses which make it a self-sufficient
 village.Communications are good as the
 village lies on the A50 and there is  
 an M1 link a mile away.               </content>
