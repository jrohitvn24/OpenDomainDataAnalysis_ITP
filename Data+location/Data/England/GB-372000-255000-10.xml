		<title>10A WEEKEND IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> trying to do my grade two pieces.My   
 parents go{shopping}while I am having 
 my piano lesson.When my piano lesson  
 is over we all go to Bromyard to do   
 more shopping and go to the library.We
 then go home and after dinner I call  
 for my friend Elaine and we play until
 teatime.After tea I watch television  
 until I go to bed.                    
{Sunday:}I get up about 9.00 and have  
 toast for breakfast.I am then told to 
 tidy my room as it is a mess and when 
 I have done that I do other odd jobs  
 or watch television until lunch.After 
 lunch I play with Elaine again until  
 teatime.After tea I wash my hair and  
 have a bath before getting dressed in 
 my night clothes.I watch television   
 until bedtime and then I read in bed  
 until I fall asleep.
