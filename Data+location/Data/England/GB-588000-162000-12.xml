		<content> The Eurolink Industrial Centre is on a
 piece of land to the West of Church   
 Road,Murston,next to the London/Dover 
 railway line.The land which stretches 
 down to Milton Creek was formerly part
 of the Murston brickfields.There are  
 120 acres altogether of which 56 acres
 are already in use.The site has a good
 road and rail links and is close to   
 the ferry and cargo port at Sheerness.
 Most of the units are large factories 
 such as Qualitair(air conditioning),  
 Harris Queensway (carpets),Everest    
 (double glazing).There are smaller    
 workshop units, together with banking 
 and business support services at the  
 Smeed Dean Centre in the centre of the

 sold off to further developments.
