		<content> Mr. Downs has lived in Olveston for   
 nearly 85 years(that is all his life).
 He has actually lived in 5 different  
 houses during that time. His present  
 home he has lived in for 56 years. Mr.
 Downs believes the village has grown  
 too big. Some of the biggest changes  
 he has seen is the increase of motor  
 cars and too many new buildings.      
 Mrs. Ashby lives in the old Infant    
 School at Old Down. At one time young 
 children transferred from this school,
 when they were old enough, to the     
 Junior School in Olveston about 1 mile
 away. The building has been converted 
 since 196O but it was originally built
 in 1857 and closed in 1954. Mrs. Ashby
 has lived there now for some 26 years.
