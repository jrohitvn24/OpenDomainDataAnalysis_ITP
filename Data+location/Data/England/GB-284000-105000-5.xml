 My Saturday by Richard Gill, aged  10 
                            On Saturday
 I go {fishing }at Hollywater.         
 Sometimes I use a float and also a    
 spinner but recently I used snails as 
 bait. I love watching {fresh water    
{shrimps}but  recently I caught a      
 3/4lb cannibal{trout}on a spinner-that
 was in the morning.I do not care if I 
 do not catch anything because it is so
 peaceful and nobody is down there     
 making a noise so you can hear the    
 birds singing. Sometimes you can see  
{minnows}just swimming along in shoals-
 you can sit for hours just watching.If
 you drop a net in it will come up with
 minnows in it.When I go down with     
 Richard Charles he brings his keep net
 Sometimes we go together for a whole  
 day and we collect{snails}for his     
 pond. Then we go home on our bikes.   </content>
