quite a large number of trees some     
in plantations and many natural ones.  
The main species are sycamore,chestnut,
willow and beech trees. As can be seen 
the area is mostly covered by deciduous
trees,a few conifers are grown in the  
plantations,scots pine.                
Through the year the cycle of flowers  
follows a typical pattern.In the       
woods the snowdrops emerge followed    
by the primrose wood anemones and the  
bluebells. Hedgerows flowers include   
dandelions, buttercups and daisies,    
all the common ones are to be found.

Dblock which has some most unusual     
plants growing, to find out more,
