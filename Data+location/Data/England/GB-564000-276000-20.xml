    "WE ARE VERY HAPPY LIVING HERE"    
                                       
THIS IS THE RESPONSE ONE GETS FROM THE 
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THIS AREA. IT IS A  
QUIET, FRIENDLY PLACE, WELL AWAY FROM  
THE MAIN HIGHWAYS BUT NOT CUT OFF FROM 
CIVILISATION. THERE IS A GREAT FEELING 
OF COMMUNITY HERE AND A PRIDE IN       
BELONGING. MANY OF THE FAMILIES HAVE   
STRONG TIES WITH THE AREA AND GO BACK  
FOR MANY GENERATIONS, AND THERE IS A   
SPIRIT OF DETERMINATION AND            
INDEPENDENCE.  PRESSED TO ANSWER THE   
QUESTION "WHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF
LIVING HERE?" MOST WILL REPLY THAT THE 
AEROPLANES ARE NOISY BUT YOU GET USED  
TO THEM AND ANYWAY THEY BRING JOBS!
