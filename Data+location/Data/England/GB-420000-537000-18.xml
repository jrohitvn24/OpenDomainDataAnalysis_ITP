		<title>18WHAT I DID FOR DOOMSDAY 1985</title>
		<content> We heard that Norman Gibbon wrote     
 poems about Brandon so we went to his 
 house.He was getting ready for work   
 but gave us 2 peoms.One was about the 
 Durham Miner's Gala and the other     
 about the local leak show.We then went
 to the Co-op to ask David some        
 questions.We asked him if they got a  
 lot of customers and which were the   
 busiest days.Thursday,Friday and      
 Saturday were the busiest.He said 99% 
 of people were not snappy but it      
 depends if you are polite to them.    
 David has worked at the Co-op for     
 almost 7 years and he enjoys his job. 
 There are lots of store thefts but    
 there are 7 store detectives. Children
 mostly stole sweets but adults went   
 for anything from tinned foods to     
 chickens.
