		<content> Edlingham village was known to exist  
 as long ago as AD 737 in the time of  
 King Coelwulf, when it was called     
 Eadulfingham. The church was          
 consecrated by Bishop Egred (831-47). 
 The estate passed to the Earls of     
 Northumberland, then was granted to   
 the de Edlingham family. Traces of the
 village were found between the church 
 and remains of the castle, the present
 hamlet is 400 metres to the west. The 
 castle was a small fortified manor    
 house, built in the 13th C. The owners
 lived in comparative peace, defended  
 by a moat and palisade. In the 14th C 
 with the advent of border raids, high 
 enclosing walls were built with a gate
 way and Solar tower. After the 17th C 
 the castle was abandoned. Excavations 
 started in 1978 revealed the extent of
 the rooms and courtyard.
