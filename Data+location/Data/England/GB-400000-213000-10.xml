		<content>   There used to be a school at        
 Colesbourne but it was closed in 1960.
 Now all the children go to Coberly    
 school until they are 11, after 11    
 they go to a school in Cheltenham.    
 The school building has now become the
 village hall.It is used weekly for    
 Bingo and for other village functions.
   There is an Inn called Colesbourne  
 Inn.It is just over a 100 years old   
 and was built when the new main road  
 was built through the  village.It was 
 the first stop for stage coaches to   
 change horses after leaving Cheltenham
   Every two hours Colesbourne has a   
 local bus service along the Cheltenham
 and Cirencester road although many    
 people use their own cars.
