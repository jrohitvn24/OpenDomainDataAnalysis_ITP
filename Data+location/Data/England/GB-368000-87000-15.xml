		<content>    The{Winterborne Hospital}was built 
 in 1982 and opened by Patrick Jenkin. 
 It could then take 20 patients, but   
 now 30 can be treated.It has an       
 operating theatre and all patients    
 have single rooms.The hospital was    
 built because of the loss of private  
 beds in the local NHS hospitals.      
    The{West Dorset Hospice Charity}was
 begun in 1983 when an appeal was      
 launched. The idea was to care for    
 cancer patients in their own home. Two
 Macmillan nurses now work in the      
 community. They provide treatment for 
 patients and help for their families  
 at a difficult time.                  
    There are three private{residential
{homes for the elderly}in this area.   
 People who can no longer care for     
 themselves, are looked after in large 
 houses which have been specially      
 converted.                            </content>
