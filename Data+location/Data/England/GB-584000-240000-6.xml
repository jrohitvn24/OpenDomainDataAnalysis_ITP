		<title>06Sudbury's Silk Industry</title>
		<content>  The silk industry in Sudbury dates   
back to the eighteenth century and     
still flourishes today. The cottages of
the weavers of two hundred years ago   
can still be seen but today silk       
workers no longer live and work in     
them. There are three mills in the town
today and each one participates in a   
different part of the manufacturing    
process.                               
STEPHEN WALTERS-This factory produces  
silk from its raw state, dyes it and   
makes material to be finished into     
garments.                              
VANNERS-Specialises in motifs and      
patterns for silk ties. These ties cost
around fifty two pounds in the shops.  
GAINSBOROUGH SILKS-This mill makes fine
silk and produced the material used for
the wedding dresses of HRH Princess    
Anne and HRH the Princess of Wales.
