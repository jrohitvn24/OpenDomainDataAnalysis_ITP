		<content>This is an early Georgian house built  
around 160 years ago.It is in a fair   
condition for its age but needs quite  
alot of general repairs to be carried  
out.It is the middle house of a terrace
of 5 on the A13.The volume of traffic  
passing to,from and through the City is
considerable but is not a distraction. 
In 1984 the house was sold for 31,000  
pounds after being left empty for some 
years.There is a fair sized garden to  
the rear of the house which is also    
being worked on.It is a 4 storey house 
with 2 rooms on each floor.The basement
has a kitchen and living room.The bath 
room is on the ground floor at the back
while the front room has become a study
The rest of the rooms are all bedrooms.
The house contains many of the original
features and it is hoped will be fully 
restored to its former glory.
