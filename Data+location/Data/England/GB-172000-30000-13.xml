		<title>13THE GARAGE,TREVERVA</title>
		<content> The garage owner that we interviewed  
 owned a garage called Mill Garage.    
   The garage carries out repairs on   
 cars,motorbikes,pushbikes,washing     
 machines et cetera.Mainly they repair 
 the vehicles belonging to the local   
 people.                               
   There are only two people employed  
 and they work from 9am. to 6pm.His    
 trade varies quite a lot with the     
 tourist season.                       
   Up until three years ago they sold  
 petrol and diesel which was delivered 
 from Falmouth.He stopped selling      
 petrol and diesel because the law said
 that his tanks were too near to the   
 road.So now the owner concentrates on 
 repairs.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
