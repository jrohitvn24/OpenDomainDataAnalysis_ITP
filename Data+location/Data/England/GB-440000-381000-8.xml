		<title>08Shortbrook Fun Day</title>
		<content>   On June 8th. 1985, Shortbrook Social
 and Junior Sports Club on Westfield   
 Estate held its 2nd annual fun day on 
 Shortbrook School Field. Different    
 organisations had stalls on the       
 playground such as a goldfish stall, a
 coconut shy, greetings cards, hoop-la,
 and cheese and wine. Shortbrook School
 had 2 stalls: a plant stall (plants   
 grown by the 12 year old children);   
 and a tame-life park which gave you   
 the chance to win a cuddly teddy bear.
   The day was opened by the Lord Mayor
 of Sheffield, Councillor Mrs. Dorothy 
 Walton J.P.                           
   The proceeds from the 2 school      
 stalls went to the "Sam the Scan"     
 appeal which is trying to buy a body  
 scanner for the local hospital.       
   Also on the field were 5-a-side     
 football, a bouncy castle, football   
 target practice and a tug-of-war.     </content>
