		<content> The survey area lies between the high 
 ground of Dartmoor to the north, and  
 the English Channel Coast to the      
 south.                                
 The whole area is extremely hilly,    
 reaching over 500ft in the south east 
 and over 400ft at many other places in
 the area.                             
 The River Avon flows south, and is    
 joined by the Torr Brook. These rivers
 are quite swift clear streams and in  
 winter they are quite liable to       
 flooding but only along the narrow    
 flood plain.                          
 The valley sides and coombes are very 
 steep and sheltered, but the hilltops 
 catch the full strength of the winds, 
 especially in winter when the whole   
 area is often swept by gales.         
 The area is near enough to the coast  
 to enjoy long hours of sunshine.      
 Snow in winter seldom settles long.   </content>
