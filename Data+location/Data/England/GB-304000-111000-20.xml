		<title>20UFFCULME TODAY</title>
		<content>   Uffculme is a pleasant place to live
 in. There is beautiful countryside all
 around you and there are lots of      
 pleasant walks to take especially     
 those that go along by the river Culm.
 You can do most of your shopping in   
 the village if you want to but we do  
 miss not having a chemist or a shoe   
 shop. Most people have cars now and   
 this is almost essential because the  
 bus services are very poor. There are 
 plenty of activities in the village   
 for those who like to join in things  
 and people are very friendly here. The
 new houses that are being built are   
 attracting new paople and this is     
 helping to make the activities in the 
 village more varied. Most people now  
 work outside the Village with Lloyd   
 Maunders at Willand and E.C.C. in     
 Uffculme being the two biggest local  
 employers.                            </content>
