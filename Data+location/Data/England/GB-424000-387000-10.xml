		<content> The area is served by minor metalled  
 roads and by many unsurfaced tracks.  
 The main route between Sheffield and  
 Manchester runs along the southern    
 border and is the only 'A' class road.
 The tracks over the moorland are      
 relics of quarrying days,but most of  
 the rough land is not tracked.        
 Parallel to the 'A' road,and          
 approx.0.5 km.north of it is the old  
 coach route,still bounded by stone    
 walling set back from the present     
 surface.At Moscar Cross,it crosses a  
 north/south old road,and this location
 is mentioned in  the classic novel    
{Jane Eyre.}                           
 There are only 2 bus services,one     
 along the 'A' road being twice daily  
 to Bamford and Derwent.
