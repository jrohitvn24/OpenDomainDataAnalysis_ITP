		<content> Only the northern section of this     
 attractive village lies within the    
 grid area, and its church, the Hall   
 and major farms are to the south. The 
 name 'Broom' originated because of the
 predominance of the{plant}in the area 
 in former times, although it is no    
 longer much in evidence to-day. The   
 Post Office is now closed but the{Cock
 public house has existed on its       
 present site for several centuries. { 
 This part of Broom is all residential,
 with mostly modern housing, but       
 including several sympathetically     
 restored old cottages. The surrounding
 countryside is typical of this whole  
 area, being flat and open and devoted 
 to farming or market gardening. There 
 are several individual stands of trees
 and a short stretch of water lying on 
 a small tributary of the river Ivel.
