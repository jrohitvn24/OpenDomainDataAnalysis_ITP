		<content> The area is fairly rich in historical 
 buildings. In Wath there is a{lock-up,
 a stone two storey building which was 
 used as temporary accommodation for   
 drunks and trouble makers until they  
 could be taken to Rotherham.  It had  
 two small windowless cells on the     
 first floor, with the constables      
 office above. It was last used in the 
 mid-nineteenth century, and it is now 
 derelict. Opposite this are the       
 remains of the{Pinfold,}this circular 
 structure was used to, keep stray     
 animals of the village in. At         
{Brampton, the Hall}there was in danger
 of being razed to the ground in l979. 
 It was discovered that inside were    
 remains of oak panelling dating back  
 to the 14th century. The timber is    
 also interesting because it shows many
 carpenters marks.
