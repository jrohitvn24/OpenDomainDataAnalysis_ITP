		<title>09    INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> In our area we have several light     
 engineering industries situated near  
 the canal. However none of the        
 factories use the canal. Some of the  
 factories moved from the City Centre  
 due to bomb damage caused during the  
 war. By far the biggest company was   
 Laughtons which employs 725 people.   
 Other firms make wire etc., bar       
 equipment and other small factories   
 deal in printing. On average most     
 companies worked a nine hour day with 
 an hour or half-hour lunch-break. The 
 INDUSTRY in this area employs mainly  
 women doing manual tasks. The ratio of
 women to men was 7 to 1.
