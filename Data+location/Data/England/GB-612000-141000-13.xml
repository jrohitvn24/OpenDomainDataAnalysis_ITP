		<title>13People in Rhodes Minnis</title>
		<content> Nearly every day people teach me      
 something about things around me. My  
 name is Kirsty Andrea Athow and I am  
 10 years old. I live at Longage Rise, 
 Rhodes Minnis. I have riding lessons  
 at a girl's house her name is Joanne  
 Pierse. She taught me to jump and     
 canter. My sister and I deliver the   
 papers and newsletters, we have a lot 
 of pleasure. We know a lady called    
 Miss Carter. I go to see her when I   
 deliver the news letters. Kerry, my   
 sister is a baby sitter for a lady    
 called Carol Williams. She has a      
 little girl who rides on a horse that 
 is not brokenin. The horse's name is  
 Toffee, she has had two foals and I   
 saw them being born.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
