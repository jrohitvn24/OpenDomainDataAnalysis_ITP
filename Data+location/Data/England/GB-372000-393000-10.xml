		<title>10TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> In 1985 transport is very popular.    
 There are lots of cars and busses.    
 There are cars called Nissan and Ford 
 but we never see a Rolls Royce. There 
 are small cars and big cars and when  
 cars get old they put them in the junk
 yard. There are sports cars which go  
 very fast and now there are cars with 
 computers in them.                    
  There are lots of bus stops like at  
  "The Red Lion" and at Woodsend       
 Circle. On a bus there are two floors.
 You pay the bus driver at the door and
 go and sit down. You get off when you 
 get to your bus stop.                 
  I have a bike.I go out to places on  
 my bike and visit my friend's house on
 it. We have a car called a Datsun     
 Cherry.
