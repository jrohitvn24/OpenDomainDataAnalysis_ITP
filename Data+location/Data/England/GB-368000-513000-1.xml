		<content>          Great Asby                   
 Gt.Asby lies 5 miles from the county  
 town of Appleby-in-Westmorland. It is 
 an area  dominated by farming. The    
 land is gently hilly with mainly      
 improved or rough pastures. There is  
 an equal mix of sheep and cattle      
 farming, and milk herds tend to       
 predominate.In this particular area   
 there is no other  industry.          
      The climate is relatively mild   
 for a northern area, because it is    
 sheltered by the Pennines to the east 
 and the Lake District Hills to the    
 west. Dry stone walls, stone built    
 houses, meandering streams and roads  
 and great quietness make this area    
 attractive for holidaymakers and      
 retired people, but not to the same   
 extent as the Lake District.
