		<content>{Public Transport. Buses.}In our area  
 there is only one bus route and that  
 goes through the 3 S.W. squares. Buses
 come from St.Austell and they go to   
 Fowey. We have one bus every 2 hours  
 from 7a.m. to 7p.m. Buses do not run  
 on Sundays.                           
{Trains.}There is no station in our 12 
 sq. km but the railway line passes    
 from the S.W. corner diagonally across
 the western half of our area. The main
 route is Penzance to Paddington with  
 trains about every 2 hours. Other     
 trains run to destinations further    
 North but just 1 train a day to each  
 region.                               
{Private Transport. Mineral Train.}This
 runs on the W.bank of the River Fowey.
 It belongs to English China Clays and 
 brings clay to Fowey Docks. It is then
 exported. Lots of people have{cars}   
 because of lack of Public Transport.  </content>
