		<title>11LEOMINSTER ANTIQUE SHOPS</title>
		<content>{Leominster}is a busy centre for the   
 antiques trade, attracting dealers and
 buyers worldwide. An important factor 
 is the situation of a large firm of   
 auctioneers in the town. This well    
 established firm, Russell Baldwin and 
 Bright, holds regular collective      
 furniture sales and a monthly         
 specialist antiques sale, the         
 catalogues for which are distributed  
 worldwide. During these sales hundreds
 of lots are sold for thousands of     
 pounds. There is also a large export  
 business in{Leominster,}with furniture
 regularly shipped overseas. Much of   
 this furniture having been carefully  
 restored by local craftsmen. Shops and
 markets in the town sell a variety of 
 antiques, some specialising in one    
 area. Perhaps the most unusual of     
 these is a shop selling only  clocks  
 and barometers.                       </content>
