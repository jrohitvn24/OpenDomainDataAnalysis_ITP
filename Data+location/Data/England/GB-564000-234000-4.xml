		<title>04EXPANSION IN THE SAMPFORDS</title>
		<content> Gt. Sampford is really expanding.Near 
 the school there a fairly new road    
 called Homebridge.There are eleven    
 houses there.There were four council  
 houses opposite the school but the    
 council have pulled them down.In their
 place they put the foundations of     
 three new buildings.There are to be   
 six new council houses in all.This    
 means alot to the village.However they
 now plan to build another twenty      
 private houses behind the council     
 houses.This will mean that more people
 will move into the village.Lots of    
 people think that it will increase the
 the danger when the children leave the
 school.There will be more traffic on  
 the roads.Now that the village is     
 expanding some people want a speed    
 limit but I do not think that it is   
 necessary.
