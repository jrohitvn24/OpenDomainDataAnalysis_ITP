		<title>08The Bournville Carillon</title>
		<content> There are only 13 carillon around the 
British Isles and one of them is in the
Birmingham suburb of Bournville. It is 
situated on top of{Bournville Junior   
School}and is made up of{48 bells}.The 
heaviest known as the tenor weighs just
over 64 cwt and its note is A sharp.   
The bells were all cast in{Loughborough
at Taylors bellfoundry.}They are played
using a keyboard of batons and foot    
pedals which are connected by wires to 
the clappers of the bells. When a baton
is firmly struck the clapper is pulled 
to the side of the bell and the note is
sounded. The instrument is played with 
a series of baton movements by the     
carilloneur. There are{recitals}every  
Friday of school terms and every Sunday
afternoon in the summer months. An     
audience often gathers on{Bournville   
Village Green.}The most popular recital
is at Christmas when carols are played.</content>
