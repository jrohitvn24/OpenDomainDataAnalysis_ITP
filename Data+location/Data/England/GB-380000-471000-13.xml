		<title>13Horton Show</title>
		<content> Horton Show takes place on a Saturday 
 in the first two weeks of September.  
 The school is used for indoor entries 
 and the adjoining field for all the   
 sheep classes.  Farmers from in and   
 around Horton exhibit their prize ewes
 and rams.  The money prizes are small 
 but competition is keen for the       
 rosettes and silver cups awarded.     
 There are competitions for pets       
 and carved sticks.  The local Young   
 Farmers Clubs compete at stock judging
 and dry-stone walling. Inside, the    
 rooms and hall are filled with flower 
 arrangements, vegetables, home-made   
 jams and wines, bread, cakes,         
 biscuits, knitted and sewn garments,  
 photographs, examples of calligraphy, 
 children's paintings and handwork.    
 The number and high standard of the   
 entries says much for the talents and 
 the community spirit of the village.  </content>
