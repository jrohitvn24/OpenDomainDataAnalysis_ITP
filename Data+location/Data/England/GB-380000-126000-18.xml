		<title>18CHANGE: HOUSING, GILLINGHAM</title>
		<content>{We interviewed ten people who had     
 lived in the area for over 40 years.  
 These are the changes they told us    
 about.  The town was much smaller in  
 1935.  Shaftesbury Road council{houses
 and Orchard Road did exist but there  
 were no houses at Peacemarsh, Bay and 
 Commonmead Lane.  Where Lodbourne     
 Green{Shops}are now a fair was held   
 annually.  The doctor's house in the  
 High Street made way for a garage; the
 ambulance and fire stations and two   
{cinemas}have gone _ one was on the    
 site of Gateway's.  Bracher's, Kite's,
 Braddick's, Maddock's, Suttle's and   
 Stewart's remain the same.  Where     
 Johnson's, the chemist is now there   
 used to be a barber's called Peaches, 
 a hardware and sweet shop called      
 Fishes' where Pothecary's is now and  
 Higham's tea shop on the site of the  
 fish and chip shop.                   </content>
