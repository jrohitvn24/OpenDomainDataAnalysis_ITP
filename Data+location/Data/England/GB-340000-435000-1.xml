		<content> This block is a pastoral, rural area  
 with predominant dairy farming,       
 but with a small amount of arable land
 for corn or root crops.  Sheep, beef  
 and dairy cattle graze in the summer  
 and are housed indoors in winter.     
                                       
 Tenanted farm land tends to be        
 amalgamated with larger units, when it
 becomes vacant.  This has led to a    
 change of use for redundant buildings.
 These are being converted into larger 
 than average detached houses.  This   
 has brought more high salaried people 
 into a fairly simple rural community. 
                                       
 Workers in this area commute, for     
 example to ICI Thorton, BNFL Salwick, 
 B.Ae Warton and Preston.  Fewer people
 are employed on the land due to change
 and mechanisation.  Some of these     
 workers still live in tied cottages.  </content>
