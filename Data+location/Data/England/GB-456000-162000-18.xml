		<title>18THE WASING ESTATE</title>
		<content> Almost half of the survey area belongs
 to the Wasing Estate which has been in
 the ownership of the same family for  
 over 300 years. The present Baronet   
 inherited the Estate in 1930 and has  
 held many positions of distinction    
 such as High Sheriff and Vice         
 Lieutenant of Berkshire. The Estate   
 extends far beyond our survey area but
 all of the parish of Wasing  and much 
 of Brimpton falls within it. Many of  
 the  formerly tenanted farms are now  
 managed centrally. There is a small   
 dairy herd but the main emphasis is on
 cereals, with an increasing interest  
 in oil seed rape. Timber is also      
 produced commercially with a long     
 tradition of family interest in fine  
 trees and timber. Parts of the Estate 
 have been subjected to gravel         
 extraction for many years resulting in
 a number of lakes used by anglers.    </content>
