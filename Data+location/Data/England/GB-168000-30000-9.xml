		<title>09Farming: Dairy Farmer's Day</title>
		<content>      My dad is a dairy farmer.  At    
 7.30 every morning he brings the cows 
 into the collecting yard, starts the  
 milking machine and runs hot water    
 into buckets to clean the cows'       
 udders.  He lets the cows into the    
 milking parlour 6 at a time, washes   
 the udders, puts the clusters onto the
 udders and milks the cows.  When they 
 have been milked the cows have their  
 udders washed with disinfectant to    
 stop them getting diseases like       
 mastitis.  The cows must have calves  
 to keep their milk yield up.  During  
 the day the cows are put out to graze 
 and dad gets on with other jobs around
 the farm.  At 6.30 in the evening the 
 cows are brought in for their final   
 milking before being turned out for   
 the night.  The milk is collected each
 day by a large tanker lorry.
