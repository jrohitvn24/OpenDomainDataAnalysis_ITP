 own entertainment because there are no
 cinemas or theatres.In Bovey Tracey   
 there are a group of majorettes called
 the Tracey Troopers.The Tracey        
 Troopers go to carnivals and they wear
 red dresses and white socks.They have 
 got pompoms and batons and they learn 
 to twirl a baton, amongst other       
 things. They practice every Thursday  
 night and every Saturday morning.About
 40 children are involved.The youngest 
 child is 5 years old and the oldest is
 16 years old. They enter competitions 
 all over England.Other entertainers in
 Bovey Tracey include the Bovey        
 Players, an amateur dramatic group.   
 Bovey Tracey carnival is very         
 good.Many clubs and organizations in  
 Bovey Tracey enter floats. It's all in
 aid in charity.
