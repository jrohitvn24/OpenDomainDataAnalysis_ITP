		<content> The{North Riding College of Education}
 teaches teachers. It is being         
 threatened by the Government because  
 they think the College is too small,  
 too isolated and too expensive. The   
 Principal of the College says all     
 these reasons are untrue. The students
 and staff were very suprised when they
 heard about it. The students are well 
 taught and get jobs all over the World
 when they leave. A campaign has been  
 organised to save the College and the 
 public are responding very well.      
 Thousands of people have signed a     
 petition to the Minister of Education.
 If the College closes 545 people will 
 lose their job and the local economy  
 will lose Â£2 million per year. Our    
 school uses the College facilities a  
 lot and we wish them{GOOD LUCK}when   
 the big decision comes on July 28th.
