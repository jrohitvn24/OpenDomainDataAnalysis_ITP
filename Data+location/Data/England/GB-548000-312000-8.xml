		<title>08FRUIT GROWING</title>
		<content>       A lot of  this  area is used to 
 grow fruit.Mr.Bottom is a fruit       
 grower and owns about one hundred and 
 twenty four acres of land. All his    
 fruit growing is done outside.        
      His main crop is Bramley apples  
 which are used for processing and     
 putting in apple pies.He also grows   
 desert apples or eating apples such   
 as  Laxtons and Coxes. Apart from     
 apples he grows Conference pears,plums
 and cherries. The cherries are cooking
 cherries called Marella and are grown 
 mainly for processing.                
        He does not grow vegetables    
 because to grow fruit he just needs   
 one range of machinery,but to grow    
 vegetables you need a completely new  
 range of machinery which is expensive 
 to buy.                               
        There are many problems growing
 fruit.Frost is one of the main ones.  </content>
