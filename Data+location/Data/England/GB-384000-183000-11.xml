		<content>{ DRAINS}Mostly played by girls.You    
 need two three or four people each    
 with a marble and a drain inspection  
 cover.The marbles are placed on the   
 outside corners of the cover and one  
 person is chosen to go first.Each     
 person tries with one flick to roll   
 her marble into the central marking of
 the cover.If none succeed each has a  
 second go until one person's marble   
 reaches that area.That person then has
 a go at the other people's marbles.If 
 they too reach the central area that  
 person keeps them.If those don't go in
 you take it inturns with the remaining
 marbles.
