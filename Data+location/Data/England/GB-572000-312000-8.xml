		<content> The Pentney Church and Village Hall   
 raise funds through an annual joint   
 fete, bringing together various groups
 within the community. 1985 saw the    
 first parade of floats as an extra    
 attraction to the fete involving the  
 Church, W.I., Village Hall and Mothers
 and Toddlers Club. Fund raising within
 the villages consists of pleasant     
 events within residents homes such as 
 coffee mornings, garden fetes, and    
 sherry evenings. Events such as a     
 sponsored bicycle ride and a barbeque 
 raise money for worthy causes both    
 within the village e.g. the Over 60's 
 annual Christmas dinner and also      
 outside e.g. the King's Lynn Hospital 
 C.A.T. Scanner Appeal. The annual Grow
 Sew and Cook Show, organised by the   
 W.I. unites both villages in friendly 
 competition. A celebration was held to
 mark the 50th anniversary of the Hall.</content>
