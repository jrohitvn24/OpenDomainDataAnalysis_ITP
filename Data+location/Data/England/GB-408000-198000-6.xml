		<title>06SURVEY:OCCUPANTS &amp; TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Most of the households have two       
 occupants, showing that there are not 
 very many families. We think this     
 could be due to transport and shopping
 difficulties. One third of these      
 couples are retired people. 20 houses 
 have just one occupant.               
  Out of 120 households, 60 have more  
 than one car, 47 have one car only,   
 and 13 have no car at all. Those who  
 do not have their own transport rely  
 on lifts to get to work, shops,       
 doctors etc. Public transport is      
 sparse and not very convenient. There 
 are only two bus services and they    
 only run twice daily.                 
  Most houses have two drivers in the  
 family. In only three houses is there 
 no-one able to drive.                 
 Of the cars, 78 are English and 67 are
 foreign.
