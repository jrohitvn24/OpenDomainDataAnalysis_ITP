		<title>01AVON VALLEY S. OF AMESBURY</title>
		<content> Much of the area is covered by rich   
 well cultivated farm land. Many old   
 hedgerows, hilltop tree clumps and    
 roadside woods in the valley rmain.   
 With the exception of gardens all the 
 land is owned by large farms or       
 estates. It was striking, in covering 
 the area, how little access there was 
 anywhere to the public. Even access to
 take the accompanying photographs was 
 only very cautiously granted. Nowhere 
 in the area did I find access to      
 either bank of the river. A private   
 area, a private shooting and fishing  
 area with a little fox hunting and    
 recently formed a very few small craft
 trades. Most of the houses are large  
 older but very well kept desireable   
 and expensive suppies and services    
 come by private transport from        
 Amesbury or Salisbury. Everywhere     
 looks wealthy, is clean and well kept </content>
