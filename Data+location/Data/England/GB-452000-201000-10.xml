		<title>10LIFE IN A TOWER BLOCK 2</title>
		<content>     Life in a tower block seems to    
suit retired people.   Some of the     
retired people living in the tower     
block agreed that it was not suitable  
accommodation for children.   At the   
moment families with children are      
housed on the lower levels and the     
Council has a policy of rehousing these
families.                              
     The older people like the feeling 
of security from intruders.   They     
enjoy the views.   One woman said that 
it was like looking at a "sea of       
grass" when she looked at the view     
across the fields.   The flats are     
quiet because the windows have been    
double-glazed.   There is a caretaker  
to look after the flats and their      
occupants.   Given the opportunity to  
speak to the designers the people      
interviewed though that generally      
speaking they had done a good job.     </content>
