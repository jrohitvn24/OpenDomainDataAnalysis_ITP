		<title>08ASHDOWN FOREST</title>
		<content> We have been on many walks in our     
 area. The forest is hilly, with land  
 of 400 feet high. There are lots of   
 streams and wild animals. A Board of  
 Conservators looks after the forest   
 with the help of their Rangers.       
 On the forest there are many different
 trees. There are several roundels of  
 pine trees such as Gill's Lap and     
 King's Standing. Some of the trees on 
 the forest are scots pine, birch,     
 willow, alder, oak and holly. There   
 are also flowers which are foxglove,  
 tormentil, orchids and heather.       
 There are some farms on the forest;   
 many people ride. In our area there   
 are some riding centres. People have  
 lovely picnics. On the forest there   
 are many birds, insects and           
 butterflies. We found a sandstone     
 quarry.                               
                                       </content>
