		<content> People are{worried}about the{traffic} 
 and{pollution}and believe that the    
{agricultural land}is too quickly      
 giving way to huge{housing estates}and
 cheap shops. While the people here    
 believe that the{local government}    
 carries out its various jobs          
 adequately they do not believe there  
 is sufficient concern for individuals.
 The{fire service}comes from Newton    
 Abbot, the inspection from Torquay,the
 street light maintenance is based in  
 Kingsteignton, the{education}system is
 directed from Paignton. There are     
 several primary schools in Newton and 
 most of the villages have retained    
 their schools. There are two secondary
 schools,{Coombeshead}and Knowles Hill,
 which has the 6th form provision in   
 the area.The{Devon Constabulary Police
 are well thought of and supported     
 by the local residents.               </content>
