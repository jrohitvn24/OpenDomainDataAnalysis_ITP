		<content> When I got up I washed my face and    
 hands,cleaned my teeth and got        
 drssed.Then I had rice crispies for   
 breakfast.I went outside and Tony and 
 I played with Zoe and Anthony.We were 
 riding our bikes on the pavement.     
 Leanne and Casey came out on their    
 scooter so we put our bikes away and  
 played on the scooter.For dinner we   
 had fish cake and chips and I         
 watched television for a little       
 while.I watched a film.Afterwards Zoe 
 and I played schools and we took it in
 turns to be the teacher.We had a drink
 and some biscuits and then played on  
 our roller boots.I fell and hurt my   
 knee but I didn't cry but Zoe fell and
 she cried and we put a plaster on her 
 knee.Mummy gave us 20p to go to the   
 shop.Zoe bought shoelaces and I bought
 chewing gum.After tea we watched T.V  
 and went to bed.                      </content>
