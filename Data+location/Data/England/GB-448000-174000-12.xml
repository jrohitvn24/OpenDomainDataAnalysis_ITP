		<content> The area strongly lacks entertainment.
 Although it has three pubs, this is   
 not sufficient for the under 16's     
 because they are not allowed in! The  
 council ought to build play parks with
 swings, roundabouts, slides,see-saws, 
 and the like.                         
    Another idea would be to build a   
 BMX track. This would attract boys and
 girls of all ages.                    
    The area also lacks shops and      
 cafeterias, the parents could then go 
 there whilst their children play in   
 the parks.                            
    It should be evident that the area 
 lacks entertainments for all ages.
