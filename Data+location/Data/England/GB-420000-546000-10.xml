		<title>10A FARM IN WITTON GILBERT</title>
		<content>   The farmer comes from a farming     
 family(his father,grandfather and back
 for many generations).He moved to     
 Fulforth 3 years ago and now works    
 both Fulforth and Witton farms.He is a
 tennant farmer.He remarked that if a  
 tennancy is given up (or lapses) it is
 offered to an adjoining farmer;thus,  
 in effect merging farms.Together the  
 two farms cover 400 acres which he    
 regards as a typical size for farms in
 the area.The labour force is 3 men    
 (the farmer his 18 yr. old son and one
 paid man) but the farmer's wife also  
 helps with some jobs(looking after    
 sick lambs and such like).            
   Since they have moved to Fulforth   
 they have taken down a lot of small   
 out buildings and put up one large    
 shed.In winter it is littered for the 
 cattle(Nov-Mar).Then it is cleared out
 and used as a shearing shed.          </content>
