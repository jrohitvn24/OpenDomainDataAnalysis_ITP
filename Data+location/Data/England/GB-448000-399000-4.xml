		<content> Whilst{unemployment}is causing much   
 concern, particularly as it effects   
 school-leavers, to some it is not seen
 as long-term a problem as other       
 issues. The{quality of family life}in 
 general, and broken marriages and     
 single-parent families in particular, 
 seems to worry many people. There     
 appears to be a predominance of 'young
 marriages', many of which lead to     
 early separation. This very often has 
 a disturbing effect on the children,  
 and causes many problems.             
      Among the generation of{retired  
{people}there seems to be a lot of     
 loneliness and isolation: the         
 community does not appear to be as    
 closely knit as before, possibly      
 because of a{loss of influence}on the 
 community{of the Church.}
