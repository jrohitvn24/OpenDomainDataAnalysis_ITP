		<title>13AROUND GARFORTH</title>
		<content> Garforth is a village that is growing 
 into a small town. Lots of people come
 to live here because it is            
 conveniently placed for travelling by 
 road and rail to Leeds, Castleford,   
 York etc. Garforth could do with a    
 hospital, sports centre and swimming  
 pool. There is one main thoroughfare  
 in Garforth called Main Street. There 
 are shops on both sides of the road.  
 The police station, fire station,     
 doctor and medical centre are all     
 centrally placed in Garforth. There is
 also a squash court, tennis courts,   
 cricket field and rugby field. There  
 are lots of pubs in Garforth, mostly  
 near Main Street where a lot of       
 vandalism is done. Many housing       
 estates have been built in Garforth in
 the last twenty years, containing both
 private and coucil houses.
