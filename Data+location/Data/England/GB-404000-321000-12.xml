		<title>12Buildings of Blithfield</title>
		<content> The village hall at Admaston  has been
 converted from the old school         
 buildings.  It is used or whist       
 drives, WI parties and for fund       
 raising events.  The reservoir forms a
 lake on the SE Side of Blithfield     
 Hall, and on the outside can be seen  
 turrents and battlement.  The large   
 gateway leads to an open courtyard    
 with a lily pond.  The dining room has
 green and gold elizabethan panelling  
 with a display of 36 coats of arms.   
 The great hall is resplendant with    
 Gothic plaster work.  The living      
 quarters are now confined to 4 rooms  
 and the rest is waiting to be altered 
 into modern accommodation or once     
 again to be opened to the public. The 
 ornate gardens have been turned to    
 lawns.  Many of the old possesions are
 now in museums within the county. Much
 of the furniture was sold in 1946.    </content>
