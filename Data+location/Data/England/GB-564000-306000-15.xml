		<title>15Shouldham-A day at school.4</title>
		<content>   Two children open the dinner gate   
 for Mr.Caley and help him carry the   
 containers into the canteen. Most of  
 us stay for lunch-about 20 have School
 dinner and 12 bring a packed lunch.   
  Mrs.Bell is the Midday Supervisory   
 Assistant and she sees that we wash   
 our hands before going into the       
 canteen. Mrs.Revell serves the food   
 and then washes up.                   
  A typical school dinner menu:-       
    Sausage roll(hot)-potato-coleslaw- 
    baked beans-mixed vegetables.      
    Sponge pudding and custard         
  Dinner playtime lasts until 1.10 when
 we go in again.We start the afternoon 
 with reading,either library or books  
 matched to our reading skills. During 
 this time we take it in turns to read 
 aloud either to Mrs.Rolf or Mr.Swift. 
 We end the day with either History-   
 Geography,Art/Craft-Science or Games. </content>
