		<title>11Farming in West Farnham</title>
		<content> The information that follows was      
 gained by sending a survey to all the 
 farms in our D-square.There were 14   
 farms of which 7 replied.             
{Farms Today:}Farms in our area are    
 mainly dairy but some are beef,sheep  
 and arable farms.                     
 From our replies we learnt that one   
 farm is now a recording studio,and    
 that two farms blended together.      
 Another is now a private house.All the
 other farms are still in use.         
{Types of Soil:}The main types of soil 
 are clay,sand,flint and malm.The area 
 around the river Wey is river silt.   
 This makes the land very fertile.     
{Size of Farms:}The biggest farm is    
 Cheek's Farm at 630 acres in size, the
 smallest farm is Holtwood Farm at 22  
 acres. The main types of boundaries   
 are fences and hedges.
