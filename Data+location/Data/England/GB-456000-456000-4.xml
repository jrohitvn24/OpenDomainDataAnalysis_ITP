		<content>     During my leisure time I enjoy    
 many varied activities and pursuits. I
 play cricket and badminton for local  
 teams. I enjoy the competitive nature 
 of sport. It is also a means of       
 keeping reasonably fit and having a   
 social life away from work            
 colleagues.I also enjoy gardening     
 particularly vegetable growing. There 
 is a sense of achievement in producing
 your own fresh vegetables, with that  
 ditinctive "home grown" flavour.      
 Breeding Bantums is a hobby I have    
 pursued since childhood. Bantums are  
 small domestic fowl with a wide range 
 of shape and colour characteristics.  
 Although they are a hobby they are,   
 never the less,profitable producing a 
 ready supply of eggs, they also make  
 very fine table birds and in addition 
 surplus stock can be sold.
