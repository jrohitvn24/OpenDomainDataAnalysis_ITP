		<title>14Armed Forces / Population</title>
		<content> The Armed forces activities in our    
 area are limited to the Marines rifle 
 range on the beach in Kingsdown.Small 
 arms ammunition has been used here for
 nearly 100 years.At one time,some of  
 the targets were out at sea,but they  
 have now been washed away in storms.To
 warn ships in the area,safety lookouts
 are posted at St.Margarets Bay        
 Coastguard Station and on the cliffs  
 opposite the Butts.                   
 From the 1981 census the population   
 for Ringwould was 376 and for         
 Kingsdown 1,442.The people of         
 Ringwould tend to live in the half    
 square mile to the west of the Dover /
 _ Deal road, opposite the Ringwould   
 road. The population of Kingsdown     
 covers a far larger area.It tends     
 to cover the coastal area for about   
 1 mile and is due East of Ringwould.
