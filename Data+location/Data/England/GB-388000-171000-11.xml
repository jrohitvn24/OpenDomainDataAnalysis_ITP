		<title>11BULL BREEDING/M.M.B.</title>
		<content>  The Milk Marketing Board has set up a
 bull rearing farm near Sheldon Manor. 
 The young bulls are used at their     
 nearby artificial insemination station
 when they are mature. Adult bulls also
 rest at the farm between spells of    
 duty at the A.I. centre.              
  Both beef and dairy bulls are kept   
 for A.I. purposes and this reflects   
 the growing trend for milk producers  
 to sell their calves as beef animals  
 shortly after birth. Beef calves      
 provide a quick extra income for dairy
 farmers following the introduction of 
 milk quotas by the E.E.C. in 1984.    
   The A.I. services of the M.M.B. are 
 now available to all farmers.The      
 Chippenham bull breeding farm is part 
 of a national network.
