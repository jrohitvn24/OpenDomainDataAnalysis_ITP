		<title>13ADULT TRAINING CENTRE</title>
		<content> Next door to our school is the Monk   
 Bretton centre for the{mentally       
{handicapped.}It is called an{Adult    
{Training Centre}rather than a school  
 for the mentally handicapped; they    
 attend more or less all the year round
 and work on{various activities}such as
 pottery, weaving,{woodwork and        
{painting.                             
                                       
 They have recently acquired a{plot    
{of land}at the side of the school and 
 with the help of the Parks Department 
 have begun to{cultivate}the land and  
 have even built a{greenhouse.         
                                       
 At{Christmas}they create a{Santa's    
{Grotto}which is absolutely fantastic. 
 All the children from our school are  
 invited to go round to see their work.
