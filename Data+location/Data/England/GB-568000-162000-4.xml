		<content>   The Church of St.John the Baptist in
 Halling stands near the River Medway. 
 It dates from the Norman period but   
 the tower and chancel are more likely 
 twelfth century.Wall paintings of this
 period can be seen over the Chancel   
 Arch.                                 
                                       
   An unusual brass plate commemorates 
 Sylvestre Lambarde's death in 1587.It 
 was placed there by her husband       
 William Lambarde,author of            
 "Perambulation in Kent."              
                                       
   Much repair and restoration of the  
 Church was carried out in the         
 nineteenth century,when the clock was 
 added to the tower and the Lychgate   
 was built.Alterations and repairs are 
 still being carried out in the 1980's 
                                       
                                       </content>
