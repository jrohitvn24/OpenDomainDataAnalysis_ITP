		<content> At first appearance Severnside/Hallen 
 does not look a very attractive area. 
 Along the estuary there are extensive 
 chemical works which produce a lot of 
 smoke which blows over the whole area,
 as the prevailing wind is on-shore.   
 In spite of this, and the fact that   
 the M5 motorway has cut the village   
 through the middle, there are some    
 attractive properties here.           
 There appears to be a policy of       
 passively allowing this village to    
 die, as much of the land is owned by  
 the Companies and then leased out and 
 no permission is being given for any  
 new private development.Local people  
 suspect that this is not the          
 healthiest place to live and there are
 certainly very few amenities.
