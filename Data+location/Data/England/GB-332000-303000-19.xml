		<title>19WORTHEN AND BROCKTON</title>
		<content> This Domesday Project has dealt with  
 the village of Worthen, but in        
 practice this a joint community with  
 the village of Brockton, there  being 
 no gap between the two communities.   
 Because of the 12 km.square allocated 
 for this particular survey the village
 of Brockton is not included, but it   
 would give a false impression of this 
 community if it was not said that all 
 that applied to WORTHEN did also      
 apply to Brockton. Amenities,         
 services, and facilities are shared as
 though it was one village. Most of the
 services,etc are in the Worthen       
 portion of the villages, but there is 
 a South Shropshire District council   
 estate of 45 dwellings in Brockton.   
 The local doctor (Watson) who has his 
 surgery as part of the village hall   
 lives in Brockton.
