		<title>15ASTLEY VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{ASTLEY VILLAGE} HAS GROWN AROUND AN   
 OLD COLLIERY WHICH IS NOW BEING       
 CONVERTED INTO A MUSEUM BY A          
 CONSERVATION SOCIETY (RED ROSE STEAM  
 SOCIETY). LITTLE TRAFFIC USES HIGHER  
 GREEN LANE BECAUSE IT IS A DEAD END   
 FINISHING AT{ASTLEY MOSS.}THE MAIN    
 SHOP IN THE VILLAGE IS THE POST       
 OFFICE. THERE ARE NOT MANY OTHER SHOPS
 BECAUSE THERE IS LITTLE DEMAND FOR    
 OTHER SERVICES. THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY 
 IS MARKED BY THE{EAST LANCS ROAD}WHICH
 LINKS{MANCHESTER }AND{LIVERPOOL}AND   
 CARRIES LARGE VOLUMES OF TRAFFIC.     
 RUNNING EAST-WEST ACROSS THE AREA IS  
 THE{BRIDGEWATER CANAL},ORIGINALLY     
 BUILT TO CARRY COAL FROM THE LOCAL    
 COAL MINES TO THE PORTS. NOW THE COAL 
 IS CARRIED BY RAIL AND THE CANAL HAS A
 LIMITED USE FOR CRUISING AND FISHING.
