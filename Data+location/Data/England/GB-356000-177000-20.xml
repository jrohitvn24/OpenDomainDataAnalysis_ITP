 Great idea! What a pity there was so  
 little time to organize &amp; then        
 complete this survey.Consequently most
 of the research  &amp; recording of       
 information has been carried out by   
 the teachers from the participating   
 schools more than children.           
 The area showed such great diversity  
 that it was often difficult to        
 maintain a common identity;it was     
 really two areas in one.              
 The brevity required on each page made
 it impossible to do justice to each   
 topic.
