		<title>15Changes in Ridgewood.</title>
		<content>   There have been many changes since  
 the 1960's. A{pottery}closed then and 
 most of the men who worked there (from
 6.00am to 6.00pm) lived in Ridgewood. 
 Now people tend to work in Uckfield or
 much further away. Two{housing estates
 have been built in the 1980's. Those  
 living here now are mostly 'Uckfield' 
 people but some are new to the area.  
   Elderly people who have lived here  
 for most of their lives view these    
 changes differently. It used to be    
 more peaceful. Although some feel that
 there are too many houses and cars    
 more believe that it is for the good. 
   Many people from the community have 
 been involved with raising funds for a
 new{pavilion}which is being built in  
 the recreation ground. Perhaps some   
 sports teams will be revived and once 
 again provide entertainment for young 
 and old alike.                        </content>
