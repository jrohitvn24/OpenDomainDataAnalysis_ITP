		<title>12WATTS GALLERY COMPTON</title>
		<content>{George Frederic Watts}was a famous    
 Victorian painter and sculptor who    
 built a country house for himself to  
 escape the London Fogs. The house was 
{Limnerslease}in{Compton}and Andrew    
 took us to see the house in which he  
 now lives.{The Watts Gallery,}with    
 hundreds of paintings, still only has 
 10% of Watts work and was opened in   
 1904. With the exception of Good      
 Friday, Christmas Eve and Christmas   
 Day it is open every day of the year. 
 It also contains some of his original 
 sculptures. There are portraits,      
 landscapes and a series of paintings  
 showing life for the poor.            
 Mrs. Watts ran a pottery in Compton   
 for many years and built the nearby   
{Memorial Chapel}in the cemetery.      
 This is an ornate, decorated building,
 bright-red because local clay was used
 for the bricks.                       </content>
