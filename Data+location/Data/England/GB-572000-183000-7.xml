 It takes 6mths for the grass to start 
 to grow on the piles of rubbish. There
 are all kinds of wild plants and      
 flowers there which attract wild life.
 Where the leachate comes of the       
 sprayer the plants that grow there are
 seaplants because the leachate is     
 salty like the sea. Sea asters grow   
 along the{VANGE AND EASTHAVEN CREEKS. 
 There is some hemlock growing there   
 and it has some purple blotches on the
 stalk and they are poisonous.In some  
 places the earth has sunk and thats   
 because the rubbish rots quicker than 
 in the other places. Where it has sunk
 there is water and it is from the     
 leachate and the rain.Land away from  
 the actual dumping site is used by    
 farmers for grazing their cattle and  
 sheep.
