Several parishes have been joined      
under one priest.Church attendance has 
fallen in recent years possible due to 
changes in the social make-up of the   
area.At Haseley,where there used to be 
large numbers of estate workers, the   
church is virtually unused.            
    Apart from the 3 churches at       
Hatton,Haseley and Rowington there is a
independent chapel at Shrewley Commom. 
Methodists travelled to their church   
in Warwick.                            
 The Rev.Cannon of the 3 combined      
Anglican churches produces a parish    
magazine which acts as an organ for the
discussion of local issues. It also    
reports local events such as the church
garden party and gymkhana, and provides
a diary of future local events         
including the fixtures of Rowington    
Cricket Club.                          </content>
