		<content> The public have access to a variety of
 media sources, television being one of
 the prime forms. Four tv channels are 
 available, two of which are broadcast 
 by the BBC. The local independent tv  
 company is Anglia Television based in 
 Norwich.Television programmes are     
 often recorded on VCR's for later     
 viewing. Four channels of national    
 radio broadcasting are supplemented by
 local programming from Chiltern Radio,
 the local ILR station and by Radio    
 Bedford. National and daily newspapers
 and magazines are delivered to the    
 villages as well as the locally       
 printed Bedfordshire Times. A free    
 weekly newspaper financed from        
 advertising revenue, "the Citizen" is 
 also available, although its primary  
 circulation area is the new city of   
 Milton Keynes nearby.
