		<content>   In{Cedar Ward}there are 15 residents
 sharing three flats. There are doors  
 dividing the diningroom and a big room
 and these are opened when they have   
 discos to make one enormous room. At  
 the end is a bar, and an organ which  
 is used every Sunday for a service.   
 There is no carpet on the floor as    
 a fire precaution and there are fire- 
 proof blankets on the beds.If parents 
 go away for a week their children     
 come here for a holiday.              
    The{Amber Wards}are for men who can
 do things for themselves and the      
 nurses are preparing them for when    
 they go home. They have their own     
 bedroom and wash their own clothes.   
    The people on{Belmont Ward}may be  
 any age but they act as if they are   
 one or two years old and need extra   
 care, because they are unable to do   
 anything for themselves.              </content>
