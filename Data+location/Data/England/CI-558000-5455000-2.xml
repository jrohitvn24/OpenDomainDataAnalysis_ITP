		<title>02The Devil's Hole        (1)</title>
		<content>   The Devil's Hole is out at St.Mary. 
 The hole is under a cliff. Boulders   
 are hurled about in the sea, not      
 pebbles.                              
   The legend of Devil's hole started  
 on October 20th 1851 when "La         
 Josephine" went past the west of      
 Jersey but they misjudged the tides   
 and were swept into the north of the  
 island.                               
   "La Josephine" drove ashore under   
 the cliffs called{'Creux de Vis'.}The 
 crew remained onboard but at night    
 the weather became calm. One man      
 jumped overboard to get help but was  
 swept away and was never seen again.  
 The rest of the men got onto a rock   
 and were saved. As the wreck broke up 
 it was discovered that the figurehead 
 had been washed up through the hole.
