 In my house we have four people. My   
 Dad, Mum, Kimberley my sister and me. 
 My Mum works in a shop and is called  
 Carole Bennett. My Dad is a policeman 
 and his name is Ian Bennett.          
  The work which is needed to be done  
 round the house is vacuuming, dusting,
 two kinds of washing, ironing and many
 other things. I help my Mum by keeping
 my room tidy. At our home we have two 
 rabbits _ one is a grey one called    
 Fluffy and one is a white one called  
 Twinkle. We clean them out every week 
 by putting sawdust in and hay and     
 fresh water. We take our rabbits for a
 walk in the back garden but they don't
 enjoy it. In our house we have to     
 abide by rules such as safety in the  
 home, matches and medicines on high   
 shelves, saucepan handles facing      
 inwards.   S.BENNETT                  </content>
