		<content>    My mum does dressings for leg      
 ulcers and post operative wounds,     
 which are surgical wounds when you    
 have just had an operation (usually   
 young people). She helps the elderly  
 to keep clean, advises on family      
 planning, does{electro_cardiographs   
 (ECG), helps to rehabiliatate people  
 i.e. to walk, talk and feed themselves
 after operations. She gives           
{immunizations}against polio, tetanus, 
 diphtheria and whooping cough.        
    She also helps people with         
 emotional and physical needs. She     
 helps with the{counselling}of the very
 sick and their families for cancer    
 and multiple sclerosis. There is also 
 urine and blood taken which is checked
 for diabetes and kidney failure. For  
 the incontinent (young or old) my mum 
 provides any necessary aids i.e. inco 
 pads, catheters.                      </content>
