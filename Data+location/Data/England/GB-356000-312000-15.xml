		<title>15THE VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> RODINGTON VILLAGE SCHOOL HAS TWO      
 CLASSROOMS. THE INFANTS HAVE A MOBILE 
 CLASSROOM WHICH IS LIGHT AND AIRY. THE
 JUNIORS OCCUPY THE ORIGINAL BUILDING  
 WHICH IS COOL AND DARK EVEN IN SUMMER 
 AS THE WINDOWS ARE HIGH. THERE IS NO  
 HALL SO THE SCHOOL USES THE VILLAGE   
 HALL ONCE A WEEK FOR THEIR P.E.       
 ALTHOUGH THERE IS A KITCHEN AND THE   
 SCHOOL DINNERS ARE COOKED ON THE      
 PREMISES, THERE IS NO DINING ROOM, SO 
 THE CHILDREN CLEAR THEIR DESKS AND EAT
 THEIR MEAL IN THE JUNIOR CLASSSROOM.  
 THE TOILETS ARE OUTSIDE THE MAIN      
 BUILDING.  THEY FROZE FOR SEVERAL DAYS
 THIS YEAR, SO THE SCHOOL HAD TO CLOSE.
 THERE IS A SMALL PLAYGROUND WHICH IS  
 QUITE NARROW.  THERE IS A HOUSE       
 ATTACHED TO THE MAIN BUILDING.  THIS  
 USED TO BE THE SCHOOL HOUSE FOR THE   
 USE OF THE HEAD TEACHER.  IT IS NOW   
 RENTED OUT.                           </content>
