		<content> Quite a lot of people go horse riding.
 Some have their own horse and go to   
 shows &amp; join Pony clubs. A horse needs
 a field of grass and a stable of      
 straw.You need a saddle,bridle,brushes
 &amp; a leading rein.                     
                                       
      Many people go fishing round here
 because there are lots of lakes in the
 fields. People go fishing as their    
 hobby. Some people fish over night &amp;  
 some people go at 4 o'clock in the    
 morning.Fishing is a quiet hobby &amp; you
 need lots of patience to do it.       
     Shooting &amp; beating are very       
 popular. There are usually eight bush 
 beaters. After a shoot everyone should
 get a share of the game and a bottle  
 of beer. The beaters have to get      
 sticks and shake all the bushes to get
 all the animals and birds out.
