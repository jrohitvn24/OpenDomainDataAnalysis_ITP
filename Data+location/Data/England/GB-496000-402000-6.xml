		<content> Approximately 81% come from outside   
 the area from as far north as         
 Newcastle and Aberdeen, to as far     
 south as Barnstable in Devon. Further 
 south we have a family from the Natal 
 in South Africa and further east we   
 have a family from Holland.A number of
 reasons were given to suggest why     
 families have moved to our village    
 ranging from :closer to work, buying a
 bigger house, wanting to live in the  
 country, marriage, wanting to return  
 to England.Reasons for possible moves 
 away were similar with :to find new   
 job, buy a bigger house, cost to get  
 to work and job, medical reasons, and 
 wanting to live more in the country.
