		<title>07Housing in Dean</title>
		<content> As most of Upper Dean is a            
 conservation area care has had to be  
 taken in any new development and      
 redevelopment to ensure that such     
 building does not introduce a suburban
 influence into the area and in fact   
 makes a positive contribution to the  
 character of the village. So it is    
 ensured that new houses are           
 appropriate in terms of siting, design
 and materials used. New properties    
 have been built by the Brook at the   
 Yelden end of the village, on the road
 down to the ford and adjacent to the  
 Chapel.                               
 There is a larger proportion of new   
 buildings in Lower Dean, though they  
 are mainly designed to blend with the 
 surroundings, with much use of wood.  
 The old pub is now a house and 2 barns
 have been converted to bungalows.     
 There is also a new Roman Villa.      </content>
