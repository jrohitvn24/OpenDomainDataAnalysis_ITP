		<title>20VIEW OF BARNSTON</title>
		<content> I sit on Barnston's window sill,      
 All is quiet all is still.            
 No busy streets of London Town,       
 Pleasant colours,no black or brown.   
 Off to school at a run.               
 "You'd best be quick,school's begun." 
 Happy voices laugh,sing and shout.    
 The bell rings,it's quiet,            
 There's no one about.                 
 Off to work mothers and fathers go,   
 By bus or car to and fro.             
 Home from school by car (or walk).    
 They gossip,giggle or talk.           
 I pull the curtains across the sill,  
 Again all is quiet,all is still.
