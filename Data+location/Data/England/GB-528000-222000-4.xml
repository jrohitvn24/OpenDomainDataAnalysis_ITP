In the CHANCEL are the tombs of Sir    
Edmund de Benstede (d.1432) and Joanna,
Sir John (d.1359) and his wife Petron- 
illa (Moyne) (d.1378) and other commem-
orative descriptions. The chairs date  
from 1600. In the 14th century CHAPEL  
is depicted the figure of a king with a
sword thrust through his body. This may
represent the murdered King Edward II. 
A burial vault under the chapel may    
contain the final remains of the first 
de Benstede, and was used again in the 
18th century by the Chesshyre family.  
The present Chapel altar was used as   
the main altar in 1800. (Cont.)
