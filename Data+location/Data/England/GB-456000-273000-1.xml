    In our area there is only one      
village, that village is called        
Yelvertoft.We live in Yelvertoft and we
go school in Yelvertoft too.           
    The main features of Yelvertoft are
three shops, three Churches, the       
school, and the village hall.          
    The rest of our area has lots of   
farming land.                          
    Our area also has the M1 Motorway  
running through it.                    
    The area has two hotels and a      
garage called the Halfway Garage.
