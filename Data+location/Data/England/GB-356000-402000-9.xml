		<title>09Working At Wigan Hospice</title>
		<content>Wigan Hospice was opened in 1983. It is
a cross between a hotel and a hospital.
It depends on public donations as the  
stay of a patient is free. There are 3 
wards, registered for 10 beds. Monday  
and Thursday are for day care patients.
Usually there are about 5 or 6.        
My mum is a nurse on night duty at     
Wiganspice. She arrives at 8.50pm and  
changes into her uniform. Then she goes
to the nursing station for a report    
which takes about 20 minutes. At 9.30  
the patients are settled down for the  
night. Each patient has a buzzer to    
ring the nurse. My mum has one hour    
off during the night. At 7.00am the    
lights are switched on and the patients
are got ready for breakfast. The day   
staff arrive at 7.50. At 8.00am my mum 
comes home.
