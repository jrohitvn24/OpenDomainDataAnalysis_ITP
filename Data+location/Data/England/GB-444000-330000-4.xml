 'Canal Shardlow' is designated a      
 conservation area with the aim of     
 re-deploying existing facilities.     
 Shardlow became an important inland   
 port about 1761 with the building of  
 the Trent and Mersey Canal, inspired  
 by Josiah Wedgewood, the famous potter
 and built by James Brindley.          
 Warehouses were built to store goods  
 to be trans shipped from the canal    
 narrow boats to the larger barges on  
 the Rivers Trent and Derwent.   Inlets
 were constructed to provide additional
 wharf space with supporting crafts    
 such as rope making, smithying        
 and crane buidling.                   
 Shardlow's prosperity declined in the 
 mid 19th century when the railway took
 away the traffic from the canals.     
 Bothe Hall Old Sawley is a Grade 2    
 listed building.                      </content>
