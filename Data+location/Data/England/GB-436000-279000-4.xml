		<title>04WALSGRAVE CHURCHES</title>
		<content> A lot of the local history around     
 our area comes from the two           
 churches.This is because one of them  
 is about 900 years old,the other being
 19 years old.                         
 Even though they are next to each     
 other they are called different       
 names.One is called the Risen         
 Christ,the other is called St.Mary    
 Magdelene.(St.Mary Magdelene is the   
 oldest.) They have 6 key services each
 week,3 of these are on Sunday,but     
 there are 4 services on the first     
 Sunday of every month.                
 They both have choir boys and choir   
 girls,more girls than boys,and        
 altogether they have roughly about 20.
 The church is also used for youth     
 clubs,brownies,guides,cubs and scouts 
 etc,and every day they have something 
 going on.                             
 The vicar is Rev.C.A.Bradshaw.        </content>
