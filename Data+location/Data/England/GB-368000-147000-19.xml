		<content> THE CHURCH combines with nearby Stoke 
 St Michael for services. There is a   
 Sunday School once a month.           
 THE SCHOOL has 32 children aged 4 to  
 9yrs and two teachers. The building is
 120 years old with outside toilets.   
 THE BELL INN is the only public house.
 It is a 16th century building and has 
 a restaurant and skittle alley.       
 THE VILLAGE HALL is on the housing    
 estate opposite the pub. It is used   
 for the old people's club, the W.I., a
 Mother's and Toddlers group, jumble   
 and other sales and discos. There is  
 no youth-club or other young-people's 
 organisations.                        
 THE RECREATION GROUND is used for     
 football and cricket  and for the     
 annual village fete. There is also a  
 SOCIAL CLUB.
