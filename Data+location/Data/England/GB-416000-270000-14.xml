		<content> The church of SAINT MARY THE          
 VIRGIN,lies midst a network of        
 twisting lanes.                       
                                       
 The oldest part is believed to date   
 from 1190.                            
                                       
 There is a little chapel reached by a 
 staircase.It forms an archway.        
                                       
 There is a clock which is one of the  
 oldest in the country.                
                                       
 A hundred years ago there were 315 in 
 the morning service and 245 in the    
 evening.There are alot less now.      
                                       
 This beautiful and ancient church is  
 well worth a visit.You may see a bat!
