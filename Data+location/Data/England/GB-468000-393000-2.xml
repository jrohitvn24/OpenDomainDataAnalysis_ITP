		<title>02OCCUPATIONS IN MISSON</title>
		<content> In Misson there are lots of people    
 with occupations.My Mum is a teacher  
 and my Dad is a Probation Officer.Some
 people from Misson School went around 
 the village interviewing people to    
 find out the occupations.Some of the  
 information came from what we know    
 about ourselves.We have quite a lot of
 farmers and retired people.Next door  
 to me there is one person who is      
 retired and my other neighbour,a      
 lady,works in a shop during the day   
 and in a pub at night.Along the street
 there is another family the lady is an
 insurance broker's clerk and the man  
 is a farmer who works mostly on a ford
 tractor.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
