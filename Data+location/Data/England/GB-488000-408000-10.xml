		<content>  My Nana, aged 63, gets up at 7 am and
 has a cup of tea. She then washes and 
 dresses, and walks her{dogs}about two 
 miles. When she comes back she has a  
 cup of coffee. Later she goes         
{shopping,}usually in her own car. When
 she comes back at 12 noon she makes   
 dinner and washes up afterwards.      
  Some of her afternoon is spent       
{knitting}or{crochetting.}About 3 pm   
 she has another cup of tea then she   
 does some{rug making.}Towards teatime 
 she takes her dogs for a walk. About  
 5 pm she makes tea and afterwards she 
 washes up.                            
  Most of her evenings are spent       
 reading or watching{TV.}Then she has  
 her last drink of cocoa and goes to   
 bed, usually about 11.30 pm.
