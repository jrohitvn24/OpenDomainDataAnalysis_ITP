		<title>05WEST WITTERING AND EAST HEAD</title>
		<content>{SITUATION}                            
   Because of its position, West       
 Wittering is surrounded by sea on two 
 sides, the English Channel and the    
 broad expanse of Chichester harbour.  
                                       
{EAST HEAD}                            
   Where these meet is the well known  
 peninsula called East Head which is   
 essentially a long sand bank on which 
 marram grass has been planted to      
 protect it against erosion. Over the  
 years the sea has breached it but it  
 is now being carefully conserved by   
 its owner the National Trust.
