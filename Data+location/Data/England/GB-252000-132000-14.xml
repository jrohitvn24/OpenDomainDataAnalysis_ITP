 improvement centre has been there for 
 14 years,{UBM}sells 80% of its goods  
 to trade, its busiest day of the week

 affect UBM's trade.{Brian Fords,}a    
 superstore,has been on{Seven Brethren

 bulk.{Brian Fords}don't feel          
 threatened by{Tesco}wanting to build a
 new hypermarket elsewhere in the town.</content>
