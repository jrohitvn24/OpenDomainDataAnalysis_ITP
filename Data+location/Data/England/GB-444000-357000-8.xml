		<title>08HUTHWAITE</title>
		<content> Huthwaite is OK I suppose but         
 sometimes it is a bit boring. Just    
 around the corner from where I live   
 there is a little park. There are two 
 big parks in Huthwaite. Huthwaite is  
 only a village and hasn't got many    
 shops. It has got a library but it    
 isn't that big. There are two schools 
 in Huthwaite which are Common Road C  
 of E Infants School and mine. Some    
 parts of Huthwaite are quite nice. I  
 live down Blackwell Road on Bonser    
 Crescent. It is only a little street  
 and there are not many houses. On the 
 end of our street is a little lane.   
 Near where I live are some fields, the
 first field you come to is called Top 
 Field.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
