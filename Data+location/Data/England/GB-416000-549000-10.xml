		<title>10THE BIG RACE</title>
		<content> On June 22nd 1985 over 1000 spectators
 gathered to see the gruelling hill    
 climb from South Moor to Quaking      
 Houses,which was part of the 70 miles 
 Vaux Brewery Grand Prix Cycling Race. 
 The race was established in 1961 over 
 116 miles and attracted world wide    
 entries;contining until 1970 when Vaux
 withdrew sponsorship.                 
 Now Vaux have brought back the race   
 over a shorter distance,attracting    
 entries from as far as Scotland and   
 Yorkshire.Starting and finishing at   
 South Moor,the race passes through    
 Quaking Houses,the prime climb for 10 
 laps.                                 
 There are 3 categories in the race    
 with prizes totalling Â£1000.The Grand 
 Prix is now recognized as one of the  
 premier races in the U.K.due to the   
 excellence of the course and competent
 local organization.                   </content>
