		<content>   WE DECIDED TO FIND OUT WHAT TYPE OF 
 PEOPLE LIVE IN BATTLE. TO DO THIS WE  
 COUNTED ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE PASSING BY,
 EXCLUDING ANY WHO WERE OBVIOUSLY      
 TOURISTS. MOST OF THE PEOLE WE SAW    
 SEEMED TO BE MIDDLE AGED OR OLD, BUT  
 WE FOUND THAT A SIMILAR COUNT TAKEN AT
 THE WEEKEND SHOWED A HIGHER PROPORTION
 OF YOUNG PEOPLE. WE FOUND THAT BATTLE 
 DOES HAVE A LARGE POPULATION OF OLDER 
 PEOPLE BECAUSE THE COST OF HOUSING IS 
 HIGH SO YOUNG COUPLES CANNOT OFTEN    
 AFFORD TO LIVE HERE. THER ARE ALSO FEW
{JOBS}AVAILABLE IN BATTLE AS IT HAS NO 
{INDUSTRIES}SO YOUNG PEOPLE WILL NOT   
 MOVE HERE. THE OLDER PEOPLE LIKE      
 BATTLE BECAUSE IT IS SO QUIET, BUT THE
 YOUNG PEOPLE FIND THERE IS HARDLY     
 ANYTHING TO DO. THIS MEANS THAT YOUNG 
 PEOPLE ARE CONTINUING TO MOVE AWAY AND
 BATTLE'S{POPULATION}IS GETTING OLDER.
