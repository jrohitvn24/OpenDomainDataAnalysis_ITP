		<content>{DARTS: Justin Harlock Age:9           
 I like playing {darts},{darts}are     
 little things that you throw at a     
 round board made of cork.Me and my    
 friend play{darts}nearly every night. 
 We score in rounds.I take my{darts}   
 then throw them at the board then add 
 my score up,then my mate has his go.  
 Most proper games start with 501 and  
 work downwards.Eric Bristow and Keith 
 Deller are my favourite players.      
{BOXING:  Paul Partridge Age:10 }      
{Boxing}is like a game but there are   
 two opponents and a referee.Each      
 opponent has a pair of gloves and a   
 gumshield.The opponents play in a     
 square ring with ropes.The object of  
 the game is to knock the other person 
 out for ten seconds.There's a bell    
 that tells you when to stop fighting. 
 The referee holds up the winners hand.
 The judges decide who wins by points. </content>
