		<content>{Hefferston Grange}is the oldest site, 
 apart from the Church,in Weaverham .It
 is thought to be the Hall mentioned in
 Domesday Book.Now it is a largely     
 derelict Georgian Building whose      
 grounds are used as an old peoples    
 hospital.It has an old ice-house and  
 Adams ceilings in some rooms.         
 On West Road there is a small{cottage 
 once thatched which may be as old as  
{13th c.}Another old building is{Poplar
{Cottages}which is just being done up. 
 This makes the main street very narrow
 and dangerous.                        
{Weaverham Grammar School}is now a     
 private house,but it was run in the   
 19th c. by the Parish Church.It too is
 a very old building.                  
 Most of the rest of old Weaverham is  
 Georgian with some Victorian cottages.
