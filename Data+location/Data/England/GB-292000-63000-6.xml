		<content> Around Meadfoot Beach and Hesketh     
 Crescent there are a lot of hotels and
 flats.At the south end of the beach   
 there is a cliff and at the top there 
 is Daddyhole Plain which is a famous  
 lookout.Across the beach by the       
 parking spaces there is a spring of   
 mineral water.At the other end of the 
 beach there is Ilsham Valley with     
 playing field and puplic woods.Bishops
 Walk is a coast walk around Black Head
 which was The Bishop of Exeter's      
 favourite stroll when The Palace Hotel
 was The Bishop's Palace.Anstey's Cove 
 is a rocky beach and very             
 uncomfortable to sunbathe on.A bit    
 further on is Redgate which is a lot  
 sandier and more comfortable with     
 steps going up to Walls Hill.Other    
 beaches are at Oddicombe and          
 Babbacombe.
