		<content> In Tonbridge the major  religion      
 is{Christianity.}In the school survey 
 that we carried out recently,more     
 people didn't go to church than did.  
 Out of the classes we surveyed, 66    
 people didn't go and 48 people did.The
 churches that they went to were The   
 Parish church and St.Stephen's which  
 are{Church of England}churches,and    
 the{Baptist}and{Methodist.}Of those   
{who }went to church most went to the  
 morning service, and only one went to 
 the evening service.Quite a lot of    
 children went to{church clubs},like   
 Scouts, Guides and Boys Brigade, but  
 not so many went to{Sunday School.
