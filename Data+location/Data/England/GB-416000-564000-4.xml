		<title>04The Glassworks</title>
		<content> They export to N &amp; S America, N.      
 Zealand and Australia. The sand used  
 for making glass comes from Scotland  
 and Belgium. Production only stops at 
 Christmas and New Year; but furnaces  
 must remain hot. Annual fuel costs:   
 gas, Â£500,000, electricity just under 
 Â£250,000. It is cheaper to use gas    
 than oil. The glasswork's cone is a   
 listed building no longer in use. It  
 is constructed of about 2,000,000     
 bricks. Newcastle City Council hope to
 renovate it and lease it to small     
 industries for studio glass.          
   Mr. Goodwin, the manager, says that 
 although plastic is used more and more
 for glass containers there will always
 be a place for glass.                 
   Also in the area are a number of    
 factory units on two small new        
 industrial estates.
