 and{Charlton Marshall}(pop.820)and the
 surrounding farmland. Some families   
 especially those in farming have lived
 here for generations and older        
 residents have seen many changes such 
 as the decline of the railway and     
 increase of road traffic.Now many     
 people have moved in from all parts of
 Britain,most work outside the villages
 in{Poole}or{Bournemouth,}but are      
 attracted by village life.There are   
 many village activities.Housing varies
 from old cottages now modernised,to   
 bungalows which attract many retired  
 people and new houses in{Charlton     
 which have increased the number of    
 young families.Alongside more usual   
 rural industries{Spetisbury}has a     
 watercress farm,{Charlton}a fibreglass
