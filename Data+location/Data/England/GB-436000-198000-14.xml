		<content>The milkman had to push his cart up    
and down the rough country roads and   
paths.The milkman had to start his job 
very early or he would not finish it   
in time.                               
   One of the jobs on the farm was to  
plough the fields by guiding the big   
shire horses up and down.              
   People did not have much money      
during the war so they were not able   
to have as many things as we do        
now.Some women went to work on the     
land so they could earn some money and 
look after their children.Also there   
was a shortage of food so people had   
ration books that they could take to   
the local shop  and get food from      
there.                                 
   There used to be a big hospital     
just outside the village and many      
people worked there. It is sold now.
