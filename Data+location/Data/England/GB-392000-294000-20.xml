		<title>20Local Dialects</title>
		<content>The "Black Country" has always had a   
distinctive dialect.   It is claimed   
that it derives from Early English,    
(many words are found in Chaucer). Over
the years the growth of mining and the 
iron industry has attracted workers    
from beyond the region adding other    
variations, particularly Shropshire.   
 Radio and TV is supposed a major cause
in the demise of dialect, and it is    
spoken most fully now to entertain, or 
for preservation. Some elements survive
in normal speech "I ay" for "I am not",
"Yo cor" for "You cannot".  "Yo am"    
replaces "You are". Words still in     
popular use are "share" for "shall     
not", while "Me" is used for "My".     
Compressions are "cum" for "comb"      
"reglar" for "regular". "H" is usually 
an unsounded consonant while "a" is    
pronounced shortly as in cat, e.g.path,
bath, unlike nearby Birmingham's "ar". </content>
