		<title>10FISHING IN LYMM</title>
		<content> In Lymm there are three main waters   
 which I fish in:  the Bridgewater     
 Canal, the Dam and the Tanner Pool.   
 At Tanners Pool, which is fairly      
 secret so not many people fish there, 
 you can catch pike, perch and roach.  
 To catch pike I use a spinner and no  
 bait.  For perch and roach I use      
 maggots, worms and bread.  My best    
 catch is 4 perch in one hour.  My best
 catch at the best place which is the  
 farside from Highfield Road, about 2  
 metres from the side was a 24 pound   
 pike.                                 
 The Lymm Angling Club are in charge of
 the fishing on the Dam, and there are 
 many special places called "pegs"     
 where people sit to fish.  Lymm       
 Angling Club hold many fishing        
 competitions.  At the Dam peg 14 and 1
 are the best.
