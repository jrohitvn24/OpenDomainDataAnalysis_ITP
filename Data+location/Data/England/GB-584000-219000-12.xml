		<content> In the first Domesday Book there was a
 Mill recorded on the site where       
 Easterford Mill stands in 1985.       
 Easterford Mill was built around 1750 
 and enlarged in 1812. Mr Robert       
 Starling,who was a previous owner,    
 shut the gates, the water flooded back
 towards Coggeshall Road he was found  
 guilty of doing the flooding.Mr       
 Rogers owned the Mill in 1930 and was 
 the last person to grind corn.The Mill
 has 3 grinding stones,the Mill also   
 has an 11 foot water wheel and 7 foot 
 paddles. They had a place to go when  
 they wanted a break somebody has      
 engraved his name in the floor.The top
 floor is called the Bin Floor and is  
 used for storing corn. When the corn  
 is coming down the chute to make it   
 come down slower there is something   
 called a Chattering Female.
