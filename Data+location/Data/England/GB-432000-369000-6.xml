		<title>06SHOPPING IN HOLYMOORSIDE 1</title>
		<content>{  }A survey was conducted to          
 investigate people's shopping habits. 
 A sample of 46 people was used and    
 four questions were asked.            
  {                                    
{1) How often do you shop in           
{Holymoorside?                         
                                       
 Every  3 or more  less than 3   once/ 
  day   times/week  times/week   week  
  13        11          7          14  
                                       
    The survey suggests that most      
 people use the local shops only once  
 per week. Many of those surveyed were 
{pensioners}who could not shop         
 frequently and were collecting their  
 weekly pensions. The large number of  
 shoppers using Holymoorside daily     
 could be explained by people          
 collecting  such as {newspapers.
