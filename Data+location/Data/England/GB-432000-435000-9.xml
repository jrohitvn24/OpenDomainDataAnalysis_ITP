		<content> There are still quite a lot of        
 back-to-back houses in Harehills. They
 were built during the nineteenth      
 century and Leeds has more than most  
 other cities in Britain. The Council  
 are trying to get rid of these houses 
 because they are not up to modern     
 standards. It is not possible to      
 provide as much ventilation in such   
 houses as it is in through terrace    
 houses. Fire dangers are greater in   
 these houses too.  In an ordinary     
 house there are at least two doors    
 from which to escape, but a           
 back-to-back house has only one door. 
 If the fire is blazing between the    
 occupants and the door there is little
 hope of rescue or escape unless a     
 window can be reached.
