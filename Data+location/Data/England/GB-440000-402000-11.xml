		<title>11The Wat Tyler Public House</title>
		<content>   When Mr Simpson started work as a   
 publican at the Wat Tyler the place   
 was derelict. There were mice and dust
 all over the place. He cleaned,       
 redecorated and was ready for business
 in December 1984.                     
   The trade was very slow due to the  
 Miner's Strike and a general lack of  
 money in the community.               
   Mr Simpson introduced pool and darts
 to attract the customers. Towards the 
 end of the strike business began to   
 pick up and he added discos and       
 quizzes to his entertainment. The pub 
 now has a lot of regulars. Their      
 favourite drink is beer and they drink
 4-5 barrels a week (each holding 18   
 gallons). Mr Simpson has no problems  
 with drunks and enjoys running his pub
 very much although,being a seven day  
 working week,he gets very tired at    
 times.                                </content>
