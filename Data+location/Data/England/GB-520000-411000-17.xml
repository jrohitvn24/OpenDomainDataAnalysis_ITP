		<content> Most families have a private car which
 gives personal mobility. The road     
 network is comprehensive and the      
 recent building of a motorway near the
 village has given villagers access    
 to a national motorway network, and   
 relieved the village of considerable  
 day to day traffic. For those without 
 a car the railway provides an hourly  
 service into Grimsby and a link with  
 the intercity trains. For shorter     
 trips bicycles are commonly used and  
 occasionally taxis. The movement of   
 Agricultural Produce is almost        
 completely by lorries which have      
 access to individual farms. Industrial
 produce is moved partly by lorries but
 also by a private rail link to one of 
 the major Humber Bank factories.      
 Although not in the survey area people
 in this block have easy access to air 
 transport only 10 miles away.         </content>
