		<content> Tha area consists of farmland, mainly 
 used for grazing, and deciduous and   
 coniferous forest. West Wood, which is
 a part of Lyminge Forest, is          
 maintained by the Forestry Commission 
 and provides pleasant forest walks and
 picnic areas. To the south east lies a
 small corner of the village of        
 Lyminge. This section is mainly modern
 two and three bedroom bungalows. The  
 village of Rhodes Minnis is composed  
 of a small number of houses strung    
 along the single main road. Also to be
 found along this road is the former   
 manor of Sibton Park, now a private   
 school for girls. To the west lies the
 village of Stowting with its church   
 and two teacher primary school. The   
 area is completely unspoilt and has   
 changed very little over the years.
