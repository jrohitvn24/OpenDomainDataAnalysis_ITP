{iron ore seams}in the area led to the 
 formation of{Hepworth Iron Company}by 
 a group of textile men. The           
 seams were                            
 difficult to work and the project lost
 money. Further exploration turned up  
 workable{coal seams}which were mined  
 until the late 1940's. During the mid 
 1800's an abundant, high{quality clay 
 was discovered and bricks were made in
 connection with building of a         
 reservoir.{Brickmaking}became a       
 commercial venture - a characteristic 
 blue brick and clayware pipes became a
 sideline which eventually made the    
 company the largest producer of       
{vitrified clay pipes}and fittings for 
 drainage and sewer purposes in the    
 building industry. In 1922 the G.P.O. 
 placed the first order with the       
 company for conduit for ducting cables</content>
