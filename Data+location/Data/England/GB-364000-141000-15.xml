		<title>15FARMING.(ONE)</title>
		<content> Our area is mostly{farmland}and there 
 are 18 farms which are in the area or 
 are outside the area but have land in 
 it. Most of the farms are purely{dairy
{farms}but a few of them grow{crops}or 
 rear{pigs}or{hens.}Some of them also  
 keep{beef cattle.}The commonest cow is
 the{Friesian}and they are milked twice
 a day but on three farms they are     
 milked three times. Most of the milk  
 goes to{Express Dairies}at{Frome}and  
 the farmers and workers keep a bit.   
 All the dairy farms make{silage}and   
{hay}for the Winter. They cut the grass
 twice sometimes three times to make   
{silage.}The crops that they grow are  
{maize, barley, wheat, oil-seed rape   
 and{fodder beet.}In each case nearly  
 every farm in our area has more cattle
 on it than both{Doulting}and{Cranmore 
 Parishes had put together when the    
{Domesday Book}was written in 1085.    </content>
