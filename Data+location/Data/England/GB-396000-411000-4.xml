		<content> In{Piethorne valley}there are some    
{kissing gates}with two latches on     
 either side.These stop{sheep}from     
 mixing together because the sheep have
 worked out a way to get through.      
 There is a wood in Piethorne called   
{Bluebell Wood.}We know that there are 
{wood mice}there because the warden put
 some{mammal traps}out and he caught   
 one. One person thought they saw a    
{squirrel.}We found some{owl pellets}so
 there must be owls living in the wood.
 People used to keep food fresh by     
 using{corn cellers.}In Piethorne there
 are ruins of an{old inn}where people  
 used to buy{beer wine and spirits.}A  
{fresh horse}would also be rented for  
 the journey over the moors. There is  
 an old{Packhorse bridge}which carries 
 the{Rapes Way}but you can only see it 
 when the{reservoirs}are{low.}
