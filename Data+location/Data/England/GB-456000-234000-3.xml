		<content>   On an estate in Brackley some old   
cars and a coach have been dumped. They
are no longer any use and have been    
propped up on bricks as they have no   
tyres. A Councillor said that it made  
the estate look untidy . As well as    
that, the Councillor felt that rusting 
vehicles were dangerous in housing     
estates.                               
   Lots of babies have been born in    
Brackley Cottage Hospital. One nurse   
who has worked in the twelve-bed       
hospital for twenty-four years is      
retiring this year. They call her      
"Super Nurse". She says that delivering
babies is a miracle and that no two    
babies are the same. She has been a    
nurse since 1943.
