		<title>05GUBBIONS HALL</title>
		<content> Gubbions Hall is a 17th century house 
 surrounded by a 12th century moat.It  
 was once the home of Mr and Mrs Roland
 Adams who in 1977 gave the house to   
 the Abbeyfields Trust.The Trust is a  
 non-profit making organisation that   
 provide homes for old people.Each of  
 the six residents has to have a       
 sponsor.Before the people come they   
 have a interview and one month trial  
 at the house.They have to be          
 independant enough to look after them 
 selves.Each person has his or her own 
 bed sitting room which they furnish   
 themselves.There is a tiny kitchen off
 each room where the residents make    
 their own breakfast.The house keeper  
 cooks two meals a day.She told us     
 her only rule was 'Don't be late      
 for dinner!'.No pets are allowed, but 
 ducks swim in the moat.The Abbeyfields
 trust runs 700 homes in England.      </content>
