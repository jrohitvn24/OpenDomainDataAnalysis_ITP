		<content>         This station was originally   
 opened as Medstead station in         
 1868, three years after the line      
 opened, but was renamed Medstead and  
 Four Marks in 1937.The station        
 buildings are a fairly basic structure
 on the platform and a separate station
 master's house. The station reopened  
 in 1983 when trains ran through from  
 Ropley once more. The line slopes     
 steeply from Medstead down to Ropley. 
 The engine drivers used to call       
 travelling through Medstead 'going    
 over the Alps'                        
                                       
          When Medstead station was    
 reopened children from Medstead       
 School, dressed in Victorian Costumes,
 reenacted the opening ceremony at     
 Medstead Station, then travelled down 
 the line on the first train.
