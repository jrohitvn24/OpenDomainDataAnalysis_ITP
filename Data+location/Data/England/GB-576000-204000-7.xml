		<title>07DANBURY PALACE (CONTINUED)</title>
		<content> The  architecture of the palace is    
 Mock Tudor.The palace is made of red  
 brick. The turrets make it look like a
 castle.The tall chimneys climb towards
 the blue sky.Ivy has been grown on the
 wall and around the windows.There are 
 lots of bushes and trees at the front 
 of the building,built into a          
 continuous pattern.It has paths       
 between each bush and tree.The bushes 
 go up and down just like the turrets  
 on the palace roof.Around the back    
 garden there is a high wall made of   
 brick.At the front of the garden there
 is an avenue of oak trees.Inside the  
 building there is a beautiful stone   
 staircase going through the house.    
 The palace building has 30 rooms. In  
 the residential extension there are 76
 bedrooms and lots of other rooms as   
 well.That is why Danbury Palace has   
 its role as the Management Centre.    </content>
