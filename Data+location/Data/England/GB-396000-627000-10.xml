		<title>10Wooler Common</title>
		<content> To the west of Wooler the land is     
 quite hilly as you go towards Cheviot.
 The moorland is used for a mixture of 
 sheep farming and forestry.In 1980,200
 acres of moorland and rough grazing   
 were planted with trees by the Forest-
 ry Commission.The programme for the   
 80's is to plant 25 species of trees- 
 12 species of hardwood and 15 species 
 of softwood.Groups of hardwood will be
 planted aound the forest area and the 
 infill will be with softwood.Suitable 
 areas for wildlife will be established
 away from picnic places.There will be 
 forest walks,ponds and car parking    
 facilities.                           
 . Wooler Common already has picnic    
 areas and two pond areas are now well 
 established.It is a popular place for 
 walking,particularly at the week-ends.
