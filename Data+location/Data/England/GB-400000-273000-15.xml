		<content> This is a private Sports Club and     
 offers squash, badminton and tennis to
 the local people.   A person can join 
 one or more of the sports and the     
 subscription fee is approximately Â£45 
 per year for each sport.   A family   
 membership covers a family for all    
 sports.                               
 Teenagers and children use the        
 facilities as there is coaching       
 provided for them and their membership
 fees are less than for adults.        
 The sports club teams play in local   
 leagues around the county.            
 It is a very popular local centre for 
 recreation.
