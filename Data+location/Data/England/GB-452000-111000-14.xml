		<content>      The Curdridge Post Office and    
 Village Stores was built in 1900 when 
 it was the front room of a house. The 
 present Postmistress has lived there  
 since 1967 and has made 3 extensions. 
      She receives money from the Head 
 Postmaster in Southampton to pay out  
 benefits.  Each week she has to pay   
 Child Allowance, Old Age Pension, and 
 she pays Unemployment Benefit once a  
 fortnight.  She sells stamps (postage 
 stamps, first day covers, T.V. and    
 telephone saving stamps) and Postal   
 Orders.                               
      The Postmistress also runs the   
 only Village Store.  She buys most of 
 her stock from Nurdin and Peacock at  
 Eastleigh.  She has to price the stock
 and put it on the shelves.  She also  
 has to keep accounts and work out VAT 
 and TAX.  She enjoys her life and     
 would not wish to leave Curdridge.    </content>
