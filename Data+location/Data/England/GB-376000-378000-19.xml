		<title>19MOBBERLEY'S CLAY INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>      Off Hall Lane is situated one    
  of Mobberley's small industries, the 
 domed-topped furnaces of the Bradley  
 family business.  Three generations of
 the Bradley family have been involved.
 Grandfather and father of Mr. Clifford
 Bradley made bricks at the larger     
 brickworks in Small Lane, until the   
 clay came to an end in the 1930's.    
 Now the business in Hall Lane produces
 plant pots and drain pipes.  The      
 potter's wheel is being superseded by 
 machinery for he can only turn out    
 1500 pots per day as against 6000 by  
 machine. Clay plant pots and drain    
 pipes are sent to all parts of the    
 country and are remaining popular with
 traditional gardeners who prefer clay 
 pots to plastic ones.
