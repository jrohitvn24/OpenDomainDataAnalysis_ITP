		<title>01TEDSTONE DELAMERE DISTRICT</title>
		<content> This is a rural area on the borders of
 Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire 5 miles
 from Bromyard &amp; 12 miles from         
 Worcester. To the North is the large  
 village of Clifton-upon-Teme and to   
 the South the village of Whitbourne,  
 where Post Offices, shops, butchers,  
 Doctors' surgeries, garages and petrol
 are available. Two ridges of fertile  
 farmland are divided by the steep     
 sided valley of the Sapey Brook which 
 joins the River Teme above Knightsford
 Bridge. The highest point is 600 ft at
 Moorsfield. The major part of the land
 is used for grazing and much is arable
 interspersed with cared for woodland  
 and coverts. Tedstone Delamere is the 
 main parish with a 700 yr old church  
 of St James. Hunting &amp; shooting are   
 chief recreations with other interests
 catered for in nearby villages.
