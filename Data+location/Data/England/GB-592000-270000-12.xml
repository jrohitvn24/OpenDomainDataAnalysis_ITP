		<title>12IXWORTH BROWNIES</title>
		<content>The Brownies meet at Ixworth Middle    
School on Wednesdays from 6.00pm to    
7.15pm. We play games and sing songs.  
We go on pack holidays and have outings
to nice places. We have to go on a     
coach.                                 
Our uniform is a brown cotton dress and
a brown bobble hat. We have a brown    
belt and a purse fastened to it.       
We do pocket books. They are called    
pocket books because you should keep   
them in your pocket.The Brownies have  
been going on for 75 years now. I have 
been in the Brownies for 2 years so I  
am a seconder. This means I am second  
in charge of a group. A sixer is in    
charge of the whole group.             
The favourite game we play is called   
Hedgehogs.You put your hands over your 
eyes and the others hide. Two people   
have to find everybody else. When you  
find them you say their name.          </content>
