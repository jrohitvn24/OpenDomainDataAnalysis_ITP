		<title>07The Corn Drier.</title>
		<content>  Mr. Laming took us to see the corn   
 drier on his farm. It is a big        
 building made from asbestos with large
 sliding doors at the front. Inside it 
 is divided into two halves with a     
 tunnel between. In one half there was 
 barley and the other wheat.           
  When the crop has been collected from
 the fields it is taken into the corn  
 drier. Before it is put on the floor  
 some metal boxes with holes in them   
 are connected to the tunnel. These are
 layed across the floor and the seed is
 put on top. Then air is blown through 
 to dry the crop. When the crop is sold
 Mr. Laming uses a tractor to load the 
 seed onto lorries but he has to be    
 careful not to pick up the metal boxes
 too. He told us that newer corn driers
 have boxes that fit in channels in the
 floor. Mr. Laming sells most of his   
 crops to Spillers in Gainsborough.    </content>
