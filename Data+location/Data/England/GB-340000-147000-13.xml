		<title>13EMPLOYMENT IN WEDMORE AREA</title>
		<content>   Many of those living in the Wedmore 
 area{travel to work}in the cities and 
 towns nearby e.g. Bristol, Wells,     
 Street and Cheddar. Here they are     
 employed in business or in office and 
 factory work. Blackford in particular 
 has become a{dormitary village.       
   Those who remain to work in the     
 vicinity of Wedmore are employed in   
{agriculture}or the{small businesses}of
 the village. These include            
 shopkeeping, building, carpentry,     
 roofing, motor engineering, and a     
 leather goods company. Therefore many 
 are{self_employed}and often young     
 people leaving school begin to work   
 with their parents. There are some    
 leavers who have not yet found work,  
 but unemployment is not a great       
 problem.                              
   A large number of{retired}people    
 live in the villages.                 </content>
