		<content> OUR SCHOOL IS WELL OVER 100 YEARS     
 OLD.IT IS A VERY BIG BUILDING BUILT   
 MAINLY OF BRICK BUT WITH EXTRA        
 CLASSROOMS BUILT OF WOOD ON THE SAME  
 SITE.   THERE IS A SCHOOL KITCHEN     
 WHERE WE HAVE SCHOOL LUNCH PROVIDED.  
 REALLY THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS WITHIN   
 ONE BECAUSE THERE IS AN INFANT SCHOOL 
 ON THE SITE AS WELL.  CHILDREN START  
 IN THE NURSERY AND GO TO THE INFANT   
 SCHOOL WHEN THEY ARE 5 YEARS OLD, THEN
 WHEN THEY ARE 7 THEY COME TO OUR      
 SCHOOL.   AT 11 YEARS WE ALL LEAVE AND
 GO TO THE 'GRANGE' COMPREHENSIVE      
 SCHOOL.   IN SEPTEMBER  1985 THE      
 INFANT AND JUNIOR SCHOOLS ARE JOINING 
 TOGETHER AS ONE.   WE HOPE THERE WILL 
 BE A NEW BUILDING HOUSING BOTH SCHOOLS
 SOON.
