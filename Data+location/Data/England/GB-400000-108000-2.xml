		<title>02LIFE IN RURAL DORSET</title>
		<content> Some people from scattered homes      
 are employed on local farms or in     
 woods. There are small self-employed  
 units, but most commute to nearby     
 towns for work &amp; entertainment. Many  
 women have part-time jobs. Children   
 travel{by bus to school.}A private    
 bus company provides a sketchy service
 but most people think that at least 1 
 car is essential. Many elderly feel   
 compelled to move to town when{ill}   
{health}dictates that they can no      
 longer drive -{churches, doctors &amp;}   
{shopping all being out of the area.}  
 Many hunt, shoot &amp; fish, while        
 youngsters enjoy BMX &amp; motor sports in
 adjoining areas. Women's Institutes,  
 whist and bingo can be attended in    
 nearby village halls, gardening &amp;     
 education classes fill time. Several  
 residents take an active part in Local
 Government &amp; conservation issues.     </content>
