		<title>07The Southdown Fair - 1</title>
		<content>    The Southdown Fair is owned and run
 by the {Harris}family, being we       
 believe the last'true'family-run fair 
 in Sussex today.The Harris' have lived
 in Ashington since 1907, in caravans, 
 on 2.4 acres of land on which they    
 store their Fair. Their grandfather   
 started the Fair around 1870 and his  
 son carried it on. The whole family   
 help run the Fair,{Robert Harris,}the 
 manager, his four brothers{John, Ted, 
{Douglas and Fred.}Robert's wife and   
 three sons also help as do other      
 members of the immediate family.      
    The Fair grew bigger after the 1st 
 World War when the 'Galloping Horses' 
 arrived; the same ride remains today  
 as the oldest of 14 rides and         
 sideshows at the Fair.                
    The biggest change since the 2nd   
 W.W. has been from steam to diesel.
