      The great barn was built about   
 700 years ago and stands to the west  
 of Leigh Court.  It is a fine example 
 of{'building on crucks',}having eleven
 crucks - some still with original     
 wooden pegs.  It is sadly in need of  
 restoration and the wattle and daub   
 has been replaced by bricks, planking 
 and corrugated sheeting.  The red tile
 roof has hipped ends and is popularly 
 reputed to extend to one acre.  There 
 are five doors, properly called{'cart 
{doors'.}It is approximately 40 metres 
 long, 10 metres wide and 9 metres     
 high.  The crucks are 3.9 metres      
 apart.  Inside there is a cider press,
 but today the barn is used to house   
 sheep and farm machinery.
