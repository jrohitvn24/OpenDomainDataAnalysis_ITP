		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO FENLAND</title>
		<content> Our region includes the northern parts
 of{Leverington}and{Gorefield, Fitton  
{End}and much of the village of{Newton.
 It is essentially a{flat farming}area,
 lying to the North-West of{Wisbech.   
 The land is mainly rich,{fertile      
{fenland}silt and a wide range of      
{agricultural}and{horticultural}crops  
 are grown.Situated on the drier side  
 of the country, with a moderate       
 rainfall and a good sunshine record,  
 the air is clean and bracing with sea 
 breezes from The Wash.Although much of
 the work-force now concentrates on the
 light industries offered in and around
 Wisbech,the community still retains   
 its strong links with the land,by     
 virtue of casual{fruit-picking}and    
 numerous allotments.Despite the lack  
 of scenic beauty,the region still has 
 plenty to offer.
