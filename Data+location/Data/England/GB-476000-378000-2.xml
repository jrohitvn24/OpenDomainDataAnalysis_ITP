		<content> Many pupils live on the Woodbeck      
 Estate, and travel about a mile to    
 school.It is a housing estate for     
 people who work at Rampton Hospital.My
 dad works at the hospital as a male   
 nurse. The hospital is a special      
 hospital for people who are criminally
 insane or who need protecting from    
 themselves .There are also  some      
 Mentally Handicapped patients there.  
 It is a security hospital sothe       
 patient areas are fenced off and they 
 cannot leave the hospital unless      
 escorted. Over 1,000 people work at   
 the hospital,some as nurses,others as 
 ancillary workers,office workers,     
 occupational therapists,              
 doctors,social workers and also
