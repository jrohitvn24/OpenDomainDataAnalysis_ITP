		<title>19RIDING FOR THE DISABLED</title>
		<content> At{Scropton riding school}they have   
 about{27 horses.}They have to be quiet
 because they have handicapped children
 that come to the school.  The riding  
 school is meant for{handicapped       
 children. There are{four full time    
{workers}and one on a youth training   
 scheme.They work from 8.00 in a       
 morning until 5.30 at night. When the 
 handicapped children are riding they  
 sometimes need two people per horse,  
 one to lead them and one to hold them 
 on the horse or pony.                 
   The riding school was opened on June
 23 1978 by Princess Anne.             
   Half of the ponies go out at night, 
 and the rest stay in.The biggest      
 horse in the stables stands at 17.3   
 hh, and the smallest in the stables   
 is a little Shetland.
