 the parishes of Lydham and More. It is
 an{Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty

 out of the area to meet their needs   
 socially and educationally and to do  
 shopping.{Farming}is the main use of  
 the land. There are large farms and   
 small holdings. More Quarry and       
 concrete block factory provided jobs  
 until closure 10 yrs ago. The Dolerite
 stone was excellent for road making   
 because of its hardness. The area is  
 of interest to the geologist,
