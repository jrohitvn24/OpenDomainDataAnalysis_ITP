		<title>13ALL SAINT'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Church at Souldrop falls in the   
 parish of Knotting and Souldrop and is
 administered by the vicar of          
 Sharnbrook. {Morning services}are held
 every Sunday at 9am when communion is 
 usually celebrated.  There is an      
 afternoon service every fourth Sunday 
 in the month.  In the days when it was
 an estate village, everyone was       
 expected to go, but{attendance}now is 
 usually only about 17 to 20 people.   
 (The car and television have altered  
 village life considerably in recent   
 years - there is not the same         
 community feeling.)                   
                                       
 The church tower dates from the 13th  
 century.  The Church was rebuilt in   
 1861 and re-opened on Trinity Sunday. 
{Feast Sunday}was a major village event
 held for many years on Trinity Sunday.
