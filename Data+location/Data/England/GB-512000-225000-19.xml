		<title>19THE LOCAL HISTORY OF OFFLEY.</title>
		<content> The elderly residents of Offley recall
 that as children they used to help    
 their mothers with the straw plaiting.
 The straw plaiting was a cottage      
 industry supplying the Luton factories
 with long plaits which were then made 
 into the once famous straw boaters and
 bonnets.                              
  At the beginning of the century life 
 in Offley was hard for the residents, 
 most of whom earned their living on   
 the land or as servants to the local  
 gentry,they supplemented their small  
 incomes by straw plaiting.Hitchin was 
 the market town and the herdsmen would
 rise at 02.00 hours to drive their    
 cattle to market.In Hitchin they      
 recall the vile smell of the tannery  
 the scent of the lavender shop and the
 sweet savour of malt from the brewery.
 They looked forward to walking into   
 Hitchin and the Sunday School outing. </content>
