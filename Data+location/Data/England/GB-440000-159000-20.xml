		<content> At 7.30 the radio comes on and wakes  
 me up.I get dressed and have my       
 breakfast then at 8.30 Joanne and Emma
 come round and we walk to school. We  
 walk in the playground for the bell to
 go.The bell goes at 9.00. We go in and
 hang our bags up then we have         
 assembly. After assembly we have      
 project till 10.30 which is playtime. 
 we usually play French elastic or     
 chase. The bell goes at 10.55 and we  
 have Fletcher Maths. At 12.00 we have 
 lunch and a break till 1.00. Then we  
 go swimming at the Clere School. The  
 water is very cold. When we come back 
 from swimming we have playtime from   
 2.15 to 2.35. After play we do        
 project again till 3.30 then school   
 ends and we go home.
