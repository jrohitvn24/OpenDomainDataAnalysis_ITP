		<title>17The changing landscape</title>
		<content> Future development of the area will be
 extensive as the new city expands.    
 There are plans for a senior school   
 and 2 first schools, a shopping       
 precinct, sports centre, a prison and 
 several thousand housesfor Shenley    
 Church End alone. Great advances are  
 anticipated in construction and       
 heating of housing in the Energy Park.
 The prison to be built between Oakhill
 and Shenley Woods seems to be the most
 controversial development only for    
 those living within a very close      
 range. The village children do not    
 want lots of houses in the green      
 fields now surrounding them, but want 
 new shops and playgrounds. Older      
 villagers feel sad that the character 
 of the area will change with theinflux
 of so many people. The lane linking   
 the villages will become a seperate   
 enclave within the grid system.       </content>
