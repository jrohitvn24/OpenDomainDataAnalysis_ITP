		<content>{Local History. }For three generations 
 the Iron Works have been in the same  
 family.The anvil now used came from   
 the original Forge and Smithy.They    
 have many antique firebacks,some      
 dating from the fifteenth and sixtenth
 century.                              
{Art and Craft.}Firebacks and ornaments
 can be made to traditional designs,or 
 to the buyers' own                    
 specifications.Individual weathervane 
 motifs are designed by the owner and  
 welded to the traditional weathervane 
 shape.
