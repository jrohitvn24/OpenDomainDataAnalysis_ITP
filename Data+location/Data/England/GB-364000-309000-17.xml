		<title>17A Sponsored Walk</title>
		<content>   It is now common practice for       
 schools to raise money for capital    
 expenditure by staging fund_raising   
 events.                               
   We,at Hadley Junior,were recently   
 faced with such a problem.We wished to
 upgrade our coumputers' storage system
 from tape cassettes to Floppy discs.  
 The problem,of course,was the Â£200+   
 which would be needed.                
   Two members of staff decided to     
 enter a local{'fun walk'}and asked the
 children to obtain sponsorship on     
 their behalf.                         
   The response from the children was  
 overwhelming,over Â£300 was raised,    
 enabling the school to buy two disc   
 drives,a supply of floppy discs and   
 small cabinets to keep them safe.     
 In addition we were able to buy 3     
 adventure programs and some much      
 needed books for the library.         </content>
