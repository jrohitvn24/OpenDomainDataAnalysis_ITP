		<content>    500 metres outside Wadworth there  
 is a motorway junction for the A1M and
 M18 motorways. There is a very large  
 roundabout with bridges. If you go    
 down White Cross Lane, you go under   
 some of the bridges.On the M18 one way
 goes to Hull one to Sheffield. The A1 
 motorway goes from Edinburgh to       
 London. The motorway altogether looks 
 like a spaghetti junction. A motorway 
 is a very big road on which cars      
 travel at 70 miles an hour. The A1M   
 has two lanes and is the oldest of the
 roads and is called the Doncaster     
 By-Pass because the main A1 once went 
 through Doncaster. This always caused 
 traffic jams. The M18 has three lanes 
 and was only made ten years ago. There
 are no service areas on the M18. With 
 the Doncaster By Pass there are       
 services at both ends.
