		<title>09SHOPPING IN MITCHELDEAN</title>
		<content>    There are about a dozen shops in   
 Mitcheldean, several of them grocers  
 and general stores. There are also two
 butchers, a shoe shop, a dress shop, a
 bread shop, newsagent and a fish and  
 chip shop. There is a Post Office and 
 a bank open 3 days per week.          
 Mitcheldean lacks both a chemist and a
 hardware store, but both are found in 
 Drybrook. Most people seemed happy    
 with the local shops, and used them   
 quite frequently. Mitcheldean shops   
 close on Saturday afternoons, when    
 many people go shopping in larger     
 towns. A survey amongst a group of    
 children at Mitcheldean Primary School
 showed that Gloucester was the most   
 popular shopping centre for about 75  
 per cent of the families, with the    
 remainder choosing the smaller, but   
 closer towns of Cinderford and        
 Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire.         </content>
