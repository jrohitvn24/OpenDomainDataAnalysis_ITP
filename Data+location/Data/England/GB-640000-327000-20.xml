 Again because this is a coastal area a
 great variety of birds find their way 
 into local gardens,especialy at Spring
 and Autumn migrations.For example,    
 parties of Goldcrests are usually seen
 in spring,and in severe weather Snipe,
 Water Rail,Redshank and Lapwing have  
 all been reported to have come into   
 gardens from their usual territory.   
 Butterflies are numerous,the more     
 common species such as Red Admiral,   
 Peacock,Brimstone and Tortoiseshell   
 are always present.Painted Ladies are 
 sometimes seen and in the past Swallow
 tail and Camberwell Beauty have been  
 reported.In most years Humming-bird,  
 Hawkmoth are present.Despite the      
 reported general decline of the frog  
 and toad population the area seems to 
 have its fair share of both,and adders
 which are plentiful in the dunes.     </content>
