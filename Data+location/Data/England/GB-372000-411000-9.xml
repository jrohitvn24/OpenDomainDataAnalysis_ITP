		<content> Much of the area is covered by urban  
 recreational open space.              
 The Jumbles Countryside Park is found 
 in the northern part.                 
 Elsewhere there is a variety of parks 
 and other amenities.Longsight Park is 
 used by football and rounders teams   
 and bowling greens are found there    
 and at the Royal Oak Inn,Bradshaw.    
 Private cricket clubs exist at Castle 
 Hill and Bradshaw and tennis courts   
 are also found at the latter.         
 There are no sports centres,however,  
 and residents have to travel out of   
 the area to find these facilities.    
 There are many public houses along the
 main roads.Walsh's Institute is used  
 for many indoor leisure activities eg 
 evening classes,dancing and luncheon  
 clubs.                                
 There are three Scout or Guide huts in
 the area.                             </content>
