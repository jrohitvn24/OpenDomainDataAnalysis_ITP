		<content> We drove along every road of our area 
 and did a survey of all the houses    
 Most were old,but a few were new.     
 We went through{Tisbury}especially to 
 see some modern houses that were being
 built.If we had done this survey two  
 years ago they would not have existed,
 so they're shown{blue.}Most of the old
 houses were made of{stone,}and many of
 them were{thatched.}Many of the really
 modern ones were made of{brownish     
{reddish brick.
