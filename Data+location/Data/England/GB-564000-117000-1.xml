 area of habitation within our chosen  
 area.Dallington is a small Wealden    
 village approximately 500 feet above  
 sea level.There are about 220 people  
 on the electoral rollwith a large     
 element of elderly inhabitants.Before 
 the Norman Conquest it was called     
 Deallantum meaning the enclosure of   
 Dealla's people.It is a typical Sussex
 village,being one long street.The     
 B2096 is the only "main" road crossing
 the block.It links Dallington with the
 market towns of Battle( 7milesS.E.)and
 Heathfield (6 miles N.W.).Traffic flow
 through the area is low,but contains a
 high proportion of Heavy Goods        
 Vehicles and farm vehicles.The whole  
 area is given over mainly to dairy and
 arable farming and there are large    
 areas of coniferous and deciduous     
 forests.The soil is mainly clay .     </content>
