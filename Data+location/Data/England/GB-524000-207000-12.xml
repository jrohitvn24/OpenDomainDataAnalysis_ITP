{ The Essendon Society is to           
 protect and preserve Essendon village.
 It was started in 1971 when a lady    
 built a garage in the middle of the   
 village. People thought it spoilt the 
 view and got together to form the     
 Essendon Society. They meet about once
 every six weeks in each others houses.
 With urgent matters a special meeting 
 is called. The secretary keeps a      
 record of everything discussed at the 
 meetings in a minute book. Anybody can
 join and the cost is 25p for each     
 household. The Society collects old   
 photos of the area and has planted    
 trees in the village. In 1985 they    
 were fighting a proposed extension to 
 the gypsy site at Holwell.The gypsies 
 think the newcomers will take away    
 their jobs and they would prefer the  
 site to stay at its present size.     </content>
