		<content> Before our school was built,the old   
 Post Office was the school.Two old    
 houses opposite the old Post Office   
 used to be the village Pub.The village
 once had a Blacksmith whose cottage   
 still stands today.Many of the old    
 farms have barns which have been      
 modernised and made into houses,there 
 are several farms in our area.The old 
 Post Office is now a nice little      
 cottage, and we now have a Post Office
 and Shop at the bottom of the village.
 Recently our school was given a       
 swimming pool, when nearby Lee Moor   
 School closed down,it is well used by 
 us all.
