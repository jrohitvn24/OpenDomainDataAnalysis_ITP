     At{Lordshill Shopping Centre}there
 is a pub called the Mountbatten, so we
 went along to ask the landlord how it 
 got its name. He told us that the pub 
 was built just after{Lord Mountbattens
 death. The family gave them permission
 to name the pub after him. While we   
 were there we asked him the most      
 popular drink for men. This was{lager}
 and for women,{vodka.}Favourite with  
 the children was{coca-cola.}He told us
 that he sells about{500 gallons of    
{lager}a week, that's 4000 pints. The  
 busiest evening for the landlord is   
 Friday, but also lots of people drop  
 in for a drink after they've been     
 shopping. The pub is open from 6pm to 
 11pm weekdays and from 7pm to 10.30 pm
 on Sunday.                            </content>
