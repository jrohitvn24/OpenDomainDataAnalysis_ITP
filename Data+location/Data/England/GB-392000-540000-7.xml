      There are nine separate farms in 
 the Rookhope area, from Redburn Farm  
 on the north side of Rookhope to North
 Hanging Wells on the south side of the
 village.                              
      As this area is at least twelve  
 hundred feet above sea level all the  
 farms are known as Hill Farms-mainly  
 comprising of suckler beef and        
 Swaledale sheep, although one farm    
 also keeps a dairy herd. Milk from    
 this is both sold locally and         
 collected by the Milk Marketing Board.
      Most of the farmers manage to    
 make a living from their land alone,  
 although one or two have other paid   
 employment.
