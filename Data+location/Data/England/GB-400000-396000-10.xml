		<title>10PAST MEMORIES OF SCHOOL 2</title>
		<content> According to the people we interviewed
 Fridays were the days to looked       
 forward to. This was because cooking  
 and woodwork were taught. But unlike  
 today   cooking was only for the girls
 and woodwork for the boys.            
   The headmaster was then the most    
 important man in the village and all  
 the children feared him.              
   The leaving age in those days was   
 14. Mrs Clayton said she went to the  
 Grammar School at 15.                 
   We were told that Miss Connie       
 Marshall was a young teacher who was  
 kind to the children. They used to    
 have a tennis court but it was a      
 privilege and only the older children 
 went on it. They used to do drill     
 every morning. This was exercises.    
   We decided that perhaps schooling   
 today is better.
