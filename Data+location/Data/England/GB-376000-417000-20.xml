		<title>20THE RIVER IRWELL</title>
		<content> The{River Irwell}rises one and a half 
 miles north of the town of Bacup,is   
 joined as it flows through Rawtenstall
 by the Limy Water and in Irwell Vale  
 by the River Ogden,and flows through  
 our block from North to South. After  
 passing through Salford and           
 Manchester,it eventually joins the    
 River Mersey and enters the sea off   
 Liverpool.The villages of Edenfield   
 and Stubbins are situated on the      
 valley sides in the river's middle    
 course.The river contributed to the   
 industrial development which took     
 place during the nineteenth century   
 and still suffers from pollution from 
 factories and mills along its course. 
 In recent years several organisations,
 such as the{Rossendale Groundwork     
{Trust},have tried to improve the      
 quality of the river and its          
 surroundings.                         </content>
