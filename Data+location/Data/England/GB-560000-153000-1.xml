		<title>01The Bourne Valley</title>
		<content> The Bourne Valley dominates the       
{landscape}of this area.  The River    
 Bourne flows south through its        
 v-shaped valley lined with orchards,  
 hop gardens and fields containing a   
 variety of arable crops.              
                                       
 The valley has been settled since the 
 Bronze Age and there is evidence of   
 Iron Age, Roman and Saxon settlement. 
                                       
 In recent years the{landscape}has     
 changed a lot.  Many orchards and hop 
 gardens have given way to arable      
 crops.  Hedges have been grubbed out  
 to make larger fields more suited to  
 large machinery.  Many oast houses    
 remain, but few are now processing    
 hops.  Most have been converted into  
 living accommodation.
