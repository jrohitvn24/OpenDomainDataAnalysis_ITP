		<content> This 4km by 3km block consists mostly 
 of farmland with the Hemel Hempstead  
 new town area of Chaulden and the old 
 village of Bourne End as residential  
 area.There has been no very recent    
 development because the               
 non-residential area is Greenbelt.Most
 of Chaulden was built in the early    
 1950s,as Hemel Hempstead was          
 designated a new town in 1949.        
 Crossing the block are major transport
 routes:the Grand Union Canal,the A41  
 road which runs from Birmingham to    
 London and the Glasgow to Euston      
 railway line.                         
 There are a great variety of schools  
 in the block,state and feepaying,     
 infant and junior and a special       
 school.
