		<title>10A Publican.</title>
		<content>   Mr. John Fitzgerald is the landlord 
 of the Horse and Jockey public house  
 at Curbridge.This old pub., which     
 dates back over 100 yrs., is built on 
 the banks of the River Hamble. Before 
 coming here he was in the Royal Navy. 
  His day starts at 6 a.m. and finishes
 at 11.30 p.m. He has 1 rest day if he 
 is lucky. He enjoys the licensed trade
 and has between 2 and 3,000 customers 
 in a week. His busiest times are from 
 Easter to mid Sept. with the weekends 
 being the busiest. He depends more on 
 customers from out of the area than   
 locals. The mens most popular drink is
 H.S.B.,a very strong local beer. Wine 
 is most popular with women. He sells  
 snacks and bar food, but children are 
 not allowed inside until they are 18. 
   If he was not a publican he would   
 like to own a fish and chip shop.
