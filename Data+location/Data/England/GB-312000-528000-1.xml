		<title>01Cockermouth - an overview 1</title>
		<content>  Our survey area includes most of     
 Cockermouth and the farmland to the   
 east and south of the town.           
 Cockermouth is a small market town of 
 some 7000 people at the confluence of 
 the rivers Derwent and Cocker in the  
 Allerdale District of Cumbria. The    
 major industries are in shoe and boot 
 making, engine seals and brewing.     
 Cockermouth is the centre for a       
 predominately dairy farming area, with
 a two-day livestock market and        
 abbatoir.                             
 The oldest part of the town lies on   
 the southern bank of the River        
 Derwent, whilst the major post-war    
 housing development, both private and 
 Council, lies to the south and        
 south-west. Many people commute to    
 work in the west coast towns, Keswick 
 and at the B.N.F.L. Works at          
 Sellafield, south of Egremont.        </content>
