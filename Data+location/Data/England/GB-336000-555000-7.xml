		<title>07INDUSTRIAL CARLISLE</title>
		<content>  The first major industries in the    
 area involved textiles.In the 18th    
 century,spinning was a cottage        
 industry in the villages outside the  
 city,and the larger works grew up in  
 the 19th century.Much of the city's   
 industrial development was concentr-  
 ated in Caldewgate.Now,Caldewgate is a
 small area but very noisy.There are a 
 lot of factories,like the milk        
 processing plant.About 100 metres from
 our house there is a scrapyard and it 
 has a giant electromagnet and 500     
 metres away is the United Biscuits fac
 tory.Now that the summer has come     
 there is a lot more traffic and the   
 road that leads onto the A74 at the   
 main roundabout passes through        
 Caldewgate and causes a lot of noise.
