		<title>10Village Life. Mr. Lidgett.</title>
		<content>  We went to visit Mr. and Mrs. Lidgett
 for our Domesday Project. They live at
 Green Field House in Heapham. Their   
 home includes 7 acres of land. One    
 part is used for digging and planting 
 and the rest are fields.              
  Mr. Lidgett was born in Sringthorpe  
 and went to the village school until  
 he was 13 years old. When he was a    
 young boy his father owned a pig. When
 he killed the pig he blew the pig's   
 bladder up and gave it to Mr. Lidgett 
 to use as a football. Before Mr.      
 Lidgett went to school in the morning 
 he had to drive some cows down a long 
 lane. One day something came and      
 frightened the cows and Mr. Lidgett   
 was late for school and had the cane  
 on his hand for being late.           
  Mr. and Mrs. Lidgett have 3 sons and 
 4 grandchildren but they have moved   
 out of the area.      { See next page.</content>
