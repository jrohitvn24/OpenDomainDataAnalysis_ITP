		<title>16The Abbey.</title>
		<content> Little now remains of the old Priory  
 and Abbey, although the old fish      
 ponds, now largely overgrown are still
 in evidence near the railway bridge.  
 The foundation date of the Priory is  
 uncertain, although it is known that  
 the Prior in 1442 was called William. 
 By the end of the 15th century, the   
 status of the Priory had changed to   
 that of an Abbey, and in the years    
 before the Dissolution it became very 
 wealthy.  In 1539, the Abbey was      
 dissolved and the buildings and lands 
 passed into the hands of Sir Maurice  
 Berkeley, Standard Bearer to King     
 Henry VIII.  The Berkeley family made 
 the Abbey into a fine mansion and in  
 1620, King Charles I was entertained  
 there.  After the serious fire in     
 1763, it passed to the Hoare family,  
 who owned it until 1786, when it fell 
 into disrepair, before collapsing.    </content>
