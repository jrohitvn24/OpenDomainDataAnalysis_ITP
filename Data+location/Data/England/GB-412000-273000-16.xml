		<content> We play lots of games at Cheswick     
 Green and one of our favourites is    
 called Semi to Semi Speedie.We use a  
 netball pitch to play on and use the  
 two semi-circles at each end of the   
 pitch as the dens.One person is on at 
 the start of the game.All team        
 members start in one semi-circle and  
 everyone has to get to the other      
 semi-circle without being caught by   
 the person who is on.When you are     
 caught you join the person who is     
 on.The game continues until everyone  
 is caught and the winner is the last  
 person to be caught.Each game lasts   
 about five to ten minutes and is lots 
 of fun.
