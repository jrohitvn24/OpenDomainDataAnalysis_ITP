		<title>03POLICING IN NEWHAVEN</title>
		<content> The present police station is in      
 South Road, built over a Roman Villa  
 and opened in 1976.  Before this, in  
 1890 there was a police station in    
 Dacre Road.                           
                                       
 At present there is an Inspector      
 in charge and 4 Sergeants plus a      
 number of Constables.  Newhaven and   
 Seaford police work together on a     
 rota, inter-changing with each other. 
 They both have mobile and foot patrols
 known as "Response Units".  Sergeant  
 Brown is the liaison officer with     
 Schools.  Locally committed crimes    
 include burglaries, car thefts, shop- 
 lifting, vandalism and assaults.  All 
 have increased since 1984 together    
 with a worsening drugs problem and 91 
 road accidents.  Criminal cases are   
 tried at Lewes Assize Courts.
