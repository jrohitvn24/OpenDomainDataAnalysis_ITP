     The Church of England is the only 
 religion represented in the census    
 area. A curate is in charge of the two
 churches in this area. The churches   
 are part of a larger group under the  
 overall charge of a vicar. Services   
 are held at different times on Sundays
 at Albury and Little Hadham by the    
 curate who lives at Albury. About     
 4%-9% attend services on Sundays, more
 go to the mid-morning service than the
 early one. A formal service in the    
 village hall attracts more            
 people, especially the old who can not
 get up to the church, which is half a 
 mile from the main village, and also  
 by young families.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
