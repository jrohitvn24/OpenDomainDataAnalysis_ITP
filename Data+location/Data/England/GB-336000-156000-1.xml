		<title>01The area in general.</title>
		<content>    Our area is basically centred      
 around the Lox Yeo River Valley, which
 is situated in the extreme south of   
 the County of Avon. It is almost      
 exactly divided in half by the M5     
 motorway.                             
    The area is mostly farm land. There
 are only a few villages which  are    
{Christon, Barton} and the outskirts   
 of Hutton. There is one church at     
 Christon.                             
     Our area also includes a part of  
{Banwell,}which includes Banwell bone  
 caves, and Banwell monument.          
     Most of the villages in the area  
 are very small. Christon has a        
 population of 36, most of who work    
 either on the farms, work in Bristol  
 or nearby towns.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
