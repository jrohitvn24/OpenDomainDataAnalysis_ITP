		<title>03Tourism in Yewdale</title>
		<content>{Tourism}This has been an important    
 part of the local economy since the   
 days of the Lakes poets.  Tourists are
 attracted by the rugged, glaciated    
 scenery and this is found in our block
 in the form of U-shaped valleys       
{(Yewdale),}mountain peaks{(Wetherlam  
 and{The Old Man)}and hanging valleys  
 containing waterfalls, e.g. the{"White
{Lady"}(306992).                       
    {Fell walking, climbing}and{fishing
 are the most popular activities       
 followed by tourists. Accommodation   
 for them is an important source of    
 additional income to the farmers in   
 our block, as well as the main income 
 for the owners of guest houses, hotels
 and caravan sites that are to be found
 on the northern fringe of Coniston.   
 The long distance footpath, the       
{"Cumbria Way"}passes through Yewdale, 
 and is an additional attraction.      </content>
