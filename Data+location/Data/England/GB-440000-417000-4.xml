		<title>04FISHING AT NOSTELL PRIORY</title>
		<content>   One of the major pastimes in our    
 area is fishing and a very popular    
 place to fish is at Nostell Priory.   
 Nostell has three lakes covering 40   
 acres and claims to offer some of the 
 finest coarse fishing in Yorkshire.The
 lakes are surrounded by woodland and  
 rhododendrons, providing a beautiful  
 and peaceful setting. The lakes are   
 well stocked with fish including      
 roach, pike,tench, bream and perch.   
   To fish the lakes a licence and     
 a valid permit are required, which are
 obtainable from a self-employed water 
 bailiff who is responsible for the    
 upkeep of the lakes. His work includes
 keeping the lakes clean and running a 
 fishing shop, patrolling the lakes,   
 tree felling and general repairs and  
 maintenance work. Despite his workload
 he still finds time for his own       
 hobbies of fishing and gardening.     </content>
