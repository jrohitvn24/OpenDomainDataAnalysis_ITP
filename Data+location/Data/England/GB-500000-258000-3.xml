		<content> In the north east corner of the survey
 area is the Royal Aircraft            
 Establishment,at Thurleigh.This is a  
 research centre for aircraft          
 development sited on an old second    
 world war R.A.F. station.             
 The buildings are large and modern and
 being on high ground present and      
 prominent skyline feature which       
 intrudes into otherwise rural         
 landscape.                            
 Ten years ago this airfield was one of
 the prospective sites for the third   
 London Airport and as such was the    
 centre of a great deal of local       
 controversy.The remants of the protest
 campaign in the area remain as slogans
 painted on the sides of barns,bus     
 shelters and railway bridges.
