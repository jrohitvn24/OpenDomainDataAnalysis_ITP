		<title>19Burning Barn _ Totton</title>
		<content> One day a barn caught fire. Planners  
 wanted to make a Community Centre out 
 of it but I don't think they can      
 because its burnt down. It was        
 destroyed by vandals. The fire was an 
 accident but vandals destroyed tiles  
 and brickwork. The site has been      
 farmed for 1000 years.                
{Totton Teenagers Escape}: Last week on
 the Dibden Purlieu roundabout a car   
 caught fire. The occupants got out    
 very quickly but as they got out, the 
 seats caught fire. They went to get   
 help &amp; as the fire engine came, the   
 car was bursting with flames &amp;  smoke.
 Luckily the teenages were not hurt.
