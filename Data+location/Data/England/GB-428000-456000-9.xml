		<content>   Although everyone likes living in   
 Killinghall few would like to see any 
 future growth in the village. Most    
 wish to retain the smsll quiet village
 atmosphere. This would be vastly      
 improved by the building of a by-pass 
 to tale away the everincreasing       
 traffic.                              
   The bus service is used by a        
 decreasing number of people but to    
 these it is a very important service. 
   Only about a third of the village   
 class themselves as churchgoers, about
 103 being Anglicans, 50 Methodists,   
 and only three Catholics.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
