		<title>01Bromesberrow and Eastnor.</title>
		<content> The area is to be found at the        
 southern end of the Malvern Hills. It 
 comprises mainly of two large estates,
 Eastnor of 3000 acres and Bromesberrow
 of 1200 acres. The area is mainly     
 arable, grassland and rough pasture   
 farmland with areas of maintained     
 woodland scattered throughout. There  
 is also some common land and parkland.
 The landscape comprises of gently     
 rolling hillsides and rugged          
 escarpments. The population is        
 sparsely scattered in small hamlets   
 and isolated houses and farms. Narrow 
 lanes and tracks traverse the area.   
 There are very few amenities and some 
 mode of personal transport is         
 essential.
