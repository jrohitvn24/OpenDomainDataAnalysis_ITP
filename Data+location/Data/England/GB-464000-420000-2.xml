		<title>02THE SCHOOL INSPECTOR</title>
		<content> Schools in the last century were the  
 subject of continuous Inspection. As  
 the Primary School was a Methodist    
 Institution, the Inspector was usually
 a Clergyman. There are frequent       
 references in the Log Books of the    
 school to visits made by one Rev      
 George French. His main interest was  
 the TOILETS. There is an entry made in
 1877 which reads                      
 "I regret to say that I cannot        
 regard the office accommodation here  
 as satisfactory either in quality or  
 position. In the boy's one office     
 several can sit side by side and the  
 door leading to it is directly        
 infront of the Girl's part of the     
 playground. There was an unpleasant   
 smell from the Girl's place  and      
 some unhealthy liquid was making its  
 way through the wall into the yard."
