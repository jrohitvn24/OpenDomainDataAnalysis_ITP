		<title>10RADIO IN THE '20s &amp; '30s</title>
		<content> Interview by Avtar Singh and Phillip  
 Allcock.                              
 Eric is 84 and was a technician.Public
 broadcasting started in 1922 and was  
 very popular because,"You could shut  
 yourself off from the rest  of the    
 world," something you could not do    
 with a gramaphone.He made his first   
 radio from cardboard tubing and a coil
 of wire;this was connected to a       
 crystal and then to an aerial to pick 
 up signals.You listened to the prog-  
 -ramme through headphones.The main    
 problem was that moving the wireless  
 could untune the crystal  and it was  
 difficult to retune.Eric listened to  
 the radio  mostly in the evening;he   
 usually tuned into Radio Luxemburg.Ra-
 -dios today are much easier to tune   
 in;there are many more channels and   
 the range of programmes is much wider,
 according to Eric.                    </content>
