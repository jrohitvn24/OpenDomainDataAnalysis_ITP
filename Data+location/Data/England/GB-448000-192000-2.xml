		<title>02A Day In The Life Of.....</title>
		<content>    First of all in the morning I get  
 up, wash, dress and go down stairs to 
 eat my breakfast.After that I switch  
 on my{computer}and play games on it   
 for about one and a half hours.Then I 
 go round for my friend Steven and we  
 copy{computer games}from my friends.  
    By lunch time we have finished our 
 recording and we play the new games   
 until about 3.30 in the afternoon,our 
 favourite game has a helicopter in it 
 where you have to blow up a nuclear   
 reactor and land on a ship.But usually
 we play Ghostbusters where you have to
 capture lots of ghosts for money.     
    Steven usually goes home after tea 
 and I settle down to an evening       
 watching the television.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
