		<title>13Kingstag or King's Stag</title>
		<content>   Our block only contains part of this
 hamlet but it does have the village   
 name sign in it.According to the      
 County Council it is Kingstag whereas 
 the O.S. map and the parish call it   
 King's Stag. As the name implies a    
{"Beautifull and goodly White Hart"}was
 killed here to the annoyance of       
 Henry 111.                            
   The {Memorial Chapel}was built in   
 1914 to replace the 1884 one in memory
 of Lady Barbara Yeatman-Biggs by her  
 husband who was the first Bishop of   
 the newly created Coventry diocese.   
 At this time land was also given for a
 burial ground ajoining the chapel so  
 that from then Kingstag parishioners  
 are buried in the hamlet and no longer
 by the parish church at Stock.
