		<title>11ST CHADS CHURCH SUTTON C'FLD</title>
		<content>   One local parish church is that of  
 St.Chadwick or{St.Chad's.}Inside the  
 layout is of cruciform shape.         
   The outside also looks traditional  
 being of rough cut Cotswold{stone.}But
 a twentieth century{steel}frame       
 provides structural strength!         
   A side chapel was added in 1977 to  
 commemorate the{Golden Jubilee. }     
   Carved{wood}is a major feature of   
 internal decoration.A guilded reredos 
 rises on the east wall above the      
 altar.A triptych adorns this focal    
 point.The central panel colourfully   
 depicts the life of{Jesus.}This is    
 flanked by two other Biblical scenes. 
  {Music}is provided by an organ.      
   The Church serves a wider community 
 as well as the membership.For example 
 every Christmas{John Willmott School }
 pupils walk to the Church for the     
 annual{Carol Service.}                </content>
