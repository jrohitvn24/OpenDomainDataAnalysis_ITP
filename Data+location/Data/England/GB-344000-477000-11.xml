 The{Arnside Broadsheet,}a monthly     
 information leaflet compiled in the   
 village and delivered free to every   
 home, lists more than 25 local        
 organizations ranging from a "Mother  
 and Toddler Group" through sports     
 clubs (like Badminton Club) and       
 interst groups (like The Natural      
 History Society) to the "Tuesday Club"
 for the "over 60's".  The groups meet 
 in rooms at the National School, in   
 the W.I. Village Hall, in the         
 Educational Institute, in rooms       
 belonging to the churches or in club  
 rooms throughout the village.         
 There is no Cinema in the village but 
 plays are presented by Arnside Players
 from time to time.
