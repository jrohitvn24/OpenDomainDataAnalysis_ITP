		<title>05SHOPPING IN SANDY</title>
		<content>  SANDY HAS A WIDE VARIETY OF SHOPS.   
 MOST OF THE SHOPS ARE SMALL,          
 INDIVIDUAL SHOPS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE   
 THREE SUPERMARKETS. A NEW AND VERY    
 LARGE SUPERMARKET IS BEING BUILT ON   
 THE SITE OF THE RED LION PUB OPPOSITE 
 THE MARKET SQUARE.                    
  THERE ARE ONLY A FEW SHOPS ON LONDON 
 ROAD AND ST. NEOTS ROAD, MOST OF THEM 
 ARE IN THE HIGH STREET WHICH RUNS FROM
 THE BEDFORD ROAD ROUNDABOUT UP TO THE 
 STATION.                              
  PEOPLE COME FROM MANY AREAS AROUND   
 SANDY TO SHOP AND IT IS QUITE EASY TO 
 PARK YOUR CAR. THERE IS A LARGE CAR   
 PARK BEHIND SOME OF THE SHOPS IN THE  
 HIGH STREET. CARS ARE ALSO ALLOWED TO 
 PARK ON THE MARKET SQUARE WHICH IS NOT
 NOW USED FOR THE MARKET.
