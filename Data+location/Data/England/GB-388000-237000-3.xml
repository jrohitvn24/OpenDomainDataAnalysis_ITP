		<content>   Hill End, between Strensham and     
 Twyning, has about 40 scattered       
 houses. All are more than four years  
 old, one is thatched and eight were   
 built by the council. There is a small
 village green, with a telephone kiosk 
 and pillar box. There is no shop, but 
 a bus runs to Tewkesbury twice a week.
   Hill End Common is unfenced area    
 of 11 acres. A farm produces eggs for 
 a hatchery. A nursery man owns three  
 acres of land, a third of which is    
 covered by oil heated glass and       
 polythene houses. Salad vegetables and
 bedding plants are grown from seed.   
 The produce is collected and sold in  
 Hereford.                             
   A market gardener owns 22 acres and 
 grows vegetables which are started    
 under glass. He sells lettuce at Xmas 
 and takes his produce to market at    
 Cheltenham.                           </content>
