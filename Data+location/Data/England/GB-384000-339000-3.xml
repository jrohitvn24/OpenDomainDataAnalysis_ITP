		<title>03Strongford Sewage Works</title>
		<content>Strongford sewage works treats most of 
the sewage from the City of Stoke-on   
Trent.The first stage of the process   
is to rake the sewage to get all the   
rags and things like that out.Then     
the grit has to be taken out.The water 
goes into another filter so that the   
grit and the sand can be removed.Next  
it needs the grease to be got out.There
is an arm that collects all the grease 
and it is put into chambers.The        
organic waste is eaten by little       
bugs which are put into the water.     
Air is pumped into the water so that   
the bugs can survive.The sludge that   
is left is dried by sucking and        
squeezing out the water.The clean      
water then goes into the River         
Trent.There are now lots of fish in the
river because the water is so clean.
