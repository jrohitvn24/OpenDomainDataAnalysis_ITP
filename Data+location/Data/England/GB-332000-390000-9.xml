		<content>    {  A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL SAYS:       
{                                      
{ }My mum decided to move house because
 she  didn't like  walking  up and down
 stairs. We  lived  in  a flat  in  the
 middle  of  a  high  building. She was
 tired  carrying the baby up stairs all
 the  time. The house was  old and damp
 and  too  cold  for  the  baby.       
                                       
  {She  didn't like living where  there
{were no shops.We used to walk to Great
{Homer Street but it's too far to carry
{much.  Now we are near  lots of  shops
{where  she can get  everything  fresh.
{                                      
{ }We moved by  Walton  Hospital. We've
 got  a  garden  of  our own now. It is
 much better here  because  it is quiet
 and  we  have  good  neighbours.  The 
 children  are kind. I like it here and
 my  family  never want to move  again.</content>
