		<title>02A Village School in Harden</title>
		<content> Education in Harden takes place in    
 the First School, which was opened in 
 1877. An extension was added in 1971, 
 doubling its size.                    
 There are 94 children on roll aged    
 from 4 to 9, with a headmistress, 3   
 full-time teachers and 1 part-time and
 9 ancilliaries.                       
 There is a P.T.A. which organises     
 social and fund-raising events.       
 Parents are also involved in various  
 activities in school and are invited  
 to Thursday morning assemblies.       
 School trips, visits and holidays     
 take place frequently alongside the   
 usual school work. Often visitors come
 into school to broaden the children's 
 education.                            
 We are lucky to have a hard area and a
 big field to play on.
