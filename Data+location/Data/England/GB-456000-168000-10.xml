		<content> DISADVANTAGES OF LIVING IN BEENHAM.   
 Lack of shops, bus services, street   
 lights and entertainments.You need a  
 car to take part in leisure activities
 as there are very few recreational    
 facilities. Roads stay blocked long   
 after it snows. The library van calls 
 only once a fortnight. Older people   
 have to depend on delivery vans. There
 is no gas supply and frequent power   
 cuts.The local secondary school is    
 quite a distance away.                
 ADVANTAGES OF LIVING IN BEENHAM.      
 There are no riots and very little    
 vandalism.There are open spaces, woods
 and a small friendly school. There is 
 less noise,superb views with plenty of
 unspoilt land. The people are friendly
 and have plenty of places to walk.In  
 Beenham wild life is abundant. Local  
 grown vegetables, fruit and fresh eggs
 are available.                        </content>
