		<title>08BIRDS AROUND NORTH SCARLE</title>
		<content>   In North Scarle I have seen lots of 
 blackbirds. They eat bread and fat.   
 They drink milk and water. The        
 blackbirds live in the trees near all 
 the leaves. The other bird I've seen  
 is the thrush.They eat fat and bread. 
 They drink water and milk.            
   At the top of our house there is a  
 magpies nest and it has about five    
 babies in it. They eat anything and   
 drink anything.                       
   I have seen a sparrow up in our     
 tree.They like to sing songs to one   
 and other. They like to eat fat and   
 bread and they drink water.           
   We have a bird box in our garden and
 bluetits are in it and they have laid 
 about six eggs.They keep going in and 
 out the box.They eat bread and fat    
 They drink water.The babies have flown
 away now.                             
 water.                                </content>
