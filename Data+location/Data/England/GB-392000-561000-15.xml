		<content>{ The Northumbria Police}this week     
 announced plans to start neighbourhood
{Watch Schemes}in the Tynedale area.   
 Following an increase in the crime    
 rate in the region it is hoped that   
 the public will respond to the        
 initiative which has proved successful
 in other areas of the country.        
 Residents in the east end of Hexham   
 will receive questionnaires from the  
 police and their responses will be    
 analysed and correlated.The Police    
 hope that each street in the area     
 will establish a"contact point"and    
 have special constables.Eventually it 
 is hoped that the residents will      
 organise themselves and expand        
 throughout the area,but in the mean   
 while they will operate under the     
 auspices of a P.C.The organiser       
 P.C.Ibbetson said "We hope the plan   
 will be good for all-police and public</content>
