 owned by families and range from{6    
{acres to 135 acres}in size.           
  The height above sea level results   
 in{heavy rainfall, late springs}and{  
{early winters}and wind.All these      
 restrict the kinds of crops that can  
 be grown.                             
  The soil in the area is best for{    
{growing grass}so this is primarily    
 what the farmers do.The grass is used 
 to feed cows and sheep.It is also cut 
 for hay and silage which feeds the    
 animals in winter.                    
  The cows are kept as{dairy}-producing
 milk which is sold to the milk        
 marketing board and also for young    
 beasts.

 produce which are then sold at local  
 markets.
