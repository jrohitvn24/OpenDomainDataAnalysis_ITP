		<content>   The Oliver Wells school in Milton   
 Keynes is for mentally and physically 
 handicapped children.It was named     
 after a man who,after losing both his 
 legs in an accident built his own from
 metal and drove about on a motorbike  
 with a sidecar.                       
   Paul and Joy from our school have   
 been there because they have special  
 needs.Joy went there after a road     
 accident and it helped her to walk and
 talk again.Paul went there because he 
 has a problem with his balance.There  
 are physiotherapists there who helped 
 him with exercises to strengthen his  
 muscles.                              
   In my class there are about 32      
 children,but at Oliver Wells there are
 only 8_10 children in each class. The 
 headmasters name is Trevor.The pupils 
 at Oliver Wells try to make the best  
 of life despite their handicaps.      </content>
