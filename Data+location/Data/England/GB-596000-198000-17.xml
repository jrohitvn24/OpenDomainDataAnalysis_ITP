		<content>   We walked out of the village towards
 the agricultural area.The first       
 noticeable object was a water pump,   
 erected by the governors of the       
 Charter House in 1832.The pump is     
 rusty and it squeaks when trying to   
 pump water.                           
   Some of the flowers to be seen are  
 Persian Speedwell,White Dead Nettle,  
 Wild rose,Dandelion and Blackthorn.   
   Further on is the Essex Water       
 Authority which supplies Water to the 
 village.                              
   At the end of the Marsh Road,in the 
 distance were some tall chimneys,     
 probably in Kent.                     
   On the return journey,swans were    
 seen swimming in a pond,some of their 
 feathers were lying around.
