		<title>01Birker Fell</title>
		<content> The northern end of the ridge form    
 Black Combe is called Birker Fell.  It
 drops to the sea on the west, to the  
 Duddon Valley to the east and to the  
 river Esk to the north.  The main     
 summit is Yoadcastle, and Rocky Knoll,
 1597 feet above sea level.  The square
 also contains a fine farn, Devolce    
 Water, which lies in a lonely hollow  
 surrounded by the fells.  There is a  
 small boathouse and good fishing in   
 the lake.  There are many mounds and  
 ancient remains from an early British 
 settlement at Barnscar.
