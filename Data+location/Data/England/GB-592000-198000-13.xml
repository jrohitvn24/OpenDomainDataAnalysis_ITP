		<content>{The Police Station}and{Court House}   
 were built in 1901 because it was     
 thought that Southminster would grow  
 into a large town because of the      
{market}held there and therefore       
 require these facilities.This has not 
 happened and the market closed in     
 1969.It is a{magistrates'}court and is
 attached to the police station which  
 has cells but they are not heated so  
 prisoners who have to be kept         
 overnight have to be transferred to   
 Chelmsford.Southminster is the{main   
{police station}for the{Dengie         
{Hundred.}There are four policemen who 
 work shifts.There is a{Marine Section 
 which patrols the{Rivers Crouch and   
{Blackwater}and all rivers as far north
 as {Harwich}.The section has two      
 launches,one Fast Dory and employs one
 sergeant and eight constables.
