		<content> 3 of the farms in our survey had large
 dairy herds totalling 382 cattle and 4
 of the farms had pig units which      
 totalled 3,025 pigs.                  
 All of the farms had existed for over 
 150 years and many of the farmers     
 still lived in the original farmhouse.
 Nowadays these buildings are          
 surrounded by large industrial units  
 to house machinery. The traditional   
 field pattern has virtually           
 disappeared and many hedgerows have   
 been uprooted to take the new         
 machinery. The average size of a field
 in this area is now 18 acres.         
 Despite the many changes in farming   
 methods, the seasons are still        
 important to the farmers as they all  
 reported that their busiest time was  
 between August and September and the  
 quietest time was between January and 
 March.                                </content>
