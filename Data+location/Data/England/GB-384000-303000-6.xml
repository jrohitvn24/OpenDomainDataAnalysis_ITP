		<content>There has been a church on the hill for
many centuries. The oldest part of St. 
Nicholas' is the tower which dates back
to the 11th.century. The tower has 52  
steps and 8 bells. There are thirteen  
stained glass windows one of which has 
a picture of the church itself. The    
porch is on the south side. The church 
is on the highest ground locally, being
450 feet above sea level and local     
tradition has it that there is no      
higher land between the church and     
Russia ! The original vicarage was     
built in l848 (the same year that the  
Birmingham - Shrewsbury Railway reached
Codsall) on the site of a former public
house called the Bush. During the      
previous year Codsall had become a     
separate Parish.
