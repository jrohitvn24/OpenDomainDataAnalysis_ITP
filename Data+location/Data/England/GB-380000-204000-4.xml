		<title>04STROUDWATER CANAL CONTINUED.</title>
		<content>      Some sections of the canal have  
 been cleared.Both the Trust and       
 Company believe that it will be       
 re-opened one day.There are many      
 problems in restoring the canal e.g.  
 finance,obtaining permission from the 
 owners of adjacent land and rebuilding
 the locks.All the locks along the     
 canal have to be rebuilt.In this area 
 there are 3 sets of locks - Ryeford   
 Double , Dudbridge and Foundry Locks. 
      When the canal is re-opened it   
 will be used for pleasure boats,      
 angling and nature conservation.The   
 restoration will cost several million 
 pounds.Mr.Nott thought it would       
 possibly take 15 years.The Canal Trust
 does most of the work with the help of
 the Manpower Services Commission aided
 by financial help from the Company.
