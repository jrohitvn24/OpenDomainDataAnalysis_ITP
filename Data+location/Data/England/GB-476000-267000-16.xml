		<content>    Mr.and Mrs.Kay live at{Fox Lodge,}a
 converted estate workers cottage near 
 Moulton Grange, about 1Km.to the north
 east of{Pitsford}village. Mr.Kay works
 for Barclaycard and his wife is a     
 teacher. Both travel daily into       
 Northampton by car. There are about   
 ten houses in the tiny community and  
 most people commute into Northampton. 
   One neighbour, Mr.Roger Thom, runs a
 vetinary suppliers from his home.     
  Mrs.Kay enjoys the{peaceful isolation
 of the community and says it is       
 perfect for a quiet life due to the   
 absence of through traffic or other   
 modern disturbances.The only event of 
 note in recent months has been the    
 unexplained loss of a beehive!        
   The local shop is expensive so      
 Mrs.Kay travels to Kingsthorpe to shop
 at the Waitrose supermarket each week.
