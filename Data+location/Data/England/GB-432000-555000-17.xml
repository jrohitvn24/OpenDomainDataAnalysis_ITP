		<content> For breakfast I have cereal most      
 mornings, cornflakes, weetabix or bran
 and sometimes toast and jam.At        
 weekends when there is no school and  
 no work we sometimes have bacon and   
 egg. My school lunch consists of      
 sandwiches, crisps and an apple and   
 sometimes I get sweets or chocolate.  
 At school we can buy sweets, crisps   
 and biscuits at the tuck shop. At home
 I like to eat things like baked beans,
 chips and curry. Sometimes we go to   
 the Chinese take-away. A traditional  
 Sunday dinner is meat with vegetables 
 and Yorkshire puddings with gravy made
 from the meat juices. Then we         
 have ice-cream or fruit tart and      
 cream or sponge pudding and custard or
 yoghurt.For drinks I like tea, coffee,
 orange juice or Coca-Cola and         
 sometimes my Dad gives me a shandy.
