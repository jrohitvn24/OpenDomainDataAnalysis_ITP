		<title>17Housing-Downsview area</title>
		<content>  This is a non estate area with roads 
of mainly semi-detached houses built   
 ither in the 30's or in the 50's.We   
 did see 1 pre-victorian house and 2   
victorian houses.                      
  We talked to a lady who told us that 
the houses in Marse Way were all about 
40years old.Next we went up Rogers     
Court,there were 10 flats and 12       
terraced houses built during 60's to   
80's.There were 6 bungalows and 6      
houses in South view,the road went up  
and down hills.The gardens were well   
looked after with lovely gardens.      
  We saw a house that we thought was   
very old but the owner told us that it 
was much younger.
