		<title>17WORCESTER WATERWORKS</title>
		<content> There is a Waterworks between Park    
 Avenue and Waterworks Road. Part of   
 the Waterworks is old, perhaps        
{Victorian,}but there are also a lot of
 modern parts. There are eight settling
 pools. One for each section. There are
{Victorian}cast iron railings          
 surrounding all of it. The big old    
 building houses machinery. The workmen
 wear special{protective clothing.}The 
 Waterworks cleans the river water.    
 Four pools hold clean water and four  
 pools hold dirty  water. The dirty    
 water runs through the Waterworks     
 machines to clean it. Then it is      
 piped into our taps.
