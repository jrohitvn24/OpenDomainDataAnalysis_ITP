 folks homes. It is a beautiful place, 
 with cottages and a home which opened 
 in 1981. It was founded and paid for  
 by Michael Yoakley, who died in       
 1708.The cottages were started in 1709
 and additions have been made since    
 then. The gardens are very beautiful  
 with a massive fir tree and flower    
 beds. The Matron lives in the         
 clockhouse which has a Quaker chapel  
 attached. There are 40 cottages, 20   
 beds and in the home four sick-beds.  
    People from 60 upwards can live    
 there.
