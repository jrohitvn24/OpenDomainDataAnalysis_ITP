		<content> The Methodist Church seats 140        
 people(100 downstairs and 40 up in the
 balcony)It was built in 1851 and the  
 minister thinks it was built by       
 locals.                               
  The church is a simple rectangle.It  
 is 34ft wide,40ft long and is painted 
 white.                                
  The mother church is thought to be   
 the Westminster Central Hall.On the   
 wall by the altar are the             
 Commandments,The Lords Prayer and the 
 Creed.They are painted on a piece of  
 wood fixed on the wall.               
  John Wesley actually visited the     
 island and is thought to have stayed  
 at the Diver's Inn down at Braye      
 Harbour.                              
  There is also a strong Salvation
