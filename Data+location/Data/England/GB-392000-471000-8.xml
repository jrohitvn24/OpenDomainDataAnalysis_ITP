		<content>   Every year Littondale holds a Fete  
 on the first Saturday in August.  A   
 local band leads the children's fancy 
 dress through the village to the      
 field.  In the Village Hall there is a
 flower arranging competition, and     
 miniature garden and vegetable animal 
 competitions for children.            
   On the field are stalls selling a   
 variety of things and refreshments.   
 There are children's races,           
 demonstrations and competitions.  The 
 high-light of the day is the fell     
 race.  The route taken for this race  
 is quite strenuous, climbing to the   
 top of the fell, before returning to  
 the field in the valley bottom.       
   A clay pigeon shooting competition  
 also takes place in a field away from 
 the main Fete.                        
   The funds raised at the Fete help   
 with the upkeep of the Village Hall.  </content>
