		<content>{TIGGIE ON HIGH}is played by ages 4-9. 
 The idea of the game is for the person
 who is ON to try and TIG (touch)      
 someone who is not on HIGH (off the   
 floor) When he or she tigs then that  
 other person is on. It continues like 
 that.                                 
{THREE IN THE POT}is played by ages    
 8-11. The object being that the person
 who is ON tries to TIG a person who,  
 when tigged goes "into the pot".      
 Another person can tig you free but if
 he is caught in the act and tigged    
 then he must join you in the pot. When
 three are in the pot then the first   
 person in becomes the Tigger.         
{SWING BALL}is played by ages 6 &amp; over.
 The apparatus, which can be bought in 
 sports shops, it consists of a 5ft    
 stand to the top of which is attached 
 a length of string and a tennis ball. 
 A bat is used to strike the ball.     </content>
