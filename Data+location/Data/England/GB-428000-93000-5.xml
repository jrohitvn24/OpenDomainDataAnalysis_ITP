		<content> In the early 1960's the road which    
 passes the school used to be a farm   
 track.                                
 The name Pennington comes from the    
 name Penny Farm,a local farm for which
 a penny rent was paid.No trace remains
 of this farm today.                   
 The women of Pennington,up to the last
 war,used to take in washing from the  
 people of Lymington.This was done to  
 augment their husbands' wages.The     
 women would dry the washing on gorse  
 bushes on the Common.They used Donkey 
 Carts to carry the washing to and from
 Lymington.Pennington got the name of  
 Donkey Town after this.Some villagers 
 still call it by that name today.     
 Newlands Manor,a large country        
 house,used to be owned by the         
 Cornwallis-West family.Among the list 
 of people who stayed there are the    
 Kaiser and Lilly Langtry.             </content>
