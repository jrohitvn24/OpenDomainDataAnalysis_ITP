Draycott Manor County Primary School   
serves a vital role in the community as
there are no other comparable buildings
in the area which are available for use
by residents. The building is often    
used by the Parents, Teachers and      
Friends Association of the school both 
for money raising activities and social
functions such as badminton.           
                                       
Many other local groups such as the    
Women's Institue and the North         
Staffordshire Guild of Spinners,       
Dyers and Weavers use the school for   
their meetings.
