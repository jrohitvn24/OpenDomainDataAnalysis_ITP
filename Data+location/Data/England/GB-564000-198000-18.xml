		<content> Of the churches in Ingatestone the    
 oldest and most impressive is the     
 parish church of St. Edmund and St.   
 Mary (Church of England). Set slightly
 back from the High Street, parts date 
 from as early as the late 11th.       
 century. The tower was built of local 
 bricks in the late 15th. century      
 though to most people it appears more 
 modern. Further parts of the church   
 were added in the 16th. and early     
 17th. centuries and some restoration  
 was carried out in the 19th. century. 
                                       
 Buttsbury and Margaretting churches   
 are two small old churches in isolated
 locations. Access to Margaretting     
 church is across an unmanned level    
 crossing, there are a few houses      
 nearby but the village it serves      
 (Margaretting) is 1km. to the north   
 and outside the area studied.         </content>
