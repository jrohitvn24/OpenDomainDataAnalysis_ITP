		<title>09WORK IN TYDD ST.GILES</title>
		<content> Most of the people in or round Tydd   
 St.Giles are farmers or farmworkers   
 because there is a lot of farmland.   
    Some people do different jobs like 
 electricians and lorry drivers but    
 most of the people are farmers.       
    Most of the land is ploughed or    
 drilled by machinery.That's why we    
 need mechanics to mend the ones that  
 have broken down.                     
    Not all of the people in Tydd St.  
  Giles work on the land because some  
 work at the Diesel factory in         
 Peterbourgh and at the Metal Box      
 factory in Wisbech. Some of the people
 work in offices in Wisbech.           
    Some of the people in Tydd St.     
 Giles are out of work because there   
 aren't enough jobs.The only industry  
 in the village is a small lorry-body  
 works,and young people find that work 
 is hard to get.                       </content>
