		<title>08WORKING AT LOWER HIRST FARM</title>
		<content>    We buy and fatten beasts before we 
 sell them at about 17-18 months at    
 Bakewell, Doncaster &amp; Penistone       
 markets.                              
    This year Dad has about 30 beasts  
 inside &amp; he feeds them on a mixture of
 corn, molasses &amp; minerals. He grinds &amp;
 mixes it himself &amp; uses the tractor to
 work the grinder. The cattle are      
 allowed to roam free in the barn &amp;    
 need between 6 &amp; 9 weeks to fatten.   
 Farmers have to be careful corn fed   
 cattle don't become bloated. Dad has  
 about 30 heifers outside to fatten.   
 Dad tries to count them every day.    
 They move around the fields but we can
 walk to them.                         
    Between June &amp; October grass fed   
 beasts sell better than corn fed ones.
 Dad says that corn fed beasts have a  
 whiter fat than grass fed ones. I want
 to be a calf dealer when I grow up.   </content>
