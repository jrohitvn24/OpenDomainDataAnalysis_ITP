		<content>In 1768 an Act of Parliament enabled   
the construction of a canal running    
through Atherstone linking The Grand   
Trunk (Trent and Mersey Canal)to       
Coventry. The Coventry Canal Company   
dismissed James Brindley,the appointed 
engineer and surveyor in 1769 after a  
disagreement. At the end of 1771 the   
canal was open from Coventry to        
Atherstone but it was not until 1790   
that the extension to the junction at  
Fazeley was opened.The canal formed an 
important link between London and the  
North.Many goods became cheaper.Coal,  
lime and limestone could be carried to 
the town.Corn merchants also benefited 
from cheaper transport.The canal trade 
as most profitable in tne 1820's and   
steadily declined from 1830 to 1947,the
year of nationalisation.
