		<title>09KNOTTINGLEY SCHOOL LIFE</title>
		<content> Our school is Knottingley Vale        
 School,for children 5 to 12 years.    
 For English work we use an ink pen.   
 Inside its case is a wad of ink-soaked
 fibre.Ink flows onto the paper via a  
 fibre tip.In number we do The School  
 Mathematics Project.We work from cards
 which cover all aspects of number work
 including practical work.Our teacher  
 writes on a blackboard with chalk.Each
 week we have 20 spellings to learn for
 a test.Sometimes we paint,using powder
 paint,draw,using charcoal,pencil or   
 crayons,sew,make collages,balsa and   
 clay models.Some children learn to    
 play the 'cello,violin,flute,clarinet 
 and recorder.Games played are netball,
 rounders,football and cricket.        
 Assemblies are held Tuesday,Wednesday 
 and Thursday.Classes lead the assembly
 in turn but the headmaster takes the  
 assembly on Wednesday.                </content>
