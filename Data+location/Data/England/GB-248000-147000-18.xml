		<content> Ilfracombe is a small town but there  
 are quite a few jobs that people can  
 do. Such as farming, shop assistants  
 and bar persons. These people get     
 about Â£120.00 a week working everyday 
 but some might not have to work on    
 Sundays. They work about 8 hours a day
 especially shop assistants, but all   
 that they have to do is sit and press 
 buttons. I feel sorry for people that 
 are unemployed because there is       
 nothing to do except do the house work
 all the time. When you  have a regular
 job and earn some money you can have  
 a good time, but people who are       
 unemployed don't get a lot of money.  
 I think there are more people         
 unemployed in the winter when many    
 holiday jobs are lost. Then the       
 unemployment level is 28% of the      
 labour force.
