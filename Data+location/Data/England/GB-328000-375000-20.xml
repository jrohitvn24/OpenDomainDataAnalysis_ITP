		<title>20LADIES DAY, NESTON</title>
		<content> In the early days of this century the 
 day would sometimes end in near riot, 
 with policemen being called from      
 neighbouring villages to help maintain
 order.These days Ladies Day is very   
 peaceful.The children in the parade   
 wear white dresses and carry staffs   
 decorated with flowers to match their 
 dresses.The procession walks through  
 the village to the Parish Church where
 a service is held.The procession      
 continues to Neston Cross to listen to
 the 'National Anthem' and 'Abide With 
 Me'.The children retire to the Civic  
 Hall for a celebration tea.The whole  
 day is a very important part of Neston
 and people hope the day will still be 
 celebrated a hundred years from now.
