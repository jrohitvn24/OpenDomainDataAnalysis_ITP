		<title>12Eyebrook Landscape</title>
		<content> The landscape of this area is mainly  
 water,the reservoir covering 164.5 ha 
 of ground. There is a plantation of   
 coniferous woodland,mainly spruce     
 trees on the south and eastern flanks.
 These trees provide dunnage for the   
 Corby Tubeworks. The dam wall is      
 grassed and a drystone wall of York-  
 shire stone can be found to the south 
 of the dam.Apart from one adjoining   
 field which is grass where clay       
 quarrying took place to construct the 
 dam,the surrounding land is given over
 to mixed farming.There are fields of  
 cereals and pasture,mostly bounded by 
 hawthorn hedges.Around the perimeter  
 is a road,closed to the general public
 on the east,being owned by the water  
 company.There is a wooden clubhouse   
 for those coming to fish,and a fish   
 farm,for restocking the reservoir     
 situated in the Southeastern corner.  </content>
