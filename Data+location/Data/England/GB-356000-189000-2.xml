		<content> Brian Gee is the farmer who lives on  
 site at Manor Farm. He is in charge of
 milking the eighty-five Fresian cows. 
 This milk is then supplied to         
 Cliffords Dairy in Thornbury. The farm
 has no crops growing apart from grass 
 and occupies ninety-two acres. Only   
 two people are employed to work the   
 farm. The present farmer has been on  
 the farm for six years, but it is not 
 family run. It was built in the       
 seventeenth century but since then new
 buildings have been erected so the old
 ones are no longer used. Although cows
 are kept pigs are housed on a         
 different farm a few miles away. To   
 keep animals away from going too close
 to the fence it is electrified. Brian 
 said the thing he likes about farming 
 is being in the open.
