		<title>08   Farming</title>
		<content> There are 2 major land owners Williams
 of Werrington and Coode of Lanhydrock,
 some farms are owner occupied. Modern 
 machinery results in less man hours   
 and leads to decline of rural life.   
 Weather,once the factor in control, is
 usurped by disease laws and {EEC}trade
 restrictions on farming methods. A    
 mixed farming area beef, lamb,pork and
 milk,few cash crops.{Friesian herds   
 predominate,beef reared for profit    
 depends on veterinary skills and drug 
 companies to reach standards for      
 government subsidy.The milk quota idea
 is reluctantly accepted.If a farmer   
 wants to increase or decrease his out 
 put he must sell his existing farm and
 buy one with the quota needed.Returns 
 on milk are good many depend on the   
 monthly cheque from{MMB.}Farms are not
 self-sufficient in feed stuffs,animals
 are housed for 6 months of the year.  </content>
