		<title>05ST MICHAEL'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church at Ingram is small and is  
 opposite the information centre and is
 called ST MICHAEL'S.In the beginning  
 the church was not as we see it now   
 it was a thatched towerless building .
         In 1060 Ingram church was     
 restored.                             
         The oldest stonework can be   
 seen in the lower part of the tower.At
 the back of the building you can see  
 remains of steps against the wall they
 were used to go up to a room above    
 where they would be safe in times of  
 war.In the vestry and now hidden      
 behind the organ, there is a piscina  
 built into the north wall.            
         In the tower is a bell dated  
 1746 and carrying the initials of the 
 then churchwardens.There is a service 
 every Sunday except when weather makes
 it impossible.                        
                                       </content>
