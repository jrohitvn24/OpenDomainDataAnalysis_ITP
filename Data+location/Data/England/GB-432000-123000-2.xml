		<content>      The employees of{Michelmersh     
{Brickworks}have no particular ranks   
 but they all do their own jobs such as
 working the machines, making bricks by
 hand, collecting the bricks ready to  
 put into the drier and loading and    
 unloading the kilns.  In addition     
 there is an overall manager.  The{    
{Brickworks}have been running since    
 l840 and the clay at the back is      
 expected to last another 50 years.    
      The workers start at 7:30am and  
 finish at 5:00pm.  The {Brickworks}   
 cover at least 30_40 acres.  There are
 two main machines; one takes the clay 
 and mixes it with sand and coaldust,  
 the other machine actually makes the  
 bricks.  Most of the bricks, however, 
 are made by hand.  The{Brickworks}    
 employ between 80 and 90 people.
