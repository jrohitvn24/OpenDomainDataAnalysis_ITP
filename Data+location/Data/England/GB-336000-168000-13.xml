		<title>13THE COASTGUARD STATION</title>
		<content> On the Bristol Channel in the {West   
{End of Clevedon}there is a small      
 coastguard station which is manned by 
 15 auxiliary coastguards.             
 The most frequent type of incident is 
 for overdue or missing craft although 
 they get about four false alarms per  
 year.Most of the alarms are at the    
 weekend.The coastguard could be on    
 duty anything from 20 minutes to 24   
 hours.                                
 Clevedon does not have a lifeboat. The
 nearest one is at Weston-Super-Mare or
 Portishead and it can take 15 minutes 
 from Portishead or 30 from Weston.    
 The coastguards all have different day
 jobs including a student,a baker,a    
 doctor of physics,a computer engineer,
 a vicar,a plumber,a washing machine   
 engineer,a pharmacist,a caterer and   
 two retired people.
