		<content> A different type of oak is also found,
 its leaves have a sharper curve. This 
 is called the Turkey oak. Different   
 vegetation includes cotton grass,sun- 
 dews,nettles and a general ground cov-
 ering of moss.The same animals are    
 found with additions of small frogs &amp; 
 toads.The soil is mainly peat and less
 prone to fire. Butterflies &amp; moths are
 found in both areas.Birds found       
 include thrushes,starlings,sparrows,  
 stonechats,woodpeckers and nightjars. 
  The heathland has been extensively   
 planted with conifers since the end of
 18th.century.100 years later a royal  
 physician declared the area an except-
 ionally healthy one.Now conifers,mil- 
 itary activity and housing compete for
 the infertile soils.It is a contrast  
 to the 18th.century when highwaymen   
 rode a heath later described by       
 Cobbett as"bleak,barren &amp; villanous". </content>
