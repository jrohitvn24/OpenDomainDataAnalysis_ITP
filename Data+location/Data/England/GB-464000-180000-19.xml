		<title>19CHANGING TIMES IN WOODCOTE</title>
		<content>The Village Hall was donated to        
Woodcote by Mr Algernon Borthwick of   
Woodcote  House (now the Oratory       
School) as a recreation centre for the 
men who returned after the first       
world war and for village facilities.  
Billiards,card games and darts were    
played. The Village Hall was also      
used by the Women's Institute and for  
social evenings,whist drives and       
dances. The highlight of the week was  
the filmshow on Tuesday night.         
When the hall was first built the rec. 
was covered in prickly gorse. It was   
common land given to the village under 
the enclosure act. It was cleared      
so that cricket and football could be  
played there.                          
The school used in the 1920s still     
stands on the Langtree site. There     
were forty children aged 5 to 14 years.
