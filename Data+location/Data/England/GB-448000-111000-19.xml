		<title>19THE RIVER HAMBLE</title>
		<content> The River Hamble runs from just above 
 Botley and flows into Southampton     
 Water.It forms part of the Hamble     
 Country Park.It is used mainly for    
 leisure activities such as yachting,  
 canoeing and fishing.The river is     
 tidal and in fact is unusual because  
 it has double tides.The tidal limit is
 at Botley.                            
  The Hamble is one of a group of      
 rivers on tertiary sand and clay.The  
 flow is variable and these rivers are 
 more likely to flood.Along its banks  
 are examples of ancient woodland,     
 artificially drained and "unimproved" 
 meadows and some reed beds.Some of the
 "unimproved" grassland supports       
 several species of orchid including   
 the marsh and heath spotted orchids.
