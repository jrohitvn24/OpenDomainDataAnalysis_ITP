<title>35Dale Park</title>
<content>

To the east of Grizedale is Dale Park, a quiet and secluded valley. This has steeply wooded sides, with the lower slopes deciduous woodland and the higher fells commercial conifer plantations. The valley bottom is divided into numerous pastures where sheep and cattle graze. Although the conifer woodlands are still owned by the Graythwaite Estate, the remainder is now privately owned.&lt;br />&lt;br />Dale Park Beck, still the haunt of herons, winds its way to the south to join Force Beck at Rusland Pool. The road through the valley is for the most part a single-track road with passing places.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are three settlements in this valley, at High, Middle and Low Dale Park but there is only one property that remains a farm. All rely on private water supplies and drainage, as there are no water mains or sewage systems.   &lt;br />
