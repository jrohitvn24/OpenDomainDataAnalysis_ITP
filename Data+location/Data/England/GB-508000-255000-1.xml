		<content> Wilden village lies some 3.5 miles    
 N.E. of Bedford town.                 
 London is about an hour away by train 
 from Bedford, slightly longer by      
 Motorway.                             
 Cambridge and Northampton can be      
 reached within the hour.              
 This is a very flat cultivated area,  
 with huge fields everywhere.          
 Most of Wilden village is contained   
 within the Block, with outskirts of   
 Colmworth and Ravensden.              
 Lacking in many facilities, eg. shops,
 it is compensated by pleasant,        
 peaceful surroundings.                
 Each village is very different in     
 character, conscious of its own       
 identity, and proud of its own        
 achievements.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
