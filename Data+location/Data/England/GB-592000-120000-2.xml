		<content>  We asked a local councillor several  
 questions and found out that Rye town 
 council has only 16 councillors and   
 they have no real powers and only     
 suggest things to the district        
 councils. The Mayor is elected for    
 a year at a time by the council.      
 However the Rother District council   
 has powers and 45 councillors. Their  
 main office is at Bexhill.            
  East Sussex county council has the   
 most power and 70 councillors. The    
 main office is at Lewes.              
  Rye is the proud possessor of four   
 very fine maces and a beautiful       
 mayoral chain. Two of the  maces,     
 dating back to 1766 are so magnificent
 that they have been copied as the     
 official maces of the official maces  
 of the Canadian Parliament.
