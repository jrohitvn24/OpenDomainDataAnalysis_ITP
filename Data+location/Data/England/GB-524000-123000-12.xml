		<title>12LUCAS STORES, BOLNEY</title>
		<content>  It is a small{supermarket. }         
  We saw a piece of window_frame signed
{Henry Tulley 1872.}The Tulleys owned  
 it and sold clothes &amp; ironmongery.    
{ Frederick Lucas}bought the shop in   
{1924}and made it into a grocery store.
 His son{Cyril,}who now owns the shop, 
 became a{partner in 1950.}Frederick,at
 83,still comes in to weigh_up the     
 potatoes.                             
  They are open from{9a.m.to 5p.m.}and 
 close for an hour at lunch times,Sat. 
 afternoons &amp; all every day Sunday.    
  Cyril is usually in the shop from    
 7a.m. to take in early deliveries.    
  He has{5 staff,}who all work part    
 time.They are{4 ladies and 1 man.     
  Mr.Lucas does make deliveries but not
 outside of Bolney.                    
  The shop's cat of 17 yrs. does a good
 job of keeping the mice away.
