		<content> The block is situated in the south    
 -west of Kirklees and occupies a      
 strategic position between Yorkshire  
 and Lancashire. From the centre of the
 Colne Valley town of Slaithwaite the  
 area stretches west towards the       
 Pennine ranges rising steadily to 1200
 feet above sea-level.It includes      
 Scammonden, a once-remote valley, now 
 dominated by the reservoir and the    
 busy M62 motorway which crosses the   
 northern boundary.Towering above the  
 surrounding landscape are the twin    
 masts of the Moorside Edge radio      
 transmitter.                          
 This predominantly rural area consists
 mainly of grassland pastures which    
 support dairy and beef herds.Most of  
 the population live in the HillTop    
 district of Slaithwaite while the     
 remainder live in hillside property or
 small hamlets like{Wilberlee.}        </content>
