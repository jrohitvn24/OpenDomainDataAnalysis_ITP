		<content> In the Sandwell Valley ,as you cross  
 over the M5 Motorway ,you approach    
 swan pool. Here you can get involved  
 with sailing and windsurfing          
 activities. It is here that you find  
 the home of the Sandwell Valley       
 Sailing Club . Swan Pool is only used 
 by crafts which are not powered by a  
 motor . The area surrounding the pool 
 is used as part of the nature trail,  
 having picnic area and way marked     
 paths. Part of the land belongs to    
 Forge Farm,which concentrates on the  
 production of crops and sileage.The   
 other farm to be found in the Valley  
 is Old Forge Mill Farm,which is now   
 being converted into a residential    
 farm centre,whereby groups of chilren 
 can stay short periods to study the   
 local environment and to be involved  
 in the day to day running of a farm.
