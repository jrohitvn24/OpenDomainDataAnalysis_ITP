		<content> The people of Iwade, Kemsley and      
 Bobbing have to travel into           
 Sittingbourne or Milton to see a      
 doctor as there are no surguries in   
 any of these villages.This residents  
 find alarming as doctors do not seem  
 very keen to come out on home visits. 
 To take a child from Iwade to         
 Sittingbourne to see a doctor will    
 cost a mother Â£1.50 on the bus. They  
 will leave at 10am and not get back   
 until 1pm.                            
 In an emergency the nearest hospital  
 is nine miles away, and for people    
 visiting these hospitals the distance 
 can provevery daunting and            
 inconvenient.                         
 The Dentists can be consulted in      
 Sittingbourne but appointments are not
 easy to get in an emergency and for   
 adults treatment is now quite         
 expensive.                            </content>
