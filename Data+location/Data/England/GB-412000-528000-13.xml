 In 1984 there were four marriages in  
 the Church and 12 baptisms.           
     In the 1980's Parish Churches have
 found that the old endowments are no  
 longer sufficient to maintain the     
 expenses of the Church and Incumbent  
 and various fund-raising activities   
 have to take place. The number of full
 time clergy is in decline and many    
 Parishes in the future may have to    
 combine.  Witton Park and Escomb are  
 joined and others may have to in the  
 future.                               
      The Parish boundaries do not     
 coincide exactly with Local Authority 
 boundaries. Parochial boundaries date 
 back a long way and were designed to  
 ensure that each person was part of a 
 Community that cared for each person  
 from the cradle to the grave.  The    
 State has taken over these functions. </content>
