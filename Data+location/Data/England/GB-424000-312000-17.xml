		<title>17The Gypsy Life-style</title>
		<content>   The gypsy caravans are either 22 or 
 24 feet long. Most are drawn by car or
 van. There are still a few horse-drawn
 carriages but these are mainly found  
 in the south of England. The gypsies  
 also bring horses, ponies, goats, dogs
 and hens to the site. Horses are      
 tethered on land adjacent to the      
 caravans.                             
   Gypsies traditionally obtained a    
 living by fortune telling and         
 horse dealing but more recently they  
 prefer to deal in scrap metal. Most   
 gypsies are very happy with their     
 life-style but some, said the warden, 
 are hard to please. There is still a  
 strong tendency for gypsies to marry  
 other gypsies. The warden admitted    
 that he would prefer his son to marry 
 a gypsy girl rather than someone who  
 lives in a house.
