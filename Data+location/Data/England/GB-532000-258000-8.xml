 LOCALLY,CALDECOTE IS NICKNAMED"TIN    
 TOWN." THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE 
 EARLIEST BUILDINGS WERE MADE.         
 SOME WERE OLD RAILWAY CARRIAGES;SOME  
 WERE LITTLE MORE THAN SHACKS WITH A   
 TIMBER FRAME COVERED BY SHEETS OF     
 CORRUGATED IRON.NOW SOME NEWCOMERS    
 LIVE IN CARAVANS FOR A WHILE.         
 GRADUALLY,THESE TEMPORARY HOUSES HAVE 
 BEEN REPLACED BY PERMANENT BRICK      
 HOUSES,OF VERY INDIVIDUAL STYLE.HERE  
 IS A REPORT OF THE WAY ONE FAMILY HAS 
 COPED WITH IMPROVING ITS HOUSE.
