		<title>15Industry in Trafford Park 2</title>
		<content> There are a few large industrial      
 plants at the eastern end of Trafford 
 Park such as Esso Oil and Petrol      
 Regional Centre, Procter and Gamble   
 which make soap powders etc, General  
 Electric Company who are electrical   
 engineers and C.P.C. who refine       
 cornflour for use in custard powder   
 etc. You can smell their works for    
 miles when the wind blows from the    
 south! Many buildings are at least    
 twenty years old but here and there,  
 buildings have been demolished and    
 small, single storey factories have   
 been built for light, metal-working   
 industries eg. 797 971. A brand new   
 road system has been built called Park
 Way, which is much wider than the old 
 roads used to be and a small trading  
 estate of warehouses has been         
 established. The new Daily Telegraph  
 printing works is almost finished.    </content>
