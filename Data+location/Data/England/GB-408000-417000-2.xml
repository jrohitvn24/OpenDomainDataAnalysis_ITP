		<title>02JUSTYN'S DAY. AGED 6</title>
		<content>  In the morning I wake up and I play  
 for about half an hour. For my        
 breakfast I have cereal, sometimes    
 toast and a cup of tea to drink. Then 
 I get dressed and go to school. We    
 play in the playground until the      
 bell rings, then we have lessons. At  
 12 o'clock we have our dinner and     
 after that we go out to play. When we 
 come inside we go to the toilets and  
 wash our hands. Then we line up at the
 door, and after that we go in to the  
 classroom and read our books while we 
 wait for Mrs Butterworth to arrive.   
 Next we start work again. Later we go 
 out to play again and then we have a  
 story read. At 3.30p.m. we go home and
 I watch television while my mummy     
 makes the tea. After that I go        
 upstairs and have a wash. I put on my 
 pyjamas and say my prayers and then I 
 fall asleep. Zzzz.                    </content>
