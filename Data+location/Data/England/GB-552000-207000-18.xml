		<title>18LIVING IN HIGH LAVER</title>
		<content> I live in High Laver near Moreton.    
 I enjoy living in the country because 
 it is in the country where it is nice 
 and peaceful.                         
 I dont think I would enjoy living in  
 the town because it would be too noisy
 in the morning and at night because of
 all the cars.                         
 I like the country because there are  
 so many things to look at like flowers
 and birds and all sorts of things.    
 Also the air is fresh and more healthy
 than city or town air which has       
 horrible fumes in it.                 
 The thing I like the most about the   
 country is that my Dad works on a farm
 so I can go and help him, especially  
 at harvest time.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
