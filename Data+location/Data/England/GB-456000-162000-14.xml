		<title>14EDUCATION IN THE TADLEY AREA</title>
		<content> The division of the area into the two 
 counties of Berkshire and Hampshire is
 most marked in education. Children in 
 Berkshire (the rural area in the main)
 attend primary schools in Aldermaston 
 or Brimpton then the Kennet Compre-   
 hensive School at Thatcham or the     
 Willink School at Burghfield, all     
 outside the survey area. Hampshire    
 children go to Burnham Copse and      
 Bishopswood Primary Schools in Tadley 
 then at 11 to the Hurst School which  
 has 1150 pupils and 63 teachers plus  
 ancillary staff, its catchment area   
 extends beyond our area. CSE and O    
 Level examinations in a wide range of 
 subjects are offered but there is no  
 6th Form. Facilities for further      
 education are available in Newbury and
 Basingstoke. The only private school  
 in the survey area is Inhurst House   
 School for 4 to 13 year olds.         </content>
