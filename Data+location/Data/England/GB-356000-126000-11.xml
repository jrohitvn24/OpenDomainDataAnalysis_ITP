		<content>       The Post Office in Babcary is   
 graded Grade II, and business is so   
 low that it is due to close down      
 sometime during July 1985.            
       The only Bus Service available  
 is in Babcary, and there are only two 
 regular buses, both being school ones.
 One goes to Castle Cary and the other 
 to Huish Episcopi.                    
       There is only one school that is
 in our area, and that is Hazlegrove   
 House, a prep school. Although        
 Hazlegrove has about two hundred and  
 fifty boys at the moment, there are   
 plans to greatly expand soon.         
       There is only one church in our 
 area and that is in Babcary. The      
 church is called The Church of the    
 Holy Cross, and is about five hundred 
 years old although there has been a   
 church on this site for over a        
 thousand years.                       </content>
