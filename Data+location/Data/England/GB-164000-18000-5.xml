		<content> When someone is drowning at sea a team
 of six people conduct the rescue in   
 the following way: The rescuer puts on
 a harness which is attached to a      
 strong line on a reel, which the      
 linesman operates. The four other     
 members pay out line over their heads 
 as the rescuer swims out to the person
 in difficulties. When he reaches the  
 patient, he will signal to the team.  
 They will pull them both in until they
 reach the shore. After placing the    
 patient on the beach, the linesman    
 will try to resuscitate him. When he  
 starts breathing, he is put in the    
 recovery position. The whole team     
 stays with him until he recovers or   
 until qualified medical help arrives. 
 The equipment is put away carefully so
 that it may be used quicly the next   
 time there is an emergency.
