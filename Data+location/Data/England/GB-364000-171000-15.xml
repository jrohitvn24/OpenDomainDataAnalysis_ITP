		<title>15BMX riding in Kingswood.</title>
		<content> My hobbies are computers, remote      
 control cars, football and attending  
 Kingswood Karate Club and Summit Youth
 Club.My main hobby is BMX racing which
 has become very popular in the 1980's 
 for children.It is a fast, skilled,   
 and expensive{sport.}To race, you must
 wear protective gear and have a BMX   
 (costing Â£200).A BMX is a lightweight{
{bike}made from T45 aircraft material, 
 covered in chrome.A crank, chain and  
 wheels make it move.You{race}on a long
 dirt track, going in different        
 directions.From a hill start you ride 
 down, passing over jumps, built up    
 mounds of earth called bumps, and     
 tight bends called berms.In 1983 I won
 the British Championship for the Under
 9's at Derby, and in 1985 qualified   
 for the European Championship in Spain
 and World Championship in Canada.
