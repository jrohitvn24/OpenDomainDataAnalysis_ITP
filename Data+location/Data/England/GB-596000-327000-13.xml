 Opposite Gt.Ryburgh School is         
 St.John's Hall, a former blacksmith's 
 shop and seed store, bought for the   
 use of the St.John's Ambulance Brigade
 by Sir Thomas Cook of Sennowe Park, a 
 lifelong supporter of the movement.   
 Today it is cheaper to hire the school
 than heat the hall for meetings, which
 are attended weekly by 18 children    
 aged 8 to 16 for instruction in First 
 Aid, Home Nursing, Fire Prevention,   
 Road and Home Safety, Cooking and     
 Nutrition, Animal Care and Camp Craft.
 Their volunteer instructor, Harry     
 Plattin from Great Ryburgh takes them 
 to a Summer Camp at Northrepps each   
 year.  The members each pay a         
 subscription of ten pence per week.
