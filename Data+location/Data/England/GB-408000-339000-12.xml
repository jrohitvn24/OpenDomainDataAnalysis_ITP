		<title>12Farming</title>
		<content>    This area is predominately a dairy 
farming area,although because the      
government have given each farmer a    
milk qusta which they must not pass.   
Many small farmers have changed to beef
cattle.There are many small farms,and 1
or 2 large ones.The smaller farms      
employ the more traditional methods of 
farming while the larger ones try new  
methods.Most of the animals are put out
to eat grass in the summer except for D
Denstone Hall where they are kept      
inside all the time and fed silage.    
There is only 1 farm in the area which 
keeps pigs,Greenacres.Two farms breed  
horses Quixhill and Calwich Cottage    
where the farmer has sold most of his  
land to Alton Towers but breeds        
Shetland ponies in his retirement.As   
farmers get to retiring age they       
sometimes change to beef because it is 
much easier work.                      </content>
