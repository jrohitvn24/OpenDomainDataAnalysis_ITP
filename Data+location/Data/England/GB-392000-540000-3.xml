      The Village Hall provides a large
 hall, committee room, kitchen and     
 toilets for the use of its patrons.   
      It was, and still is, run by a   
 management committee drawn from       
 different walks of life in the        
 village and today includes a farmer's 
 wife, the post mistress and the school
 master, to mention just a few.        
      There are other meeting places in
 the village such as two shops, a pub  
 and a working man's club but the      
 village hall is the only place that   
 can be hired for private use and the  
 only place big enough to hold dances  
 and the like.
