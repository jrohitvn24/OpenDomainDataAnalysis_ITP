		<title>13Weston Turville Shop</title>
		<content>     My Mum and Dad's employment is the
local shop.They get up every morning at
5.30a.m,but on Sundays they get up at  
6.30a.m. When they have got up they    
mark up the papers for the paperboys.  
     The sort of people who come in the
shop,come in at different times,and    
they stick to a timetable.At 7.30a.m.  
all the workmen come in to buy         
newspapers and cigarettes.At 8.30a.m   
the children come in for sweets for    
their packed lunches.At 9.00a.m all the
mums come in from seeing their         
children off to school.At 9.30 a.m and 
onwards mums,old people,and people out 
of work come in.At 4.00p.m. school     
children  and mums appear again.       
     The house we live in is above the 
shop.It's like any other house,but you 
have to walk up two flights of stairs  
instead of one.
