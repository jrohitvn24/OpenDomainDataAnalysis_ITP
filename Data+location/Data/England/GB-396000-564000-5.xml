   Education in Corbridge starts with  
 pre-school children.There is a toddler
 group followed by Play School from age
 three;these are organised by a        
 committee of mothers and supervised by
 qualified staff.There is also a       
 private nursery school.These lead on  
 to Corbridge Church of England Aided  
 First School,which now has 151 five to
 nine year old pupils.Children come to 
 this school from surrounding villages 
 as well as Corbridge itself,but       
 children from Sandhoe go to Beaufront 
 or Hexham.At age nine Corbridge First 
 School children join others from      
 Riding Mill,Whittonstall and Slaley at
 Corbridge Middle School which has 207 
 pupils.At age thirteen children travel
 to Hexham,to the Queen Elizabeth High 
 School.
