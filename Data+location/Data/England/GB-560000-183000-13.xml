		<title>13PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content>    In our playground we play games    
 like{hop-scotch, had}and{numbers.}They
 sometimes take up a lot of the        
 playground but normally not many games
 take up much space.                   
    One of the most popular games is   
{had,}(it is sometimes called{it)}and  
 you need more than two people to play.
 One person is made{it;}he has to chase
 the others and tap someone on the back
 and say{had. }That person is now{it,  
 then you carry on until everybody is  
 tired and hot. There are lots of games
 similar to{it}but in some games like  
{off ground touch}you do something else
 as well. In that game{it}cannot catch 
 anybody if they are{off the ground.   
   Our games that we play now are quite
 simple but who knows what they will be
 like in{900 years'}time. Only time    
 will tell!
