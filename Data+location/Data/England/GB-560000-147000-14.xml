		<title>14Gravel Pit Development</title>
		<content>  One day,we went for a walk by the    
 River Medway.On our walk we saw some  
 men and they said they were going to  
 dig a gravel pit.They said they were  
 going to build a road from Hadlow     
 Stair to cross the Medway.The road is 
 now under construction.They will be   
 building two bridges;one over the     
 Medway and one over a dyke.Here they  
 will dig a gravel pit and extract     
 gravel.                               
  I think the area now is nice and     
 unspoilt.I do not like the idea of    
 digging a gravel pit because it will  
 spoil the area.I hope that when they  
 have finished extracting the gravel   
 they will fill the pit in and leave   
 the area nice and unspoilt once again.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
