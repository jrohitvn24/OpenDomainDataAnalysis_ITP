		<title>07THE IREBY CHALICE</title>
		<content> The Ireby Chalice is one of the most  
 precious of Ireby's treasures. After  
 nearly being lost to the parish       
 forever, through good fortune the     
 Parish regained possession of the     
 Chalice in 1980.                      
 The Chalice is a rare Elizabethan     
 silver cup and was made by Edward     
 Dalton of Wigton around 1571.         
 The Chalice belonged to Ireby Church  
 until 1848, when the Bishop and       
 Churchwardens presented it to Mrs.    
 Grainger of High Ireby in gratitude   
 for her gift of a new set of silver   
 for the Church to commemorate her     
 son's christening.                    
 The Chalice was in the possession of  
 various people but was finally        
 purchased from an antique dealer for  
 Â£4000, and re-dedicated at its        
 home-coming on Palm Sunday 1980.
