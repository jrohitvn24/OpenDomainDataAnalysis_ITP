		<title>03Cornwood's traffic problem</title>
		<content> Cornwood's main highway is a B road,  
 built over 100 yrs. ago. In parts it  
 is quite narrow with sharp bends and  
 hump-backed bridges.Villagers are     
 concerned about the heavy traffic     
 passing through from nearby china-clay
 works to the A38 dual carriageway. 12-
 14 wheeled trucks frequently drive    
 through the village, often having     
 difficulty in passing.The road is     
 badly worn, with many pits, and the   
 pavement is slowly sinking due to     
 lorries mounting it.Cottages beside   
 the road are suffering damage to their
 foundations.Children have to cross    
 this dangerous road to get to school. 
 The village shop keeper said he didn't
 mind the busy road, but other people  
 feel that another route should be     
 taken.Protest letters have been       
 written to the Minister of Transport.
