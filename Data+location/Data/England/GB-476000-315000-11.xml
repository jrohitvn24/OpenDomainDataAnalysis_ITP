 LOCAL HISTORY                         
 The village was first mentioned in the
 Domesday Book in 1086,it was then     
 called Burtone.It belonged to the     
 estate of Geoffrey de Wirce, of       
 Melton.In the Middle Ages a leper     
 hospital was situated alongside the   
 village and the village was known as  
 Burton(e) Sancti Lazari. A lazar is a 
 person affected by the disease of     
 Leprosy.                              
  Many cottages used to have thatched  
 roofs but today only one thatched roof
 remains. The oldest houses in the     
 village are made of grey stone from   
 Clipsham or the softer brown stone of 
 Pickwell.Some of the old houses have  
 been re-roofed or moderned completely.</content>
