		<content> Although the edge of our area is      
 within one mile of the M5 Motorway,we 
 do not have access to the motorway    
 junctions and travel 5 miles either   
 north or south to Junctions 26 or 27. 
 Almost all of the roads in our area   
 are single track and this means that  
 even small cars have to reverse for   
 each other.If buses meet farm trailers
 this can cause quite a traffic holdup.
 Drivers are usually very careful and  
 travel slowly,but sometimes we find   
 that people who do not know the roads 
 travel too fast and there have been a 
 number of accidents in the last year  
 or so.Sometimes tractors and cows pull
 mud out of fields on to the lanes and 
 this means that we have to be very    
 careful.
