		<title>07Blennerhasset Cricket Club.</title>
		<content> I joined Blennerhasset Cricket Club on
 the 13th June .Blennerhasset is about 
 three miles away from Fletchertown.   
 These are some of the players who play
 for Blennerhasset Cricket Club.Mark   
 Rawel,Mark Williams,(Captain) Martin  
 Turner,Martin Batty,(Vice Captain)and 
 Stuart Wilson.We bat on a 22 yard     
 pitch that's where we've got to       
 bowl and the whole cricket pitch is   
 about 800 yards in diameter.          
 We travel by car,to matches away      
 from the village,and we have to take  
 50p with us to pay for the petrol.We  
 play twenty overs and we have four    
 bowlers they are,Martin Batty,Richard 
 Hunter,Craig Donald,Mark Rawel.An over
 is six bowls of the ball. These are   
 some of the places we have been to    
 play, Cockermouth, Keswick and we     
 played Workington at home.It is       
 necessary to wear white when bowling. </content>
