		<content> Sources of energy are: electricity for
 lighting, cooking, heating and        
 domestic appliances including light   
 gardening tools such as               
 hedge-trimmers. Oil is used for       
 domestic water heating and central    
 heating. Solid fuel ie. coal,         
 smokeless coal derivatives, and wood, 
 are all used for cooking and heating. 
 Wood-burning stoves and cooker-boilers
 are becoming popular. Oil is used for 
 running much farm machinery. Natural  
 gas is not piped to the area although 
 supply pipes are nearby, a sore point 
 with many householders as it is the   
 cleanest and most economical fuel.    
 Solar heating for domestic hot water  
 is being considered as an alternative 
 or supplementary source of energy for 
 water and room heating but is not yet 
 in common use.
