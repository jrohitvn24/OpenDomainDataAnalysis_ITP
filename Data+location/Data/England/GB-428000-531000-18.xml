		<title>18Allotments in Ferryhill</title>
		<content> When Ferryhill expanded during the    
 early years of the century the        
 individual houses did not have gardens
 attached so open areas were made      
 available for allotments.These are    
 still in existence(many have passed   
 down through families) and are rented 
 annually from the Town Council.Their  
 existence has led to the development  
 of two typical North-Eastern pastimes.
{Pigeon Racing}Popular in most mining  
 communities this still thrives in the 
 Ferryhill area.The birds are raced    
 over various distances including cross
 Channel races from France and Belgium.
{Leek Growing}The leeks are grown for  
 competition rather than for eating    
 purposes.Every Autumn there are shows 
 in each of the many pubs and clubs to 
 see who has managed to grow the       
 largest leek.As an incentive there are
 attractive cash prizes.               </content>
