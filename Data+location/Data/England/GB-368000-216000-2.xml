		<content>{Blaisdon Hall}was built in 1876 by    
 Edwin Crawshay.The next owner of the  
 hall was Peter Stubbs who died in     
 1904.It is an Elizabethan style hall  
 and over looks some beautiful         
 countryside. All the houses were sold 
 off very cheaply when the estate was  
 sold in 1933, they are all now        
 privately owned.{Blaisdon Hall}is now 
 a school. The church was rebuilt in   
 1867 and was opened in 1869, costing  
 Â£2000. The tower on the church dates  
 back to the 13th century. The{Red Hart
 is the only public house in Blaisdon  
 and has been there since 1856. We     
 obtained this information from        
{Mr Cedric Etherington}who lives in    
 Blaisdon. His hobby is researching the
 local history of the parish.
