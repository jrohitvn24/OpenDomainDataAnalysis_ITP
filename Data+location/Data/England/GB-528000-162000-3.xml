Twenty years ago the area that is now  
the Roundshaw Estate was grassland.    
There were many quite rare wildflowers 
including an orchid that conservation- 
ists were particularly interested  in. 
In summer the air was filled with the  
sound of skylarks hovering over nests  
and kestrals swooping for fieldmice.   
There were many foxes in this area who 
used to wander the surrounding roads   
and gardens;foxes have not been seen   
for three or four years now. It was    
said that there was a badger set in the
woods bordering Foresters Drive.
