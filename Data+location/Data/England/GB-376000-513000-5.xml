		<title>05ROMANS AROUND BROUGH</title>
		<content> WHEN THE ROMANS CAME TO BROUGH THEY   
 BUILT A FORT CALLED VERTERAE.IT WAS   
 THE REST PLACE FOR THE ROMANS AFTER   
 THEY HAD THEIR LONG WALK FROM YORK TO 
 SCOTLAND WITH THE LAST STOP AT MAIDEN 
 CASTLE FORTLET ON STAINMORE.WHILE THE 
 ROMANS STAYED IN BROUGH THEY BUILT    
 MANY ROADS.THERE ARE TWO MAIN ROMAN   
 ROADS THAT WE STILL USE TODAY.THE A685
 STARTS AT BROUGH AND GOES THROUGH     
 BROUGH SOWERBY.THE A66 WHICH STRETCHES
 FROM WORKINGTON TO MIDDLESBROUGH WAS  
 NOT ALL BUILT BY THE ROMANS,THE PART  
 THAT WAS STARTED FROM BOWES TO        
 COUPLAND FORT. WHEN THE NORMANS CAME  
 THEY  BUILT A CASTLE IN ONE CORNER OF 
 THE ROMAN FORT.THE CASTLE WAS VERY    
 STRONG WITH WALLS 10 FEET THICK.IN    
 1314 ROBERT THE FIRST LORD CLIFFORD   
 REPAIRED THE CASTLE BECAUSE THE SCOTS 
 BURNED THE TIMBER.                    
 THE CASTLE IS NOW IN RUINS.           </content>
