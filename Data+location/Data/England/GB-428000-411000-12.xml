		<title>12A Visit to the Motorway.</title>
		<content> On Thursday, 23rd May 8 of us went to 
 see the M1 Motorway.First we stood on 
 the motorway bridge and started       
 counting cars.I saw 124 cars in ten   
 minutes, so in an hour I would have   
 seen about 744 cars.There were lots of
 lorries and vans besides.It is a busy 
 road, going northwards to Leeds and   
 southwards to London.There are        
 separate carriageways for traffic     
 travelling in opposite directions.Each
 carriageway is wide, with three lanes 
 of traffic.The bridge was being       
 repaired because the iron inside was  
 going rusty.There were signs on the   
 motorway to warn the traffic that the 
 bridge was being repaired.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
