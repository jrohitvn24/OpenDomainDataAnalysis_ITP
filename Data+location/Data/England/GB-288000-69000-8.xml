 buildings,such as Stokeinteignhead    
 school which is over 100 years old.The
 House of Prawns, a local restaurant,  
 used to be three separate cottages.   
 There are three pubs in the area, the 
 Church House Inn, the Wild Goose and  
 Combe Cellars. All are very old       
 buildings. Near the school is the Old 
 Forge and also the Old Chapel. Both   
 are now private homes.Close by is     
 Random Cottage where coffins used to  
 be made. Opposite the Church House Inn
 is the Old Bakery which is now a cafe.
