		<title>04 The Pedestrian System.</title>
		<content> The original development plans stated 
that it was necessary to create        
strongly defined pedestrian routes     
within the area itself and to all      
adjacent areas.Along the main N-S and  
E-W spines were to be located all the  
schools, shops, community buildings and
major open spaces and play areas.      
 A survey of the two spines revealed   
the following:- The north-south spine  
prvides convenient access to a         
children's playground, the local centre
on the Local Authority estate,the      
sport's stadium and Glascote           
Comprehensive school.Located along the 
east-west spine are Belgrave           
Comprehensive school, a sports centre  
and a park with pavilion.              
 There are three danger points where   
the N-S spine runs close to the main   
road and where both spines cross       
Marlborough Way via Pelican Crossings. </content>
