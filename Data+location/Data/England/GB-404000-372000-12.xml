		<title>12Buxton:Road Transport</title>
		<content>  Buxton is the meeting place of       
 several major roads and routes.The{A6}
 passes through the town,and carries   
 traffic from Bakewell,Matlock and     
 further south towards Stockport and   
 Manchester.This road carries a great  
 deal of traffic,including many heavy  
 lorries from neighbouring quarries.   
 Indeed,there has been such pressure on
 the road through Fairfield that there 
 has been much talk of a bypass.People 
 in Fairfield are worried because of   
 the lack of access to the estates for 
 the emergency services when the road  
 is congested with traffic.            
  Other important routes are those to  
 Congleton,Macclesfield,Leek and the   
 Potteries,and the scenic route over   
 Long Hill to Manchester.Many of the   
 roads leading out of Buxton are       
 attractive to tourists because of the 
 beautiful countryside they cross.     </content>
