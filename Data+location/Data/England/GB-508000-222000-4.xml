		<title>04PEOPLE'S PARK/POPES MEADOW</title>
		<content> People's Park is bigger than Pope's   
 Meadow. In People's Park they have    
 lots of green trees and it has swings,
 see-saws and a roundabout for the     
 children to play on. Pope's Meadow    
 does not have a playground, it is a   
 little park where children can play.  
 Pope's Meadow does not have a lot of  
 trees to shelter from the sun. Each of
 the parks has a changing room where   
 the boys get changed and they have    
 football posts. Our school, Richmond  
 Hill, is just on top of Pope's Meadow.
 In the winter our school goes sledging
 with some teachers. In the summer some
 of the boys go cross country running  
 around the parks.
