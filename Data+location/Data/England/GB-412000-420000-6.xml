		<title>06EDUCATIONAL CHANGE</title>
		<content>    1985 was an important year for     
 education in the Brighouse area. The  
 eleven-plus examination was abolished 
 and selective secondary education was 
 replaced by a comprehensive system.   
 Existing Grammar Schools were merged  
 with the Secondary Modern Schools to  
 form the new High Schools.            
    After a history dating back to     
 1621, Rastrick Grammar School was     
 amalgamated with the newer Reins Wood 
 School,which itself originated as a   
 British and Foreign Bible Society     
 school, opened at Rastrick Common in  
 1832. The new Rastrick High School    
 was to cater for 800 local children.  
 Brighouse Girls'Grammar School also   
 became a co-educational High School.  
    Reorganisation came after a decade 
 of local controversy. One old         
 established school opted out of the   
 state system and became independent.  </content>
