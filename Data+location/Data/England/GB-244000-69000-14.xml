  There is a small{Hydro-electric}power
 station at{Morwellham.}It was opened  
 in 1934 and uses the water from the   
 Tavistock Canal.20,000 tons of mud was
 removed from the disused canal and a  
 new 135ft tunnel had to be made to    
 bring the water to the station.       
   There are two 500 horse-power       
 turbines which produce 11,000 volts of
 electricity.8,000,000,000  gallons of 
 water a year pass through the station 
 into the river Tamar.                 
    Every year the canal is emptied for
 cleaning and the big pipes have to be 
 cleared of rubbish.                   
     l8 people work at the Station but 
 most of the time it runs on its own.
