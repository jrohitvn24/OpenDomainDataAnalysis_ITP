		<title>03Daisy Cottage</title>
		<content>{Daisy Cottage,}the oldest building in 
 the village is Georgain.It used to be 
 a pair of semi_detched cottages but   
 has been one cottage for a long time  
 now.                                  
  It was built out of the Abbey bricks.
 It has a tiled roof and three chimney 
 stacks.The windows have very small    
 panes of glass and some are still     
 bricked up from the days when there   
 was a tax on windows.                 
 It is in a poor condition and the     
 gable at the east end is leaning and  
 there is a six inch gap in the roof   
 which is starting to sag.There is a   
 great danger that it may collapse and 
 we shall no longer have a Daisy       
 Cottage.Although the cottage is       
 occupied, the cost of renovation      
 would be too great for the owners and 
 its future is uncertain.
