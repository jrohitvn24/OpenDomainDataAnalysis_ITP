		<title>14A day in the life of Mum</title>
		<content> Melanie's mum repeats the same routine
 everyday. A coffee to start the day   
 follows the trip to take Melanie's    
 sister to school.                     
 She hoovers, polishes, washes the     
 dishes and sweeps the floor           
 downstairs. It is very tiring so she  
 sits down to rest with a coffee and   
 chocolate biscuits. Upstairs is next, 
 making beds and tidying around. It is 
 then about 11 o'clock. Then comes     
 gardening; she inspects her plants and
 enjoys the sunshine.                  
 At about 2.45 pm her mum picks        
 Melanie's sister up from school and at
 3.30 pm she sits down and watches     
 television. By 4 o'clock, however,    
 when Melanie returns, the house is    
 untidy again.                         
 Her mum prepares dinner next, then    
 watches the television before bed.
