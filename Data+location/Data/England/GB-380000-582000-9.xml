		<content> The small stone{church of St.Cuthbert 
 stands overlooking the township of    
 Bellingham.Parts of the church date   
 back to the eleventh century.It has a 
 stone roof,unique in England which was
 put up to replace the wooden roof     
 which was so regularly burned down by 
 the Scots on their border raids.Canon 
 balls were found on the roof when it  
 was replaced in 1861.                 
 In the church yard can be seen the    
{long pack grave. } (see page 10)      
 A narrow path outside the church leads
 down to Cuddies Well(see page 10).The 
 water from this well is supposed to   
 cure illnesses and is still used for  
 baptisms.                             
 Outside the Town Hall stands an       
 antique gun captured from the Chinese 
 during the Boxer Rebellion and        
 presented to the town by Admiral Sir  
 Edward Charlton of Hesleyside.        </content>
