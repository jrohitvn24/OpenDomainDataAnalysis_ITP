		<content>   Until recently this was a           
 predominantly dairying area but with  
 the introduction of the Common Market 
 quotas several of the farms have      
 changed to beef.                      
   One local person told us that of the
 five farms closest to the village,all 
 of which had had dairy herds three had
 gone out of milking.                  
   There is some cereal farming mainly 
 for use a food for the cattle.        
 Similarily the is some hay grown and  
 silage made.There is very little grown
 as a commercial investment.
