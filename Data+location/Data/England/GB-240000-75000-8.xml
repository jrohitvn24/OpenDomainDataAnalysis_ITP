		<content> No military installations in the area 
 but some service personnel (Naval and 
 R.M.) and Dockyard workers commute to 
 Plymouth. Area forms part of a low    
 flying range for the Royal Air Force. 
 There are no clubs within the area,   
 but people belong to clubs that meet  
 nearby, W.I.,Women's Guild,Lions,Young
 Farmers,Youth Clubs,Round Table,Rotary
 Scouts,Guides. Local pubs run darts,  
 pool and snooker clubs.               
 Attitudes are conservative (not polit-
 ical sense).Farmers have consideration
 for wildlife and the environment, and 
 most of the land is well maintained.  
 Most people,though recognising the    
 need, resent the power of Planning    
 Authority.                            
 Leisure activities include painting,  
 woodwork,model engineering, and arts  
 and crafts in many forms.
