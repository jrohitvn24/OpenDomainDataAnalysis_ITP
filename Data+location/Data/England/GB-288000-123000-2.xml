		<content>     St.Nicholas Church,Brushford, the 
 only church in the survey area,is a   
 beautiful 13 century building.        
     A chapel designed by Sir Edward   
 Lutyens was added in 1924 in memory of
 Aubrey Herbert of Pixton Park (the man
 who was Greenmantle).                 
     Brushford is now a United Benefice
 with Dulverton,with one service each  
 Sunday and congregations of 25_30.    
     100 colourful hassocks,embroidered
 by ladies of the parish and friends,  
 were begun during Jubilee Year,1977.  
     Local legend inaccurately credits 
 an ancient oak tree in the church yard
 with being mentioned in the 1086      
 Domesday Book.It recently underwent   
 surgery to render it safe and prolong 
 its life.                             
     Methodists and Roman Catholics    
 have Chapels in Dulverton.
