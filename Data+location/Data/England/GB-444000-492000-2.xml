		<content> The present day farmer is well        
 educated.Many have been to college or 
 even university and are specialists in
 many fields.A number of farmer's sons 
 in this locality have brought new     
 ideas and methods back after a spell  
 at college.Some farms have even got   
 into the computer age.                
 On my farm of 330 acres (which is     
 larger than average in size) we have  
 tractors of up to 200 horse power.We  
 have, amongst other machinery, our own
 combine harvester,baler,forager,manure
 and fertiliser spreaders,drill,fork   
 lift truck and trailers.              
 248 head of cattle are kept,83 of     
 these being a herd of milking         
 cows.1140 litres of milk is produced  
 daily which is collected by a tanker  
 and taken to a dairy in Northallerton 
 7 miles away.                         
 Sheep are reared principally for meat.</content>
