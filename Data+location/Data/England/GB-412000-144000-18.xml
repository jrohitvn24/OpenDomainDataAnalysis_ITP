		<title>18THE ANNUAL GUN RUN</title>
		<content> THE GUN RUN IS HELD EVERY YEAR, IN    
 JUNE. THIS IS WHEN TEAMS OF SOLDIERS  
 PULL A 25 POUNDER GUN. THERE ARE ABOUT
 16 SOLDIERS ON EACH. THERE ARE ALSO   
 CADETS AND JUNIOR SOLDIERS,WHO TAKE   
 PART IN THE CONTEST.THE ROUTE OF THE  
 GUN RUN STARTS AT AN ARMY TRANSIT CAMP
 CALED WESTDOWN, NEAR TILSHEAD. THE GUN
 RUN IS ALL ACROSS LARKHILL RANGE      
 ROADS.THERE ARE SEVERAL CHECK POINTS  
 THE TEAMS HAVE TO GO THROUGH. AT EACH 
 OF THESE THEY MAKE SURE THE TEAMS HAVE
 NOT CHANGED ANY MEN AND SO THE        
 COMMENTATOR CAN GIVE A ROUGH GUIDE AS 
 TO HOW LONG THE TEAM HAVE TAKEN TO    
 COMPLETE THAT STAGE. VARIOUS BACK-UP  
 TEAMS GIVE WATER OR ORANGES TO THE MEN
 PULLING THEIR GUNS. THE FINISH OF THE 
 GUN RUN IS AT THE OFFICERS MESS AT THE
 SCHOOL OF ARTILLERY, WHERE THERE'S A  
 FETE FOR THE ARMY FAMILIES.
