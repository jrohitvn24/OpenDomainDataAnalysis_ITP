		<content> The seasonal influx of holidaymakers  
 provides employment for people in the 
 hotel and catering industries,but less
 so than in neighbouring Hastings.The  
 Hastings language schools import      
 thousands of foreign students from    
 Continental Europe in Summer.They     
 bring revenue to the town and its     
 transport system which benefits       
 St.Leonard's also,for host families   
 there provide accommodation for the   
 students,too.There is some arable and 
 livestock farming,light industry      
 including a timber yard,a dairy,a road
 haulage depot,a toolmakers,electrical 
 and metal goods manufacturers and     
 distributors,an auction room and      
 antique shops.At Bulverhythe are a    
 British Rail servicing and a Council  
 depots.Nearby the former trolleybus   
 depot stores liquid propane gas.Shops 
 and old people's homes employ many.   </content>
