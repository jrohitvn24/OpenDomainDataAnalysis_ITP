		<title>17ST.MARTINS PIT MOUNT</title>
		<content> In{1968 Ifton Colliery}in{St.Martins  
 was closed down by the coal board     
 because of a fault in the mine.{Three 
 shale tips were left and in{1975}the  
 council{reclaimed}the land.They       
 planted{grass}and{trees}such as       
 oak,beech,maple and elm.They also put 
 in a{waterfall}as part of the drainage
 and marked{public footpaths.}The area 
 was opened to the public in{1978}and  
 to remember that, there is a plaque at
 the bottom of one mount,and at the    
 bottom of another one there is an old 
 coal truck mounted on a block.        
                                       
 When you stand at the top of the{pit  
{mount}you have a really nice{view.}You
 can see Lord Trevor's House, Chirk,   
{Stan's Shop, St.Martins Parish Church,
{Ifton Heath}and some of{Rhyn Park     
{School.
