		<title>02TOWN,BEACH'S AND DOCKS</title>
		<content>   I would describe the town as quite a
 big place and quite a busy place      
 especially on Thursday evening that is
 the main shopping day.Holiday makers  
 and sight see'ers are attracted to the
 town,especially late season looking   
 for souviners and other charms.       
      There are many quite differant   
 shops in the town some that sell      
 clothes,newspapers,confectionary and  
 other interesting things.             
   BEACHES.                            
        In Falmouth there are four     
 very nice beaches which consists of   
 Swanpool,Gyllingvase,Tunnel and       
 Castle.Gyllingvase is the best beach  
 because there aren't any rocks at all 
 unlike the others.                    
   DOCKS                               
        The docks is a very busy place.
