		<content> My name is Joel Richard Evans. I      
 live in Belvoir House in Herm, the    
 second smallest of the Channel        
 Islands. There are four people in my  
 family. My dad is the island carpenter
 and my mum is the manageress of the   
 beach cafes. My brother Jake comes to 
 school with me.                       
 My name is  Tom Stenhouse. My daddy   
 is an engineer. I live up the road    
 from school. My family has four people
 and one dog called Paddy.             
 My name is Faith Bagnall. I live      
 just up the road from the school. My  
 daddy works on the farm, he milks the 
 cows. My mummy is the school cleaner.
