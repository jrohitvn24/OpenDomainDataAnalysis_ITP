		<content>  KIRMINGTON AIRPORT (HUMBERSIDE)      
                                       
 Several local businessmen find it     
 extremely useful.                     
 Generally happy with the size of the  
 airport at the moment but people are  
 afraid of further developments.       
 Some feel that ratepayers money has   
 been wasted by the local council.     
 It has made houses more difficult to  
 sell in Kirmington.                   
 Local farmers have lost valuable      
 farming land and fear loss of even    
 more.                                 
 Most people do not feel there is much 
 scope for further expansion.          
 Many people of the village have used  
 the holiday flights to Jersey.
