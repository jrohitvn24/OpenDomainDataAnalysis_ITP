		<content> At 1.15p.m.we come back to the        
 classroom.Then we go over to watch    
 "A Place to Live"on T.V.It's about    
 insects and animals and it is very    
 interesting.At about 2.30p.m.we have  
 Craft with Mr.Watson.At the moment we 
 are making baskets.School ends at 3.35
 p.m.for most people,but for me it ends
 at 4.15 because I stay for table      
 tennis.By the time I get home it is   
 4.30p.m.I get changed into my playing 
 clothes and go out to play on my bike 
 around the streets.At 5.30p.m.it's    
 time for tea.After tea I go back out. 
 At 7.20p.m.I come in and change into  
 my shorts and tracksuit and at 7.40   
 p.m.I am ready to go to table tennis  
 at Oxstalls School.I get there for    
 7.55p.m.At 9.30p.m.we finish table    
 tennis and play handball.Then at 10.00
 p.m.my dad comes and picks me up.I get
 home at about 10.15p.m.and go to bed. </content>
