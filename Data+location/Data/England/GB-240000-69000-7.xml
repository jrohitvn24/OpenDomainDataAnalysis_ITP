		<content>       There  is  a  Telephone Exchange
 right next to  our school. Until about
 seven  years  ago   the  numbers  were
 Gunnislake but now it  has switched to
 Tavistock. At Metherell, their numbers
 have  been  changed  from  St. Dominic
 to Liskeard.                          
       The mail  that  we get delivered
 comes   from   either   Tavistock   or
 Callington. Today it is a  much  worse
 delivery  of  mail than  it was  a few
 years  ago.  Nowadays  there  are  two
 collections and one delivery a day but
 there used to be four collections  and
 two   deliveries  a  day.  On  top  of
 that  letters  take  a  lot longer  to
 arrive  at  the  right  houses.  Being
 down  in  the valley Gunnislake gets a
 poor television reception so  we  have
 a  television  booster  mast, but that
 doesn't get Channel Four.
