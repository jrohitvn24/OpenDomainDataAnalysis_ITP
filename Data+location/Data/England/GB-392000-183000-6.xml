		<content> There is an{Amoco Garage}on the main  
 road in Corston, owned by{Mr. Budd and
{Mr. Chandler.}Mr. Budd told us that he
 had owned it for sixteen years,       
 although there has been a garage      
 there for thirty-five years.When he   
 started, petrol was 15p. a gallon; now
 it is Â£2. He gets two hundred         
 customers on a busy day, and sells    
 Â£12,000 worth of petrol every week. He
 has six full time and four part-time  
 workers. He sells about 100 new Ford  
 cars every year, and all sorts of     
 second hand ones.                     
    The garage services and repairs    
 cars and tyres, and does M.O.T. tests.
 There is also a shop which sells      
 refreshments, to motorists.           
    Mr. Budd said he enjoyed his job,  
 and thought Ford cars were excellent.
