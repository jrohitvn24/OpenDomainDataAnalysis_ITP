 has a breakfast of toast and bacon.   
 She feeds her pet rabbit before       
 leaving for school at 8.30 a.m. She   
 arrives at school 5 minutes later. For
 lunch she has chips,sausage,a biscuit 
 and something to drink. During the    
 break she plays ball with her friends.
 She also sees her mother.             
   After school she walks to a friend's
 house and stays there for about 2     
 hours and watches television. She     
 leaves Sarah's house at about 5p.m.   
 and walks home. She has her tea of    
 lentel soup and unleavened bread. Then
 she walks back to Sarah's house where 
 she usually watches a video. Finally, 
 she goes back home where she has hot  
 chocolate and goes to bed.
