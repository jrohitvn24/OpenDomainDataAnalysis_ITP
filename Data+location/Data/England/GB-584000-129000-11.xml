		<title>11Social Survey F - Opinions</title>
		<content>   The final part of the{Social Survey}
 gave people the chance to make their  
 own comments about living in Rolvenden
 today. Here are just three of the     
 remarks made:                         
  {"Rolvenden is a super village. It   
{has been said that a village without  
{its own Vicar, School and Cricket Club
{loses its soul. We are fortunate in   
{having all three, so that we have a   
{"soul"."}                             
   "We feel that not enough is done for
 youngsters of today. We can see the   
 village growing older and older as    
 prices of property go up and more and 
 more retired people move into the     
 village."                             
  {"While it is important that certain 
{amenities should be provided it is    
{VITAL that the rural charm and village
{atmosphere should be preserved. This  
{is an exceptional village." }         </content>
