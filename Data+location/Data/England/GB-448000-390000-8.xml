		<title>08Housing in the Bramley area.</title>
		<content>{Bramley}was formerly a{farming village
 expanding when{Silverwood Colliery    
 opened.In 1985 it is a centre of      
{rapid urban development.              
  The housing in Bramley is a{mixture  
 of{old stone houses,}(mainly situated 
 around the church and shops along Main
 Street and Bawtry Road),{Victorian    
{terraced houses,}and a large post_war 
{Council estate}of brick semi_detached 
 houses which is built around the old  
 centre and easily located by their    
 tree names; Sycamore Ave, Cedar Drive 
 etc{New houses surround the outskirts.
  A similar mix of houses is evident in
 Hellaby and Maltby, (at the far side  
 of the M18 motorway).The newest houses
 reflect the change in buildings, using
 bricks, rather than stone, and a tiled
 roof instead of slates.Chimney pots   
 have disappeared, to be replaced by   
 central heating vents.                </content>
