		<title>10LANDSCAPE AND BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>{LANDSCAPE}may be said to be typical of
 N.Cornwall.  Rugged cliffs, grass-    
 topped, with fine sandy beaches below;
 fields enclosed by vegetation-covered 
 stone walls known as Cornish hedges,  
 many topped with tamarisk or valerian.
 Few trees. Part of Trevose Golf Club's
 18-hole course completes the scene -  
 plus the alarming hole, some 50m.     
 across, from a collapsed cave, near   
 the footpath to Dinas Head. {         
{BUILDINGS.}Older buildings, including 
 15th century Harlyn House with 18th   
 cent. dovecote, &amp; 18th century Trevose
 Farmhouse, are of stone under slate   
 roofs.  Similarly the older farm      
 buildings and tollhouse. Two resid-   
 ences, Mother Ivey's Cottage and      
 Cellars, were converted from 'fish    
 cellars' (from the fishing trade.)    
 Harlyn House is at present being      
 restored by its private owner.        </content>
