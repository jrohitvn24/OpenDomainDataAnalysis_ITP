		<content>   This Victorian farm is situated near
  Tendring.It has been owned by this   
 family since 1934.The farmer has two  
 sons that help him.It is a small      
 arable farm with approximately 450    
 acres-used for wheat, barley sugarbeet
 and peas.The soil is of pH 7.5, ideal 
 for these crops.The peas are used to  
 feed racing pigeons.The wheat is used 
 for making cattle food and bread.The  
 grain is used for malting.The         
 sugarbeet goes to a factory in Ipswich
 to make sugar.                        
   They have 4 tractors,and a big      
 combine harvester. The farm has 9     
 storage bins for the grain.Membership 
 of the EEC has increased his income,  
 and can therefore invest in modern    
 machinery. He no longer will burn the 
 stubble, due to new local Bye-laws.He 
 has a shredder on the back of his     
 combine harvester.                    </content>
