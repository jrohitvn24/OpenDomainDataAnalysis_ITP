		<content> The survey area is rural farm land.   
 There are two villages English Combe  
 and Newton-St-Loe.  The only other big
 cluster of buildings is Bath College  
 of Higher Education.  This used to be 
 a stately home. The whole area is part
 of the Duke of Cornwall's estate.  The
 Duke of Cornwall is Prince Charles,   
 The Prince of Wales and he is the     
 landlord.  He takes a keen interest in
 the estate, and often visits the area.
 Apart from those  working and studying
 in the college, most people earn their
 living on the farms.  There are dairy 
 herds, mostly black and white         
 Fresians.  The main crops are wheat,  
 barley and oil seed rape.
