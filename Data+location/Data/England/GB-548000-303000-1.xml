{           THE OUTWELL AREA           
  Outwell is a village that lies in the
 Fens between 2 counties ,Norfolk and  
 Cambridge. The 2 nearest towns are    
 Wisbech and Downham Market. The main  
 roads that run through the village are
 the A1122 and the A1101. Outwell got  
 it's name because of the 2 wells one  
 up the river Welle at Upwell and the  
 other one down stream at Outwell. The 
 river is now called the WellCreek and 
 it runs all the way through the       
 village. It is used all year round for
 swimming ,boating ,fishing and        
 skating.Once there was a canal that   
 ran from Outwell to Wisbech but that  
 was filled in about 15 years ago. Most
 of the land the village is used for   
 farming. Many soft fruits and         
 vegetables like strawberries and      
 potatoes are grown in the area.       </content>
