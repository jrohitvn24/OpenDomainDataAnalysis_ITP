		<content> From junction 38 of the M1 we followed
 the A637 to West Bretton past the war 
 memorial and parked opposite the      
 cricket field. Then we walked past    
 Town Farm to meet Mr. Wilkinson,who   
 had lived in the village all his life.
 He told us that the butcher's shop and
 post office building used to be a farm
 and they used to burn charcoal there. 
 Now there are only five working farms.
 Every September they have a flower    
 show in the village Institute.We      
 visited the school which has 50       
 pupils, 3 teachers and 1 helper. Most 
 children walk to school or come by    
 car. At 11 years they move on to      
 Horbury Comprehensive School. The boys
 play cricket and football, the girls  
 rounders and netball. We watched them 
 practising for sports day.
