		<title>01OUR AREA, COTEHILL</title>
		<content>   In the middle of our area is a      
 village called Cotehill.The village   
 has grown because of the Gypsum       
 quarry.The quarry isn't used any      
 more.We have estimated the population 
 is 312 people.We have a main road down
 one side of our block and a railway   
 line down the other.There is a        
 policeman in Cotehill.He lives in a   
 police station which is also where he 
 lives.There is an old quarry pond     
 which they were going to drain to make
 it into a rubbish dump.They drained it
 once then they decided it would cost  
 too much money to buy a plug for the  
 bottom. There was some trees by the   
 vicarage but a few years ago they were
 burnt down because of a bonfire which 
 got out of control.Around our village 
 and most of our area is grassland used
 for farming.
