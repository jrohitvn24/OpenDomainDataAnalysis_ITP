 Today Ottery has a population of      
 approximately 7000. Many new detached 
 semi_detached and link houses and     
 bungalows have been built on the out_ 
 skirts of the old town,and many of the
 old terraced cottages in the centre of
 the town have been modernised.The town
 is well supplied with food shops      
 D.I.Y., electrical and clothes shops  
 and gift shops, but many people shop  
 outside the town in Exeter or at cash

 health centre where five doctors hold 
 surgeries from Monday to Friday on a  
 rota system.  The cottage hospital
