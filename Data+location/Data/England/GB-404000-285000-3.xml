		<content>We decided to find out what clubs      
teenagers go to or would like to go to.
Also whether teenagers go with their   
parents to  clubs.To find this         
infomation  we did  a survey with a    
selection of teenagers in Ladywood.    
Around 52% of the teenagers attend some
sort of club.The night which teenagers 
choose to go out is on a Friday.Some go
two to three times a week to their     
clubs.Around half the teenagers go to  
their clubs with friends.The main clubs
that teenagers would like to attend and
most do attend are sports clubs and    
discoÂ£s.To cater for these demands,more
schools are open during the week to the
community and this year two of the     
biggest discoÂ£s in town started to have
special nights for the 11-16 age group.
Also in our area new sports facilities 
such as sailing and fishing clubs have 
opened recently.By E.Studley.T.Cronin. </content>
