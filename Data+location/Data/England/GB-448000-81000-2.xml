		<title>02FARMING: APPLEVIEW ORCHARD</title>
		<content>     In nine acres of land at          
{Appleview,}Beacon Alley, the owners   
 grow and sell various types of fruit. 
 They have about 400 apple trees, 200  
 pear trees, 300 gooseberry bushes, 400
 blackcurrant bushes and 4 rows of     
 blackberry bushes. The cost of        
 pesticides and care comes to several  
 hundred pounds per year.              
{BRIDGE FARM:}This interesting farm    
 along Bagwich Lane has 26 acres, and  
 the farmer rents a further 70 acres at
 Milk Pan Farm. He keeps 42 Guernsey   
 and Jersey cows.                      
     Pigs, mainly saddlebacks, are bred
 on the farm. The farmer has 142 young 
 pigs, 2 boars and some sows. When pigs
 are 8 weeks old, they are sold in     
 Salisbury Market. Pigs are well fed on
 beer from Burt's Brewery, Ventnor!    
 Kale is grown for the cows. Peacocks  
 and guinea fowl wander about the farm.</content>
