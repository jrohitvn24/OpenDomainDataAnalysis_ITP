		<title>13EROSION IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> The major source of erosion in the    
 area is the river Breamish.A possible 
 cause of the erosion are the gravel   
 works three miles or so down the      
 river.As they have extracted the      
 gravel so the river has tended to     
 erode back up .This erosion has now   
 moved several miles back up the bed of
 the river.                            
      Another cause of erosion is      
 flooding by the river.In a severe     
 flood in the winter of 84-5 a surge of
 water thought to be 6' high ran down  
 the valley ripping away huge areas of 
 bank.As well as this,the surge also   
 damaged Ingram Bridge which has only  
 just been repaired.Dramatic changes in
 the bed of the river also occurred.
