		<title>14Gadbury Bank Wood</title>
		<content> One of the most interesting things    
 about Gadbury Bank Wood is the Ancient
 British wall or fort.  It's really    
 just a heap of earth and it was made  
 to protect them from the Romans.      
 Another thing that happened was 300   
 years ago there was a witch who lived 
 there.  She was burned nearby.  The   
 wood is a very good place for wild    
 life, like foxes and squirrels.  The  
 foxes are hunted by the Hunt who own  
 the wood.  Sonetimes you can see      
 smartly dressed men on horses with    
 hounds all around them.  Some people  
 come to watch them in cars and follow 
 on foot.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
