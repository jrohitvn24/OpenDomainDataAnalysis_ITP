		<content>    {Main drainage}came to{Stodmarsh}in
 the 1980's; a sewage works was built  
 in the{Newnham Valley.}This service   
 was very good for the people because  
 before that they had{cesspools}and a  
 special lorry had to empty them. There
 are a few people that are so far out  
 of the village that they have not got 
{main drainage.}When the main drains   
 were layed there was great confusion  
 because the roads had to be closed,   
 being so narrow.                      
     There used to be a{water pump}on  
 Stodmarsh Village Green but in 1946   
 mains water was brought to the        
 village. Some people who did not have 
 water brought into their houses used a
 tap on the village green.             
{    Electricity}was brought to        
 Stodmarsh in 1954. Electricity wires  
 and{telephone}wires are still         
 over-head. There is no gas.           </content>
