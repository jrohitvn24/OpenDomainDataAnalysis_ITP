		<title>17ASHWELL CHURCH</title>
		<content> Ashwell Church was built in the 14    
 century on an earlier pre-Domesday    
 site.Its spire and tower is 53.5 m.   
 high and you can see it for miles     
 around.The church is 51m. by 70.5m.   
 and is built from clunch.This is a    
 soft local chalk.                     
 The clock faces on the tower were put 
 there in 1896.There are only 3        
 faces!It is said this is because a    
 local farmer did not want his         
 labourers "clock-watching" from the   
 fields.There are 6 bells in the tower.
 The church is famous for its {medieval
{graffitti.}An inscription in the tower
 refers to the village being hit by    
 plague during the{Black Death.}Another
 message dated 1361 tells of a great   
 storm.There is also a drawing of      
 the (pre-1666)Old St. Paul's          
 Cathedral, London. Other graffitti in 
 the soft walls are 20 Century names.  </content>
