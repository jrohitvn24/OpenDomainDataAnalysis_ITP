		<title>19BONFIRE NIGHT</title>
		<content>   We all look forward to Bonfire      
 night. First the funfair arrives on   
 the Common and the final touches are  
 put to the 25ft bonfire.              
   The evening starts with a torchlight
 procession through the village lead by
 a local band. When we reach the Common
 the people with torches stand round   
 the bonfire and chant "REMEMBER,      
 REMEMBER, THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER..."   
 then all the torches are thrown on the
 fire. The flames soon reach Guy Fawkes
 and it gets so hot we all have to move
 back.  After a firework display we    
 have hot potatoes and roast lamb rolls
 and enjoy ourselves at the funfair.   
   These bonfire celebrations were     
 started 27 years ago by a group called
 the Bonfire Boys. The Cranleigh Lions 
 now organize the event and the money  
 raised goes to the Village Community  
 fund.                                 </content>
