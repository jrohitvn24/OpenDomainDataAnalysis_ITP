		<content> Our area is mainly housing and open   
 fields except for{Holywell Dene}which 
 is a wooded area following the course 
 of the Seaton Burn in an East/West    
 direction. In the Dene there are the  
 remains of some buildings known as    
 'Gowden's Hole'. The Northumberland   
 Wildlife Trust look after 3{ponds}in  
 our area and we were given special    
 permission to visit one of them and   
 work there. We found many interesting 
 creatures and found them even more    
 interesting under the microscope. We  
 pressed flowers, identified and       
 labelled them. We all feel that{      
{conservation}is very important to     
 protect our environment. Mr. Manchee  
 of the County Planning Dept. explained
 the importance of planting the right  
 kind of trees to encourage wildlife.  
 We have been able to adopt a piece of 
 woodland and care for it.             </content>
