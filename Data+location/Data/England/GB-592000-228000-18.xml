		<content>  Food is one of the main things in    
 life. In our village of Fordham we can
 buy most of the food we need. We have 
 a{General Stores}which sells fresh    
 bread and vegetables. They also sell  
 all the other necessities, like tinned
 food and frozen food.Another shop in  
 the village is the{butchers}which     
 sells lots of different kinds of meat.
       Every Wednesday and Saturday a  
{Greengrocer's}van visits the village. 
 He sells all different kinds of fruit 
 and vegetables.If we need eggs,there  
 is a farm just up the hill.Also in    
 Fordham there is an{egg farm}where the
 workers sell eggs. Regularly every    
 Thursday a fish and chip van comes to 
 the village.                          
            In the village there are   
 some allotments.These are useful to   
 people for growing extra vegetables,  
 especially if their garden is small.  </content>
