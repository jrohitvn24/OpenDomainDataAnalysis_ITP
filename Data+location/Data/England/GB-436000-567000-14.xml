		<title>14THE SHIELDS GAZETTE</title>
		<content> The local evening newspaper is{The    
{Shields Gazette}which is one of the   
 oldest provincial newspapers in the   
 country. It was established in 1849.  
 News of international and             
 national importance is carried in "The
 Gazette" but news of local concern to 
 the people of North and South Shields 
 and South Tyneside fills much of the  
 paper.                                
 The present Editor,{Mr.M.J.Blackah,}  
 told us that the main concern of his  
 readers is the high level of          
 unemployment in the area. He thinks   
 that we are beginning to pull out of  
 the recession but it will take a long 
 time.                                 
 The wide coverage makes "The Shields  
 Gazette" a very popular newspaper.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
