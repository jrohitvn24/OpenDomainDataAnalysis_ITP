		<content> employed on the line though only 5 are
 fully employed all year.Alot of people
 are interested in the railway and work
 for nothing on the line.This includes 
 work on maintenance and repairs as    
 well as driving trains and operating  
 signals.The journey from Minehead to  
 Bishops Lydeard takes about one hour  
 by diesel and one and a half hours by 
 steam.It takes a bit longer by steam  
 as the train has to stop to take on   
 extra water.
