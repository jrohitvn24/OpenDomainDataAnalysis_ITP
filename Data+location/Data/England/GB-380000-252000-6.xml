		<title>06POPULATION MOVEMENT,ST JOHNS</title>
		<content> The residential suburbs,south of St   
 Johns,are mainly owner occupied houses
 with a few Army married quarters.A    
 third of all the houses are post      
 1960,&amp; lie mainly in Lower Wick.      
 There is considerable movement in the 
 property market,with a large          
 proportion of newcomers to the area.  
 A survey conducted among 200 families 
 showed that 65% of the heads of family
 were born outside Worcester;of        
 these,33% came from Hereford &amp;        
 Worcester County;23% from Birmingham &amp;
 the Midlands;15% from the North of    
 England;10% from Wales,Scotland &amp;     
 Ireland &amp; 9% from London &amp; the Home   
 Counties.                             
 The main reason for moving to         
 Worcester was employment,many seeking 
 jobs here because they liked the area 
 Several Army families have bought     
 their own homes on leaving the Service</content>
