		<title>16A NEW RAILWAY</title>
		<content> A new feature in the landscape to the 
 south and west of Thorpe Willoughby is
 the main east coast diversion of the  
 railway from London King's Cross to   
 Edinburgh. This rail diversion is not 
 shown on contemporary O.S. maps.      
                                       
 As a result of this diversion Selby   
 has lost its status as a stop on the  
 Inter-City route. Passengers now have 
 to travel to York or Doncaster to     
 connect with the main line. However,  
 the new line cuts down journey times  
 from York to London and it is the     
 first new main line to be built in    
 Britain for 60 years.                 
                                       
 The railway had to be diverted because
 of the new Selby coalfield which      
 undermines the old route. The new     
 track is 12 miles long,has 14 new road
 bridges and cost over Â£2 million.     </content>
