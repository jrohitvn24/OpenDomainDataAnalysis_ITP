		<title>14Broughton Village (2)</title>
		<content>  There are one or two interesting     
features to the village as well as the 
castle.                                
  The {Parish Church} is called Saint  
Mary Broughton with North Newington    
and it is in the castle grounds. On the
main road are four {Almshouses} which  
were built in 1859 by Miss Elizabeth   
Wyatt for poor people. They are still  
run by Trustees and not owned by       
anyone. The houses are built of stone  
but have been recently modified
