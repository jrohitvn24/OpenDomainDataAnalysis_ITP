		<title>05DERBYSHIRE CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content>{ Derbyshire County Cricket Club}was   
 formed in 1873. The County Ground in  
 Derby was first used as a race course 
 and later as the headquarters for     
 Derby County football team. A new     
 pavillion called the{Lund Pavillion}  
 has just been built. It has a bar,    
 physiotherapy room, changing rooms and
 a restaurant. Around the ground are   
 boards with sponsors' names on them.  
 As cricket crowds have declined{      
{sponsorship}has become an important   
 part of the game. Sponsors help pay   
 the players' wages.                   
  One of Derbyshire's famous cricketers
 is{Bob Taylor}who was England's wicket
 keeper for many years. He still holds 
 the record for test match dismissals  
 by a wicket keeper.                   
  Derbyshire also play at Chesterfield,
 Heanor and Buxton. They play three day
 matches and one day matches.          </content>
