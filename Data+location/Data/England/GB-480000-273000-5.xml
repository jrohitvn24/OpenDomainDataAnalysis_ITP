		<content>OUR CLASS DID A SURVEY TO SHOW THE AGE 
OF OUR HOUSES.HERE IS OUR CHART:

86-185 : 4 houses  286+   :3 houses    
WE CAN SEE FROM THE CHART THAT MOST OF 
THE HOUSES WE LIVE IN WERE BUILT IN THE
TWENTIETH CENTURY.OF THE THREE HOUSES  
OLDER THAN 286 YEARS, TWO WERE BUILT IN
1650 AND ONE WAS BUILT IN 1620.WE KNOW 
THAT BROUGHTON IS OLDER THAN 1620,     
BECAUSE THE CHURCH WAS BUILT IN THE    
TWELFTH CENTURY AND BROUGHTON WAS      
MENTIONED IN THE DOMESDAY BOOK.IN 1981 
THE POPULATION WAS 1,422.THE NEW ESTATE
HAS BROUGHT MORE PEOPLE.HERE IS THE
