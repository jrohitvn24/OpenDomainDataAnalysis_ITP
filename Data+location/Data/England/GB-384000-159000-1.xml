		<title>01WALKS AROUND HOLT</title>
		<content> The village of Holt is surrounded by  
 lots of beautiful countryside. There  
 are many slopes that you can climb,   
 which have fascinating views of Holt. 
 There are lovely trees and hedgerows  
 full of wild flowers. There are lots  
 of quiet roads for you to wander along
 once you are out of the main part of  
 the village. There are many footpaths 
 in and around Holt. Although most of  
 them are marked on maps, quite often  
 they are not very easy to find. An    
 example is the footpath that leads    
 from Leigh Road to Hunt's Hall Farm.  
 When you get over the stile, it is    
 impossible to see which way you are   
 meant to go. At the other side of the 
 field, there isn't even a stile and   
 you have to go over a barbed-wire     
 fence. Most of the other footpaths are
 better than this, because they are    
 used more often.                      </content>
