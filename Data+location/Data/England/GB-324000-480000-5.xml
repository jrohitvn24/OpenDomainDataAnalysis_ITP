		<title>05FARMING</title>
		<content>   Mr. Robert Phillipson came to talk  
 to us about some of the changes in    
 farming that he had experienced.Before
 World War Two every farmer used horses
 to plough and pull any machinery they 
 used. Every farm had farm servants,   
 both men and women,that is the reason 
 why many farmhouses are so large as   
 the servants all lived in the farm.   
   There were hiring fairs at Ulverston
 at Martinmas and Whitsuntide.Any young
 man or girl who wanted to be hired put
 a piece of hay or straw in their hat.A
 farmer who wanted a servant would talk
 to them and then he might hire them   
 for six months. Nowadays most farms   
 are worked by the farmer and his      
 family.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
