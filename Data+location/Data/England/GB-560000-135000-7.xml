		<title>07Rawson's Cars and Caravans</title>
		<content>  The man that we interviewed was very 
 helpful. On average he said he sold   
{175 cars a year.}The very popular cars
 were those with space in the back and 
 economical cars. {Caravans}were very  
 popular in the summer.   He did get   
 sporty cars in stock as well.         
  People come from roughly a 15-mile   
 (25km) radius to buy cars at Rawson's.
 They have a{variety of vehicles}from  
 Range Rovers to Minis.   They would   
 usually sell about 8 caravans and 6 to
 7 used cars a week. People who come to
 buy caravans come from almost         
 everywhere.                           
  When a car breaks down they do all   
 they can to offer{good service}to     
 encourage the people to use the firm  
 again.  Mr Rawson owns the company and
 he lives in Mayfield Lane, Wadhurst.  
 He once gave a party for all the      
 employees of Rawson's.                </content>
