		<title>09HILTON HOUSE AND BRINSOP</title>
		<content>   {Hilton House}is a linear           
 development along the{A6}Manchester to
 Preston road. It consists almost      
 entirely of terraced houses which were
 built for the colliers who worked in  
{Brinsop Pit.}This closed in the       
 mid-nineteen twenties during the Great
 Depression.                           
    The{Brinsop Arms}has been greatly  
 altered during the last five years,   
 having extended into the adjacent     
 cottages to make it an attractive bar 
 restaurant. The{Royal Oak}public house
 dates back to the eighteenth century  
 when it was a coaching inn on the     
{Manchester/Preston}road. It has       
 recently been renovated and has lost  
 much of its 'olde worlde' charm.      
  {Brinsop Hall Farm}works to conserve{
{butterflies,}buying them in the       
 chrysalis stage and releasing them    
 in a nearby meadow.                   </content>
