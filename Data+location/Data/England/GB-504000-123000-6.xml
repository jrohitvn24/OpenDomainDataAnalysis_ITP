		<title>06SCHOOL DAY IN WIS. GREEN</title>
		<content> I get out of bed, take my  pyjamas off
 and get dressed.  I have my breakfast,
 then get my coat and shoe bag ready.  
 I come to school, put my bag on my peg
 and sit down and read until the       
 teacher says"Stop". We go to P.E. when
 we climb ropes and do gymnastics on   
 the apparatus.  After P.E. we have a  
 bottle of milk to drink and we go out 
 to play in the playground.  After play
 sometimes we do sums and sometimes we 
 write in our English books and        
 sometimes we watch a school TV        
 programme. Some children work on the  
 computer.  At 12 noon we go to the    
 toilet and wash our hands.  We then   
 line up and cross the road to the     
 canteen and we have our lunch.  If it 
 is sunny we play on the school field. 
 We do more work then have another     
 playtime at 2.30 p.m. The teacher     
 reads us a story until hometime.      </content>
