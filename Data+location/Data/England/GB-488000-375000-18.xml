		<title>18Ecology of Saxilby Area</title>
		<content> Wild flowers  are  restricted  in  the
 Saxilby area but we still have violets
 ,  cowslips, milkmaids and buttercups.
 There are several bee keepers. Gardens
 with mature trees and clumps of  small
 trees and shrubs provide a habitat for
 birds. The banks of the River Till are
 peaceful and visited by herons, swans,
 coots,  moorhens and ducks. The latter
 enjoy the weeds the fishermen dislike.
 Fish include pike, roach, perch, tench
 , gudgeon, bream and eels. A few frogs
 and newts have been seen. On the  open
 farmland  the wildlife is as one would
 expect in  an  intensively  cultivated
 arable  area  -  foxes, rabbits, hares
 (becoming scarcer) and  small  mammals
 supplying  food  for  tawny  owls  and
 kestrels.  Pheasants,  partridges  and
 hundreds of lapwings inspect the newly
 ploughed soil. Soon thousands of noisy
 starlings will arrive for winter.     </content>
