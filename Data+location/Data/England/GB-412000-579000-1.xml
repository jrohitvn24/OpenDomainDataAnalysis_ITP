		<title>01WHALTON, NORTHUMBERLAND.</title>
		<content> Whalton is an attractive Northumbrian 
 village of grey sandstone houses,     
 built on either side of the Morpeth_  
 Belsay road, the B6524. It lies 18    
 miles to the northwest of Newcastle   
 upon Tyne and 6 miles to the          
 southwest of Morpeth, County Town of  
 Northumberland. The population of     
 Whalton village is around 160. There  
 is a village green surrounded by posts
 and chains on the north side of the   
 road and it is here that the annual   
 Baal Fire is held. The focal points   
 of village life are the shop, the     
 village hall, the church and the pub. 
 The village is surrounded by fairly   
 flat intensively farmed open          
 countryside and agriculture is the    
 most important aspect of life for this
 community.
