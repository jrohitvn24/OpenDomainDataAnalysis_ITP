   Lorries take it to the sugar_beet   
 factory for it to be refined.  The end
 product of sugar_beet is sugar.  Its  
 other use is cattle feed called beet  
 pulp.  A sugar_beet is round long and 
 pointed.                              
   We plant potatoes from april onwards
 by both hand and machine.  We use a   
 fertilizer to help them grow. We would
 need to irregate in a dry summer with 
 high preasure pumps. When ready for   
 gathering, the potatoes have more than
 one potato on each root.  We harvest  
 the potatoes from September onwards.  
 They are kept in potato stores, which 
 are insulated and well ventilated and 
 then gased later to stop them from    
 chitting (which means to stop them    
 having shoots).  The potatoes are sold
 for chips, crisps, smash and household
 eating.                               </content>
