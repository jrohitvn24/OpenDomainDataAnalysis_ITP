		<title>07GENERAL QUARRYING,TREVERVA</title>
		<content> Although many of the quarries are     
 disused there are still two working   
 quarries in the area.                 
   Granite is quarried and is taken in 
 lorries from the blasting site to the 
 processing quarry.There the granite is
 cut into 40mm slabs by a machine,that 
 is computer programmed.The blades of  
 the cutter are made of diamonds and   
 these need to be retipped every 3 to 4
 weeks.This costs Â£4,000.              
  After being cut the granite is       
 polished on its face side.Any pieces  
 of granite with faults are sold       
 cheaply for garden patios and         
 driveways.Any waste is put on a       
 tip.The disused quarries can be an    
 eyesore on the landscape.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
