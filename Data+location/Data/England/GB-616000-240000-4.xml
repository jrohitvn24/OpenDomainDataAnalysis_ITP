		<content>The large residential areas in         
South-east Ipswich are being improved  
steadily.An example is the 'Racecourse'
area,where Ipswich Borough Council take
old housing and renovates the area     
rather than deciding to demolish it and
start again.                           
  The local council made the decision  
to renovate rather than  demolish to   
improve the quality of life in an area 
without causing too much disturbance.  
Small areas are taken at a time        
(Packard Arenue is currently being     
improved),the residents are            
temporarily moved to other areas.      
The houses are gutted, new windows and 
roofs are obvious features, but basic  
indoor facilites are also replaced.    
  The area is pleasent and is improving
over time,not decaying.
