		<title>15FRISKNEY FEAST DAY</title>
		<content> The Chapel Sunday School anniversary  
 is celebrated in June. It is called   
 Feast Day or Wagon Day and is held on 
 the second Monday of the month. The   
 days events were originally just for  
 the Sunday School children but it     
 bcame so popular that now all the     
 village children can take part and the
 village primary school is officially  
 closed for the day.There must be very 
 few schools in Lincolnshire nowadays  
 which have a holiday based on an old  
 custom such as this. The children are 
 conveyed around the village in        
 decorated drays pulled by carthorses  
 which themselves are decorated for the
 occasion. Such wagons and horses are  
 rare these days. Afterwards the       
 children have tea followed by games.
