		<title>14SCHOOL'S 125th ANNIVERSARY</title>
		<content> On 19/7/85 Northleaze Primary School  
 celebrated its 125th Anniversary. All 
 the staff and children dressed in     
 Victorian costume. The girls wore dark
 dresses and white aprons, and the boys
 short trousers. Their work was        
 displayed in the Hall and in all the  
 classrooms. The public were able to   
 wander around seeing Victorian-style  
 lessons in progress. Mrs Martin,      
 Chairman of the School Governors was  
 dressed as Lady Smyth, an important   
 school benefactor, and came in a      
 horse-drawn carriage. The classes     
 all followed a Victorian curriculum,  
 including drill and maypole dancing.  
 The lunch was soup, salad, bread,     
 cheese and gingerbread. Some children 
 played recorders. Others did country  
 dancing and singing. At the end of    
 the day everyone sang the National    
 Anthem. It was a day to remember!     </content>
