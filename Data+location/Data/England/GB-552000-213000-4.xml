		<title>04My Journey to School</title>
		<content> I say goodbye to my gran and set off  
 down the long gravel drive.  I stop   
 for a moment to look for the baby     
 ducks and their mum on the pond.  I   
 walk slowly through the dew-laden     
 grass.  The dog next door comes       
 running down his drive to greet me.   
 The next person I meet is an old      
 gardener who always says hello.  The  
 rest of the journey is on my own until
 I get to Clipped Hedge where I meet my
 friend, Kate.  A beautiful cottage is 
 next on the route.  Coming round the  
 corner, a terrific smell is lurking in
 wait for us - the abattoir.  But a    
 familiar sight is soon - the well kept
 Heath.  We walk by the shops and three
 pubs.  The post office is a must for  
 most school children and we stop for a
 while.  The shouts and laughter from  
 the playground is a welcoming sound   
 and we arrive and meet our friends.   </content>
