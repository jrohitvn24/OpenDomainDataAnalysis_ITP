		<title>06ST. MICHAEL'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> St. Michael's Church stands apart from
 the modern village of Sunninghill at  
 the end of a leafy lane.There has     
 been a church here for over a thousand
 years. On 9th July 1985 a new church  
 hall was opened by the Bishop of      
 Oxford.The hall is linked to the      
 church by a covered walk which has    
 been designed to blend in with the    
 church architecturally.It is          
 approximately 16m long and 6m wide and
 is a single stoney construction.The   
 hall cost Â£52,000 to build and furnish
 and will be used for Sunday school    
 meetings and other Church groups.     
 The site of the new hall was a very   
 old graveyard and it took many months 
 to clear the ground ready for         
 building.
