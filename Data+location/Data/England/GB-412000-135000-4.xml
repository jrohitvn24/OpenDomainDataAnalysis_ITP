		<title>04DISTRICT COUNCILLOR (2)</title>
		<content>     The District Councillor in our    
 parish is called Mrs Down.            
     Mrs Down does not have many       
 complaints or problems. However she   
 has one big problem that often comes  
 up: it is about homeless people whom  
 she has to help.                      
     She has another problem which     
 annoys her and this problem is about  
 people wanting to build a {ring road} 
 around{Salisbury}and through the{     
{Woodford Valley. }I think it is sad to
 spoil this beautiful valley with a    
 horrible noisy {Ring Road,}and I hope 
 it will be built around the South of{ 
{Salisbury.}                           
{  }
