		<content> We interviewed about 70 people in the 
 shopping areas of Dunstable.          
   Most people seemed to be satisfied  
 with the facilities in the area, quite
 a few thought they were good, and only
 a few considered them poor.           
   Almost everyone thought that the    
 shopping areas could be made cleaner, 
 or more attractive.                   
   Most people thought that food shops 
 in Dunstable were good, and you could 
 buy what you wanted.                  
   Most people shop in Dunstable to buy
 food. Many bought clothes and         
 household goods.                      
   Many people shop weekly, others two 
 or three times a month.               
   Half of the people didn't think     
 there should be more local post       
 offices, and the other half thought   
 there should. Many people shopped in  
 other towns.                          </content>
