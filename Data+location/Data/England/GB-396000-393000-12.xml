		<content>     The original village was situated 
on top of the hill near to the church. 
No visible remains exist of the        
structure apart from uneven areas of   
ground.                                
     As the turnpike roads were built  
and as industry came to the valley     
houses were needed for the influx of   
workers.  The older weaving cottages   
were used as lodging houses, but the   
local quarries were able to provide    
good supplies of gritstone for both    
building and tiling.  This allowed the 
rapid development of stone built       
cottages, which give a characteristic  
feure of the area to this day.
