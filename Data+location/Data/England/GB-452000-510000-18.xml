		<title>18LANGUAGE AND DIALECT</title>
		<content> Very little real dialect is still used
 in Ayton, except "thoo", meaning "thou
 or you", is still used by some older  
 residents.  A general tendency to use 
 a short "a" as in "cat" for such words
 as "grass", and a long "u" as in      
 "took" for such words as "cut" is     
 common throughout the north.  Local   
 place names have been devised, such as
 "Cooks" for Easy Moor to the east of  
 the area.  Final consonants tend to   
 vanish, so "Tunstall" becomes         
 "Tunst'l".  Great Ayton is known      
 locally as "Canny Yatton", meaning big
 or fine Ayton.  "Yat" is Scandanavian,
 meaning "gate" or "pass", as through a
 range of hills.  "Langbaurgh" is a    
 Saxon word meaning "long barrow" as   
 mistakenly given to the basalt ridge  
 to the north of the village.
