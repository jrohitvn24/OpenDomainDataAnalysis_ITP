		<title>10Landscaped Cemetery</title>
		<content> On the 20th of June I went with a     
 group to tour Cockermouth Cemetery.   
 I know it is a tourist attraction as  
 it is more of a landscaped park than a
 burial place.                         
 The manager showed us records in his  
 office. First record: June 1856 and   
 133 burials in that year. 1985: 35_50 
 predicted. In the years of 'flu       
 epidemics coffins were brought by     
 horse and cart for burial by lantern. 
 He took us round. We saw 20 varieties 
 of trees, limes,flowering cherries,yew
 copper beech and holly. As the seasons
 change there are carpets of snowdrops,
 crocuses,miniature daffodils,primroses
 down by the beck. The old part has few
 headstones. Most ornate is that of a  
 Travelling Fair man known locally as  
 "Biddall", who died at Cockermouth    
 Fair. The new ground extension will be
 consecrated by the Bishop in 1987.    </content>
