 been the end of the year long miners'{
{strike.}The strike ended on March 5   
 with the miners of Woolley Colliery   
 grouping together and marching back to
 the mine under the Union banner.One   
 recent visitor to Yorkshire was Dr.   
 Billy Graham an American evangelist.  
 Lots of people travelled from our     
 local area to hear him preach in      
 Sheffield.                            
 For the first time ever this year     
 Barnsley organised a half{marathon    
 road race,routed through Kexbrough and
 Cawthorne.The streets were lined with 
 people cheering the competitors       
 along.Annual events which are popular 
 in the area include a Craft Fair at   
 the High School and{galas}at Darton   
 and Kexbrough.A new link road between 
 Darton and Barugh was opened in 1985.
