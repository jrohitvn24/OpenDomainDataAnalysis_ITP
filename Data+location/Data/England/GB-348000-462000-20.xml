		<content>Since the improvement of the centre    
swimming has become a lot more popular 
increasing by over 50% up and the      
sports centre is a great success. As   
yet there is still more work to be done
They are working on a new energy saving
roof for the swimming pool. This will  
help to save money and heat,for the    
roof above the the swimming pool now   
lets out to much heat and uses a lot of
money that could be used in a better   
way. The swimming pool contains 123,354
gallons of water. Around the swimming  
pool there are seats for 400 spectators
The temperature of the water in the    
pool is 82  degrees F. The water is    
never changed but runs out of the pool 
all the time to a filter pump. Where   
it is cleaned, it then goes to another 
pipe where it is heated then from      
there it runs back into the pool.
