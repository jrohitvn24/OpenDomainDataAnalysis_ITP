		<title>08ARMED FORCES AROUND ASHILL</title>
		<content> Ashill being quite near several{R.A.F.
 bases (Watton,Swanton Morley,Marham)  
 and{U.S.A.F.}bases (Lakenheath,Milden-
 hall) is regularly overflown by       
 military aircraft.The parents of young
 children quite often complain about   
 noise and danger from these low-flying
 planes because some children are too  
 frightened to play outside because of 
 the noise. The main offenders appear  
 to be Tornadoes, Jaguars (RAF) and    
 A10's, F111 (USAF). The village is    
 also quite close to the{Stanford      
{Battle Area}(an army training ground) 
 and it is not unusual to have loud    
 "BANGS" shaking the house, military   
 helicopters fly overhead and in the   
 evenings parachute flares light up the
 sky to the S.W. RAF Hercules aircraft 
 sometimes "hedge-hop" over the village
 before climbing rapidly over the area 
 spilling out hundreds of{parachutists.</content>
