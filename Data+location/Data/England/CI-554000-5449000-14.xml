		<content>   As further north in the bay, the    
 sands of beach and lower dunes conceal
 a buried peat layer.  Normally this is
 not visible but is quite often exposed
 not so may yards from the sea wall at 
 less than a metre depth.  In places   
 the remains of tree stumps such as    
 alder can be seen.  This peat has     
 recently been dated by use of Carbon  
 14 to some 2000 years B.C.  On        
 occasion sherds of prehistoric        
 pottery, mainly of Neolithic age, have
 been found.  These peats, referred to 
 as "buried forests", capture the      
 public imagination though the range of
 ideas about them is quite startling.  
                                       
   The rocks are sedimentary rocks of  
 great age and supply the black pebbles
 found along the base of the sea wall.
