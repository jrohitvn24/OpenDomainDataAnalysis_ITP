		<content> William Kempe,of Spains Hall wrongly  
 accused his wife so vowed to be silent
 for 7yrs and dig a fishpond each year.
   "The Raven",a 7th son of a 7th son  
 prophesied disaster.The 1st year three
 servants died in the pond.Next year   
 his wife died.The 3rd year he wouldn't
 call out when thrown from his horse.  
   The last year riding from Halstead, 
 he overheard plans to rob Spains Hall,
 as he sheltered from a dreadful storm.
   Stopped by a swollen river,still    
 refusing to speak,he sent his servant 
 with a written message to swim.However
 the message was washed away and allthe
 servants not understanding set out to 
 look for William leaving only one     
 small boy to guard the house.         
    The thieves murdered the boy and   
 ransacked the house.Some say William  
 died silent,others that a preacher    
 finally persuaded him to pray.        </content>
