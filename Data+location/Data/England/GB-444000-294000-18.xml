		<content>      Of the 1034 houses in the area,  
 only a small proportion of them       
 reflect the origins of the area, these
 being largely concentrated around the 
 centre of the village of Barwell.     
      Newer developments are           
 concentrated in three main areas:     
{(i) Council Property.}A substantial   
 post-war estate was built to          
 accomodate the rising population and  
 to home mining families in the area.  
{(ii)Private Housing.} Considerable    
 estates have been developed since the 
 1960s to house local workers and      
 commuters.                            
{(iii)Coventry Housing Association.}An 
 expanding estate owned by the Assoc.  
 provides accomodation for a wide      
 variety of groups.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
