is bricked up in the beer cellar.A     
secret passage is supposed to run under
Artlebeck up in Jenkins wood.A man and 
woman are thought to have been murdered
under the weeping ash,a tree in the    
grounds.The ghost of a monk walks the  
passages and bedclothes are removed    
mysteriously from people sleeping in   
certain rooms.                         
  The ghost of a 17th century lady is  
said to walk from the Black Bull Inn to
St. PaulÂ£s church yard.On the path to  
Forge Bridge there is a ring of
