		<title>17MILTON REGIS</title>
		<content> Milton Regis,in its heyday,was more   
 important than Sittingbourne.'Regis'  
 means'of the King'and it was a royal  
 manor visited by Kings of England.In  
 1984 a Mediaeval Fair recreating the  
 past was so successful that it was    
 repeated this year,1985.Milton is an  
 old village and in the High Street    
 some of the buildings such as the     
 Court Hall still stand.The elderly    
 have seen farmland disappear to be    
 replaced by growing estate housing,   
 both private and council.Sadly        
 vandalism has grown with the          
 increasing population and few wedding 
 ceremonies are now performed locally  
 for fear of cars being damaged and    
 receptions being interupted,but the   
 Church is active.Milton is home to    
 many people who enjoy facilities such 
 as tennis,cricket,football.The slopes 
 on the rec.are good for sledging.     </content>
