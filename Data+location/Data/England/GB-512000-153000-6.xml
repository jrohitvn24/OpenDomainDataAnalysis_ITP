		<title>06Council estates in Bookham</title>
		<content> The district is well provided with    
 council houses dating from 1929. The  
 large{Grove}and{Middlemead}estates are
 post-war and there are smaller        
 scattered groups of houses.{Edenside} 
 provides flats, bungalows and shops   
 for the elderly. The Mole             
 Valley Council has followed Government
 policy on selling to tenants, and many
 have taken advantage. Many of the     
 Grove houses have been sold and few   
 young children live there now. Grove  
 House, formerly Council flats, has    
 been sold to developers who have built
 small units for sale.                 
 There is almost no property to let in 
 the area and there is now a severe    
 shortage of family_size council       
 houses. The increasing prosperity of  
 tenants is shown by the improvements  
 they make to the houses and the cars  
 parked in the roads.                  </content>
