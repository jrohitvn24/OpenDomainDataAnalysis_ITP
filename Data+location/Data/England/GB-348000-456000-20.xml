		<content> Three quarters of the block is        
 countryside.  The majority of this is 
 grazing land with several small woods 
 and farms.  There is a reservoir which
 is caaled Blea Tarn which supplies    
 Lancaster, Morecambe, Heysham and     
 surrounding areas. The A6 runs N-S.   
 It has a single lane on each side and 
 parallels the nearby M6.  The railway 
 runs practically alongside the A6.    
 The main feature in our block is the  
 University, completed in 1964 and six 
 years later the recreation centre was 
 opened. The univ. buildings are modern
 looking and built on a spine running  
 down the length of the Univ.  The     
 central square is called Alexandra Sq.
 after the Princess who opened it.
