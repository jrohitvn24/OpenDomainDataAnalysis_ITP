		<title>12Stubble Burning.</title>
		<content> Many people think stubble burning is  
 dangerous. Even when farmers obey all 
 the safety rules accidents may still  
 happen.Last year a farmer left his    
 tractor in one of his fields and went 
 to have his tea.The tractor engine was
 hot and set fire to the stubble.It    
 took 8 fire engines to put out the    
 fire. There are strict rules farmers  
 have to obey. Before they burn the    
 stubble they must plough and clear the
 straw from a strip all round the edge 
 of the fields so that hedges and trees
 are not damaged by the flames.They    
 must chop up the straw so that it is  
 low on the ground. They may not burn  
 the fields if the wind is strong, or  
 at weekends. Village people dislike   
 stubble burning because smuts and soot
 dirty people's houses and clothes.    
 Hedges are singed by the flames and   
 wildlife is destroyed.                </content>
