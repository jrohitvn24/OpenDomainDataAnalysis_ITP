 Basing is a parish lying to the       
 north-east of Basingstoke and covers  
 approximately 5300 acres. It is       
 watered by the River Loddon, which    
 rises west of Basingstoke and flows   
 through its subsoil of London clay and
 chalk.The river once powered  Old     
 Basing Mill, dating from the 11th     
 century.The mill has been converted   
 into an inn and restaurant. Access is 
 available to the remains of the water 
 wheel and grinding stones that were   
 used for grinding the village wheat   
 into flour.                           
     There is a Victorian viaduct which
 carries a busy railway line from east 
 to west crossing the River Loddon.    
 Basing House was under siege for two  
 years during the Civil War.
