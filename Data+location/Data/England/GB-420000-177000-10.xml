		<title>10LANDSCAPE _ RURAL WILTSHIRE</title>
		<content> This landscape is designated "an area 
 of outstanding natural beauty".  It is
 chalk downland, changing with the     
 seasons as it is mostly agricultural  
 land.  It is hilly, without deep      
 valleys, more undulating than steep   
 inclines and descents.  From high     
 vantage points a patchwork of fields  
 with occasional small copses of trees 
 can be seen.                          
 The farmhouses are surrounded by      
 outbuildings - open barns (Dutch) seem
 to be the most usual; these being     
 somewhat newer.  The older barns are  
 open-ended with weatherproof sides.   
 Amongst a variety of small buildings  
 are pig sties, chicken houses and     
 runs, dove cotes and stables for      
 horses.  Only one main B road cuts    
 through this area with a small section
 of the M4 motorway across the top     
 right hand corner.                    </content>
