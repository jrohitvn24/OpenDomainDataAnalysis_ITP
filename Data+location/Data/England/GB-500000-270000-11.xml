		<content>Hargrave Lodge Farm is owned by Mr and 
Mrs Topham.The farm has 250 acres of   
land but only 90 acres are used for    
growing. The land is mainly used for   
growing wheat and barley. Mr Topham    
has been farming for over 20 years     
although his family has been working   
on that land for 42 years. The farm has
some cows, poultry and horses. They    
have several different breeds of       
horses. They have a friesan bull and   
rear beef cattle which they send to    
market. In the house they have 2 gold- 
fish, a dog, 8 cats and a few kittens. 
The farm animals cost over a hundred   
pounds a day to feed. The animals eat  
sugar beet pulp, grass, hay, bran,     
fruit and barley. The farm is thought  
to be over 100 years old. There are    
only two workers on the farm, they are 
Mr Topham and his daughter Tracey. They
start work at 8am and finish at 6pm.   </content>
