		<title>04A farmer's day in N.Duffield</title>
		<content>{A Day On A Farm}The farmer we talked  
 to gets up at half past six in the    
 morning and goes out to milk the cows.
 The cows take one hour to be milked,  
 there are forty cows altogether.At    
 lunch break he has one hour.After     
 lunch he mostly works out in the      
 fields.The people that help him on the
 farm are self employed.Women are only 
 employed seasonally.He owns and looks 
 after two hundred and twenty acres.The
 land is used for grazing and crops.To 
 help him he has tractors,combine      
 harvesters and root crop harvesters.On
 the farm he owns heffers, beef        
 cattle and calves.Every day on the    
 farm is extremely busy.The milking is 
 very hard and so is caring for the    
 life stock.On a night in winter he    
 gets home at six 'o'clock and in      
 summer it is half past eight.
