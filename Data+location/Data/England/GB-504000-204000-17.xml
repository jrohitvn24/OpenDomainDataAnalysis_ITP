		<title>17TRANSPORT, HEMEL HEMPSTEAD</title>
		<content> Hemel Hempstead is a centre for many  
 sorts of transport because it lies on 
 the route out of London going north.  
 Nearby runs the M1 motorway which at  
 present is undergoing repairs on a    
 section and so as much traffic is     
 being diverted to other roads such as 
 A41 which passes through our area. The
 main west coast railway line passes   
 through the area with stations at both
 Hemel and Apsley that serve the many  
 commuters travelling to London each   
 day to work. The most modern          
 Inter-City passenger trains and fast  
 freight trains use the line. Although 
 it is used mainly for pleasure        
 nowadays, the Grand Union Canal has   
 been a major form of transport in the 
 past, serving the paper mills of John 
 Dickinson.
