		<content>  Our school is{King's Wood First      
 school.We have a big playground,a big 
 playing field and an orchard. Every   
 Tuesday we go swimming in the Middle  
 school pool.  When our teacher is on  
 playground duty our class is allowed  
 to play on the concrete humps and     
 benches. Recently we went on an outing
 to Thorpe Park.We had a lovely time   
 there.                                
 Lots of visitors come to our school.We
 have the community policeman who comes
 to talk to us.There is sometimes a    
 visit by the doctor or the dentist and
 sometimes the nurse comes to check our
 hair to see if we have nits.If you    
 have nits you get special shampoo to  
 wash your hair and kill the nits.     
 When the weather is fine we play on   
 the field and make daisy chains or we 
 go into the orchard to pick flowers.
