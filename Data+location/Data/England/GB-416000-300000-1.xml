		<content>The area is mainly agricultural:a      
mixture of arable farming (cereal      
crops) and dairy farming, set in the   
Bourne Brook valley.  It contains the  
villages of Drayton Bassett, Bonehill  
and parts of Fazely, Staffordshire,

The area is traversed by the A5 Roman  
Watling Street E. to W., and A453 from 
Sutton Coldfield to Tamworth S.E. to   
N.W., and the Birmingham - Fazley canal
on eastern perimeter.  Along the A5    
there are housing estates and some     
shops, and a large industrial works    
(Foseco) on the A4091, but much of the 
area is cultivated farmland, gently    
sloping, with isolated farms.  The area
around Bonehill is scheduled for future
development.  There is some building   
planned in Drayton Bassett village.
