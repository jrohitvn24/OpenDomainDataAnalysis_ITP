		<title>13STUDLEY,WARWICKSHIRE</title>
		<content> Studley is one of the most populous   
 villages in the whole country.It is   
 situated on the Alcester-Birmingham   
 road,called Ryknild St.from. Roman    
 times.It is just on the Warwickshire  
 side of the Worcs./Warks. border and  
 this has fostered an aversion to being
 swallowed up in any extension of the  
 Redditch New Town area,which has crept
 ever nearer to the border.            
 It is an old village,though it does   
 not look to be so in most areas.There 
 is a Norman nave in the church of "The
 Nativity of Our Lady" and medieval    
 rood stairs.There are the gabled      
 Castle Cottages near the church.Most  
 of the village,however,consists of    
 what appears to be between-the-wars   
 housing estates.It is nearly self     
 contained-there are schools for every 
 age and all main services plus a      
 recreation ground &amp; swimming pool.    </content>
