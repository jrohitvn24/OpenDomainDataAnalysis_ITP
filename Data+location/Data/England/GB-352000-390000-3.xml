		<title>03MORE ABOUT SUTTON DISTRICT</title>
		<content>     Sutton is the other main district 
 in our block.  This area has a lot of 
 new housing development in it, but    
 also has some of the older buildings  
 left.                                 
    Sutton district is divided into    
 areas, Sutton Heath, Sherdley,Sutton  
 Manor, Sutton Junction and Sutton     
 Leach.  Our block covers Sutton Leach 
 and a small part of Sherdley.         
    Sutton was also only fields and    
 farmhouses many years ago but now has 
 an industrial estate and many new     
 housing estates.                      
    Sutton Mill Dam is situated in     
 Sutton Leach and has recently been    
 renovated by the Groundwork Trust,    
 more details of this will be given    
 later in the pages.  Sutton has an    
 interesting old church called St.     
 Nicholas'.
