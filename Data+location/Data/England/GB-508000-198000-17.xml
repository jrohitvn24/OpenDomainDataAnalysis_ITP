		<content>This is a typical school day-a Thursday
I live in a detached house near the    
school. There are few detached houses  
in this area. Apart from 2 children in 
my class all live in semi-detached or  
terraced houses. Most houses were built
at the beginning of this century but   
mine was built in 1952. During the war 
a flying bomb fell on many houses in my
road. 22 houses were destroyed, mostly 
terraced ones. My house and the one    
next door replaced the 3 terraced ones 
which were bombed. I awake at 7.30am   
and get dressed. In our school we do   
not have to wear school uniform. About 
a third of the 201 children wear it. I 
choose to wear school uniform in the   
winter but lighter summer clothes. I   
still have sheets and blankets on my   
bed. I wish I had a duvet instead as my
bed would be easier to make. Half my   
friends have duvets. They are luckier. </content>
