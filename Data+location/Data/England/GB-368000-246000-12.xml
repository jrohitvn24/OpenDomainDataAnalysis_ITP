		<title>12Dairying at Leadon Court</title>
		<content>   Leadon Court is a dairy farm of 87  
 hectares.  This farmer is changing    
 from Shorthorn and Friesian cows to   
 Holstein because the{Marketing Board  
 pays more for the quality than the    
 amount of milk.  40% of the cattle are
 Holstein.  He breeds his own calves   
 although the 10% cut in quotas has    
 meant a reduction in the size of the  
 herd.  These cattle are kept in nearby
 pastures; outlying pastures are used  
 for silage.                           
  {Computer feeding}has now been       
 introduced and ensures that the cattle
 get a balanced diet all year.  Water  
 is supplied from the mains for dairy  
 use but drinking water is pumped from 
 the River Leadon.  It is then stored  
 in a reservoir tank.                  
   All the milk is sold to the Milk    
 Marketing Board and the farmer's milk 
 is provided by the milkman.           </content>
