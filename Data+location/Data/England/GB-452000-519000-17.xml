		<title>17SOUTH BANK MARKET</title>
		<content> The outdoor market at{South Bank}has  
 existed for many years.It was         
 originally held along the sides of    
{Lorne Terrace}but during the          
 redevelopment of South Bank a place   
 was made for it behind{Middlesbrough  
{Road}near the 'Old Mans Park'.Even    
 with the introduction of large        
 Supermarkets like{Asda}the market has 
 continued to prosper.The market is of 
 the traditional type which moves to a 
 different town each day.Residents     
 complain that the market causes a lot 
 of litter,but at the end of each day  
 the council clear the site.When the   
 new road goes through South Bank the  
 market may move its site again.
