		<title>10TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Many of the villagers have their own  
 transport but public transport is     
 still available in the village though 
 this is fairly infrequent.            
 The main bus companies that operate   
 are Trimdon Motor Services and United.
 These buses call at the village as    
 part of their main Bishop Auckland to 
 Stockton, Hartlepool, and Durham      
 routes. There are only two bus stops  
 in the village.                       
 The children who come to school from  
 the villages of Bradbury and Mordon   
 travel on a private contract bus      
 service run by Martindale's, a        
 Ferryhill company.                    
 Children travelling to the            
 Comprehensive school from the village 
 do so with 'Scarlet Band'another      
 private company on contract to the    
 Education Authority.
