		<title>08FARMING AT LANDRAKE</title>
		<content> Pound Farm in Landrake is  a two      
 hundred acre farm split by the A38    
 trunk road.It is worked by the owner  
 (Mr.Norman Brewer),his son and one    
 farm labourer.                        
 The farm livestock consists of cows,  
 calves and sheep.There are 40 South   
 Devon cows and about 150 calves.These 
 calves are known as sucklers,using the
 cows for milk although many of the    
 calves are a cross breed between a    
 Freisan cow and a Hereford bull.The   
 calves are reared for beef.Some cows  
 have one calf to feed,others four.    
 A dealer purchases the calves         
 from markets in the area.They are     
 cross breeds because there is a       
 shortage of South Devon calves for    
 sale.                                 
 There are 120 sheep,reared for their  
 meat but the wool is sold as a        
 bi-product                            </content>
