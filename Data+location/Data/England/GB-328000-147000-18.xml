		<title>18HIGHBRIDGE DOCKS NOWADAYS</title>
		<content> HIGHBRIDGE DOCKS nowadays have almost 
 disappeared.They are being rapidly    
 filled in with rubble from the        
 drainage work being carried on  in the
 town at the moment.There is quite a   
 lot to see if you look carefully,old  
 sleepers,the derelict cattle dock,the 
 Willet warehouse,and the still used   
 Bonded warehouses.The sawmills are    
 still used &amp; look just the same as old
 photos of them.At the far end of the  
 dock,where it has been filled in,you  
 can still see the old lock gates,where
 the river crossed the main A.38       
 road.Some steps,and the base of the   
 old crane still shows under the       
 brambles too.The boatyard still is in 
 use,repairing and building small      
 craft.One of the original cranes is   
 still in use in the boatyard.
