 I live in New Ollerton.I attend{Forest
{View Junior School.}It is Tuesday     
 morning. I get up at 7.30 a.m., have a
 wash and clean my teeth and then have 
 breakfast. I have toast and an orange 
 drink. After breakfast I make my bed  
 and get my things ready for school.   
 I set off at 8.30 a.m. At 8.55 a.m.   
 the bell goes and we all line up and  
 go into school.We read until it is    
 time for assembly. At assembly we sing
 songs and say prayers.After assembly  
 we go back to class and work from the 
 blackboard.When the bell goes for     
 playtime I go out and play with my    
 friends.After playtime I carry on     
 working on my target until it is time 
 for reading groups.These are little   
 groups where we all work together. At 
 11.55 a.m. the bell goes for dinner.
