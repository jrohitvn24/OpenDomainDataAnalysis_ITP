		<title>09FLORA IN THE PRESTON AREA</title>
		<content> There are many woods scattered over   
 the whole area.In addition to the     
 natural woodland a considerable amount
 of tree planting was carried out in   
 the 1880's to provide timber for fire_
 wood and fencing.As well as adding to 
 the natural beauty of the locality it 
 is invaluable today for providing good
 cover for game birds,mainly pheasant, 
 which are specially bred in captivity 
 for the shooting season.The trees are 
 a variety of deciduous and conifer and
 include oak,ash,sycamore,maple,hazel, 
 hawthorn,holly,Norway spruce,larch and
 Scots pine.Ground cover is varied and 
 consists of a wide range of wild      
 plants and flowers.Large swathes of   
 bluebells and bracken thrive in the   
 dense woodland and a few wild orchids 
 survive where crop spraying is not    
 practised.
