		<title>04Life of a Powburn shepherd</title>
		<content> My dad is a shepherd near Powburn.He  
 looks after a flock of 640 ewes, 400  
 ewe lambs and l5 tups. The ewes are   
 mules, the lambs are mules and the    
 tups are Suffolks. The busiest time of
 the year is lambing time in April.    
 This year lambing began on  28th      
 March.                                
 In the lambing season my dad gets up  
 early in the morning. Sometimes he has
 to stay up all night.The dipping is   
 in June and September for sheep scab  
 and ticks.                            
 Sales start in September.Quite a lot  
 of work is involved.Lambs have to be  
 brought in from the fields and sorted 
 out.The fatter 'wether' lambs and the 
 bestfrom the ewe lambs are sent to the
 breeding sales.Dressing sheep is for  
 the breeding sales or for showing. The
 ewe is clipped around the face and    
 neck to get rid of the 'clarts'.      </content>
