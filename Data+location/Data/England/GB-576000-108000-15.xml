		<content> The family unit of married couple with
 children living together is still     
 common.An average family has 1 or 2   
 children.Family size is often limited 
 by contraception.Most homes have at   
 least one colour television.About a   
 third have a video recorder/player.   
 Watching television is the main       
 leisure occupation.Listening to radio,
 records or cassette tapes is also     
 popular.Home computers are increasing.
 Relatively few now make their own home
 entertainment.The affluent often eat  
 at restaurants.Takeaway restaurants   
 abound.Most families have at least one
 car.Driving for pleasure is common,   
 though petrol,at Â£2 a gallon,is dear. 
 Going to pubs,ancient monuments,sport,
 beaches,friends' or relatives' houses,
 as well as on the annual fortnight's  
 holiday and daily home to work travel 
 make up most of the mileage.          </content>
