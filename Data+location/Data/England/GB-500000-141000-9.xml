		<title>09St.Catherine's Centenary</title>
		<content>  One of the main features of Bramley  
 is St.Catherine's school, which is in 
 Station Road and adjacent to the A281 
 and the now disused railway line      
 (Guildford to Horsham).               
  1985 is St Catherine's centenary     
 year. It was founded for the daughters
 of middle class Church of England     
 families. It is part boarding and part
 day. To celebrate the centenary we are
 going to Butlin's Holiday Camp at     
 Bognor.                               
  There will be a special Open Day with
 displays of work and talent. We are   
 having a new Centenary building with a
 lecture theatre and sixth form rooms. 
  The Centenary is a special event     
 because one hundred years ago         
 St.Catherine's was one of the first   
 schools for girls.                    
  There is a Centenary ball and a      
 service at Guildford Cathedral.       </content>
