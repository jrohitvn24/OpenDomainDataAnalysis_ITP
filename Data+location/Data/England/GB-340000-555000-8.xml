		<content> The "Cumberland News" for 30/8/85     
 reported that the{Sands Centre (see   
{pp.2-3)}stood to lose several thous-  
 and pounds on their Little and Large  
 and Lenny Henry shows, perhaps because
 there were too many other events in   
 the City. These included: a Ray Cooney
 farce at the 50 seat Green Room       
 Theatre on West Walls; the Victorians'
 Palace of Varieties in the City Hall; 
 the Donald Scott revue at the Stanwix 
 Arts Theatre (Art College); recitals  
 in the Cathedral and the Crown and    
 Mitre Hotel; and a Jacobite supper    
 with fiddle music and 18th century    
 dishes in the Tithe Barn.             
 Cancelled because Bitts Park is water-
 logged as a result of the wet summer, 
 the usual Fun Fair...and a projected  
 City Centre cycle race through lack of
 entries.The annual Flower Show managed
 1000 entries despite the weather!     </content>
