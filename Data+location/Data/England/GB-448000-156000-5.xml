		<content> THE DOWNS PLAY A LARGE PART IN THE    
 RECREATION OF THE AREA. WATERSHIP     
 DOWN, WITH ITS LITERARY CONNECTIONS   
 RECEIVES VISITORS BOTH LOCAL &amp; FROM   
 FURTHER AFIELD. IN PLEASANT WEATHER   
 YOU CAN FIND PEOPLE UP THERE FLYING   
 KITES &amp; RADIO CONTROLLED AEROPLANES,  
 BESIDES RAMBLING &amp; PICNICKING.        
                                       
 AT WHITE HILL ON THE DOWNS, THERE IS A
 VIEWPOINT, WITH ACCOMPANYING CAR PARK 
 &amp; PICNIC AREA. THE PRESENCE OF SEVERAL
 RACING STABLES GIVES RISE TO GALLOPS &amp;
 STEEPLECHASE COURSES ON TOP OF        
 WATERSHIP. LOCAL HUNTS USE THE AREA &amp; 
 ON BOXING DAYS A DRAG HUNT IS HELD    
 OVER THE DOWNS. THERE ARE MANY BRIDLE 
 PATHS &amp; PUBLIC FOOTPATHS, THOUGH MANY 
 OF THE LATTER ARE OVERGROWN. ORGANISED
 PHEASANT SHOOTING IS VERY FREQUENT IN 
 THE SEASON.                           
                                       </content>
