		<content> The Mary Hare Grammar School for the  
 deaf is funded by a Charity Trust and 
 fees paid by each pupil's Local       
 Education Authority.It is a           
 co-educational school and most of the 
 200 pupils aged 11-18 board there for 
 the 4 terms.There are approx.10 pupils
 per class and although these low      
 numbers limit the numbers of public   
 exam classes available,they are       
 necessary for the individual attention
 given by specially trained teachers.  
 The desks are set in a horseshoe shape
 all facing the teachers,complete with 
 sound boxes and microphones;all pupils
 are proficient lip readers.In the case
 of fire there are both fire bells and 
 flashing lights to warn the totally   
 deaf.The school moved to its present  
 site in the 18 century Arlington manor
 house in the 1950's.Its large grounds 
 are both woodland and parkland.       </content>
