		<content> One corner of our area includes some  
 married quarters of the Royal Air     
 Force Station at Benson. Some of these
 houses are within the electoral       
 district of Ewelme though few ever    
 exercise the right to vote in local   
 elections. The unit is the home of the
 Queens Flight which functions to      
 provide air tansport for HM The Queen 
 and other members of the Royal Family 
 going about their business. Sometimes 
 they travel by helicopter and at      
 other times they use propeller driven 
 aircraft called Andovers.
