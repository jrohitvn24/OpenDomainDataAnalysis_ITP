		<title>15Lock Museum _Willenhall</title>
		<content>  The presence of coal, iron and       
 limestone in the Black Country gave   
 rise to the metal trades for which it 
 was famous. By the eighteenth century 
 the towns of Wolverhampton, Willenhall
 and Bilston made most of the countries
 locks. In the nineteenth century      
 Willenhall became an international    
 centre for lockmaking, which it still 
 is today.                             
  The museum in New Road is an example 
 of a typical small lockmaking         
 premises. Apart from a house there is 
 a lockmakers workshop at the rear. The
 museum tries to show the progress of  
 lockmaking from the blacksmith's art  
 to the highly mechanised industry of  
 today. Visitors can participate in    
 making locks by hand, and learn       
 durectly from the local               
 craftsmen,keeping alive local history.
