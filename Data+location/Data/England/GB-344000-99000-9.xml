		<content> No part of the area has escaped       
 mankind's attention.  The northeast l 
 km. square is mainly a built up part  
 of Beaminster.  There are also two    
 villages less densely populated within
 the block.  There are two sizeable    
 areas of woodland, one of 12 hectares 
 of wood/parkland around Parnham and   
 one of 15 hectares in a thin ribbon   
 along the banks of a tributary of the 
 river Brit.  The rest is mainly       
 farming land of small to moderate     
 sized fields, with a tendency to      
 enlargement in recent years.  The     
 northern half is at the end of the    
 Dorset down chalk areas, but it is not
 typical as most of the fields have    
 been ploughed in recent years.  There 
 is one conservation area being        
 developed for the protection of owls. 
 Pollution is low.  The area is fairly 
 well served with footpaths.           </content>
