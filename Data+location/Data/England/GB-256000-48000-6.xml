		<content> near humans,chaffinches who nest near 
 grassland and their cousins the       
 goldfinches who are migrant           
 visitors.Summer visitors are swallows 
 and housemartins,who build their mud  
 nests in the eaves of buildings.We    
 also see blackbirds and thrushes,and  
 at ploughing time the tractors are    
 followed by a variety of gulls.Perhaps
 most beautiful are the soaring        
 buzzards,not a rare bird here,often   
 seen perching on telegraph poles      
 watching for small rodents to eat.Even
 more often seen is another, smaller   
 bird of prey, the kestrel, who nests  
 on nearby cliffs or in high trees or  
 derelict buildings.                   
      Birdwatching is a fascinating    
 hobby which is made more enjoyable in 
 South Devon by the wide variety of    
 species found here.
