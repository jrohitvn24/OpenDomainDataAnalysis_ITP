		<title>07Shawforth Quarries</title>
		<content>    Shawforth quarries produce stone   
 which has been used for buildings and 
 monuments in London. The quarry has   
 been leased for 27 years by the Lord  
 of the Manor to Mrs. Linda Haworth.   
 She has seven employees.              
                                       
   They buy and dress second hand      
 stone, some of which has been bought  
 as building stone by famous people    
 such as Paul McCartney and Norman     
 Wisdom, and footballers Francis Lee   
 and Colin Bell.                       
                                       
   On the other side of the valley are 
 the remains of Shawforth's coal mines 
 which produced coal for the factories 
 in Whitworth and Rossendale. Coal was 
 extracted by digging in to the        
 hill side as opposed to digging mine  
 shafts.
