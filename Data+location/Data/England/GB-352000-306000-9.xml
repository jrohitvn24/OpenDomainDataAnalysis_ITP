		<title>09BERRINGTON C.E. SCHOOL</title>
		<content> There are{2 classrooms,}a general     
 purpose room, a toilet block, a       
 tarmacadam playground, a playing field
 with a Geodome climbing frame and a   
 garden area that was at one time part 
 of the School House garden. The{School
{House}is let to a private tenant.     
 The school has only 26 pupils aged    
 from 4-11 years. There are 2 teachers 
 (Mr. Hotchkiss and Mrs.Trillo). Most  
 of the children live in Cross Houses  
 and come to school in car or cycle.   
 There is{concern}that there are so    
 few young children living in the area 
 and that next year the school may be  
 threatened by the prospect of closure 
 because there will again be less than 
 30 children on roll.
