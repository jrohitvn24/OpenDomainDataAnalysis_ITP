		<content> THE HARWICH TOWN COUNCIL WAS SET UP IN
 1974 TO REPLACE THE OLD BOROUGH       
 COUNCIL. THERE ARE NOW SIXTEEN        
 COUNCILLORS WHO MEET AT THE GUILDHALL 
 EVERY THREE WEEKS.  THE COUNCIL IS    
 SIMILAR TO A PARISH COUNCIL, RUNNING  
 ALLOTMENTS, LOOKING AT TOWN PLANNING  
 APPLICATIONS AND GRANTING MONEY TO    
 DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. TO PAY THIS, 
 THE TENDRING DISTRICT COUNCIL COLLECTS
 RATES FROM EVERY HOUSEHOLDER. THE     
 LOCAL COUNCIL RECEIVES Â£8000 FROM THE 
 RATES.TO HELP LOCAL PEOPLE THEY PAID  
 FOR A HOIST FOR THE NEW SWIMMING POOL.
     THE COUNCIL EMPLOY 2 PEOPLE - A   
 CLERK AND ALSO A CARETAKER TO LOOK    
 AFTER THE GUILDHALL.                  
     THE COUNCIL ALSO TRIES TO KEEP    
 ALIVE OLD TRADITIONS. A NEW MAYOR IS  
 CHOSEN ANNUALLY AND A MAYOR MAKING    
 CEREMONY IS HELD EVERY YEAR, IN MAY,  
 TO START THE MAYOR'S TERM OF OFFICE.  </content>
