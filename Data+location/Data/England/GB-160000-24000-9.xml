		<content>    In Porthleven, there are two       
 Methodist Chapels called Fore Street  
 and Peverell Road, the Parish Church  
 of St Bartholomew, the Christadelphian
 Church and the Apostolic.             
    The Methodist Chapels are the      
 biggest churches in Porthleven. They  
 each have an Anniversary to remember  
 the founding of the Sunday Schools.   
 Both Churches join St.Bartholomews to 
 celebrate Saint Peterstide.           
    St. Bartholomews Church was built  
 in 1842 on land given by Canon John   
 Rogers the squire of the nearby       
 Penrose Estate.                       
    The Apostolic Church is small and  
 so does not join in many of the       
 village activities.                   
    Christadelphian means brother in   
 Christ. This church does not have     
 festivals at Christmas and Easter like
 the other churches.                   </content>
