 The Fairfax C.P.School was founded by 
 Sir Thomas Fairfax over 100 years ago.
 The school consisted of a large room  
 divided by a screen.There was a school
 house for the headteacher.            
 In 1964/5 the West Riding County      
 Council rehabilitated the school at a 
 cost of approximately Â£30 000.An extra
 classroom,hall,kitchen,staffroom and  
 toilet facilities were added.Enough   
 land was bought for a playing field.  
 Today the Infant class has the old    
 classroom.It has had a new floor and  
 ceiling,and the walls are covered with
 cedar boarding.The Juniors have the   
 other classroom.There  are 30 children
 in the school.Some children eat school
 dinners,others have packed meals.There
 is a garden,a greenhouse and 2        
 climbing frames.                      </content>
