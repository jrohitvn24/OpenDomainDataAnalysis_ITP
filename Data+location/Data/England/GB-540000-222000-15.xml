		<title>15THE SUPERNATURAL</title>
		<content>   In this area there are three major  
 sources of psyco-kinetic powers.      
   One of these is [redacted] in    
 [redacted]. It is the oldest       
 building in [redacted] and is also 
 the only [redacted] building in the    
 area.                                 
   The supernatural occurances in this 
 building involve the ghost of a man   
 who committed suicide by hanging      
 himself, after an arguement with a    
 friend.                               
   He is said mainly to haunt the room 
 which he died in but has also been    
 seen in other parts of the building   
 especially the kitchen.               
   Many tennants or lodgers claimed to 
 have seen him and have soon left the  
 building.                             
   He does not restrict his haunting to
  only [redacted] because he has been   
 seen in adjacent houses.              </content>
