		<content>{                                      
{ }The Sele Farm Estate is situated not
 too near the town centre but in the   
 right place to be a good housing      
 estate.  It is set off the main B1000 
 road &amp; has a good bus service.  Many  
 of the houses belong to the council   
 but gradually more &amp; more of them are 
 being bought by their tenants.        
     The estate's shops are always busy
 &amp; are well used by the local people.  
 Quite a large number of houses have   
 their own garages nearby or adjoining 
 the houses.  This shows that quite a  
 lot of people have cars.  Many also   
 walk or use bicycles to get about &amp; to
 keep fit.                             
   Houses in some part of the estate   
 look different from others.  This is  
 because they were built at different  
 times &amp; of different types of brick.
