 Binfield Heath Congregational Chapel  
was built in eighteen thirty five, and 
constructed in a Gothic style. It has a
narrow battlemented watch tower which  
forms part of the entrance and doorway.
 The Chapel was formerly run by the    
Rev.James Sherman.                     
 Binfield Heath has its own baby       
sitting club and annually holds a      
district flower show, which is held    
in late July or early August and has   
run since nineteen forty eight.        
 The village also has its own          
playground which is intended mainly for
younger children and has swings, a     
merry-go-round, a slide, a rocking     
horse and a sand pit. The playground is
run for the parish council by a local  
committee. All the equipment was       
brought with money raised locally
