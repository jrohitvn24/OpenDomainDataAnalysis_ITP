		<title>14Seal Village</title>
		<content>Seal is a village situated on the A25. 
It is mainly a residential area, but it
does have a farm and a few shops.  The 
A25 is a fairly busy road and became   
the subject of argument a few years ago
because of the number of lorries       
passing through Seal. The issue was    
solved with the building of the M26    
which diverts much of the              
long-distance traffic. The shops of    
the village are of an unusual nature.  
There are two expensive restaurants    
and an antique shop, but the ordinary  
grocers shops are continually changing 
hands due to lack of custom. Seal is   
obviously an attraction for the rich   
and eccentric! There are also four pubs
and two petrol stations, one of which  
used to be the village forge.  The     
oldest attraction is the 700 year old  
church set in farmland.  Housing is    
varied, with a few expensive homes.    </content>
