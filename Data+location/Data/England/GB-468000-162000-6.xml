  Beech Hill village is in this        
 area. Here the newer houses are to be 
 found - built in 1950s.               
{ Beech Hill House} is very elegant in 
 design ,it has been turned into flats.
 The other houses are either Victorian 
 in style or Georgian. In other words, 
 with flat faced walls, coloured       
 lightish brown and square windows and 
 huge gardens .                        
  There are some Tudor houses in the   
 area, with wooden beams on the        
 outside, filled in with red bricks.   
 They are very large,and inside        
 are large oak beams. There are some   
 pensioners houses in the area. The    
 oldest building in the area, which is 
 still lived in, was built in the 16th 
 century. But the oldest remains of a  
 building is the old Priory, dating    
 from the 13th century. {              </content>
