		<title>14THE CHURCH</title>
		<content>      In Forest Town there is a church 
 called St. Albans where my little baby
 sister was christened. On Sundays     
 services are held from half past ten  
 to about half past twelve. The vicar's
 name is Rev. Robin Walford who, as    
 well as being the vicar, looks after  
 the graveyard and keeps it neat and   
 tidy.                                 
      There are lots of organisations  
 in the church like Sunday School,     
 mother and toddlers and young wives.  
 Jumble sales and coffee mornings raise
 money for the church.                 
      There are weddings and funerals  
 that take place in the church most of 
 the time. The church services are for 
 the congregation and for anybody else 
 who wants to know about Jesus. A lot  
 of the work in the church is done by  
 the ordinary people who want to help  
 in running their church.{JULIE SUTTON </content>
