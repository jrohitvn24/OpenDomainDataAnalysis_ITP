		<title>13  LIVING IN A PUB</title>
		<content>   My name is Jamie Tarrington I am 11 
 years old. I live in the Saling Oak.  
 the Saturday before last I got up at  
 half past twelve.I got dressed and    
 went downstairs I checked the         
 machines, cleaned the plates, replaced
 the food in the cabinets and helped   
 serve.At the end of the day I emptied 
 the machines and carried the money    
 over to the bar. I get on well with   
 the customers. I am allowed to watch  
 the Banger Racing which takes place   
 every few weeeks in a field directly  
 opposite. When it is finished many of 
 drivers come and have a drink at our  
 pub. I like living in a pub , but I   
 would also like to live on an estate  
 where I could play with my friends.   
 When it gets too busy in the pub I go 
 and watch a video upstairs. I enjoy my
 homelife because of the atmosphere.
