    The pottery is run by Mrs          
 Williamson and Mrs Pawsey. It is      
 housed in two wooden sheds about 40   
 years old and opened 4 years ago.     
    About 50 pots are made each day.   
 They are decorated blue, brown, white 
 and yellow. Some are ovenproof,       
 others range from piggy banks to      
 plates and vases. They use buff clay  
 to make their mugs, pots and plates. A
 mug with your name on it will cost    
 Â£1.75. They use an electric wheel and 
 the kiln heats to 1260c and is on for 
 14 hours.                             
    They give lessons in the craft of  
 pottery and are about to employ an    
 experienced craftsman on a part time  
 basis, now their business is          
 expanding.
