		<content>  For many years Littlemoor was a large
 housing estate with very few          
 amenities,surrounded by countryside   
 and seemingly cut off from the rest of
 Weymouth.                             
  Recently,it has been the site of     
 major developments in both housing and
 services.A large supermarket and      
 shopping area was built which now     
 draws in people from outside          
 Littlemoor.Houses,play areas and a    
 club have been completed.             
  A new Health Centre is nearing       
 completion and shortly a Church is to 
 be constucted nearby.Littlemoor       
 Primary School has been enlarged to   
 cater for the extra children now      
 living in the area.
