		<title>05ECOLOGY: CHELWOOD GATE</title>
		<content> The area is situated in the High      
 Weald, on the South Western slopes of 
 Ashdown Forest and attracts high rain-
 fall due to the prevailing South West 
 winds. At 600 feet winters can be very
 bleak. The flora &amp; fauna are typical  
 of open heathland with some woodland. 
 Large mammals include fallow deer,    
 badger &amp; fox. Numerous small animals  
 are also to be found, with insects,   
 moths and butterflies. Stonechats and 
 tree pipits make use of the low gorse;
 the great spotted woodpecker inhabits 
 the woody areas. The most common rap- 
 tor is the kestrel; yellowhammers,    
 willow warblers and other small birds 
 abound. Many varieties of heather and 
 gorse, bracken and ferns have colo-   
 nized the ground level with predomi-  
 nantly pine and birch above, together 
 with alder and oak, hazel, willow and 
 holly.                                </content>
