{_________________________________     
 In{1285}King Edward I granted the     
 Harcourt family "A weekly market on   
 Wednesday,and a fair on the eve,day   
 and morrow of St. Peter and St.       
 Paul,at their manor of Bosworth."This 
 market still survives and is a very   
 important feature of the area.The     
 market is situated in the cobbled     
 square surrounded by old              
 houses,weaver's cottages and          
 shops.Some of the shops are in the old
 Wheatsheaf Courtyard including "The   
 Bookworm",a travel agents and a wool  
 shop.                                 
 The Wednesday market attracts shoppers
 from the outlying villages who are    
 bussed in.Many shopkeepers are not    
 happy about the market because they   
 think it takes away their trade but   
 the shoppers are very happy with it.  </content>
