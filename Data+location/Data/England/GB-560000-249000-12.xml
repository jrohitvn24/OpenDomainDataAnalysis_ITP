		<content>     This is a rural area with only    
 small villages and isolated farms.The 
 rolling countryside consists of mostly
 large ploughed or cultivated fields,  
 divided by natural hedges or small    
 ditches.The area around West Wickham  
 and the old airfield form a kind of   
 plateau and is a watershed. Several   
 small deciduous woods are dotted      
 across the land.Remains of disused    
 chalkpits can be found in some fields.
     Eye-catching buildings are West   
 Wratting Windmill, a restored smock-  
 mill standing on West Wratting hill,  
 West Wratting Hall and the recently   
 rebuilt cattle pound, listed as an    
 ancient monument.West Wickham church, 
 with its beautiful blue clockface tow-
 ers high above the village.Worth ment-
 ioning are the newly restored aircraft
 hangers on the old airfield, they are 
 used by the E.E.C. to store grain.    </content>
