		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO AREA</title>
		<content> This area is almost entirely rural.   
 There are four small villages (all    
 with churches) and a total approximate
 population of 5OO. The overall        
 impression is of quiet communities of 
 people who get on with their own lives
 preferring to involve themselves in   
 local life on a very selective basis. 
 Families with children are obviously  
 involved more with each other but     
 there are many older couples whose    
 children have moved away who are      
 passing their retirement years in     
 these villages.  There are village    
 fetes - this year a{Village Open Day  
 in Flyford  - Barbecues etc. but these
 occur in summer.  During the winter   
 months there is little activity save  
 at Christmas.  The farming is mainly  
 cattle, milk and summer wheat;        
 production is often dictated by EEC   
 and Government grants.                </content>
