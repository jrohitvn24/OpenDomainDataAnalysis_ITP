 The school provides a midday meal at  
 the cost of 63 pence a day.Parents may
 choose to let their children have this
 or provide sandwiches.In general the  
 children who have a school meal have a
 sandwich meal in the evening the      
 others have a cooked meal.Most of the 
 children eat as part of their         
 family.Not many children eat          
 separately from their parents.The     
 majority eat in the kitchen,followed  
 very closely by the number who watch  
 the television in the sitting room    
 while eating their meal.The number of 
 children that  eat in the dining room 
 and sitting room is low.The kitchen is
 becoming an important room in the     
 house.No longer is it used for food   
 preparation alone but it doubles as a 
 family room,many incorporate purpose  
 built dining bays.                    </content>
