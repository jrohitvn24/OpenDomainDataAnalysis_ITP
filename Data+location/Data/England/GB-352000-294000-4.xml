		<title>04HALL FARM, LUTWYCHE, SHROPS.</title>
		<content>   This is an owner/occupier farm and  
 what is termed a family farm,using no 
 outside labour on a regular basis,    
 being self-run by a father and 2 sons 
 aged 21 and 22. It is mainly a dairy  
 farm. The sons maintain and keep the  
 machinery in working order; welding,  
 bricklaying, fencing etc. all being   
 done by themselves. The Young Farmers 
 Club offers a wide scope of interests 
 and pursuits for young people in these
 rural areas, and one son made a cup-  
 winning trailor this year. Grain is   
 grown but for use only in feeding on  
 the farm - none being sold. Silage is 
 harvested along with a little hay.    
 Being a family enterprise,hardly a    
 mealtime goes by without farm matters 
 being raised - a way of life indeed,  
 and full of interest.
