		<title>10Interview With Mr.Wilks</title>
		<content> Mr Wilks is 76 years old. He has lived
 in Tiptree all his life and enjoys it.
 Mr Wilks seems to have a high opinion 
 of Tiptree. He says that he preferred 
 1985 to 1920, because there are more  
 people and he is not as lonely. At the
 beginning of his life he was one of   
 300  people living in Tiptree . There 
 were thirteen pubs. Now there are only
 six Pubs and around 10,000 people.    
 Mr Wilks thinks that Tiptree          
 is no more peaceful than it was in    
 1930. He said that his ancestors lived
 in Tiptree during the 16th century and
 have lived there ever since. Mr Wilks 
 thinks that the police force should   
 become better because there is more   
 technology. He also thinks that living
 in Tiptree in 1985 would be better if 
 the council would run things more     
 smoothly.
