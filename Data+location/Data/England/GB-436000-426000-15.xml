		<content> The Rothwell Juniors play at          
 Woodlesford park,they have teams from 
 7 to 16 years old.Dominic played for  
 the Rothwell Juniors when he was under
 10.When they needed a new goalkeeper  
 in 1983 I began playing for them. We  
 go training every Wednesday, we start 
 at 6-0-clock. Normally we start by    
 jogging around the football field,    
 then we do some press-ups.After that  
 we play football.                     
 This year Rothwell Juniors under 11's 
 have had a successful season,we have  
 come runners up in the league and the 
 Charles Rice cup.This seasons strip is
 red with two white stripes down each  
 side and a black stripe down the      
 middle of the white stripe. .
