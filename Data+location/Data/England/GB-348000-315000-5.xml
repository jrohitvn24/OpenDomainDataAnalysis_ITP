 studying is called Harlescott and is  
 found on the northern side of the     
 town.                                 
    The area is mostly agricultural in 
 nature consisting of arable and small 
 dairy farms, there is some areas of   
 woodland but these are small and      
 obviously remnants of much larger     
 areas of woodland.                    
    Part of our area is made up of     
 built up area most the housing estates
 of Harlescott including Mount
