		<content> The Parents Association was started by
 Mr Griffiths in October 1973 when some
 parents asked if a Parents Association
 could be formed.Every parent who has a
 child at the school is automatically a
 member of it.The chairman in 1985 is  
 Mrs Redfern.The money raised at       
 different functions is spent on the   
 pupils and their needs.The most recent
 things to be bought were some floppy  
 discs for the computer.In 1984 Â£1,500 
 was raised and it is hoped that amount
 will be raised in 1985.There are at   
 least six meetings in a year.The      
 preident is Mr Griffiths,the          
 headmaster.The object of the Parent   
 Assocation is to advance the education
 of the pupils  in the school,by       
 providing facilities for education.   
 Some things the assocation have       
 provided are 2 computers,television,  
 sports kit,maths and visual aids.     </content>
