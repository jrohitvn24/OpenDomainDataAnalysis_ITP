		<title>05A Martinstown Family</title>
		<content>   Mary Bowering was born in 1922, the 
 eleventh child of a Martinstown       
 family. Both her grandfather and her  
 cousin were custodians of Maiden      
 Castle, the ancient hillfort          
 dominating the landscape, and her     
 father was a hedger and ditcher, an   
 occupation now sadly disappeared.     
  Her childhood was different to that  
 described by grandaughter Lucy. Life  
 was harder, quieter,Mary's mother used
 to take in washing from the bigger    
 houses and sometimes cooked too.      
   Pastimes centred around the village.
 Children begged rides from farm carts 
 (then the main traffic), collected the
 registration numbers of the still     
 uncommon cars that occasionally drove 
 by or played guessing games.          
   A charabanc trip to Portland was    
 special. Mary's mother was sure it    
 would crash driving down Fortuneswell.</content>
