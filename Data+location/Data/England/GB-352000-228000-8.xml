		<title>08TRESECH  FARM</title>
		<content> Mrs. Roberts of Tresech Farm Keeps    
 sheep and cattle at the moment. She   
 puts 180 acres aside for the animals. 
 She has 330 sheep and 160 cattle. She 
 isn't really interested in modern     
 machinery and just has the basics on  
 her farm apart from an expensive JCB, 
 and she wasn't sure if it was worth   
 the money. Computers are now very     
 popular in farming but Mrs. Roberts   
 thinks it could only help her a       
 little. Altogether Mrs. Roberts has   
 280 acres of farmland but only 100    
 acres is used for crops. Apart from   
 keeping crops and animals, Mrs.       
 Roberts grows and sells Christmas     
 trees. Only 1 acre is used for this   
 and it is a very hard job because it  
 is difficult to keep the weeds at bay.
 She keeps 6000 Christmas trees and has
 been growing them for 5 years.
