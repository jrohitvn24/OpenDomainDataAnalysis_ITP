		<title>10ST. HELENS CHURCH</title>
		<content>    St. Helens Church was origionally  
 built by the{Saxons in 812,}then was  
 rebuilt by the{Normans in 1087.}We can
 tell this as a Crib was found with    
 Coffins in it but unfortunately it was
 filled in with cement because of      
 subsidence.                           
 The outside Tower was built in 1789   
 but the inside was built in 1329. The 
{font}inside the Church is made of     
{solid oak}and there are only two of   
 that kind in the world. One is in     
 London and the other is St, Helens    
 Church. Everything in the Church is   
 made of solid oak except for the      
 Church doors which are made of elm.   
 There are quite a few stained glass   
 windows but they are all modern ones  
 as the old ones were ruined. Most of  
 the history records of Thurnscoe were 
 ruined in the{Fire of York}and the    
 Cathedral in{1843.                    </content>
