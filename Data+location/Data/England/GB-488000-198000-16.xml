		<title>16Lt.Kingshill Baptist Church</title>
		<content>   In 1814,February 17th,the church was
 formed.It consisted of the chapel,a   
 cottage,out buildings,a stable,the    
 burial ground and a garden. Fourteen  
 years later Mr.Thomas Jordan,the      
 pastor,died.Six years later the chapel
 was pulled down and was rebuilt.It was
 much larger than before,altogether it 
 cost Â£140 to be rebuilt.              
   In 1840 two new galleries were      
 built.Fifteen years later some new    
 trustees were appointed.Until 53 years
 ago the church was lit by oil lamps,  
 but in 1932 electric lights were      
 installed.                            
   In 1933 the people who ran it       
 started a childrens weekday service.  
   Today the hall,which is joined to   
 the church,is being extended to make  
 it bigger because the church community
 is growing and so more space is       
 required for church activities.       </content>
