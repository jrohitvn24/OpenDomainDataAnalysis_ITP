		<title>04Paul's Manifesto For Newark</title>

   These are the things I would like to
 improve in Newark. I would improve the
 toilets especially on Sconce Hills,   
 they are never open. The reason they  
 get closed is because people spray    
 paint inside.                         
   Break dancing should have a spot in 
 Newark with mats and everything       
 instead of on the street. It would be 
 good to have a hall to break dance in,
 because the clubs could get together  
 and practice. There could be a        
 swimming pool next door, so that      
 everyone could have a swim after      
 dancing. If the young people had these
 things to do they would not have time 
 to waste writing on toilet walls.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
