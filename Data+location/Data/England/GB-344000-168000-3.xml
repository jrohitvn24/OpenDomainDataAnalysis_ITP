 in 1968.  There were until July 1984  
 two separate buildings, the main      
 building in Whiteoak Way and the      
 Annexe in Church Lane by Holy Trinity 
 Church. Since September 1984 the whole
 School has been together on the main  
 site.                                 
 Today, in 1985, there are 378 children
 in the School in 12 classes. The      
 Teaching Staff consists of the        
 Headteacher and 12.3 Teachers( that   
 means 12 fulltime Teachers each with a
 class of their own and a part-time    
 Teacher who works three mornings a    
 week.) The Caretaker has three        
 Cleaners to help him look after the   
 buildings. There are 5 people working 
 in the School's Kitchen and 5 "Dinner 
 Ladies" to help look after the        
 children at lunch-time.
