		<title>04Houses in Parkfield area</title>
		<content>Many houses in the Parkfield area      
are old.   You can tell how old they   
are by looking at their bricks.   One  
house has a date on it, 1938.   Nearly 
all the houses around the Parkfield    
area are council houses.   People who  
cannot afford to buy their own rent    
them. There is a block of flats in the 
area built in the 1950s.   Some people 
live in terraced houses others in semi-
detached.   The council houses are     
semi-detached too.   Most of the       
council houses were built in the 1930s 
and the terraced houses are even older.
Some of the terraced houses date from  
last century and are not all occupied. 
The oldest house in Parkfield is on the
Birmingham New Rd., near to our school.
It used to be four miners'homes which  
were terraced &amp; had four chimneys. Two 
local houses had to be rebuilt after   
bombing in the Second World war.       </content>
