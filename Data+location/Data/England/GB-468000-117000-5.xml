		<title>05RECREATION ON BUTSER HILL</title>
		<content> This is an ideal place for kite flying
 because of the open spaces, hills and 
 upcurrents of air.Radio controlled    
 model aircraft and gliders are flown. 
 Hang gliders take off from the summit 
 of the escarpment and can be seen     
 floating over the area.Pony trekking  
 expeditions are arranged each weekend 
 and on summer evenings, taking in     
 visits to local inns.Grass ski_ing,now
 an internatioal sport is becoming very
 popular.For the experienced, the ski  
 club has a lift to the higher slopes. 
 Grass skis look very different from   
 the long snow skis and are like large 
 boots set on caterpillar wheels. High 
 speeds can be reached on them.In the  
 winter months, if snow has fallen, the
 conventional skiers and tobogganers   
 appear on the slopes.Many visitors    
 while away their leisure time watching
 others pursuing these pastimes.       </content>
