     Corsica Hall is now the Seaford   
 College of The training of Domestic   
 Science Teachers.It stands where a    
 cannon once defied would be enemies   
 and where a mill peacefully ground its
 flour.It originally stood at Ringmer, 
 near Lewes and it was built there by a
 notorious smuggler called Whitfield   
 who smuggled wine from Corsica,but he 
 presented it to George II "with some  
 of his samples."This earned him a     
 pardon,so he built a house and named  
 it Corsica Hall.It was then bought by 
 Lord Napier.Finally it was purchased  
 by Mr.Harben,a clockmaker from Lewes  
     It then became{Seaford College}but
 during the 2nd World War they were    
 evacuated to Petworth.After the war   
 it became the{Training College of     
{Domestic Science Teachers.}           </content>
