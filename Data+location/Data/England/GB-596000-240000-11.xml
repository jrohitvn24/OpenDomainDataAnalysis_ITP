		<title>11THE OLD FORGE, BOXFORD Cont.</title>
		<content>                                       
The Old Forge, which is now a private  
residence, has eight room, the hall,   
the parlour, the forge room, the       
kitchen, a bathroom and three bedrooms.
There used to be two forges in the     
Blackith's room, but when Miss Johnson 
and Miss Osborne moved in one forge was
derelict so they took it away.  The    
beams in the house are very strong and 
very big.  The beams could have floated
down the river.  Miss Johnson and      
Miss Osborne have lived there for 15   
years now.  In the hall there is a very
old linen press.  The forge room just  
had an earth floor, two wooden doors   
and a little window.  There was an old 
stone sink in the hall as it used to be
the old laundry room but when Miss     
Johnson and Miss Osborne moved in they 
moved it out into the garden.
