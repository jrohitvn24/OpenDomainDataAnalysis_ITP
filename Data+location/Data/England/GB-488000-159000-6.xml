		<content> and plants, and the park is noted for 
 its natural history; foxes and badgers
 are common, there are many bats and   
 sparrow hawks and nightjars that      
 occasionally nest in the park.        
 Most of the houses on the site are the
 property of the Theosophical Society, 
 though a few are privately owned. Most
 were built in the 19th Century, and   
 are built in the same style as the old
 castle.                               
 When the motorway was built across the
 old park, the large lake in the park  
 had to be drained. This played havoc  
 with the water table and many houses  
 in the area suffer now from           
 subsidence.                           
 Gossip has it that the estate was     
 bought by John Tekel after it had been
 lost at a game of cards attended by   
 the future George 1V.Part was then    
 sold to primeminister Pitt for RMCS.  </content>
