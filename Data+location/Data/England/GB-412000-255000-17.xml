		<content> We sent out 40 questionnaires to the  
 houses in the village.As we wanted    
 people to fill them in we did not put 
 any names on them so we did not know  
 who returned them. This was a mistake 
 because we only had 20 returned.We    
 hoped to find out if there was much   
 unemployment in the area so we asked  
 for the numbers of adults over 16,how 
 many worked,were retired,unemployed.  
 These were the results:               
    Adults:    *  45  *                
    In Work:   *  29  *                
    Retired:   *  07  *                
    Unemployed *  03  *                
    At School  *  01  *                
 One return stated that there was 1    
 housewife so we think that the        
 'missing' 5 adults may well be other  
 housewives.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
