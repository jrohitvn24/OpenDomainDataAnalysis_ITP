		<content>Following the Second World War         
immigrants were attracted to this      
country in increasing numbers by the   
availability of employment.The 1981    
census in Graisley Ward,Wolverhampton  
recorded 13111 inhabitants,of which    
2697 were born in the Commonwealth     
countries,1950 from India,438 from the 
Caribean,197 from Africa and 744 from  
Pakistan.                              
Most have married and had families.The 
number of children whose father came   
from these countries was 5144,nearly   
40% of all children.In Bingley Junior  
School 245 out of 292 had such parents 
and in Bingley Infants School the      
number was 172 out of 189              
These people have brought their own    
religions,so,in addition to the        
established churches,there now exists 2
Hindu Temples,1 Sikh Temple and 1      
Buddhist Temple in this area.          </content>
