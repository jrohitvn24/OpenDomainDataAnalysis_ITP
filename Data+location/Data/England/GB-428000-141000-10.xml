		<title>10A DAY IN MY LIFE.</title>
		<content> This account is by Christian Mabey who
 lives at Newlands Prospect Farm,      
 Monxton.                              
 I get up about 7:30. Then I get washed
 and dressed and go down for breakfast 
 I usually have "Smacks" (a cereal) for
 breakfast and a cup of coffee. After  
 breakfast I go out to help my dad load
 the tractor on to the lorry. The lorry
 is a Bedford "TK", the tractor is an  
 old Field Marshall. My dad drives the 
 tractor up the ramps and on to the    
 lorry. When the tractor is on the     
 lorry we rope it on, we put the ramps 
 under the tractor and tie them on.    
 Then we pull the caravan around and   
 hitch it on the back of the lorry.    
 Then my mum and dad and myself get    
 into the lorry and set off for        
 Bedford. It is a long ride to Bedford 
 and boring too. When we arrive it is  
 1:30 p.m. Well my mum helps my dad    </content>
