		<title>11HOBBIES AND CLUBS</title>
		<content> The Infant girls prefer drawing and   
 reading while the Junior girls like   
 collecting things and reading. The    
 Infant boys like cycling and swimming 
 and Junior boys enjoy football and    
 sport. Secondary boys also put        
 football first with computers a good  
 second. Secondary girls prefer pop    
 music, dancing and reading. Ladies    
 main hobbies are knitting, sewing and 
 reading while the men have sport as   
 their main hobby.                     
 Few infants attend clubs of any kind  
 but many of the Junior children belong
 to Cubs and Brownies. Secondary       
 children belong to Guides and Scouts  
 and many go to the Youth Club. There  
 seems to be no pattern of club        
 membership for men. Most don't belong 
 to anything but a few go to very      
 specialized clubs. Many of the women  
 belong to women's organisations.      </content>
