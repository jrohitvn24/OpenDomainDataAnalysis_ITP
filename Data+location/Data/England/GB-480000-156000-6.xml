		<content> The north_western corner of the D_    
 block,{Yateley Heath Wood,}is occupied
 by the Forestry Commission. The       
 Commission has leased the land from   
 the Calthorpe estate since 1923. The  
 forests are mostly conifers, but there
 has been more emphasis on non_        
 coniferous "amenity" planting since   
 1970. There are no public rights of   
 way through the Commission's woods.   
      The forest centre at 809586 also 
 administers neighbouring woods at     
 Railroad Heath, Warren Heath,         
 Bramshill, and Crowthorne. It under_  
 _takes general vehicle maintenance    
 for other forest centres in south_    
 eastern England. Another              
 responsibility is local motorway      
 planting. Some 23 full_time forestry  
 staff are employed.
