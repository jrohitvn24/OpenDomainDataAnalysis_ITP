		<title>20PUDSEY PARK</title>
		<content>    Pudsey Park was opened at the end  
 of the 19th century.In those days     
 there was a lake and a bandstand and  
 on Sunday evenings thousands of       
 local people and visitors would gather
 there.Today it does not attract       
 thousands but it is still a popular   
 spot.The bowling greens are used      
 almost all the year round by young and
 old alike.There are beautiful trees,  
 flower-beds,greenhouses,an aviary and 
 a miniature zoo is being built at the 
 present time.                         
    One of the most popular spots is   
 the children's playground,opened in   
 1937 to commemorate the coronation of 
 George VI.There are swings,slides,a   
 climbing frame,a see-saw and a genuine
 steam-roller.The park is at its most  
 beautiful in springtime when the      
 flowering cherry trees lining all     
 the paths are in full bloom.          </content>
