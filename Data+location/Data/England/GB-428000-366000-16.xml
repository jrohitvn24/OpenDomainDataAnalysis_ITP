		<title>16Local History of Beeley Moor</title>
		<content> The area has not seen many changes    
 since it was surveyed for the         
 publication of the first edition of   
 the one-inch Ordnance survey map of   
 England and Wales in 1840.            
 One of the earliest references to     
 Beeley was made in 1086 when the name 
 was said to mean Bega's clearing and  
 it still remains an area devoid of    
 much habitation  and in its natural   
 state.                                
 In the north west corner of the area, 
 there is evidence of an old field     
 system. In 1832, the Beeley Enclosure 
 Award came into being, the prime      
 objective aimed at bringing about     
 agricultural improvements.            
 The Duke of Devonshire was allocated a
 substantial acreage and further       
 additions have been made over the     
 years. It is now designated Chatsworth
 Estate land.                          </content>
