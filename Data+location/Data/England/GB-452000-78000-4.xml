 old machines and strips them down,    
 salvages the good parts,re-furbishes  
 and re-conditions them.They usually   
 have a stock of 20-30 machines.His    
 firm manufacture spares when they are 
 not quickly available.At the moment he
 is working on a "A4" model 1250       
 "multilith" press.                    
 He has been an engineer for 22 years  
 and has worked as a motor             
 mechanic,radio and T.V.engineer,radio 
 officer in the merchant navy,a radar  
 engineer and a print technician.      
  The biggest changes since he has been
 working are computerisation,          
 miniaturisation and increased         
 productivity and reliability.         
  He works from Mondays to Saturdays
