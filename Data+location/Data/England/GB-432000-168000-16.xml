		<title>16The Canal in Hungerford.</title>
		<content>   One  of the delights of Hungerford  
 is a walk along the canal on a        
 Summer's evening.                     
  To moor a boat at Hungerford         
 costs Â£100 per year compared with Â£200
 at Newbury, this is because the entire
 length of the canal, the Kennet and   
 Avon, is not navigable. Indeed at     
 Hungerford only one boat per  month   
 can be seen on the canal. There are   
 plans for the canal to be entirely    
 navigable from Reading to Bristol by  
 1989 .They had a narrow boat known as 
 "The Rose Of Hungerford" specially    
 built in 1983 and  she runs from      
 Hungerford wharf to Dunmill lock      
 throughout the summer offering trips  
 to members of the public .            
  There are 4 locks on the Hungerford  
 stretch. These are approximately 5    
 metres deep.
