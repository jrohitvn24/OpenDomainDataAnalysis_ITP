		<content>    Langwathby is  built  round a large
 village  green. Edenhall is  a  linear
 village.Sandstone is the natural stone
 of the area. Some of the older  houses
 have been protected from rain penetra-
 tion by  pebble dash. The newer houses
 fit in very  well if  they  are  built
 with  sandstone or manufactured  stone
 and  pebble dash. Very few  new houses
 have the stone roof slates or Westmor-
 land  slates. Concrete tiles  are used
 now.The brown ones match the sandstone
 Some  renovated  houses  have concrete
 lintels  and sills but most  buildings
 avoid this. The older  council  houses
 are built with  brown bricks  and have
 stone quoins. The newer council houses
 are  pebble dash  with stone  porches.
 The  school, which  is  in  the  more 
 recently developed area ,is built with
 yellow  bricks.The new  development is
 keeping the character of the  village.</content>
