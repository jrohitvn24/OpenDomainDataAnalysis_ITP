		<title>15WAR PLANES &amp; ARMY EXERCISES.</title>
		<content>    In common with many other South    
 Shropshire areas we are regularly     
 assaulted by the sudden, thunderous   
 din of fast military aircraft         
 practicing precision low level        
 flying.                               
    Titterstone Clee hill, four miles  
 away has a Civil Aviation Authority   
 establishment and radar "mushrooms" on
 top. Brown Clee hill has several      
 communications masts. It is common for
 small fleets of planes to run at      
 these hills and manoeuvre low around  
 the sky. U.S.A.F. A 10 fighters and   
 R.A.F. Buccaneers, Phantoms and       
 Tornadoes often appear.               
     Occasionally Territorial Army     
 exercises are held here too. It has   
 been disconcerting to drive along and 
 suddenly come face to face with prone 
 soldiers manning heavy machine guns,  
 the barrels pointing at one.         {</content>
