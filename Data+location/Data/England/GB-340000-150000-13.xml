		<title>13Wildlife at Weare School</title>
		<content> When Weare School was first built the 
 field was full of rushes. There were a
 few trees but very little else        
 growing.We decided that we ought to   
 have more trees and so parts of the   
 field were dug and saplings were      
 planted.We now have fully grown       
 willows,poplars, birch, alder and ash 
 trees. Then we decided to have a      
 special area for nature. We planted   
 some long grass for the insects and   
 made a rockery for the snails and     
 other creatures. We made a pond and   
 put in lilies, water beetles, water   
 snails and tadpoles. We tried to      
 attract butterflies by planting shrubs
 that caterpillars could feed on. We   
 have supplied bird feeders and nesting
 boxes for all sorts of birds even the 
 tawny owl. The bees are buzzing now on
 the bushes and our school field is    
 full of life.                         </content>
