		<content>{Arts and Crafts}                      
     There appears to be a number of   
arts and crafts - knitting, painting,  
sewing, printing, signwriting,         
woodwork, beaten copperwork, tapestry. 
Some people do arts and crafts purely  
as a hobby, others have become         
semi-professional after selling their  
products to local shops.               
                                       
{Houses in Wetton}                     
     In Wetton, houses are made of     
limestone.  Most of the houses are big 
and old.  They are roofed with both    
slate and tiles.  Wetton houses have   
big gardens.                           
                                       
{Religions}                            
     The place of worship in Wetton is 
the church of England.  The old        
Methodist Chapel has been converted    
into a bed and breakfast Guest House.  </content>
