		<content> The Sun Inn was built about the 16th  
 or 17th century.When Mr.Mc.Guffie     
 owned the Sun Inn in 1921,it used to a
 pig, cow and hen farm. Now Mr.        
 Guarricino, who is Italian, has been  
 the landlord for nearly 14 years.     
 Before the bridge was built, there was
 a wath over Halls beck. All the near_ 
 by houses had steps going down to the 
 beck. On the Village Green there used 
 to be a Moot Hall. Hill Farm has a    
 spinning gallery up stairs.           
 Ashness Cottage was the first post    
 office in the village. Clare's house  
 used to be a joiner's. The house down 
 the road was a tailor's. In 1985,     
 there are fifteen Council houses,but  
 some have been bought by occupiers. No
 new buildings are allowed without     
 planning permission. Many older houses
 are being bought for holiday homes.
