		<title>07CASE STUDY OF A SMALL FARM</title>
		<content>   Little Broadstone Farm is a 40 acre 
 farm on the Weald growing grass for   
 hay and silage, grazing bought in     
 steers in Summer and keeping sheep in 
 Winter, and operating an intensive pig
 unit.                                 
   The pig unit is the main enterprise 
 consisting of 90 breeding sows and 5  
 boars, producing 1900 pork pigs per   
 year.  All replacement breeding stock 
 is home bred, using AI for genetic    
 improvement.  Piglets are weaned at 3 
 weeks and transferred to fattening    
 pens where they are fed dry meal      
 consisting of ground barley and       
 protein concentrate.  They are ready  
 for slaughter at 63 kgs. live weight  
 at 118 days old.                      
   Silage is fed to the cattle in      
 winter and most of the hay is         
 sold. Husband and wife work the farm, 
 with one full time employee.          </content>
