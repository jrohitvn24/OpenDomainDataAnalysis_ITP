		<title>17Hayle Towans.</title>
		<content> The Towans are{grassy sand}dunes.They 
 were formed when we had a huge storm  
 in the 1800s and from them you can see
 most of Hayle.On the way to the Towans
 we passed a river which is polluted by
 metal and factory waste.The stones    
 which built the bridge are made of    
 copper slag. The land by the bridge is
 marshy.When we went through the       
 graveyard there were lots of childrens
 graves.The ground by the graveyard is 
 stony and dusty but on the Towans the 
 ground is very soft.I could see the   
 recreation ground,J &amp; F Pool's (a     
 factory),the Rugby Club,a lot of      
 fields and the industrial estate.Some 
 people say that there is a village    
 buried under part of the Towans. There
 are{holiday camps}and caravan parks   
 there.
