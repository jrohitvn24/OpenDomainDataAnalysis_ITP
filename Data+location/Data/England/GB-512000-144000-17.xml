		<title>17COLDHARBOUR VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Even with new building and            
 re-building, Coldharbour village has  
 remained as picturesque as it was so  
 many years ago.  The name             
 "Coldharbour" means "rough shelter for
 travellers" and the village clings to 
 steep Leith Hill.                     
                                       
 The ll acre site of Anstiebury Camp,  
 dating from l800 B.C. provided shelter
 for the women, children and cattle of 
 the Ancient Britons when absent       
 fighting.  Today Anstiebury Farm      
 produces cream and free-range eggs    
 sold in the single village shop.      
 Upper Merriden Farm has no tap water  
 or electricity even now.  Squires Farm
 breeds sheep and polo ponies, whereas 
 Crockers Farm trains racehorses.
