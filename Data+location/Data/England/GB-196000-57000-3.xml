		<title>03THE CHINA CLAY INDUSTRY PT2</title>
		<content> The process of removing the China Clay
 from the ground is one of open-cast   
 mining.Deposits of kaolin are usually 
 funnel- shaped with the widest part   
 near the surface.Within the area the  
 Clay Pits of{Dorothy and Littlejohns  
 are two open-cast mining operations   
 that are being combined to form the   
 largest working in the St. Austell    
 region.                               
 Together, they cover 325 acres and the
 combined output each week is approx.  
 14,000 tonnes of clay.(10,000 tonnes  
 from Littlejohns and 4,000 tonnes from
 Dorothy).                             
 According to the China Clay Company   
 working the area, this reserve is most
 important and has the highest quality 
 clay used in the Paper Industry as a  
 filler and coating grade.Other        
 applications include the Paint,Rubber,
 Plastics and Pharmaceutical Industries</content>
