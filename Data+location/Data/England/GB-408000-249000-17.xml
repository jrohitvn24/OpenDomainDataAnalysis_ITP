		<title>17A Day in the life of Matthew</title>
		<content> A typical Sunday for me would be to   
 wake at 8.00 am and go down for a     
 breakfast of Sugar Puffs. After       
 breakfast I dress in casual clothes   
 and help my mother to clear away the  
 breakfast things. Then my younger     
 brother and I go out for a bicycle    
 ride while my father works in the     
 garden. On returning from our ride my 
 younger brother has a friend round to 
 play and I help Daddy garden until    
 lunch is ready. A typical Sunday lunch
 for our family includes roast lamb,   
 roast potatoes, peas, carrots,        
 cabbage, gravy and mint sauce. For    
 dessert we have apple pie and custard.
 After lunch my brother and I play with
 construction Lego until bath time.    
 Following our bath we have tea and    
 then get ready for bed. We watch      
 television for a while and I read     
 before going to bed.                  </content>
