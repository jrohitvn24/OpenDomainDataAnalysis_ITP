 aged 3-5years. They have a home corner

 this a favourite with the boys. There 
 are tables with stickle bricks,play-  
 dough,puzzles,dolls house,cars &amp;      
 garage.Also a farmyard with animals.  
 One of their favourites is the sandpit
 At 11am everything is cleared away for
 milk &amp; biscuits. This is also when we 
 tell stories,sing songs, sometimes    
 dancing to records. They also look    
 forward to their yearly trip to the   
 zoo.We take them to a restaurant for  
 Christmas lunch with Father Christmas 
 who gives them presents. We are a very
 happy Playgroup and hope to continue  
 to be so. This Playgroup is run by    
 volunteers  mostly mothers.
