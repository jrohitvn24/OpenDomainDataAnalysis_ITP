		<content> The streets have many different styles
 of buildings.                         
 There are many interesting patterns of
 tile work on the Victorian houses.Tall
 chimneys which are heavily decorated  
 at the top.Manyof these older houses  
 have now been turned into flats and   
 apartments,especially used in the     
 holiday season.                       
 Many of the streets are tree lined,the
 horse_chestnut and sycamore are two   
 popular types.                        
 Many of the modern houses on the      
 sea front have been built with low    
 flat roofs so they can stand up to the
 sands and strong winds which very     
 often blow.                           
 The sand is checked regularly to stop 
 it getting onto the roads and         
 buildings along the streets bordering 
 the coast.
