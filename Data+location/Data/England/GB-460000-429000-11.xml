		<title>11MY GRANDAD AND GRANDMA</title>
		<content> My Grandad was born in{Poland.}He grew
 up to be in the army. It was the time 
 that{Germany}was fighting Poland. He  
 met my Grandma in a{concentration     
{camp.}The{Polish}uniform was a{German 
 uniform with a white and red armband. 
 (Thats the colour of the Polish flag.)
 A line of men, women and even children
 stood outside the concentration camp  
{waiting}to be{killed.}My Grandad and  
 Grandma were lucky because a man next 
 to my Grandad got killed. On that     
 night my Grandad and Grandma escaped. 
 They went past an{electric fence}and  
 the Germans nearly found them. They   
 escaped to{Italy}and got married.     
 Their first son died. And they  moved 
 to Wales, and had my mum. They moved  
 again, had my Auntie Krysia and so on.
 Then they came to England, lived in a 
 house in Denison Road.
