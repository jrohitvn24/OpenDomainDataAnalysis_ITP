		<title>16Robert Winters. Part Four.</title>
		<content>  Robert is given seventy pence a week 
 pocket money. He puts forty pence in  
 the bank to save towards school trips 
 and spends thirty pence at Morrisons. 
 Morrisons is a big supermarket near   
 Heapham that Robert's family call     
 their local shop. They do most of     
 their weekly shopping there.          
  Robert enjoys living in a village but
 sometimes he gets rather bored because
 he lives such a long way from any     
 friends. His mother told us that if   
 they want to go to the cinema they    
 have to travel to Lincoln. This takes 
 a long time by bus and is expensive. A
 few weeks ago they went to see        
 Ghostbusters. They caught the bus at  
 five minutes past one and did not     
 return home until half past six. The  
 trip for two children, one adult and  
 two ice-creams cost ten pounds and    
 twenty pence.                         </content>
