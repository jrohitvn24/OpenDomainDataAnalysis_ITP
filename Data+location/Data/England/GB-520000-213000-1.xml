		<title>01HISTORY-WELWYN GARDEN CITY</title>
		<content> Welwyn Garden City was the idea of    
 Ebenezer Howard. He wanted to improve 
 living standards for the not so rich  
 and the new town was designed to make 
 the best use possible of landscaping. 
 The architect was a man called Louis  
 de Soissons, and preparation began in 
 1919 although the town's birthdate is 
 actually 1920.  Ebenezer Howard was   
 born in the City of London on the 29th
 of January, 1850, he was one of four  
 surviving children out of nine.  In   
 1865 he moved to America to try and   
 make something of his life.  Ebenezer 
 returned to England in 1876, and it   
 was his second wife who gave him all  
 the drive and moral support to carry  
 on his work with new towns.  The town 
 was planned so that the industrial    
 area was set apart, and some of the   
 first houses can still be seen around 
 the Handside Lane area.               </content>
