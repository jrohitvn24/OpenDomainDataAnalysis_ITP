		<content> The vicar of the parish which includes
{St Denys' church}has been curate for  
 27 years. He had previously spent 16  
 years teaching at{Bradfield College,}a
 local public school. Before actually  
 training to be a priest he was in the 
 army and volunteered for service at   
 the outbreak of the second world war, 
 during which time he achieved the rank
 of{Captain.}The church at Stanford    
 Dingley, which is ministered by the   
{Bishop of Reading,}has two services a 
 week. On sundays they are at 8.00 a.m 
 and 11.00 a.m. The congregation       
 numbers from between 25 to 35. The    
 organ is played by a local            
 parishioner. While the priest has seen
 little change in Stanford Dingley he  
 has noticed a marked change in 60     
 years in the reduction of local shops 
 and buses ( which used to run every   
 hour from 6.00 a.m to 11.00 a.m.      </content>
