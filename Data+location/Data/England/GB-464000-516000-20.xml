		<title>20CAMPING WITH THE SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> About 20 children from the Junior     
 School go to camp for the weekend. The
 site is at a farm about 2 miles out of
 Skelton. There are a number of tents  
 that sleep three or four children     
 each. Cooking is on a wood fire which 
 keeps the children busy foraging for  
 wood. Other chores include fetching   
 water, digging waste holes, and       
 helping with the preparation of food. 
 The children may play in the extensive
 woods adjacent to the field. There is 
 a rope swing from a very high tree    
 which swings out 40 feet to a height  
 of 20 feet above the ground. The      
 toilets arrangements are chemical. The
 children sit around the fire ater     
 dark. Nobody is allowed to bring      
 sweets or money. Sweets are given out 
 from time to time. The children like  
 to watch milking in the evening.
