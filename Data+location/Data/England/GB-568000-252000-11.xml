 owlinge is served by a 'Library Van'  
(from the nearby town of Sudbury) which
comes into the village for three       
quarters of an hour every fortnight,   
and is used by a small percentage of   
the population. There is also a        
bi-monthly news sheet The Cowlinge     
Courier which is free to every house   
and run by three residents of the      
village. They rely on donations both   
literary and monetary to keep this     
going. Most homes have both radio and  
television for both entertainment and  
current news, and there is a daily     
delivery of newspapers and magazines   
available to all houses.
