		<content>Courtaulds was built on Longridge Road 
in 1939 to manufacture Rayon to be used
in tyres. It ran for 7 years without   
the machinery being halted. At its peak
3,500 people were employed producing 1 
million pounds of tyre yarn and 450,000
pounds of garment rayon.               
Unemployment. When Nylon and Terylene  
made by ICI came on the market it was  
cheaper to produce than rayon.  This   
resulted in Courtaulds closing down in 
1979 losing 2,500 jobs.  The site is   
now being developed as Red Scar        
Industrial Estate facilitating 50      
firms. It is hoped that work will be   
provided here and across the road on   
the Rough Hey Trading Estate for some  
of the people who are unemployed in the
area.
