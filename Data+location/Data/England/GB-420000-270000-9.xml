		<content>{Mrs.Avloniti}and her husband came to  
 live in the village in Dec.1984.They  
 rent their house from Wroxall Abbey   
 School, where she{teaches.}She enjoys 
 living in the village,as she is fond  
 of the country,and she likes being    
 able to feel safe when out at night.  
 Her neighbours are supportive,and     
 and there is a good community spirit. 
 The only amenity she (and many        
 others) miss is a{'bus service.       
   Every{Sunday}she gets up at around  
 9am-9.30am,and makes breakfast.Then   
 she feeds the dog,and cat if it       
 arrives.Next she cleans the house and 
 walks the dog. At 11.30 she goes to   
 karate in Shirley until 2pm.Then she  
 goes to a{'takeaway',}or visits her   
 parents.Then she comes home and does  
 school work or watches TV. After her  
 evening meal she goes out for a drink,
 then works until bedtime at 11pm.     </content>
