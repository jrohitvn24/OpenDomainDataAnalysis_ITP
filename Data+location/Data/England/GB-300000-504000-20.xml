		<content>  As the village has grown and         
developed so the Church has flourished.
Several different religions are        
represented by the inhabitants but the 
majority are either members of the     
Church of England or the Roman Catholic
Church.It is thought the first church  
was built in 650A.D. on the site of St.
Bridgets Church.                       
  The old St. Bridgets Church is still 
used for services, but the more modern 
church of St. Johns in the centre of   
the village is the main place of       
worship.There is also a flourishing    
Home Church where services are held in 
members' homes.                        
  There are close ties between the     
Church and the village school.The      
pupils attend services at the beginning
and end of each term.They lead the     
Carol Services and Harvest Services    
attended by the whole community.       </content>
