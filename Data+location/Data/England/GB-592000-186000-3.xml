		<content> A TYPICAL FAMILY IN OUR AREA CONSISTS 
 OF A MOTHER, FATHER AND TWO           
 CHILDREN.THE MOTHER OFTEN HAS A FULL  
 TIME JOB AS WELL AS RUNNING THE HOME. 
 MOST MEN COMMUTE TO THEIR JOBS BUT    
 SOME WORK LOCALLY.  THE CHILDREN      
 ATTEND THE LOCAL PRIMARY SCHOOL OR    
 ARE BUSSED OUT TO THE SECONDARY SCHOOL
 AT ROCHFORD.   ONE CHILD, SARAH, WROTE
 THIS ABOUT HER HOME LIFE. "MY FAMILY  
 LIVE IN A SEMI DETACHED  HOUSE AND ARE
 REASONABLY WELL OFF.   MY PARENTS BOTH
 WORK, MY DAD ON A FARM AND MY MUM AS A
 REPRESENTATIVE OF A COSMETICS FIRM.   
 MY DAD EARNS ABOUT Â£200 PER WEEK BUT  
 HAS TO PAY ABOUT Â£50 TO THE GOVERNMENT
 IN TAX.  MY MUM IS ALWAYS GOING ON    
 ABOUT FASHION BUT FASHIONABLE CLOTHES 
 TO HER ARE FRUMPY TO ME.   HEALTH IS  
 AN IMPORTANT PART OF FAMILY LIFE AND  
 IF YOU EAT THE WRONG THINGS YOU WILL  
 BECOME FAT OR UNHEALTHY.  WE EAT A LOT</content>
