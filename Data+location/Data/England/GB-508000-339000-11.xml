		<content>  We have been out to survey the       
 dwellings in the area and we have     
 discovered that almost half of those  
 in the area are council owned,        
 semi_detatched houses. There are four 
 old peoples dwellings, approximately  
 fifteen detatched houses or cottages  
 and there are eleven farm houses.     
   The majority of the houses are made 
 from brick, seven of the cottages are 
 stone built and there are six timber  
 houses.                               
   There is very little new building,  
 only two new houses have been built in
 the past year and very few others     
 since the group of council properties 
 which were built in the late 1940's.  
   The farm buildings in the area and  
 the few stone cottages are the oldest 
 building. There still remain a few    
 tied cottages.                        
                                       </content>
