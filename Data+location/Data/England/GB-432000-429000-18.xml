		<title>18The Edge of the Area</title>
		<content>      We walked over the road towards  
{St. Hilda's church,}then walked over  
 the railway bridge then towards the   
{Cross Green pub.}We passed a poster:  
 It had Golden Virginia on it. Then we 
 crossed the road to walk on towards   
 the{Green Bridge.                     
      We carried on walking past more  
 factories then we turned the corner on
 to a long row of{metal works}and      
 factories on each side. It was smelly 
 in that area but no one was           
 complaining. In the{brick works}there 
 were square holes missing, for some   
 reason.                               
      When we crossed the road, we saw 
 a man who showed us how a clamp was   
 made and put together.                
      In this area it was very busy,   
 with men loading and unloading wagons.
