		<title>13A Day in the Life of Lisa</title>
		<content>   Today is the Thursday of my         
 half-term holiday.  I got up at 8.l5  
 instead of 7.45 which I do when going 
 to school. For breakfast I had some   
 toast and marmalade and a glass of    
 fruit juice. Because it is a nice day 
 I go round to my friend Michelle'S    
 house and we decide to go to          
 Newmillerdam to feed the ducks.       
   When we have fed the ducks we went  
 to the Beulay Cafe, which is opposite 
 the lake for a drink of pop.  In the  
 afternoon we both go to play with some
 friends who live in the nearby        
 Kettlethorpe Estate. There are some   
 playing fields here so we are able to 
 have a game of rounders.              
   By 5 p.m. Mum is home from work and 
 I have to go home for dinner which    
 will be ready for 6 p.m.when Dad gets 
 home.  In the evening I decide to stay
 in and watch television.              </content>
