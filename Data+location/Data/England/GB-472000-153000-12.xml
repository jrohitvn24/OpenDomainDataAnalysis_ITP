		<title>12JOURNEY TO SCHOOL FROM HOOK</title>
		<content> I come to school on a terrible bus.It 
 belongs to Newnham Coaches but we call
 them'Bones Boneshakers'because Mr Bone
 is the owner.There are 3 coaches-one  
 is a continental but like the rest is 
 really dilapidated. Jane,Sara and I   
 get on at Holt Lane-if it's raining   
 we're unlucky as the roof leaks and   
 lots of the seats get wet.We talk a   
 lot,mostly about school and our best  
 friends.Everyone thinks it's unfair we
 have to pay Â£2 a week because we are  
 just under 3 miles from Robert May's. 
 There is no refund even if there are  
 strikes or day's off.Top speed is     
 snail's pace-it's quicker to walk up  
 Dunley's Hill- so the short journey   
 takes about 15minutes.Mr Bone shouts a
 lot both at back seat 5th years and at
 the engine to go faster.If we did get 
 a lovely new bus it wouldn't be the   
 same.We always get there in the end.  </content>
