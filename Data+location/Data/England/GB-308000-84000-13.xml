		<title>13CHANGING TIMES IN OTTERTON.</title>
		<content> We asked  Mr Payne, Mrs Miller and Mr 
 and Mrs Saunders, who have all lived  
 in the village most of their life,    
 what they noticed about how times have
 changed in Otterton.                  
 Here is a summary:-                   
 1. Cob houses knocked down and rebuilt
 2. Development of new houses.         
 3. The Mill has turned from a working 
    mill into an exhibition place.     
 4. The population hasn't increased,   
    because years ago people had larger
    familes.                           
 5. More holiday makers visit Otterton 
    because of Ladram Bay Caravan Park.
 6. Years ago it used to be more of a  
    family community because you knew  
    everyone.                          
 7. There used to be a railway line,now
    closed.The station is now a house.
