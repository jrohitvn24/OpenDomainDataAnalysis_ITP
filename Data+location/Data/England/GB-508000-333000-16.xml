		<title>16A BILLINGBOROUGH MAN'S DAY</title>
		<content> I get up at half past six and at      
 seven o'clock I walk to the car park  
 to wait for Les and Martin.I go to    
 work in a yellow lorry-type van.I work
 for Bonshor Construction Ltd. and I   
 always work away from Billingborough. 
 We meet two more men at Grantham where
 we are working. If it is a hot day I  
 take my vest off.                     
  When I get home at half past five I  
 watch cricket and read the paper.     
 After tea I look at my plants and cut 
 the grass. At nine o'clock I go to bed
 and watch television.                 
  In my spare time I play football with
 my son. I used to manage a football   
 team called Rangers but it took up too
 much of my time.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
