		<content> There are no medical facilities in    
 Crookham Village itself. The local    
 dentists are in Fleet. The doctors'   
 surgeries are at Fleet or neighbouring
 Crondall. Hospital treatment can be   
 given either in the local hospital at 
 Fleet or in the district hospital at  
 Frimley Park. In 1985 the Fleet       
 hospital is under threat of closure   
 because of cuts in the NHS budget. The
 local populace object to this a)      
 because Frimley Park is already       
 over-used. Having been planned before 
 the mass in-migration to this part of 
 Hampshire, it was designed to serve a 
 population of 190,000. The population 
 is now 250,000 and growing.   b)      
 because the cost per patient in this  
 health region is already the lowest in
 the country and they feel it is wrong 
 to penalise an area that has proved   
 its efficiency.A decision is awaited. </content>
