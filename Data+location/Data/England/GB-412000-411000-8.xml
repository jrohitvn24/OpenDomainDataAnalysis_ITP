		<content>   The Huddersfield to Penistone       
 railway line is a prominant feature   
 of our 'D block'. It enters it from   
 the North in the outskirts of         
 Huddersfield near the former Berry    
 Brow station. Robin Hood and Honley   
 tunnels bring the line to Honley      
 station, overlooking the High School. 
 Climbing on a gradient of 1 in 100 the
 next station is reached after 1.5Km at
 Brockholes. This attractive station   
 has featured in the BBC comedy series,
 "Last of the Summer Wine". Immediately
 South of the station, at the point    
 where the line leaves the 'D block',  
 is the junction of the long abandoned 
 Holmfirth branch.                     
   The main line, opened in 1850, has  
 itself been under threat of closure   
 since 1963. Few passengers now use    
 the stations which have been unmanned 
 halts since 1961.                     </content>
