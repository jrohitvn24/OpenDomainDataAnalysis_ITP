		<title>14 LOCAL ISSUES:STRATFORD AREA</title>
		<content>  THE CONCERNS OF SUBURBAN STRATFORD   
INCLUDE: THE NEED TO HELP THE ELDERLY, 
PERHAPS BY PROVIDING MORE SHOPS IN RES-
IDENTIAL AREAS, THE STATE OF THE       
HOSPITAL AND TRAFFIC PROBLEMS.         
  TRAFFIC DENSITY IS HIGH DUE TO TOUR- 
ISM,AND HEAVY GOODS VEHICLES CROSSING  
THE AVON.MOST PEOPLE THINK THE SHOPS IN
STRATFORD ARE ADEQUATE BUT EXPENSIVE AS
THE NUMEROUS TOURISTS ARE WILLING TO   
PAY HIGH PRICES.A LARGER EMERGENCY UNIT
AT THE HOSPITAL WOULD MAKE IT MORE EFF-
ICIENT AS THE NEXT NEAREST HOSPITAL IS 
10 MILES AWAY.                         
  ALSO THE PLIGHT OF NEIGHBOURING VILL-
AGES IS WORRYING.LUDDINGTON IS TROUBLED
BY SMELLS FROM THE SEWAGE PLANT-THERE  
HAVE BEEN COMPLAINTS,MEETINGS,AND PET- 
ITIONS.ROAD ACCIDENTS HAVE MADE A SPEED
LIMIT PROPOSAL POPULAR.CLIFFORD CHAM-  
BERS HAS NO SHOP OR SCHOOL AND MAY BE- 
COME A DORMITORY VILLAGE TO STRATFORD. </content>
