		<title>14FOLK CUSTOMS - RANDWICK WAP</title>
		<content> Randwick Wap is a revival of a        
 medieval weaving fair.  Wap day is a  
 day of general fun where people go to 
 share in re-enactments of ancient     
 ceremonies and also to have fun and   
 buy from the stalls.  The Mopman      
 clears the way and the Mayor is       
 carried shoulder-high in procession to
 the Mayor's Pool where he is ducked to
 the strains of the Mayor's Song.  An  
 even older custom of the Wap is the   
 Cheese Rolling.  It is held on the    
 first Sunday in May, though originally
 on May Day.  Three Cheeses are carried
 in the procession to the Church.  They
 are decorated with flowers and        
 branches.  After a short service, the 
 three Cheeses are each rolled three   
 times in an anti-clockwise direction  
 around the Church.
