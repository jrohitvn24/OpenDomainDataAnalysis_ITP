		<title>09CHURCHES &amp; CHAPELS, HIGH HAM</title>
		<content> The first church in High Ham was      
 probably Saxon. Later a Norman church 
 was built. The font and some of the   
 tower remain from that period. The    
 present building is 16th century, with
 beautifully carved bench ends and an  
 impressive oak screen. The sacramental
 vessels include an Elizabethan chalice
 and cover. Low Ham church is really a 
 chapelry built in the 17th century on 
 the site of an earlier chapel. The    
 famous Hext plate dating from the 17th
 century is kept in a bank for safety. 
 The 2 churches,attended by some 12    
 people each,share a Vicar with 2 other
 churches. Zion Chapel in Henley and   
 the 19th century chapel in Low Ham are
 both well supported. Low Ham has a    
 congregation of 30-35 people at twice 
 weekly services. The Chapel Sunday    
 School has a roll of 20, there being  
 no Church Sunday School at present.   </content>
