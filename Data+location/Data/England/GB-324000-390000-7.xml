   The M.C.A. had long felt there was a
 need for a Centre to serve the Moreton
 area.  They had held a local survey   
 which had substantiated their opinion,
 and, under the aegis of the Manpower  
 Services Commission, the go ahead was 
 given.  Premises were provided in     
 unused classrooms at Lingham Primary  
 School and in l983 the Centre was     
 opened.                               
                                       
   The Centre now has a staff of l2 and
 these are some of the regular         
 activities that take place each week: 
 Playgroup, Morris Dancing, Mother and 
 Child Club, Pensioners' Luncheon      
 Club, Sequence Dancing, Break Dancing,
 Birchwood School of Dancing and Keep  
 Fit.
