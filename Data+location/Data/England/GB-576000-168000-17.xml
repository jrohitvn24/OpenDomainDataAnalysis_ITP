		<title>17Old Gillingham</title>
		<content> One highlight of our area is          
 Gillingham Green.  A  long time ago it
 was the centre of Gillingham and      
 indeed its church, St. Mary's, was    
 where Will Adams was baptised.It's    
 ancient cemetery is now a park.       
 The other highlight is Gillingham     
 Football Club, which is doing well in 
 the Third Division.  It has a famous  
 100 year old stand, sadly due for     
 demolition because of the Bradford    
 City fire disaster.                   
 Our section is split by a busy railway
 line,  that used to convey chalk from 
 the local quarry, which eventually    
 became the town dump and is now being 
 turned into playing fields.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
