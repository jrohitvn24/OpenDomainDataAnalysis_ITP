		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF...</title>
		<content>   {Susie Freeman(9)}On Saturday I got 
 up at 8am and opened the tennis club  
 with Dad for Cup Finals.  I put out   
 the Junior trophies and a flower      
 arrangement.  Lunch was a cheese roll.
 We watched matches all afternoon.  The
 adults' chocolate trophies melted in  
 the car.  I had a club tea of         
 sandwiches and cakes and went home at 
 8pm.                                  
{Holly Coles(9)}I got dressed then Dad 
 picked us up for his day. I sat in the
 front of the car.  At noon I watched  
 'Live Aid'.  We went home at 4pm and  
 dressed for Presdale's family party   
 for swimming and disco-ing.  Later we 
 watched 'Live Aid', then went to bed. 
 At 3am Mum woke us up to watch the    
 end.  I phoned up and donated Â£4.  I  
 cried at the end because we saw       
 starving Ethiopians.
