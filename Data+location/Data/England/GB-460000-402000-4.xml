		<content>  A large part of the wood(about 9     
 acres, once part of Sherwood Forest)  
 is used for recreation. Lots of people
 come to look round for wildlife and   
 insects. Allotments on the edge of    
 the wood where people keep poultry    
 and grow food(nuseries) and, in the   
 northern part a riding school,        
 drawing many people, take 9_10 acres. 
 8 acres of the wood is a sports ground
 (rugby).                              
{HISTORY:}The wood was given to the    
 corporation in 1840_50. Then it was   
 not a nature reserve, but still part  
 of Sherwood Forest. There is now a    
 railway line(built in 1910) running,  
 where an old road was once used by    
 coaches which would stop at the house 
 (built in 1861). There was once a     
 shooting lodge in the middle, near the
 house. This was used by Lord          
 Fitzwilliam and later by the warden.  </content>
