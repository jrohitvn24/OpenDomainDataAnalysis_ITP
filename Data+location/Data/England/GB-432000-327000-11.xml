		<content> The house was built when king George  
 was on the throne. It was at least    
 170 years old you could tell that     
 Georgian by the shape of the windows  
 and the fanlight above the door and   
 the tiles where very old.It was named 
 after an elm tree across the road but 
 it was chopped down due to Dutch elm  
 disease. Unlike Georgian town houses  
 which have three stories the house    
 only has two stories. The house has   
 been kept in the family ever since it 
 was built above the door was a brick  
 with J.R.M inscribed on its, the      
 initials of the builder. The house was
 a farm house which has probably       
 started in the industril  Revolvtion  
 to feed the growing town of Derby. It 
 still provides milk and meat for Derby
