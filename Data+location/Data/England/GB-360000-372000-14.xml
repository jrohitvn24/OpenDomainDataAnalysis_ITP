		<content>{Blacksmithing}goes back centuries but 
 people still do it now.There is a     
 Blacksmith in Weaverham Mr.D.T Wilson.
 Who gave us this information.Black    
 smiths now have a lot of electrical   
 machines so their job is easier.But   
 Blacksmiths still use these tools     
 Blacksmiths Horns,Hollow Tongs,Leg    
 Vices and welding equipment.Welding   
 took 2 people but now 1 person can do 
 it on their own.The fireplace is      
 called a forge this is where the metal
 is melted so you can bend it into any 
 shape you want.The anvil is used to   
 put the metal on and hit it hard with 
 a hammer to bend it. People think it  
 is a very interesting job. But you    
 have to pay bills and tax. It is a    
 very hard job. Blacksmiths produce    
 functional and ornamental metal work.
