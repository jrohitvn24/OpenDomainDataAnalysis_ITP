		<content>  I live at the Offenham Bridge.  I    
 wake up at 7.30, get dressed,washed   
 and go downstairs to help my dad take 
 all of the bottles out of the bottle  
 trolley and put them into the crates. 
 Then I put the full bottles on the    
 shelves ready for selling.  By that   
 time most of the boats are on their   
 way back to the boatyard because they 
 have to be back at 9.00am.  Then Igo  
 upstairs and watch television until   
 10.30am when I go and play with my    
 mates.                                
  We start getting busy at about 12.30 
 and we have about two boats in if it  
 is nice weather.  We usually close at 
 2.30 or 3.00.  By then most of the    
 customers have gone and I go outside  
 to collect the glasses.  We have our  
 tea at about 4.30 and I go upstairs   
 for a sleep.
