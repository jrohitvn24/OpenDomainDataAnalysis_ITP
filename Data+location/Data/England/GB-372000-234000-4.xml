		<content> Part of the area is in Hereford/      
 Worcester and is policed from Ledbury.
 The rest is policed by the Officer in 
 Charge at Staunton, who works eight   
 hour shifts. Additional cover comes   
 from Newent and from the Gloucester   
 sub-divisional headquarters at Lydney.
 The sub-division is under the control 
 of a Superintendent. The Gloucester   
 Division is the responsibility of a   
 Chief Superintendent.                 
 The local officer's work is varied.   
 Recently, he has dealt with several   
 road accidents, an abandoned puppy,   
 cases of forced entry into cars and   
 problems with vandals and poachers. He
 is responsible for checking shotgun   
 licences, farm animal movements and   
 other tasks. He also visits the three 
 schools in his large district as part 
 of his public relations duties. He    
 uses a police motor-cycle or bicycle. </content>
