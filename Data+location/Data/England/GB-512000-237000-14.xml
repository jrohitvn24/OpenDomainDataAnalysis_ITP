		<title>14CAMPTON CLAY TARGETS</title>
		<content>{Peacock Clay targets}are the oldest   
 firm in the industry producing and    
 selling their own product.            
     The firm was founded in 1954 by Mr
 Edward Thomas Peacock from an idea to 
 make clay pigeons for his own use.    
 After two years of experiment,many    
 burnt fingers and blisters , a machine
 was built to make clay pigeons of     
 saleable quality.                     
     Over the years they have developed
 other types of clays,mainly for       
 sporting shooting.In 1960 the first   
 clay rabbit was produced and 1966 saw 
 the first mini targets, now called    
 60mm. The battue went into production 
 in 1983.                              
    They have supplied targets to all  
 the National Championships so far this
 season.The latest being the English   
 Sporting to be held at Taverham,      
 Norwich , in July.                    </content>
