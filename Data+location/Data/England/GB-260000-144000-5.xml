		<content>    The area has been surveyed and     
 written about by members of the Combe 
 Martin Historical Society with the    
 assistance of friends and neighbours. 
                                       
      The photograph was supplied by   
 the Exmoor Park Warden and the        
 information was recorded on disk by a 
 member of the Society.                
                                       
      It is regretted that the         
 information is not more comprehensive 
 but the deadline only allowed about   
 ten days for the Society to collect   
 information on this block and the one 
 to the north of it.  This allowed no  
 time to take photographs and get them 
 processed and the only one we could   
 find is typical of the area but not   
 actually of part of it.
