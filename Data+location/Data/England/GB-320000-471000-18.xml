 We conducted a survey of father's jobs
 in Dalton C.of.E school.The most      
 popular job for dads is working at    
 Vickers.Vickers is a shipyard where   
 ships, especially submarines are built
 for the British Navy.Alot of dads work
 at Bowater Scott which is a paper     
 factory making toilet roll,tissues,and
 absorbent kitchen paper.A few work at 
 Glaxo which is a chemical factory     
 manufacturing mostly medical produce  
 such as ointment and pills.There are a
 few shopkeepers.Some fathers work at  
 the hospital but not as a doctor e.g. 
 an administrator,a porter,in the      
 laboratories.Some dads are unemployed.
 There were very few conpared to the % 
 of unemployed throughout the county.  </content>
