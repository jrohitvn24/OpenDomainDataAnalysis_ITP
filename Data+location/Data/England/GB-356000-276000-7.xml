		<content>     This is information about our     
 area.People who work and people       
 that don't work.                      
     We have got 41 people working in  
 our area and 24 people that are not   
 working in our block.There are also 14
 housewives.We thought that the        
 building trade would have had the most
 number of people in employment but    
 most people were farmers.There were 11
 farmers, 3 office workers and 5 in the
 building trade.For transport there    
 were 3 people and for factory work    
 there were also 3 and for a shop or   
 pub there were 4.There were 12 people 
 that worked at home.                  
     Distances for travelling to work  
 were as follows.  13 people had to    
 travel 1-5 miles. .Nine people had to 
 travel 6-10 miles and 7 people more   
 than 15 miles.
