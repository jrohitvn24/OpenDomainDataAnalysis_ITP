     In the mine's heyday,the older    
 farmhouse(now farm buildings) was     
 partly a public house with a dance    
 floor in one of the upper rooms.      
 Another farm building was the smithy  
 for the mine.Mr.Howe and his partner  
 milk Friesian cows and run a flock of 
 Suffolk sheep. Mr.Howe says that the  
 Suffolks unlike the Oxfords which he  
 used to keep give little trouble in   
 lambing and the ewes are good mothers.
     The crop nowadays is grass grown  
 for hay and silage though until a few 
 years ago potatoes were grown for     
 retail sales.During the war Mr.Howe   
 grew swedes,cow cabbages and oats for 
 stock feeding.He stacked the sheaves  
 of oats in barns and banged the seeds 
 out against a large piece of stone    
 instead of threshing!
