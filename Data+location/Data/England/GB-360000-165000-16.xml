		<title>16Farming In Whitchurch</title>
		<content> Farming was formerly the main         
 occupation in the Whitchurch area.    
 There were numerous,long-established, 
 small farms,most employing several    
 local people.The oldest being the     
 medieval Lyons Court. Much farmland,  
 particularly around Whitchurch        
 village,has been sold for residential 
 development,links with the past being 
 retained in estate and road names.    
 Nowadays farming is still very much   
 in evidence,but the pattern has       
 changed.There are fewer farms now but 
 of larger size.Often,small adjacent   
 farms have been amalgamated.Except    
 for Newbarn Farm,these are all        
 family run and few local people now   
 work on the land.                     
 The existing farms are all livestock  
 units with dairy cattle,beef cattle,  
 sheep and pigs all being kept and     
 crops grown mainly for animal feed.   </content>
