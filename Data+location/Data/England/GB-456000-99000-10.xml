		<content>   {Grange Farmhouse}is all that       
 remains of an 1191 acre farm.It is    
 bounded by heathland, the{Wild Grounds

 housing estate.                       
 The original part of the farmhouse    
 dates from 1570.It was probably built 
 on the site of the grange belonging to
 the monks of{Quarr Abbey,}on the Isle 
 of Wight,who were given a grant of    
 land at{Cherc.}It was part of the     
 estate of{Rowner}which was given to   
 the{Brune}family in{1277.             
 The house itself was extended over the
 years.It was purchased by{Gosport     
{Council}in 1966, but it was not until 
 1978-9 that it was renovated.It has   
 been divided into three separate      
 houses,which are occupied by council  
 employees.The{Victorian}farmyard      
 buildings are utilised as workshops   
 and offices.                          </content>
