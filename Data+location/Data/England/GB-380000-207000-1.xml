		<title>01HARESFIELD &amp; STANDISH AREA</title>
		<content>  The main feature of our block is the 
 steep escarpment of the western edge  
 of the Cotswold Hills from which there
 are many fine views over the Severn   
 Vale, especially from Haresfield      
 Beacon. There are many valleys and    
 dells, mostly used for rough grazing. 
 The roads are steep and winding. On   
 the south east side of our block, on  
 the hills lie Randwick Woods.         
  The western edge of the block is down
 in the Severn Vale. This level land is
 intensively farmed. The railway line  
 from Gloucester to Bristol and Stroud 
 runs here. The small villages of      
 Standish, Little Haresfield and       
 Stroud Green lie in our block,together
 with parts of Whiteshill, Ruscombe,   
 and a small part of Haresfield. The   
 nearest town is Stroud.
