		<title>14A Teenager's view of Hunton</title>
		<content>   Young people,aged 15_23 or so,living
 in Hunton have generally found it easy
 to get a job  at the end of schooling.
 Several towns are within easy reach of
 here so we feel that we have a greater
 chance of finding work.  Vacancies are
 found through relations,friends or the
 "D.and S." newspaper.                 
   We can  be  roughly split into three
 groups. Some of us attend  colleges to
 start off  our  careers.  Others begin
 employment straight away and there are
 those  who  have been occasionally  in
 and out of jobs. Youth unemployment in
 Hunton is quite rare.  Despite lack of
 public services  travelling causes few
 difficulties. Our parents  or  friends
 give us lifts until we can get our own
 transport.  Most of us gather  at  the
 greens on a night to talk and  have  a
 laugh. On the whole we like living and
 being involved in this village.       </content>
