		<title>15THE ALLOTMENTS</title>
		<content> The allotments were made in 1939,just 
 before the Second World War began.    
 There used to be allotments on        
 Ridge Balk Lane but these were        
 destroyed when the New Estate was     
 built.The allotments were mainly for  
 people to grow their own vegetables   
 during the war.Each allotment is      
 approximately 495square metres.To rent
 an allotment it costs Â£9.00 per year  
 and altogether there are ninety       
 allotments.Some of the men there keep 
 pigeons,some have goats,chickens,hens 
 or rabbits.They grow many things such 
 as brussel sprouts,cucumbers,peas,    
 potatoes,onions,beetroot,cabbage and  
 lettuce.Many retired men keep them to 
 occupy their minds aswell as for      
 enjoyment.
