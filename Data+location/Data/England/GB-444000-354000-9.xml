		<content>  At 6.00pm. we have our tea. For our  
 tea we have egg,beans,chips and bacon.
 After we have had our tea we wash the 
 pots. We do not like washing the pots!
  After we have done them we go outside
 to play football with our friends.We  
 win usually. We get hungry and so we  
 buy a bag of crisps. Then we go out on
 our bikes.We have a B.M.X and a       
 Raleigh racer and we go on a B.M.X    
 assault course near Broadmeadows.     
 Occasionally we fall off our bikes.   
  After playing out we have a bath.    
 After that we sit and watch television
 but soon it is time for bed. We do not
 like going to bed early but we have to
 so that we can get up early the       
 following morning.                    
  We clean our teeth and get ready for 
 bed.
