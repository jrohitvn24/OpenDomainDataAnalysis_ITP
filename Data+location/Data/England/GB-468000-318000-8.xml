		<content> On Sundays all of my family go to     
 have a swim at the swimming baths and 
 play games in the big pool.Sometimes  
 my sister and I go into the little    
 swimming pool to play.The lady in     
 charge sometimes tells us off and     
 sends us back into the big pool again.
 We get out at ten o'clock and Mum and 
 Sam get us each a drink of anything we
 want and crisps and sweets to eat if  
 we want as well.We all go home and my 
 Mum cooks us our Sunday lunch.We      
 mostly have chicken or roast beef and 
 roast potatoes.We have a pudding like 
 apple crumble.In the afternoon on     
 Sundays we don't do much until        
 teatime.We only have a small tea      
 because we have had a big lunch.Then I
 go to bed about half past nine.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
