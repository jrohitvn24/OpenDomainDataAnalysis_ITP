		<title>08TRADE IN THE B/WALTHAM</title>
		<content>   This part of Hampshire, owned by the
 Bishop of Winchester,has always been  
 farming land. When the Bishop built   
 his palace many new people were drawn 
 into the area.                        
   Bishops Waltham was a convenient    
 stopping place for travellers goint to
 and from Portsmouth, Southampton,     
 Winchester and London. This also drew 
 people in the village.                
   In 1208 some of the palace was sold 
 and the present street plan was laid  
 down. In 1784 there were sixty entries
 in the Trade Directory, by 1853 there 
 were ninety-two and by 1875 one       
 hundred and seventeen. It steadily    
 continued increasing and by 1931 there
 were nearly two hundred and the number
 is still increasing.                  
   There are few necessities that are  
 not available for purchase in the     
 town nowadays.                        </content>
