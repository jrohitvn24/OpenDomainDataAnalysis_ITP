		<title>09Norton Green</title>
		<content> The Green covers an area of about 2   
 football pitches. It is roughly       
 circular with a road running through  
 the middle. In the centre is a small  
 pond known as the duck pond and a     
 small group of houses. The church     
 overlooks the Green  which is bordered
 by tall trees along one side.         
 It is the site of an ancient market   
 and many other village fayres and     
 events have been held here.           
 Originally it was the centre of       
 village life and for many years there 
 was a blacksmith (who used the duck   
 pond to cool his hot horseshoes,      
 cartwheels etc) a bakehouse and a     
 tannery. One of the buildings in the  
 centre has a large clock by which the 
 village people kept there own clocks  
 right.
