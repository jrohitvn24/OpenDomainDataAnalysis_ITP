		<content> The present owner of Low Middleton    
 Hall is Miss.Duff. Low Middleton Hall 
 is a very interesting place to look   
 at. It was built in 1721 by the       
 Killinghall family and the front part 
 of the house added in the 19th        
 century. It is now a large house made 
 from 2 inch Dutch bricks,pantile roof 
 and lots of windows. On an original   
 wall at the back of the house is an   
 interesting mark-it is an insurance   
 sign. It means that if you had a fire,
 a man came,checked to see if you had  
 their sign,and would then send his    
 fire brigade. There is a walled garden
 with out buildings which used to be   
 the servants quarters,stables for     
 horses and a water pump which still   
 pumps water electrically from their   
 own well.At the end of the garden     
 there was a Ha-ha,a deep ditch which  
 kept the cattle out of one's garden.  </content>
