   ROADE STATION WAS OPENED IN 1851 BY 
THE LONDON -NORTH-WESTERN-RAILWAY      
COMPANY.TWO MORE LINES WERE LATER ADDED
TO MAKE THE NORTHAMPTON LOOP.          
   THE STATION WAS CLOSED IN 1964 AND  
THE LAST TRAIN TO STOP  WAS ON SUNDAY  
6TH SEPTEMBER.IT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE    
BRITSH RAIL WANTED TO SAVE MONEY.      
  IN 1984 THE PARISH COUNCIL AND A     
GROUP OF VILLAGERS TRIED TO GET IT     
RE-OPENED.THEY THINK IT WOULD BE MORE  
USEFUL NOW BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE      
PEOPLE IN ROADE.                       
  SOME PEOPLE STILL THINK IT WOULDN'T  
BE USEFUL BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE HAVE CARS
NOW.                                   
  AT THE MOMENT BRITSH RAIL AND THE    
COUNCIL ARE STILL DECIDING WHO WILL PAY
FOR THE STATION IF IT IS RE-BUILT.
