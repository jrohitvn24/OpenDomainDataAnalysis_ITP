		<content>      As you walk down North Street    
 keep to the footpath because there is 
 a lot of traffic.   There are 16      
 non-food shops, 8 restaurants, 7      
 building societies, a garden centre a 
 library and a fire station.           
      The{FIRE STATION}has four fire   
 engines.   There is a training tower. 
 The firemen's outfits are next to the 
 fire engines.   When there is a fire  
 the firemen slide down the pole, take 
 off their shoes and jump in their     
 boots.                                
{     HORNCHURCH BRANCH LIBRARY}has a  
{wide range }of books.   It has a      
 children's section and an adult's     
 section.   Upstairs there is a record 
 section and a place for students to   
 study.   The entrance hall usually has
 an art exhibition.   You are allowed  
 to borrow three books for three weeks.
