		<title>06Golf - The Game</title>
		<content> I live next to the{Golf Links}and I am
 a junior player with my two brothers. 
 It is an eighteen hole course. It is a
 good sport. I go in a lot of good     
 competitions and my brother has won a 
 cup. You use clubs to hit a ball onto 
 a green. At first you drive it        
 hard,then you put it gently in the    
 hole which is marked with a flag. It  
 is very popular especially with those 
 who can afford it.The course is five  
 miles long. There are many rules.If   
 you play a lost ball it counts as a   
 penalty.Playing another ball off the  
 tee after losing  a golf ball it      
 becomes your third shot.Golf is       
 shown on{television}a great deal.The  
 pro-celebrity games are very good fun.
 There are many sorts of clubs.Some are
 special for putting,some are used for 
 driving the ball right down the       
 course.I love golf.                   </content>
