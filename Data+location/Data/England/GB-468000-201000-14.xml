		<title>14Transport in the area</title>
		<content>There are no rivers or railway running 
through our area. We have no airports. 
Tetsworth has a bus service because it 
is on the A40 route between London and 
Oxford. Once a week (Tuesdays) there is
a morning and an afternoon bus to Thame
for the weekly market. Older children  
travel to school on a school bus. There
are very few homes without their own   
transport and many families have more  
than one vehicle. There are a few      
people who travel about on horseback or
with a horse and carriage. During the  
winter months the roads, especially to 
Thame, are liable to be closed by      
drifting snow. The constant hum of     
the many cars and lorries using the M40
which runs to the south of the area    
often reminds us of the volume of      
traffic the motorway carries past the  
area.
