		<content>{The area  we surveyed  includes the   
{seafront at Brighton  and most of the 
{town centre. Brighton is a seaside    
{towncontaining many areas of historic 
{importance.The town centre is an      
{amalgam of commerce and residential   
{buildings.Along the seafront there are
{two impressive piers.Although mainly a
{tourist centre Brighton has also      
{developed a strong commercial side to 
{its activities.The population of our  
{block has grown greatly since the     
{town became a tourist                 
{attraction.Party Conferences are held 
{in Brighton each year which provide   
{agreat opportunity for businesses in  
{Brighton and for terrorists. Graham   
{Greene made the area famous with his  
{novel Brighton Rock.
