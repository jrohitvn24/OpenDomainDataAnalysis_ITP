		<content> In 1977 Primary and Secondary Schools 
 were re_organised into a three tier   
 system. Three Middle Schools for 9 to 
 13 yr. old children were built.       
 The children at this school           
 transfer at 9 years old to the        
 Allhallows Middle School.This         
 reduced considerably the numbers      
 in the primary schools and we became a
 First School with 5 to 9 yr olds.  The
 Hundred of Hoo Comprehensive School   
 caters for 13 to 18 yr old children   
 The system has not been adopted as yet
 in any other part of the Medway       
 Education Division.                   
 The original intention was to abolish 
 tests at 11 yrs which channelled      
 children into grammar or seconary     
 modern schools and provide equal      
 education opportunity for all in a    
 comprehensive school.
