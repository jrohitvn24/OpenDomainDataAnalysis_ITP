		<content>{Smeer Hall}(in earlier times Smere    
 Hawe and Haugh) is well-hidden from   
 the Roeburndale roads. The land is not
 good for farming but coal was once    
 mined at Smeer Hall pits. The house   
 dates from the seventeenth century and
 some original latticed windows remain.
 There is a courtroom where prisoners  
 were tried by a travelling judge and a
 cellar where prisoners were kept      
 before going to Outhwaite prison.     
 At{Outhwaite,}there are about seven   
 houses now used for storage and for   
 animals, and one still used as a      
 farmhouse. There is the old prison,   
 stone stocks and a whipping post.     
 The grander{Cragg Hall}was built by   
 the Bateson family in the seventeenth 
 century and enlarged in Georgian and  
 Victorian times. The gloomy pond in   
 the grounds may be an old quarry.
