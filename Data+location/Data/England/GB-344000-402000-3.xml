		<title>03Bickerstaffe Parish Church</title>
		<content>At present, the main doors are being   
restored because during the Victorian  
period the parishoners painted the     
doors constantly so removing any trace 
of the original wood finish. The hinges
are being made by a local farmer to the
original specification. This has       
posed some problems because they were  
originally made by a local blacksmith  
and there are no longer any around.No  
two hinges are alike.                  
       The Alter is unusual because in 
the centre of its panelled front is    
the star of David, a jewish symbol not 
usually seen in the Church of England. 
The church is also unusual in that it  
has a pair of padded double doors close
to the main front doors .              
     The church has eight bells which  
are worked by a Clarion.These were     
presented by Alderman Sir S.T.         
Rosbotham and Lady Rosbotham in 1933.  </content>
