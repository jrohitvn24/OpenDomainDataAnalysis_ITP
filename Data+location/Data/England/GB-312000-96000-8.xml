		<title>08COMBE ESTATE 1  R MARKER</title>
		<content> The Combe Estate is one of the oldest 
 estates in Devon, and comprises       
 tenanted farms and a substantial area 
 of woodland together with most of the 
 houses in the village of Gittisham and
 the oriinal family home, Combe House, 
 which is now let out as a Hotel.      
 The estate has been in the hands of   
 one family since 1615, when it was    
 acquired by Thomas Putt. It passed to 
 the Marker family in 1846. Rihard     
 Marker, the present owner, came over  
 from Canada to take up his            
 inheritance, but regards hmself only  
 as a custodian of the Estate whose job
 is to keep it intact and thriving to  
 pass on to future generations. The    
 management of the Estate is carried   
 out by Mr Marker and his professional 
 advisors. The day-to-day running is   
 carried out by the agents but regular 
 meetings establish Estate policy.     </content>
