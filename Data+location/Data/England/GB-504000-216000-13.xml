		<title>13Guides in Markyate</title>
		<content> Another time we made a chocolate cake 
 with the figures 75 on it and all ate 
 it.We also go on outings.Sometimes we 
 walk to Whipsnade where there is a    
{TREE CATHEDRAL.}Sometimes we get      
 enrolled on one of these visits.I was 
 enrolled on the top of Dunstable      
 Downs.We raise funds by such things as
 Jumble Sales and Bazaars.My favourite 
 game at Guides is Rounders.           
             {Cubs                     
 Every Tuesday at six thirty we meet at
 the bottom of Pickford Hill in the    
 Youth &amp; Community Centre, get in our  
 "sixes" and give our "sixer" 25p.Then 
 we have "Grand Howl".After that we    
 play games like "Bull-dog","Cat &amp;     
 Mouse"or "Piggy-back Wrestling",or we 
 work on our Badges such as "First Aid"
 "Handyman" or "Campers".Then we have  
 "Grand Howl",a prayer and then get    
 dismissed.                            </content>
