		<title>06SCHOOLS IN GENERAL</title>
		<content>   There are few schools in this rural 
 area, usually they have a low number  
 of pupils, like in Peterchurch Primary
 School there are 100 pupils and in    
 Fairfield High School there are 200   
 pupils.                               
   In winter there is usually a low    
 attendence in schools because of the  
 weather. Snow and ice is a big problem
 which can cause some people to be cut 
 off for a couple of days, but coaches 
 have to be used to take children to   
 school. And so the roads have to be   
 totally clear of snow before they can 
 run. Also the buses sometimes break   
 down because of the cold which can be 
 severe.                               
   Now in the local area there are no  
 school dinners. with children either  
 going home for dinner, eating         
 sandwichs or going to the chip van.
