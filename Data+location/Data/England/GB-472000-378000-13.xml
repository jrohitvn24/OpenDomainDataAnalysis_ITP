		<title>13ECOLOGY IN GROVE PARISH.</title>
		<content> The public footpaths in the area      
 radiate from the village of           
 Grove.Generally,they are well marked  
 at their origins,but are not          
 frequently used.No other person was   
 ever met along their routes during the
 course of our survey.All were         
 passable,but only with the use of a   
 map and by negotiating high styles and
 often'mature vegetation.              
 Rabbits,hares,foxes and field mice    
 were regularly seen.Butterflies noted 
 included Cabbage White,Totoise        
 Shell,Red Admiral and Small           
 Heath.Swallows,crows barn owls,       
 sparrows,pigeons,and cuckoos were     
 observed.Castle Hill wood attracted   
 much of this animal life.This small   
 mount,just north of the village is    
 belived to have been occupied by the  
 Roman military.Adjacent is the Anglian
 Water Authority local reservoir.      </content>
