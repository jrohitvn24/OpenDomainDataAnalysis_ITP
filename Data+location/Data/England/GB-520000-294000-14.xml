		<title>14How Traffic Affects our Area</title>
		<content> To the west of our area is{Fletton    
{Parkway}.It part of the Parkway system
 which now almost surrounds            
 Peterborough.It makes it easy for     
 people who live in Stanground and     
 Farcet to get to other parts of       
 Peterborough quickly.The Parkway      
 connects with the A.1.and we have a   
 lot of tfaffic coming through         
 Stanground to get onto this road from 
 the east.                             
   We stood on the bridge over the     
 Parkway for half an hour and we       
 counted the traffic.We found that     
 there were about twice as many cars as
 lorries using the road,and that the   
 number of vehicles we saw were about  
 equal in both directions.Most of the  
 lorries we saw were from factories in 
 Peterborough,and several were going to
 and from the brickyards at{Woodston   
{and Yaxley.}                          </content>
