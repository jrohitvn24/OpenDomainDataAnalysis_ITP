 In 1957 the natural woodland was cut  
 down and replanted with Norway Spruce,
 Douglas Firs and Scotch Firs. Rides   
 are left between the rows to protect  
 the trees from gales and fire, which  
 can also spread via rabbit holes and  
 mole hills. There are some 50' Beech  
 trees which were planted in 1930.     
                                       
 The trees are cut to order at the saw 
 mill in the wood. The bark is shredded
 to be used as a mulch. Fir tops are   
 supplied to Hickstead for show jumping
 fences.The wood is used for pulp,     
 garden fences and posts.              
                                       
 Fox and mink have to be kept down by  
 shooting but rabbits are in reasonable
 numbers and do not cause a problem.   
 Most wildlife does not like this type 
 of woodland.                          </content>
