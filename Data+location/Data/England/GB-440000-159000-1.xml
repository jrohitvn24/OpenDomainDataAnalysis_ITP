		<content> The village of Woolton Hill is        
 situated in the parish of East        
 Woodhay.The parish is made up of lots 
 of different hamlets such as Woolton  
 Hill, Broad Layings, The Mount,       
 Hollington, East End, Ball Hill, Hat  
 Common, North End, Gore End and part  
 of Highclere.The northen boundary of  
 the parish is the River Enbourne and  
 the southern boundary runs along The  
 Ridgeway.The parish is in the northen 
 Hampshire lowlands.Although the A.343 
 runs nearby it is still a fairly rural
 area but is growing in population,    
 because the M.4 and the inter city    
 trains make London easily accessible. 
 It is four miles south of Newbury     
 which is the nearest shopping area.
