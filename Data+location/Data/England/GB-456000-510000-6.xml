		<content>{Cliff Rigg Quarry}is a rough and      
 rugged crack in the landscape         
 overlooked by Roseberry Topping.Part  
 of Cliff Rigg Quarry is known as      
 the Elephant Hole as it is so big .To 
 reach it from Roseberry School walk up
 Roseberry Crescent until you reach the
 Public footpath.Follow across the     
 fields ,past the railway bridge and   
 you will soon see Cliff Rigg Quarry.  
 Geologists often take samples from the
 Quarry .There are two main kinds of   
 stone {Sandstone}and{Whinstone.}People
 also search for{fossils.}The sides of 
 the Quarry are mainly scree.Although  
 it is rather dangerous in the         
 Quarry,there is an abundance of plant 
 life crawling the flimsy walls,which  
 crumble more after every hard winter. 
 In June nature is in full bloom wild  
 flowers,mosses and grasses grow and it
 is covered in gorse .                 </content>
