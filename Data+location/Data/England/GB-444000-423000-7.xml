		<content> We conducted a survey of the three    
 schools in our area to try and        
 discover whether many people came to  
 live in the area from outside.The per-
 centage of the poll returned was Round
 -hill 56%, Redhill 63%, Airedale First
 37%.We questioned only the parents of 
 the children at school and did not go 
 back to the previous generation More  
 people appear to have moved into Ferry
 bridge (56%) than into Airedale (45%).
 Approximately one third appear to have
 moved into their present house from   
 within a 5 mile radius of where they  
 now live and about the same number    
 from other places in Yorkshire.About  
 17% have moved into Ferrybridge from  
 the N.E.,12.5% have moved into Aire-  
 dale from the south,3% from Germany.  
 Some of these have been in the armed  
 forces.More people have moved into    
 Ferrybridge because of their jobs.    </content>
