		<title>07VOLUME OF TRAFFIC</title>
		<content> The A.20 connecting Ashford and       
 Maidstone is a very important route   
 from the coast and as a result the    
 volume of traffic has steadily        
 increased over the years.  While this 
 is unavoidable it has brought         
 problems to villages along its route. 
 Harrietsham is divided into east and  
 west areas as a result which makes    
 difficulties for people wanting to    
 cross the road.  In recent years a    
 pedestrian crossing with traffic      
 lights has been installed at the      
 eastern end of the village near "The  
 Roebuck" restaurant.  Perhaps the most
 notable change is the growth in size  
 of heavy lorries.  This has an        
 unexpected result in that since many  
 are too big to pass beneath the       
 railway bridge they have to use side  
 roads, causing difficulties there.
