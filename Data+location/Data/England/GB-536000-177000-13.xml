		<title>13Greenwich Hospital.</title>
		<content>Greenwich Hospital is kept in very good
order.Every morning the hospital is    
cleaned from top to bottom.All the     
nurses are very helpful and very loving
with the old people. when someone is   
rushedin from an accident they always  
know what to do and thay dont panic.   
There are escalators going from each   
floor, so you dont have to climb       
hundreds of stairs.also there is a     
tiny little chapel the hospital. its a 
very nice chapel and the priest who    
says the mass is nice too.             
when i had to go to greenwich hospital 
because i fell over i,was pretty scared
because i,ve never liked hospitals.When
i got there all the nurses made me     
welcome and comfortable. They looked   
after me pretty well because i don,t   
like being alone.Evey morning i was the
first person awake.A teacher came in   
every morning                          </content>
