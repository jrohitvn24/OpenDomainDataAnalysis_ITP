		<title>13LOCAL HISTORY-BUMBLES GREEN</title>
		<content> A middle-aged resident recalled that  
 the annual fair,held in the grounds of
 Nazeing Park school,enticed his       
 grand-father to cycle from            
 Ongar,Essex whilst in more            
 contemporary times other large houses 
 in the area have housed famous names  
 from the stage and the football field.
 Rivilanes dating from the dissension  
 caused by the civil war were blamed   
 for the social coolness between the   
 two parts of the village.The          
 traditional "beating of the bands" is 
 still carried on whilst other village 
 entertainments include flower shows   
 and animal events at Harolds Park     
 farm.                                 
 Bumbles Green was thought to be an    
 ideal place to live,just far enough   
 away from Harlow New town although one
 man blamed Harlow for "speeding up our
 lives"                                </content>
