		<content>     There are approximately 30 members
 of our  local  Women's Institute. This
 branch started 63 years ago. There are
 twelve members  of the  Committee. The
 Officers  this year  are  Mrs.J.Little
 (Secretary), Mrs.P.Hanshaw (Treasurer)
 and Mrs.J.Hurlstone (President). There
 are elections each year.              
     They meet on the second  Wednesday
 of each month in the  W.I.Hut. Usually
 there is  some business  to  discuss ,
 but then there is  probably  a speaker
 who  talks about  and/or  demonstrates
 their  own particular skill.  The idea
 is to educate country women  in crafts
 cookery and general knowledge. In May,
 they held their meeting in  school  so
 that the  children  could  demonstrate
 their skill  on  the  handbells  which
 belong to the  W.I.. They are going to
 come again in  January  for  handbells
 but also to see how we use  computers.</content>
