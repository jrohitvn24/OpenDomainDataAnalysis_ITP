		<content> In the centre of the village of The   
 Lea adjacent to the old disused road  
 near the Old Mill there is a Building 
 Plot offered for sale at Â£15,000.     
 Also close by, the residents view with
 concern the Bohemian cum 'Gay'        
 fraternity that appear to use Lea     
 House as a Lodging house.             
 The local farmers are very concerned  
 about getting in the harvest, not only
 the grass as hay or as silage, that   
 being the second crop but also the    
 barley, wheat and  the potato yield   
 due to the atrocious Summer of rain   
 and more rain.                        
 After twenty years there appears hope 
 that The Lea Church of England        
 (Voluntary Aided) Primary School will 
 get a new classroom by the beginning  
 of the new School Year in September.  
 The Governors had hoped for an        
 extension to the present School.      </content>
