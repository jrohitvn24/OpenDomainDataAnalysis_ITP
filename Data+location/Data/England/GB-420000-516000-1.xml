 The area is in County Durham,         
 about three kilometres west of        
 Darlington. The{geology}comprises     
 Magnesian Limestone overlain by       
 glacial drift. The height ranges from 
 sixty metres to eighty seven metres,  
 with a southerly aspect. The Cocker   
 Beck runs south-easterly to join the  
 Skerne at Darlington. The{landscape   
 consists of gently undulating         
 farmland, which is predominantly      
 arable. There are only two{settlements
 which are to the north of the area,   
 Denton  GR 218189 and Walworth GR     
 233188. The major{communications}links
 are the B6279, which cuts across this 
 area from north-west to south-east,   
 and Dere Street, a Roman road which   
 runs north to south.
