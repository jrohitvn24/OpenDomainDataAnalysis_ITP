		<title>07SAND PROCESSING TECHNIQUES</title>
		<content> Sand is screened by passing it        
 through piano wire mesh to remove     
 anything above 3/36 inches size. The  
 screens are double layer which means  
 that the top layer is larger so that  
 big lumps can not fall on to the      
 piano wires . After screening the sand
 is washed through vibrating screens   
 filled with water jets to break up    
 and remove clay and other large       
 particles.                            
                                       
 Drying and grading comes next when    
 the sand is passed through oilfired   
 rotary barrels before going to the    
 grading screens. Here it is sorted    
 into 4 main grades varying from 2mm to
 250 microns over a four deck rotex    
 screen.                               
                                       
 The sand is then transported in       
 50kg bags or sent to storage silos.   </content>
