		<title>15A stanger to Hazelbury Bryan</title>
		<content>   Life in Hazelbury Bryan is very     
 different from London in many ways.   
 The population in London is very,dense
 but here it is very scattered. The    
 school in London is very large. It has
 310 pupils and 13 classes, but in     
 Hazelbury Bryan school there are just 
 75 pupils and 3 classes. My friends in
 London are more fashion concious than 
 children in Hazelbury Bryan. They are 
 into pop music and amusement arcades  
 in London and usualy get into trouble 
 very often. the style of the buildings
 in London is much more modern than the
 thatched cottages in Hazelbury Bryan. 
 Many people in London have to have    
 tripple-glazed windows because of the 
 noise and the traffic pollution. I'd  
 never seen lichens before coming to   
 Hazelbury Bryan.
