		<title>01HESSLE &amp; ANLABY:INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> Housing in this area is very varied.In
 Anlaby there are mainly postwar or    
 inter-war semi-detached houses whereas
 in Hessle there are older terraced    
 houses. Both are typical suburban     
 middle-class areas. Leisure facilities
 are sparse but have been recently     
 improved by the building of Hessle    
 Library which,due to its vast size,   
 attracts people from the vicinity,    
 including Hull. The only other        
 facilities available are bowling      
 greens and numerous pubs. The dominant
 land cover to the west is arable      
 farming with scattered plant          
 nurseries. Industry is found on the   
 very outskirts of the urban           
 settlement,particularly around Anlaby,
 and consists of light manufacturing   
 firms. The road network is fairly     
 complex with several inter-connecting 
 routes and a main arterial road.      </content>
