		<title>03Farming in the Harden Area</title>
		<content> There are two sorts of farming        
 carried on in this area, beef and     
 dairy. This is because the land is    
 quite hilly and a large area is       
 moorland and rough pasture. Therefore 
 it is more difficult to grow cereal   
 crops on this land.                   
 The farm buildings are usually very   
 old as farming has been carried on in 
 this area for many years.             
 The beef cattle are sent to market 3  
 or 4 times a year. The farmer also    
 gets new stock to fatten up at these  
 times.                                
 The dairy farmer milks his cows twice 
 a day, morning and evening. A tanker  
 calls to collect the milk once a day  
 then it is taken to a local dairy for 
 bottling.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
