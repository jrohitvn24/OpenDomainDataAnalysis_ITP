 This area of{England}is basically     
 rural. Much of the block is taken up  
 by the {Ashdown Forest.}The land is   
 gently undulating with good clay soils
 in the vales. The forest comprises a  
 variety of deciduous and coniferous   
 trees with large areas of open space  
 covered in heather.By South Eastern   
 standards the area is sparsely        
 populated. Surrounding the forest are 
 small farms, but many of these are now
 used as country residences or small   
 holdings for the wealthy landowners. {
{Housing}is expensive in this area with
 many large, detatched properties in   
 and around the village and on the edge
 of the forest. The{A22}is the only    
 major road passing through the area on
 its way from{London}to{Eastbourne.}   
 This is basically an affluent area.
