		<title>05New Forest Pigs.</title>
		<content>       Pigs and the New Forest have a  
 "love/hate" relationship.If pigs were 
 allowed to roam the Forest throughout 
 the year they could cause considerable
 damage by rooting with their snouts.  
 As they root up the grass looking     
 for seeds and fleshy roots of plants  
 they can damage large amounts of      
 Forest grassland.                     
   To get over this problem pig        
 owners who have the right to pannage  
 are given permission to let their     
 pigs into the Forest for not less     
 than 60 days a year.The pigs have to  
 have a ring put through their snouts  
 to stop them rooting.The "pannage     
 season" is usually between October    
 and November,the Deputy Surveyor of   
 the Forestry Commission deciding the  
 dates. Owners of ponies are grateful  
 to the pigs-acorns are poisonous for  
 ponies.                               </content>
