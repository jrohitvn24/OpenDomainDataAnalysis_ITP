		<content>They have an internal chimney breast &amp; 
circular stair and were built by masons
for themselves on waste ground- tightly
packed so there was little space for   
sanitation or veg patch, and usually   
with a thatched roof. The 18TH CENTURY 
brought 13 small houses (two have been 
inns), 1 small farmhouse and 1 large   
farmhouse associated with the 'model'  
farmyard now converted for small indus-
try. The VICTORIAN YEARS brought a chu-
rch by the architect George Street, a  
Men's Reading Room, a Church School &amp;  
Schoolhouse, and a Wesleyan Chapel. In 
the 20TH CENTURY many 'slum' cottages  
were razed and 38 Council Houses were  
built. The first four, Saxons' Close,  
were built in 1937 by Sir Stafford     
Cripps in vernacular materials to a    
good design by architect Morley Horder-
the first council houses listed for    
their social and historical importance.</content>
