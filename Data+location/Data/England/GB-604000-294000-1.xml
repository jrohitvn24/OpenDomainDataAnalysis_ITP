		<title>01 ATTLEBOROUGH</title>
		<content>  ATTLEBOROUGH(Population 6406) is     
situated 15 miles SW of Norwich on the 
A11.It provides a comprehensive range  
of amenities and services for those    
living in this flourishing farming     
area.Recent excavations on the A11     
bypass revealed the existence of a     
Saxon highway which suggests that the  
town may date back to the Saxon or     
Roman period.Attleborough was a        
Market Town in 1285 and had a yearly   
fair granted in 1310.                  
  The Parish Church of St.Marys        
probably dates back to the Saxon period
and has a well preserved screen and    
some medieval wall paintings worthy of 
mention.                               
  The town became an actual staging    
post for coaches and one of the        
earliest turnpikes is recorded on a    
pillar(dated 1695) just North of the   
town on the A11.                       </content>
