		<content> There is one recreation ground to the 
 west of the town at Victoria Park. It 
 has a playground for younger children.
 In addition, it has a bowling green,  
 putting green, tennis court and a     
 large open space for occasional       
 cricket, football or rugby. There is  
 another area of recreation to the     
 south of the town at Cranley Gardens, 
 which has similar facilities.         
 The Docks area is now a Marina. It is 
 still being developed and the         
 buildings around consist of attractive
 brick built luxury houses,            
 apppartments and flats with private   
 moorings for pleasure boats.          
 The Bridgwater Arts Centre was the    
 first of its kind in the country and  
 presents plays, musical evenings and  
 varied entertainment for the town's   
 folk.
