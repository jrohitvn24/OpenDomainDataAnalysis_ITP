		<title>02WOODLAND TO HOUSING</title>
		<content> The area may be divided into two      
 parts_the valley bottom with its      
 springs and rivers and the            
 Ragstone slope running from N.W to    
 S.E.  Most arable farming is found in 
 the valley while the Ragstone slope   
 has always tended to be rocky and     
 covered with woodland. This rocky     
 substrate has often caused difficulty 
 for ploughing but modern machinery is 
 more capable of removing rocks that   
 would have broken many ploughs in the 
 past. Modern fertilisers have also    
 helped to make this region more       
 useable so that more of this area can 
 be cultivated. In the Kingswood       
 locality many acres of sweet chestnut 
 coppice have been removed and land    
 devoted to new housing estates. This  
 is due largely to the reduction of    
 Leeds Castle estate and to its        
 development potential.                </content>
