{ }Nearly all the farms in the area are
 large mixed farms. They have dairy    
 herds and provide most of their winter
 food. Most farmers also grow some root
 crops as well. Many of the farms are  
 recorded in the Domesday Book 1086.

 usual crops,it is a stable for horses.

 centre which transports its flowers by
