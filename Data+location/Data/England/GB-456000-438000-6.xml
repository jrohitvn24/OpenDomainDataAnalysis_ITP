		<content>  Milk is delivered door to door daily 
 by Northern Dairies, who also bring   
 bread, butter, cream, eggs and        
 potatoes.  There is a travelling shop 
 and a bread delivery service, and a   
 local woman cycles round morning and  
 evening delivering newspapers.  The   
 mobile library visits once a          
 fortnight.{                           
{ A building firm is based in Kelfield,
{and there is a self-employed          
{plasterer.  Three market gardeners and
{seven farms over a hundred acres are  
{in the parish.  Some pigeon fanciers, 
{and a professional hot air            
{balloonist/author live in the village.
{ A flood bank now protects the        
{village from flooding by the river    
{Ouse, but there are fears of          
{subsidence when coal mining in the    
{Selby coalfield gets underway. }
