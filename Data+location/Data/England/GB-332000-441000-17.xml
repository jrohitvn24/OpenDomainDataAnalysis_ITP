     TODAY MOST PEOPLE GO ABROAD FOR   
THEIR HOLIDAYS,USUALLY FOR WARM WEATHER
AND GOOD FOOD,BUT ENGLAND IS STILL A   
LOVELY PLACE TO GO FOR YOUR HOLIDAYS   
BUT WHEN YOU LIVE THERE YOU DON'T SEE  
IT AS A HOLIDAY BUT IT DOES HAVE NICE  
FOOD!IN THE FORTIES PEOPLE NEVER WENT  
ABROAD UNLESS THEY WERE VERY RICH.I GO 
TO PLACES IN EUROPE .I HAVE BEEN       
TO:FRANCE,SPAIN,GERMANY,NORWAY,AUSTRIA 
AND THIS AUGUST I AM GOING TO          
 ENMARK.PEOPLE IN THOSE TIMES WOULD NOT
GO TO SUCH PLACES.                     
     I LIKE TRAVELLING IN BOATS AND    
PLANES BUT NOT IN CARS.I AM VERY GLAD  
I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL       
ABROAD. I WONDER IF PEOPLE IN THE      
FUTURE WILL TRAVEL ABOUT THE SOLAR     
SYSTEM AS WE TRAVEL ABOUT THE WORLD.
