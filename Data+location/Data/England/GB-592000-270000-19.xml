		<title>19YOUNG PEOPLE (CONTINUED)</title>
		<content>Whereas at the beginning of the century
most people were born,lived and died in
the same village this is no longer so. 
With considerable unemployment (nearly 
4 million in the U.K.) people are      
forced to move where there is work.    
With bigger and more efficient         
machinery fewer and fewer men are      
needed to work the land.               
Children today expect their own bedroom
or to share with only one sibling.     
Another striking change has been in    
eating habits. No more is food cooked  
for hours on a fire. An hour or so on  
an electric or gas cooker, or a few    
minutes in a microwave oven is all that
is required. Sheep's heads, pigs feet  
and suet puddings are no longer in     
vogue- a world without beef-burgers,   
chips and fish-fingers is unimaginable.
We have moved from bottling and salting
food to preserving it in a freezer.    </content>
