    One person is 'it' and the rest    
 run around. If the person who is 'it' 
 tigs or touches one of the people     
 who are running around they have to   
 stand with their legs open and arms   
 out. If a free person goes through    
 that person's legs then they can run  
 around again with everyone else. The  
 game ends when everyone is standing   
 with their legs open and arms out.
