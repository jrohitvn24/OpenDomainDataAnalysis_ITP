		<content>  The original{Victorian building}now  
 houses three infant classes.The other 
{school buildings have all been added  
 over the years.Two classrooms,the hall
 and the dining hall were all built    
 after the war.Our toilet block is the 
 original building in the middle of the
 playground.The state of the buildings 
 is poor and it is recognised that we  
 need some form of remodelling.        
  The{staff}is made up of Head plus 9  
 class teachers;of these 3 are male.   
  The{children}come from the villages  
 of East and North Coker,Hardington,   
 East Chinnock,Pendomer,Halstock and   
 the outskirts of Yeovil.About 75      
 children come to school by{bus,}the   
 remainder either{walk}or are brought  
{by car.                               
  We have our own{school kitchen}which 
 provides meals for 170 children per   
 day.                                  </content>
