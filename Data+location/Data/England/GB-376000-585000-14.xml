		<title>14The Church</title>
		<content> The area is served by the Rector who  
 lives at Falstone and the             
 non-conformist minister residing in   
 Bellingham.  People attend church at  
 Falstone or Bellingham.  During the   
 summer month services have been held  
 in Thorneyborn culminating in the     
 Harvest Festival when the church was  
 full.  Both Greystead and Thorneyburn 
 were built to the same basic plan.    
 They are pleasant greystone buildings 
 with square towers.  Thorneyburn      
 contains some beautiful stained glass 
 and a set of kneelers worked by       
 parishioners to individual designs but
 to an overall colour scheme.          
 Churchgoes are presently trying to    
 decide what is best to be done with   
 two buildings and a dwindling         
 congregation.
