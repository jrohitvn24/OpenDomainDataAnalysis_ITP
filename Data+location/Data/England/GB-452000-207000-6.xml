		<content>{St Nicholas' Church.}                 
 This church is the oldest and biggest 
 church in our area. The earliest      
 record of it is 1122,but it is thought
 that it is a bit older than that. It  
 originally had 5 bells but now it has 
 6. The church is still being added to-
 a Vestry is the latest addition.

{The United Reformed Church.}          
 This was built in 1939, but its       
 congregation began their meetings 100 
 years ago. It has many clubs and      
 groups attached to it.                
{Vicar-Rev. Ewart.}                    
                                       
{St Michael and All Angels.}           
 Built only 30 years ago, this is a    
 modern church. It has one small bell  
 in a small tower.
