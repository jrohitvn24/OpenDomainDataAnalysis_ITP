 festivals.Fishlake Show  is held for  
 livestock and horsejumping            
 competitions.The show is combined with
 amusements and arts for young and old.
 Every year a garden party is held in  
 the vicarage.The main attraction is   
 the traditional maypole dancing.      
 Village children dress up in laced    
 clothes.At Jubilee a float travels    
 round the village.Children dress up in
 red white and blue uniforms.The float 
 is driven by a tractor.On the back of 
 the float is a band which plays a     
 selection of melodies.A wheelbarrow   
 race is also held every summer for    
 blind,deaf and dumb charities. Prizes 
 are awarded to the fastest and the    
 best decorated wheelbarrow.
