		<content> The name of the fishing club I belong 
 to is called The Evesham and District 
 Fishing Club.  We meet every Monday   
 night between half past five and six  
 o'clock when the draw is made and we  
 start fishing at half past six.       
 Sometimes the match is called off     
 because the river is too high.  I     
 somtimes go to Twyford Farm area to   
 practise for the National Team.  We   
 fish for Chubb, Dace, Roach or Bream  
 or even Minnows.  The bait we use is  
 mostly maggots, ground bait, castors  
 and hemp.  Children my age pay 50p and
 we have a contest.  We weigh all the  
 fish that we catch and if we win we   
 get some money, but you have to wait  
 until the end of the year when there  
 is a presentation.  We have to buy a  
 licence to be able to fish and this   
 costs us 2.
