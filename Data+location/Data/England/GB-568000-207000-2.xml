		<content>   The oldest part of the district is  
{Duke Street}where Georgian facades are
 still to be seen,though they now front
 shops and offices instead of houses.  
 Here too is the local{Railway Station,
 built in 1843 on a viaduct of eighteen
 brick arches, and now believed to     
 handle the highest percentage of daily
 commuters to{London}per head of       
 population in the country.            
   Nestling in the shadow of the       
 station and its attendant goods yard  
 are the{Marconi}and{Hoffmann}(now{    
{Ransome,Hoffmann and Pollard})        
 factories, the former excelling in the
 field of{radio}and{electronics}and    
 the latter a leader in the{Ball and   
{Roller Bearing}industry.Built around  
 the turn of the last century,these    
 establishments were to prove the focal
 point of the change of character of   
 the area from{rural to urban.         </content>
