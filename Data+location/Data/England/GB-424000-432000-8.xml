		<title>08LOCAL SHOPS WEST LEEDS,</title>
		<content> The newest shop on the parade is an   
 estate agent. It is also an area      
 office for the Leeds Permanent        
 Building Society. It opened seven     
 months ago and people find it         
 convenient to save their money here,  
 as there is no bank in the immediate  
 area. The office staff report         
 business as brisk, with semi-detached 
 houses the most popular on the market.
 A local couple have owned the         
 greengrocer's shop for the past four  
 years. As well as flowers, fruit and  
 vegetables, pet food and accessories  
 can be purchased here.Fresh produce is
 collected early each morning from the 
 market in Leeds, but bulky and        
 refrigerated goods are delivered by   
 lorry.                                
  Although these shops serve the       
 community they face competition from a
 local supermarket.                    </content>
