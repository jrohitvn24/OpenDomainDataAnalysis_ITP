		<title>01INTRODUCTION: WARLEY, ESSEX</title>
		<content> This block is centered on the village 
 of Great Warley, and nearly all of it 
 lies within London's{Green Belt,      
 subject to strict{planning controls.  
 Two main{radial routes to London,}the 
 A12 and A127, cross it, as does       
 London's Orbital Motorway, the{M25.}A 
 high proportion of the area is        
{farmland,}with several{woodlands.}The 
 north eastern part (Little Warley) is 
 an extension of Brentwood: here{Ford's
 are the major employer.{Commuting     
 to London is common. This survey      
 examines the Geology, Landscape, Soil,
 and Streams. It then looks at the     
 Natural Vegetation, Microclimate,     
 Crops grown now and the previous land 
 use. It then examines Employment,     
 Housing and Shopping patterns,        
 followed by a survey of Traffic and   
 Leisure Amenities, and concludes with 
 an analysis of Attitudes and Trends.  </content>
