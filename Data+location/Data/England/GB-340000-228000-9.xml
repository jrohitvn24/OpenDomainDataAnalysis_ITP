		<title>09FARMING - MILKING</title>
		<content> First the farmer has to take food into
 the loft. When it is time for{milking 
 he gets the cows into the parlour.    
 When the first lot of cows are in he  
 pulls the handle and some food comes  
 down into the bins. Then the cows can 
 eat while they are being milked. To   
 milk the cows a{cluster}is put on the 
 cows' udders. This is a tube with air 
 being sucked through. Once the        
 clusters are on, the milk will start  
 coming into the milking jars and then 
 into the tank. Once in the tank the   
 milk is stirred and cooled. A tanker  
 comes and takes the milk to a dried   
 milk factory near Leominster.         
 Afterwards all the milking apparatus  
 has to be{sterilised,}and the loft    
 refilled with food.                   
 Fewer dairy cows are now kept locally,
 because of the{EEC milk quota         
 regulations of 1983.                  </content>
