		<content> Certain brasses in Haccombe church    
 date back to 1586. The church also has
 some Flemish stained glass windows.   
 Haccombe church has no tower but it   
 does have the oldest church bell in   
 Devon. In the crypt there are a number
 of coffins containing members of the  
 Carew family. On 19th July l985 there 
 will be a special service at Haccombe 
 to remember the 400 anniversary of the
 sinking of the Mary Rose. Vice Admiral
 Sir George Carew was in charge of the 
 ship when it sank in the Solent in    
 1545. The three churches are now      
 united into one parish in charge of   
 one priest. The Rev. Southwood is     
 Rector of Combeinteignhead, vicar of  
 Stokeinteignhead and Archpriest of    
 Haccombe. He has a retired priest,    
 Rev. Shaw to help him with services.
