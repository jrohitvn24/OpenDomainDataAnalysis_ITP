		<content> There is no large single employer in  
 Bellerby. This is a rural area and the
 biggest group of people work on the   
 land.                                 
     Most of the people work out of    
 Bellerby because there are not a lot  
 of jobs. Most work in nearby Leyburn  
 or Richmond.
