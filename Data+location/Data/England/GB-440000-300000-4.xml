		<title>04CHURCH OF ALL SAINTS, CADEBY</title>
		<content> Social life in Cadeby, like that of   
 most small rural communities, is      
 centred around the church.            
 The 13th century Church of All Saints 
 provides for the usual spiritual needs
 of the area and can generally expect a
 congregation of 70-80 worshippers for 
 the more important religious          
 festivals.                            
 The church holds two whist drives per 
 month, a garden party in August and a 
 fireworks party in November, with all 
 proceeds helping towards the upkeep of
 the buildings and a contribution to   
 the Parish Share.                     
                                       
 The Church Hall is the only meeting   
 place in the village and is therefore 
 the venue for all indoor events.      
 Market Bosworth Rotary Club meet here 
 every Tuesday and the Cadeby Flower   
 Club uses the hall once a month.      </content>
