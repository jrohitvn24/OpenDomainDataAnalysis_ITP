		<title>18Children's favourite Pets.</title>
		<content>The most popular pets in our school are
birds chickens or budgerigars,the      
second fish,the third cats and the     
fourth dogs.We found this out} by,get- 
ting a graph of the Infants and        
Juniors pets.I think fish are popular  
because they cost less to keep.Horses  
are not very popular because they cost 
alot to keep.We have found out the cost
of all the pets in the School.The most 
expensive pet to keep is a horse,the   
least expensive pet is a fish.The horse
is the most expensive pet because you  
have to buy hay,straw,track,brushes,   
hoof oil,Black Smith's bills,vet bills 
and you have to buy land or rent it.   
People pay more for their pets today   
than they have ever before.Many people 
keep dogs as there are plenty of places
to walk dogs and they act as guards    
for the isolated houses.The most dog   
is the Labrador as a pet and gun-dog.  </content>
