		<content>  The main disadvantage of living in   
 this area is the lack of public       
 transport.Midland Fox ran a Saturday  
 service to Welford for a trial period 
 this has now ceased.The only buses    
 through the villages are those taking 
 pupils to school at Kibworth and      
 Market Harborough.Primary school      
 children travel by Smiths coach to    
 their swimming lessons in Market      
 Harborough.Other journeys are by      
 private car.No families are without   
 a car;over half own at least 2,some   
 own 3 or more.There are also tractors,
 vans and 2 or 3 motor bikes.          
  There are direct{rail links}to London
 and the north from Market Harborough  
 and Rugby.The nearest{airport}is at   
 Castle Donington.Mowsley has 1{public 
{telephone box}as has Laughton.Most    
 homes have a telephone,the exchange   
 being at Leicester.                   </content>
