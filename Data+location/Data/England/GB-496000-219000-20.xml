		<content>  The present school was built in 1952 
 and replaced the original 1867 or 1872
 building.  At present there are 52    
 children on roll.  There are two      
 full-time members of staff, Mr. H.    
 Garrod, the Head, and Mrs. P.         
 Budgell. The part-time teachers are   
 Mrs. J. Wood and Mrs. M. Lawson who   
 comes on Wednesday afternoons to teach
 Music.                                
 The school is divided into two        
 classes.  There are five classrooms.  
 One is used by Mrs. D. Bell, the      
 General Assistant.  Another is used by
 the Playgroup.  The Secretary is Mrs. 
 J. Lay.  School meals are delivered   
 from Lark Rise School. Most children  
 bring sandwiches.  The Governors meet 
 once a term.  There is an active      
 Parents' Association which raises     
 money and forges links between school 
 and home.                             </content>
