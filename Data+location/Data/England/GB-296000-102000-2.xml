		<title>02A diary of 29 June 1985.</title>
		<content> It was my sister's birthday and so we 
 went to open presents in our parents' 
 room. For our first{meal,}we had      
 breakfast. This consisted of toast, a 
 piece of bread placed under jets of   
 ignited gas. On toast was spread a    
 sticky substance called marmalade made
 from oranges. My{drink}was tea, whose 
 leaves originally came from India, and
 milk which comes from a cow. For      
 lunch, I ate chips, slices of potato  
 fried at a certain temperature in fat,
 corned beef salad cream and garlic    
 sausage. I read a newspaper which     
 contained printed words and pictures  
 of a variety of happenings before I   
 then cycled to school. A bicycle is a 
 simple method of{transport}consisting 
 of a metal frame, brakes, handlebars  
 and seat. Later I watched{television, 
 a box which displays pictures and     
 makes a sound.                        </content>
