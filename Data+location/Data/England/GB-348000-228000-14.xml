 Law and order is not much of a problem
 in the block and is limited mainly to 
 minor acts of vandalism and domestic  
 disputes. The representative of law   
 being a constable, living out side the
 area, occasionally assisted by a woman
 P.C. The constable uses a small car to
 cover the area. One of his tasks is   
 giving talks to children at tje       
 school, and also assisting with the   
 cycling proficiency tests.            
 The most evidenc of police in the area
 is due to road traffic accidents on   
 the main A49 trunk road.
