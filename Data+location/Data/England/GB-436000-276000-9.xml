		<title>09Murder Mile</title>
		<content>   Over a tunnel leading to Ivy Walk   
 runs a train track, known in Coventry 
 as 'Murder Mile'.                     
   A train driver was killed and many  
 have been injured by children and     
 teenagers throwing stones at trains.  
   One train driver who was injured    
 came to school to warn us about the   
 dangers of playing on the railway.    
 Train drivers have to wear special    
 caps with hard peaks to protect their 
 eyes from flying glass, and cabs are  
 fitted with a 'dead mans handle '     
 which stops the train if the driver   
 collapses.                            
   Sometimes teenagers put obstacles on
 the track which could derail the      
 train, so this summer the police have 
 a special 'Q' force which are on the  
 lookout for anyone who trespasses on  
 railway land endangering lives.
