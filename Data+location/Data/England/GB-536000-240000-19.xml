		<title>19INTERVIEWING AN OLD PERSON</title>
		<content> Royston used to have a big{market}and 
 now it has about 35 stalls.There used 
 to be a cinema opposite the{police    
{station}but it got burnt down.There is
 still a{cinema}in town which was at   
 one time a{bingo hall.}The style of   
{shops}has changed a lot.They used to  
 be houses with a front window display-
 ing the goods on sale,or some things  
 were hanging outside.Today they have a
 large glass front and are built just  
 as shops.The High Street used to have 
 cars going along it in both directions
 but{traffic}is much bigger and heavier
 now,and it is a one-way street.{Roads}
 were not tarmaced like today ,instead 
 they were cobbled and bumpy.The{swim- 
{ming pool}is quite new,and in the old 
 days there weren't Indian or Chinese  
 restaurants.The old Bassett's{sweet   
{factory}closed down,in its place      
 they have built a{supermarket.        </content>
