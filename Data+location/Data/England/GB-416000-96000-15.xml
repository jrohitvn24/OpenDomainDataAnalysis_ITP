		<title>15Bransgore Church</title>
		<content>    The ecclesiastical parish of       
 Bransgore was formed in 1875 from     
 those of Christchurch and Sopley.     
 Bransgore's church of St Mary the     
 Virgin had been erected in 1822 as a  
 chapel of ease. The perpendicular     
 font in the parish church is said to  
 have come from Christchurch.          
    The present vicar is the Reverend  
 P.C. Elkins. In the grounds around the
 church is the graveyard. Next door is 
 Bransgore Church of England school.
