		<content> Mostly stone built, Careby has nine   
 houses west of the railway, one being 
 an isolated brick one up the Holywell 
 road; another was converted from the  
 old school. Apart from a farm \km away
 to the north (now a private house),   
 the rest of the village (15 houses)   
 lies east of the line, down a quiet   
 lane leading to the church and river. 
  The newest building developments in  
 Careby are a garage beside the railway
 line, built to look like a private    
 house, and a large single-storey house
 converted from a square of red brick  
 farm buildings.                       
  Two cottages are empty and semi-     
 derelict. A similar row across the    
 river was recently renovated and made 
 into one house. The road used to      
 continue beyond them to Witham on the 
 Hill, but was reputedly closed off to 
 isolate Careby from the plague.       </content>
