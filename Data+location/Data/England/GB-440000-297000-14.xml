		<title>14Lodge Farm,Stoke Golding.</title>
		<content>  Lodge Farm covers 212 acres of land  
 and 13 acres are also rented. The     
 farmer employs 2 full time men to help
 him.                                  
  At the moment the farmer is in the   
 process of draining part of the land. 
  It is a typical farm of the area     
 ,except that there are no milking     
 cows.Instead  lodge farm concentrates 
 on breeding pigs.The largest pig on   
 the farm weighs 600lbs. The piglets   
 are not kept long on the farm but are 
 sold to a farm specializing in        
 fattening them.The pigs are kept      
 enclosed because they do not consume  
 as much food as if they were left     
 loose.                                
  The farmers biggest problem          
 concerning pests are rats,which are   
 kept under control by the council. _
