		<title>04Brackley - general survey</title>
		<content>   One afternoon we asked 22 people    
some questions about Brackley. Not     
everybody answered them all. Most of   
the people we asked were housewives    
doing their shopping or people who did 
not go to work.                        
   Lots of the people we asked thought 
that Brackley was very nice because of 
the local people's friendliness.       
   If someone were moving to Brackley  
they would need to know about shops and
schools. Most people thought that both 
of these were good. Some said that     
books for schools are not chosen very  
well. Some people said that upper      
schools are too big.                   
   We asked if there were enough jobs  
here. Two said there were enough for   
the size of Brackley but 17 said there 
were not. Everyone we asked said that  
there was too much traffic noise. It   
will be better when the by-pass comes. </content>
