   There are lots of ponds near here   
 where you can go fishing. Some of them
 are up on the hills. I have caught a  
 lot of fish there, especially perch.  
                                       
   I go to a fishing club called       
 Whitworth Valley Fishing Society. We  
 have a fishing match every month and a
 club meeting on the second Tuesday of 
 each month.                           
                                       
   The site of some of the local       
 disused quarries provides many        
 opportunities for rock climbing. One  
 of the best spots is a place called   
 Fox's Rocks. It is high and has a hard
 face for fastening rings into. It is  
 also dry so you can get some good     
 footholds.
