		<title>06Re-development of a house.</title>
		<content> Huskards is a large and impressive    
 house in Fryerning. It was originally 
 built in the eighteenth century with  
 later additions. It's grounds were    
 once far more extensive than they are 
 today; there is evidence of a small   
 moat. The house served at one stage   
 this century as an old peoples home   
 and was once destroyed by fire.       
                                       
 With few people wealthy enough to     
 undertake the rebuilding of the house 
 for single family occupancy a building
 firm converted the house into six     
 luxury apartments while maintaining   
 the external character of the         
 property.                             
                                       
 A typical apartment consists of a     
 lounge, dining room, kitchen, three   
 large bedrooms and two bathrooms.
