 Most of the people in Tadcaster work  
 at the breweries of which there are   
 three, Sam Smith's, John Smith's and  
 Bass Charrington. Quite a number also 
 find work in the shops and in the     
 pubs, of which there are thirteen. The
{unemployment}rate in Tadcaster is very
 low. There are only about one hundred 
 people unemployed. However, there is  
 much{community work}to be done and a  
 large number of elderly people needing
 care and attention. Much more could be
 done to create jobs like this.
