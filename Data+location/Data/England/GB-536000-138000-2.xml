		<title>02Farming-Imberhorne Farm 1</title>
		<content>{  Imberhorne Farm}is an{arable farm}to
 the west of East Grinstead.The farmer,
 Mr.Emmett owns five large fields and  
 two small fields which makes a total  
 of about{280 acres.}                  
   Some of the machinery on the farm is
 used all the year round like the      
 tractor which is a very strong        
 machine. The combine harvester is used
 to cut the corn and harvest it.Usually
 2.5 tonnes per acre or 7000 kilograms 
 per hectare is harvested. Due to the  
 weather this year Mr. Emmett's harvest
 has not been as good as most years.   
 The corn is thin instead of fat and he
 will not be able to sell so much      
 grain.                                
  The corn is kept in a kind of storage
 shed. The containers in which he keeps
 the grain are over 3 metres deep and  
 air is blown through to keep the corn 
 in good condition.                    </content>
