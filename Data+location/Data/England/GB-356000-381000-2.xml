		<content> Daresbury Hall House was built in 1748
 which was in the Georgian Period. It  
 was a family house owned by the       
 Greenall family for a time. The Hill  
 family was the last family to live    
 there. After that it was sold back to 
 Greenall Whitley in the early 1950's  
 but they did not live in it. In 1952  
 the Spastic Society formed with four  
 parents paying Â£5 each to the society.
 In 1957 the society bought it for     
 Â£5,000. In 1959 the first residents   
 came that were physically handicapped.
 One year later it was officially      
 opened. There are 52 residents and 75 
 members of staff. The residents do    
 weaving, basket work, gardening, art  
 and sporting activities. They         
 sometimes have to do Maths and English
 and can produce some good pictures. It
 costs Â£12,500 for each resident so a  
 lot of money has to be raised yearly. </content>
