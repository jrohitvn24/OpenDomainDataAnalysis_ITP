		<title>09Chew Stoke "Harvest Home"</title>
		<content> Whereas in the old days "Harvest Home"
 was celebrated at individual farms, in
 1985 it has become a village affair   
 run by a committee to raise funds for 
 various causes and local activities.  
 Started about 60 years ago, Chew Stoke
 Harvest Home has become a Flower,     
{Fruit and Vegetable Show}with various 
 competitions including{painting}and   
{photography,}well-supported and       
 becoming more popular. The{horse show}
 and{gymkhana}attracts many entries,   
 the{dog show}is popular and although  
 the fairground no longer operates,    
 there are plenty of amusements fot the
 children. Like all outdoor activities 
 it does depend on the weather for a   
 good fund raising result but even when
 the tents collapse all is not lost -  
 the show goes on, in the village hall 
 - disaster, as usual, bringing out the
 best in the community.                </content>
