		<content> This plantation covers 31 Hectares and
 is of 23 yr old Scots Pine &amp; Lodgepole
 Pine. There is a fine stone wall that 
 stands in very good condition in this 
 area. Here and there trees are        
 managing to establish themselves on   
 heaps of shale left from mine         
 workings. The former footpaths to the 
 quarry are now completely obliterated.
 When it is dry the access road is just
 passable by car through the locked    
 wicket gate in the SE corner. A water 
 collecting tank and pipeline for      
 Broomflat Farms lies within the       
 plantation. Within the plantation     
 there is also a 0.5 Hectare wedge-    
 shaped planting of Scots Pine in rank 
 heather and bilberry. It lies between 
 the Landrover track and the fence in  
 the NE corner. Roe deer are resident  
 here and there is a well-patronised   
 pheasant shoot.                       </content>
