		<title>04THE ANGLICAN CHURCH</title>
		<content>   The  church  of {St Paul} was  built
 as  a  chapel-of-ease  in  1890 at the
 expense  of  the  dowager  Duchess  of
 Northumberland.  Prior  to  this,  the
 Anglican  parishioners,  who  were    
 largely  employees  or  tenants of the
 Stanwick  Estate,  had  to  walk  to  
 Stanwick Church  some 1\ miles distant
 in order  to attend  Sunday  services.
 Today, only one Vicar is instituted to
 look after the parishes &amp; churches  of
 Aldbrough, Stanwick, Forcett  and East
 Layton.  He is assisted  on occasions,
 mainly by  retired clergy  such as the
 Rev. Canon T.A. Littleton  who  lives 
 locally. Rev. Keith  Atherley has just
 been inducted as Vicar and has come to
 live in the new Vicarage at Aldbrough.
 Prior  to  this,  previous  incumbents
 lived at Stanwick Vicarage. That house
 was sold at auction around  April this
 year.                                 </content>
