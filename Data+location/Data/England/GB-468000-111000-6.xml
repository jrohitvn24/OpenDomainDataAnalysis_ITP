		<content> Mr. Hignett, the Senior Veterinary    
 Officer, was interviewed by Hart Plain
 pupils.He told us that the P.D.S.A.   
 had been running since 1917 and was   
 founded by Maria Dickins. Nobody pays 
 the P.D.S.A. but only people who      
 cannot afford private vet services can
 come. There are some donation boxes   
 that ask you to please put in as much 
 as you feel is appropriate. They have 
 lots of drugs and medicines for all   
 the different diseases animals can    
 get. At the P.D.S.A. lots of          
 operations are done and they have lots
 to do because they have about 150     
 animals a day! There are two special  
 rooms for operations, one is the      
 theatre preparation room for the      
 animals to be checked and prepared    
 before they have an operation and the 
 other room is the actual theatre where
 the operations are done.              </content>
