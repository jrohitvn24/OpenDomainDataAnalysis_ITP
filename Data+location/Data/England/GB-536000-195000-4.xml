		<title>04Industry:Brimsdown 1</title>
		<content> Brimsdown has always been popular with
 industry, largely due to the good{    
{transport}facilities which have been a
 feature of the area.                  
 Many firms have been established here 
 for a long time,first using the{River 
{Lee Navigation}to bring in{barge loads
{of raw materials}and also to move{    
{manufactured goods to the  markets of 
{LONDON.} Later the{railway}provided a 
 means of moving goods quickly and     
 efficiently and the present day system
 of{motorways and arterial roads}which 
 serve the area has continued this     
 tradition. The range of goods being   
 produced is extremely diverse and     
 always has been.There are many        
 new,smaller industrial sites which are
 used as{warehousing and distribution  
{centres}and several large retail      
 trading outlets.
