		<content> Some farms are mostly grass.Turnips   
 and sugar beet are also grown.There   
 are many things about farming that    
 recur every year like harvest,seed-   
 time,lambing,dipping etc.The ground   
 must be fertilized regularly to keep  
 it in good condition.Some crops,such  
 as potatoes, have to be irrigated when
 the weather is dry.Insecticides are   
 used and  also fungicides to keep the 
 crops free from pests and diseases.   
 There are no pig farms in the area.   
 There are no dairy herds either.There 
 are some small areas of woodland which
 are used for timber,Christmas trees   
 and cover for wild life.Lots of farm  
 machinery is used.{Goughs}of{         
{Hunsingore }sell and repair it.There  
 is a {hunt}every year where fox hounds
 hunt for foxes.People on horses follow
 the hounds.The hunt meets at{Clock    
{Farm.}It is the York and Ainsty Hunt. </content>
