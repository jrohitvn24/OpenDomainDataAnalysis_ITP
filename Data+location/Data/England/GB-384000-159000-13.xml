		<title>13INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content>   This industrial estate is situated  
 on the north-east side of Trowbridge. 
 It was developed in the late 1960's on
 the site of the old brickworks. The   
 land here poorly drained clay and not 
 very productive from an agricultural  
 point of view. Development in this    
 area was basically that of            
 distributing industries and           
 warehouses, some of whom opened       
 distribution centres for the whole of 
 the south of England during the late  
 60's and early 70's. Volkswagen, one  
 of the largest companies involved,    
 later sold their premises to          
 Airsprung, a local bedding            
 manufacturer, who already had a large 
 site on the opposite side of the road.
 Today, this firm owns the largest area
 on the estate.
