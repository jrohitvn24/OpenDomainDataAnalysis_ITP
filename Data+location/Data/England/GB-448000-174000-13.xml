		<content> Lots of new houses have been built up 
 next to old houses which are a few    
 centuries old. These house many       
 families in them. Many old houses will
 be knocked down to make room for      
 estates. At least one estate was built
 next to a large field which must      
 pollute the crops to a large extent.  
   These houses are quite good because 
 they are built very quickly and are   
 designed for young married couples.   
 This has bought pubs, bus stops and a 
 garage to this area. The area has     
 virtually turned into a dormitory     
 town, a town housing people who       
 commute to large cities everyday. Many
 young couples move out of the area    
 when married, or soon after.
