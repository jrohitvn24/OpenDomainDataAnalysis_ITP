		<content> At present the A2 Trunk Road which    
 links Dover with London is being      
 reconstructed between Falconwood and  
 Eltham to make it up to a motorway    
 standard.It will open in 1987 and the 
 whole area will have a new traffic    
 system to prevent through journeys    
 along side roads.                     
 A lot of people are campaigning       
 against                               
 a new link road from the A2 across    
 Oxleas Wood,Woodlands Farm, Welling   
 and Plumstead,then across the Thames  
 on a new bridge.They say it would ruin
 the woods where there are many species
 of plants unique to the area,e.g.the  
 London service tree.Many houses will  
 have to be knocked down too.
