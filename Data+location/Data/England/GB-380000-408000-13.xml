{Gardner,}has been  working for fifteen
 years.                                
 His job is to walk around a certain   
 area making sure that people are      
 behaving properly. He is also there to
 help people who have problems, such as
 being lost.                           
{"The most serious crime in this area  
{is burglary," says Les,"but we like to
{think that we can prevent a lot more  
{crime these days thanks to our new    
{technology. I am in constant          
{communication with the police station 
{by walkie-talkie."                    
{P.C. Gardner's}"beat" covers about 5
