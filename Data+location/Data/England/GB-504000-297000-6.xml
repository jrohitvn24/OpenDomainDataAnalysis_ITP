		<title>06MIGRATION IN WANSFORD AREA</title>
		<content>  From our questionnaire we found that 
 26% had lived in the Wansford  area   
 for  less than five years, 18% for    
 between five and ten years, 8% for    
 between ten and twenty years and 36%  
 for more than twenty years.           
  The main reason why  the people      
 in the Wansford area moved there is   
 because they prefer the pleasant  and 
 quiet life of the village, a major    
 advantage of living in  the country.  
 They  said they prefered to live away 
 from a lot of people.                 
  The 14% who want to leave the        
 Wansford area wanted to leave because 
 there are no shops and hardly any     
 public transport services. They liked 
 the Wansford area because although it 
 seemed expensive it was quite close to
 Peterborough and Stamford which       
 provide the facilities and services   
 they need.                            </content>
