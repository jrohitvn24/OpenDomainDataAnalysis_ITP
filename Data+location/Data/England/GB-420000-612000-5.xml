		<title>05AMENITIES IN DENWICK VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Denwick would seem to have very few   
 amenities but this does not seem to   
 concern the people who live there. {  
{Mrs.Dixon has lived in the village for
{82 years.}She remembers a school but  
 says there is no need for one now with
 an ageing population and improved     
 transport.She and her neighbour,{     
{Mrs.Spratt,}rely on the mobile        
 shops,the grocer and baker who call   
 twice a week,the butcher who calls on 
 Saturday and the mobile library which 
 calls once a fortnight.They have to go
 into {Alnwick }to collect their       
 pensions,for other shopping or to     
 visit the doctor.They find the{2      
{hourly bus service}good but expensive 
 at 34p single as they remember when it
 was 1d.Most villagers would like some 
 form of street lighting and some      
 regret that the W.I.moved into        
 Alnwick.                              </content>
