		<content> There is a{Youth Club}in the          
 village which meets every Tuesday in  
 the village hall.There is also a      
 Womens Institute.There used to be a   
 lot of dances held in the hall but    
 these have declined in numbers in     
 recent years.                         
 The local{Public Houses}have become   
 the main meeting point of the         
 village.They have darts and dominoe   
 teams and both men and women can      
 play.                                 
 The{Chapel}in the village organises   
 many activities for the children.An   
 annual outing is also held and really 
 the chapel is the one thing in the    
 village that has not changed.         
 Every year there is a{clay pigeon}    
 shooting competition for the local    
 farmers which is usually followed by a
 barbecue.However they have not had a  
 barbecue for the last two years.      </content>
