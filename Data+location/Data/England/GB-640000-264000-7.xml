		<title>07TRANSPORT, THEBERTON</title>
		<content> A bus goes through Theberton thrice a 
 week and this gives patrons 3 hours in
 which to shop or make visits before   
 returning. The route is a B road which
 crosses the north east corner of teh  
 block and it is also served by another
 dual carriage road and a single track 
 road but in the main private cars are 
 used plus a few bicycles for getting  
 to work and shopping. The nearest     
 railway station is 3-5 miles away at  
 Saxmundham. Crossing part of the area 
 is the track for the London to        
 Lowestoft railway. In order to use    
 public transport, rail or bus, to the 
 nearby town of Ipswich or London it is
 necessary to take bus or train from   
 Saxmundham. Private cars are used for 
 most journeys.
