		<title>17YOXALL_HISTORY &amp; BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>  Yoxall began as a mediaeval "street" 
 village (buildings following the line 
 of the street).The street enters      
 Yoxall parish at the 14th C Yoxall    
 Bridge,continues along the line of    
 what is now Victoria St. and turns    
 left just before reaching the River   
 Swarbourn.There are 2 small village   
 greens _School Green and Goose Green. 
 Traces of the layout of the old open  
 field system of agriculture still     
 remain.The Moat,Town Hill is the site 
 of the old manor of Yoxall and still  
 has a deep dry moat.The present house 
 was built from the remains of an      
 earlier manor house and nearby water  
 mill which were demolished in 1897.   
 The first lord of the manor in 1086   
 was the Bishop of Chester, followed by
 the Ferrers family until 1265 and then
 by the Earls of Lancaster until       
 sometime prior to 1322.               </content>
