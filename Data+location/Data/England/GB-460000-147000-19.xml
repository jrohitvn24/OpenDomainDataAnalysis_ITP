		<content> In the villages of {Cliddesden} and { 
{Farleigh Wallop} there are not any    
 playgrounds because most of the       
 houses have large gardens. On the     
 Brighton Hill estate there are many   
 playgrounds as the houses have small  
 gardens.                              
    On Cliddesden Hill, next to the M3,
 is an adventure playground which has a
 bouncy bridge, two huge slides,       
 swings, climbing frames and a wooden  
 fort which is on the top of the hill. 
 It is exciting to play there.         
    Football, cricket and rugby are    
 played on the Common with walking and 
 jogging also popular as the           
 countryside is only five minutes walk 
 away. Other people pass their time in 
 one of the several allotment sites in 
 the area. Less energetic are visits to
 one of the three pubs or going to     
 meetings at the community centres.    </content>
