		<content>      {Traditional }Cotswold stone     
 houses which are located away from the
 built up area are especially sought   
 after and are thus particularly       
 expensive to purchase. As a result of 
 these present social trends the area  
 is becoming increasingly              
 "middle-class",and the settlements are
 said to be becoming {"gentrified".}The
 houses are thus occupied by people who
 have better paid jobs and can afford  
 at least one car to enable them to    
 commute to work.It is difficult for   
 young married couples to buy houses in
 this area.                            
        The{popualtion}has,however,    
 grown in recent years because of the  
 more {mobile executive type }moving   
 into the area with their families.The 
 growth of population reflects the     
 national trend of more rapid growth in
 villages located near to small towns. </content>
