Mr Max Wright began his company in his 
mother's hen shed 26 years ago. Today, 
he is chairman and managing director of
Max Wright Ltd. The firm makes oneÂ£off 
control machines which operate, for    
example, pumps or freezers. The actual 
components are sometimes supplied by   
the company ordering the device or they
instruct on the components to be used. 
Otherwise Max Wrights buy the          
components themselves and put the      
device together.                       
The company has supplied control panels
to many foreign countries; they have   
exported to Iran, South America,       
Belgium, the Falklands and the USA Army
stationed in Germany. The firm has     
tried to supply Libya but this order   
was frozen after the shooting of the   
WPC outside the Libyan Embassy in      
London. Permission has now been given  </content>
