		<title>16The Glassworks</title>
		<content>The glassworks in Tutbury were started 
originally by Webb Corbett.Tutbury     
Crystal started in 1980 when Webb      
Corbett closed down. most of the people
who work there now were employed by    
Webb Corbett.Some of the other workers 
set up another factory in the village  
called Georgian Crystal.There is little
difference between the old and new     
factories except they cannot use Webb  
Corbett designs.                       
Tutbury Crystal is on a much smaller   
scale than the old factory.Webb Corbett
employed 110 people whereas Tutbury    
Crystal employ just over 65.Georgian   
Crystal is in Silk Mill Lane where     
there used to be a Silk Mill.Their     
glass is the same as most companies    
except that they use lead as one of    
their ingredients so it is called real 
English glass.
