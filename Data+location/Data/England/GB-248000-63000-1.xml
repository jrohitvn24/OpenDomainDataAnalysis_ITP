		<content> Block 02480063 is seven miles North of
 Plymouth and at present is a sparsely 
 populated area, on the edge of the    
 Dartmoor National Park. The area      
 itself is of level farming land with  
 gentle hills with some small valleys. 
 It provides a good exanple of rural   
 life with all its advantages and      
 disadvantages. The main A386 passing  
 through the block links Plymouth to   
 Tavistock with minor roads tracks and 
 footpaths completing the links to     
 small farms and dwelling places.      
 Considering the outskirts of the major
 town are so close to this block it has
 seemingly failed to effect the        
 appearance of rural life. However     
 there are signs that the urban way of 
 life is slowly but surely creeping    
 into this rural scene.
