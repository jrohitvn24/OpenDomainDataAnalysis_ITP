		<title>12LEOMINSTER SPORTS CENTRE</title>
		<content> A sports hall is being built in{      
{Leominster}as part of the Minster     
 Secondary School Complex. Children at 
 the School will use the Centre during 
 the day and the general public will be
 able to use it in the evenings and at 
 weekends. It is thought that the hall 
 is the largest building to be         
 constructed in{Leominster}since the   
 Priory Church  900 years ago. The main
 hall itself is 39 metres long and 21  
 metres wide. In the main hall games   
 such as basketball, badminton,        
 six-a-side football, volleyball,      
 netball and hockey may be played. In  
 addition to the main hall there will  
 also be three squash courts and a     
 fitness room. The Centre will cost    
 Â£750,000 and should be completed by   
 September 1986.
