		<title>12THE HEDGEROWS</title>
		<content> In{Fenwick}nearly all the{hedgerows   
 have been taken down so the wheat has 
 a short stalk so it does not get      
 damaged by the strong winds. In the   
 other fields the wheat has a long     
 stalk because the hedgerows have not  
 been pulled out and they protect the  
 wheat. Where there are hedgerows you  
 find lots of wild flowers and animals 
 like poppies, nettles and rabbits,    
 foxes, moles and voles. The{winds}are 
 strong and thats why we may need      
 hedgerows. Farmers have hedgerows to  
 help separate field from field. Where 
 there are no hedges the fields are    
 large so the{machinery}can work       
 easily. The hedgerows that are left   
 are old and well established. In some 
 places the hedges have been{laid}in   
 the old fashion way.
