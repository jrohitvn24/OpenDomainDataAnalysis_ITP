 have this job he would like to be a   
 butcher. When Mr.Stockton has milked  
 his three different types cow all the 
 milk goes into a cooler tank. The milk
 is then treated by taking all of the  
 germs out. It is then put into bottles
 and{delivered to the public.          
  The style of the farm has changed    
 quite a lot, he used to have crops    
 growing, chickens breading but all he 
 has now is{many cows,}3 doves which   
 live up in the attic and some bulls   
 which live in the barn.
