		<title>08Winter in Sherford in 1985.</title>
		<content> Winter in Sherford is good fun because
 you can go sledging when it snows. One
 morning we had just got to school when
 it started to snow. We played in the  
 snow at "Breaktime" and tried to clear
 the playground. After dinner we went  
 home because the snow was getting deep
 and the buses wouldn't be able to get 
 up the road later. When we got home we
 went sledging. Most people did not    
 have sledges because it does not snow 
 very much here so they used plastic   
 bags which got very hot. All the      
 children in the village were sledging 
 in the same field. Some people were   
 having races. When we went over a bump
 on our sledge it broke so we had to   
 use plastic bags. I made a snowman for
 my baby brother, then we had a        
 snowball fight. It was good fun when  
 it snowed. Everyone in the village had
 fun and no one got stuck on the road. </content>
