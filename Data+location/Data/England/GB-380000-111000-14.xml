		<title>14CRAFTS IN SHILLINGSTONE</title>
		<content> There are several artists living in my
 village who are often found around the
 back lanes with palette and           
 canvas capturing our lovely           
 countryside scenes. We have a resident
 silversmith who makes the             
 most beautiful items.He is an elderly 
 gentleman and greatly admired.A group 
 of ladies have weaving looms and      
 produce patterned shawls. We have a   
 thriving patchwork and quilting       
 group who made a hand sewn quilt which
 was sold to raise money for the       
 school.There is a woodworker who makes
 children's toys,and a lady who makes  
 soft toys for all age groups.Another  
 group makes silk flowers.There are    
 potteries in two nearby villages.The  
 Shillingstone School Action Committee 
 organises a major Art and Craft       
 Exhibition annually at the School.
