		<title>12Life in Normanby</title>
		<content> We asked the population of our village
 how long they had lived there.Two     
 families had been in Normanby for less
 than a year but one person had lived  
 there for 50 years, another for 54    
 years and one for 72 years.More than  
 half of the families have lived in    
 Normanby for more than 5 years.One    
 family replied,"Our family has lived  
 here for hundreds of years". People   
 were asked why they liked living in   
 Normanby. Most people said that they  
 liked it because it was in the country
 and others remarked how peaceful it   
 was.One person said they thought it   
 was the best place in the world.When  
 we asked if there were any            
 disadvantages or any things people    
 disliked about living in Normanby most
 people replied no but a few people    
 mentioned the absence of shops and the
 heavy lorry traffic.                  </content>
