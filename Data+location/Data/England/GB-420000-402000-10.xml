		<content> well with the surrounding countryside.
                                       
 We measured the flow of the river in  
 the middle where it was quickest.  We 
 timed how long it took for a cork to  
 float 10 metres, and recorded three   
 timings. The average time was 2l      
 seconds to travel 10 metres.          
                                       
 We also worked out the size of the    
 stones in the river bed. The middle of
 the river bed was covered with large  
 stones whose average size was eighty- 
 eight and a half cms. At the edge of  
 the river the stones were very small  
 and averaged seven and a third cms.
