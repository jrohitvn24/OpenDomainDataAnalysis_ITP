		<content> In the morning we get up and have our 
 breakfast.After eating mum cleans up  
 and goes to work at Kings School.Then 
 my brother goes to work at the farm.  
       When mum comes home she starts  
 cooking our roast,which consists of   
 lamb,roast potatoes,boiled            
 potatoes,yorkshire pudding,peas and   
 carrots.For afters we have rhubarb    
 tart.                                 
      At about 12:30pm dad and I go to 
 the pub and return at 1:15pm ready for
 our dinner.We eat our dinner and after
 that we sit down and watch television.
      Later on mum goes out and does a 
 bit of gardening,while dad falls      
 asleep.At 5:30pm we have our tea and  
 after that we sit down and watch      
 television until 9:30pm when I go to  
 bed.                                  
    At 11:30pm mum and dad go to       
 bed,but my brother stays at the farm. </content>
