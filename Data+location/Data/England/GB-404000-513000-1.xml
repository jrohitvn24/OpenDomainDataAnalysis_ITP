		<content>    Our area is mainly                 
 country-side.Running through some     
 beautiful scenery is the River Tees   
 which has a public footpath along the 
 north side.There are a few{mills}along
 side the{river}and some are in ruins. 
 We have part of the A66 which is the  
 course of a Roman Road.There is a     
 caravan site opposite Barnard Castle  
 on the south side of the river.       
    A place worth a visit is{Egglestone
{Abbey.}There are exactly seventeen    
 farms and two churches in our area.   
    We have seven plantations and woods
 which have coniferous and             
 non-coniferous trees in them.The River
 Tees is a clean and unpolluted river. 
 There are six becks which flow into   
 the river.
