		<title>02Farming near Shipton</title>
		<content>    Shipton used to be quite a         
 self-supporting village with it's     
 Cobbler's shop, Blacksmith,           
 Wheelwright and its bakery back in the
 1920's when all the villagers lived   
 and worked locally . The majority of  
 the labourers were either shepherds,  
 herdsmen or grooms. There were also   
 general workers or day-men, employed  
 in thatching, ditching, hedging and   
 stone walling, so that as many as     
 twenty men were employed on one farm  
 alone.The highest wages for the       
 head-men being 10/- per week. Women   
 were employed on the farms in the     
 summer time,raking the hay, tying     
 sheaves and stooking them. Other jobs 
 for women were stone-picking, hoeing, 
 clearing the wheat fields of sheaves  
 and gleaning with the children after  
 the harvest had been collected.
