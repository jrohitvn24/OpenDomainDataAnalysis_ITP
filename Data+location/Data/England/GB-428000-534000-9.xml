		<content> The village is devided by the limits  
 of the D-Block,and much of the        
 industry has gone with it.            
                                       
 About 100 years ago Cornforth had a   
 thriving Pit which employed over      
 2,000 men. The Colliery was run down  
 and employment was found in the       
 quarries which surround the village.  
 The quarry stone is magnesium         
 limestone which is used in steel      
 making,and as aggragele for Motorways.
 The main quarry is owned by Steetley. 
                                       
 The orginal village was based upon the
 Green,a group of houses around a small
 grassed area with a road through the  
 middle.                               
                                       
 It is now the most popular place in   
 the village,and because the main road 
 goes around it,the Green is also very </content>
