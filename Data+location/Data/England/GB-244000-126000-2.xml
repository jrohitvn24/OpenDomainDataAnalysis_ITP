 THAT WAS WHEN BIDEFORD STARTED TO     
 EXPAND, &amp;{HOUSING ESTATES}OF DETACHED 
 SEMI_DETACHED, TERRACED HOUSES AND    
 MAISONNETTES BEGAN TO DEVELOP. LATER  
 FACTORIES{STARTED TO APPEAR,}eg.      
 A.M.P., ATLAS AND LEISURE INDUSTRIES, 
 MAINLY AT EAST-THE-WATER, WHERE THERE 
 IS NOW A THRIVING{INDUSTRIAL ESTATE.  
    ALTHOUGH{BIDEFORD}HAS EXPANDED     
 GREATLY SINCE THE END OF THE WAR, ONE 
 THING WHICH WE DID LOSE WAS THE{
