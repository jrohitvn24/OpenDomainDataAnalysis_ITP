		<content> The bus services to the villages are  
 run by Barton Transport, Midland Fox  
 and Lincolnshire Road Car Company.    
 There are 12 buses which go through   
 Frisby village each week-day,11 which 
 travel along the main A607 and 16 call
 at Kirby.The Sunday service is less   
 frequent,with no timetabled buses     
 going through the village.            
 In 1985, there are links with the     
 U.S.A.,through the Frisbie/Frisbee    
 Family Association _comprising of     
 members who can trace their family    
 name to that of villages named Frisby.
 Some of the disadvantages of village  
 life we discussed were the lack of    
 medical facilities,a play area and    
 large shops.Despite being surrounded  
 by fields,we are not allowed to play  
 in them.A car is almost essential to  
 take advantage of the amenities       
 offered by the nearby town of Melton. </content>
