		<title>01Watford: Location.</title>
		<content> Watford is the main town in South     
 West Hertfordshire. It is a mixture   
 of old and new building developments  
 with a mixture of indusrties.         
 It is situated in "Green Belt"        
 countryside and yet it is only 17     
 miles from the centre of London.      
 The M1 Motorway passes through the    
 outskirts of Watford, making good     
 road links with London and the North. 
 When the M25 Motorway is completed    
 it will also be quite close to        
 Watford.It is on a main line railway  
 and has a London Underground station. 
 There is a market 3 days a week and   
 the town centre has a large selection 
 of shops and several department       
 stores. The Grand Union Canal passes  
 right through Watford.
