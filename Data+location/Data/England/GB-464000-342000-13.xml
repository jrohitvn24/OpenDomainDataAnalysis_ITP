		<content>  Bulcote Farm is the largest farm in  
 our area.It was originally built at   
 the turn of the century as a breeding 
 centre for horses for Nottingham City 
 Corporation.                          
  The farm is 800 acres in size and it 
 runs from Stoke Bardolph to Gunthorpe 
 and along the River Trent to the      
 railway lines.The Severn Trent Water  
 Authority owns the land.The farm      
 is special because treated sewage is  
 pumped through pipes on to the fields 
 and used to fertilise the grass.      
  The farm mostly grows grass,winter   
 wheat,winter barley and 280 acres of  
 maize to make into silage for the 485 
 cow dairy herd.It also has 80-90 acres
 of fodderbeet which is fed to the     
 cows in winter.
