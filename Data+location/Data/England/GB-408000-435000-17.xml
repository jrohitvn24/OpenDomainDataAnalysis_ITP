		<title>17FARMING AROUND SANDY LANE</title>
		<content> This is mainly a rural area, but only 
 grass is grown in the fields. The     
 weather and the soil are best suited  
 to grass. The farms are dairy farms.  
 In summer the grass is cut for hay and
 silage. Tractors pull muck spreaders, 
 cutters and machines which set the cut
 grass in rows and finally hay balers  
 or silage choppers which then feed the
 silage into a trailer.                
  At Stocka House Farm they keep 90    
 cows. The farm is run by the farmer   
 and his son. The herd graze in the    
 fields in summer. The cows are brought
 into a collecting yard at milking time
 and are then led, 10 at a time into   
 the milking parlour. Four suction cups
 are attached to the cows teats and the
 milk is pumped into a stainless steel 
 container. There is a large barn where
 the cows are kept in bad weather. A   
 few cattle are raised for beef.       </content>
