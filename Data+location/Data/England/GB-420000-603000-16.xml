		<title>16Warkworth Waterworks</title>
		<content> Warkworth Waterworks are situated by  
 the River Coquet and are operated by  
 the Northumbrian Water Authority. Ten 
 million gallons of water are extracted
 daily from the river.The water is     
 purified and distributed by the       
 Newcastle and Gateshead Water Company 
 to towns and villages throughout      
 Northumberland and Tyneside.Outside   
 the works there is an underground     
 reservoir,25 feet deep,where 50       
 million gallons of water are          
 held.Inside the works the whole       
 purifying  cycle is completed  by 9   
 men.Fluoride, allum and chlorine are  
 added to the water. The waterworks    
 incorporate a fishpass which enables  
 salmon and trout to pass up river.The 
 Northumberian Water Authority bailiffs
 use the pass to record the number of  
 fish in the Coquet.
