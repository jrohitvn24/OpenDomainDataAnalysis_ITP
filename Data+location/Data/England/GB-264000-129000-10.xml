		<content> Mrs Davey has lived in the village all
 her life.She has noticed quite a few  
 changes in her lifetime.              
 The most noticeable change has been   
 that new houses have been             
 built,including two by R.Davey her    
 son.                                  
 An old house has been converted into a
 Post Office in the last year.         
 The Church Tower is the only building 
 in it's original state.It was built in
 the 13th century while the rest of the
 church was burnt down and then rebuilt
 in the 16th century.                  
 A batch of new houses is going to     
 built behind the church which means a 
 number of old barns will need to be   
 demolished.                           
 The village hall was rebuilt some     
 years ago because it was also burnt   
 down.It is used for many village      
 gatherings.    Glen Davey             </content>
