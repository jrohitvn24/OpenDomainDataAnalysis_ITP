		<content>{Computer Concepts}began in 1982       
 and moved into Gaddesden Place in     
 1984. This was part of the Halsey     
 estate and is built in the{Palladian  
 style. As part of the planning        
 permission, the house had to be       
 restored. The company is owned by     
 a man who is only 25 years old.       
 The company employs twelve people     
 at present and hopes to increase to   
 sixteen. It makes programmes for the  
{BBC computer.}All the people apart    
 from two are under twenty six. None of
 the staff has any qualifications in   
 computing higher than "A" Level. Since
 the BBC computer is no longer made,   
 Computer Concepts will be programming 
 for a new computer after 1985. This   
 will be a computer which has the      
 ability to mimic the BBC. We use      
 several Computer Concepts programmes  
 at school.                            </content>
