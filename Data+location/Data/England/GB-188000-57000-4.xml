		<content> There is a small railway station at   
 St.Columb Road. Trains go on to the   
 end of the line at Newquay or back to 
 Par which is the junction where the   
 main line trains from London to       
 Penzance stop.In the winter there     
 are not many trains each day.There are
 more in the summer when the tourists  
 come.                                 
 There are bus services from Truro to  
 Newquay and Newquay to St.Austell.Not 
 many people use them because they cost
 too much.On Wednesdays and Saturdays  
 lots of people  go shopping in Truro  
 where there are big shops.They use    
 Harris'Coaches because it is much     
 cheaper.                              
 Most families have their own car      
 because without one it would be very  
 hard to get anywhere from Indian      
 Queens.
