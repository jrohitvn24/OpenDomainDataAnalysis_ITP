		<content> French skipping is played by many     
 girls at Painters Ash C.P. School.In  
 this game 2 girls stand facing each   
 other with a loop of elastic around   
 their ankles.A third girl does a      
 series of jumps in and out of the     
 loop.With her last jump she lands on  
 the elastic and shouts "on".She does  
 this 4 times and chants "England,     
 Scotland,Ireland,Wales".The elastic is
 then moved higher up the girls' legs  
 and so on until the third girl makes a
 mistake.Other children at the school  
 play Pom-Pom. The child who is "it"   
 closes their eyes and counts to 150 at
 the Pom-Pom post while the others     
 hide.That child then goes to look for 
 the others.They have to return to the 
 Pom-Pom post without being seen and   
 say"pom myself 1,2,3".But if the child
 who is"it"gets there first he says    
 "pom(your name)1,2,3"and you are out. </content>
