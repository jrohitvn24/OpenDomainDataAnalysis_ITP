 3.15 when he wearily demands food and 
 T.V...fairly easy requests.William's  
 principal leisure activity is swimming

 session.The daughter,Claire has a busy
 and long school day finishing at about
 6.30.She enjoys a variety of sporting 
 and musical pursuits in this time.    
     I usually return to surgery at

 operations and immunisations.Afternoon
 appointments are from 4pm.to 6pm.with 
 urgent cases seen after.Closing at    
 7pm.(postgraduate meetings permiting) 
 I go home.William is usually in bed.I 
 eat with my wife and Claire which is  
 often the first time to relax.        
 Everything stops for the 9 o'clock    
 News.
