		<content> Walsingham Estate Co., having taken   
 back the R.A.F. base at Egmere in     
 1946, dismantled and removed some     
 buildings so that several areas of    
 woodland could be planted. These      
{plantations}vary in size from one to  
 five acres. Some still retain the     
 names from the R.A.F. base. e.g.      
 Transport Plantation (still with a    
 lorry ramp and Dome training          
 building), Cinema Plantation and      
 W.A.A.F. Plantation. Most contain old 
 bomb shelters. Tall{Corsican Pine}and 
{Scots Pine}flourish between the brick 
 and concrete roads. Thinned, these    
 trees are now being felled to provide 
 timber for pulpwood and pallets. This 
 timber and some from deciduous trees  
 is sold to local merchants. Willow is 
 sent to make cricket bats and elm goes
 to a furniture factory.
