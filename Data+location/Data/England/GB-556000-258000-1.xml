		<content>    The area covered by our survey is  
 entirely rural, although the area is  
 dissected by the A11(T) and the A45(T)
 roads which join together in the      
 north (the effect of these roads on   
 people's lives and the landscape,     
 however, has been minimal).           
    There is no industrial development 
 and no amenities and in 1985 there are
 only twelve inhabited houses.         
    The entire area, excepting the     
 roads, is covered by two types of     
 farming:- arable and stud.            
    Until the late eighteenth century, 
 it was an area of open downlands and  
 formed part of Newmarket Heath.
