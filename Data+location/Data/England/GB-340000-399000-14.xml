		<title>14Grayson's farm</title>
		<content> In the area we visited we found two   
 unusual facts on the farmland.        
 On Grayson's farm Mr Grayson the      
 farmer said that he thought there was 
 a Napoleonic prison camp there. He    
 found chains that might have chained  
 them up at night. Mr Grayson was also 
 of the opinion that the bed of the    
 nearby stream had been built by the   
 French prisoners in the Napoleonic    
 wars. He has also had a shed which is 
 300 years old and was bombed in the   
 Second World war. While Mr Grayson was
 building an extension he found a wall 
 and a spit .The spit was underneath   
 the old fireplace and the well was    
 near by. This suggested that a house  
 stood on this sight for many years.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
