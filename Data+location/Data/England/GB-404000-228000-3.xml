		<title>03BUILDINGS, HAILES</title>
		<content> Most of the buildings are old and were
 built either to serve the needs of the
 agricultural community or the Church. 
 There are two manor houses,at Coscomb 
 and Farmcote.The oldest church is the 
 chapel of St.Faith's at Farmcote.     
 There is another church at Hailes     
 which was built shortly after the     
 Norman Conquest.Finally,there are the 
 remains of Hailes Abbey,at one time a 
 great centre of pilgrimage,until its  
 dissolution in 1539.
