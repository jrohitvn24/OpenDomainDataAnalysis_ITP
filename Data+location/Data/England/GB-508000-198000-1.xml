		<content>{The landscape of our block is about   
60% built up and 40% open space.}  The 
electrified main railway line from     
London to the NW runs partly through   
a tunnel.  The Grand Union Canal runs  
through Cassiobury Park to the W.      
Other examples of transport are        
Leavesden airport in the N and the new 
M25 London Orbital motorway crossing   
the Gade valley on a viaduct at present
being built.  Much of the housing      
around the station was built in the    
latter half of the C19th.  Most of the 
rest was built in the 1920s and 30s    
with some postwar infilling. {The major
industry is Rolls Royce engine works on
the airport.}  Odhams, the printers has
recently closed. There are a number of 
small industrial estates but housing   
dominates. Cassiobury Park is Watford's
major public open space.  {The         
population of the block is 30.000.}    </content>
