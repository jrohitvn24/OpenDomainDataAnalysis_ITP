		<content>  A questionaire was given to 39 people
at random in Morris Square.The results 
showed that out of the 39,20 lived in  
Wolstanton and 19 did not.Those who had
lived in Wolstanton had done so for an 
average of 25years.Only 10 out of these
people worked in the village.We also   
conted a survey in the school about    
parentsÂ£ jobs.If we just look at the   
mothers we find that 56 work full-time,
67 part-time and 67 do not work at all.
Taking all the parents into account;55 
work in factories,54 in offices,34 have
outside jobs,26 are self-employed and  
23 work in shops.Out of all these      
people at work,36 are working on       
shifts.
