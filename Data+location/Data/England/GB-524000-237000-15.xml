		<content> People are attracted to Ashwell by the
 old buildings and by the {medieval    
{graffitti} in the Church.They also    
 come for meat and bread or to shop in 
 the delicatessan.                     
 Two local pubs(the "{Bushel and       
{Strike"}and the{"Three Tuns"}have     
 gained a good reputation for their    
 restaurants.These{attract customers   
 from all over North Herts.,though     
 some people might say they were rather
 expensive and would only use them for 
 a{special occasion}like a family      
 celebration.                          
 A full meal in a restaurant like this 
 costs around Â£12 - Â£15 a person.Wine  
 or other drinks would add further to  
 the price.                            
 Lighter,cheaper salad or "ploughman's"
 lunch (cheese or cold meat pie,bread &amp;
 pickle) are popular at midday with    
 visitors and businessmen.             </content>
