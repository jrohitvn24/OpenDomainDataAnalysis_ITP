		<content>{TYPE OF FARMING AND FARMLAND          
   There are many farms in this        
 agricultural area with its rich,      
 medium to heavy loam soil. About      
 two-thirds is arable, mostly corn and 
 oil seed rape but also wheat, barley  
 and vegetables like potatoes. The rest
 is pasture land for grazing sheep and 
 cattle and grass crops for winter     
 feed.                                 
   The land has a natural drainage due 
 to the ridge and furrow system to take
 away excess water into brooks, but    
 some fields still get very wet at     
 times.It is mostly owned by Merton    
 College, Oxford, whose founder, Walter
 de Merton, purchased it in the 13th   
 century.                              
   Some local tenant farmers still     
 prefer the old clay drainage pipes to 
 the modern, cheaper, plastic ones     
 because they last longer.             </content>
