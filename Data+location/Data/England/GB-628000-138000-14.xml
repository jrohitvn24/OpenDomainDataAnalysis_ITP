		<title>14THE DOVER JETFOIL</title>
		<content> The "Prinses Stephanie" and the       
 "Princesse Clementine" are identical  
 Jetfoils produced by "Boeing" aircraft
 engineering.It was in April 1975 that 
 Boeing first made their Jetfoil       
 operational.                          
                                       
 They have a constant speed of 43 knots
 or 80km per hour,and even in rough    
 weather,a high degree of stability can
 be achieved. The Jetfoils are very    
 comfortable and fast.They do not      
 pollute the environment either.       
                                       
 There are horizontal foils which are  
 completely submerged while the hull is
 lifted clear of the water.The speed   
 needed to lift the hull is reached    
 after about two minutes.There are     
 movable flaps on the back edge of the 
 foils to ensure stability.These are   
 guided automatically.                 </content>
