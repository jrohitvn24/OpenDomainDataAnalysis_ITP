		<content> There are four farms in the area of   
 the survey. All the farms grow crops  
 mainly but all of them also keep some 
 animals such as pigs, cows and sheep. 
 Farming employs only a small number of
 people today as there has been a great
 amount of mechanisation over the last 
 twenty years. Several hedges have been
 removed also to make it easier to use 
 machinery.                            
 Sugar beet is an important crop to    
 most of the farmers, but we found that
 most of the farmers we talked to      
 disliked the high level of            
 mechanisatio which had to be used for 
 this type of crop and complained about
 the frequent breakdowns that had to be
 dealt with.
