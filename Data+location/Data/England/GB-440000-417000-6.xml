		<content> Purston Jaglin is a large mining      
 community which is based upon the     
 two nearby collieries of Ackton       
 Hall and Featherstone. Most of the    
 houses in the area are on council     
 estates although a few of them are    
 privately owned. The majority of the  
 houses are built of red brick and are 
 heated by solid fuel. The smoke from  
 the coal fires produces a gloomy      
 outlook to what is otherwise a        
 pleasant and friendly area.           
 Although the mining industry provides 
 most of the employment in the area,   
 there is also a large soft drinks     
 factory in the town which employs     
 approximately 80 people, mainly       
 female.
