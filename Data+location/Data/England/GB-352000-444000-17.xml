		<title>17ST.JOHN'S SCHOOL,CALDER VALE</title>
		<content> St.John's C.E.School was built in 1862
 next to the church at the top of      
 Church Wood.                          
 It cannot be reached directly from the
 village by car and many of the        
 children walk to school along a steep 
 path through the woods, which are     
 particularly attractive in Spring when
 the bluebells are in bloom.           
 Between 30-40 children aged between 5 
 and 11 attend the school. The majority
 of them live in the village but there 
 are many who come from outlying farms 
 up to 3.5 miles away.                 
 There are three rooms, one of which is
 used as a hall, and also a kitchen,   
 although the dinners are now sent from
 a larger school in Garstang.          
 We think it is a very busy and active 
 little school. For example we go out  
 on many visits in connection with our 
 school project work.                  </content>
