		<title>05MILLBROOK VILLAGE STUDY</title>
		<content> Millbrook is situated between         
 Stalybridge and Mossley.The           
 B1675,Huddersfield Road,runs through  
 the village and divides in into two   
 very different areas.On the east side 
 of the main road is a council estate  
 built in the 1950's.There are about   
 185 houses,the majority of which are  
 semi-detached and built out of        
 brick.At the time of this survey some 
 of the residents had bought their     
 houses-we counted twenty four.On the  
 west side of the road the houses are  
 much older,built during the last      
 century when the{mills}were working   
 cotton.There are about 150 of these   
 privately owned properties.Those      
 situated behind Huddersfield Road     
 still stand on the original cobbled   
 streets.The shops are on the main road
 and with the exception of the Post    
 Office are all on the east side.      </content>
