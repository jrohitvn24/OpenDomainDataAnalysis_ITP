		<content>    The school moved to its present    
 site over 100 years ago in 1876.      
 "We had a half day's holiday to carry 
 up the slates.Those slates! We        
 breathed on them to clean them and    
 wiped them without a rag."            
    The schoolroom was heated by a huge
 brick stove which was attended by the 
 headmaster. The youngest teacher had  
 to fill the inkwells on Monday        
 mornings. As there were six inkwells  
 in each desk, it took some time.      
    School life followed the same sort 
 of pattern over the next few years.   
 Attendance varied according to season,
 being influenced still by local labour
 demands, fairs, sickness and weather. 
    In the 1880's the wearing of blue  
 ribbon in buttonholes posed something 
 of a threat to discipline. "All       
 obliged" (to remove them) "but one    
 boy. I sent him home to have it done."</content>
