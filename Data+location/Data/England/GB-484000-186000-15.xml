		<content>{History of Marlow Bottom              
    Before World War II the valley was 
 mostly scrubland, open fields and     
 shacks. Most of the shacks were thrown
 up as holiday and weekend homes       
 belonging to people who lived and     
 worked in London. Most of these shacks
 were turned into houses, but a few    
 remained. The houses grew in number   
 based around one dirt track which is  
 now Marlow Bottom Road. (Tarmacadam   
 was only put down in 1970)            
                                       
    The pre-war residents didn't mind  
 the newcomers but they didn't want    
 street lights. Eventually the street  
 lights went up and{Marlow Bottom}took 
 on a new character.                   
                                       
    There are now about three thousand 
 houses when originally there were only
 about one hundred and fifty shacks.   </content>
