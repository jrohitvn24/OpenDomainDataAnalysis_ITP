 The town was stunned when its popular 
 soccer manager, Lou Macari was        
 suddenly dismissed. In just one year  
 he had injected enthusiasm and hope   
 for the future,and had begun to build 
 up an exciting team. Within days, by  
 public demand he was re-instated.     
 He said"I wish it had never happened  
 but it is good to know that a stranger
 coming to this town can have so many  
 friends".                             
 The club is also in financial trouble 
 over rent arrears owing on the stand  
 which was built in 1973 when the club 
 was in the Second division. An appeal 
 has been set up and a deal is being   
 negotiated with the local Council.
