		<title>15BIOGRAPHY; PAUL SHANE</title>
		<content> The most{famous person}living in      
{Thrybergh}is the{television star}of   
{Hi-de-Hi, Paul Shane.}Before his      
 television success Paul had made a    
 name for himself as a{comedian}in the 
{local clubs.}He told us he was born in
{Thrybergh}and lived there until he was
 five. Then he moved to{Dalton.}There  
 he had lived nearly all his life until
 he met his wife,{Dorothy.}When he     
 married he had wanted a house in the  
 country but his wife had wanted to    
 stay near{Thrybergh,}so they picked a 
 house near a school. Later on as      
 Paul's family grew, this house became 
 too small and so they moved to their  
 present home, a new house opposite    
 Thrybergh Comprehensive School. It    
 was here that his daughters were      
 educated.
