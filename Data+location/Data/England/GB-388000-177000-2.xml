		<content> There are a couple of very large      
 houses, one of them is{the Manor.}It  
 has 24 rooms and has a lot of land    
 surrounding it (about 4 acres). In    
 that land is a swimming pool, quite a 
 few garages and lots of woodland. The 
 only disadvantage is that it has no   
 heating. Next door to the Manor is{the
{Court.}It too has lots of land (about 
 6 acres). About 1967 it was split up  
 into 4 different parts. The main part 
 has recently been modernised and sold 
 for Â£150,000. Both buildings are close
 to{the Church.}About 150 metres away  
 is Bouverie Park. There are 17 houses 
 in{Bouverie Park,}even though it goes 
 up to 18. The reason for that is that 
 the builder forgot number 13. Each    
 house is worth about Â£72,000.
