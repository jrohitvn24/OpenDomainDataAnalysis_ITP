		<title>20The Game of Marbles</title>
		<content> To play marbles you need some little  
 round glass balls, about 1.5cm in     
 diameter. The game can be played      
 between two or three children. Some   
 only play against their friends. Most 
 marbles are coloured with 1, 2 or 3   
 colours. Some children think that the 
 brightly coloured ones are more       
 valuable. There are different games to
 play with marbles. In one game the    
 first player rolls the marble towards 
 a small hole, the other players do the
 same. The player whose marble is      
 nearest to the hole, or is in it,     
 thentakes another shot. And the game  
 continues. The object is for all the  
 players to get their marbles in the   
 hole. The last player to get a marble 
 in the hole is the winner, and the    
 prize is all the marbles in the hole.
