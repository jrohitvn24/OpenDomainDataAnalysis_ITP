		<content>   The Denton relief road is part of   
 the M67 which completes the motorway  
 radial route from the Manchester outer
 ring road to the Hyde by-pass.It's    
 western end will eventually connect   
 with the M66 Denton to Middleton      
 motorway.                             
   It was constructed in two sections  
 which met outside St.Anne's School,to 
 provide a free route through the      
 heavily built up centre of Denton to  
 carry the high volume of traffic which
 severely congested the east west      
 route.The eastern section began in    
 earnest in the summer of 1975 and the 
 motorway opened on 6th September 1981.
 The road system had needed improvment 
 for many years,so the Ministry of     
 Transport, asked Sir William Halcrow  
 and Partners to report on a route     
 selected  by the County Surveyor of   
 Cheshire.                             </content>
