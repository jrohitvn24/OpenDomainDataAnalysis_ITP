		<title>18TRANSPORT IN THE EGMERE AREA</title>
		<content> There are no{classified roads}in the  
 area, but it is traversed by two roads
 of reasonable standard. The road from 
 Fakenham to Wells, known locally as   
{the 'dry' road}(no pubs on this       
 route!), carries the bulk of heavy    
 traffic to Seaman's Mills and on to   
 Wells docks. The second goes from     
 Walsingham to South Creake through    
 Egmere.{Narrow and twisting country   
{lanes}give access to Quarles and      
 Waterden farms. A few{farm tracks     
 cross the area. There is virtually no 
 public transport. Only a{Community bus
 travels weekly to Creake and Fakenham.
 Nearly every family has a{car}and are 
 prepared to offer others transport.   
 Two men have motor cycles. Several    
 ladies and children have cycles to    
 visit the shops about two miles away. 
 Agricultural vehicles frequent these  
 roads.                                </content>
