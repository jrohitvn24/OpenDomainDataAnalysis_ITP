		<title>16    SQUIBB'S  FACTORY</title>
		<content>{Squibb's}is an American company       
 manufacturing drugs and medicines. The
 Moreton factory was opened in 1967 and
 the site was chosen because government
 help was available and communications 
 and the local work force was good.    
                                       
 It cost Â£2 million to build and is now
 worth Â£10 million. The factory has    
 been expanded 3 times and occupies 26 
 acres. It exports half of everything  
 it makes. 600 people are employed here
 half of which are men.                
                                       
 They make 40 different products and   
 send them to about 50 countries       
 including Saudi Arabia, China and     
 Australia.  Raw materials are bought  
 from other factories and made into    
 medicines such as antibiotics and     
 pills for lowering blood pressure.    
 They make 50 million pills a year.    </content>
