		<title>10HOUSING IN THE GRIN'TON AREA</title>
		<content>The area is of Outstanding Natural     
Beauty and consequently is an attrac-  
tive place to live,for local employ-   
ees,as well as residents commuting to  
nearby towns.There are controls on     
new building and restrictions on       
changes from agricultural to domestic  
use.Dwellings range mainly from 2      
to 4 bedroom types,mainly privately    
owned with only a small and reducing   
%age under Council ownership.Older     
cottages would have accommodated       
families dependant on farming and      
servicing the communities.The textile  
industry subsequently influenced the   
residential development between the    
wars.Estates of modern detached and    
semi-detached houses have been devel-  
oped in W.Bradford and Chatburn.Older  
property is invariably brought to      
modern standards.Often larger property 
is used as accom.for the elderly.      </content>
