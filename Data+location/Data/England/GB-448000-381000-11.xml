		<content>{Coal }is the essence of the community 
 of Kiveton.  The colliery was sunk in 
 1866 and the development of the       
 village followed.   At present 767 men
 are employed by the N.C.B.at the      
 colliery and {production}is a weekly  
 average of 8,000 tons per week.   The 
 chief {market} for the fuel is one of 
 the Trentside power stations.   A full
 train of forty wagons carrying a total
 of 1,000 tons can be loaded in one    
 hour.   A new drift mine into the     
 Clowne seam was begun in 1978 and     
 Kiveton is regarded as a 'long life   
 pit'.   Further expansion is expected 
 and the{mining future}seems assured   
 with the prospect of new seams being  
 opened.
