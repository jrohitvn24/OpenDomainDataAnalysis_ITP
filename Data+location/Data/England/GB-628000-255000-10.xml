and buses had solid tyres.There were   
four butchers, three fish and chip     
shops, in fact there were about eight  
food shops. 'As small boys we often    
jumped on the carrier at the back and  
get a lift down the road. An           
interesting point is that it used to   
take 55 minutes for a bus to get to    
Ipswich from Wickham before the war and
here we are in 1985 and it still takes 
the same time'. Mr. Taylor thought that
in the future there would be more      
houses built in Wickham and because    
petrol would become so expensive the   
people wouldn't be able to afford to go
out to the shops other than "Taylors   
of Wickham Market".
