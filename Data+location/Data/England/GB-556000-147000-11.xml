		<title>11R.E. IN N.TONBRIDGE SCHOOLS</title>
		<content>  We sent out questionnaires to 10     
 schools in the Tonbridge/Hildenborough
 area.We asked about the schools'      
 religious education and what part     
 religion plays there.On average there 
 are 2 scripture lessons per week in   
 each school;5 schools have scripture  
 exams for pupils.The average school   
 has 4 compulsory assemblies with no   
 voluntary extras.4 schools only (3    
 Church of England,the other Catholic) 
 follow a particular religion.The      
 pupils of 9 schools involve themselves
 in religious activities outside the   
 school,and the lives of most pupils   
 are affected by their religion.The    
 assemblies' form varies between one   
 led by by a pupil or group of pupils  
 with hymns,prayers,talks and readings 
 and one led by a visiting vicar,a     
 teacher or class taking weekly turns.
