		<title>01Burlton and low lying ground</title>
		<content> The overiding feature of the area is  
 its flatness, although there are two  
 areas of higher ground, Pelton Hill   
 (91 mtrs) and Myddle Hill.  There is  
 only one main centre of population,   
 Burlton, which has 89 people,other    
 people living in isolate farms and    
 cottages.  Farming accounts for most  
 of the land cover but only some of the
 population. The farms vary in size    
 from about 20 acres to about 400 acres
 The soil types vary from a small aea  
 of grade 2 to grade 4. Most soils ae  
 of the heavy clay type, while on the  
 lower lying ground peaty soils        
 Predominate, The large ares of clay   
 soils allow growing of either grass or
 winer sown cereals. The main livestock
 enterprise is dairy cattle, with some 
 sheep. There are also small wooded    
 areas, which add natural beauty to    
 the area.                             </content>
