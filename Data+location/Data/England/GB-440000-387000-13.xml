		<title>13CATCLIFFE FLASH - JUNE 1985</title>
		<content>{   Catcliffe Flash}has been a place   
 where it often floods. Water from the 
{River Rother}used to fill the{Flash}so
 much that the road to{Treeton}was     
 covered. The road has now been raised.
   {Catcliffe Flash}and land near-by   
 has been made into a{Nature Reserve.} 
 We sometimes walk from{school}to watch
 the{birds.}There are lots of different
{wild flowers}to see. We found some{   
{bladder campion and tufted vetch.}    
    We saw{mute swans}sitting on a nest
 and a mother{coot}swimming with her { 
{chicks.}The{tufted ducks}and{great    
{crested grebes}are great at{diving.}  
 The{swifts}come in{summer}and dart all
 over the place.{Mallard, teal, pochard
{and moorhens}nest here too.           
    A man collected us some{daphnia,}  
{Stuart}found a{water scorpion,}and{   
{Helen}caught a{damsel fly.}We brought 
 them safely back to school.           </content>
