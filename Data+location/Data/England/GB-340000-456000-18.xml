		<title>18LOCAL HISTORY/OVERTON</title>
		<content>The parish villages were named in the  
last Domesday survey:-they are Overton,
Middleton and Heysham.Only Sunderland  
Point was not named.The settlement     
there only developed at the time of    
LancasterÂ£s trade with the West Indies.
It is safe to assume that the Vikings  
sailed longships up the river Lune.Many
local places bear Viking names still:- 
Trumacar,Trailholme,and Trumley to name
a few.Overton church dates from Anglo- 
Saxon times,rebuilt @1152 and extended 
in 1733.In Anglo-Saxon times,grazing   
land was held in common,the village had
a Â£poundÂ£ in front of the present      
Â£Globe InnÂ£,and there was a village    
Â£mootÂ£.Until 1947 there was a smithy,  
next to Glebe Farm,one of the oldest   
houses in the village.Building still   
goes on at the foot of Hall Greaves.
