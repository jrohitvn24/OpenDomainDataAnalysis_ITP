		<title>13Farming around Grafham Water</title>
		<content>   When the area forming Grafham Water 
 was flooded a substantial amount of   
 farmland was lost. One farmhouse is   
 under the water as is one road. A new 
 farmhouse was built at the expense of 
 the water authority into which the    
 occupiers of the flooded farm moved.  
   There are three farms with land     
 adjacent to Grafham Water. Crops grown
 are wheat, barley and oilseed rape.   
   There is a poultry unit to the north
 of the reservoir.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
