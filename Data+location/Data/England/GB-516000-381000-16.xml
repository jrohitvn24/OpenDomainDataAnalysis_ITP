		<title>16MY DAY, EAST BARKWITH</title>
		<content>{8.00am. }I get up from a deep sleep,  
 walk out of the bed-room and stumble  
 downstairs. I jump down the last two  
 steps and end up in our kitchen. Dad  
 is putting his boots on and Mum is    
 packing our lunches. I plonk myself   
 down by the gas fire and warm myself  
 up. Dad finishes putting his boots on 
 and walks out saying,"Cheerio." "Bye,"
 Mum, Gavin and I say. After getting   
 warmed through by the fire, Gavin, my 
 younger brother, and I scamper        
 upstairs to get dressed.              
{8.15am.}After getting dressed, by     
 putting on my jeans and my blue       
 jumper, I charge downstairs and put my
 trainers on. After that I get washed  
 in Imperial Leather soap and go for a 
 breakfast of Shreddies, sugar and cool
 milk.
