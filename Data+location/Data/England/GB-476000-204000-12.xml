		<content> There is one school in the area.      
 Longwick Church of England Primary    
 School which takes over 200 pupils    
 from 5-12 years old.  There are seven 
 classes and nine teachers, some part  
 time, with two peripatetic music      
 teachers visiting each week.  School  
 lunches are cooked on the premises.   
 The hall has gymnastic equipment and a
 netball court, and the school adjoins 
 the village playing field.  Every year
 the top class puts on a musical show  
 and in summer the active P.T.A. holds 
 a fete in aid of the school, and on   
 Guy Fawkes night a large bonfire party
 is organized by them.                 
 The over l2's have to travel out of   
 the area for secondary schooling      
 taking a special school bus.
