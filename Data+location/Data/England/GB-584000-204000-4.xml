		<content>   Maldon is a busy town especially on 
 a Thursday-market day.One of the bus- 
 iest junctions is at the top of Market
 Hill where it joins the High Street.At
 this junction is an old building which
 was originally St Peters Church.Only  
 the tower is still standing.This dates
 from the thirteenth century and is    
 made from pebbles set in cement.The   
 nave of the church was rebuilt after  
 it had collapsed in 1665 and was then 
 used as a grammar school.             
   The building now houses 2 libraries.
 On the first floor is the Plume Libr- 
 ary so called after Thomas Plume  who 
 died in 1704 and left the town his    
 large book collection.It has about six
 thousand books-many of these are first
 editions.On the ground floor is the   
 Public Lending Library.Although small,
 it is well used and an important part 
 of town life.                         </content>
