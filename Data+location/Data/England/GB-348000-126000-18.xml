  Monteclefe Junior School was         
 originally built in 1851 and consisted
 of one large classroom.The dividing   
 partition was not built until 1871 and
 was built by Miss Anna Maria          
 Pinney,the sister of one of the major 
 landowners.                           
 There has been an Infant School since 
 1850..There are other records that    
 mention the Infant School being held  
 in a barn in 1862.The original Infant 
 School was probably a barn but was    
 re_built for the purpose.A new Infant 
 School was built in Etsome Terrace in 
 1966 for 100 children.In 1963         
 the Boys'Junior School and Monteclefe 
 Girls' School were amalgamated and    
 finally in 1964 resettled at          
 Monteclefe School which had been      
 partly rebuilt and re-modelled
