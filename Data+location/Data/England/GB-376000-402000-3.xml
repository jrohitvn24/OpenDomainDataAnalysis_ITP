		<title>03Pendlebury Landscape</title>
		<content>     A lot of the houses in{Pendlebury 
 have been built in the last fifty     
 years. There are not many old houses  
 because they have been knocked down   
 and new ones built. The old houses    
 were lived in by people who worked at 
{Pendlebury Colliery}or the{Acme mill,}
 when Pendlebury was a town by itself. 
 The colliery and the mill have both   
 been knocked down and Pendlebury is   
 part of{Salford}now.About half of the 
 houses are council owned and half are 
 private. Most are quite small with two
 or three bedrooms. There used to be a 
 huge house nearby called{Agecroft Hall
 but it was taken down and sent to     
{America}for somebody to live in. Now  
 there are no big houses here. A lot of
 small factories have been built in    
 Pendlebury, making things like        
{computers}and{stainless steel}        
 products.                             </content>
