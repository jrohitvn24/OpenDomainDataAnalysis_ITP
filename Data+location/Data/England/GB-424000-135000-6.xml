		<title>06Women's Institute</title>
		<content>     This Women's Institute was founded
 in I9I9.To_day it has 33 members, the 
 majority of whom are over the age of  
 50. Young village women are reluctant 
 to join as they feel the W.I. has a   
 dated image.Also educational classes  
 are readily available for crafts,     
 cookery,gardening, etc through the    
 Government subsidised adult education 
 W.I. classes are held in lampshade    
 making, breadmaking, and computers and
 others. Fund raising events  are held 
 each year for various charities ie the
 Guide dogs for the blind, Mentally    
 Handicapped children, and the Red     
 Cross. These include a Fashion Show,  
 Coffee mornings, Bring and Buy Stalls,
 and a Summer Fete. To_days W.I. is a  
 friendly monthly gathering, where     
 friendships can be made, new things   
 learned, and hopefully village life   
 enjoyed.                              </content>
