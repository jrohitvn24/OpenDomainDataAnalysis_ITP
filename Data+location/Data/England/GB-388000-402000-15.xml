		<title>15The Proposed Motorway</title>
		<content>   A motorway is going to be built in  
 1988. It will cut right through the   
 centre of Hollinwood. It is called the
 M66 extension, the Manchester Outer   
 Ring Road. Ten miles long, mainly     
 hidden in a cutting, it will stretch  
 from Denton, through Daisy Nook,      
 Hollinwood and Chadderton to the M62  
 at Heaton Park. It will cost Â£l56     
 million to build and will take over   
 three years to construct. We carried  
 out a survey of people's attitudes at 
 the local market. Most people thought 
 the Motorway was not necessary, saying
 it would be no use to them, but some  
 people think it is. Most people knew  
 about the motorway. Nobody said that  
 they were going to move house. A lot  
 of people think it will divide our    
 local community. Some 400 houses will 
 have to be demolished.
