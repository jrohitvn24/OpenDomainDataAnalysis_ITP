		<title>11The Sun Inn, Cottesmore</title>
		<content> When we went to Cottesmore Village to 
 sketch, quite a lot of people drew the
 Sun Inn. For example, Rachel Williams 
 did it and so did Ginny. The Sun Inn  
 has a very nice pattern on the top of 
 the thatched roof. That pattern is    
 called a scalloped pattern. In front  
 of the Sun Inn there are three wooden 
 tables and six benches, and a lot of  
 flowers.Across the road there is the  
 cottage that Mr. Williams drew. And   
 nearly next to it there is the one    
 that Simone drew.The first time that  
 we went to visit Cottesmore village   
 with our class(J.3.S) we had a drink  
 (orange squash) and some sweets       
 (Polos), outside of the Sun Inn,      
 sitting on the wooden benches.The Sun 
 Inn was built in the 17th and early   
 18th century They used to brew their  
 own beer behind the Inn.
