		<title>14THE MANOR HOUSE PROJECT</title>
		<content> THERE IS A DETACHED,SEVEN BEDROOM,    
 VICTORIAN RESIDENCE IN OLD HEXTHORPE  
 SITUATED NEAR A LOCAL BEAUTY SPOT     
 KNOWN AS 'THE DELL'.THIS HOUSE WAS    
 FORMERLY OWNED BY MRS EVELYN WOODHOUSE
 WHO RECENTLY DIED A MILLIONAIRE       
 SHORTLY BEFORE HER 100TH BIRTHDAY.SHE 
 HAD WANTED HER HOME TO BE USED FOR    
 SOME CARING/HEALING PURPOSE AND IT WAS
 DECIDED TO TRY TO RAISE THE MONEY TO  
 CONVERT THE NOW DILAPIDATED HOUSE,WITH
 ITS ONE AND A HALF ACRES OF GROUNDS   
 AND OUTBUILDINGS,INTO A CENTRE FOR    
 CHRISTIAN CARE AND HEALING.           
 IT IS HOPED THAT SOME PROVISION CAN BE
 MADE FOR THE DISABLED;THAT A SEMINAR  
 ROOM COULD ULTIMATELY BE MADE         
 AVAILABLE FOR THE USE OF LOCAL        
 CHRISTIAN CHURCHES AND GROUPS,AND THAT
 THE CENTRE COULD BE USED FOR RELIGIOUS
 AND SECULAR MEETINGS.
