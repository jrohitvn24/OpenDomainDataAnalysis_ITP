		<content>  AT THE EXTREME EASTERN EDGE OF THE   
 AREA, LIES THE INTERESTING VILLAGE OF 
{FARLEIGH HUNGERFORD.}IT IS CHIEFLY    
 KNOWN FOR ITS CASTLE RUINS AND ITS    
 RACING CIRCUIT, BOTH OF WHICH ARE     
 SITED OUTSIDE THE BLOCK, BUT THERE ARE
 BELIEVED TO BE TUNNELS CONNECTING THE 
 CASTLE TO THE CHURCH (SEE PAGE 14),   
 HINTON PRIORY (SEE PAGE 1) AND NORTON 
 ST. PHILIP, A NEIGHBOURING VILLAGE.   
  THERE IS A FARM NEAR THE CHURCH WHICH
 USED TO BE IN THE CASTLE, BUT IT WAS  
 MOVED OUT WHEN THE CASTLE WAS OPENED  
 TO THE PUBLIC. THE FARM HAS 200 HEAD  
 OF CATTLE AND GROWS OATS FOR A CEREAL 
 COMPANY. THE SURROUNDING AREA IS VERY 
 RURAL, WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF WILD      
 BIRDS, PLANTS AND INSECTS.            
  OPPOSITE THE CHURCH IS A ROW OF      
 COTTAGES, WHICH USED TO BE THE VILLAGE
 SCHOOL, AND A WATER TOWER AND PUMP,   
 WHICH SUPPLIED THE VILLAGE WITH WATER.</content>
