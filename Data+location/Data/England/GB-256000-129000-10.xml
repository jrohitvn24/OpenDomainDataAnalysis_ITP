		<title>10VENN QUARRY</title>
		<content> Mrs. Spear took us around Venn Quarry 
 in her car. We discovered how big the 
 quarry was; we hadn't realised before 
 how large it was but we soon found    
 out. Around the area there were lots  
 of farms and very few private houses. 
 We weren't able to go into the quarry 
 because the men were at work and it   
 would have been too dangerous. On the 
 way back we stopeed at Mrs. Spear's   
 farm and had a drink before returning 
 to school.
