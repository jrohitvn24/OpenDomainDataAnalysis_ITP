		<content>IT IS QUITE HILLY IN OUR AREA AND WE   
ALSO WENT OVER THREE HUMP BACK BRIDGES,
WHICH IS QUITE UNUSUAL.ONE OF THE      
BRIDGES GOES OVER A CANAL WHICH COMES  
FROM OXFORD.THE CANAL IS POPULAR WITH  
HOLIDAY MAKERS IN BARGES AND BOATS.    
THERE WAS A RIVER FLOWING UNDERNEATH   
THE SECOND BRIDGE.THE RIVER WAS RATHER 
MURKY I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T LIKE TO    
FALL IN!THE RIVER OCCASIONALLY FLOODS  
WHICH MEANS THE CROPS GROWN BY CHERWELL
VALLEY SILOS IN THIS AREA ARE LIMITED. 
THERE WAS A RAILWAY LINE TAKING PEOPLE 
FROM OXFORD TO BANBURY.OUR AREA IS     
MOSTLY COVERED BY GRAZING LAND,FOR COWS
AND SHEEP,AND FARMLAND WITH PLENTY OF  
TREES.THERE WERE QUITE A FEW FARMS,ONE 
EVEN HAS A LODGE.AS WE CARRIED ON      
THROUGH OUR AREA ALONG BUMPY ROADS,WE  
SAW ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE ROAD A
SMALL POSTBOX ON A WOODEN POST.
