		<content>    Although surrounded by larger towns
 eg. Birmingham &amp; Coventry, where      
 unemployment is a problem, most people
 in the area are in work.              
    The nature of employment ranges    
 through the spectrum from professional
 to unskilled labour. In our class     
 survey 25% of parents were self_      
 employed. 12% work in the area , the  
 rest commuting to other districts _   
 (25% to Birmingham.) Most female      
 employment is local enabling mothers  
 to be home for their children's return
 from school.                          
    Leisure time pursuits include      
 gardening, sport,needlecrafts of      
 various forms, D.I.Y. occupations,    
 radio &amp; television. All families have 
 one car, several have two. (This is   
 almost a necessity if peoples work or 
 interests necessitate leaving the     
 villages.)                            </content>
