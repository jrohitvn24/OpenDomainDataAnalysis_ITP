Each day at school we go out to play.  
In the playground a range of games take
place. We found that most of the       
younger boys and girls played with each
other whereas the older children played
with children of the same sex. The     
younger children acted out their       
favourite  television programmes such  
as the 'A Team' and 'Airwolf'. The     
older children played 'Tag' and 'Ticky 
Tunnels'. Some of the girls practisced 
gymnastics and the older boys played   
football pretending to be Liverpool    
players as this seemed to be the       
favourite team. There was some evidence
that traditional singing games were    
sometimes played and girls were seen   
skipping. Conkers were played in the   
autumn with a complicated set of rules.
