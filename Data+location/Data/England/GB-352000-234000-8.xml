		<content>{We liked Mr Wilcox.  }He was very     
 friendly and showed us everything,    
 even though we had only gone to see if
 he would help us.   He is{very        
{progressive}and tries to be right up  
 to date.   He is proud of the quality 
 of his work, and is{prepared to work  
{very hard.  }He and his men will work 
 7 days aweek if they have to, and are 
 quite prepared to work 15 hours a day 
 to get their orders filled.   Most of 
 his men were out fitting equipment in 
 a saw-mill when we went, but the ones 
 who were there were very nice to us.  
 They answered all our questions and   
 showed us their machines.   It was    
 very surprising to find such an       
{up-to-date firm}in really old         
 buildings in a little village like    
 Holme Lacy.
