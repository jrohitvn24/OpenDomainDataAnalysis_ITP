		<title>16LIFE IN A VILLAGE</title>
		<content> We wrote out a questionnaire for 17   
 school children of{West Stoke}and     
{Funtington.}From the replies we found 
 only 1 person was born in the village,
 nobody had parents born in the village
 and only 1 girl had a relative living 
 in the village.5 fathers worked in the
 village,and 4 of those worked on the  
 land.Most of the children go to       
 school by car and the rest by bus or  
 bicycle. Three quarters of the        
 children spend most of their spare    
 time in the  village, doing the same  
 things as us.They go to town quite    
 regularly and all but 2 have been to  
 London.No one  shopped locally, and   
 almost all of them liked living in a  
 village.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
