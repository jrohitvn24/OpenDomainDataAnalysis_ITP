		<title>11The Arts in Stowmarket.</title>
		<content>   The area can support only rare      
performances by professional artists   
and then only if simple facilities are 
needed. Amateurs use the old "Regal"   
cinema for plays; it also provides a   
setting for performances               
by the Schools Concert Band.  School   
and Church halls are used from time to 
time for musical or dramatic events.   
Enthusiasts are well served in Bury St.
Edmunds,Ipswich and Cambridge, for     
drama and  and music.  The rail-link   
with London is of great value to       
people interested in major Art         
exhibitions.        Library facilities 
used to be very cramped but the recent 
provision of a new building in the     
centre of Stowmarket has improved      
access to a wide range of literature.
