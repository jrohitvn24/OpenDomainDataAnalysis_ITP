		<title>13INDUSTRY - WASTE DISPOSAL</title>
		<content> At Low Dyke, the firm of H.&amp; E.Trotter
 contract to undertake disposal of     
 major quantities of industrial,       
 domestic, building and farming waste. 
 The field of the firm's operations    
 extends on a radius of some 30 miles  
 and more.                             
                                       
 Removal of waste is by means of skips 
 which are taken to site and left for  
 filling, and then lifted full and     
 brought back to Low Dyke. Disposal of 
 this waste is either by burning, scrap
 metal sale, or other means.           
                                       
 Farm slurry waste is removed to Low   
 Dyke from surrounding farms by means  
 of large slurry tankers, and the waste
 disposed of by approved means.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
