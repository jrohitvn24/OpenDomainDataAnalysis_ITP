		<title>06HOUSING IN HASTINGS</title>
		<content>  Housing in Hastings is of differing  
 styles of architecture.               
  The earliest housing is Tudor,       
 constructed from timber frames, wattle
 and daub, tiled roofs and latticed    
 windows. These are found in the Old   
 Town.                                 
  Later houses are brick, plastered    
 internally with slate roofs and larger
 windows. Georgian and Regency         
 buildings have simple elegant         
 proportions.                          
  Many Hastings buildings are Victorian
 and range from ornate mansions to     
 terraced cottages.                    
  Hastings has expanded in this        
 century.Many semi detached houses and 
 bungalows have been built more        
 suitable to the lifestyle of smaller  
 families than the larger Victorian    
 buildings. Many of these have been    
 turned into flats.                    </content>
