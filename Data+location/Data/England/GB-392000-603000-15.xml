		<content> To the West of our area is the        
 Otterburn and Redesdale Army Training 
 Area.                                 
    Its main use is for artillery      
 exercises, but is also used by the    
 infantry and for low flying aeroplane 
 exercises.The Belgian Army often uses 
 the Range and on other occasions, West
 Germans and Americans.                
   Many types of military vehicles pass
 through Harbottle, often in convoy.In 
 the main they are lorries and Land    
 Rovers, but we also see tanks and     
 scout cars.                           
   Helicopters are often used in       
 exercises and pass over the village,  
 sometimes carrying loads slung below  
 them.                                 
     Red flags are flown at the track  
 and road entrances to the Range to    
 warn of the danger when there is an   
 exercise in progress.                 </content>
