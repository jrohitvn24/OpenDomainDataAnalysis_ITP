 It was standing on a different site to
 where it is now.It was opened on 28th 
 June 1866, when there were only six   
 beds.By 1870 it had grown to 20 beds. 
  On 6th July 1872 the hospital was    
 moved to its present site.The hospital
 kept growing, more and more rooms were
 built.                                
  The hospital has had 17 Matrons since
 it opened.The one most remembered was 
 Mrs Lavington.She gave her services   
 free from 1919_1937.The hospital has  
 had many donations from the League of 
 Friends, and different charities.     
  The hospital is growing all the time,
 more wards and day-rooms are being    
 added and it is hoped that the old    
 nurses' home will be converted into   
 something useful.There is a great     
 community spirit within the hospital.
