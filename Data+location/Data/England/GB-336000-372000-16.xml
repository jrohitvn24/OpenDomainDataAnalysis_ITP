		<content> Mr.J.Wilson,a Parish Councillor for 25
 years,deals with local concerns and   
 helps the community run smoothly.Items
 discussed in Council include provision
 of parking at the Village Hall,street 
 lighting,speed restrictions,flooding  
 of the roads,litter &amp; house building  
 applications.Sometimes seemingly good 
 ideas may not be financially viable or
 not in the locality's best interests. 
 Eg.a bus service arranged but then not
 used &amp; a play area,under consideration
 might attract outsiders &amp; vandals.He's
 a local organiser for the National    
 Farmers' Union &amp; has been a Governor  
 of the village school for 15 years.Of 
 all these voluntary jobs the latter is
 his favourite as he attended it as a  
 child &amp; loves helping children.He says
 If you want to do something &amp; feel it 
 will help people,you can always find  
 the time.                             </content>
