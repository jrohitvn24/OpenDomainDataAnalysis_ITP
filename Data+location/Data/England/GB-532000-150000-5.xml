		<content> On the Green at Godstone is a pond    
 which has been there for about 150    
 years. There is also an old path where
 rope was twisted. The Green used to be
 a market where produce was sold. A    
 fair is held on the Green, a Soap-box 
 Derby and a Donkey Derby also.  Next  
 to the pavillion is a field roller    
 which is about 60 years old.There is a
 tennis club; they also play Cricket,  
 Bowling and Football. Near the Green  
 is a dairy where we can buy eggs,     
 cheese, butter and milk and on a      
 nearby bench, it says, "Silver Jubilee
 Tribute to the Queen Elizabeth 2nd,   
 June 7th, 1977." There is also a play 
 area for children.
