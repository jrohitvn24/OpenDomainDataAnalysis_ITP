		<title>06Deer of Cannock Chase.</title>
		<content>  There are 3 kinds of deer on the     
Chase, Red deer, Muntjac and Fallow    
deer.{The Fallow deer} are commonest,  
numbering about 300 in all. They       
are the most adaptable species and     
are able to thrive where other species 
cannot. Several{deer lawns} have been  
established on the Chase and deer may  
often be spotted near them.            
  Deer can be a nuisance sometimes,    
because they eat farmers' crops and go 
into gardens and do damage. They also  
eat tree shoots and foresters have     
to protect the young trees.            
  The rutting season, when the bucks   
may be heard calling, is in October.   
Fawns are born in June. At this        
time people must be especially careful 
about keeping their dogs on leads.     
  A small {Deer Museum} is situated at 
{Ladyhill near Rugeley.}
