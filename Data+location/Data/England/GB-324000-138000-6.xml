		<title>06Cannington Remembered</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mrs Krajniewski who is 
 Matthew Krajniewski's  granny. We     
 interviewed her to ask her some       
 questions about Cannington when she   
 was little . We asked her what sort of
 transport there used to be and she    
 said that there were a couple of      
 buses,horse and carts and mostly      
 walking. She told us that where       
 Kellands Agricultural Merchants       
 is there used to be a blacksmiths     
 shop.                                 
 Then we asked her what the            
 school was like. She said there were  
 about 50 people in the school and the 
 teachers were quite strict. She also  
 said if you got told off you would    
 get the cane on your hand never on    
 your bottom. Then she said that       
 infants used a pencil and the juniors 
 used a quill. She told us that the    
 school fields were allotments.        </content>
