		<content> Households with their own transport   
 prefer to buy their food and other    
 requirements more cheaply from        
 supermarkets in Diss or Lowestoft, the
 village shop tends to be used by those
 without transport or those wishing to 
 buy locally. The preserving of fruit &amp;
 vegetables has largrly been superceded
 by the deep freeze. Cooking is mainly 
 on electric stoves although some      
 prefer bottled gas or oil, solid fuel 
 or wood burning stoves. A few own     
 micro wave ovens. Meal times are      
 variable &amp; are mostly prepared by the 
 women.Houses are heated by            
 electricity, oil or solid fuel. There 
 are also some wood or straw burning   
 heaters &amp; many still enjoy an open    
 fire. Although there is no mains      
 drainage nearly all houses have indoor
 toilets &amp; their own septic tank.Most  
 households own a washing machine.     </content>
