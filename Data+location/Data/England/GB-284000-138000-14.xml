		<title>14Exford Youth Club</title>
		<content> Lots of children go to Exford youth   
 club which is held in the village     
 hall.Mr.and Mrs. Woolf are the club   
 leaders but sometimes three other     
 people come to help.It is 15p to get  
 in for one night.The young children   
 stay from half past six until eight or
 half past eight,but the older ones    
 often stay from eight until nine.At   
 youth club we play games like         
 dodgeball,British bull dog and Table  
 tennis.When we have played a lot of   
 games we have tuck which is normally  
 sweets and sometimes we have drinks.  
 Each year we have to pay Â£1 to say we 
 are still a member of youth club.We   
 start at seven or eight yrs old and   
 finish at seventeen or eighteen.      
 Sometimes we go down on to the green  
 and play Rounders.We all enjoy Youth  
 club very much.
