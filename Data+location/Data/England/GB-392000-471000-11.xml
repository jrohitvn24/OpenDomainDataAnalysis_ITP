		<title>11FARMING IN LITTONDALE</title>
		<content>   Most farming in the Dale is hill    
 farming.  All the farmers have sheep, 
 but some have cattle which they raise 
 for beef, or as heifer rearing for    
 dairy farmers elsewhere.  In          
 Littondale only three farms supply    
 milk.  Each farm has parcels of land  
 in different places, so that each has 
 meadow, pasture and rough grazing.    
 Only one of the farms is ring-fenced. 
   Swaldale and Dalesbred sheep are the
 typical breeds here.  Some are crossed
 with Leicester and Masham tups.   The 
 tups are put to the ewes in late      
 October or November.  Lambing takes   
 place from late March until May.  The 
 sheep are clipped in late June, and   
 the main dipping takes place in       
 October.  Silage making starts in late
 June, and hay-making in July.  Because
 of the long winter, cattle are kept   
 inside from mid-November till May.    </content>
