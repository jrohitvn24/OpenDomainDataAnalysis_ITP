		<title>09A KNOTTING FARMER (1)</title>
		<content>                                       
      Mr. Parrish, who lives at        
 Knotting in a 400 years old farmhouse,
 has two farms, this one and another in
 Dean.  In all he has l400 acres of    
 land, which are given over to mixed   
 arable farming.  Usually ll00 acres of
 wheat are grown, 200 acres of rape and
 l00 acres of grass, which are grazed  
 by some sheep, horses and recently 7  
 Highland cattle, because Mr. Parrish  
 feels that horses are poor grazers,   
 but sheep and Highland cattle are like
 "lawnmowers".                         
                                       
      In a good year, Mr. Parrish would
 expect to get 3 tons of wheat to the  
 acre and one and a half tons of       
 oil-seed rape to the acre.  Last year 
 he got Â£270 for each ton of rape, so  
 he thinks this is a good cash crop.
