		<content> Many farms in the area have cider     
 orchards. Two of the farms in the area
 produce their own cider.              
 At Northwood Farm, where Youngs and   
 Mills apples are grown from saplings, 
 they use a traditional wooden press   
 with stone supports. A cheese is made 
 with eight alternate layers of straw  
 and pulp. They put the cheese into the
 middle of the press which is five feet
 square and start pressing it. This    
 usually takes four hours. The cider   
 comes out through the bottom and into 
 a trough and finally goes into some   
 barrels or vats. They produce an      
 average of twenty barrels of scrumpy  
 per year. Each barrel holds           
 approximately 120 gallons.            
 At Woodlands House cider is made with 
 a hydraulic press.                    
 Some perry pear trees are also grown, 
 the fruit being used to make Babycham.</content>
