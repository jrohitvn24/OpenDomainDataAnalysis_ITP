		<title>09Dairy Farming in the Dale</title>
		<content>   Many farmers keep a dairy herd. In  
 winter they are kept in cubicles. In  
 summer they graze in the pastures. One
 farmer milks 12 cows. They are milked 
 twice a day and on average give 3     
 gallons of milk a day. The cows are   
 milked in either a byre or milking    
 parlour.{Electric machines}are used.  
   The cows are fed cow cake and they  
 start to let-down the milk when they  
 hear the rattle of the bucket.The     
 teat-cups or clusters guide the milk  
 into a unit.The milk then goes into a 
 stainless steel sterilized milk tank. 
 This has a milk cooler with  a        
 thermometer to ensure the correct     
 temperature.  The milk goes to the    
{milk marketing board.} A tanker which 
 holds 2,000 gallons takes the milk and
 transfers it to a tanker which holds  
 6,000 gallons the tanker takes the    
 milk to the dairy in Northallerton.   </content>
