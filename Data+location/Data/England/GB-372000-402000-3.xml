		<content> FASHION IN WALKDEN                    
 Today it's big and baggy.Big          
 shirts,small collars,jackets with     
 large lapels, brightly coloured floral
 designs and silky drop waist dresses  
 are the fashion. Pleated skirts and   
 famous name sportswear are known to be
 "with it". For hair perms and spikes  
 are in for both boys and girls. Jet   
 black or plum are the in hair dyes of 
 the moment. Pearls are best for       
 jewelry.Brooches are usually worn(in  
 place of a bow tie) at the top of the 
 shirt or on the lapel of the          
 jacket.This is because the shirts have
 very small collars.Skirts can be worn 
 any length but trousers and dungarees 
 are all worn 'cropped' as             
 cut_offs.Leather jackets and tight    
 mini_skirts are also in so is         
 body_popping and 'breaking'.
