		<content> There are not many facilities for     
 leisure activites for either young or 
 old people in this area with the      
 exception of the Avon Soaring Centre  
 and the Moyfield Riding School. The   
 Avon Soaring Centre is a thriving     
 Gliding Club in Bickmarsh which has   
 been in existence since l964.         
 Attracting visitors from all over the 
 country especially now that Gliding   
 competitions are held from this site. 
 The site occupies a very small area   
 approximately 500 metres by 50 metres 
 which is sufficient for powered       
 aeroplanes to tow gliders. This method
 of launching is the most efficient    
 means of running a successful gliding 
 club. In l985 the club has undergone  
 rapid expansion and many local people 
 are taking advantage of the facilities
 now available.                        
                                       </content>
