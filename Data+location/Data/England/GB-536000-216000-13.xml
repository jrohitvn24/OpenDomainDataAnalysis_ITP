		<title>13ST.JOHN'S CHURCH HIGH CROSS.</title>
		<content> The parish of High Cross was formed in
 1845 and the church of "St.John the   
 Evangelist" was built by the local    
 family of Giles-Puller (of Youngsbury)
 in 1847. Another local family;the     
 Martin-Leakes' (of Marshalls);are also
 important names in its history.Since  
 1847 there have been 15 vicars.The    
 church has 1 aisle and an arched      
 arcade.There are many stained glass   
 windows,2 of which are dedicated to   
 the Martin-Leake family.A white ensign
 flag from the 1st World War (in which 
 25 villagers died) hangs in the nave.A
 new electronic organ has just been    
 installed to replace the original pipe
 organ.Outside the church is the grave 
 of Arthur Martin-Leake,who earned the 
 V.C. both in the Boer and 1st World   
 wars.The church has a "family area",  
 where people can meet after services. 
 It is well cared for and clean.       </content>
