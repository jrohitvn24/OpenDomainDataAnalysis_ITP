		<content>     Each  year  about  65,000 visitors
 include 350 school parties with 12,000
 children. This 20% reflects an obvious
{educational value  and the wide  range
{of the  childrens' worksheets etc. and
{facilities for talks and guided  tours
{is steadily expanding.}To protect both
 the historic remains  and the tranquil
 atmosphere school parties  get  strict
 instructions  to  keep  their picnics,
 noise and rubbish in their coaches.   
     In the future if the water  supply
 can  be improved  a  small  tea garden
 might be built above the site. {Rather
{more expensive would be the excavation
{of the south wing.   This might reveal
{more about the trees and crops of that
{period  but in  particular the social/
{political   background   of  a  Romano
{British villa.}Near by,{Yanworth Villa
 has never been examined  and the{Roman
{Temple}needs scientific investigation.</content>
