		<content> Elms Farm was a dairy farm that we    
 visited.There were just a hundred     
 cows.They give 300 gallons of milk a  
 day.We watched the cows being         
 milked.We saw the bull who was called 
 Leofric Donald.A calf had been born   
 two hours before we arrived.          
                          {Lucy.       
  On Wednesday we went to Elms         
 Farm.There are 250 acres.There is one 
 Hereford bull called Leofric Donald   
 and there are a hundred cows.Some of  
 the cows are black and white Fresians 
 and some them are brown Charolais.They
 give 300 gallons  of milk each day,   
 which is 2,400 bottles of milk. {Kym. 
                                       
 When the boy cows are three years old 
 they go to the butcher.The bull stays 
 otherwise there would be no babies.The
 women are lucky.They go for milk.
