		<title>09A Family Sunday</title>
		<content> My family is my mum, Pauline, my dad  
 David, my younger brother Guy and     
 myself, Joanne.I get up at 8.30, get  
 dressed, washed and have breakfast of 
 cereals. After Guy has had breakfast  
 and our animals have been fed, we both
 watch television. My friends call for 
 me to take our dogs for a walk. Guy   
 goes to his friend Antonys across the 
 valley. Mum and dad are usually up now
 but if dads been working all night he 
 stays in bed. Mum does house work     
 while I play out. This is more or less
 what we do all day except I come home 
 for dinner and Guy stays at           
 Antonys. For Sunday tea we usually    
 have a pudding of custard. In the     
 evening both guy and I shampoo our    
 hair. We clean our teeth and go to bed
 about 9pm we dont have supper because 
 we've had a big meal.
