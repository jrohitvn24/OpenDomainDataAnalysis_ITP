		<title>13SUTTON VENY INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>   There is a small Industrial Estate  
 on the edge of the village called     
 Pound Barton.There are about eight    
 different places on the estate        
 including a wine merchant,furniture   
 maker,farm supply firm and a repair   
 garage.                               
   The industrial estate is very new   
 and people were very worried when it  
 was being built because it might spoil
 a pretty village.The buildings are all
 quite low and trees and bushes have   
 been planted all around them.         
   Most of the people who work in the  
 estate live in Sutton Veny or some of 
 the villages which are close.
