		<title>16HUTTON MARR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The original school building shell can
 still be visited, lying beside a      
 footpath running West from the Penrith
 road, at a point some 1.5km South of  
 Hutton End.  Records indicate that the
 original school was provided by       
 Trustees in the early Eighteenth      
 Century, before the Church School     
 movement took place.                  
 The present school building, at Hutton
 End, was constructed, under the       
 provisions ofthe Trustees' successors,
 early in this Century.                
 The school and playing fields,        
 together with the use of the village  
 hall adjoining, have been the         
 beginning of wide horizons for very   
 many children for very many           
 generations.  As this Domesday Survey 
 is being conducted, the final closure 
 of the school has been fixed for 1985.
