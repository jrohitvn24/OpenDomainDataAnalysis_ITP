		<content> My house is a semi-detached in a quiet
 road.  We have a small garden with    
 flowers at the front and a larger     
 garden at the back with a swing.   We 
 have two dogs, called Bonnie and Pye, 
 a rabbit, and a guinea-pig called     
 Squeak.  Our kitchen has been extended
 to give us extra space like another   
 lounge.  We have a video-recorder and 
 a car and I have a bicycle.           
 My mum works in an office building and
 my dad is a prison officer.  My sister
 works as a secretary.   We have our   
 own bedrooms - mine is the biggest but
 is always a mess.   On Saturday my    
 sister goes to watch Liverpool F.C.   
 when they play at home.  I go to      
 guides on Fridays and to swimming on  
 a Tuesday in Deyes High School.
