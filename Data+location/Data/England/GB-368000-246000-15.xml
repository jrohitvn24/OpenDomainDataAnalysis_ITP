   The long distance is mainly{25 miles
{to 100 miles.} The{veterinary         
{inspections}are very strict and the   
 horse has to be very fit.  The speed  
 the horse goes at is{7 mph,}human     
 jogging speed.  They have to do the   
 set amount of distance in one day and 
 if the horse comes back with any      
 blemishes points are deducted.  If    
 their heart beat is more than a normal
 60/minute or their respiration more   
 than 6 breaths/minute, the horse is   
 disqualified.
