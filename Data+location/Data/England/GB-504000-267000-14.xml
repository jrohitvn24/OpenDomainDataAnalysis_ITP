		<content> There are 2 schools in Dean. Eileen   
 Wade is a state run Lower School which
 admits children full time at the      
 beginning of the term in which they   
 are 5 and mornings only the term      
 before that. The children leave at the
 end of the year they are to go to     
 Margaret Beaufort School in Riseley.  
 Eileen Wade belonged to one of the    
 main families in the village and gave 
 money for the school to be built 10   
 years ago. The school survived closure
 3 years ago and the numbers have now  
 increased to 33 children from a low of
 14. There is 1 full time and 1 part   
 time teacher.                         
 Dean Grange School is a fee paying    
 school which changed ownership and now
 has a new administrator. It appears   
 that the numbers will now increase    
 from the 40 this year. There are many 
 pupils boarding from overseas.        </content>
