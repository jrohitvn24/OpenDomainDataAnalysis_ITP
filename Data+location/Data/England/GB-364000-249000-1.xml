		<content> This is a rural area which includes   
 sections of four parishes, Avenbury,  
 Acton Beauchamp, Bishops Frome, and   
 Stanford Bishop.The adult population  
 consists of approximately 9l people   
 living in 43 houses. There are very   
 few young children but several        
 teenagers.  The area is situated in   
 pleasant, quiet surroundings, with    
 views of the Malvern Hills to the     
 east, with Bromyard Downs and Clee    
 Hill to the north.  There are several 
 large areas of woodland; many hedges  
 are made up of briars, hawthorn and   
 hazel.  Apart from Munderfield, which 
 is very small, there are no villages. 
 Further afield, but very accessible,  
 are the cities of Hereford to the     
 south-west and Worcester to the east. 
 There is virtually no industry in the 
 area.
