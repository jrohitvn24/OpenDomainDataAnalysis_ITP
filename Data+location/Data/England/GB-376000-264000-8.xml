		<title>08WITLEY COURT CHARITY BALL</title>
		<content> Partygoers from around the world flew 
 into the county for a Â£27-a-head      
 costume charity ball at Great Witley  
 Court on July 6th 1985. Three hundred 
 jetsetters from United States, France,
 Belgium and Germany danced the night  
 away under marquees in the grounds of 
 the ruined stately home.The ball was  
 held to raise money for the           
 restoration of Great Witley's unique  
 baroque chapel.Guests, who looked as  
 though they were straight from        
 Gainsborough portraits or the         
 ballrooms of Versailles, dressed in   
 vast powdered wigs and flowing        
 dresses.They drank champagne by the   
 great fountain in front of the house  
 and danced until the dawn peered      
 through the ruined windows of the     
 stately mansion.
