 thus:                                 
 "Mother then has her lunch and does   
 the housework.                        
   Heather gets back from school at 5  
 p.m.,I somewhat earlier.My father gets
 home about 5.30,and then tea is       
 served.After tea without exception,I  
 wash up and make everybody a cup of   
 coffee.Everybody then relaxes,and     
 later my sister and I go out to see   
 some friends,and have a laugh playing 
 cricket or some other pastime.Our prep
 is usually done as soon as we get home
 from school,or just after tea.During  
 the evening dad helps mum with the    
 horses and then,after a               
 snack,I eventually go to bed.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
