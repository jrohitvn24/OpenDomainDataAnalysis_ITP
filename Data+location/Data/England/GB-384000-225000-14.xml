		<content>   A travelling library run by the     
 Gloucestershire County Council also   
 serves the area. We also saw a bakers 
 van delivering bread and cakes.       
 There are no schools in Lower Apperley
 and all the children go to Deerhurst  
 Primary School in Apperley or to      
 Tewkesbury to a Primary school or the 
 Comprehensive school on the edge of   
 the town 7 kilometres away. There is a
 park and a recreation field together  
 with tennis courts. Cricket and       
 Football are regular village          
 activities.                           
 Most people rely on Tewkesbury for    
 services such as the Police, Fire     
 Service, Hospital, doctors, dentists, 
 petrol and shops.
