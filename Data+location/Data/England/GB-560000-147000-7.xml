		<title>07Converted Buildings</title>
		<content>  There are a lot of oast houses in our
 area.Some are being changed or have   
 already been changed into private     
 homes.However some of the oasts are   
 still used today for drying hops.     
  Other buildings undergoing conversion
 include stables,barns,offices,and even
 a chapel,a castle and a brewery.Most  
 of these places I have mentioned are  
 being converted into private houses.  
  Hop picking used to be very popular  
 in our area,so they had a lot of oast 
 houses.When hop picking became less   
 popular the oasts were converted into 
 private homes for people to live in.  
  The chapel has been changed into a   
 house.The brewery is being changed    
 into some flats.Hadlow Castle used to 
 be a folly ,but a man bought it and it
 is now used as a home.                
  Faulkners Farm is a good example of a
 converted oast and has six roundels.  </content>
