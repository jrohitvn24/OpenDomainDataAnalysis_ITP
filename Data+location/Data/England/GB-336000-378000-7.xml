		<content>    Many of the stained glass windows  
 in the church show scenes of the life 
 of Jesus.                             
    The{lectern}is in the form of an   
 eagle; it holds an open Bible so that 
 everyone is welcome to read the word  
 of God.                               
    There is now an{organ}in the church
 but before that there was an orchestra
 which played in a balcony above the   
 arch into the bapistry.               
    The vicar of the church has many   
 vestments which are kept in the       
 vestry. There are 4 special ones. A   
 red one for Autumn, a green one for   
 Spring, a purple one for up to        
 Christmas and a white one for Summer. 
    THere is also a 16th century oak   
 chest which once contained the Parish 
 Registers. This had two keys,one kept 
 by the vicar and one by a             
 churchwarden.                         </content>
