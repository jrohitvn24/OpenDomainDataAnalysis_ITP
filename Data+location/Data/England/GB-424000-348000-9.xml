		<title>09 THE CARSINGTON RESERVOIR</title>
		<content>  The two farms to be submerged and    
 part of the dam are in this block, the
 rest is in adjoining blocks.          
  Many local people were against the   
 building of the reservoir, and are now
 worried about its safety since the    
 collapse of the dam. Most feel that it
 should now be finished since so much  
 disruption has already been caused.   
  The dam will hold back the upper     
 waters of the River Henmore, here     
 called the Scow Brook, which will be  
 augmented by water pumped from the    
 River Derwent at Ambergate in times of
 plenty. When water is short, it will  
 be pumped back to the Derwent at      
 Ambergate to supplement supply.       
  At the moment investigations are     
 taking place into the cause of the dam
 collapse, and whether the project     
 should be continued.
