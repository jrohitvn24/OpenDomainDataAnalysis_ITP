		<content>  HINDHEAD RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION HAS   
 BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS  
 AND IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT LOCAL      
 POLITICAL COMMITTTEE BECAUSE PEOPLE   
 CAN DEBATE ABOUT THINGS HAPPENING IN  
 THE AREA IN WHICH THEY LIVE.          
  THE AIM OF THE ASSOCIATION IS TO     
 REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF THE LOCAL      
 RESIDENTS.                            
  TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION
 YOU HAVE TO PAY A SUBSCRIPTION OF Â£I  
 EACH YEAR. THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
 IS HELD EACH YEAR IN NOVEMBER, AND THE
 SECRETARY AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE    
 COMMITTEE MEET EVERY TWO MONTHS.      
   AT THE MOMENT ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES
 UNDER DEBATE IS THE SELLING OF LAND TO
 BUILDERS FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS,    
 SINCE SUCH DEVELOPMENTS AMOUNT TO     
 'INFILLING'. RESIDENTS WHO OPPOSE SUCH
 PLANS ARE ABLE TO GO TO THE RESIDENTS 
 ASSOCIATION FOR SUPPORT.              </content>
