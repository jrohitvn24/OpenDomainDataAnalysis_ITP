		<title>01Attitudes To Winsford.</title>
		<content> Our class did a survey to find out    
 what Winsford was like in {           
{1965,1945,1925 and 1905.}Each pupil   
 asked one person  various questions   
 about Winsford at these dates.        
 In our survey we found that every     
 person but one agreed that Winsford   
 was better 20,40 and 60 years ago     
 because today we have more            
 unemployment,more vandalism and the   
 people seemed more friendly then.     
 The main changes of Winsford over the 
 passing years have been. The building 
 of the Shopping Centre. The tearing   
 down of the old High Street, the      
 building of the duel carriage way and 
 the new housing estates. Other changes
 of Winsford are the closing down of   
 cinimars, and dance halls and the     
 death of our Salt Industry.           
 All believed the town would decline   
 further.                              </content>
