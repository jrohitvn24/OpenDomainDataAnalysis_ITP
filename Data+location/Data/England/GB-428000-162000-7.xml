		<content> Arable farming is the principal indus-
 try of the area which includes parts  
 of six estates; the largest,{Polesdon,
 has about 50% of the total acreage.   
 Once part of{Stype Estate,}the farm's 
 recent history reflects the changes   
 which have taken place in agriculture 
 here:{dairying}has been{abandoned}in  
 favour of cash crops like wheat,      
 barley, oilseed rape etc.{Professional
{farm management}has been employed to  
 achieve very high levels of producti- 
 vity through greater mechanisation,   
 the careful application of more       
 effective chemicals, and better use of
 staff and land resource planning.     
 Employment is 10% of what it was five 
 years ago with 2 skilled workers for  
 2,000 acres, and 2 Game Keepers       
 maintaining a shoot which produces    
 7,000+ pheasants annually for sale in 
 a London store, adding to farm income.</content>
