		<title>11Agriculture near Mexborough</title>
		<content> Farming in our area is mostly arable  
 "Arable" means crop farming. We have a
 few beef and dairy cattle and a few   
 sheep. We grow four crops down in the 
 Dearne valley: winter wheat, winter   
 barley, oil seed rape and potatoes. Up
 on the limestone ridge we have noticed
 two other crops: oats and turnips.    
 We think the crops up on the ridge are
 different because of the limestone    
 under the soil which makes the soil   
 different.The crops in the valley grow
 in soil which is on the sandstone.Land
 has been reclaimed on an old pit tip  
 near our nature reserve.It is now used
 for sheep grazing.New trees have also 
 been planted on it.On all the old maps
 it said that the land near the river  
 was liable to flood but now that the  
 land has been drained by the new cut  
 of the Dearne,crops are now able to be
 grown in the land that is drained.    </content>
