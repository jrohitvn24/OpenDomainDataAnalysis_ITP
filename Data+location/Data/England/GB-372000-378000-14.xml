		<title>14TOURISM AT TATTON PARK</title>
		<content>   Within Knutsford we have a unique   
 park, called Tatton Park.  It attracts
 sixty two thousand tourists a year to 
 take in its many attractions.  These  
 include the two halls, the gardens    
 and the mere. Many sports take place  
 on the mere, like windsurfing, boat   
 and yacht sailing and fishing.        
 Exhibitions take place at the new hall
 yearly and these are very popular with
 tourists.                             
  There is the Cheshire Show that takes
 place annually and there is also the  
 Craft Fair in which people show off   
 their talents. TV's "Brideshead       
 Revisited" was made there.            
   Backing onto the house are Tatton's 
 famous gardens. In this garden        
 different countries are represented by
 typical buildings and plants from that
 country. Tatton Park attracts tourists
 from all over the world.              </content>
