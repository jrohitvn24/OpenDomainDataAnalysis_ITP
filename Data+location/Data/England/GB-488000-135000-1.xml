   THE AREA WE STUDIED IS DOMINATED BY 
 THE A3, LONDON TO PORTSMOUTH ROAD     
 WHICH INTERSECTS WITH THE HASLEMERE   
 TO FARNHAM ROAD, A287, AT THE HINDHEAD
 CROSS ROADS. TODAY IT IS THIS ROAD AND
 THE RELATIVELY FAST LINK IT PROVIDES  
 TO LONDON AND THE SOUTH, AS WELL AS TO
 HEATHROW AIRPORT VIA THE M25, WHICH   
 HAS ACCOUNTED FOR THE RAPID GROWTH AND
 POPULARITY OF THIS AREA, WHERE THE    
 MAJORITY OF THE HOUSES ARE LESS THAN  
 2O YEARS OLD.                         
  THE RURAL LANDSCAPE, AN AREA OF      
 OUTSTANDING NATURAL BEAUTY AND        
 RECREATION, CONSISTS OF A SANDSTONE   
 RIDGE WHICH RISES TO 272 METRES AT ITS
 HIGHEST POINT - GIBBET HILL AND WHICH 
 IS PART OF THE WEALDEN DOME. HOWEVER, 
 THE SANDY SOILS ARE ACID AND INFERTILE
 AND SO LITTLE USED FOR AGRICULTURE.
