		<content> But for the action of the War         
 Department towards the end of the last
 century in acquiring a large slice of 
 shingle running along the coast from  
 Jury's Gap to south of Lydd in Kent,  
 Camber and Dungeness might by now have
 been linked by a strip of bungalows.  
 As it is Camber's entity is protected 
 to the west by the Rye golf course and
 the river Rother and to the east by   
 the Lydd gun ranges part of which fall
 within the parish boundary.  Behind a 
 high wire fence which bounds the      
 Jury's Gap_Lydd road, British and NATO
 troops carry out training on a        
 recently updated complex of target    
 areas.  Fortunately for the peace and 
 quiet of the Camber residents the sort
 of heavy artillery which tried out    
 lyddite on the ranges in earlier days 
 is no longer deployed there.  All     
 firing is directed out to sea.        </content>
