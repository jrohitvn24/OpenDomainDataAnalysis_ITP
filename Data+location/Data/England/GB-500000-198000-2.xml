		<title>02THE NORMAN CONQUEST.</title>

 The Normans were fighting for land and
 conquest-the English were defending   
 their homeland,and both armies fought 
 fiercely throughout a dreadful        
 day.Once the Normans thought William  
 was wounded and had left the battle   
 field but he raised the visor of his  
 helmet and shouted "Look,I am         
 unharmed".Towards evening William     
 ordered a great volley of arrows to   
 fall on Harold ,one of the arrows     
 pierced King Harold's eye and Norman  
 sword thrusts killed him.At this point
 the heart went out of the English and 
 they yielded to William.William buried
 Harold's body on the sea-shore and    
 wrote on a stone "You rest here a     
 king,Harold,that you may be guardian  
 still of the shore and sea."
