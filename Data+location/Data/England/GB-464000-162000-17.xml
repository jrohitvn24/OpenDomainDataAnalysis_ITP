		<title>17An Oak Tree in Mortimer</title>
		<content> On June 3rd, a fine oak tree in       
 Victoria Road was felled, on land be- 
 longing to an old family business, now
 sold for development (office block and
 two houses).We found people in street,
 bakery and library very eager to      
 express their indignation:-{Old Age   
{Pensioner:}That was the meeting place 
 for all us nippers. When they cut that
 down they cut off part of Mortimer.   
{Young Parents (ecologists):}Living    
 green filling the sky, A friend in the
 village, suddenly torn out with no    
 warning leaving an aching gap.{Member 
{of history group:}Just a memory left  
 of a regrettable slaughter; many happy
 hours spent sitting in its shade with 
 friends and visitors, talking old     
 times and new.{Young parent/neighbour:
 Even a Preservation Order placed on   
 this tree, an old friend, could not   
 save it. Apparently it{had}to go.     </content>
