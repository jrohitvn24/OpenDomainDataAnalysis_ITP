		<content>My name is Denise.I am 8. I live in    
Lower Street Islip.I wake up at 8      
o'clock and have my breakfast which is 
Corn Flakes. I get dressed and clean my
teeth then come downstairs and pack my 
lunch box and my bag and get my dog's  
lead and put it on him.Then I go to    
school.I work from 9 till 12 with one  
break for a snack.I have dinner at 12  
and then go out to play.At 1.15 we come
in and read for a bit and work till    
3.30 with another short break in       
between.Then I go home and have my     
tea. I feed my dog,my hamster and my   
birds and watch television and go      
outside and water my plants.Then I get 
ready for bed.I come down with my three
teddy bears.Their names are            
Silky,Cuddles,and Honey.Then I say     
goodnight to my Mum and Dad and go to  
bed with my teddies.
