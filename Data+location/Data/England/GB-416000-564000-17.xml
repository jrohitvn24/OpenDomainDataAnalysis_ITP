		<content> You can still see remains of a turret 
 and sections of the wall parallel to  
 the West Rd. at Denton Sq.You can see 
 a doorway between the two walls and   
 the base of some small low stairs     
 on whch stood a ladder reaching to the
 upper floor.                          
                                       
 MEMORIES OF NEWBURN VILLAGE           
   I started school at 5,at Newburn    
 Manor School,then a Church School.    
 Teachers were strict and used the cane
 when necessary.Religion was divided   
 between the Parish Church and the 2   
 Chapels.School holidays were spent    
 at Ryton-Willows,on the opposite river
 bank.Money was short:we only went to  
 the seaside once a year on a free     
 Sunday School trip by boat to South   
 Shields.                              
   The main sources of employment were 
 Coal Mines in Throckley and Blutcher, </content>
