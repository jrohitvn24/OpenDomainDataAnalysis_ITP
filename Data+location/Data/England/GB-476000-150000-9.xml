		<content> Early Victorian building in walled    
 graveyard, memorials were transferred 
 from previous church in Dogmersfield  
 Park. One to right of font is by famed
 sculptor Nollekins.Gates with light   
 are modern memorials.Views of village 
 are depicted on 2 handstitched        
 kneelers at the altar rail and names  
 of residents are listed alongside. The
 benefice is united with Winchfield and
 Hartley Wintney but has its own PCC   
 and Deanery Synod representatives.    
 Services are held fortnightly         
 alternating between family service    
 with a congregational music group, and
 1662 communion with an organist. A    
 fellowship group meets on Mondays for 
 Bible study.There are occasional      
 flower festivals and other activities 
 within the benefice.At the moment     
 there is a dispute about access to the
 church hall.                          </content>
