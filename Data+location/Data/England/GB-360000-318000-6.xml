		<title>06Disused Railway Line-W.Upton</title>
		<content> Through the eastern part of this area 
 is the course of a disused railway.   
 This railway originally formed a link 
 between the Wolverhampton/Shrewsbury  
 line at Wellington,(still operating), 
 and Market Drayton, Crewe and         
 Stoke-on-Trent to the north.   The    
 line was closed during the 1960s      
 following the Beeching Report of 1963.
 As a line serving  rural area, it     
 was under-used and uneconomical.      
 There was a station at                
 Crudgington, but little evidence now  
 remains.   The opportunity to turn the
 disused line into a footpath was not  
 taken: farmers divided up the land    
 around the railway.   The track has   
 been removed and vegetation has       
 re-colonised the route.
