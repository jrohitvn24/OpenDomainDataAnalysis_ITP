		<title>17GARDEN CENTRES: WARLEY</title>
		<content>   Garden Centres are an intensive and 
 highly profitable form of land use.   
 The proximity of urban centres in     
 London's suburban belt means that they
 are highly active in the area. There  
 are two main ones. Warley Rose Gardens
 Ltd.,595894, specialises in{roses}and 
 has a{national market,}mostly in the  
 Home Counties, but extending as far as
 Scotland and to Cornwall. Roots and   
 Shoots, in Nag's Head Lane 563908, has
 a smaller market, mostly confined to a
 25 mile radius. The{M25}has helped to 
 widen this market considerably. The   
 centre specialises in{unusual shrubs  
 and{alpines.}Over 2000 Clematis are   
 sold a year. Two-thirds of the        
 business is at weekends, and Â£8,000   
 may be taken on a good day. The plants
 are mostly purchased from specialist  
 growers in the UK, prior to resale at 
 the centre.                           </content>
