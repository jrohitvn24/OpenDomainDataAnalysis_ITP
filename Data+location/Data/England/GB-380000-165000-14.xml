		<title>14LOOKING AT KINGSDOWN HOUSE.</title>
		<content>  A group of us went to interview Miss 
 Pyke.Miss Pyke lives in part of       
{Kingsdown House.}When we got there we 
 were greeted by a{peacock}called      
 Alexander who belongs to Miss Pyke.   
 Miss Pyke has lived at Kingsdown House
 for about 20 years.It was a{mental    
{home}built from{local stone}in the    
 early 17th century.The other seven    
 parts were built in the 18th century. 
  The fields surrounding the house are 
 mostly{farmland and gardens.}The      
 farmland is mostly{cattle}(milk and   
 beef)and{arable.                      
   There are some{Tumuli}very near     
 Kingsdown House and it is where some  
 people were buried.Miss Pyke said that
 Kingsdown is so called because it used
 to be a{down}(or free land) and the   
{King}was supposed to own it all.      
  Nearby,too, is an area called{Blue   
{Vein-}named after the bed-rock colour.</content>
