		<title>11EDUCATION IN KEMPSFORD AREA</title>
		<content>  In their twelfth year, pupils leave  
 the primary school in{Kempsford       
 village at the end of the Summer Term 
 and start the{secondary}phase of their
 education in September. Those children
 who live within {Gloucestershire}are  
 transported daily to{Farmor's         
{Comprehensive School}in{Fairford,}    
 providing education for 11 to 18 year 
 olds. Those children who live in{     
{Marston Meysey}and{Castle Eaton}in{   
{Wiltshire}come within the catchment   
 area of {Highworth Comprehensive},    
 although some, upon request, attend   
 Farmor's. Co-operation between        
 Farmor's and the primary school,such  
 as visits and consultation, assure a  
 smooth transfer. Pupils may leave     
 school at 16 and some opt to attend a 
 Technical College at{Swindon}but they 
 have to provide their own transport.
