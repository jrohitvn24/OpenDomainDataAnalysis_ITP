		<title>08BASILDON NE: LOCAL SURVEY</title>
		<content> Children from a local school asked    
 their parents what they liked least   
 about Basildon.                       
 The ten most common answers were:     
  1. Litter. Left as much by adults as 
 by children, paper and old mattresses 
 are untidy, but broken glass and the  
 like are a danger.                    
  2. Overcrowding. Houses are too close
 together, and there are too few to    
 house the second generation families. 
  3. Expensive inner town travel and   
 poor and unreliable bus service.      
  4. Vandalism.                        
  5. High crime rate.                  
  6. High unemployment.                
  7. The layout of the housing.        
  8. High rates.                       
  9. High car parking fees.            
 10. Basildon's bad reputation, in that
     it appears a town of problems.
