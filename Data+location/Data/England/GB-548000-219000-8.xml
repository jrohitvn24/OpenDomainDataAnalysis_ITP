		<content> KATE RAMBRIDGE takes a humorous look  
 at the girls of today.                
 This being a girls' school, it is easy
 to list several characteristics unique
 to schoolgirls of this age. Most      
 teenage girls seem to have a morbid   
 fixation for Howard Jones or some     
 other microphone-ridden young man;    
 some carry this passion further than  
 others! The school uniform restricts  
 the young ladies preferred strange    
 appearance (eg. luminous pink socks,  
 two foot long earrings and truly      
 horrific tee-shirts) except in the    
 mighty sixth, where they parade in    
 whatever they please, doing their     
 level best to ignore all the other    
 years.                                
 Teachers are a strange lot too. Gone  
 is the age of strict, grey-haired     
 mistresses, but a few relics have     
 survived beside the dynamic new breed.</content>
