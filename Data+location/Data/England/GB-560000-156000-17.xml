		<title>17POPULATION MOVEMENT IN PLATT</title>
		<content>   We carried out a survey of the      
movement of people in our area. The    
average person had lived in Platt for  
13.2 years. The majority of people     
surveyed were born in Kent with a few  
born in London. Most people had moved  
within the county of Kent and the      
numberof moves averaged 3.6. Travel to 
places of employment was mostly by car 
but a considerable number travelled by 
train. Most people worked outside the  
area, particularly in London.          
   We interviewed Mrs.Sherman who has  
lived in Platt for almost 50 years. She
lives in the house next door to our    
school where she taught for 41 years.  
When she came the school was much      
smaller and there were not so many     
houses on Platt Common Lane. She is not
sure she likes all the changes but does
not want to move away.
