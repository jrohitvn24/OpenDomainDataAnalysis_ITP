		<title>19LAW AND ORDER IN DIPTON.</title>
		<content> The village of Dipton is policed by   
 officers at the sub police station at 
 Catchgate.All the officers wear       
 uniforms which are black with silver  
 buttons.They wear helmets or flat caps
 if they are in a Panda,(Patrol Car).  
   I interviewed P.C.Cowan &amp; this is   
 what he told me.                      
  {You have to be 18.5yrs.before you   
{join the Force.P.C.Cowan has been in  
{for 9yrs.The youngest officer in      
{Catchgate station is 22yrs.There are  
{no women in this station.They do not  
{have any Police Dogs and all officers 
{carry personal radios known as "walkie
{talkies".This is so they can be in    
{contact with the station no matter    
{where they are,as they may be on car  
{patrol or walking their "beat".       
  You are allowed to stay in the Force 
 for 30 years then you retire with a   
 special Pension...by DONNA CATTERMOLE.</content>
