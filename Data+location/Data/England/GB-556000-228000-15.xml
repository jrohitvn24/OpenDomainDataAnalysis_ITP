		<title>15Chickney, goodwill attitudes</title>
		<content> Some opposition toi project but       
 attitudes mostly very co-operative    
 especially from those of long Essex   
 family history. Some farmers resent   
 walkers and horseriders on their land.
 Established bridle and footpaths give 
 public right of way but this is       
 sometimes abused; crops damaged, gates
 left open, animals straying into      
 danger and even causing road          
 accidents. Thus, as there is no       
 trespass law, the farmer has no       
 re-dress. Another aspect fof the      
 problem which reacts against the      
 public's rights, is deliberate acts of
 vandalism whereby signposts have been 
 removed resulting in the ploughing up 
 of unmarked paths by farmers. Efforts 
 are being made to promote goodwill by 
 educating the public to cooperate with
 the farmer.In small residential groups
 a good community spirit prevails.     </content>
