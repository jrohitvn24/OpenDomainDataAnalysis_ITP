 Preston school do Maypole dancing on  
 the village green.The girls wear      
 frilly blouses and silky skirts       
 coloured red,yellow,blue or green.We  
 do three dances:Barbers pole,Spiders  
 web and plaiting.The boys do Morris   
 dancing with sticks in their hands and
 bells on their feet.                  
  There is a ceromony to crown the new 
 May queen.The infant class start the  
 dancing with the shoemakers dance.    
  After the dancing has finished we all
 go back to school led by Settle Brass 
 Band.There we have competitions to see
 who has the best decorated cake,boiled
 egg or longest dandelion leaf.        
  After Long Preston May Day the
