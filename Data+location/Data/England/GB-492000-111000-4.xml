		<content> IDES COMMON AND ST MARY'S WOOD        
                                       
 Not all of St Mary's Wood, which      
 further east joins Eartham Wood is in 
 this area, but all these woodlands are
 of standing timber made up of beech,  
 sycamore, ash, conifers and some oak. 
 In these woods a resident of East     
 Dean, Mr Gordon Long, has a workshop  
 from which he works the woodlands.  He
 is also well known for his corn       
 dollies.
