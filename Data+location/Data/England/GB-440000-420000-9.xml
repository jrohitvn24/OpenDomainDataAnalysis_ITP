		<title>09Entertainment-Featherstone</title>
		<content> The main type of entertainment in the 
 town are the public houses,working    
 men's clubs and the bingo hall.       
 The town does boast its own Amateur,  
 Musical and Dramatic Society which was
 started in 1944.Most of its members   
 live in Featherstone or Pontefract and
 meet twice a week.Some families have  
 long association with the society.    
 Performances were held at the Welfare 
 Centre until the Civic Centre was     
 built at Castleford.Usually they have 
 two performances a year,one in June   
 when a Gilbert and Sullivan Opera is  
 staged and a November pantomime.Many  
 costumes are made by the company but  
 specialist wear is hired as is some of
 the scenery.The musicians come from   
 the local youth orchestras and some   
 are related to members of the company.
 The company perform at charity        
 affairs.                              </content>
