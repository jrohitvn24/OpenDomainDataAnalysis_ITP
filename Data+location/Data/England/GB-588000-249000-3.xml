		<title>03The Guildhall</title>
		<content>This is a large timber-framed building 
in the Market Square.It was built in   
1528 by the Guild of Corpus Christi    
for people to come together to sell    
wool. The porch has carved doorposts   
and inside there are large fire-places 
and wide,carved beams.The National     
Trust owns the Guildhall now and runs  
it as a museum.In the cellar you can   
see how barrels were made.There is an  
old fire-engine.Upstairs a display     
shows how Lavenham Blue Cloth was made 
and many other interesting things. The 
building was only used as a Guildhall  
for about 30 years.It has been a       
prison,a meeting-place for clothiers,a 
work-house,a nursery school and a club 
for American airmen during the war.The 
distinctive pattern of marks on the    
front wall was probably caused by      
children sharpening slate pencils.
