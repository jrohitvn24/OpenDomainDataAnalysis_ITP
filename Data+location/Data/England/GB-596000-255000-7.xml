		<title>07Buxhall - Housing</title>
		<content> There are{140 dwellings}in the area   
 (including 3 derelict). 50% are in the
 main village of Buxhall which is      
 grouped around the Crown Public House,
 Mill and former school. Much of the   
 housing in the village is{local       
{authority}built in the 1930s and 50s. 
 In the area as a whole 55 houses pre- 
 date 1800: 16 built 1800-1914: 19 from
 1914-1945: 37 1945-1960: 9 1960-1975  
 and 4 1975-1985. There have been few  
{new houses}in the area, a reflection  
 of its rural character and in part the
 restrictive planning policy applying. 
                                       
 About 30% of families in the area are 
 "local" having lived there more than  
 one generation.Most have links with   
 agriculture, as farmworkers or        
 farmers. Over the years families with 
 less strong links with the land tend  
 to move away to find houses or work.  </content>
