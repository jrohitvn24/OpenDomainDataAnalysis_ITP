		<content>     Longnor is a small parish on the  
sandstone ridge between the rivers Dove
and Manifold.  It is thought that the  
name means 'Long Ridge'.  The steep    
face of the ridge which faces North and
East is pasture with much thorn and    
gorse scrub.  The gentler face of the  
ridge towards the South and the West is
now covered with meadow and pasture.   
There is a series of long narrow fields
running from the top of the ridge on   
this side to the River Manifold and it 
is thought that these field boundaries 
mark the site of a strip-field system  
of farming.                            
     On the other side of the Dove is  
the steep limestone slope to the       
rolling tops of the southern end of the
White Peak.  This part in notable for  
the lack of surface drainage and the   
number of dew ponds.
