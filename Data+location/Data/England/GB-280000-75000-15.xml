		<content> At{Aidees}the employees put perfume in
 the pomanders. They have several      
 barrels of{lavender}and {roses.}Women 
 also put{transfers}on{soaps}and{soap  
{dishes}and sometimes even{tiles.}To   
 make the transfers stick on properly  
 and make the colours clearer they have
 to put wax over them.The ingredients  
 of soaps are tallow,salts, water and  
 perfume.Some soaps go with soap dishes
 with the same transfers on.When the   
 pomanders, soaps and soap dishes are  
 packed, they are put in plastic bags  
 and put in boxes.The boxes also have  
 in them polystyrene chips to protect  
 them.The transfers  are sometimes put 
 on the tiles for a certain design so  
 that there is more choice and so that 
 they are not all plain.Also in the    
 factory they have little clay houses  
 as pomanders. They stack the transfers
 on shelves,ready to take down quickly.</content>
