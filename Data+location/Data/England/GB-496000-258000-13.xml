		<title>13Odells Leather Industry</title>
		<content> There was an established{leather      
{dressing plant}on the River Ouse, in  
 Odell, in the last century, and it was
 in 1919 that the then owner,{Philip   
{Westley, built his new factory}at a   
 cost of 20,000 pounds sterling.       
 Bankruptcy forced the sale of the     
 factory which has since become the    
 home of{Odell Leather Industries.     
 Ready tanned hides are purchased from 
 many parts of the world; in Odell they
 are 'dressed'-prepared for sale to the
 fashion industry.  In the 1970's a new
 department was set up to use surplus  
 materials for the manufacture of belts
 and handbags.                         
  225 people are employed in the works 
  in Odell, many of them transported to
 work in their fleet of mini-buses.    
  The manager told us that it would be 
 difficult to find enough employees    
 without free transport.               </content>
