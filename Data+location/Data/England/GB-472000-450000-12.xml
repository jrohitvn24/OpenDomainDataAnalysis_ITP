		<title>12WILBERFOSS DUTCH ELM DISEASE</title>
		<content>   Many of the elms in Wilberfoss have 
 died from Dutch Elm Disease.  In the  
 York area it has been quite serious   
 with85% of trees infected.  Trees     
 which are found to have the disease   
 should be cut down and the whole tree,
 especially the bark, burned.Trees can 
 be saved, say the Forestry Commission 
 by spraying against elm bark beetle as
 soon as any disease is found in elms  
 close to each other.                  
   The loss of elms has had a very bad 
 effect on the environment, as elms    
 were once very common in the area,    
 particularly in hedgerows, but it is  
 hoped that lime trees may be planted  
 as a substitute for lost elms. Many   
 rookeries have been lost and the birds
 now have to nest in trees which are   
 not to their liking.
