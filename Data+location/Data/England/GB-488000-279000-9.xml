		<title>09Warkton's charm, Kettering.</title>
		<content>  People who were interviewed said that
the village itself had not changed     
greatly over the years.  However, there
were many new people and few who were  
born in the village remained.          
  It is pleasing to see that properties
and the churchyard are so well cared   
for.                                   
  The former village school is used as 
a meeting room and the old bakery has  
been converted to a house.             
  An elderly resident remembers        
villagers taking their Sunday dinners  
to be cooked at the bakery while they  
were in church!                        
  Much traffic by-passes Kettering     
leaving the A43 and making for the A6  
via the edge of Warkton.  Elsewhere in 
the village all is quiet.              
   The Post Office is in the front room
of a house and is open for rather less 
hours than larger places elsewhere.    </content>
