		<title>10WOODLAND</title>
		<content> A mainly rural square covered by      
 grassland with thorn hedges separating
 fields.Small concentrations of        
 woodland are also a feature especially
 near Rottington and along stretches of
 minor roads.Rottington Hall farm is   
 the biggest in the square with        
 Byersteads farm the only other feature
 worthy of note.It is interesting to   
 note that the name Rottington is      
 supposed to have derived its name fron
 a Viking chief who settled in the     
 area.Some locals believe that it is   
 here that St.Bega built her nunnery   
 and not St.Bees.However, until now no 
 definite evidence exists.
