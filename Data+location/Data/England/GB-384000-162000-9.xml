		<content> The land in this area is good         
 agricultural land with little         
 waste-land. Of the sixteen farms in   
 the area only Common Farm and Lower   
 Farm are dairy farms, the remainder   
 produce beef, maize, corn and oil seed
 rape. Less hay is produced than in the
 past as silage is now the main cattle 
 fodder. The profit margin in all      
 aspects of farming and greater        
 efficiency ie round baling of grass,  
 has led to fewer men being employed on
 the land, helping to reduce production
 costs.                                
 ATTITUDES ON FARMING                  
 Concern is expressed in the farming   
 community that even with greater      
 efficiency, overproduction in the EEC 
 threatens the future of farming in    
 Britain, reducing the numbers employed
 on the land and the demise of rural   
 communities such as this.             </content>
