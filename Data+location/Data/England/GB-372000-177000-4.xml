		<content> THE TOLL HOUSE.                       
 200 years ago this was built to       
 collect tolls on the road between Bath
 and Stroud.Built for a small family it
 has had to be                         
 extended.Originally there             
 were two rooms only,now there         
 are seven. Although beside            
 the M4 life is reasonably quiet.The   
 present owner has lived there for     
 seven years but previous owners have  
 been traced back to the Codrington    
 family.2.5 acres of land surround the 
 house where there is a colourful      
 flower garden.Hens and ducks are kept 
 and the eggs sold to passing          
 motorists.In the garden are "cats'    
 eyes" which were on the road, closed  
 when the M4 opened.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
