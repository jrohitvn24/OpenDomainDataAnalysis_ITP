		<content> The estuary contains Salmon, Mullet,  
 Flounders, Trout, Eels, all fished in 
 season.  Large flocks of sea-birds    
 also feed off the numerous molluscs   
 and bivalves. Many birdwatchers come  
 to see them at migration times.  There
 is evidence of a submerged forest on  
 very low tides, east of Bowness       
 village. Glacial debris along southern
 estuary shore includes granite carried
 south from Scotland. Scours: hummocks 
 of boulder clay laid East-to-West in  
 direction of glacial flow. Pockets of 
 quicksand are found where creeks or   
 springs enter. (A horse sank as       
 recently as l980). Tides average      
 20-30ft. The bore (up to three feet   
 high) may be seen when conditions are 
 right. The tide runs very quickly,    
 especially under a westerly gale.     
 .Bowness Moss has been designated an  
 area of Special Scientific Interest.  </content>
