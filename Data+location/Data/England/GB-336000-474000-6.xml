		<content>  {Flookburgh Cooperative}is a group of
 local fishermen working together to   
 have their catches processed and then 
 distributed across the country.       
                                       
   Three main products are involved,   
 shrimps, cockles and whitebait.       
   The shrimps are cleaned, cooked in  
 butter and spices, and then weighed in
 to tubs.Each tub is sealed with butter
 and frozen,ready to be delivered. The 
 products are sent all over the country
 and they are very popular.            
                                       
   There is a staff of six, including  
 the manager and three ladies who      
 process the catches. One lady has been
 with the Cooperative for 23 years.
