		<title>15LIFE IN ST COLUMB MINOR</title>
		<content> The church is very old and is the     
 oldest part of St.Columb Minor.The    
 grave yard is nearly full and they are
 using another cemetery nearby. The    
 vicar at this church also serves the  
 Colan area                            
 St.Columb Minor has a public park     
 which was recently created.There are  
 swings, a rocking horse,slide and     
 climbing frames provided,which makes  
 an exellent focility for the children 
 living in the nearby RAF quarters.    
 Adjoining these quarters there are    
 some older houses that were built in  
 1930,but there are newer houses at the
 top of Leader Road.They were built in 
 1970.Many houses which were previously
 rented from the Council have now been 
 bought by the tenants in line with    
 recent goverment policy.In summer time
 wildflowers include foxgloves,dogroses
 brambles,honeysuckle and cornflowers. </content>
