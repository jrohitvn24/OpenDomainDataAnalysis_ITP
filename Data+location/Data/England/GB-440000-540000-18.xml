		<title>18Peterlee Tertiary College.</title>
		<content>{Peterlee}now has its own newly formed 
{Tertiary College,}running a wide range
 of academic and vocational courses, as
 well as a centre for local unemployed 
 people.The centre aims both to educate
 and entertain the unemployed, and     
 attempts to develop such skills as    
 family budgetting and interviewing    
 techniques. Peterlee was an obvious   
 place for the setting up of such a    
 college. The local{population}totals  
 23,000 with its{catchment area        
 bringing in another 528,000. This,    
 coupled with the fact that it is an   
 area of{high unemployment,}means that 
 all resources found at the college are
 put to maximum use. The setting up of 
 the Tertiary  College has been met    
 with a very mixed reception. Although 
 many people are in favour and the     
 courses are quite well attended, many 
 people think it is a{"white elephant".</content>
