		<content> Cornish wrestling has always been in  
 the area.The object is to get your    
 opponent onto the floor.Wrestlers wear
 sacking tops &amp; shorts.An annual       
 competition is held in St Stephen with
 competitors from all over Cornwall.A  
 record of the winners is on view at   
 the "Queen's Arms'" public house in   
 the village.Nearby villages seem to   
 have more facilities for social and   
 sporting activities than St Stephen.St
 Stephen though does have:A village    
 hall,pubs,A bowling club &amp; a Tennis   
 club.Bowling is particularly popular  
 among the older villagers.The club has
 been going since 1929 and there is    
 keen competition with other village   
 clubs.Successful players win their    
 Cornwall badge and get to play for the
 county.
