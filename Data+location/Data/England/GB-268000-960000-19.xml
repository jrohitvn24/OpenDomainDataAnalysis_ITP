		<content>{BETTYHILL AMBULANCE DRIVER }Very often
 in small villages, people have more   
 than one job. This is essential so    
 that services can be maintained. One  
 man who has several jobs is the local 
 ambulance driver who is also car hirer
 and shop keeper in addition to running
 a large croft. We interviewed the     
 driver to find out what having all    
 these jobs is like. He told us he     
 preferred working on his croft and    
 sometimes had very long runs to do    
 with the ambulance between Inverness, 
 Wick, Golspie or Thurso. He enjoys    
 living and working in Bettyhill but   
 would like to see a proper access road
 to Farr Beach and a youth centre built
 in Bettyhill to accommodate the       
 teenagers.
