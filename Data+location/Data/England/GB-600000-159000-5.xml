		<title>05  THE BREWING INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> There are two breweries in Faversham. 
Whitbread and Shepherd Neame.          
Approximately 150 people work at each  
today,compared to 600 in the past.This 
drop is due to improved technology.The 
hops are picked at farms like Queens   
Court and Brenley and processed at the 
brewery.Lorries are now used instead of
drays,wooden barrels have given way to 
aluminium kegs.                        
 The Golding and Wye Challenger hops   
are made into five varieties of barrel 
beer and seven of bottled beer.The     
production of beer has increased by 50%
to 156,000 barrels a year.             
 Water is pumped from a 200' well,the  
original artesian bore.The automatic   
bottling line can wash,fill,cap and    
crate more than 14,000 bottles an      
hour,however this automation has cost  
many jobs traditionally done by        
women.                                 </content>
