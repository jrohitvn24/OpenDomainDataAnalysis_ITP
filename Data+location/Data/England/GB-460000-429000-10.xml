		<content> The{officer in charge}is Mr.Somers.The
{brigade}gave a show of a ladder drill,
 tower drill &amp; a hose drill. As quickly
 as possible they got to work. Before  
 you knew it they got all the pipes out
 &amp; hoses, suction tubes &amp; ground sprays
 We put our fingers up the hole where  
 the water comes out. Then we looked   
 around the{fire engine.}They have 2   
 engines at{SELBY FIRE STATION,}each   
 well equipped for serious{FIRES.}At   
 the back of the engine are three hose 
 pipe slots. Inside the compartments   
 are extra suits &amp; hose pipes, foam    
 equipment and branches. In the fire   
 men's seats are cylinders of oxygen.  
 On top of the engine are ladders, one 
 short and an extra long one and an    
 extension. We asked Mr. Somers if he  
 had ever saved an animal. He told us a
 donkey. He also saved 2 people in a   
 car from an icy river.                </content>
