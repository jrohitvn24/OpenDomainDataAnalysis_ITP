		<content>  The River Otter rises in the         
 Blackdown Hills, at Otterhead Lakes   
 and flows North of Honiton. The water 
 is very clear. Fly fishermen fish for 
 natural brown trout, some sea trout   
 and stocked rainbow trout.            
  The river and bankside vegetation    
 supports a rich insect population.    
 This is one reason for the quality of 
 the trout. The river has a mayfly     
 hatch. Butterflies are common         
 including the small blue.             
  Badgers are seen regularly along its 
 banks as are deer. The otter is       
 possibly extinct on the river but the 
 mink, an escapee from fur farms is now
 a pest.                               
  The National Trust Combe Wood is     
 noted for wildflowers particularly for
 bluebells and primroses. Its mixed    
 woodland supports many species of     
 birds.                                </content>
