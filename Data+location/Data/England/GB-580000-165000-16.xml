		<content>By the {River Medway} is {Gillingham   
Country Par}k.It covers a strip of     
foreshore about 2 miles long,and up to 
100 meters wide.It is mostly wild      
grassland and saltings,with good views 
over the river.                        
{Berengrave Nature Reserve} is a       
disused chalkpit which remains of an   
old wash mill.A very rare plant is the 
{Round Leaved Wintergreen}.There is a  
pool which shelters a lot of water     
birds such as the {Coot,Moorhen,Little 
Grebe and Reed Warbler}.There are 2    
main types of {Reed},the {Phragmites}  
and the {Typha}.Around the pool grow   
many {Buddleia} bushes,a favourite food
for butterflies.The {Carr}or damp      
woodland is flooded in winter.The {Holm
Oak} is the home of {Jays}.The nature  
reserve is a quiet and peaceful place  
and we  felt we were in the            
countryside.                           </content>
