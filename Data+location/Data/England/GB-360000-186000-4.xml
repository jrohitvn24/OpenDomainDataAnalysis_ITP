		<content> The old Church was built in           
 Rudgeway.Most people chose for the    
 Church to move with them from Rudgeway
 to Alveston.People still living in    
 Rudgeway would have preferred the old 
 Church to be rebuilt and not to go to 
 Alveston on Sunday.                   
 The Methodist Church and the C of E   
 Church have united services every     
 month.There are two morning services  
 one at the Methodist and one at the C 
 of E.In the evening the services are  
 always joint and revolve from Church  
 to Church.There is a joint Church     
 council with representatives from both
 Churches which decide important issues
 involving the Churches.Some members   
 are against the Churches working      
 together because they fear they could 
 lose their identities and             
 traditions.The Churches have joint    
 finances and have fund raising events.</content>
