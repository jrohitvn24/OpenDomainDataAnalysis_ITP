		<title>08HELSTON MUSEUM</title>
		<content> The Helston Museum was formerly a     
 butter and meat market(1837).         
   The Museum was opened in{1949}and   
 the first curator was{William.F.      
{Dolton (1946-70). }                   
   The curator is now{Mr Martin        
{Matthews.}When it was a butter and    
 meat market farmers wives used to come
 in to sell their produce.             
   After the war many people wished to 
 get rid of everyday objects that were 
 around the house. Mr Dolton asked them
 if he could display them in his       
 pub"The Bee Hive," instead of throwing
 them away. Soon he found that he      
 needed more room to display the       
 objects and as the butter and meat    
 market was not then in use it proved  
 to be an ideal place. It is now owned 
 by Kerrier Council. Its most prized   
 possessions are a dinner service made 
 in china clay from Tregonning Hill.   </content>
