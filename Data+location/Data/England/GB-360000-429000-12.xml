		<title>12MOVING INTO SAMLESBURY</title>
		<content>  When I moved into Samlesbury, I felt 
a bit lonely because I did not know any
of the children and I could not find my
way around. It was very different here 
because there are only 40 pupils here, 
and my old school has 270 juniors and  
160 infants. Here we have all the      
juniors in one class so my sister is in
the class with me.                     
  When I want to play with my friends  
here, I have to walk across the fields,
whereas, in Blackburn, I just walked a 
few metres along the street. There is  
only one shop here and that is 3/4mile 
only one shop here and that is 3/4 mile
away. Here we have a coal fire instead 
of a gas fire. Our house used to       
be a farmhouse. The barn  is going     
to be a house soon so there may be     
some more chidren to play with. Many   
barns and farms are being turned into  
ordinary housing.                      </content>
