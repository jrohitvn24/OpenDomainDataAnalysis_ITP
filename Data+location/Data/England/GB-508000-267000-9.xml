		<title>09Kimbolton - Expansion</title>
		<content>    The{village plan (1977)}allows     
 steady growth of the population by 50%
 to reach about 1600 by 1991,similar   
 to the peak population of 1851.       
    This expansion is being effected by
 infilling at{Stonely}- a hamlet which 
 has evolved into a prosperous and     
 independent suburb of Kimbolton.      
    In{Kimbolton}itself,most of the new
 building has been concentrated within 
 the former kitchen-garden to the      
 castle, where 48 houses, mostly       
 executive type, have been erected.    
 Both Parish and District Councils have
 demanded a high standard of design    
 to blend with the village's character.
 At{Newtown}a similar development      
 has just passed the detailed planning 
 stage. Again the lack of cheaper      
 "starter" homes may bring short-term  
 prosperity but in the long-term damage
 to the balance of the community.      </content>
