		<title>02THE HISTORY OF WAULDBY FARM</title>
		<content>                                       
   The farmhouse  of Wauldby Manor     
 Farm was built approximately in 1830. 
 The farm is run by a family           
 who moved in, 14 years ago. They have 
 in their grounds, a Chapel which was  
 also built around the same time as the
 house. The Chapel has not been used   
 since 1920,yet the farmer's           
 grandson was christened there in 1975.
 In 1976, with a few friends the       
 farmer's wife  cleaned the Chapel out 
 and held a flower festival in aid of  
 the Royal National Lifeboat           
 Institution. The Chapel was the Lady  
 Chapel to Elloughton Church. It used  
 to have a belfry, but the belfry      
 became dangerous and had to be taken  
 down.
