		<content> The oldest in this area, this church  
 was built in 1746 to replace a chapel 
 which had been abandoned because of   
 the encroachment of the sea. It has an
 average Sunday morning family service 
 congregation of 220. There are 188    
 people on its Electoral Roll, 156 of  
 whom live within the parish. The      
 present incumbent is Canon Norman     
 Carter. He has no full-time assistants
 but is helped by one other priest and 
 two lay-readers.

{You want to whisper there.            
{A stained glass window towers above   
{the altar.                            
{A gold cross stands proudly in front. 
{The lectern is a carved eagle.        
{Banners hang silently round the church
