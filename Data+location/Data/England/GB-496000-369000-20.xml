		<title>20HOUSING, LINCOLN.</title>
		<content> Much of the  housing in our area dates
 from  the {Victorian }and {Edwardian  
{era.}The {slum  terraces }were knocked
 down  in the {50's and  60's} and  the
 majority  have  been  modernised. The 
 larger  and often older houses tend to
 be in  uphill  Lincoln.The{new estates
 are  on the fringes  of our area.There
 has  been  a fair amount of{conversion
 of old houses into{flats.             
  Thanks are due to;
