 were until recently{dairy herds.}Some 
 farmers have{horses}on their land, but
 these are for domestic use and not    
 part of the working farm.             
   Beef{cattle}are{slaughtered}at 18   
 months to{2 years old.}               
  {Lambs}are sent for{slaughter}at     
 around{6 months,}with carcases weigh_ 
 ing roughly{15 kilos.                 
   Producers are awarded a{quality     
{premium}if the carcase is of accept_  
 able{size}and{leanness,}thus control_ 
 ling quality from the farmers.        
   There has been great controversy    
 over recent plans to instal a{lairage 
 on the outskirts of the village.      
 Residents are against the plan due to 
{increased traffic}day and night, and  
{distress}caused to the{animals.}The   
 problem was unresolved in late 1985.  </content>
