		<content> Gypsy women do ragging which is       
 asking for old clothes, and selling   
 from a basket. They have to be        
 prepared to walk at least 10 miles    
 though. In the caravans it is very    
 clean. The walls are made from chrome 
 and there are a lot of things which   
 are cut glass. The Travellers also    
 have stereos and videos. They call us 
 "GOUJO".                              
  11th May 1985. Today is the          
 21st anniversary of the Junior end of 
{Eye Church of England school}.        
 (9.30)                                
 Great! It was time for our swimming   
 lesson. We grabbed our swimming bags  
 and lined up. On the way we stopped to
 let Mrs Nicol take a photo of us all. 
 When we got to the pool we put our    
 swimming costumes on and jumped into  
 the water.We did front crawl and then 
 back stroke.It was enjoyable.         </content>
