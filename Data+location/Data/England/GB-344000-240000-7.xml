		<content> Here as elsewhere local government is 
 carried on at three separate levels:  
 county council, district council and -
 the most local - parish council.      
 For county council elections, counties
 are split into electoral divisions and
 elections are held every fourth year -
 1985, 1989, etc., with all councillors
 retiring. All of the block is in the  
 county of Hereford and Worcester, and 
 most of it in the electoral division  
 of Dinmore.                           
 For district council elections, the   
 electoral unit is the ward. For each  
 of 3 years running, a third of the    
 district councillors retire and       
 elections are held in those wards. In 
 the fourth year, when county council  
 elections are held, there are no      
 district council elections.
