		<title>10The Vine, Sevenoaks</title>
		<content>The Vine is located near the centre of 
Sevenoaks at the bottom of the High    
Street. On the Vine is a cricket ground
and clubhouse, War memorial and Rest   
gardens. The Vine Cricket ground is the
oldest in England and was the first to 
use three stumps and two bails. The    
Vine is now a private club and is      
involved in training younger players.  
On the Vine are the seven oak trees    
from which Sevenoaks gets its name. The
War Memorial stands at the top of St.  
Botolphs Road. It is the statue of a   
soldier and represents those people    
from Sevenoaks who fought and died in  
the War. The Rest garden is a place    
where people are able to sit in        
pleasant surroundings. There are a few 
flower beds and a fishpond over which  
there is a man made bridge.
