		<title>06EDUCATION IN NEWTOWN AREA</title>
		<content> The majority of children in the grid  
 area will attend Newtown School from  
 5-8 years, Droxford School from 8-11  
 years and Swanmore (Comprehensive)    
 School from 11-16 years. The          
 designated college for higher         
 education is at Eastleigh and there   
 are further education colleges at     
 Fareham, Eastleigh and Cosham.        
 Children who do not live within       
 Newtown parish follow a slightly      
 different pattern.                    
 Newtown's catchment also covers an    
 area outside of the grid. In 1985     
 three teachers taught 60 pupils, one  
 third of whom came from outside the   
 catchment area because of the school's
 good name. The school day lasts from  
 9 to 3.15, with 2 playtime breaks.    
 School lunches, cooked at Droxford    
 School, are eaten by about half the   
 pupils, the rest have packed lunch.   </content>
