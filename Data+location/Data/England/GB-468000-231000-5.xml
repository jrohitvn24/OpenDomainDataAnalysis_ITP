		<title>05The Manor House</title>
		<content>   In 1086{William  the  Conqueror gave
{the Manor to Walter }Giffard, Earl  of
 Buckingham. The Lord lived in a castle
 which was built  on  Church  Hill. The
 Manor House  was used  by  the  church
 until the {Reformation.}The Prebend or
 Priest lived in  the  house. The house
 was brought by the{Duke of Buckingham.
   Nowdays the Lester  family  own  the
 house. One  of  the  last Prebends was
 William Smythe (1507-1528). He had the
 famous{twisted chimney }built which is
 twisted on the{inside}and the outside.
 Pebendary  John Rudyng  installed fire
 places in the  Manor  House  in the 15
 century. As the house is so big it has
 been  made  into {two houses.         
{ }On the front of the Manor House is a
 picture of a{cherub,}some people think
 it may be a symbol of St. Rumwold.
