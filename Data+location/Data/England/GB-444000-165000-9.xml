		<title>09THE TRAFFIC IN NEWBURY</title>
		<content> Newbury is a very busy place because  
 the traffic from the north of England 
 is slowing down the local traffic.The 
 traffic going through Newbury from the
 M4 is travelling to Southampton or    
 Portsmouth.Owing to the docks in these
 two towns there are many large, noisy 
 vehicles rumbling along our ring road.
                                       
 Some people are thinking of building  
 a fly-over to ease the local          
 traffic.If it is built it will be     
 much easier to get around our town by 
 car.                                  
                                       
 The car parks are often full          
 but because there are so many you are 
 bound to find a parking space except  
 on Thursdays when the open air        
 market is held.                       
                                       
                                       </content>
