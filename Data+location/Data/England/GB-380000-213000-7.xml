		<content>  The village of Whaddon is just       
 outside the southern boundary of      
 Gloucester. It is part of the civil   
 parish of Brookthorpe-with-Whaddon,   
 and, since 1982, of the ecclesiastical
 parish of St. George (in Tuffley).    
  The church, dedicated to St. Margaret
 probably dates from 1150-1200. Its    
 font dates from the 14th century. The 
 East window by Ninian Comper is       
 "signed" with a sprig of wild straw-  
 berry.                                
  Wynstones School, in the former Manor
 House, is founded on the principles of
 Rudolf Steiner. It emphasises the     
 importance of presenting lessons as   
 artistically as possible. Most of the 
 pupils are day children but there are 
 also 50-60 boarders.There is no head- 
 teacher:the body of teachers takes    
 all the decisions of the school.
