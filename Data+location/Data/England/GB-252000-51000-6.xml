		<content> Nutley  Lodge is a residential home   
 housed at 43 Sherford Road, Elburton. 
 Originally built in 1925. Mr. Woodcock
 bought the house from Mr. May in 1977 
 and converted it into a residential   
 home in 1984. He started it because   
 (I) there was not a good residential  
 home in the area{(II)}the house was   
 suited for the purpose{(III)}it was   
 something that he always wanted to do.
 An extension has just been built      
 increasing the number of rooms for the
 elderly to eighteen. The house has to 
 be at a temperature of at least 70    
 degrees Celsius. There are 12 elderly 
 people living in the house at present.
 The rooms are equipped to safety      
 standards. The average age for the    
 ladies is 85 with the oldest being 92 
 years old. We came to the conclusion  
 that they like it very much at Nutley 
 Lodge.                                </content>
