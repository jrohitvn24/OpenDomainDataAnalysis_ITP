		<title>08THE CORNER SHOP.</title>
		<content> The corner shop on Woodfield Road is  
 open from 8.30 a.m.to 7.00 p.m., six  
 days a week, serving people from the  
 local community.                      
 Each morning there are deliveries of  
 fresh bread, cream cakes, milk and    
 vegetables. Other items for sale are  
 bought from large wholesale stores    
 twice a week. The value of the goods  
 normally in stock is Â£12,000.         
 During the day the shopkeeper and her 
 staff keep the shelves filled, cut the
 cold meats and serve the customers.   
 From a survey carried out recently it 
 was discovered that Monday was the    
 busiest day.                          
 Elderly people enjoy visiting the shop
 because of the friendly atmosphere. If
 they are ill and not able to do their 
 own shopping the shopkeeper will      
 deliver their orders and spend a      
 little time with them.                </content>
