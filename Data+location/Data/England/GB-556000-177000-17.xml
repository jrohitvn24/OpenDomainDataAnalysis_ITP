		<title>17A VISIT TO WEST THURROCK</title>
		<content>  We went to visit West Thurrock and on
 the way we were shown an old railway  
 line as we were passing Mill Lane.    
 Then we went to the lakeside          
 Development and were shown where the  
 chalk had been dug away about five or 
 six years ago.We also saw the cement  
 works where some factories have been  
 closed down for a long time.Then we   
 stopped at Pilgrims Lane,we were shown
 the levels of chalk and the tracks    
 where the railway had once been.The   
 Sand Martins had built their nests in 
 the holes of the sand.Then we were    
 shown a path which lead to marshy land
 and we saw some wild orchids and some 
 teasles.We looked over the cliff and  
 saw that the trees had taken over the 
 pit.
