		<content>   During its 25-year existence, Men-  
 with Hill Station has blended into the
 local community, both physically and  
 socially, being a valuable source of  
 local employment for the surrounding  
 villages, e.g., catering staff, build-
 ing work and casual labour. Security  
 at the base is administered by M.O.D. 
 police who live within the local area,
 along with a number of specialist     
 British personnel resident outside the
 station.                              
   Many U.S. families also choose to   
 live outside the base, their children 
 often attending local schools. They   
 are encouraged to participate fully in
 local entertainment and activities,   
 e.g., Rotary, Red Cross, local        
 charities, etc.                       
   The U.S. government contributes     
 to county government in lieu of rates 
 and receives local services.          </content>
