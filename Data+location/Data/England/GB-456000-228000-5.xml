      A battle of importance to the    
 villagers of Stoke Lyne (pop. 226) was
 fought and lost in spring 1985.       
 St. Peter's C. of E. School closed    
 after long deputations to the         
 Secretary of State for Education,     
 because of falling school rolls.  The 
 15 children are now "bussed" to       
 Fritwell, nearly four miles away.     
 Worried parents had pleaded that the  
 school was on the "wrong" side of the 
 proposed M40 Motorway extension.
