Recreation                             
   The best day of my life was when I  
went to Alton Towers with the Brownies 
and Joanna's mum took us on the Log    
Flume Ride and I was scared.    Wendy. 
                                       
   The day in my life came one day on  
holiday.It was in Wales. We had gone   
to Aberdaron. The waves were big. When 
we took our boats on the waves all we  
did was go up and down until a big     
wave came and knocked our boat over.   
Under we went but when it came up      
again we were still in the boat.   Sam.
                                       
Local history                          
    In 1711 Dr Johnson was brought as  
an infant to be treated by Dr Thomas   
Attwood who specialised as an oculist.
