		<title>15CHURCH AND RELIGION IN PLATT</title>
		<content>   St. Mary the Vigin Platt Church was 
built in 1853 in an Early English      
style.It has a square tower with a     
round turret and it faces east. It is  
built of Kentish Ragstone with clay    
tiles on the roof. It is the only place
of worship in Platt. It's present vicar
is the Rev. Robert Douglas. The seating
arrangement are chairs in rows. There  
are 9 stained glass windows and the    
organ was put in in 1984. Every Sunday 
there is a congregation of about 100.  
   In our survey we found that most    
people who did go to church were Church
of England. The are group 5-10 years   
had the most members of the Church of  
Enland. There are a few other religions
in Platt: Muslims, Roman Catholics and 
Methodists. Only 35% of people from    
Platt go to church regularly. 5% go    
only on special occasions and 60% never
go at all.                             </content>
