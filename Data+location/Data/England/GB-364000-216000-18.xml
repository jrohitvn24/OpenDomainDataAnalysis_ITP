		<title>18TOURISM IN MITCHELDEAN</title>
		<content>    Mitcheldean and Drybrook are in the
 Wyedean tourist area. Although there  
 are none of the major tourist         
 attractions for which the Wye Valley  
 and Forest of Dean are well known, the
 area has some very beautiful hill     
 country, and there are a few places   
 where provisions have been made for   
 tourists. The most important is at the
 top of Plump Hill, where a derelict   
 area around an old quarry is being    
 landscaped and reseeded, and provided 
 with parking and picnic areas. It is  
 hoped that this will remove some of   
 the pressure from the nearby nature   
 reserves around the ponds. The        
 Wilderness Countryside Trail also     
 starts in this area. Mitcheldean has a
 fine church, a tiny town hall, and    
 some interesting old houses, but the  
 Youth Hostel was demolished to widen  
 part of the High Street in 1984.      </content>
