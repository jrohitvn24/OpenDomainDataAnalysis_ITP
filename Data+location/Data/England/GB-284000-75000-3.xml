		<content>  we stop for lunch and the team which 
 is on duty lay the tables and when    
 they are ready they ring the bell and 
 we all go in and sit down then we have
 a grace.After the grace we go up to   
 the hatch when we are told and get our
 lunch.After lunch we go out to play   
 until one fifteen then we go indoors. 
 We are doing art and craft and we have
 to go indoors and sketch something in 
 the village then at three fifteen we  
 have to go indoors.Then we say a      
 prayer and go home.When I get home I  
 change  my clothes and play with my   
 friends on my bike.When I feel like it
 I go in for my tea and watch          
 television at about eight thirty I put
 my pyjamas on and go to bed where I   
 read a book until I feel sleepy.Then I
 turn my light off and go to sleep.
