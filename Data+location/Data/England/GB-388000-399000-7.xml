		<content>    The village of Littlemoss is       
 essentially a dormitory settlement for
 Droylsden and Manchester, but still   
 has a farming community at its heart. 
 One of the farms incorporates the     
 oldest building of the village. This  
 is{Cinderland Hall,}now a barn, but   
 thought to date back to the 17th      
 century.                              
    The early industry of the area has 
 disappeared now and traces remain only
 as road names. The flax industry      
 flourished here. It was grown on the  
 Moss (Marshland) and green allowed to 
 dry in stoops.  Today these locations 
 are remembered in the names{Greenside 
{Lane and Sunnyside Road. }Coal mining 
 took place near the Medlock Valley in 
 particular at{Daisy Nook}and near{Bell
{Clough}(from the bell pits).
