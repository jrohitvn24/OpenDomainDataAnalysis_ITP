		<content>{PIGS}Intensive  fattening unit  at Pen
 Barn has  6000  Large White X Landrace
 pigs in covered pens. Pigs are  bought
 as  40kg  weaners  from  Somerset farm
 owned by the same Family.    Cheese is
 made here and  Whey  byproduct sent by
 bulk tanker to Pen Barn for feeding to
 the pigs with Balancer meal: a mixture
 of wheat/barley/rapeseed/maize/gluten/
 minerals/vitamins &amp; copper for growth.
 NO growth-promotion steroids are used.
 Daily feed:   7500 galls Whey + 7 tons
 meal.    Weaners  fattened  to   100kg
 liveweight  &amp;  bought  as  baconers by
 Taunton Abattoir.    The type of breed
 and correct feeding  are essential  as
 carcasses   are  graded  and   payment
 depends on length and ratio of  fat to
 lean.   Average price is Â£75 per head.
 Effluent from unit sprayed over fields
 by   tractor - drawn  slurry   tankers
