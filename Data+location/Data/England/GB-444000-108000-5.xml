		<title>05West Wood Rubbish Tips.</title>
		<content>   In between the housing at Weston and
 the housing at Netley is a large open 
 space containing the area known as    
 West Wood.                            
   It sounds picturesque but in fact   
 for many years gravel was dug out from
 this area and the vast hole is being  
 filled in with{rubbish.               
   Actually part of the area has been  
 filled and some work has been done to 
 landscape the tip and make it into a  
 park.There is even talk of a Nine Hole
 Golf Course to be built here but at   
 the moment it seems to be only        
 talk.Who knows though in a few years  
 time everything might be different.   
  This could become a realy pleasant   
{leisure area.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
