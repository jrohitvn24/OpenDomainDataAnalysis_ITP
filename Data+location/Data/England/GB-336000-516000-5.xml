		<content> THE ONLY EXAMPLE OF EDUCATION IN OUR  
 VILLAGE IS OUR LITTLE SCHOOL. IT IS   
 CALLED PATTERDALE SCHOOL. THERE ARE   
 ONLY 21 CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL. WE    
 HAVE A BIG FIELD. THE SCHOOL IS AN OLD
 SCHOOL THAT HAS BEEN MODERNISED. THE  
 SCHOOL HAS A LOT OF P.E. EQUIPMENT AND
 IT IS ALL MODERN. THE SCHOOL IS ALSO  
 A CHURCH OF ENGLAND SCHOOL. NEXT DOOR 
 TO THE SCHOOL IS THE SCHOOL HOUSE     
 WHICH USED TO BE THE VILLAGE SCHOOL.  
 ALSO IN OUR AREA THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF
 OUTWARD BOUNDS SCHOOLS. ONE IS THE    
 PATTERDALE HALL AND ANOTHER IS THE    
 GEORGE STARKEY HUT. ALSO THERE IS A   
 MOUNTAIN CENTRE AT THE GREENSIDE      
 MINE,WHERE CHILDREN COME FOR ADVENTURE
 HOLIDAYS.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
