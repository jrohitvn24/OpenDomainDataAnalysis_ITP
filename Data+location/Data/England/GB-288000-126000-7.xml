		<content>     Farming at my home hardly ever    
 stops.Mum is up in the morning at six 
 o'clock and gets to bed nearly always 
 after midnight.There is always        
 something to do, whether it's mucking 
 out sheds, making concrete,doing up   
 old buildings or feeding the cows,    
 calves ,sheep,chickens,rabbits,gos    
 _lings and chicks.  Farming is good   
 fun most of the time,when it isn't    
 tipping down with rain.I have to do   
 the gardening in my spare time.We     
 usually make a garden in the corner of
 a field but this year the ploughed    
 field is so far away that I dug a     
 garden by the paddock.If we do get a  
 day when everything seems to be going 
 well then we go swimming, but that's  
 only once or twice a year.
