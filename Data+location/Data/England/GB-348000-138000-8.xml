		<title>08Midsummer in Glastonbury</title>
		<content> The two main cultural attractions of  
 the Glastonbury summer_ the{Pilton Pop
{Festival}and the{Summer Solstice      
 celebrations on the{Tor_}attract a    
 particular brand of visitor.These     
 celebrants are sometimes labelled     
 "hippies" by the indigenous population
 on the strength of their unorthodox   
 and colourful appearance. There are   
 several shops which cater for their   
 interests, selling vegetarian foods,  
 and others which sell books, pictures 
 and records, capitalising on their    
 taste for the mystical and legendary  
 stories which abound in Glastonbury.  
 When we questioned people in the town 
 about their attitude to the Pop       
 Festival, the reaction was mostly     
 positive. While condemning the much   
 publicised use of drugs on the site,  
 the advantages to the local youth, in 
 terms of entertainment, were welcomed.</content>
