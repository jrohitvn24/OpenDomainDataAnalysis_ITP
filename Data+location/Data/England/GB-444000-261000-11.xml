		<title>11HOMELIFE - DOMESTIC PETS</title>
		<content> We have got 57 pets. We have got 8    
 goats which live in a stable in Spring
 and in Summer they go out to eat      
 grass. At night they go in. We have   
 got one sheep and a ram, our ram bunts
 you when you go into the field. The   
 rabbits live in a cage, they eat      
 ferns, oats and dandelions. They go   
 out in the garden sometimes. Our      
 guinea pigs are in a cage, I feed     
 them in the morning and my sister     
 feeds them at night. The ducks, hens  
 and cockerels sleep in a pen. They    
 come out in the daytime; they eat     
 mash, oats and pellets. Our dogs sleep
 in the house, Rob is the biggest. Our 
 parrot talks sometimes and he lives in
 a cage. The hamsters live in a cage in
 the kitchen. On Monday I went to do   
 the animals, I did the chickens and   
 the cats. We took the dogs down the   
 field and my legs got very wet.       </content>
