		<content>   The walls began to bulge so were    
 supported by huge granite buttresses, 
 and more were added in l745. These are
 of blue granite (diorite).  In the    
 l9th century a new pulpit was given,  
 also more stained glass windows.  A   
 clock was placed in the tower to      
 commemorate Edward VII's coronation.  
 The west window in the south aisle was
 donated and a lovely brass lectern.   
 The walls were white washed and       
 electric lights were added in l939.   
 The church has a beautiful statue of  
 St. Martin sharing his cloak.
