		<title>11TARRANT MONKTON FARM-ANIMALS</title>
		<content> Mannor farm has 200 Friesian cows,a   
 Hereford bull and three horses.Mr     
 Bagwell keeps Friesians as they give  
 the most milk but not the most        
 quality.We went on the trailer to see 
 the milking parlour where the cows    
 were milked twice a day by machine    
 once at 5 am in the morning and again 
 at 3 pm in the afternoon.When the cows
 go into the milking parlour they stand
 in the stalls,the milker pulls a lever
 and food drops into a tray for each   
 cow.Then the milk suckers are put on  
 and they suck the milk out.The milk   
 is collected once a day by a tanker   
 lorry which takes it to Wincanton.When
 the cows are not much use for milking 
 they are taken to the cattle market   
 in Sturminster Newton and sold.
