		<title>02SAILING BASE (contd.)</title>
		<content> the sailing equipment is stored and a 
 modern brick building where you can   
 wash, and change your clothes.There is
 a small campsite with 2 man tents at  
 the edge of the base. The lake is     
 fairly large and is adequate for      
 sailing.At the rear of the lake there 
 is a large covert of trees.If you want
 refreshments there is a shop at the   
 base.Also there is a fairly large car 
 park at the front of the base.        
 At present it is under threat of      
 closure.
