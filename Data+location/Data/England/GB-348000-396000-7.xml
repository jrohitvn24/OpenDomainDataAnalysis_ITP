		<title>07Carmalite Convent Eccleston</title>
		<content> The Convent is 70 years old but the   
 Convent building is older. The wall is
 built of sandstone but they have      
 raised it. The nuns used to make robes
 for the priests at St.Julies church   
 but they don't anymore.Sister Michael 
 has been there the longest and is now 
 93 years old. There is a wooden statue
 which is only 4 months old and it was 
 put there by the sisters who pray four
 times a day. There are 13 nuns in the 
 convent. It has not been vandalised   
 but they put barbed wire around the   
 edge of the wall to stop young boys   
 climbing over. The nuns relatives can 
 visit. It has not suffered any damage.
 Where the convent used to be a house  
 called Springfield House. It was owned
 by the Greenall family and then they  
 sold it to the Cottoms who added a    
 wall in 1903 to 1904.
