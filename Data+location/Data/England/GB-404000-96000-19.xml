		<title>19LONGHAM_THE GREEK INFLUENCE</title>
		<content> The Kinson,Longham area is one not    
 normally associated with Foreign      
 influences.The nearby Bournemouth area
 is an all year round favourite with   
 tourists because of its mild climate  
 and beaches.Foreign visitors are      
 frequent but few settle to live in the
 area.                                 
    Longham was visited by a couple who
 had recently lost their holiday hotel 
 as a result of the Turkish invasion of
 Cyprus in 1974.The river,its swans,a  
 derelict building and an overgrown    
 site inspired the couple to settle    
 here and start anew in the hotel      
 trade.                                
    Local residents and visitors alike 
 may now join in Greek evenings,hear   
 Greek music and eat Greek food in the 
 heart of rural Dorset.
