		<title>14WHERE PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED</title>
		<content> Apart from villages and hamlets most  
 of the area is devoted to farmland.   
 There are about a dozen farms of      
 differing sizes part of whose land is 
 included in this area. The majority of
 the land which isn't woodland is used 
 for growing crops or keeping cows.    
 There are very few sheep here now. Few
 of the farms employ more then one     
 other person to work on them. They    
 are mostly family owned and worked.   
 Three of the farms are rented.        
 Other employment directly in the area 
 includes those who are self-employed. 
 Many of them are in the building trade
 like bricklayers, plumbers, carpenters
 etc.A few work locally in pubs and    
 shops. Most people who are in         
 employment in the area travel to the  
 nearby towns for their work. The area 
 contains a higher than average        
 retired population.                   </content>
