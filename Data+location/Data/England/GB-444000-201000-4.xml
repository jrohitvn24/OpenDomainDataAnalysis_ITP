		<content>     Under  the  Farm and Horticultural
 development  scheme  farmers have been
 encouraged  to  produce  a 6 year plan
 of  improvements  in  a  year  by year
 progression.    These   might  include
 installing  new  drainage or providing
 new equipment.  Approved plans gain an
 extra 10% grant from the E.E.C.       
     Bradley farm installed new milking
 parlours to increase its productivity.
 Now  milk  quotas have been introduced
 and  the  farmer  has been told to cut
 down his production, he feels that his
 investment has been wasted. Many dairy
 farmers  in  the surrounding area have
 taken {compensation} to  give  up milk
 production completely.                
     The  Common  Market's Intervention
 Scheme demands grain of a high quality
 and   the   authorities  are  slow  to
 complete  payments.   Selling  on  the
 open market is more attractive.       </content>
