		<title>13    KIRK IRETON WAKES</title>
		<content>  Wakes is a very old custom. People   
 used to watch in Church the night     
 before the Saint's Day to which the   
 church was dedicated. Kirk Ireton's   
 church is Holy Trinity, so Wakes Week 
 follows Trinity Sunday. On Trinity    
 Sunday people march behind the banner 
 of the Friendly Society to church.    
  There may be many different events   
 during the week, like a concert in the
 church, a treasure hunt, a disco, a   
 darts match and a cheese and wine     
 party. The main event takes place on  
 the Saturday. A decorated lorry       
 carries three Wakes Princesses from   
 the Primary school, followed by other 
 floats and people in fancy dress, in  
 procession round the village. There   
 are prizes for the best. The main     
 street is full of stalls and there are
 sideshows too. The children dance     
 round the maypole.                    </content>
