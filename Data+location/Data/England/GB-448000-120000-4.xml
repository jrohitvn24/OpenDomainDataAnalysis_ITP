		<content> The Chalk areas,in the main,have well 
 drained soils.They are used for arable
 farming,predominantly barley with oil 
 seed rape grown as a break crop.      
 However,the importance of dairying is 
 illustrated by the presence of        
 grassland in this area,particularly on
 the steeper slopes such as the dry    
 valley containing Hensting.           
 The relatively heavy soils of the     
 Tertiary clays are mainly in          
 grassland,again supporting dairying.  
 Woodland is relatively extensive in   
 the block.Almost all is deciduous and,
 in places,shows evidence of coppicing.
 There is little indication of any     
 intensive present-day management.     
 A small trout-farm exists at Fishers  
 Pond providing a link with the        
 medieval fishponds in the area.
