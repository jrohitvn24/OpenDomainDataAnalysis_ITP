		<title>13Transport in Solihull.</title>
		<content> From a survey we carried out we found 
 that the old and the young are the    
 people who regularly use the{bus      
{service.}Most people felt that the    
 prices were reasonable and that West  
 Midlands Passenger Executive who run  
 the buses provide a good service,but  
 several people were worried about     
 proposals that the bus service might  
 be privatised and that this would mean
 less frequent services on the less    
 popular routes.                       
 There is one{railway station}in our   
 area called Widney Manor,which has    
 been renovated and all the trains     
 from Leamington Spa now stop here as  
 well as other local trains.           
 The{car}is by far the most popular    
 form of transport.In our class of 28  
 every family had at least one car and 
 all the class expected to learn to    
 drive as soon as they were seventeen. </content>
