		<content>{SOFTBALL_}Two teams stand opposite    
 each other.One person from each team  
 goes behind the other team.Someone    
 throws the ball to the back person who
 then returns it.If two throws are     
 achieved without the ball bouncing the
 team can try to hit someone from the  
 opposite team below the knee.If they  
 do so the person who was hit joins    
 the back line.The team with the fewest
 people left are the losers.{LAST ONE  
{TO THE OAK TREE_}Last one to the oak  
 tree has been a unique and  popular   
 game in Condover for generations.It is
 played between a gate and an oak tree.
 Everyone rushes to the tree shouting  
 "last one to the oak tree is on it".  
 Who ever is last is "on".Everyone     
 runs to the gate which is "den" where 
 you are safe.If the chaser touches you
 you are "on" too.This continues until 
 everyone is"on" when we start again.  </content>
