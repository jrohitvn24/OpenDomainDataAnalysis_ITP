		<title>07The West Swindon Expansion</title>
		<content> During the 60's the Greater London    
 Council, Swindon Corporation and      
 Wiltshire County Council published the
{"Silver Plan"}proposing that the area 
 to the west of Swindon be extensivly  
 developed by the building of some     
{13,000}homes and widespread industrial
 areas. By 1985 the project resulting  
 from this report has changed the      
 expansion area beyond recognition and 
 angered many local people by the      
 planners apparent disregard for the   
 existing communities .                
 Swindon is currently the{fastest      
{growing town in the E.E.C.}and        
 thousands of people from around the   
 country have moved to find work at a  
 time of high unemployment. It will be 
 interesting to watch how the expansion
 fares when the building stops and to  
 see if the "invasion" has been        
 beneficial to West Swindon .          </content>
