		<title>08Landscape, Scoutmoor.</title>
		<content> The landscape of Scoutmoor is         
 predominantly hilly, and quite steep  
 in places. It is mainly desolate      
 moorland made up of poor rough grazing
 vegetation for rearing sheep. This is 
 broken by many dry stone walls and a  
 number of streams, one of which       
 trickles by the{Rossendale Way   }    
 footpath, on the summit of the moor,  
 another of which flows through a small
 valley lower down.                    
    At the top of the moor is the      
{Scoutmoor High Level Reservoir}which  
 was built by the Bury District Joint  
 Water Board between 1903 and 1910 and 
 is dated 1909.                        
    Over looking the main road through 
 Turn Village is  a large stone        
 quarry.Lower down is a water treatment
 works which has been surrounded by a  
 man made coniferous forest.
