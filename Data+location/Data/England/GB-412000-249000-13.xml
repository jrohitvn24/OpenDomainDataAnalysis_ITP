		<content>  Woodlands started in 1980 . They     
 employ 25 people fulltime and 10      
 partime .They grow over 500 different 
 types of plants.                      
  At any one time they are growing over
 1 million plants .The plants vary in  
 price from as little as 15p to Â£125.  
  They own another company called      
 Midland  Nursuries LTD which sells    
 most of their plants .They sell to    
 over 400 other companies from North of
 Aberdeen to South of Plymouth.They    
 also sell to councils and local       
 authorities.Spring is when they sell  
 60% of their plants.                  
  Many of their plants are grown in    
 pots and people plant them when new   
 shoots start to appear, when the      
 weather improves.                     
  Propagation is from cuttings which   
 are  rooted and cared for in a        
 special glass house.                  </content>
