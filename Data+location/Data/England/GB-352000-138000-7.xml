		<title>07SERVICES IN WEST PENNARD</title>
		<content>     For people in West Pennard,       
 Glastonbury (4km away) provides many  
 essential services. It is necessary to
 go to Glastonbury for the doctor,     
 dentist, policeman and fireman. Many  
 in the village must travel to towns in
 the area for employment since there   
 are few jobs in the village.          
    The only shop in the village is the
 small Post Office which stocks a wide 
 selection of essential goods. The     
 petrol stations also sell a few       
 items. The Post Office is a sorting   
 office for the 150-200 houses in the  
 village and it has its own postman.   
    Until 1972 West Pennard had a      
 policeman who also served Butleigh and
 Baltonsborough. The police station has
 been converted into a house.          
    West Pennard has its own resevoir  
 on the hill. It has mains electricity,
 water and sewerage but no piped gas.  </content>
