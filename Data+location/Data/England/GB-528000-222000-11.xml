		<title>11BENINGTON SCHOOL (2)</title>
		<content>It would accommodate 28 boys, 42 girls 
and 50 infants.                        
Today the name has changed to Benington
J.M.I. School but the building although
having undergone considerable structur-
al alterations and additions remains   
the only village school. Children enter
at Infant age and leave at the end of  
the School year when they attain the   
age of eleven. They continue their edu-
cation in the neighbouring Secondary   
Schools in Stevenage, travelling by    
School Bus. Benington School is a for- 
ward looking school, eagerly taking    
part in the village community at large.
The children, all from Benington, come 
to school either by car or by walking  
and after Daily Assembly go to their   
four classrooms for lessons. The staff 
consists of Headteacher and three other
Class Teachers, the Headteacher herself
teaching practically full time. (Cont.)</content>
