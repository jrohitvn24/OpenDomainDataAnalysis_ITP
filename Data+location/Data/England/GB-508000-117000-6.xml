		<title>06W.CHILTINGTON MEETEN'S MILL</title>
		<content>  {Meeten's Mill} was a smock mill and 
 it is now a house.The kitchen used to 
 be a grain store, the window is where 
 the door was for carts to load sacks  
 of flour.                             
   The mill used to be in{Monkmead}but 
 it was moved to the{Hollows}by horse  
 and cart in 1830. Three millers owned 
 the mill,{Mr.Hammond, then Mr.Willmer 
{and Mr.Meeten.                        
{  }The mill was made of sandstone for 
 2 metres and then timber. There was a 
 living room then up some wooden stairs
 was a bedroom. A door opened onto the 
 catwalk where people could mend or    
 adjust the sails. There are only 2    
 sails left now.                       
   The rooms got smaller and the stairs
 curved and wound. At the top the rooms
 sloped inwards. From the attic you    
 could see the sails. Out of a small   
 door was a little raft for the fan.   </content>
