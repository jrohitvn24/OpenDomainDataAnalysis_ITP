		<content>  The lady we interviewed at{Oddingley 
{Crossing}had lived there for four     
 years. She owns the house next door to
 the crossing, and works on a shift    
 every other two days. During a day    
 about fifty diesel engines come       
 through, both passenger and freight.  
 The points on the track are now       
 electric, and are now worked by the   
 Station at Gloucester. The crossing   
 has a phone which is a direct link to 
 Gloucester; it's an emergency phone   
 for special cases, for example,if a   
 train has broken down on the track.   
 While we were there, the{Signal+Tele- 
{Communications}were there, laying     
 wires which lead from Dunhampstead    
 Signal Box to Oddingley Level         
 Crossing. These men work in certain   
 areas, and their particular area was  
 from Swindon, Wilts to Herefordshire.
