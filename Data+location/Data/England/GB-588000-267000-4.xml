		<title>04A Typical Adults day</title>
		<content>I get up at 7.30, call the rest of the 
family and then we all have breakfast. 
My husband takes myself and our 2      
daughters to school on his way to work.
I am employed as an ancillary at Great 
Barton School and have various roles   
to perform. In the afternoon I go to   
Bury where I am a voluntary worker in a
Youth  Enquiry Shop, I try to help     
young people (14-26) with various pro- 
blems, and hopefully am of some use to 
them. At 3.00pm I catch a bus from Bury
which drops me outside the school in   
time to pick my 2 daughtersand take    
them home. At approx 5.30 my husband   
comes home from his job as a Community 
Education Officer, and we all have tea 
at 6.00pm. By 8.00pm my daughters are  
in bed and I have the last few hours of
my day just relaxing by reading a book 
of watching television. In the Summer I
spend most of my time in the garden.   </content>
