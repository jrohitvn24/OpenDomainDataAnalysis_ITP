		<content> Westmoor.During the summer months,    
 weather permitting, we swam in the    
 river.There were no local swimming    
 pools.We also spent a lot of our time 
 in Westmoor,where there were so many  
 things to discover-wild-life,plants   
 etc.We learned the art of jumping the 
 ditches with the use of a pole and    
 played games of hounds and hares.In   
 the winter the flood water which      
 always stayed on the moor for several 
 weeks,would freeze in the severe cold,
 and with the help of a broom handle   
 with a nail knocked in one end we     
 could skate across to Drayton copse.  
          Today many local children    
 still use the moor in their leisure   
 time.They go for walks with their     
 families and some fish in the ditches.
 Winter sliding is still enjoyed,but   
 there is far less flooding as a       
 pumping station has now been built.   </content>
