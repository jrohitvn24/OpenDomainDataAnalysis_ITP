		<title>13FARMING</title>
		<content>      Traditionally very small farms   
 with the North Devon ruby red         
 all-purpose cattle, a few pigs, and   
 the farmer's wife keeping some        
 poultry.  This was hard work for the  
 family but provided a good living, and
 the wife had the "perks" from her     
 weekly stall in Bideford market.      
      Since the last war the           
 introduction of machinery, modern     
 methods and fierce competition, have  
 forced many out of business.  The     
 successful farmers have survived by   
 enlarging their property up to l000   
 acres, either by buying adjoining     
 farms or not renewing tenancies when  
 they fall vacant.  This trend is      
 continuing.                           
      The EEC milk quota has caused    
 problems, but grass and cattle will   
 always be the major products.
