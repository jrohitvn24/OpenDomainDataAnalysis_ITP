		<title>01Broadhembury-North Hill</title>
		<content> Chief feature-North Hill, a ridge of  
 the Blackdown Hills which rises       
 steeply (very steeply near the top).  
 It is on 'greensand', is very boggy.  
 On top of North Hill is a very large  
 open plateau used as a Gliding Club.  
 On the west slope is a Rifle Range,   
 which ends at the 'common land'.  This
 goes from the bog to the top of the   
 hill, and is dotted which old         
 Whetstone pits and holes from which,  
 earlier in the century, road stone was
 taken.  The block contains no villages
 (only half of Kerswell, a hamlet of 36
 or so houses), but one of the         
 village's working farms comes within  
 this area.  There are about ten       
 largish farms with a cottage or two   
 and a main farm house.  Farming is    
 mainly dairy-with-cereal-and/or roots 
 or sheep-and-pigs-with-roots.         
 chickens kept are mostly for local use</content>
