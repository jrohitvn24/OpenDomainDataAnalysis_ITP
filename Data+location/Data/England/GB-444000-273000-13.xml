		<content> My dad's hobby is collecting beer     
 cloths and beer glasses.He keeps the  
 beer cloths all over his bedroom wall 
 and the glasses he keeps in the living
 room cabinet.He likes to collect these
 things because one Christmas someone  
 gave him a beer glass as a present and
 he has been collecting them ever      
 since.                                
  He started to collect the beer cloths
 because he thought his bedroom looked 
 bare,so he wanted something colourful 
 to put on them.His first cloth came   
 from a bar at the club of Towcester   
 Town football supporters club,there he
 saw the barman putting the glasses on 
 a very interesting beer cloth  and    
 persuaded him to let him have one.    
 After this his collection has grown so
 that all four bedroom walls are       
 covered now.They are often given him  
 as presents.                          </content>
