		<content>The aerodrome has been deserted since  
the Second World War. It looks like a  
ghost town from a cowboy movie, mounds 
of earth over the concrete runway,     
plastic bags being blown about in the  
wind, grass growing through the        
different colours of the worn out      
runway. Today ox-eye daisy, cranes     
bill, moss and yorkshire fog grow      
there.                                 
Many years ago the ruined red brick    
control tower may have looked like a   
fire station practice tower. Once      
there would have been a radar and      
radio in the glass top. The stairs     
inside the control tower has seen      
better days, once looking  like a      
metal fire escape, now rusted through. 
The aerodrome is now peaceful, with    
birds twittering instead of the roar   
of aeroplanes.                         
                                       </content>
