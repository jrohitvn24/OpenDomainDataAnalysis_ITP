		<title>03Where People Work.</title>
		<content> There are not many places of          
 employment in our block,so few people 
 work here.                            
 The places of employment in our block 
 are: B.Walker &amp; Co. (Builders)        
 Hairdresser. Owlpen Manor. Uley       
 School. Most people live in Uley but  
 work away. Out of thirty eight people 
 surveyed,only six worked in our block.
 This is because most of the jobs here 
 are taken or the place doesn't need   
 people.                               
 Seeing that Uley is just a village and
 our block is rural it has quite a few 
 places of employment.However,most of  
 them are part_time so most people work
 somewhere else.                       
 Some common work places are Berkeley, 
 Bristol and Dursley. Only one person  
 worked in London. This is surprising  
 as London is at least one and three   
 quarter hours drive from here.        </content>
