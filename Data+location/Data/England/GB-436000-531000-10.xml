		<title>10LOCAL FARMING SUMMARY.</title>
		<content> THE MAJORITY OF THIS D BLOCK IS RURAL.
 AND SO THE MAIN INDUSTRY IS{FARMING.  
 THERE ARE {18}FARMSTEADS IN THE AREA  
 COVERED,AND MOST OF THESE ARE THESE   
 ARE{MIXED FARMS}WITH SOME{DAIRY FARMS.
{ANIMALS REARED ARE CHIEFLY,}DAIRY     
 CATTLE, AND SHEEP. THE MAIN{CROPS}ARE 
 CEREALS, WHEAT, BARLEY, OATS, POTATOES
 AND INCREASINGLY,OILSEED RAPE. BECAUSE
 MOST OF THE FARMS REAR ANIMALS,SOME OF
 THE LAND IS GIVEN OVER TO THE GROWING 
 OF GRASS FOR{FODDER CROPS}SUCH AS     
 SILAGE AND HAY. OUR LAND COVER SURVEY 
 SHOWED THAT THE FARMS IN THE NORTH OF 
 THE BLOCK ARE TYPICAL SMALL MIXED     
 FARMS, WHICH HAVE CHANGED LITTLE, BUT 
 THE FARMS IN THE SOUTH EAST OF THE    
 BLOCK HAVE BEEN JOINED TOGETHER,      
 HEDGES HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT TO MAKE THE
 FIELDS LARGER. THESE HAVE THEN BEEN   
 PLANTED WITH THE 3 MAIN{CEREALS.
