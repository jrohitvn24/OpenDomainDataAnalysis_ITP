 Hallow village. Many people take part 
 in the celebrations for{May Day}most  
 important are the children from{Hallow

 that as a church of England school,   
 the children celebrate the church's   
{patronal festival}day too, that of St 
 James and St Philip.They attend  a    
 sevice  in the church after which they
 are provided with a tea in the village
 hall along with the Sunday School     
 children,the{May Queen}and her        
 attendents.After this they walk to the
 Village Green and there they make a   
 guard of honour for the{May Queen}who 
 has been chosen from the Sunday       
 School. After the{May Queen}is crowned
 the children dance round the{Maypole  
 making colourful patterns with the{May
{pole}ribbons.The boys do{Morris
