		<content>craft,only rarely is it that fishermen 
have to be rescued.Most are because    
of engine trouble or the pleasure      
craft does not know the area or        
tides. Mr. Taylor's family has been    
with lifeboats for 350 years.His most  
memorable moment was just after The    
Second World War when the whole        
lifeboat crew were Taylors.to Mr.Taylor
just saving someones life is memorable.
   Every so often an inspector comes   
round to inspect the whole station to  
make sure it is all in top condition.  
The natural features of the area hinder
the rescues.The piers have changed the 
tides of the area.The tides run        
parallel with the coast.The current    
goes out faster than it comes in so    
this means the lifeboat can get out to 
sea quicker with this tide but the     
current is dangerous for bathers.
