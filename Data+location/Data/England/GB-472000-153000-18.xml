		<title>18HOOK COMMUNITY CENTRE DOUBTS</title>
		<content> Hook Parish Council has clashed with  
 developer Charles Church over the much
 needed Â£185 000 Community Centre,to be
 built in Holt Lane on 2 acres of land 
 donated as part of a planning deal.   
 Angry councillors were told 5.5 acres 
 alongside,needed to finally complete  
 the scheme,were no longer guaranteed. 
 The developer also demanded that the  
 2.2acres now on offer must quickly be 
 accepted or it could be built on.Amid 
 talk of being railroaded and squeezed 
 the dilemma was discussed.The Council 
 must shortly acquire title on the 2.2 
 acres or lose a Â£50000 H.C.C.grant and
 risk delaying the project a year.The  
 deal rests on a settlement about the  
 Hook By-Pass between Charles Church,  
 Davis Estates and Hart Council.People 
 interviewed in Hook wondered if there 
 would ever be any community facilities
 or just many more profitable houses.  </content>
