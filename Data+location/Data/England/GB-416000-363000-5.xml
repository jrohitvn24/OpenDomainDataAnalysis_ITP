		<content> The region is characterised by high   
 limestone grasslands rolling gently   
 downwards towards the east and        
 bordered north and south by two dales 
 whose steep sided valleys and clear   
 streams are only visible at close     
 quarters.                             
 The altitude of the land, the cool and
 damp climate, pastoral farming and    
 mining and quarrying both past and    
 present have all combined to provide a
 unique national landscape.            
 Of immediate note to the outsider is  
 the large variety of mature deciduous 
 trees, rare wild flowers such as      
 cowslip, mountain pansey, lily of the 
 valley and maiden pink and varied     
 wildlife including peregrin falcons,  
 badgers and trout. This year has been 
 particularly wet and the landscape has
 retained its springlike apparel       
 throughout the summer.                </content>
