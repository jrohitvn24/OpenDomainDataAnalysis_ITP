		<content>    The Ecology of Severn Stoke is     
 closely interwoven with the regime of 
 the {River Severn.}There have been    
 many floods this century, the most    
 severe of which was in 1947, when the 
 water level was over the counter of   
 the Rose &amp; Crown pub (4' above ground 
 level)! St. Deny's church is one of   
 the few churches in England liable to 
 flooding, although it is on slightly  
 higher ground and is usually          
 unaffected.                           
    The{soil structure}of the area is a
 loam of gravel and clay with keuper,  
 with a sub_soil of marl and alluvium. 
    There is a long footpath beside the
 river and another leading up to Severn
 Bank House.                           
    There is no real source of         
{pollution}in the area, except when the
 traffic on the M5 is at a standstill.
