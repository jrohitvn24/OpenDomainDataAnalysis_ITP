		<content>  There is  no{police station}in       
 Lapford although there used to be a   
 police house.It was closed down some  
 years ago because it did not get used 
 enough.Sometimes a {policeman}comes in
 a police car and stays down the       
 village by the old peoples            
 bungalows.The main crime in the       
 village is burglaries.A{policeman}    
 comes to the school to talk to the    
 children about the green cross code   
 and not talking to strangers,riding on
 a bicycle and lots of other things.The
 school has been burgled three times in
 the last four years.If a policeman is 
 needed,you have to phone              
 Credition.There is very litte {       
{vandalism }in the village yet some    
 villages have a vandalism problem.
