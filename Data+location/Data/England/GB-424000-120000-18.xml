		<content> In our Domesday area there are a lot  
 of plantations of trees.The spruce    
 trees are close together and it is    
 very dark in between the trees,so no  
 wild life is under the trees but the  
 trees grow quicker because the trees  
 grow up to the light.Trees are felled 
 by men for the cones which hold       
 seeds.The cones are put into an oven  
 to make them open up quickly.The trees
 are felled and taken  away by a lorry 
 to a sawmill .In our area we have a   
 three sawmills. When the seeds have   
 grown a man plants them. One man can  
 plant 600 a day with an auger.The     
 auger is a long pipe with a point on  
 the end,the plant is put into the     
 ground. A variety of trees grow in    
 the area including Metasequoia and    
 Copper beech, which were planted in   
 the Melchet estate.Landford Lodge is  
 today a nursery for deciduous trees.  </content>
