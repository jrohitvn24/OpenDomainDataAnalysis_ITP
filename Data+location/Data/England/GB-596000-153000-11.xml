		<title>11THROWLEY LOCAL GOVERNMENT</title>
		<content> Local government in Throwley is admin 
 istered by the Kent County Council.   
 Local affairs are considered by the   
 parish council.An extra penny rate    
 pays for local projects.              
  Recent work has included a wooden    
 seat at the  Forstal and a new notice 
 board.Some of the silver birch trees  
 have been thinned out,and pot holes   
 filled in paths after the severe      
 winter.The proposal to erect a        
 lamp at the Park Terrace car park     
 was rejected because of the cost.The  
 village was entered for The Best Kept 
 Village competition,but was unplaced. 
   Local applications for planning     
 permission are considered by the      
 parish council.No new buildings are   
 permitted in the conservation area.   
  Problems considered have been the    
 stubble burning by farmers,and the    
 aerial spraying of crops.             </content>
