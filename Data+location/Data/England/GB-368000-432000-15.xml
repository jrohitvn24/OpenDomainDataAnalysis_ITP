		<title>15Housing around Langho</title>
		<content>     Old housing in the area is related
entirely to farming ; larger farm      
houses with small labourers cottages . 
There were subsequent develovments of  
terraced cottages for workers in small 
mills or in quarring . Now a majority  
of cottages have been improved to      
become homes for commuters . Most of   
the early housing is of stone , the    
cottages frequently being of the 2 up 2
down type , well finished at the front 
but often of random stone at the rear .
    Since 1950 a mixture of "middle    
class " housing has being built ,      
virtually all privately owned and of a 
variety of types , much of it on small 
estates . Dwellings range from standard
smallhouse types to individually       
designed properties .
