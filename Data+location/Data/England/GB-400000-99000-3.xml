		<content>   Wimborne is full of local history.  
 In the older part of Wimborne is the  
 Quarter Jack toy shop.  It is one     
 of the biggest toy-shops in Dorset    
 and it is in East Street which is     
 the road which leads up to the        
 Minster.  Wimborne Square has older   
 shops too and there are lots of banks 
 where we keep our money.  There are   
 also bus stops where buses pick people
 up.  Near the Square is the Priest's  
 House Museum and there is also a      
 tourist information office where you  
 can find things out.  The Square is   
 very busy and has a big hotel called  
 The King's Head Hotel.  The Old Mill  
 (now a new Restaurant) near the River 
 Allen was mentioned in the original   
 Domesday Book.  The old Queen         
 Elizabeth Grammar School has now been 
 divided into flats.
