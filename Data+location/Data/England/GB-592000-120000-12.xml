		<title>12Arts and Crafts in Rye</title>
		<content>  In Rye there are many artists and    
 craftsmen. Many show their work in Rye
 Gallery. Four artists' work is shown  
 each month. They have to be           
 professional, but once a year art from
 the local Comprehensive school is also
 shown. There is also an annual        
 exhibition for amateur artists held   
 elsewhere in the town. There has      
 recently been a series of programmes  
 on television about the large         
 community of artists and craftsmen who
 live in and around Rye.               
  Rye is also well known for its       
 potteries which are a great attraction
 to the tourists. Pottery has been     
 produced in Rye for several hundred   
 years, and examples going back to the 
 14th century are on show in the       
 museum.
