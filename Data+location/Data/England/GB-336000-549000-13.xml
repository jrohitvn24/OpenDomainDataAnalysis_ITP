		<title>13Interview with Canon Kelly.</title>
		<content> Canon Kelly is our vicar. We asked him
 what will happen to preaching in the  
 future. Mr Kelly thinks that there    
 will be alot of lady vicars in the    
 next 20,30 years.He says he doesn't   
 think the style of clothes will change
 for preaching very much,but if he had 
 a choice he would wear clothes that   
 are more simple and colourful.        
 He said some churches are already     
 using pop music to sing to and he     
 wouldn't mind if they used pop music  
 in his church and he says he agrees   
 with pets in church.The services might
 change a bit but they have only just  
 changed in 1980.The services will just
 last the same length of time.He said  
 he wouldn't like to see any new       
 changes to the outside of the church  
 but he would like a tapestry on the   
 west wall inside the church.
