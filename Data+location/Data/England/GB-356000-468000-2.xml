		<title>02 Hornby in the Past.</title>
		<content>Once Hornby was engaged in the mining  
of coal. The old Toll House (now a     
petrol station) 2 km. South of the     
village marks the boundary of the coal 
field.                                 
Hornby has retained its feudal-style   
appearance;houses which once belonged  
to tenants and estate workers,together 
with the parish church and the Castle  
Hotel, which was once the local        
coaching inn, are clustered below the  
hilltop castle.                        
At the Northern end of the village is  
Castlestede, said to be the best       
example of a Motte and Bailey in the   
county and the suggested site of the   
original castle in Hornby, built by    
Horn, a Saxon chief, after whom the    
village takes its name.                
Today, few inhabitants work in the     
village. Most people commute to their  
place of work.                         </content>
