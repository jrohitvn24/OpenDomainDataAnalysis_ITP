		<title>03Stretton Sugwas Gravel Pit</title>
		<content> The pit is operated by Amey Roadstone 
 Corporation (ARC), a subsidiary of    
 Consolidated Goldfields International,
 on land owned by the Prudential       
 Assurance Company. The deposits are of
 glacial origin. There is no blasting: 
 materials are extracted by dragline   
 and processed on site to produce      
 medium and fine sand and gravel. The  
 products are distributed widely, some 
 to the building industry and some to  
 roadworks. Extraction has gone on here
 since the 193Os, but because of the   
 nature and origin of the deposits no  
 reliable estimate exists of how long  
 extraction will be profitable. A      
 separate company producing ready-mixed
 concrete is sited at the pit for ease 
 of access to the requisite materials. 
 The total site covers about 16O acres.
 Some reclaimed land has been rented to
 a local farmer.                       </content>
