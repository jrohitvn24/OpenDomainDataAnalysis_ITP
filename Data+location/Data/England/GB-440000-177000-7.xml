		<content> Woolley Park is a large country estate
 and country house not open to the     
 public used as a farm. The owners have
 lived in the area for a very long time
 and at one time owned most of the area
 around Brightwalton. It is through    
 them that All Saints church and the   
 school were built in the village. The 
 parkland is used as intensively       
 managed grazing land and has not been 
 ploughed for many years. There are    
 some Roe Deer in the park as well     
 though not often seen as they tend to 
 keep to the woods.
