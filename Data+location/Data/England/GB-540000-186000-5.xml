 Ilford should worry about vandalism,  
 the elderly, pollution and buildings. 
 Vandalism is a problem in Ilford.     
 Shops and small businesses are burgled
 quite frequently. An increase in      
 muggings is also causing concern, as  
 is graffiti and damage to property.   
 Ilford is a busy town and pollution   
 from smoke causes problems. There is a
 lot of litter in Ilford but our       
 dustmen do a very good job in clearing
 it. More hospitals, fire and police   
 stations are needed, as are toilets   
 for the disabled. We trust that during
 the redevelopment, ramps will be      
 included to allow people in           
 wheelchairs to enter buildings and    
 cross roads more easily.Better traffic
 signals are needed to help the blind  
 person cross more easily.             </content>
