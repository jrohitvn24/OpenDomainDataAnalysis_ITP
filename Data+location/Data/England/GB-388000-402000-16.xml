		<content>   In this area there is always a shop 
 within easy reach. Many of the shops  
 are mixed goods shops selling a wide  
 variety of things. If we wanted to buy
 a common thing, such as milk or       
 butter, there are a number of shops in
 which we could buy it locally. If it  
 was less common, or more expensive,   
 such as furniture, then we would      
 usually have to go further. But there 
 are also some specialist shops in the 
 area. There is a knitting machine shop
 which is the only shop of its kind for
 miles around and which attracts       
 customers from all over the town.     
 People come to this shop to take      
 lessons on the knitting machines.
