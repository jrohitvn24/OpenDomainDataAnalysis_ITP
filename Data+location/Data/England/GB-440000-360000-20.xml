		<title>20THE TIBSHELF/HOLMEWOOD TRAIL</title>
		<content> The Tibshelf to Holmewood Trail was   
 opened in 1984. It is intended for    
 walkers, cyclists and horse riders.   
 For most of its length it follows the 
 course of the disused railway,        
 beginning at Tibshelf close to the    
 site of the old station.The trail is  
 a useful resource for environmental   
 studies and will become increasingly  
 important as it settles and develops. 
 A group of children walked along the  
 first mile of the trail from Tibshelf.
 They identified 14 species of bird, 9 
 kinds of tree and 7 kinds of flower.  
 The large variety of weeds and grasses
 were harder to identify but these,    
 together with the fungi, should       
 provide fascinating areas of study.   
 Insects and very small creatures      
 (spiders, worms, slugs, snails, etc.) 
 are plentiful but more difficult to   
 observe.                              </content>
