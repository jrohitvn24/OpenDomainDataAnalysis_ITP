 The A5 travels from London to         
Holyhead.It is partly dual and partly  
single carriageway. The A5 is a very   
busy road because people use it to get 
to work. There are pavements both sides
 of the road. Four out of five drivers 
are men. Out of all the cars the Ford  
Cortina was the most popular make. The 
'U' (1979\80) registration was most    
common. The oldest registration was a  
car registered 'D' (1965\66). On       
average a car passed every 6 seconds.  
there were 281 cars.                   
 Of all the lorries passing, most were 
carrying building material. Tamworth   
is a growing town.
