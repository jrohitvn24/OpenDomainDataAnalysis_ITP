		<title>05ST. MARGARETS CHURCH</title>
		<content> ST. Margaret's has got a mural on the 
 west wall. The mural has been there   
 since the twelfth century, but was    
 only rediscovered in 1970. The church 
 was burnt down in 1155 and rebuilt in 
 1215. The new building was much larger
 than the old.                         
                                       
 There are 14 services a week. The     
 congregation for a Sunday morning     
 service does occasionally reach sixty.
 A majority of the congregation come   
 from outside East Wellow. The church  
 attracts between two to three thousand
 visitors a year. They come from all   
 over the world mainly to see the      
 family grave of Florence Nightingale, 
 the heroine of the Crimean War.       
                                       
 Volunteers clean the church, tidy the 
 graveyard and arrange the flowers.
