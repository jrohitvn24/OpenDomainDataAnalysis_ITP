		<title>07YOUTH IN JERSEY</title>
		<content>   There is nothing much to do in the  
 area that we live in apart from Youth 
 Clubs which are mostly on Friday      
 nights.                               
   Most weekends we travel into town   
 and spend our time in youth clubs     
 there, or walking round town. We also 
 spend our evenings in town as well. We
 also organise our own parties when one
 of us has the house free. They usually
 last until about eleven or twelve     
 o'clock and any thing goes. In the    
 summer there are more parties than    
 usual because people organise beach   
 parties which usually go on until     
 early morning. We have these parties  
 because there is nothing else to do   
 around our area for people of our age.
   Being a young teenager in Jersey is 
 difficult, because we are too young to
 get into pubs or nightclubs.
