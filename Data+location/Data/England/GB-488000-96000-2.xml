		<title>02PAGHAM PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Reverend Maynard showed us around 
 the church.  There has been a church  
 on the site for over 1000 years, going
 back to Saxon times.  In 1929 {Queen  
{Mary}went to the church when{King     
{George V}was recovering at Craigwell  
 House from an illness.  It was after  
 his stay that the king agreed to      
 adding Regis to the town's name.  Some
 of the services held at Pagham are    
 very different to those in 1929, but  
 Matins is almost the same.            
 The{inside of the church}has changed  
 quite a lot in the 15 years since     
 Mr.Maynard came.  There is some new   
 flooring and new carpeting in the     
 sanctuary.  The box pews that the     
 Queen used have been moved to the back
 of the church.  The pipe organ has    
 been replaced by an electronic one,   
 the altar moved forward and the font  
 moved to the north transept.          </content>
