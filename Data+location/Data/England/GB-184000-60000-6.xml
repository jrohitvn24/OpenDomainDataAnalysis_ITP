 By the side of the road, in the hedge,
 there are a lot of wildflowers and    
 insects.Some of the dominant types of 
 plant are foxglove and cowparsley.The 
 hedgerows are not cut too regularly   
 so preserving an abundance of plant   
 and animal life.The roads are not very
 busy and there are barely any houses  
 or buildings in or near{RIALTON BARTON
 and there is much rough grazing       
 land.                                 
    At{TREWASSICK}the barns are being  
 developed and repaired.Some cottages  
 which are Duchy property are being    
 bought by people who would rather     
 live in the countryside than the town.
 Although they would be about 2 miles  
 from Newquay they would not see many  
 cars or people on the road even in the
 holiday season.                       </content>
