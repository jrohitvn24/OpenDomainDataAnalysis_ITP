		<content> We have 12 teachers at Swillington    
 School, including headmaster. There   
 are 9 classes, 5 junior and 4 infant. 
 We don't have any particular uniform  
 but we are not allowed to wear        
 make-up, very high heeled shoes or    
 dangly earings. We seem to have quite 
 alot of rules, but the teachers assure
 us that we don't. Here are a few:-    
 1.Don't run in class or down the      
 corridor. 2.Don't eat in the          
 classroom. 3.Don't go out of school   
 grounds in school time. 4.Don't go in 
 the classroom when a teacher isn't    
 there. School on the whole is quite   
 enjoyable. Drama is the most favoured 
 lesson in my class. We usually do     
 concerts at the end of the year for   
 parents. Sometimes we put plays on at 
 Christmas. We can't put an end of term
 play on this year because of the      
 teachers' dispute.                    </content>
