		<content> People in this category live in       
 specially designed bungalows with one 
 or two bedrooms. The bungalows are    
 arranged around a courtyard with a    
 communal garden which is tended by the
 local authority. The occupants of the 
 bungalows are visited daily by a      
 warden who checks their welfare and   
 will call a doctor if needed or do the
 shopping if they cannot get out. Milk,
 newspapers and post are delivered     
 daily and the rent is collected weekly
 by a collector. Some residents who are
 very old or disabled have a home help.
 That is a lady who does the household 
 chores. Close by thereis a community  
 centre for the residents where they   
 can, meet, chat and play bingo,       
 dominoes and cards. Most residents    
 enjoy their new homes because they    
 have companionship and feel secure    
 with a warden looking after them.     </content>
