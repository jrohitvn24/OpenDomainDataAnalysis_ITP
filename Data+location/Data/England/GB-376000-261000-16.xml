		<title>16LITTLE WITLEY CIDER GROWING</title>
		<content>{  Cider apples}are grown extensively  
 on farms within this area. Planting   
 has taken place during the last decade
 and trees are currently reaching full 
 productivity. All are owned by        
 H.P.Bulmer Ltd of Hereford.           
  {Orchard management}is of a very high
 standard using all modern production  
 and harvesting methods. Orchards are  
 grassed and this is controlled by     
 frequent mowing. Herbicide is applied 
 to control weeds and grass in tree    
 rows. Regular sprays of insecticide   
 and fungicide ensure clear crops.     
 Biennial bearing is evident, trees    
 carry heavy crops in their "on" year  
 and much lighter crops in their "off".
  {Harvesting}is by mechanical shaker, 
 apples being then blown into windrows 
 and finally lifted by machine into    
 tractors and taken to collecting      
 points for delivery to the factory.   </content>
