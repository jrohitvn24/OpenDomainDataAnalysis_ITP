		<title>14 Communications in Wellow</title>
		<content>The main road in this area is the A36. 
It is a major road and the amount of   
traffic it carries is considerable,    
making it hazardous to even walk on the
single pavement.It would be better if  
the road was made into a dual carriage 
way.This road goes from Southampton    
to Salisbury with many minor roads     
branching from it, linking Canada and  
Wellow to the A36.These are also very  
busy;many of the roads have a pavement 
on one side only.Some of the out lying 
areas are linked by footpaths and      
bridleways.Many of these are           
signposted.Some paths  are very        
overgrown through lack of use and are  
hard to walk along.Because they are not
used frequently some stiles were in a  
dangerous condition.                   
  Generally,Wellow is well served by   
roads.
