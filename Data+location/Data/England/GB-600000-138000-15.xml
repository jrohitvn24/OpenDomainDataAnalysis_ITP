 A TYPICAL DAY _ School begins at 9.00,
 many children meeting on the          
 playground beforehand. The day begins 
 with registration, followed by an     
 Assembly. Children often accompany    
 hymns with recorder or percussion     
 work. During the day there is often an
 opportunity for watching educational  
 films on projector, slides, filmstrips
 or a T.V. Programme for Schools. Lunch
 is taken in the School Hall, some     
 children bringing a packed lunch, some
 taking advantage of the County scheme.
 The afternoon may see groups having   
 games on the field or playground.     
 After school there may well be some   
 club activity in due season _         
 football, netball, tennis, badminton, 
 table tennis _ other clubs operate at 
 lunch_time.
