		<title>05Lactation Time.</title>
		<content> The busiest time for Mr. Kynaston is  
 in May.This means they have had calves
 and are producing more milk for       
 them.So they have to be milked three  
 times a day,at 6 o'clock a.m. ,3      
 o'clock p.m. and 10 o'clock p.m.They  
 have five lactations in a life time.  
     If a bull is born it is fattened  
 up for a year and then sold to be     
 slaughtered for meat.If a dairy cow is
 born it will be added to the herd and 
 kept for milking.                     
     The milk is sold to Express       
 Dairies at Ruyton XI Towns.Mr.        
 Kynaston is paid between 11-17 pence  
 per litre of milk.                    
     The farm is quite large consisting
 of four hundred acres.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
