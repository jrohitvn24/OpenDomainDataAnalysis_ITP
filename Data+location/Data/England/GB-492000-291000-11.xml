		<content> here are no recreational facilities in
 ither Deene or Deenethorpe, but there 
are facilities for leisure at Priors   
Hall Golf Course,in the south of the   
study area...where there are bars and a
restaurant, in addition to the golf    
club.                                  
Until the 1970's there was a public    
house at Deene (The Seahorse),and this 
became a club before closing. Some     
residents believed there was a need for
the pub to re-open, but this seems to  
be unlikely.                           
The nearest recreational facilities    
are at Corby,and in the nearby villages
of Weldon and Bulwick.                 
Only one person interviewed had been to
the theatre in the past year, three had
been to a sporting event...and two said
they had not been away from their own  
village for more than a few hours in   
the past five years.                   </content>
