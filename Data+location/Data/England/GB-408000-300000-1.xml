		<content> The area is crossed by a Roman road   
which leads to the Roman baths at Wall 
a few miles north.  The road is not    
continuous now but several sections are
followed by modern roads.              
 Remains of mills and mill ponds can be
seen.                                  
 Two families have left their names on 
the map.The Badgers in Badgers Bank    
Road, and the Bickleys on a plaque at  
the end of Clarence Road. This says:   
"Here on the first of August 1797      
John Bickley and the horse which he    
rode were struck dead by lightning.    
Happily he was an amiable youth".      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
