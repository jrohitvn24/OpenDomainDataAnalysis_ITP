		<title>14Event (Harold Courts School)</title>
		<content> In June 1982 the 'Friends of Harold   
 Court School' Association decided to  
 build a school library.The Association
 had to raise all the money as the     
 Authority were unable to help.The     
 eventual cost was Â£9,300.Nearly Â£6,700
 was raised from school events.The rest
 was donated.                          
 In June 1983 plans were drawn and by  
 July 1983 building permission was     
 granted.On March 10th 1984 the        
 building work began.To keep costs down
 most of the work was done by parent   
 volunteers and staff who gave up their
 weekends.                             
 By April 1985 the library was finished
 complete with carpet,gas fires,books  
 and lighting.The Mayor of Havering    
 opened it officially in May.A         
 celebration was held next day when    
 teachers and pupils dressed as book   
 characters.                           </content>
