		<title>01Wrentham Village</title>
		<content> Wrentham is a village situated on the 
 A 12 between Lowestoft and Ipswich.   
 Although the population is relatively 
 small there is a large number of small
 businesses.                           
   There is also a surprising range of 
 activities both for adults and        
 children.                             
   The village is likely to change in  
 character when a by-pass is built     
 diverting through- traffic away from  
 the village centre.                   
   You will be able to find more about 
 our village in the pages which follow.
 We have tried to write about things   
 which we know about but which you     
 might find difficult to find out about
 anywhere else.
