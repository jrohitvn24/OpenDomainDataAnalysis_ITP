		<title>10 The Local Doctor</title>
		<content>From 1840 until 1979, the Doctor in    
Waterhouses has been a Doctor Hall.    
Four generations of this family have   
been the sole practitioner, covering an
area of some 200 sq. miles.            
Dr. A.G. Hall qualified as a Doctor at 
Manchester University and took over his
father's practice in 1941. The biggest 
changes he has seen in 38 years are in 
the manner of practising and the major 
causes of death. At first most patients
were visited by the doctor in their own
homes and if medicines were necessary  
attended a surgery in the Doctor's     
house. Nowadays the majority of        
patients visit the Doctor at the       
surgery on Waterfall Lane built in     
1975. In the early 1940's major causes 
of death were diptheria, influenza and 
pneumonia. Now people live longer and  
the major causes of death are heart    
disease and cancer.                    </content>
