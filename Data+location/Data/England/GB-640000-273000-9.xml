St Peter's Church, Thorington.         
At the west end is a partly            
Saxon round tower in uncoursed flint   
with round headed arcading an windows  
in the upper section. The church is    
pre-conquest in origin with a narrow   
nave and chancel. The nave was later   
widened by reducing the wall thickness 
inside to a height of two metres, thus 
adding 50 cms to the width.            
St Peter's Church Wenhaston            
Almost the whole church is built of    
flint, with some of the facings being  
knapped. The major construction is 14th
century, but there are portions of the 
nave dating back to the late 11th c.   
The great feature of the church is the 
painted medieval Doom(judgement scene) 
on  board. Fine Stuart pulpit.
