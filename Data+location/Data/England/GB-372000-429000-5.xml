    Rishton is a town which developed  
with the growth of the Lancashire      
textile industry. Mills were built     
alongside the canal for easy transport-
ation of goods.                        
   In 1985 nothing is left of the      
textile industry and very little of the
mills. These have been replaced by     
light industry housed in converted or  
prefabricated premises and employing   
few workers. The largest area of       
employment is the retail trade, with   
shops in the High Street. There is also
a large pet food manufacturer, a carpet
factory and a timber yard as well as   
several service industries. Most of the
industry is located near the town      
centre but recently there has been a   
move back towards the canal.
