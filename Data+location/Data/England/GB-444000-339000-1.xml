		<title>01Ilkeston and Kirk Hallam</title>
		<content> Most of this area lies to the south of
 Ilkeston town centre.  It is a mixture
 of farmland and fairly densely        
 populated areas.  Kirk Hallam consists
 chiefly of two housing estates, one   
 council and one private and this      
 district has its own community school 
 where many varied activities take     
 place.  The areas around Hallam Fields
 and Little Hallam show a greater      
 variety of housing, old and new, with 
 fewer and much smaller estates.  The  
 natural centre of Ilkeston is the     
 Market Place where the parish church  
 of St. Mary's, the public library, the
 Town Hall and the Police Station are  
 all to be found in close proximity.   
 It is here and in the adjoining       
 streets that the annual October fair  
 is held, and this is one of the major 
 attractions of the town.  Textiles is 
 an important industry.                </content>
