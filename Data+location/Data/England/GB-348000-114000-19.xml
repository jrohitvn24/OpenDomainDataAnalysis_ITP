		<content> This is a weekly lottery named after  
 the nickname given to the computer    
 selecting the Premium Bond numbers.   
 It was started before the current     
 village hall was built to raise funds 
 towards building costs. It has        
 continued ever since (approx 10-12    
 years),and now the money is used  to  
 help finance the hall's improvements  
 and maintenance. The draw is open to  
 anyone for five a pence ticket.For    
 each five pence a week,members are    
 given a number with the chance of     
{winning Â£5 or two Â£1 prizes.}The draw 
 takes place each Thursday afternoon   
 during the over sixties club,and      
 notices are placed around the village 
 to announce the winners.
