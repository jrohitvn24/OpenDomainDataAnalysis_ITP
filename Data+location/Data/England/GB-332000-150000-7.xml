      East Brent C.E.V.C. First School 
 was built in 1841 as a National School
 and enlarged in 1857. It is built of  
 brick with a slate roof and is now a  
 listed building. At one time, 100     
 pupils were taught in this building.  
      Nowadays the school has 57 pupils
 and 2 teachers. The children are 4 - 9
 years and later transfer to Hugh      
 Sexey's Middle School at Blackford.   
 They are taught in one mobile unit and
 one wooden building. There is a large 
 playground.                           
      The school is built between the  
 church and Brent Knoll. Footpaths to  
 Brent Knoll run through the           
 playground. There is a large pond by  
 the hall which is used as             
 a conservation area.
