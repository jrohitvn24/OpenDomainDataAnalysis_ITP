		<title>18PARISH COUNCIL MATTERS</title>
		<content> One of the main concerns of the local 
 parish council has been the{noise}from
 low flying planes from the nearby     
 airfield.  The Council have at        
 times found it necessary to           
 complain about the disturbance        
 from planes and as a result they      
 are usually notified when extended low
 flying is about to take place.        
                                       
 Another regular cause for complaint,  
 particularly in hot weather, is the   
{smell}from{slurry}spread on the fields
 by the farmers.  The smell of it is   
 obnoxious and it causes washing to    
 smell. Rain sometimes washes the      
 slurry into streams where it can be a 
 hazard to livestock. If there is a    
 wedding in the village the farmers are
 asked to refrain from spreading the   
 slurry on the fields for two days!
