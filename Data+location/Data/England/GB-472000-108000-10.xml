		<title>10Stansted Estate</title>
		<content>  The Stansted Estate is a large area  
 of woodlands mainly of Sweet Chesnut, 
 Beech,Oak and Conifers which are      
 grown as timber for the sawmill.      
  Running through the forest is a Beech
 avenue.{The avenue is two miles}long  
 which is the longest in England and it
 leads from Stansted House to Rowlands 
 Castle.                               
  Near the estate House is  St Pauls   
 Chapel.The Chapel is rather unusual in
 that although it is a{Christian Church
 it has a lot of{judaic symbols}in the 
 glass windows. This is because Mr     
 Lewis Way wanted to convert Jews into 
 Christians.                           
  There is a small triangle of woods to
 the south of the estate,the custom is 
 that local people can take bean poles 
 and pea sticks from there.            
  There are a number of farms which    
 have been sold off by the estate.{    </content>
