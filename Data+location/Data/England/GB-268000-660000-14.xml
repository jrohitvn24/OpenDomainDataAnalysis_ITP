		<title>14Survey on Viewpark Glen</title>
		<content>                                       
         Our class carried out a survey
as part of a project we did on our     
local 'Glen' which is near to our sch- 
ool. We made several visits after sch- 
ool to ask 350 local people about their
views on the 'Glen'. Many adults said  
that they would go back down the Glen  
if the rubbish and pollution was       
cleared up. Some were afraid of the    
vandals and people who go there to     
drink or carry on.                     
    Most felt that the money being     
spent on it was worthwhile. They       
hoped that things like good paths and  
picnic tables and things for child-    
ren could be made. Some of these       
will be done soon.                     
    Our class helped to plant          
new trees and we won a competit-       
ion with our project.
