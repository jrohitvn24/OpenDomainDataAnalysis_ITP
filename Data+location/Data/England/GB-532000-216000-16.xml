A typical Monday for me is I wake up   
at 8.00am and get up ten minutes       
later. For breakfast I have cereal and 
a glass of milk then my friend comes   
round for me at 8.30 to go to school.  
From 9.00 to 9.25 we have a form       
period then we go to History until     
10.35. After break we have French,     
dinner is at 12noon. In the afternoon  
is Science and then Art. I get home at 
4.00pm and sit down with a cup of      
coffee and watch television for half   
an hour. I am very keen on ballet and  
have classes on Monday night. First of 
all I do modern until 6.00,then ballet 
until 7.00 followed by a higher class  
of ballet until 8.30.By then I am      
really worn out and can't wait till I  
get home when I have my dinner. I then 
have to do my homework. Finally I have 
a wash and go to bed about 10.00pm.    </content>
