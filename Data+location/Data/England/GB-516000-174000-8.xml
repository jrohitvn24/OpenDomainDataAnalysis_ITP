		<title>08TRAVELLING IN RICHMOND</title>
		<content> Richmond is a busy town which has many
 bus services, an underground station  
 or tube station and a British Rail    
 station. Business people commute into 
 the city on both tube and trains and  
 it takes about 20 minutes when the    
 trains are running frequently. Later  
 at night or at weekends trains and    
 tubes are particularly useful because 
 they run on their own rails and do not
 get caught up in the rush hour traffic
 jams, although early in the morning   
 and between 4 and 6pm they are very   
 crowded-you feel like a sardine packed
 in a tin. Most families in our area   
 have cars and this makes parking      
 difficult on Saturdays. Sometimes it  
 is easier to take one of the many bus 
 services which run into the town      
 centre. Of course walking is also     
 popular but few people walk far today 
 because they are too lazy.            </content>
