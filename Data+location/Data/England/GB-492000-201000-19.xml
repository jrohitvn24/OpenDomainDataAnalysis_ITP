		<content>  Farming in this area is mainly       
arable,that is crops and animals such  
as pigs,sheep and cows.Nearly all farms
use tractors and combine harvesters.A  
lot of the farms in our area only very 
small.(e.g.10 cows and a few sheep and 
will probably have a harvest of hay    
every year.)There are a few farms that 
are quite profitable.There are many    
farms in our block,many next to each   
other.                                 
  At Pednor Vale Farm at the bottom of 
Westdean Lane,the farmer,Bill Dell has 
about 20 cows and a 35 year old Fordson
tractor.Every year he has a small      
harvest of hay.He rents out his yard to
2 people who between them own 4        
traction engines.His farm is very small
with no machinery except his tractor.
