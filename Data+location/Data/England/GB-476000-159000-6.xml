		<title>06Employment in Eversley</title>
		<content>    There is very little employment in 
 Eversley but an old petrol station has
 recently been bought and adapted by an
 electronic company.They make light    
 beam recorders used in the dairy,     
 horticultural,motor and aviation      
 industries.We spoke to Mr.Appleby, the
 managing director of{Micromovements   
{Ltd,}and he told us that they employ  
 twenty local people but are planning  
 to expand soon.Their equipment is sent
 all over the world, including America.
 He told us that some of the employees 
 are university graduates with         
 engineering degrees.The other staff   
 need to be dextrous with good hand /  
 eye control, as their work involves   
 fitting tiny components together often
 using microscopes.The light beam      
 recorders go to large companies such  
 as Honeywell and are mostly used for  
 research purposes.                    </content>
