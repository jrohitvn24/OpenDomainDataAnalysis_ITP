		<title>11MILK DELIVERIES</title>
		<content> milk he delivers trebles.The round is 
 on alternate days in winter.He doesn't
 like cartoned milk because if all the 
 milk was in cartons there would be a  
 montain of cartons you couldn't burn. 
 Unigate delivers his milk and St Ivel 
 his cream.Cream double or clotted is  
 60p a 1/4.In the last 10 years people 
 have become more conscious of fats so 
 they have changed to skimmed milk.To  
 deliver the milk they have to get up  
 at 4 a.m. in the summer and 5.30 a.m. 
 in the winter.The biggest cost of all 
 is labour although fuel costs are     
 high.He owns 2 petrol engined vans and
 1 diesel.The diesel is cheaper to     
 run,easier to maintain and more       
 reliable.There are no starting        
 problems either although fuel is      
 harder to get for the diesel.
