 The{Village Hall}was built by the     
 League of Friends in the 1950s but it 
 now belongs to the Parish Council.  It
 is on the{Harwich Road,}down a short  
 drive.  A sub_committee, made up of   
 all the{village clubs}who use the hall
 regularly, hires out the hall.  People
 from outside the village pay more than
 village clubs.  Oakstones,W.I.,Youth  
 Club and playgroup are all held in the
 village hall.
