		<title>03River Wylye Pests</title>
		<content> There are many kinds of pest on the   
 river wylye.One of them is the swan   
 because it eats the new shoots of weed
 just after winter which is drastic    
 for the fish because they use it for  
 shelter from the sun.                 
   Pike are another pest.They are      
 known to eat eight times ther own     
 weight.The biggest pike caught in the 
 river weighed twenty five pounds.The  
 river hadn't been cleared of pike for 
 eight years.When it was done this year
 eighty six pike were removed and three
 hundred eels.It was done with two     
 electric wires which stun the fish for
 a short time.                         
   Mink are another nuisance.The mink  
 is a deadly killer.They not only eat  
 the fish but they attack the birds on 
 the river banks.They probably escape  
 from mink farms .                     
   The only human nuisance is poachers.</content>
