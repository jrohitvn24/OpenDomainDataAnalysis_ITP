		<content>   Within the four acres of Hangmans   
 Wood seventy two deneholes have been  
 counted. They are mostly together. The
 shafts are a little over a metre in   
 diameter, and end in caves branching  
 into chambers about seven metres long.
 The shafts are now gradually closing  
 in with the soil all around and the   
 debris from above. Many pits show a   
 heap of sand at the base. Each pit is 
 separate from its neighbour.          
   Many suggestions have been made as  
 to the purpose of deneholes. Were they
 goldmines? Of gold there was none, but
 flints were found in plenty, a fact   
 supporting the theory that they were  
 flint mines. Niches stained brown in  
 the walls indicate a form of lighting 
 was used.Evidence suggests they may   
 have been used for grain storage, but 
 their real purpose is yet to be seen.
