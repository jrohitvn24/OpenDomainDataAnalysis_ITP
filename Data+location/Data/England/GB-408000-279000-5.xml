		<content>   On our visit to Billesley Police    
 Station we found out about the crime  
 in our area. The crime rate was not   
 very high. The police in our area use 
 Panda and Zulu cars. Until September  
 1984 they had three horses but now    
 they have none. The police station is 
 an old house converted into a station.
 One of the worst crimes is drug taking
 and it is on the increase. Something  
 else that is on the increase is glue  
 sniffing, although it is not illegal  
 there are lots of children under the  
 agew of sixteen who glue sniff and    
 this is very difficult to stop. The   
 police have a very difficult job      
 especially as they get 10 false calls 
 on average each day which wastes a lot
 of time. They also get about 100 real 
 calls a day. Billesley Police Station 
 do a very good job and catch around   
 33% of the criminals.                 </content>
