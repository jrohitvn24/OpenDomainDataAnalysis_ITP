		<title>14Flora of the Railway Line.</title>
		<content>The railway line from Saxmundham to    
Aldeburgh has long-since stopped having
travelling passengers.  Today the      
C.E.G.B. use the existing line from the
Sizewell Road crossing for transporting
very heavy loads to and from the power 
station at Sizewell.  The track beyond 
has been removed and is now over-grown 
with weeds and flowers.  However, in a 
recent study, sixty different flowers  
and grasses were found to be growing in
this area. Beside the path can be found
gorse, nettles, hawthorn, elder,       
bushes, bramble and bracken.  Many of  
the flowers like stone crop, storks    
bill, bird foot, trefoil, vetch and    
lady's bedstraw grow on the bare       
track, while toadflax, greates         
knapweed, field scabious, carline      
thistle, musk thistle, ragwort,        
ribwort plaintain, honey suckle and    
many grasses grow on the bankside.     </content>
