As well as common garden birds such as blackbirds, chaffinches and blue tits, Satterthwaite is home to a large number of jackdaws. However, a wide variety of birds of the more unusual type are also present, from the pied flycatcher, to redstarts, warblers, nuthatches, green and spotted woodpeckers, tree creepers and hawfinches. The most common birds of prey are buzzards and sparrowhawks.&lt;br />&lt;br />A programme for reintroducing red kites recently commenced, with an initial release of 30 birds. The majority of released chicks survived their first winter, and were found as far away as Dumfries and Galloway and southern counties of England. The programme aims to release more youngsters in the future.&lt;br />&lt;br />Butterflies are in decline across England, but a reasonable population can still be seen in Grizedale, including Holly Blue, Meadow Brown, Painted Lady, Tortoiseshell, Peacock, Red Admiral, and Small Orange.&lt;br />&lt;br />Lizards, slow worms, smooth snakes and adders make up the reptile population.   &lt;br /&gt;
