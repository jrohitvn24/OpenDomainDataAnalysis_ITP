		<title>10The Old Lewes Race Course</title>
		<content>  The stables are built out of brick   
 which is very unusual because they are
 normally made out wood.Although Mrs   
 Ffitch Heyes has been there for two   
 years there is still a lot of building
 development going on and to be done.  
 They have plans to build a riding     
 school for professionel riders.Mr     
 Ffitch Heyes has built himself a large
 bungalow near the stables. Mrs Ffitch 
 Heyes said that one of the main       
 reasons they moved there was because  
 of the good training facilities.      
  The old grandstand is still there,but
 they have taken away all the benches  
 and it could fall down very soon.They 
 also have two starting gates for two  
 horses in an overgrown ditch.Apart    
 from the bungalow and stables the Old 
 Lewes Race Course looks very          
 delapidated and desolate.
