		<title>20 PATTERDALE MOUNTAIN RESCUE</title>
		<content> THERE IS A MOUNTAIN RESCUE CENTRE IN  
 OUR AREA.  THIS IS AN ORGANISATION RUN
 BY LOCAL PEOPLE WHICH CAN BE CALLED   
 UPON IN THE EVENT OF A EMMERGENCY ON  
 THE FELLS.  THE ORGANISATION HAS TO   
 FINANCE ITSELF BY VARIOUS FUND RAISING
 EFFORTS TO PURCHASE NEW EQUIPMENT.    
 CURRENTLY THE CHILDREN AT THIS SCHOOL 
 HAVE RECENTLY WRITTEN A BOOKLET       
 ENTITLED 'OUR DALE' WHICH IS ON SALE  
 TO TOURISTS AND LOCALS, WITH THE      
 PROCEEDS BEING DONATED TO THIS        
 ORGANISATION.  THE TEAM HAS ITS OWN   
 ELECTED LEADER AND THERE ARE ABOUT 20 
 MEMBERS WHO CAN BE CALLED UPON IF A   
 RESCUE IS TO BE CARRIED OUT.  THE TEAM
 HAS TWO LAND ROVER-AMBULANCES.  THE   
 MOST TREACHEROUS MOUNTAIN IN THE LAKE 
 DISTRICT SEEMS TO BE HELVELLYN.  THE  
 TEAM HAS TO ATTEND ABOUT FIFTY RESCUES
 AND SEARCHES A YEAR.
