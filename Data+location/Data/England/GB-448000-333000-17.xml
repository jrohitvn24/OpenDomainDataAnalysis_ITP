		<title>17CHILWELL. Development.</title>
		<content>  We know that the village of Chilwell 
 had grown quite considerably by the   
 1700's - the village was mostly       
 invoved with farming. This continued  
 to be the case until the late 19th    
 century,when the village expanded     
 rapidly but it was still separate from
 Beeston and Nottingham.               
  In this century Chilwell expanded to 
 provide for the housing needs for the 
 people of Nottingham. Building started
 in the 1920's and continued until the 
 late 1970's. Now Chilwell is a        
 dormitory area with most people       
 working in Beeston, Long Eaton or     
 Nottingham.
