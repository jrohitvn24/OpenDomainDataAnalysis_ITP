		<title>13A DAY IN THE LIFE OF REBECCA</title>
		<content> I get up between 7 and 7,30. I Wash   
 and get dressed then I take the dog   
 out. Usually I take him around the    
 fields, where I let him off the lead  
 for a run. When I return I have       
 breakfast then I get in the car to    
 come to school. When mum is working I 
 come to school in the car but when she
 isn't I come in the coach. We live in 
 Chedzoy and mum is a supply teacher at
 Haygrove Comprehensive School.        
 On Thursday we do not have an assembly
 but we have swimming and art. At lunch
 I play with my friends. For my dinner 
 I have sandwiches.                    
 When I get home from school I feed my 
 rabbits, cats, gerbils, guinea pigs   
 and tadpoles then after taking the dog
 out I go to gym. We do bars, beams,   
 floor and vaults. I get home starving.
 After supper I practice the violin    
 and piano, feed the dog then go to bed</content>
