      THE PRESENT CHURCH IS DEDICATED  
 TO ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST and replaces  
 the earlier church which was          
 demolished in 1877.  It was designed  
 by W.J.Hopkins and built at a cost of 
 Â£5,000 in 1878.  It is constructed of 
 Cradley stone with a Bath stone       
 dressing,in the Decorated style of the
 14th century.  It has a western tower,
 housing six bells. These were cast by 
 Abraham and Abel Rudhall of           
 Gloucester.  Of the former church the 
 pointed tomb recess and the Norman    
 font were incorporated into the new   
 building. The clock and chimes are a  
 memorial to the parishioners who died 
 in the First World War.  An unusual   
 feature is the tomb of William Henry  
 Beard which enshrines his Crimean War 
 medals from Sebastapol and Balaclava. </content>
