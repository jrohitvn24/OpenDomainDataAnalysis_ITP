		<content>  When asked if more amenities would   
 spoil or enhance the area,it was      
 interesting to note, that the people  
 who replied that it would spoil the   
 area, were the older members of the   
 community. Most of the people who     
 replied that new amenities would      
 improve the area,did add the rejoinder
 that it depended upon what the new    
 amenities were, as to whether it would
 be an improvement or not.             
    These findings were of such great  
 interest we have offered them to the  
 Parish Council for their perusal.
