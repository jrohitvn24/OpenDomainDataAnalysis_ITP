 In June a children's band came from   
 Norway. They were aged between 10 and 
 18 years. In the group there were 57  
 musicians. Six of the girls were      
 majorettes,they had white fluffy hats 
 and they looked very smart,so did the 
 boys . Our school went to the edge of 
 the playing field where a crowd had   
 gathered. They gave us a concert. One 
 of the tunes that they played was     
 "Swing,Rock and Roll", which won the  
 Eurovision Song Contest this year. The
 leader of the group, who spoke good   
 English, introduced the music. He     
 explained that this was the last tour 
 for the conductor of the band who had 
 been with them for 10 years.
