		<content> The area is divided by the A423 road  
 into two parts which are within       
 separate ecclesiastical and civil     
 parishes. The larger western part is  
 mainly open country. It is described  
 throughout as Steeple Barton although 
 as well as containing the hamlet of   
 Steeple Barton it also includes the   
 outskirts of the village of Middle    
 Barton. The population of 70 approx.  
 looks for facilities to Middle Barton.
 The eastern part, population 1000     
 approx., contains the hamlet of Middle
 Aston and the village of Steeple Aston
 which has many facilities.
