There are no schools within this area, 
so school age children are transported 
by bus or taxi to Eyke First School    
(ages 5 to 9 years), Butley Middle     
School (ages 9 to 13 years), or        
Farlingaye High School in Woodbridge   
(ages 13 to 18 years).                 
                                       
Preschool children ages 3 to 5 can     
attend a playgroup which is held in the
Old School House at Eyke; parents are  
responsible for transport.             
                                       
American children can make use of the  
educational facilities at the          
discretion of the local authorities,   
but parents must arrange their own     
transport.
