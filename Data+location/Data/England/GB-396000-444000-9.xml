		<title>09A WEEKEND IN MAY</title>
		<content>   {The Annual Adventure Weekend}is the
 main event in our village.It is       
 organised by the Social Club.Helwith  
 Bridge,near to Horton-in-Ribblesdale, 
 is a hamlet with a few houses,a quarry
 and an unused school in which we stay.
    On the Adventure Weekend we go     
 swimming,pot-holing,climbing and      
 walking.                              
    The first night was enjoyable      
 because we went pot-holing,wearing our
 old clothes.                          
    When we reached the end of a bumpy 
 track we fitted helmets with lights   
 onto our heads.We clambered over a    
 wall and ran down a field,but we had  
 difficulty in finding the entrance to 
 the cave.We descended a 50ft ladder.  
 The walk through the caves was        
 immensely enjoyable.We walked to the  
 top of Pen-y-Ghent.It seemed longer   
 coming down than ascending.           </content>
