		<title>02Radio Station,      Kesgrave</title>
		<content>   We  interviewed  two of the American
service  staff  from  the   transmitter
station.   The  station is  where it is
because  there were already four towers
there from  the war;  it saved money to
use them instead of building more. Each
tower has two dishes.  It has been used
as a transmitter station since 1963.   
   The station is manned 24 hours a day
by  the  72  people  who  work   there,
working  8-hour  shifts.               
   The  station's  main  use is to send
radio signals all over England and even
further.  The  workers  wear  different
uniforms depending on their job.   Some
repair the  equipment  so  always  wear
overalls,   others  check   things   so
sometimes  wear  a  proper  uniform and
sometimes  overalls.                   
   The  staff  can  be  sent  to  other
places such as Hong Kong  or the United
States  of  America.                   </content>
