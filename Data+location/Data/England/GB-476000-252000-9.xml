		<content> This a dairy and arable farm which    
 supports a herd of 350 Pedigree       
 British Friesians and a small herd of 
 pigs. The farm is divided by the M1   
 motorway and is bounded by the        
 parishes of Quinton and Roade and the 
 route of the former SMJ Railway.      
 The herd of older cattle consists of  
 130 milking cows plus 3 bulls and 70  
 heifers in calf. All calves are reared
 with the females being used as milking
 herd replacements and the males being 
 fattened for slaughter at about       
 eighteen months.  There are currently 
 53 heifers not yet in calf but over   
 one year old, plus 41 female and 27   
 males over six months old, and 14     
 males and 7 females under six months. 
 The 465 acres of land is used for     
 grazing and for growing cereals for   
 feeding the livestock.
