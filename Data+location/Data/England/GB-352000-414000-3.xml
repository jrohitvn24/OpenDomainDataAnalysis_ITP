		<content>Dominated by small owner-occupied dairy
farms of about 50-100 acres,With a     
concentration of one animal per acre.  
Predominantly,herds are either         
Ayreshire,Fresian,or both.Calves are   
cross-bred with Charolais breeding     
bulls for beef and are sold within     
weeks of birth.Milk yield is           
approximately 3.5 gallons per head per 
day and the herds are milked twice     
every day,being fed on meadow grazing  
and cereals.The current market price of
a milking cow is about 500 pounds.Three
months before calving,the cows are     
segregated from the herd to build up   
strength,and thus are not milked during
this period.New calves receive there   
mother's milk for up to two weeks,in   
order to create antibodies against     
infection.
