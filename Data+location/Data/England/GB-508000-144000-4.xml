 Peaslake Church of England School.    
                                       
 At first lessons were held in the Old 
 School Room in the centre of the      
 village.  Records date from l876.     
 A new school was built in l9l3 on     
 Colman's Hill.  Children attended from
 age 5 to l4.  Another classroom was   
 added in l929.  After the l944        
 Education Act children after age ll   
 went to secondary schools outside the 
 village.  Another reorganisation in   
 l973 changed the school to a First    
 School for children aged 5 to 8.  The 
 building is much the same but has been
 well adapted and given modern         
 electrical wiring and internal plumb- 
 ing.  The site is beautiful.  The     
 school is surrounded by gardens, trees
 and playing fields.  There are about  
 fifty children and three teachers.    </content>
