		<title>17Steelworks Reclamation Site</title>
		<content>{British Steel}closed its{Consett works
 in 1980 leaving economic chaos and an 
 industrial eyesore of a 140 hectares. 
 The reclamation work is now well into 
 the third of four phases.Completion of
 this project,currently{the biggest    
{undertaken in Europe,}is scheduled for
 an approximate overall cost of Â£3-Â£4m.
   .Completion implies the setting of  
 the land form with drainage and strong
 fencing. Prospective uses of the site 
 include{industry}in the form of small 
 factories,{agriculture,}both arable   
 and pastural.{Recreational}activities 
 such as football and skiing. Tree     
 plantations will lend the area a      
 pleasant aspect. Possibly the major   
 problem faced by engineer Mr. Sheperd 
 is contamination of the population    
 from poisons like Mercury and Cyanide.
 The project is financed by{Dept. of   
{Environment's}derelect land allocation</content>
