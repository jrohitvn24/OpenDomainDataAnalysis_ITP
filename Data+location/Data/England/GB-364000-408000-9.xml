		<title>09School Games in Lostock 1</title>
		<content>   At{Lostock County Primary School}a  
 very popular game is one called{Foxey.
 There are always two people 'on'.     
 (Perhaps you may have another 12      
 people who are not on). The two people
 who are on have to 'catch' all the    
 other people.                         
                                       
   The first person who is touched has 
 to go and find someone else and when  
 that person is touched he or she joins
 on with the person who touches them.  
 Then they help the first two people to
 get the others.                       
                                       
   It goes on like this until the last 
 person is touched. Then the first two 
 who were touched are on.              
                                       
   We play this game until the end of  
 playtime.
