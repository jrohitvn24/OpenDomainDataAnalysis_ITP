		<title>19James Herriot-The Vet.</title>
		<content> Dog walking, reading, music and       
 football are the main interests of one
 of Britain's best known and loved     
 writers. His Yorkshire tales of a     
 vet's life are told with an insight   
 into the heart of human relationships,
 which has given his work a world      
 wide appeal. Tourists of all          
 nationalities visit his surgery in    
 Thirsk. His fame in both science and  
 literature is reflected by honorary   
 degrees in Veterinery Science from    
 Liverpool University,and in Literature
 from Heriot Watt University,Edinburgh;
 his fellowship of the R.C.V.S.,and by 
 the award of the O.B.E.. Sunderland   
 born,Glasgow raised,James Herriot has 
 been an adopted Yorkshireman for most 
 of his life, and despite his fame he  
 still works as a vet.,together with   
 his son, in the county he as grown to 
 love.                                 </content>
