		<content> The only house  there, is  a  bungalow
 with a big garden. The lady that lives
 there  lets  people   bring  they  own
 caravans  and  stay  in  her   garden.
 Mostly  holiday   makers  stay  there.
 The  first  time we went to  the coast
 road it was at low  tide. The beach is
 quite long  and  covered  in  pebbles,
 exposed to wind which seems as if it's
 never  going to end. We could walk out
 quite along way, except that there are
 some  dangerous  patches, of quicksand
 and because it is so flat the tide can
 come  in  so  fast  that  you  can  be
 trapped and drowned. When  the tide is
 in it can be quite rough  when  it  is
 very  windy  it  makes  the  waves  go
 higher.   There    are   some   public
 toilets and a  shelter with some seats
 in and a view to sea where we did some
 writing.
