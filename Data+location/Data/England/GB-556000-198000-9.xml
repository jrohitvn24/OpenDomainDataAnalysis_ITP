		<title>09HOUSEWIFE'S DAY</title>
		<content> At 4:30am David has woken himself and 
 his sister. They end up in bed with us
 so I get into Gemma's bed. At 6:30 I  
 can hear David downstairs feeding     
 biscuits to the cat so I get up. I    
 make a cup of tea to cheer us up but  
 Mick still goes to work in a bad mood.
 At breakfast David gets Weetabix      
 everywhere, Gemma leaves hers. Later  
 it calms down so I do some sewing,    
 then a friend drops in for me to cut  
 her childrens' hair; more screams!    
 After lunch the children have a sleep 
 and I mow the lawn. At 3:00 I take    
 them to work with me. 2 hours later   
 while they are messing with tea I dash
 round like a mad thing tidying up     
 before Mick gets home. I give them a  
 quick flick with a flannel and bed! I 
 rustle up some food for Mick's tea and
 then I have time to do some sewing    
 before exhaustion and bed at 9:30pm!  </content>
