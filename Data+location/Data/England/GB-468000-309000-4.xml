		<title>04CHANGES IN SOUTH CROXTON</title>
		<content>  One way in which South Croxton has   
 changed is in the the way the farming 
 land is used. A local resident who we 
 interviewed called Mr Jim Elliot,     
 moved from Buckinghamshire to South   
 Croxton after the second world war, in
 search of farmland. at that time he   
 was a partner in a farm, but that only
 lasted for 2 years, and he then began 
 to work a farm on his own. There used 
 to be 10 dairy farms in South Croxton 
 when Mr Elliot first moved there, but 
 now are none. Mr Elliot also commented
 on the decline of the facilities and  
 amenities in South Croxton. There used
 to be a limited bus service to        
 Leicester and Melton Mowbray, but now 
 there is no public transport. All     
 residents are reliant on private cars 
 now.                                  
                                       
                                       </content>
