		<content>   Throughout the Cock Clarks/Purleigh 
 area we found many examples of place  
 names with interesting backgrounds or 
 historical connotations.              
  {Cock Clarks}itself was originally   
 Cock Larks taking this name from the  
 number of birds in the area.          
  {Squeaking-gate Wood}presumably is   
 derived such a gate though we found   
 none.                                 
  {Tatty-bugle Farm}takes its name from
 the Scottish for a scarecrow.         
   Many house names tell historical    
 stories;{Colony House}stands on the   
 site of the old Russian colony,{Quanah
 is named after the first Red Indian   
 Christian who came to England,{       
{Purleigh Herd}is so called because    
 there was once a herd of pigs kept    
 here.
