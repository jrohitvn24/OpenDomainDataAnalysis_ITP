 The general concencus of opinion is   
 that Winestead is a nice small village
 to live in. It is quiet, purely rural 
 and has more trees than most villages 
 in the area because of the            
 plantations. The present owners of the
 School House have logged 42 different 
 species of birds which regularly visit
 their garden.                         
 It was thought that "Town" people     
 should not move into villages such as 
 Winestead as they are generally not   
 prepared to accept the way of life,   
 such as not having main sewerage, no  
 street lights, no footpaths, no shops,
 stubble burning and the smell of      
 fertiliser spread on the fields.      
 No public service bus passes through  
 Winestead, the nearest one being on   
 the 1033 Hull to Withernsea road.     </content>
