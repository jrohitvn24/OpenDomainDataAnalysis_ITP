		<title>10RIVER LOCK AT NABBS ISLAND</title>
		<content> The area of the{River Trent}where the 
 lock is situated is called{The Nabbs.}
 To cope with the 8 foot drop in the   
 river, a top side bull-nosed weir has 
 been constructed to relieve the       
 pressure on the Hazelford bank.  The  
 50 year old lock and cottage on{Nabbs 
{Island}are reached by a narrow metal  
 foot bridge over the river.  The lock 
 is hand operated and is 85 feet long, 
 30 feet wide, and 30 feet deep.  It   
 holds a quarter of a million gallons  
 of water and fills in 3 minutes.  The 
 15 foot gates are made of solid oak   
 with 2 sluices on each gate.  A boat  
 can pass through the lock in 12 - 15  
 minutes.  The lock-keeper is on call  
 24 hours a day and has constant radio 
 contact with all river traffic in the 
 area.
