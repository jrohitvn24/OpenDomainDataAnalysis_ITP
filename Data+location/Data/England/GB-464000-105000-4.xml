  The Drayton Manor Estate was built in
 about the 18th Century. The cottage,  
 which used to be the stables for the  
 coach horses is quite fascinating and 
 some of the things are still original 
 like the cobblestones outside the     
 cottage, the beams in the bedrooms,   
 the coach lamps, the stable and the   
 old wall in the garden which divides  
 East Cosham from Drayton. A family    
 named Secor were the original owners. 
  The Stables have been transformed    
 into living rooms, the harness room   
 into a kitchen and what used to be the
 place for the coaches is now a garage.
