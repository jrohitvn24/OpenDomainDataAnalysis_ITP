		<title>04Houses in Sheerness</title>
		<content>         Most of the houses are small  
 and terraced but along the sea front  
 are larger grand 3 and 4 storied ones 
 of the late{19th century.}Further from
 the town centre are detached and semi-
 detached properties, the larger having
 been converted into{flats.}           
         A feature of the sea-front is 
 the row of tall terraced houses known 
 as "Shrimp Terrace" because of the    
 colour of the stone.                  
         Behind the town centre are    
 streets of terraced properties most of
 which have no front garden and only a 
 small back one. At the backs of these 
 houses there is a network of alleys.  
         The{terraced houses}are in    
 narrow roads lined with parked cars   
 which makes the roads difficult to    
 drive down.                           
      Much of the{housing}is owner     
 occupied but some is privately rented.</content>
