		<title>03Housing in and around Darton</title>
		<content>   Around Darton there are different   
 types of{homes}such as terraced,      
 detached and semi detached houses,    
 bungalows,stone cottages and farm     
 houses.The terraced houses were built 
 for the families of local miners.These
 houses only have small gardens but    
 there are allotments nearby which can 
 be rented.People grow vegetables and  
 flowers on them or some have pigeon   
 lofts.Three of the streets of terraced
 houses in Darton are being improved   
 with new paved areas and plots of     
 trees.                                
   Kexbrough has a large council owned{
{housing estate}.The first houses were 
 built in 1922 for rent,but some have  
 been bought.Privately owned houses    
 have been built in the last 20 years. 
  {Mining subsidence}has caused damage 
 to a lot of houses and they have had  
 to be repaired or demolished.         </content>
