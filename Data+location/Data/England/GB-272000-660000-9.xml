		<title>09SHOPPING IN BELLSHILL</title>
		<content>   Over the years the number of shops  
 in Bellshill has decreased. No longer 
 are there lots of small shops selling 
 a varied selection of goods,but there 
 are larger ones selling mostly the    
 same items.Of the smaller shops which 
 remain the majority of them are owned 
 by parent companies.                  
   Indoor Markets have also appeared.  
 They consist of small privately owned 
 stalls.Much of what they sell is      
 cheap,but of inferior quality. All in 
 all there is a lack of good shops in  
 Bellshill.                            
   As the style of shop changes so do  
 the shopping habits.Now usually the   
 whole family goes on a shopping       
 expedition,rather than just the mother
 of the family.Now instead of buying   
 the food for the day food for the     
 whole week is bought at the one time.
