		<content>    Our area has a fine history of     
 transport crossed as it is by the     
{Chelmer - Blackwater Canal}.Also the  
 former {Railway Line}from Maldon to   
 Witham passes by Langford.Today,one   
 main road passes through our area at  
 Langford.The valley is patterned with 
 roads which serve the little Hamlets  
 like Curling Tye Green,and farms.The  
 road from Ulting to Woodham Walter    
 makes the first upstream crossing of  
 the river Chelmer-It's often          
 flooded.Most of the families in our   
 area own a car (Only 14% in Ulting and
 13% in Langford of Families {don't}own
 cars).School Buses pick up children to
 take them to school in Maldon &amp;       
 Witham.Other services are not good.   
 Nine buses go through Langford but    
 none on Sundays and{no}"Commuter      
 Buses" serve Woodham Walter.
