		<title>19A Day With Stephanie</title>
		<content>I am 8 years old and I go to Bandon    
Hill Primary School in Wallington. I   
get up at 6.45am and have a wash and   
get dressed. Then I get our cats and   
my breakfast. I usually have toast     
butter and marmalade. Afterwards, I    
clean my teeth and pack my bags for    
school. I leave home at 8.10am with my 
mummy and younger brother. We leave    
early because mummy is our school      
lollipop lady. I play chase or skipping
on the playground until the bell goes  
at 8.55am. We wait in our class lines  
for our teachers to take us to our     
classrooms. After the register we go   
to the hall for assembly, where we     
sing  hymns and have a story and       
prayers. We spend the morning doing    
English or maths. We have playtime from
10.35 to 10.50am.6
