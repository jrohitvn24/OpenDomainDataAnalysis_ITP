		<content>   {RURAL ROADS IN OWSTON AREA         
  Everyone in Owston has at least one  
 motor vehicle which is essential for  
 movement in and out of the village,   
 and some have 4_wheel drive cars for  
 extra mobility. Farmers use tractors  
 for movement on the farms. Owston has 
 no public transport.  Situated two    
 miles from a main road, Owston is     
 served by minor roads. In snowy       
 weather a farmer is contracted to     
 clear the snow. Some people have      
 bicycles or motor cycles.
