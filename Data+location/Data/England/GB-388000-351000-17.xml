		<title>17A Child's Sunday near Norton</title>
		<content>On Sunday morning I got up at 8.30 a.m.
I washed, dressed and went to clean my 
rabbits out. When I came back into the 
house I washed my hands and started to 
help Mum to do some baking because it  
was my brother's birthday. He was 8 and
we were having a party. I made a peach 
trifle with brandy, some little cakes  
called pastry chouxs and helped Mum to 
make a chocolate cake, which Paul      
covered in Maltesers. Later we made    
some sandwiches and salad and lots of  
other good things to eat. Later in the 
afternoon Paul's friend Ian came to    
play. We all had a game of cricket on  
the back lawn. My uncle Tony was       
invited for tea but we had to wait a   
while because he was late. We played   
lots of other games but when we started
to lock one another in the shed we got 
shouted at so I went in the living room
and watched the television.            </content>
