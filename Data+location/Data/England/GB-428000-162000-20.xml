		<title>20EMPLOYMENT IN SHALBOURNE</title>
		<content> Although a farming area, few people   
 are now employed on the land. Many    
 agricultural workers have had to find 
 other occupations; some are now self  
 employed using their skills in land-  
 scape gardening, grass/hedge cutting  
 etc. Others work for Local Authorities
 or in public utilities. Many women in 
 the area do domestic work, there being
 more work available than those able or
 willing to do it. There are several   
 small businesses or agencies run from 
 homes. About half the working popula- 
 tion are employed in adjoining towns. 
 There is not a high percentage of     
 unemployment in the area; most over 18
 year olds leave the village for       
 training and find work elsewhere.
