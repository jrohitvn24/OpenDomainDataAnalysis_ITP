 To the western side of our area is the
 village of North Baddesley. This area 
 is mostly farmland growing grass for  
 silage and some spring barley. There  
 are four farms in this area: Manor    
 Farm, Zion's Hill Farm, Knightswood   
 Farm and Ryder's Farm.                
                                       
 There is also an area of woodland     
 mostly of coniferous trees. In this   
 woodland is a small game park.        
                                       
 On the eastern side of the area is    
 Chandler's Ford. This area is mainly  
 formed of residential and industrial  
 estates.                              
                                       
 There is a railway through this area  
 which connects Eastleigh with Romsey.
