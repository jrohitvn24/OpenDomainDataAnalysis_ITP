		<content> The Domesday block which we covered   
 was in{North West London.}It included}
 Brondesbury Park,Cricklewood,Harlesden
 Willesden and Willesden Green.These   
 were just small villages until the    
 coming of the railways.They grew      
 rapidly as people wanted to live in   
 'rural' areas and travel to work in   
 Central London.Traditionally,the area 
 has been a centre for Irish culture.  
 This is still true but more recently  
 the area has become more multiracial  
 in nature.There have also been changes
 in employment but many of the deeper  
 problems of unemployment have largely 
 passed us by.Our account will focus on
 the following areas:                  
{TRANSPORT      }-  Pages  1 to  5     
{EMPLOYMENT     }-  Pages  6 to  7     
{RECREATION     }-  Pages  8 to 12     
{LIFE STYLES    }-  Pages 13 to 19
