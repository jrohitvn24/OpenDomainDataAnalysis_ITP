		<content>    The area being studied is a        
 picturesque{rural area}to the south of
 Bridgnorth in Shropshire. The rolling,
 green fields are broken up by small   
 hamlets and communities.              
                                       
    The{population}is small, and most  
 of their lives revolve around the     
 rural community, but they are aware   
 too of the changes taking place in the
 locality and the country at large.    
                                       
    The{survey}has been undertaken by  
 24 children aged 10-11 years at the   
 Down County Primary School, which is  
 within the 12 square kilometres       
 surveyed. The children were assisted  
 by Mr. M. Vincent, their Headteacher.
