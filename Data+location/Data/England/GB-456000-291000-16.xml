		<title>16STUCTURE PLAN - WILLOUGHBY</title>
		<content> The Leicestershire stucture plan      
 sets out the county council's planning
 policies and it's main proposals for  
 industrial and residential change and 
 development.                          
  Under this plan, in Willoughby       
 Waterleys new housing development is  
 not considered desirable, other than  
 on a very limited scale.              
  Houses will only be built for those  
 who need to live in the village. For  
 example some people may need to live  
 in or near Willoughby Waterleys while 
 others may  have close family         
 association within the village.       
  Willoughby also features in a        
 conservation area which means changes 
 are carefully controlled.In addition  
 old buildings are protected and money 
 may be given to assist this. The plan 
 helps to maintain the characteristics 
 of villages like Willoughby.          </content>
