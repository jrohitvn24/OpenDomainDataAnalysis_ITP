		<title>07Accident Blackspot</title>
		<content> Residents are very concerned about the
 number of accidents which have        
 occurred at the junction of two busy  
 roads in the village and have called  
 in{traffic}experts to 'slow-down'     
 vehicles and study traffic flow.      
     Options are the installation of   
 traffic lights or a roundabout.Costing
 has already started for the latter to 
 see if it is affordable and police are
 looking closely at an idea to put up  
{speed}warning signs.                  
     Matters were brought to a head    
 recently with a horrific{crash}which  
 resulted in the deaths of two young   
 men.                                  
 Local councillors,safety experts and  
 police are due to meet shortly to     
 discuss the problem in depth.
