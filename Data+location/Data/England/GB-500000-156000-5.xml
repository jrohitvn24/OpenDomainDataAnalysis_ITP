		<content>{Papercourt Lock}                      
   The lock gates were replaces in     
 1980. The lock keeper lives in        
 Papercourt cottage. There were 5      
 houseboats each with a plot of land   
 and a shed. The river has private     
 fishing rites owned by a local farmer 
 and the mooring fee has to be paid to 
 the National Trust. People may moor on
 the side of the river which has a     
 towpath. The original course of the   
 river runs parallel to the man made   
 course. To the left of the original   
 river is marshland which is used for  
 rough grazing.                        
{Newark Mill}                          
   The mill which is now a ruin has    
 milled for 300 years finishing in     
 1946. Newark Mill cottage is now a    
 private dwelling. The owner farms 220 
 acres as meadow and keeps Beef cattle.
