		<title>12A day in my life</title>
		<content> The juniors  recommence work at 1 o   
 clock whereas the infants are lucky   
 because they have until 1.30p.m. to   
 play.                                 
  The afternoon begins with P.E. We get
 changed into our kit and then go      
 outside for a game of rounders,cricket
 or athletics.In the winter we play    
 football or netball.When the game has 
 finished we go inside and get changed 
 into our uniform again.Afterwards we  
 read or do some other work until      
 playtime at 2.20p.m.It is just like   
 morning break in as much as we don't  
 get much time and it goes very        
 quickly.During the last part of the   
 day we complete any work that we have 
 not finished until school ends at     
 3.30p.m. At 3.30p.m. we grab our coats
 and bags and run out of school,glad   
 that another day is over.
