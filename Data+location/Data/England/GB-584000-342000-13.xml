		<content> Sir Edward Coke was born in 1551.  He 
 was the founder of the family         
 fortunes.  He had twelve children.    
 Thomas Coke who was born in 1697 built
 Holkham Hall.  Another Thomas William 
 Coke became the Earl of Leicester in  
 1837.  He was also known as Coke of   
 Norfolk because of his work as a      
 farmer.  The estate is at present     
 managed by Viscount Coke, son of the  
 sixth Earl of Leicester.  The kitchen 
 is reached by going down many passages
 and shows the hard work which went    
 into cooking meals in days gone by.   
 The pans had to be polished regularly 
 to keep them clean.
