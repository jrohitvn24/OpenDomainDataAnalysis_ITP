		<title>09FARMING SEASCALE/GOSFORTH</title>
		<content> One Wednesday at 9pm I went out with  
 my dad to calf a cow.We got the       
 calfing bands and a bucket of warm    
 soapy water.The calf was stuck though.
 Dad said "Go and phone the vet,Craig."
 The vet came at about 100 m.p.h. from 
 Beckermet.The first thing he asked was
 could he use the calving aid and would
 I go and get it? When I got back Dad  
 said "Go and get my razor.We will have
 to do a caesarean." Caesarean means   
 one side of the cow is cut open to get
 the calf out.The vet was puffing and  
 panting from pulling the calf.The calf
 came quite quickly.I kept on holding  
 the power.Dad and Darren took the calf
 away to the top of the shed to rub it.
 The vet then got his sewing equipment 
 and sewed up three layers of innards. 
 Dad came from the top of the shed     
 about half an hour later.It was very  
 exciting.                             </content>
