		<title>01LONG MYND</title>
		<content> The{Longmynd}is in south-east         
 Shropshire.It is owned by the         
{National Trust}.It's a very marshy    
 moorland area with bracken and        
 heather.It is very cold with strong   
 winds that wreck young trees.They also
 have a higher rainfall.There is only  
 short grass for{rough grazing}.The    
 farmers leave their sheep up there for
 the spring and summer,then bring them 
 down in the autumn.There is a rough   
 road that runs over the Longmynd and  
{tourists}can walk mainly  where they  
 want.There is a stream that runs right
 through the middle of it and through  
 Church-Stretton.The Longmynd is one of
 Britains most beautiful parts of the  
 country.
