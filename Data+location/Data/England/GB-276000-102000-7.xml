		<title>07COPPLESTONE STATION</title>
		<content>    The railway line from Crediton to  
 Barnstaple was the subject of a long  
 struggle for ownership between 1846   
 and 1852. Eventually the South Western
 Railway and the Taw Vale Companies    
 joined to construct the North Devon   
 Railway, and work on the line was     
 begun at Copplestone on 2nd February, 
 1852. The first Station master was    
 William Leyman.                       
    In the 1960s one of the two lines  
 was taken up, and the signal box was  
 demolished.  The station buildings    
 have been sold as a house, and the    
 station is now unmanned. Trains stop  
 at the station two times a day in     
 each direction but other trains stop  
 by request. There has been some talk  
 of closing the line because it        
 operates at a loss, but so far it     
 remains open.
