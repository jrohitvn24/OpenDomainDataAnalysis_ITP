 there are daily newspaper deliveries  
 to nearly every house, although people
 with drives usually leave a pipe at   
 their gate for delivery men. the local
 newspapers covering the area are the  
 haslemere herald and the midhurst     
 observer-these print news and pictures
 of all local events. a fairly new     
 introduction is the free publication  
 which is delivered whether you want it
 or not. this is full of local         
 advertisements and promotions as well 
 as stories. there is the weekly       
 messenger and the monthly three       
 counties shopper. it is estimated that
 every house and many cars have a radio
 and at least 95% of houses have a     
 television. the 5% without are not the
 poorest, they just do not want it.    
 news still travels remarkably fast    
 through a village by word of mouth.   </content>
