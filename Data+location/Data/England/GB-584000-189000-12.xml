		<title>12The Railway</title>
		<content> The railway has been one of the things
 that greatly affected life in this    
 corner of Essex and changed it from an
 area of quiet, peaceful villages,     
 surrounded by farmlands and woods to  
 the busy commercial area that it is   
 today.(Although the farmland and the  
 woods have not,thankfully, disappeared
 altogether.) The railway was built in 
 1889 and on 3rd October 1889, at 7.13 
 a.m.the first passenger train for     
 Rochford, Hockley and London left     
 Southend Station. Rochfordians set out
 early on their penny farthings headed 
 by the local chemist, Mr. Harrington, 
 who bought the first ticket, No. 0001.
 Since those early days the line has   
 been electrified.At Rochford only the 
 Victorian goods-shed that used to     
 house sheep's wool, grain etc.,remains
 which has been restored and is now a  
 community centre -"The Freight House."</content>
