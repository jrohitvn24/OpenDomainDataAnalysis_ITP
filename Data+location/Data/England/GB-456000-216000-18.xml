		<title>18WEST END FARM (2)</title>
		<content>Technological improvements have brought
about changes in modern farming.A task 
such as ploughing is no longer         
restricted to daylight hours.Powerful  
lights and comfortable cabs enable the 
drivers to work late into the night in 
both autumn and spring preparing the   
fields for their crops.Crops are       
sprayed against disease by light plane 
or helicopter.Mr Baker built a large   
reservoir, with a capacity of 7 million
gallons,just below the farm in 1977.   
This was done to enable the potato crop
to be irrigated at the right time in   
order to swell the tubers and to combat
periods of drought.Mr Baker feels that 
the crop fits in well with the system  
of crop rotation he employs on his     
farm.The potatoes are harvested by     
machine,stored in large sheds and      
bagged during the winter before being  
sold to local distributors.            </content>
