		<content>  There are 3 churches and chapels in  
 the area they are called st.Peters    
 church st.Marys st.Endellion. There   
 are quite a lot of places of worship  
 in the area   because  all the village
 used to go  church .  Not  all  of    
 them are used today as not many people
 go to church regularly. The oldest    
 church is St. Endellion where the     
 vicar Father Hugh Fryer lives. The    
 cemetery is at st. Endellion and there
 are the remains of many sailors       
 drowned around the coast buried here. 
 The methodist minister is Rev. Young  
 He has been a minister for 15 years   
 and preaches in 10 other chapels apart
 from the one in Port Isaac. There used
 to be 2 chapels in the village but one
 of them has recently been pulled down.
 Some old chapels are made into houses 
 and holiday cottages.
