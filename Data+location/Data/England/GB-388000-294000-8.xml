		<content>Penn Common is a green belt of land on 
the edge of an urban area. The common  
is mainly a private golf course and    
isolated farms and houses can be found 
on the outside edge. There are many    
features situated on and around Penn   
Common.  These include:                
1.  Penn Riding School                 
2.  Tetherered animals on the common   
3.  Pub, "The Barley Mow"              
4.  Duck pound                         
5.  Golf Course.

urban area.  These conflicts include:  
People trespassing on private land.    
Animals grazing on the golf course.    
People using the golf course for       
walking their dogs.
