		<content> Prices fifty years ago,in Marks and   
 Spencers - nothing over 1d,now half a 
 pence.You could buy thirteen buns for 
 a shilling,5 pence.Now you can't buy  
 one for 5 pence.Milk was 2d a pint,1  
 pence.Now 23 pence a pint.A haircut   
 was 4d,2 pence,now Â£2.00.Petrol was 7 
 pence a gallon,now Â£2 a gallon.One    
 thing that hasn't changed until       
 recently is the charge for public     
 toilets.For many years this was one   
 pence.Now the charge is five pence.   
 There were no combine harvesters fifty
 years ago.In 1939 most cottages kept  
 two pigs.They killed one at Christmas,
 the other was sold.Only farmers keep  
 pigs now.The aerodrome was built in   
 1941 for the Royal Air Force.Most     
 runways have been dug up.The perimeter
 has been kept for planes to spray     
 crops.
