		<title>03Locals &amp; Newcomers, Bridgham</title>
		<content> Of the many changes that have taken   
 place in village life over the last 20
 years, perhaps the most significant   
 has been the arrival of the newcomer. 
                                       
 From returns made to a survey, we     
 discovered that 22.5% of the          
 population now living in the village  
 were actually born in Bridgham, whilst
 a further 38% were born elsewhere in  
 East Anglia.  The remaining 39.5% of  
 the returns showed birth places in    
 other parts of the country and indeed,
 from other countries.  Whilst it may  
 be argued that, in many places, locals
 and newcomers do not always mix well  
 together, this cannot be said of      
 Bridgham:  for such a small village,  
 there is a great deal of community    
 atmosphere and spirit _ best          
 illustrated by the response to the    
 proposed gravel works.                </content>
