		<content> Because this is a rural area many     
 people visit from {Newcastle.}Some    
 stay in the numerous wooden chalets   
 around this area.Several of these have
 permanent residents who form part of  
 the local community but the majority  
 come only for weekends and holidays.  
 There are several chalets at {Overdene
{Farm}all are well cared for and many  
 have immaculate and well stocked      
 gardens.It must be refreshing for city
 dwellers to be able get a breath of   
 country air-to go for walks in the    
 beautiful countryside,have a pint in  
 the local pub,and know that children  
 can safely play in the fields and     
 nearby park.Other farms have caravan  
 sites,both for static and travelling  
 vans,one,{Spital Farm }regularly hosts
 a meet from the caravan club.Amenities
 are basic,but fresh farm eggs and     
 lovely scenery make up for a lot.     </content>
