		<title>19FOOTPATHS CHANGING</title>
		<content> We visited{Southall Farm}where we saw 
 how the footpaths have altered. One   
 footpath goes through a farmyard, the 
 other goes through a field, in both   
 cases the farmer is not happy. The    
 proposed footpath changes are that the
 paths will cross south of Southall    
 Farm.The one path will cross a stream,
 here youngsters are on a Y.T.S scheme 
 have built a new bridge. The other    
 footpath that used to cross a field   
 will now follow a field boundry and   
 then follow the stream path to        
 Doverdale and in the other direction  
 to Hadley. There is also a bridle way 
 for horses, Hadley to Doverdale.      
{MR Bayliss}a parish council, lived at 
 Comhampton. When he was a boy he used 
 to walk from his home through         
{Sytchampton}to Doverdale church. There
 was only one field between Sytchampton
 and Doverdale called Cow Pastures.    </content>
