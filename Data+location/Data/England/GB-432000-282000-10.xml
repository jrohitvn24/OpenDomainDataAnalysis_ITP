		<title>10SHOPPING IN HOLBROOKS</title>
		<content>{Debbie Bee age11/Paul Partridge age10 
 On Wednesday June 12th a group of ten 
 children went to do a{shopping survey 
 in{Holbrook Lane. }They interviewed   
 28 people who used those shops.We     
 asked 8 questions.One man came from   
 Birmingham which was the furthest away
 he worked at the Dunlop.One of the    
 questions we asked was:_Is there any  
 other kind of{shop}that you would like
 here that isn't here at the moment?but
 most people were satisfied.

 A lot of waste land in the Longford   
 area has had huge shops built on it   
{Smiths Do It All}sells the lot.The    
 big garden centre sells seeds and     
 plants.At{MFI}you can buy furniture.  
{Complete Auto}is a{Do It Yourself shop
 for motorists.In Judds Lane there are 
 gypsies.They have a massive dog which 
 luckily is on a chain.                </content>
