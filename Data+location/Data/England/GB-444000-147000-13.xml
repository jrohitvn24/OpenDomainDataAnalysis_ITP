		<title>13Games children play.</title>
		<content>    We then thought about some of the  
 games people play.Here we have written
 about some of the games children play.
   1.Sticky Glue.                      
 You first of all have to choose       
 someone to be 'It',that person spreads
 out their fingers and everyon else in 
 the game holds one of the fingers.'It'
 then shouts Sticky Glue and everyone  
 has to run off and'It' chases after   
 them.If we are caught we have to stand
 still with our arms out until someone 
 runs under them to set us free.Some   
 people also call this game Stuck in   
 the Mud.                              
   We also enjoy playing Bulldog where 
 two people have to try and stop people
 running from one line to another,the  
 first two people caught are then it.  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
