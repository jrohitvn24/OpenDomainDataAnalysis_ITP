 housing estate approximately 2.5km    
 from Ashby town centre.It has been    
 built on Norris Hill                  
   There are about 200 houses onthe    
 estate.A small group of shops serves  
 the community.A primary school is     
 situated on the north of the          
 development.                          
   The houses are mainly detached two  
 story dwellings or bungalows.They are 
 all privately owned.The average price 
 for a house in 1985 is Â£34 000_this   
 would be for a three bedroomed        
 property.                             
   There is no industry on the estate  
 so people have to travel to nearby    
 towns such as Ashby,Coalville,Burton  
 on Trent and Derby.                   
   Secondary school children go to     
 Ivanhoe High and Ashby Grammar school.
