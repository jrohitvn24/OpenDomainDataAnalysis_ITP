		<content>       This engineering firm makes     
 railway braking systems.              
 In a typical day we're all very busy  
 the first thing we do is look at the  
 mail to see what immediate action     
 needs to be taken.If I  became        
 unemployed I wouldn't know what to do 
 because I've always worked with       
 trains.                               
       When I was young I wanted to    
 join the Navy but I was too young so I
 became an accountant. Ilike the job   
 it's very satisfying. Istarted at the 
 bottom and worked my way to the top.  
       There is nothing that happens   
 every day at exactly the same time    
 every day is different.               
       We officially work a thirty nine
 hour week,but unofficially we often   
 work sixty hours                      
                                       
                                       </content>
