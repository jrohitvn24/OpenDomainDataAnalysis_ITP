 The area covered is divided into      
 the civil parishes of King's Somborne,
 Bossington, Michelmersh and           
 Mottisfont.  It is part of the Test   
 Valley and is predominantly rural.    
 The River Test flows through the      
 middle of the block from North to     
 South, to the west high chalk hills   
 come down to water meadows with       
 rolling farmland beyond the river to  
 the east. The country is partly       
 wooded to the west.  The main road    
 from Romsey to Stockbridge, an        
 important through route, winds its way
 roughly parallel with the river. Large
 agricultural estates farm much of the 
 area, and the river fishing is well_  
 managed and expensive. The two        
 villages Mottisfont and Michelmersh   
 are small, old and quietly rural.
