		<content>   (Ruth, age 12):  My school is       
 Eastbury Comprehensive. School starts 
 at 9.15 a.m. and ends at 3.40 p.m. I  
 like Tuesday best because we have a   
 very easy day. We have French and     
 English for 30 minutes each, then Art 
 for an hour and Woodwork and Geography
 for an hour each.                     
   I like Woodwork best because I like 
 to build things with my hands. I don't
 like Art much because I'm not very    
 good at it.                           
   Other subjects we do in the week    
 are:- Science, Mathematics,           
 Needlework, P.E., Metalwork, History  
 and Design. We also have a Year Period
 each week on Monday afternoon.  Our   
 Year Head talks to us then, or he     
 might show us a film or bring a guest 
 speaker.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
