		<title>04Peace Camps and Protests</title>
		<content> Next to the Upper Heyford Air Base has
 been set up a camp of squatters who   
 are protesting at having American     
 Nuclear forces stationed there. They  
 are not local people but live in a    
 collection of caravans, tents and     
 huts. They are mainly unemployed. The 
 local council has tried to move them  
 but without success. Local publicans  
 refuse to serve them.                 
                                       
 From time to time the Campaign for    
 Nuclear Disarmament has protest       
 marches to the base.Sometimes they    
 block the road or try to get into the 
 base and cut the perimeter fence. The 
 Police often arrest large numbers of  
 protesters and some disruption of     
 their daily lives is caused to local  
 people.
