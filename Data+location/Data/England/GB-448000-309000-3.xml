		<content> On Saturday I woke up about 6.30 a.m. 
 and read for an hour. I then got up   
 and washed, dressed and cleaned my    
 teeth. I went downstairs and switched 
 on the T.V. My mum came down and made 
 some breakfast. I went to the         
 newsagent's for a 'Blue Jeans' which I
 buy each week. I called for Jayne, one
 of my best friends, but she wasn't    
 in.I went home and rang my friend     
 Helen and we watched a video called   
 'Police Academy'at her house.I went   
 home for lunch and about 1 p.m. Helen 
 came round and we got dressed to go to
 the fete at Mercenfeld School. We were
 in the fancy dress parade which       
 started at 1.30 p.m.When I got home I 
 had a bath and washed my hair after   
 tea. I put on the T.V.at 8.10 p.m. and
 watched Dynasty. Then I went to bed   
 and read and eventually went to sleep.
