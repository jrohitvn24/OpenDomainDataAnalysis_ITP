		<title>14WILBERFOSS VILLAGE SHOP</title>
		<content>   The villae shop is run along with   
 the post office.  It has recently been
 made much bigger and carries more     
 stock. On average the shop has 1200   
 customers per day, with Thursday being
 the busiest because of it being       
 pension-issue day.  The item which is 
 sold most is sweets and the most      
 often-sold frozen food is peas. The   
 present owners would like to expand   
 the shop further by adding a butcher's
 department.  The most common complaint
 from customers concerns prices, a fact
 that annoys the postmaster as there is
 little he can do about the problem.   
   The shop owners have 4 people to    
 help, one of whom works full time, the
 others part-time.  The shop has       
 recently been featured in a T.V. pro- 
 gramme to be screened in 1986 on BBC  
 "LOOK NORTH".
