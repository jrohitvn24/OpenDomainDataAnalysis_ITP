		<content> Birdbrook has an attractive Community 
 House which used to be the school.It  
 changed in 1957-8.We also saw the Old 
 Chapel which was quite big.We looked  
 at the door which had lovely          
 patterns on the hinges.Bailey Hill    
 Farm grows mostly Barley and is farmed
 by Mr Unwin who owns 400 acres in the 
 area.There is a village shop and when 
 it was built,it was intended to be a  
 sub-post office but that fell through 
 and so the shop is really too big and 
 has to be kept well stocked to fill up
 the space.The village would have liked
 a post office.There is a village pond 
 with ducks and a pub called The Plough
 which serves lunches and evening      
 meals.Many of the farms in the        
 Birdbrook area are still protected by 
 moats-Moat Farm,Whitleys, Birdbrook   
 Hall.
