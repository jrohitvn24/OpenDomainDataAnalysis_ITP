		<title>14BANKING IN LONGTOWN.</title>
		<content> The Banking requirements of the       
 inhabitants of Longtown District are  
 provided by two Clearing Banks        
 (Midland &amp; Barclays) together with a  
 branch of the Cumberland Building     
 Society.As can be appreciated,a large 
 proportion of business is with the    
 farming community and those connected 
 with it.An estimated 25% of Midland   
 Bank customers are in this category.  
 There is little industry in the area  
 and the remainder of business mainly  
 consists of Haulage,Retail and        
 Construction.Of the Personal          
 Customers,a large proportion are      
 employed at the nearby Ministry of    
 Defence Installations.In recent       
 years,there has been very little new  
 residential development in the town   
 and therefore the population is       
 largely static.Consequently new       
 accounts are difficult to obtain.     </content>
