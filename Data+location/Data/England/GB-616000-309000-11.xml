 Bowthorpe is a large new housing      
 development being built to the south  
 of the A47 road, opposite New         
 Costessey.                            
                                       
 It was a village at the time of the   
 original Domesday survey.  Bowthorpe  
 comes from Boi's Thorp, meaning Boi's 
 Farm or Village.  The village was     
 levelled by the 1500s, only the ruin  
 of the church, St Michaels, being left
 to show that there had been a village 
 there.                                
                                       
 In 1973 Norwich City Council bought a 
 600 acre site for Â£9\ million.  The   
 first 'village' to be developed was   
 Clover Hill, followed by Chapel Break,
 which is nearing completion......
