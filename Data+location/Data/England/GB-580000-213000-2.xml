		<title>02ST.NICHOLAS CHURCH, WITHAM.</title>
		<content> St. Nicholas Church is 600 years old  
 and is made of flint and small        
 stones.The corners are stone. There   
 are Roman bricks in the tower which   
 can be seen miles away.There are eight
 bells that were put in between 1601   
 and 1932.The oldest memorials have    
 been lost but there is a parish chest 
 with three locks.It  looks like a     
 pirates chest. There is a tomb with   
 effigies of a Tudor judge and his wife
 (Judge Southcote).In the churchyard   
 are two gravestones with skulls and   
 crossbones on them.                   
  In Summer they have a Medieval Fayre 
 to raise monay to repair the church.  
 Lots of people dress up and they have 
 dancing,mummers plays, and people     
 playing old instruments. There are    
 lots of stalls in the church yard and 
 on the green. It is a lot of fun.
