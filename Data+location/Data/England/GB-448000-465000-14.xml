{FURNISHINGS-}To decorate rooms people 
 use wallpaper there are lots of       
 different patterns.There is also plain
 wallpaper and another wallpaper called
 chip wood which it is possible to     
 paint over.                           
 Most people have curtains.Some have   
 blinds at the windows.Curtains are    
 sometimes operated by string but      
 mostly by hand.Curtains also have     
 patterns and have the same variety as 
 wallpaper.Blinds are mostly plastic   
 or made from material, operated by    
 two strings when one is pulled it     
 opens or closes.                      
 Today most floors are covered by patt-
 erned carpet.Mostly in kitchens there 
 is lino on the floor.                 </content>
