		<content>  This area has rich pasture and arable
 land which is mainly used for dairy   
 cattle (Friesian Cows), some beef     
 production and the growing of cereal  
 crops. There are very few sheep today 
 because the woollen industry began to 
 decline over 100 years ago as man made
 fibres and the Commonwealth competed  
 successfully. Very few people who live
 in our town work on the land as       
 farming is now highly mechanised.     
 There are however greater             
 opportunities for agricultural        
 engineers. We have a very successful  
 mushroom farm in Bradford-on-Avon. The
 mushrooms are grown in the tunnels and
 chambers of worked out stone quarries.
 The mushrooms are seeded in compost   
 derived from fermented stable manure  
 imported from racing stables in the   
 Newbury area.
