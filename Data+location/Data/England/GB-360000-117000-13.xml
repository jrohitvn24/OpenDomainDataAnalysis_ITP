		<content>{St. Aldhelm's School}is a Church of   
 England V.C.{co-educational secondary 
{school}with a catchment area of       
 approximately 100 square miles serving
 Sherborne and its surrounding         
 villages. Pupils from the outlying    
 villages are transported into         
 school by a fleet of buses. It was    
 built in 1969 and is situated off the 
 B3145 road at OS ref 639178. It has at
 present approx.{635 pupils on roll }  
 between the ages of 11 and 16. This   
 area of north Dorset retains the      
{eleven-plus selective system}although 
 this may change to a comprehensive    
 system in the near future. If this    
 happens the plans are to enlarge the  
 existing site at St.Aldhelm's. The    
 girls{uniform}colours are navy blue   
 and sky blue; the boys grey and navy  
 blue; the tie for boys and girls is   
 maroon with sky blue stripe.          </content>
