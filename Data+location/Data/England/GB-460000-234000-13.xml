		<content> Miss Ray Cook, a recently retired     
 school teacher is daughter of Winifred
 Cook, nee Watkins, the policeman's    
 daughter one of the few girls who     
 escaped domestic service by attending 
 the Girls High School in Brackley. She
 was born in 1887 and at the turn of   
 the century usually made the 2\ mile  
 journey on foot. Her marriage to      
 Reginald Cook led to her inheriting   
 the village post office and shop still
 the only one in Westbury though with  
 very little for sale today.In the     
 1920's Mr.Cook not only sold          
 provisions, he would also kill one of 
 the 2 pigs which most villagers kept. 
 Alf Robinson was born in 1904 and     
 attended the village school at the age
 of 3.Having worked on farms in his    
 spare time from the age of 10, it was 
 natural to continue there full time   
 when he left school at the age of 13. </content>
