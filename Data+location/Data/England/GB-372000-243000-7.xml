		<title>07MATHON CHURCH.</title>
		<content>   The church at Mathon was first built
 by monks from Evesham abbey who while 
 building it errected a preaching cross
 the base of which still stands outside
 the main door.                        
   In the church yard stands a large   
 yew tree some 22 feet in girth which  
 was planted as a sapling 900 years ago
 by the monks as a symbol of imortality
   A flat stone in front of the church 
 was probably the hiring stone.On      
 quarter days a farmer put a bag of    
 money on the stone and the worker     
 picked it up and had to serve the     
 farmer for 3 months.                  
   When the first Domesday Book was    
 made there was no tower at Mathon     
 church.There was a Norman font        
 at Mathon church but it is no longer  
 there.
