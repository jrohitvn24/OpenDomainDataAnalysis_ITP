		<content>         {Britain in Bloom}            
 Kenton has won the Cox Cup for Britain
 in Bloom in the South West region     
 for the third successive time. We     
 interviewed Kentons warden for the    
 competition. He told us about         
 gardening and judging. We are not     
 surprised that Kenton has won three   
 times as it is a very pretty village. 
 There are lots of trees and the school
 has just planted a hedgerow of        
 twenty-eight trees and bushes. Where  
 ever you walk you always see flowers. 
 The local restaurants have got hanging
 baskets with flowers hanging out of   
 the sides as do many people. The      
 warden explained that the design of   
 the village would not give Kenton any 
 chance of winning the International   
 Competition against the rest of       
 Europe.
