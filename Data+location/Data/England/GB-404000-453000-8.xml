		<content>{The Priory,}founded in 12 century, is 
 mostly in ruins, except for the nave  
 of the church and the gate house.     
 The church has been repaired and      
 restored. The roof and the stained    
 glass windows have been repaired, the 
 floor has been replaced; the organ    
 has been restored; the vestry, the    
 font, and organ console have been     
 moved; and new heating put in. Some   
 of the medieval floor tiles have been 
 laid under the medieval high altar,   
 now near the organ.                   
 The west tower had a roof, windows,   
 and a glass door for the first time,  
 in 1985.                              
 The builders found human bones under  
 the floor.

 Rectory House,and the gate house is a 
{shooting lodge.}                      </content>
