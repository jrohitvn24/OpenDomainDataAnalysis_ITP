 Herbert the Chamberlain seems to have 
 held land and a mill here in the 11th 
 century, part of the estate may be    
 traced to Ingoldfield Farm (613,143). 
 Huntbourn, a purlieu, was described   
 in the 12th century as being "along   
 the highroad from Winton to Portesmues
 close by the Hall of Arred". The track
 can still be seen and evidence of a   
 medieval farm (Harold's Hall) exists  
 at Clays Copse. Hoegate Manor dating  
 from the 16th century is built on a   
 much older site. The farmhouse at     
 Southend (17th C.)was a Jesuit centre 
 and its chapel was demolished in 1959.
 Hoegate Farm is also old, and the     
 farmer is the only person to retain   
 grazing rights on Hoegate Common. The 
 clay areas were more densely wooded   
 than today and Newtown clay has been  
 used at various times for brickmaking.</content>
