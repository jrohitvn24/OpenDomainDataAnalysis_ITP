   Little Cornard is a rural village   
overlooking the Stour Valley.It has no 
real centre as a village except for the
parish church.There is no public house,
no post office, no shops.There is,     
however,a travelling baker,and a       
travelling green grocer who calls once 
a week,and a library van which calls   
once every two weeks.There are three   
milk rounds,and a Sunday paper delivery
.There are several thriving clubs.There
is no school now,but the old school    
building is today used as the village  
hall.There is one telephone kiosk, one 
street light, and one bus shelter.     
  Little Cornard lends its name to the 
well known hymn of the same name,      
composed by Ralph Bourne Williams,     
whilst visiting the village.
