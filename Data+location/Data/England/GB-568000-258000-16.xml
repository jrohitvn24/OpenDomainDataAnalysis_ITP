		<title>16BANSTEAD MANOR STUD VISIT</title>
		<content> We went to Banstead Manor Stud Farm in
 Cheveley, and Mr Morriss, the stud    
 owner showed us round. They breed     
 thoroughbred horses for racing here,  
 and have mares and 2 stallions. It is 
 a public stud because mares are       
 brought in to mate with the stallions.
 This is different from White Lodge    
 Stud in Cheveley because only mares   
 are kept there and these are taken to 
 public studs.                         
 The horses are worth a lot of money   
 and Mr Morriss has made a lot of      
 money. Ten people work on the stud.   
 The farm is 350 acres. The horses eat 
 grass and hay and have vitamins so    
 they can run faster and get strong.   
 The stallions' names are 'Isle de     
 Bourbon' and 'Beldale Flutter'. They  
 are both big and strong and have      
 larger stables than the other horses. 
 Both stallions have won lots of races.</content>
