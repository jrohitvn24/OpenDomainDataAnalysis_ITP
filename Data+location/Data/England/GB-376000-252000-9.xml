      A{dame school}was endowed in 1778
 and was housed in a cottage on the    
 Suckley Road.  The schoolmaster lived 
 in a room partitioned from the school-
 room and was paid an annual salary of 
 Â£15.14s. for teaching the 'three R's' 
 and church catechism.  The school     
 existed until 1861, when a{National   
{School}was built on the site of the   
 present school.  It was a brick and   
 timber building which was extended in 
 1891, when there were 126 children of 
 all ages on roll.  Children then paid 
 two pence per week and one penny was  
 returned if they had full attendance. 
 By 1900 the average roll was 90, in   
 the charge of a master and mistress.  
 The school was demolished in 1932 and 
 replaced by a 'temporary' wooden      
 structure - still in existence!       </content>
