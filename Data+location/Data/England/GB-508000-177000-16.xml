		<content> The area is quiet except for the      
 airport which has planes taking off   
 every minute. The sports ground has   
 facilities for cricket, athletics and 
 football. Harlington Road is busy and 
 has lots of shops and businesses on   
 it. It also has lots of housing. Near 
 Hayes station is a lot of industry.   
 There is a motorway passing through   
 Harlington called the M4. There are   
 sand and gravel works nearby. They    
 take the sand and gravel and use it   
 for something else; then they fill up 
 the pit using waste materials.        
 Outside Harlington is some farmland   
 where they were growing oats and other
 cereal crops.
