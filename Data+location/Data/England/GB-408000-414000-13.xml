		<title>13Longwood Tower.</title>
		<content>    In 1861 Longwood Tower was built by
 a group of local men when they had    
 little work to do. There was a gold   
 plated plaque on the rock face until a
 few years ago when it vanished.       
 Longwood tower is 25 feet high and has
 26 steps to the top. Now Longwood     
 Tower is quiet and deserted although  
 below in Milnsbridge it is busy.      
    By Longwood Tower there is an      
 amphitheatre which was built in 1873  
 and rebuilt in 1930. "Longwood Sing"  
 takes place here, although if it is to
 survive, it needs more singers.       
    At the Longwood Sing they put a    
 flag inside Longwood Tower. It usually
 takes place on a Sunday and the songs 
 they sing are hymns and prayers.      
 Paddock Youth Band sometimes play at  
 the amphitheatre.
