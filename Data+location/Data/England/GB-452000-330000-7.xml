		<content>  Incorporated in the new entrance     
 there are two etched glass windows in 
 memory of Grace Forrest who was the   
 church organist for nearly a quarter  
 of a century.                         
  The Rector has an interesting life   
 because of the variety of people he   
 meets and each day is quite different 
 from the next.                        
  A church newsletter "The Messenger", 
 is compiled and distributed to the    
 villagers each month.Generally,coming 
 events and services are advertised and
 comments of appreciation are          
 published.                            
  The church clock is a good time-     
 keeper,but occasionally it has been   
 known to stop after a storm.
