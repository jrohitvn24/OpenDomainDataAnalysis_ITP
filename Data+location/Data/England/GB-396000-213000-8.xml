		<title>08The wool trade</title>
		<content> Wool was very important to England and
 particularly the Cotswolds.We had more
 wool than we wanted so we exported it.
 Every year shearing was done. It was  
 always a very important time of year  
 for the sheep owners in the Cotwolds. 
 Merchants would buy the wool before it
 was shorn so nobody else would get it.
 So they were taking a risk if the wool
 was not very good but it was usually  
 good.Some times people from{France,   
{Lombards and Flemings}came to buy the 
 wool. Why does the Lord Chancellor sit
 on a sheeps wool sack and not on the  
 lovely seats like every one else? The 
 reason is that the wool sack stands   
 for the wool trade which shows wool   
 was very important for the country.
