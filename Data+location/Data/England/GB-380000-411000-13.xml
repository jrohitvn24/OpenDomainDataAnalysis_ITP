		<title>13 Bury Tip</title>
		<content>  Our school wall backs on to Bury tip.
 In the Summer we could not open our   
 classroom windows because of the awful
{smells}that used to come from the tip.
  We also used to get covered in a fine
{grey dust}that blew off the top of the
 tip. It used to get in your eyes and  
 it hurt. Sometimes we could not go out
 at break because of the dust and      
 smells. In winter the rubbish used to 
 blow around the school.               
                                       
  All this has changed now because of a
 brand new{compactor plant}which       
 replaces the tip. Five men work the   
 plant and all the rubbish is tipped   
 straight into skips and pushed under  
 great pressure into a new skip. It is 
 driven away to Wigan where it is      
 treated and got rid off. This Summer  
 has been very pleasant for us.
