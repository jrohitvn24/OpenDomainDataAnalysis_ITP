		<content> Its Monday morning. 7.30 I'm up and   
 ready! I go downstairs and have toast 
 for{breakfast.}I get my things for    
 school and my Mum takes my brother    
 David and me up to school. It takes us
 20 minutes to get there but we still  
 have time to play before the bell at  
 9.00. Maths and Language work in the  
 morning and playtime at 10.30.{       
{Assembly}is at 10.45 and Zig Zag, a TV
 programme, is at 11.00. Lunch at 12.  
 then out to play again. At 3.15 we go 
 home, then I play with Helen, my best 
 friend. We read or play indoors or    
 watch TV. My favourite television     
 programme is 'Top of the Pops'.       
 I go to bed at 9 o'clock and sometimes
 I read a story to my brother. He      
 is 7 and his favourite story is called
 'The Clever Monkey'.
