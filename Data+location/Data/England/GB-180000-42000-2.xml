		<content> The average school day for children is
 to get up between 7am and 8am; have   
 breakfast; go to school; lunch at     
 school or at home; leave for home at  
 3.50, walking or by car or bus; do    
 homework before or after tea,and play,
 watch TV or go out; in bed by 10 to   
 11pm. At weekends they are allowed out
 till 11 or 12pm. In the holidays some 
 sleep late; others help around the    
 house, and depending on transport and 
 weather, stay in and watch TV, listen 
 to tapes or records or go to town or  
 beach or just play/talk with friends. 
 Some get jobs or have to work for     
 pocket money at home.There is great   
 contrast in children's minds between  
 the happiness of early childhood and  
 difficulties experienced in families  
 when growing up, especially in the    
 teenage years.
