		<title>16MELSONBY-The Parish Council</title>
		<content>  The  {Parish Council}  consists of a 
 Chairman,   Secretary   and   four    
 Councillors,  all of whom  except the 
 Secretary  are {appointed  by  secret 
{ballot  of  the  local electorate,}to 
 serve for a term of five years.       
  There has been no need for elections 
 of these  Councillors in Melsonby for 
 many years now because there are  only
 enough people  willing to take office 
 as there are places to fill.          
  Parish  Councils  have  very  little 
 power, {most} of  the  more{important 
{decisions }affecting our village such 
 as planning, social &amp; welfare         
 services,   housing   and   general   
 environment are{taken by Richmondshire
{District Council.} The  Parish Council
 looks after such things as maintenance
 of  the  village green   and   playing
 fields.                               
                                       </content>
