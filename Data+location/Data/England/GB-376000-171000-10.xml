		<title>10ECOLOGY IN MARSHFIELD</title>
		<content> Flora and fauna are typical of the    
 South Cotswolds.  Interesting flora   
 include the Meadow Saffron, plentiful 
 in the autumn, and the Bee Orchid, at 
 one site only.  Birds are those of an 
 upland area: Kestrel, Sparrow Hawk,   
 Buzzard, Magpie and Skylark.  Grey    
 Partridge and Pheasant are common most
 years. A local rarity is the Quail,   
 present from May to October, breeding 
 being restricted by farming methods   
 and the wet summer of 1985. A rare    
 visitor is the Hobby. Among the larger
 mammals are the Red Fox and the       
 Badger, both fairly common despite    
 hunting &amp; persecution. Recently the   
 Roe Deer has spread into the area from
 Wiltshire, and an exotic species of   
 deer, the Muntjac, is found at times. 
 Winter can be severe, with roads often
 blocked by drifting snow. Noise from  
 military planes can be a nuisance.    </content>
