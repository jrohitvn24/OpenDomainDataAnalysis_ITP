        The largest settlement still is
 Goring, with W. Ferring and Durrington
 in particular being contrastingly     
 small. Northbrook farm and Ecclesdon  
 farm were mapped.  There were three   
 woods, one of which stretches across  
 where today there is a road.

        The village of Hangleton had by
 now become large enough to map,       
 emerging alongside the main road.  The
 development of Ferring was of note    
 which had now split into east and     
 west.  Some woods had been cleared    
 near Highdown and a few settlements   
 had emerged.
