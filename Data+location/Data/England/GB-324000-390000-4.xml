		<content>                                       
 This pond is in the shape of a number 
 eight.                                
 It is about twenty metres long and    
 twelve wide .                         
                                       
 It is used for fishing by the people  
 who live nearby. The fish that can be 
 caught there are carp, tench, bream,  
 perch , roach and rudd.               
                                       
 The fishermen said that the deepest   
 part was three metres deep, but most  
 of it is two metres deep.             
                                       
 There were seven people fishing when  
 we went on a Wednesday afternoon in   
 June.                                 
                                       
 The pond is in very low lying land.It 
 is between Squibb's Factory and Fender
 Valley Farm.                          </content>
