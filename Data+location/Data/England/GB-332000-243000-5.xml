		<content> Visitors may stay at the Red Lion     
 Inn and at Bredwardine Hall Guest     
 House, and there are two holiday      
 cottages in Brobury. Holiday-makers   
 visit the area to see places mentioned
 in 'Kilvert's Diary'. One of these is 
 the Knapp, a prominent hill to the    
 west, topped by beeches in Kilvert's  
 time; these are now dead and have     
 been replaced with oaks by local      
 people. Kilvert was Rector in         
 Bredwardine at the time of his death  
 in 1879; he lies buried in the        
 churchyard. Other tourist attractions 
 include fishing and walking; there are
 few public footpaths but very good    
 walks on the hill-tops. There is an   
 Outdoor Centre at Bredwardine Lodge   
 which caters for young people with    
 instruction in canoeing and other     
 outdoor pursuits. Moccas Court and    
 Brobury House are also of interest.   </content>
