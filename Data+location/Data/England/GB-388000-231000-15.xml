		<content>  As a shift worker for Severn Trent   
 Water Authority,my day can start very 
 early in the morning or late at night.
  When I work the 6am _2pm shift I wake
 at 4-30am to have breakfast and       
 prepare for the 7 miles car journey to
 work.                                 
  My responsibilities at work are to   
 monitor the volume of water through   
 various stages of treatment and at    
 specific places dose the raw water    
 with chemicals e.g.chlorine lime etc. 
 so that it is fit for humans to drink.
  Depending on the condition of the    
 River Severn ie.running high/low,     
 muddy or clear etc. my day can be     
 hectic or reasonably calm. I do not   
 have a set lunch break,rather I take  
 it when the situation allows. I cook  
 my meals using the electric cooker in 
 the mess room. By 1.45pm I am more    
 than eager to prepare to return home. </content>
