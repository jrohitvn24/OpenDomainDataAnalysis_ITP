		<content> "I like Stainland because of the      
 sports facilities." (Mark Mallinson). 
 "I like living in Stainland because   
 there are lots of things to do.I      
 go to Brownies,  I like going there   
 because it takes up my time in a      
 useful way." (Jane Mawer). "I like    
 Stainland because there's lots to do  
 and see." (Fiona Webster).            
      There are two bus routes which   
 run through Stainland, one goes up to 
 Outlane before returning to Halifax,  
 the other turns round in Stainland and
 returns to Halifax. This makes Halifax
 the easiest town to visit for         
 Stainland villagers.                  
      In Stainland and its surrounding 
 area many of the families can trace   
 back their local connections for many 
 generations.
