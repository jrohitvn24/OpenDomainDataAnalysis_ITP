		<title>08MINTSFEET TRADING ESTATE</title>
		<content>{ Mintsfeet}is so named as it is at    
 the foot of the river{Mint,}a tribut- 
 ary of the{Kent.}Not so long ago,     
 Mintsfeet was a marshy flood plain.   
 The land was sold very cheaply to a   
 group of men who put marl into the    
 marshland. Now a lot of the earlier   
 buildings such as ATS Tyre Services   
 have cracks in their walls caused by  
 subsidence and substandard foundations
 Newer buildings are built on much     
 deeper foundations that are able to   
 hold the weight of the new buildings. 
 The main part of Kendal's industrial  
 wholesalers reside on the trading     
 estate. These{include}mainly motor    
 showrooms, foodstores, garages,The    
 Milk Marketing Board &amp; Farley Health.
