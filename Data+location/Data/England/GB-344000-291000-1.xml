		<title>01CHURCH STRETTON AREA</title>
		<content>  {Church Stretton, Hope Bowdler,      
{Little Stretton, Chelmick, Soudley and
{Ragdon are in our Domesday block.}The 
 area is very hilly, almost mountainous
 in fact. With the many hills and      
 scattered communities it is not       
 surprising the area is so popular with
 tourists. The windswept moorland and  
 relatively little arable farmland     
 seems a strange mixture to attract    
 tourists.                             
   The area appeals to the elderly and 
 many retire here. The main reason for 
 the lack of young people is the lack  
 of work. It also costs a lot to live  
 here, the houses are very expensive.  
   The area is served by the small     
 market town of Church Stretton.       
 The town boasts a reasonable shopping 
 centre. Here you can buy almost every 
 thing you might need.
