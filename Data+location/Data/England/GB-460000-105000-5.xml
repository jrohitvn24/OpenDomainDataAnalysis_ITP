		<content> Locally, he sees the important issues 
 as firstly, the preservation of the   
 important conservation areas and      
 historic buildings, secondly the      
 preservation of open spaces and lastly
 the preservation of a high standard of
 education.                            
 In the future he hopes personally to  
 continue living an interesting life   
 and not stagnate and to see           
 Portchester keep a friendly           
 atmosphere.                           
 During his lifetime he sees our       
 greatest loss to be that of           
 self-sufficiency through the          
 introduction of government schemes    
 which have caused a feeling of        
 complacency and dependency on others.
