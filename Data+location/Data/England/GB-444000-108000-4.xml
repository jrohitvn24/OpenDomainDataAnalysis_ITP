		<title>04Weston Shore</title>
		<content>   The shore at Weston has a long      
 shingle beach and looks out over the  
 famous Southampton Water.The beach    
 itself isn't exactly clean but on the 
 other hand it's not too bad and many  
 people go fishing or sailing or sail  
 boarding along the shore.             
   Once people would have looked out   
 from here to watch the ships coming   
 and going from Southampton but now    
 there are few ships to watch.With     
 leisure activities growing though     
 there are many things to see happening
 along the shore ,especially at        
 weekends.                             
   Behind the open space along the     
 shoreline is the Weston Council estate
 with 5 giant blocks of flats looking  
 out over the water.You need a good    
 view because it's lonely living up in 
 the sky.
