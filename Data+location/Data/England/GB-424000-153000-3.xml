 There are 281 houses in the area. Of  
 these 79 are owned by the Kennet      
 District Council,21 are tied to a     
 job,and 181 are privately owned. Fifty
 one of the properties are bungalows   
 and 12 are maisonettes.               
 Building styles vary in the village   
 and a variety of materials have been  
 used. Many of the older houses were   
 built of flint with thatched roofs;   
 there are still a few houses with cob 
 and wattle and daub walls.A group of  
 these older houses can be seen in     
 Sunton, and it is hoped to keep this  
 section of the village unspoilt.      
 Some plans have been sent in to build 
 more houses but most of the villagers 
 think that there are enough houses    
 already. Others feel that houses for  
 young families should be built as     
 young people now have to move away.   </content>
