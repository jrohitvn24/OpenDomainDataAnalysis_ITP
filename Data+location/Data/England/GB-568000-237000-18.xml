		<title>18STAMBOURNE NEWSLETTER</title>
		<content>  The parish newsletter is published by
 the Parish Council. It is a 4-page    
 duplicated leaflet, prepared and      
 distributed by volunteers. It appears 
 bi-monthly. It contains reports and   
 notices of Parish Council meetings,   
 and reports and announcements from all
 the other village organisations       
 including the church and chapel. It   
 does not carry commercial advertising 
 although it supports the 'Use it or   
 Lose it' campaign for village shops   
 and Post Offices. The newsletter      
 provides a valuable channel of        
 communication for village             
 organisations.
