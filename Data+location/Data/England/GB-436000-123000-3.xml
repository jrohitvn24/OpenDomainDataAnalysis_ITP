		<title>03SHOPPING IN BRAISHFIELD</title>
		<content> There are two general stores in the   
 village of Braishfield, one of which  
 contains the Post Office. Both are    
 used mainly by older members of the   
 village who have no means of          
 transport,and by passing trade.       
 There is a small retail counter       
 selling car accessories, engine oils, 
 and confectionery at the              
 garage/filling station                
 Villagers who own vehicles, mostly    
 prefer to shop in the larger stores   
 which are to be found in              
 Romsey, Southampton, Stockbridge, or  
 Winchester.
