		<title>15Transport around Paulerspury</title>
		<content>In 1985 there are regular bus services 
between the village and the popular    
shopping centres of Milton Keynes and  
Northampton.  United Counties buses    
leave Paulerspury for Milton Keynes at 
10.23 and 13.03 and for Northampton at 
7.35, 9.11, 12.15 and 14.20.           
Fourteen people were interviewed. Three
of them used the bus, seven used their 
own car, one shared a car and three    
used bicycles to get out of the        
village.                               
The School, the Good Neighbours and the
Senior Citizens use private coach firms
for their outings.
