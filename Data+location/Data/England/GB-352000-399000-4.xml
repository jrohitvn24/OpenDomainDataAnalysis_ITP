		<title>04TWINNING ASSOCIATION</title>
		<content>  The Seneley Green twinning           
 association was formed 6 years ago in 
 1979,because people thought it would  
 be nice to know more about a foreign  
 country.The twin town is called       
 Nienhagen,it is near Celle in Germany.
 To decide which town to twin with     
 there was a vote in which all the     
 public could join.It was Germany that 
 won the vote that's why we are twinned
 with them.The public think it's good  
 experience having German's in their   
 house.The houses in Germany have      
 cellars and are different from our    
 houses.The Germans think that Garswood
 is alright.The dancing school and     
 swimming club have visited Germany    
 once.The association think that it's a
 good idea being twinned with a foreign
 town because you learn each others    
 values and see how they live.The      
 association is now very sucessful.    </content>
