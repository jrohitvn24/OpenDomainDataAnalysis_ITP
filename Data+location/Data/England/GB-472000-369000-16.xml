 For many years visitors came to       
 Tuxford by horse drawn coaches.  The  
 village became famous as a resting    
 place for weary travellers on their   
 way from London to Edinburgh.  But, on
 l5th July, l852 a new and faster      
 visitor arrived, the steam locomotive.
  The railway brought many important   
 people to Tuxford.  In l886, the      
 Prince of Wales, (later King Edward   
 VII) got off his Royal Train and      
 passed through Tuxford on his way to  
 Rufford.  All the boys from the       
 Grammar School, and almost every      
 villager stood and waved to the       
 prince.  In the l93O's, trains such as
 the Flying Scotsman passed through    
 Tuxford and Tuxford had its own goods 
 depot and four stations!  Nowadays    
 there are no railway stations at      </content>
