		<title>09LANDRAKE FARM CONTINUED</title>
		<content> Mr.Brewer and his son who work Pound  
 Farm,Landrake,have a long day.They    
 start at 07.30 and continue until     
 18.00 every day.Their labourer works  
 a 5 day week,viz.40 hours.            
 The land was bought by the present    
 owner's father in 1905,who described  
 it as "greatful land" because it was  
 so productive.Today fertilisers are   
 added to maintain crop yields.        
 The crops are grown for animal fodder 
 -barley,turnip,kale and rape.The straw
 is used as bedding.                   
 There are very few trees on the       
 farm,only twenty oaks in each of the  
 two copses.There are of course        
 hedgerow trees.                       
 As the farm buildings are on one side 
 of the main road,it is necessary for  
 the animals to be driven across to the
 other side.It becomes real country    
 when sheep move through the village!  </content>
