		<title>12Halling By-Pass</title>
		<content>   In Lower Halling a By-Pass is being 
 built to make Halling much quieter.The
 main road is very busy because the    
 traffic uses it as a link between the 
 M20 and the M2.There are very few     
 bridges over the River Medway and     
 Halling is between the busy bridges at
 Rochester and those at Aylesford and  
 Maidstone.                            
   There are bridges on the By-Pass,two
 road bridges and a footbridge.One road
 bridge is already open and the        
 footbridge is nearly finished.Some men
 working on it were in a crane and they
 knocked down an electricity cable.They
 had to repair it.                     
   We went down to look when the       
 workmen started digging the first part
 of the road.They knocked down part of 
 the recreation ground.It looked       
 bare.They also knocked down a few     
 houses,a pub and a club.              </content>
