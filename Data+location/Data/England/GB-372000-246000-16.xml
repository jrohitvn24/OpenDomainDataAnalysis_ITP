		<title>165 YEAR OLD'S DAY IN CRADLEY.</title>
		<content> When I get up in the morning, an alarm
 clock wakes me up.I have breakfast,   
 then my uncle takes me to school. When
 I get to school,I take my lunch-box   
 in.Then it's time for the register and
 then all the children say if they're  
 there and then we do some work. When  
 we've done it,we have our milk then go
 out to play.When the bell goes we come
 in.Then we do some more work until    
 playtime.I like maths best.           
 On hot days we have a picnic on the   
 tables on the field.We play there.In  
 the afternoon ,I go swimming.I like to
 walk around in the water with my arms 
 on my floats.We go home,then I watch  
 television.If there is nothing else I 
 want to watch,I turn it off and play  
 with my sister.On Monday, I always    
 watch "The Incredible Hulk", then I   
 have supper and brush my teeth and go 
 to bed.                               </content>
