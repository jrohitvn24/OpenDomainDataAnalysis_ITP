		<title>17THE LIFE OF A 9 YEAR OLD</title>
		<content> My name is Darren Crush. I like to    
 play football, cricket and watch TV.  
 My Mum used to be a nurse but then she
 retired and became a nurse in the     
 Harlaxton Manor. My Father used to be 
 in the RAF but he retired early and   
 started to work for the Welbys and now
 he is a land agent. I have two sisters
 called Emma and Carrie. My house has  
 six rooms, 3 bedrooms one kitchen and 
 a lounge. Our house looks very old my 
 Dad said it is five hundred years old.
 It is made of old stone. We have      
 central heating in every room. In the 
 morning I wake up and go to the       
 toilet, wash and brush my teeth and   
 have my breakfast. I get dressed the  
 get ready for school. I play outside  
 then when the bell goes we go inside  
 and get our homework marked and have a
 quiet reading session.
