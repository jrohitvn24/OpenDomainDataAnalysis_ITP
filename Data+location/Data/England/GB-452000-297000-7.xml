		<content>     In our area a lot of building is  
 going on.More and more farmland being 
 turned over so people can have houses.
 Because there is quite a bit of       
 countryside here,close to the         
 villages, it makes an ideal place for 
 building.Most of the building is going
 on in Narborough and Enderby although 
 there is some in Whetstone.           
    The builders work from 9am to 5pm. 
 Their work is very noisy.Most of the  
 houses are made from brick,mortar and 
 wood.In some,the structure is wood and
 they build brick around.              
    Apart from the houses, they are    
 building roads.First they put some    
 gravel for foundations,rolling it down
 firmly.When that is done, they pour in
 the tarmac and smooth it down.        
    In a year or so the area will be   
 unrecognisable.
