 in the parish of Meopham and the      
 district of Gravesham in Kent.  From  
 being mainly agricultural it has come 
 into the commuter belt and is within  
 easy reach of the M2, M20 and M25/26.

 and tracks attracts walkers and horse 
 riders and there are several areas    
 with spectacular views which are      
 visited by tourists.  There is a small

 Necessary services are within reach   
 but residents need their own transport
 as bus services are minimal.  The area
 has planning restrictions which       
 protect it from exploitation by       
 developers, and residents and visitors
 alike appreciate the peaceful rural   
 atmosphere of Harvel.
