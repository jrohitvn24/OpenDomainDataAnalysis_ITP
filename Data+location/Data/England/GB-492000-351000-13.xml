		<title>13ENTERTAINMENT IN LEADENHAM</title>
		<content> Leadenham Players was formed in       
 1980.There had previously been a group
 of villagers who had performed        
 pantomines in the village hall with   
 the very limited facilities.Growing   
 interest,and the arrival of an ex     
 professional actress prompted the     
 forming of the company.The first job  
 was to build a stage.Curtains,lights  
 and a piano were bought from funds    
 raised by a raffle.It was felt that   
 one production a year was not enough. 
 A summer revue was a second venture.  
 From revue material the group has     
 progressed to short plays and taking  
 part in local drama festivals.Now     
 there are 20 adult members with the   
 local primary school children joining.
 New ventures are tried as the group's 
 ability improves.The Players provide a
 focus for like minded people and      
 welcome entertainment for the Village.</content>
