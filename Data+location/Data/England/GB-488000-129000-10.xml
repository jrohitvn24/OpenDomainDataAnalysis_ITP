		<content>    The Rev. James Fielding became     
 Vicar of Haslemere in 1786. He lived  
 for a time at Chase Farm. Parson      
 Fielding, as he was known, was a      
 notorious highwayman, robbing         
 coaches on the Portsmouth Road (now   
 the A3).                              
    At Chase Farm a brass plate of a   
 mailbag was later found, which proved 
 he was never convicted.               
    James Mangles the diarist lived at 
 Valewood House in 1850 .In his diary  
 he kept a record of his conversations 
 with the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson.   
 This diary was lost for some years but
 rediscovered in the laundry room at   
 Valewood House in 1970.               
    Helen Allingham, the 19th century  
 water colour artist, lived and painted
 in this area. Among her pictures was  
 one of Fleur de Lys cottage next to   
 Jesse Mann's Do-it-Yourself shop.     </content>
