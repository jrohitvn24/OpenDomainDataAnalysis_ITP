		<content> In Great and Litle Raveley and Wistow 
 mobile libraries are welcome visitors,
 calling once a month, they bring      
 leisure reading and information.      
 Television is part of most homes,     
 giving access to local and national   
 information.  If the television is    
 equipped with a Teletext facility     
 information is available from the     
 CEEFAX and ORACLE data bases.  Local  
 and national radio networks give a    
 comprehensive coverage of information,
 current affairs and music.  There are 
 a few households in the area that have
 their own micro-computors, used for   
 business and leisure activities. The  
 Royal Mail operate a postal service,  
 delivering daily, except Sunday, thus 
 allowing for information to be gained 
 by correspondence, plus news of a     
 personal nature.  The telephone is    
 also a valuable source of information.</content>
