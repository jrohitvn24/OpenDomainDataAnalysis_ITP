		<title>17Higham Farm</title>
		<content>  When we went to Higham Farm to see   
 the lady there, she was very busy     
 because the man had unexpectedly      
 turned up to{shear the sheep. }He was 
 using electric clippers, and she was  
 helping by getting the next sheep     
 ready.  Each sheep took a very short  
 time, and the fleece was tied up with-
 out a string because that would damage
 the{machinery}that would be used on   
 it.  One of the three dogs was a      
{sheepdog,}and rounded up some sheep   
 very cleverly when they escaped.      
  We walked through the farmyard and we
 saw the pond: there were three cats   
 and three geese.  One of the geese was
 laying.                               
  They have a lot of sheep and some    
 cattle for fattening.  The farm's{oast
 has no roof and is not in use except  
 for storage.                          
                                       </content>
