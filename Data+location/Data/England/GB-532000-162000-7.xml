		<title>07SHOPS IN S.CROYDON</title>
		<content> There are a wide variety of shops in  
 our area.We have got a lot of         
 newsagents and antique shops.We have  
 got quite a few pubs,such as the Red  
 Deer,the Purley Arms,the Windsor      
 castle and the Royal Oak.We have got a
 lot of garages and a lot of non_food  
 shops.There are six D.I.Y. shops and  
 four restaurants.We also have eleven  
 food shops.                           
 There are lots of shops on the        
 Brighton Road, which is the main road 
 through Croydon,because this is where 
 most of the traffic is and so they get
 more customers than if they were in a 
 side street.There are also some snack 
 bars and take_away food               
 shops,particularly for the lunchtime  
 trade.
