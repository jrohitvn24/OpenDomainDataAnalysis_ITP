		<title>08VIEWS ON GILDERSOME</title>
		<content>{My name is Michael Richardson and I am
 11 years old.I was born on 12-5-74 and
 I have lived in Gildersome all my     
 life.I live at 27,Harthill in a semi- 
 detached house and I have one brother 
 and sister who have both left school.I
 am in my final year at Birchfield J&amp;I 
 School.In September I start at Brunt- 
 cliffe High School.I play football for
 school and for a local junior soccer  
 team called Gildersome Spurs.I go     
 training once a week and play football
 at the weekend.On Wednesday night I go
 to Boys Brigade.                      
{I like Gildersome because there are a 
 lot of things to do for children of my
 age.There is a park for little child- 
 ren although I think it could be a    
 little larger.I think that Gildersome 
 should have a few more shops and is   
 badly in need of a cafe.
