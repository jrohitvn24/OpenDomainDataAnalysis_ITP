		<title>04WAYSIDE CROSSES</title>
		<content> There are three crosses and they are  
 all made out of granite rock and they 
 are to tell the pilgrims where to stop
 and rest so that they could see the   
 church. The crosses don't have any    
 words on them. The cross at the top of
{Winson Hill}is two and a half metres  
 tall and sixteen centimetres wide.    
 Winson Cross is near Winson Farm. It  
 is on the main road. Just down the    
 side road near Stuart's house there is
 a well. It used to be a spring. This  
 was where{Saint Urith}fell. They cut  
 her down with scythes.                
 There could have been more crosses in 
 the area on each of the roads into    
 Chittlehampton at the places where    
 pilgrims could see the Tower of       
 Chittlehampton Church for the first   
 time. The three crosses that are left 
 are in the churchyard, at Winson and  
 at Eastacott (grid ref.02620123)      </content>
