   The Main feature in our 'D' block is
 the A1 or the Great North Road which  
 runs in a north south direction on the
 map.It is the main road linking London
 to Edingburgh.                        
    There are other important transport
 routes,including the Ermine Street ( A
 Roman road) and the main London to    
 Edingburgh railway line.The river     
 Witham also flows through this area in
 its infant stage.                     
   The 'D'  block area is predominantly
 rural with two small villages (Great  
 and Little Ponton) and scattered      
 farms.Most of the land is used for    
 arable farming ,although there are    
 several dairy herds in the Witham     
 valley.There are also several areas of
 woodland mainly made up of deciduous  
 trees although Boothby Great Wood has 
 a managed coniferous plantation.      </content>
