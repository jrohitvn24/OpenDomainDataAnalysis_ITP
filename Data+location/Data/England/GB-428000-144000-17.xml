		<title>17AMPORT HOUSE.</title>
		<content>  Amport House was built in 1857 and   
 was the home of the Marquesses of     
 Winchester until it was sold at the   
 end of World War 1. During the        
 'thirties it was owned by Col. Sofer- 
 Whitburn until, in 1939, it became the
 Headquarters of RAF Maintenance       
 Command. The H.Q. moved to Andover in 
 1961 and the house is now the RAF     
 Chaplains' School. It is an imposing, 
 gabled Victorian mansion in the       
 Elizabethan style standing amid park- 
 land that includes two redwood trees, 
 cedars and copper beeches. Part of the
 garden is old. The knot garden depicts
 details from the Paulet family's coats
 of arms. The avenues of pleached limes
 are fascinating. The house's main     
 facade faces south, overlooking the   
 grdens laid out by Sir Edwin Lutyens, 
 advised by Gertrude Jekyll. Ponds,    
 canals, lawns &amp; beds slope to a ha-ha.</content>
