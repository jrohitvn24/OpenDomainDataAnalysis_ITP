		<title>02SAINT ALDHELM'S WELL.</title>
		<content>{St. Aldhelm's Well}is found in a small
 coppice in the vicarage grounds.The   
 water flows out from under two stone  
 arches which are built into the solid 
 rock.In front of the arches is along  
 narrow channel which is lined by      
 dressed stone.There are signs that the
 well and channel were once covered by 
 a roofed building.This was believed to
 have then been used as a bath for     
 pilgrims who went there for the       
 water's reputed healing               
 qualities.A local story says that     
{St. Aldhelm}did penance there by      
 sitting in the well whilst            
 reciting The Psalter.The spring       
 provides a constant supply of         
 excellent water and has never been    
 known to dry up.The well forms the    
 source of the{River Sheppey,}which in 
 Saxon times was known as{Doulting     
{River.                                </content>
