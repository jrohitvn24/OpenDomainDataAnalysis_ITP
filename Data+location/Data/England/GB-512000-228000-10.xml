		<title>10EAST LODGE LITTLE OFFLEY</title>
		<content> Nine chickens are kept in the yard,fed
 from the small amount of grain        
 escaping from the sacks carried on the
 lorries.He keeps several ducks for    
 their eggs, and two dogs to guard the 
 house and land.                       
 The house was originally two cottages,
 joined together in 1968,by the removal
 of a wall.The workshop was constructed
 in 1981.The following year the house  
 was damaged by lightning.It is        
 centrally heated,with four bedrooms   
 all modern conveniences e.g.'phone,   
 television,and stereo.The family do   
 any shopping in Hitchin but do not use
 the limited sports facilities in the  
 area.They do not go to church but     
 occasionally use the local 'pub'.     
  This is an example of family using   
 all available resources in a fairly   
 rural area,with very few amenities.
