		<title>13HOME IMPROVEMENTS</title>
		<content> Quite a few of the people who have    
 bought the council houses that they   
 live in have carried out{home         
{improvements}or extensions to there   
 homes.So have some of the people who  
 live in privatly built houses.        
  These improvements are things like   
 refitting a kitchen, bigger jobs      
 include building a garage or extending
 an existing room,or adding on another 
 room downstairs.  Before one of these 
 big jobs can be done a plan has to be 
 made and submitted to the council.Only
 when the council have given{planning  
{permission}can work start.            
  A lot of people do the work          
 themselves,although some people do get
 firms to carry out the work for       
 them.At certain stages during the     
 building the work has to be{inspected 
 to make sure that it is being done    
 properly.                             </content>
