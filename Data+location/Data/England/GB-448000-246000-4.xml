		<title>04CHIPPING WARDEN YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content>The youth club started in November 1983
and is held every Monday night in the  
school canteen. At the youth club they 
play games like snooker and table      
tennis and darts. They have to be 11   
before  they can join. Sometimes they  
go on trips like badminton and swimming
and it is good fun. They have sweets   
and Panda pops as well. There are about
30 members and they pay 20p. a week. If
the weather is nice they sometimes     
play rounders. Not long ago they bought
a record player. A man came from       
Northampton and played indoor hockey.  
Everyone enjoyed it. The people who run
the youth club are Mr and Mrs Grigson, 
Mrs Buckingham, Mrs Turner and Mr      
Rogers.
