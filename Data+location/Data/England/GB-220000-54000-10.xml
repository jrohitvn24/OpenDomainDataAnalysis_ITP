		<content>  Until 1957 the CofE school was all   
 age(5-15),but since then it has become
 a junior&amp;infant C.P school(5-11) with 
 an average of 80 children on roll.    
 At 11 the children go to Looe         
 Comprehensive,thereafter(for those who
 wish it)to a 6th form college at      
 Liskeard ora College of Further       
 Education at St Austell.              
  In 1984 the first phase of a new     
 school was completed housing 1 class.2
 other classes are situated in         
 temporary huts.The staff consists of a
 teaching head,2 assistants and a part 
 time teacher.An ancillary is employed 
 to help with children with problems.  
 At present the school is helping to   
 develop a scheme of cooperation among 
 6 small schools in an attempt to      
 broaden the curriculum.               
  There is no provision for nursery    
 education,but there is a playgroup.   </content>
