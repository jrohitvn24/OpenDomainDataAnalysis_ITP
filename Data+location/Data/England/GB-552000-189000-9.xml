		<content> We did a survey of 100 families with  
 children to find out the jobs that the
 men did.We found that 29 people in our
 survey were drivers of some           
 sort-lorries,ice-cream vans,taxis     
 etc.There were 14 people woking in    
 factories making anything from        
 curtains to cars.Only two of these    
 worked in Fords at Dagenham making    
 cars,although at one time a lot of    
 people in this area worked            
 there.Twenty-one people did jobs      
 connected with the building trade,such
 as tilers,brick-layers etc.The rest of
 the men had the following-8 worked in 
 an office,7 worked in shops,3 on buses
 or trains,2 were gardeners,2          
 electricians,1 was a manager of a     
 snooker club and 1 worked at the      
 British Museum.Twelve men were out of 
 work because they had been made       
 redundant.                            </content>
