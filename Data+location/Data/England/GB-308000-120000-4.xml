		<title>04THE CANAL</title>
		<content> The stretch of the Great Weston canal 
 which runs though  our area opened    
 in 1838 and was closed in 1864.It     
 ran from Taunton through Nynehead,    
 Wellington,Thorn St Margaret, Holcombe
 Rogus to Tiverton.The narrow boats    
 which transported cargoes of coal,    
 lime stone and stone were only 1.8    
 meters  wide and 6.1 meters long while
 the canal itself was only 2.1 meters  
 wide. At Thore St Margaret there was  
 an incine where  it wasnt possible to 
 build a lock because of the lack of   
 water. A lift was buit instead  which 
 consisted  of a cage on wheels that   
 carried the boats  up the incline.The 
 cage was operated by a steam engine,  
 house in a building at the upper      
 leval.The canal is now filled in but  
 the towpath along which the horses    
 walked that pulled the longboats,still
 exists as a public path.              </content>
