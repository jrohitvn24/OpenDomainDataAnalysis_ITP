 originally called Vardys. It was      
 founded over 40 years ago. It started 
 with a horse and cart delivering coal,
 then 10 years ago it developed into a 
{transport business.}It had fleet of   
 tipper lorries and used to move coal  
 from the colleries to the power       
 station. It was then changed to become
 a furniture business delivering new   
 furniture from factories to shops.    
 Instead of carrying other peoples     
 furniture they decided to import      
 furniture and to sell to the shops    
 themselves. They now{import}furniture 
 from Germany, Hungary, Denmark and    
 Israel, their main import being
