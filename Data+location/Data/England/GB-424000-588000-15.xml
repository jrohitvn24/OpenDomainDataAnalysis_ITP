		<content>{ Ashington Veterans Institute and Area
 Ashington Veterans Institute was      
 formed in 1938. It has about 93       
 members and the recreation available  
 is pool, snooker, cards, dominoes and 
 similar games. Other things in the    
 grid include a Mineral Railway Line,  
 Government Buildings which include an 
 Unemployment Benifit Office, Probate  
 Office, Probation Office, Womens Royal
 Voluntary Service, Local Tribunal     
 Office. These buildings were adapted  
 from living accomodation used by      
 displaced workers after World War Two.
 Also nearby is a large area used as   
 allotments (small garden plots) used  
 for kitchen produce or the keeping of 
 pigeons and domestic poultry. Nearby  
 there is some buildings which used to 
 belong to the colliery for stables for
 the pit ponies, but they are now used 
 for workshops.                        </content>
