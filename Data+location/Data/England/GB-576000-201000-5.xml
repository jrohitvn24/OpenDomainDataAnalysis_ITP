 BICKNACRE                             
 In 1913 a group of people,eager to    
 help{lepers}who had contracted the    
 disease in the Empire,met an Essex    
 farmer who wanted to sell 27 acres for
 Â£1500.One of the group,John           
 Burns,visited his friend,Lord         
 Strathcona,who left them the money in 
 his will. The hospital &amp; homes of     
 St.Giles were established,consisting  
 of a group of bungalows set in open   
 countryside,with a chapel and         
 cemetary. Leprosy patients were cared 
 for by the Brothers of Divine         
 Compassion until 1942,when Anglican   
 Nuns took over. They retired in       
 December 1984. Today there are 9      
 patients-not contagious.The{          
{Springboard Housing Association}are   
 turning it into a community for       
 vulnerable and handicapped people.    </content>
