		<title>03THE CASTLE,HORNBY</title>
		<content> The castle was built in the 13th      
 century.It was built by the St.       
 Quintens.It was built as a stately    
 home not as a fighting castle.At that 
 time most stately homes,churches and  
 manor houses were built with          
 battlements.In the 18th century the   
 castle was altered.In those days it   
 belonged to the Duke of Leeds.He owned
 it until 1930 when it was sold.Then   
 some parts of it were pulled down as  
 they were unsafe.The castle has many  
 fields and gardens around it.Today the
 castle is lived in by Major-General   
 Clutterbuck and his family.It is not  
 at present open to the public but it  
 is used for special village occasions 
 especially those associated with the  
 church.
