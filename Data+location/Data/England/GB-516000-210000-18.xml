		<title>18The Kennels, Coleman Green</title>
		<content> The Boarding Kennel has accomodation  
 for 120 dogs at Â£3.75 a night. Smaller
 dogs share accomodation with 1 or 2   
 others but larger dogs have single    
 kennels.  Bedding, which is changed   
 daily,is usually straw or newspaper   
 and sawdust. Dogs with a thick coat   
 have little bedding as they would get 
 too hot. The dogs are fed on tinned   
 dogfood and are taken out for exercise
 twice a day for periods of about one  
 hour. Cats can also be boarded at the 
 kennels. A current vaccination        
 certificate is needed before animals  
 are accepted for boarding. Animals are
 boarded at the kennels for various    
 reasons: owners may be on holiday,    
 ill, or may have gone to live abroad  
 for a longer period of time.
