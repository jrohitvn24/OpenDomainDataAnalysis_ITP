 patients of all ages.The majority of  
 patients are old people.{WESTON       
{HOSPITAL}looks after people who are   
 mentally handicapped.There are{150    
 staff of which there are{100}nurses   
 and{50}others.If the patients have    
 nobody else to look after them they   
 will stay there for their whole life. 
 At{WESTON HOSPITAL}they train them to 
 do things they need to do.Soon the    
 hospital is hoping to lose some       
 beds because the people will be       
 going to other places within the local
 community.                            
   The{HOSPITAL}is financed by{CENTRAL 
{GOVERNMENT}funds of over{Â£1,000,000}a 
 year.If money were no object the      
 hospital would like to modernise the  
 buildings.
