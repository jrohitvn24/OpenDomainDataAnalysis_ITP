 A survey into the leisure activities  
 revealed that the most popular are    
 gardening,swimming,reading and        
 watching television.Although there is 
 an interest in a variety of outdoor   
 activities there is not widespread    
 support for them.The survey showed    
 that the most popular team            
 participation sports were football and
 rounders.However the two local leisure
 centres,Bolton and Horwich were hardly
 ever used by people on the estate.    
 Most hobby activities were those that 
 could  be done in the home.           
 The children seemed to have few       
 personal hobbies but some attend a    
 club organised by a youth group.The   
 local Studio 3 cinema, and the Octagon
 theatre were rarely visited.
