At Grizedale we have the largest forest in the Lake District, maintained by the Forestry Commission.&lt;br />&lt;br />Soft timber has little value commercially and an accelerated programme of felling is being undertaken to remove swathes of pine forest. Some of these cleared areas are being allowed to regenerate naturally while others are remaining as open fell. Only a few small areas are again being planted with conifers; instead, mixed native woodland is being created, especially on the lower slopes of the valleys. This is to improve the appearance and habitat value of the forest.&lt;br />&lt;br />Only a handful of staff is employed in the timber felling part of the business, and they use large harvesting machinery rather than chain saws. Contractors are brought in to do most of the tree thinning work in existing plantations, and to take the timber away in large haulage vehicles.   &lt;br />
