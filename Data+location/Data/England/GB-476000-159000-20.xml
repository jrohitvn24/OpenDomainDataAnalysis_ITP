		<title>20Lindum Nurseries, Eversley</title>
		<content>    {Lindum Nurseries}was built in     
 1928.  Lindum is the Latin name for   
 Lincoln, where the original owners    
 came from. The present owners, the{   
{Barker family,}have been running the  
 business since 1946. They have three  
 and a half acres of land, including   
 fourteen greenhouses. They grow       
 tomatoes, bedding and pot plants. They
 employ up to eight people, depending  
 on the time of year and how busy they 
 are. They produce between seventy-five
 and a hundred tons of tomatoes in a   
 season and twenty thousand boxes of   
 plants (about half a million plants). 
 The nurseries are situated on the     
 A327 the main road to Reading, so     
 they attract passing trade. Mr. Barker
 told us that they also need to        
 advertise to maintain trading levels. 
 Their main problems are greenfly,     
 slugs, fungus and the weather.        </content>
