		<title>07SOUTHERN APPROACH S. REIGATE</title>
		<content>     From the south one approaches the 
 block along the busy A217,linking Gat-
 wick and Heathrow Airports via Sidlow 
 where the road crosses the River Mole 
 by a stone bridge.This low-lying area 
 is liable to flood in wet weather.To  
 either side of the main road is open  
 pasture land ,hedges,copses and large 
 oak trees.The chalk escarpment of the 
 North Downs can be seen beyond Reigate
 northwards.                           
     A mile beyond Sidlow Bridge are   
 the Reigate Grammar School playing    
 fields dominated by Rugby goal posts  
 opposite the Doversgreen Home for the 
 Elderly.Here the open country side    
 gives way to housing estates criss-   
 crossed by service roads.A little fur-
 ther on is a large cross-roads along- 
 side the Angel Public House,and Wood- 
 hatch shopping area.
