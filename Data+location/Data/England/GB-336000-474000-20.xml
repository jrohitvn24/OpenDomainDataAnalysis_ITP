		<title>20Cartmel Peninsula</title>
		<content>   The area where you will find the    
 villages of Allithwaite and Flookburgh
 is known as the Cartmel Peninsula.    
   It is a very interesting area,full  
 of history and places to visit.There  
 are lots of old villages and the      
 scenery is beautiful.It is pastoral   
 and gentle, in sharp contrast to the  
 rugged areas of the Lake District.    
   The area is well worth a visit and  
 we all hope you will do your own      
 exploration.                          
                                       
  The staff and children of Flookburgh 
 and Allithwaite C.E. Primary Schools  
 wish to thank everyone who helped in  
 this contribution.
