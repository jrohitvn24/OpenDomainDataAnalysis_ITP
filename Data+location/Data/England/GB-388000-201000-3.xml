		<content>                                       
                                       
 We usually have three meals a         
 day,breakfast,dinner and tea.For      
 breakfast I have toast,marmalade,a    
 drink of orange juice and sometimes a 
 yoghurt.I have my mid-day meal at     
 school.We eat off plates and use      
 knives and forks.At school we have a  
 variety of different foods.Today we   
 had chipped potatoes and baked beans  
 in tomato sauce and sausages.We have  
 water to drink,out of beakers.We had  
 chocolate ice-cream or crackers and   
 cheese and a glass of milk for        
 sweet.Some children take sandwiches   
 for school dinner and some go home.   
 For tea I have cauliflower cheese and 
 potato.I drink tea with my main       
 meal.For pudding I have apple crumble.
 Most people also eat bread and butter 
 or margarine.                         </content>
