		<title>06A local pig farm</title>
		<content> There is a{pig farm}in the Chilcompton
 area. It has twenty one boars and four
 hundred and fify sows. The farmer     
 said, sows normally gave two or three 
 litters a year. This produces         
 approximately ten thousand pigs. They 
 have three{different breeds}at the    
 farm, the Land Race, the Welsh and the
 Large White.We saw newly born piglets 
 drinking their mother's milk.The      
 farmer told us that after four or five
 days they eat proper food, which is   
 small pellets made from cereal and    
 other dried food.The farmer said, that
 each morning the piglets were checked 
 to see that they were alright.He also 
 told us meningitis and pneumonia were 
{common diseases}among pigs.When a pig 
 is twenty five weeks old it is sold to
 a farm in Devon for Â£75.00 to be      
 fattened up for the market.
