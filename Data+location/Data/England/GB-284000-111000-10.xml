		<title>10HOME LIFE IN CRUWYS MORCHARD</title>
		<content> The weekly routine of farming and     
 business families differs in one      
 respect. The former choose working    
 hours and meal-times to fit in with   
 the daily tasks. The latter have a    
 rigid pattern of fixed hours, light   
 lunches and evening meals. Children   
 are away at school all day.           
 In 1962 electricity arrived, with it  
 better lighting and many appliances.  
 Farmhouses have Rayburn-type cookers  
 run on solid fuel, oil, liquid gas or 
 wood, providing hot water. All other  
 homes have electric or liquid gas     
 cookers. There are no local stores.   
 Fridges and deep-freezers ensure      
 variety and availability of perishable
 food. Pasties alternate with pizzas,  
 curries vie with casseroles. Many     
 homes now have central-heating, 99%   
 have television. Telephones are needed
 as there is only one public box.      </content>
