		<title>12BOXTED HALL FARM</title>
		<content> Boxted Hall Farm covers some 700      
 acres,100 acres of which are woodland,
 which includes Boxted Great Wood and  
 Boxted Little Wood.Boxted Great Wood  
 was mentioned in the Domesday book and
 still shows signs of medieval         
 planting.                             
   The oldest barn was built in the    
 14th century,another in the 16th      
 century and the others in the 17th    
 century,all are in a good state of    
 preservation.In order to keep these   
 buildings well cared for the owners of
 the farm feel they must put them to   
 some good use,craftwork or light      
 industry,as they are no longer needed 
 for storage.                          
  The farm is now completely arable    
 except for 30 acres under grass which 
 is let to Mr.Thorpe the butcher for   
 his cattle.In 1976 the water meadows  
 near the R.Stour were ploughed up.    </content>
