The Library is one of our main sources 
of information in the Lowestoft        
Community. On the first floor there is 
a Lecture Theatre, cafe and a Reference
Section. On the ground floor is the    
Chidren's library and an Adults'       
fiction section. The library is all    
computerised, and has a lift going up  
to the first floor. Usually, in the    
children's part they display many      
pieces of Art Work from schools        
around the area. In the Adults'        
section you can hire videos, as well   
as books. More recently, a computer    
software lending  service has been set 
up. The library also owns a Mobile     
Library which goes around to schools   
supplying  them  with books in order   
to keep school resourses up to date and
interesting for the pupils.
