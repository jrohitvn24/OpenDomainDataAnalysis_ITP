		<title>15Worksop Bypass</title>
		<content>     Construction first began on the   
 bypass in the back end of 1984. To not
 disrupt traffic flow it must pass     
 under Sparken Hill (the present B6005)
 in a  very  deep  cutting. For  the   
 construction  of  this  large  earth  
 movers have been required.            
     Where it crosses the Netherton    
 Road a it was thought better to link  
 it with existing roads by a           
 roundabout. The road to the S of the  
 roundabout is to be improved. Traffic 
 from the S will be diverted from      
 Sparken Hill and Netherton Road (the  
 new B6005)  to  the  bypass. Noise    
 barriers will be erected between the  
 roundabout and the school and along   
 both  sides  of  the  bypass  through 
 Manton and Windmill lane residential  
 estates. A  footbridge  will also be  
 built to join Manton with  Windmill   
 Lane.                                 </content>
