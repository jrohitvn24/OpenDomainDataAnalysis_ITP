		<title>17Mousehole Harbour Lights</title>
		<content>     At{Christmas}1984,{Simon Groom}of 
 the{BBC Blue Peter}programme, came to 
{Mousehole}to perform the ceremony of  
 switching on the harbour lights on its
 twenty-first anniversary.{            
     It all started when a number of   
 local men decided to brighten up      
{Christmas}by putting up a string of   
 lights around the harbour front.  The 
 money to purchase the lights was      
 collected from the local people and   
 over the years the number of displays 
 has increased and they have become    
 larger. If you visit Mousehole at     
 Christmas time, entering the village  
 from the{Penzance}or eastern end of   
 the village, you will see six large   
 set-pieces lit up around the hills at 
 the back of the village.  In the      
 village itself there are strings of   
 lights along both the quays and all   
 around the houses.                    </content>
