		<content> Hall Farm and Croft Farm were both    
 much larger in the past. Hall Farm has
 sold about 700 of its original 1200   
 acres, mainly in the last two         
 generations.An enormous decrepit barn 
 was being pulled down to make way for 
 housing.                              
 Both farms only employ one worker     
 each and have been owned by the same  
 family for several generations.       
 Both farms grow wheat and barley as   
 their main crops, with peas also      
 important. In addition Croft Farm     
 (165 acres) grows much mustard;Hall   
 Farm, sugarbeet and interestingly     
 ticbeans specially grown for          
 pigeon-feed.An average field is 15-20 
 acres. A typical farmer's day starts  
 at 8a.m. and goes on till 8.30 p.m.   
 but he has Dec-Feb off. It takes a    
 month for  the harvest. Spring barley 
 is the least reliable crop.           </content>
