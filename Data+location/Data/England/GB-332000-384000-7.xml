		<title>07        COMPUTERS</title>
		<content> I did a survey of{computers}in my own 
 class  asking which children have     
 computers and which children do not.  
 If they had not got one they had to   
 choose, from a list,one which they had
 used and liked the most.  The{ZX      
{Spectrum}was the easy winner, second  
 came the{Apple Macintosh}and joint    
 third came the{BBC B, Acorn Electron  
 and a{Spectrum +.}In 1985 our school  
 had three{micro computers;}a BBC B, an
 Acorn Electron and a ZX-81 with a{16k 
{R.A.M. (Random Access Memory). }We    
 have a selection of{Software}for all  
 of our micros.  I share a micro with  
 my sister, our micro is a{16k ZX      
{Spectrum,}we have a selection of      
 software and I use the manual to write
{programs}and to find things out about 
 the computer.  My favourite computer  
 game is{Space Invaders. }There are no 
 computer shops in Port Sunlight.      </content>
