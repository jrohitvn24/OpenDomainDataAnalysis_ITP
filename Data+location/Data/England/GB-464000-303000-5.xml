		<title>05FARMING SCRAPTOFT THURNBY</title>
		<content> The valley is farmed by four farmers  
 and there is also a Nursery Garden and
 a Rose Garden in the district.The four
 farms which we visited are quite      
 different and provide an interesting  
 contrast.Redvers Farm in the east is  
 mainly a sheep farm.New Ingarsby Farm 
 is owned by a local dairy and         
 concentrates entirely on milk         
 production.Scraptoft Hill Farm        
 produces seed corn but does have      
 sheep and cattle for beef production. 
 Keyham High Leas is a mixed farm run  
 by a traditional farmer.A local       
 builder also farms land near the      
 estates.Planning permission has now   
 been given for building and work has  
 now begun.This has been opposed by    
 existing residents who will lose      
 their country views.Locals also object
 to hedges being removed, and medieval 
 strip farmland being ploughed over.   </content>
