		<title>14CHANGING FACE OF WOODINGDEAN</title>
		<content> The Downs Hotel in Warren Road was    
 built in 1927 as a public house.There 
 were no shops in those days,only      
 Ghazals,which was a small hut.People  
 had to walk into Brighton to get      
 clothes and basic items.Inthose days  
 you had to walk 50ft. to go to the    
 toilet.At night a big cart came around
 the houses and collected the sewage   
 emptying it into a field.To get milk  
 you had to take a can to West         
 Farm.Underneath Fitzherbert School    
 there is a very deep well which has   
 been filled in.At the top of Batemans 
 Road there were two Iron age          
 skeletons.Woodingdean has changed a   
 lot since those early days.Open fields
 have given way to factories and       
 houses.More people have moved into the
 area but still it retains a certain   
 remoteness from the rest of Brighton.
