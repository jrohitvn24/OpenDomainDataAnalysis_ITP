		<title>12HERRINGTHORPE WOODS ROTH'HAM</title>
		<content> My friend and I are keen bird         
 watchers,My garden has a gate that    
 leads into the Herringthorpe woods and
 into Gibbings Greave woods.There are  
 lots of wood pigeons or ring necked   
 doves and there are a variety of      
 magpies. Also there a lot of starlings
 and a lot of sparrows,there are a lot 
 of blue tits which collect the hair   
 when we groom our dog to build their  
 nest.In winter there are many robins  
 in the woods.In the summer            
 Herringthorpe woods are very          
 beautiful and in the Autumn we go     
 chesnut collecting.There used to be   
 squirrels in the wood,but not any more
