		<title>15What's on in Thurlow</title>
		<content> Gardening is extremely popular pastime
 with men working on vegetable         
 allotments long into the summer       
 evenings. Thurlow and Carlton Green's 
 gardens are a tribute to their owners'
 hard work, neat and tidy in the winter
 and cascading with colour in the      
 summer. The village hall is used for  
 wedding receptions on many Saturdays. 
 Open disco evenings were tried but    
 were given up because of disruption   
 from outsiders, so now most village   
 hall functions are organised by the   
 various clubs. There is a strong      
 reserve of talent here for organising 
 annual events;the Thurlow Steam Rally 
 attracting those beautiful engines of 
 iron adn steam from a wide area. There
 is a September Fair and mini-fetes,   
 concerts and bazaars.
