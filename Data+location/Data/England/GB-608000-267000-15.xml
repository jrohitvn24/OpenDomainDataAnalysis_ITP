   The chidren at Stoke Ash School play
many games in the playground including 
football, tennis, forty-forty, British 
bulldog, and stuck in the mud.         
          RULES                        
FORTY-FORTY This is a hide and seek    
game. Everybody hides while the catcher
counts to forty. When he spots somebody
he shouts "Forty-forty I see ...." If  
you are caught you stand by a tree, you
can go and hide again if somebody who  
has not been caught can sneak up and   
say "Forty-forty saved you."           
STUCK IN THE MUD Two children are it.  
If one of them touches you you have to 
stand with your arm touching the wall  
until somebody who is free runs under  
your arm, then you are free again.     
BRITISH BULLDOG Run over the playground
without getting caught. The catcher has
to pick you up and say "Bulldog 123"   </content>
