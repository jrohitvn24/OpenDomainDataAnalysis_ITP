		<title>14Burringham River Bank.</title>
		<content> The river has long bends in it and    
 there are smooth patches where there  
 were small whirlpools. It is a murky, 
 grey/black river with some oil on the 
 surface. The banks were muddy and wet 
 because the water had been in and now 
 it was going out. The Trent flows into
 the Humber Estuary and then into the  
 North Sea. Sometimes the river nearly 
 floods the village and almost comes   
 over the top of the 2m. high bank that
 has been added to the river bank to   
 stop flooding. We saw an empty barge  
 going up the river, perhaps it was    
 going to Gainsborough. On the bank    
 were the remains of the stone railway 
 bridge which used to cross the Trent  
 here. Rusty old iron railway tracks   
 poked out from the bank and we could  
 follow the embankment back down the   
 side of the school to where it joins  
 the new railway line from Scunthorpe. </content>
