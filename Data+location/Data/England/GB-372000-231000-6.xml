		<title>06REDMARLEYWOMANS FELLOWSHIP</title>
		<content> In 1950 a group called Young Wives was
 formed but no one manted to leave     
 Young Wives to go onto Mothers        
 Union.So in 1965 they changed the name
 to Womans Fellowship.To start with    
 the monthly meeting was held in homes 
 but it grew so they moved it into the 
 village hall.Each meeting is opened   
 with a prayer and hymn followed by a  
 speaker who would talk about many     
 subjects like lapidary,cooking and egg
 painting.They keep connections with   
 the church by helping at the Christmas
 Fete.If anyone is ill a member of     
 Womans Fellowship will go and help to 
 the best oftheir ability.Every        
 November they have a party and in     
 December they go carol singing.Until  
 lately all the money raised would go  
 to the Eastnor Childrens Home.Now the 
 money goes to lots of different       
 charities.                            </content>
