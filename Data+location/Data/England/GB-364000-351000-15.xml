		<title>15Nantwich Christian Council</title>
		<content>    Ecumenism is fostered in Nantwich  
 by the{Nantwich Christian Council.    
 Ministers from the{Anglican, Catholic,
{Methodist,and United Reformed Churches
 hold monthly "Fraternal Meetings", and
 attend Council meetings with three    
 delegates.Their aim is to promote     
 joint Christian liturgy through       
 ecumenical services in each others    
 churches and inter-denominational     
 preaching plus joint outdoor services.
 Of note are those in{Holy Week,}a     
{Bible Sunday}and during{Christian Aid 
{Week.}Social initiatives have emerged 
 such as the unemployed, who have a    
 "drop-in" facility to meet and talk; a
 "listening-post" for those with       
 problems of loneliness;pastoral work  
 and visiting for those who need care  
 and help, and a marriage guidance     
 group.It can therefore be seen that   
 the Council is important in Nantwich. </content>
