		<title>12CATTLE FARMING.</title>
		<content> A typical cattle farm is 160 acres    
 which would support 110 milking cows, 
 70 beef cattle, a bull, 20 calves &amp; 75
 heifers.Two favourite breeds are      
 Fresian &amp; Fresian/Hereford            
 Cross.Calves are born at any time of  
 year &amp; in an average year there might 
 be 110.Barren cows are sold at        
 Bakewell Market &amp; beef to Whalley &amp;   
 Thorpe Butchers.Barley,silage,cake    
 compound,molasses,fish meal,sugar     
 beet,milk powder &amp; calf pellets       
 supplement the natural food.E.E.C.    
 regulations have had a bad effect on  
 cattle farming by stopping expansion. 
 The average cost of running a farm    
 like this is about Â£52,000 per annum.
