		<title>05The Butcher (1 of 2 pages)</title>
		<content> We interviewed a butcher,             
{DO MOST PEOPLE SHOP LOCALLY?} I'm     
 quite lucky, people have shopped with 
 me for years and they are regular     
 customers.Some people now go into     
 Norwich or Wroxham but I do well      
 enough.                               
{WHAT DO YOU THINK OF CITY SHOPS? }    
 Butchering is butchering. We buy in   
 some meat and we kill some of our own.
 We provide the same service as city   
 butchers, it's only the big shops like
 Tesco and Sainsbury's that do us      
 damage because they can buy in bulk   
 and sell cheaper. But if you want     
 friendly service or just a wee bit of 
 meat we're the ones to see.           
{WHAT DO YOU THINK OF TOURISTS? }They  
 don't bother us apart from sometimes  
 in the middle of summer. Otherwise    
 they stay up the other end of the     
 town. (interview continued)           </content>
