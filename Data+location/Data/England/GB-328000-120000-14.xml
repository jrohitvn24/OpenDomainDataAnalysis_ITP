		<title>14SENIOR CITIZENS</title>
		<content>   Senior Citizens meet on the first   
 Thursday of every month at Hatch      
 Beauchamp village hall. They play     
 Bingo and listen to talks or watch    
 slides shown by a guest. Twice monthly
 outings are organised,perhaps to the  
 seaside or to an historical house. On 
 these outings members buy lunches and 
 cream teas and often end the day with 
 fish and chips.                       
   At their July meeting, the Senior   
 Citizens visit the village school and 
 are entertained by the children. The  
 school children perform a play and    
 sing and play musical instruments. To 
 conclude a pleasant afternoon the     
 older children give their guests tea, 
 which is provided by the parents of   
 the children. As a sign of their      
 appreciation the Senior Citizens give 
 each child an ice lolly and everybody 
 has a good time.                      </content>
