		<title>04THE RECREATION GROUND</title>
		<content>    The Recreation Ground in the centre
 of Summercourt ,by the chapel and     
 opposite the fair ground was given    
 many years ago to the village by Mrs  
 Thomas ,who owned the land.           
    It is known locally as the"Rec"    
 and is about 1 hectare in size,and is 
 a well mown grass field.              
    There are four swings ,a           
 roundabout,a slide and it used to have
 three see-saws,but now only one works 
 as the others are broken.At one end of
 the field is a football pitch with    
 goal posts used for kick arounds by   
 small groups.                         
    The school at one time used the    
 Recreation Field for their sports but 
 now have a field of their own.        
    Some shrubs and decorative trees   
 have been planted round the field edge
 but have not yet fully developed.
