		<title>17Law and Order in Verwood.</title>
		<content> We have one{community policeman}who   
 patrols the area on a{pedal cycle}or  
{motor cycle,}so that he is easily     
 available to the villagers. Verwood is
 also patrolled by shifts of 20        
 policemen using four{'panda cars',}   
 giving us a 24 hour cover. They are   
 here to protect us and our property   
 and they carry a{truncheon}and not a  
 gun. The{control room}is in           
 Bournemouth, so, if we need a         
{detective}or a{police dog,}one can be 
 sent out quickly. Some problems today 
 are cars parked badly at road         
 junctions, graffiti on buildings,     
 vandalism and children who try        
 shoplifting. The nearest{magistrates' 
{Court}is in Wimborne and{Crown Courts 
 in Bournemouth and Dorchester. Four   
{Special}policemen and women who live  
 in Verwood assist the Police Force    
 when needed.                          </content>
