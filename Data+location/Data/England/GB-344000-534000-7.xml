   It is estimated that there are 6    
 badger setts, and 20 fox earths, as   
 well as considerable numbers of       
 smaller animals, such as hares and    
 rabbits.                              
   Of particular interest are red      
 squirrels (no grey), and a number of  
 colonies of bats.                     
   A recent, unwelcome, immigrant is   
 the mink.                             
                                       
{BIRDS}                                
   Because of the wide variety of      
 habitats, there is considerable       
 diversity of bird species, although   
 Red Shank and Barn Owls have          
 disappeared from New Rent Area.       
   Recently buzzards have been showing 
 an increase, while there has been a   
 decline in stream residing birds,     
 because of pollution.                 </content>
