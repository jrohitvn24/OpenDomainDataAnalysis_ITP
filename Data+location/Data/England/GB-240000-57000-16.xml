		<title>16RECREATION_LEISURE ACTIVITY</title>
		<content>     OUR SURVEY WAS OF THE{LEISURE     
{ACTIVITIES}ENJOYED BY 42 FAMILIES.THEY
 WERE GIVEN A CHOICE OF 11 ACTIVITIES  
 AND SAID WHICH THEY PREFERRED.        
     WE FOUND THAT MEN PARTICIPATED IN 
 MORE ACTIVITIES,WITH THREE EXCEPTIONS,
 GARDENING,BINGO AND THEATRE.THE MEN'S 
 FAVOURITE ACTIVITY WAS D.I.Y,WITH A   
 MAXIMUM VOTE OF 42.THE LADIES         
 FAVOURITE ACTIVITY WAS GARDENING WITH 
 A VOTE OF 39.                         
     COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT THE ADULTS    
 THEMSELVES GOT OUT OF THESE ACTIVITIES
 WERE SIMILAR.IT SEEMS THAT READING,   
 GARDENING AND T.V.ALL RELAX YOU WELL, 
 WHILST PARTICIPATION SPORTS PROVIDE   
 ENJOYMENT AND NEW FRIENDS.WE DECIDED  
 THAT THE REASON WOMEN DON'T TAKE PART 
 IN MORE SPORT IS PROBABLY BECAUSE     
 THEY'RE NOT AS COMPETITIVE AS MEN.
