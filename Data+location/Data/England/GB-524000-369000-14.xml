		<title>14CLUBS AND ENTERTAINMENT</title>
		<content>  Horncastle has over 100 different    
 clubs which cater for all ages and for
 many different activities. Some, like 
 the Theatre Club, Silver Bands and    
 Dancing School provide regular        
 entertainment for the town which no   
 longer has a theatre or cinema. Two   
 examples are as follows:              
  The Pigeon Fanciers' Club. This meets
 on Fridays and Saturdays in a shed    
 near the Crown Inn. There are fifteen 
 members who race and breed pigeons. We
 spoke to one person who owns 40       
 pigeons but some members have many    
 more.                                 
  The Julie Deane School of Dancing.   
 Founded in 1975, the school now has   
 over 100 members between the ages of 4
 and 23. Pupils wear blue or black     
 leotards and tights.All types of dance
 are taught and many examinations      
 taken.                                </content>
