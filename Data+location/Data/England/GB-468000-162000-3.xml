    The woodland in the area we covered
 was populated with many animals of    
 different kinds. Priory copse was the 
 most densley populated area for       
 animals. It had many birds of         
 different species, the most common    
 being rooks, crows and blackbirds. I  
 also saw the remains of an egg from a 
 large bird. To go with the birds there
 were many butterflies. One that I saw 
 was a Meadow-Brown butterfly.         
   In the middle of the copse I found  
 deer tracks and deer feeders. There is
 also an area in the copse purely for  
 pheasant raising. There are also some 
 rabbit warrens. All the copse is      
 covered with trees of different kinds 
 such as the Beech, Fir, Oak, and      
 Pine
