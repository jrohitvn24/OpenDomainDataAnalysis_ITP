		<content>{     A history of the Church provided 
{by Matthew Andrews, aged 9, son of the
{present Vicar.     }                  
      The Saxon King Edward was a      
 Christian so when he visited          
 "Willetun" he decided that he needed a
 place of worship and built a small    
{wooden chapel. } It is quite likely   
 that King Edward's chapel stood on the
 same spot as our present St.Peter's.  
{Reginald Fitz-Urse in 1170}along with 
 some of his fellow knights murdered   
{Thomas Becket.  }As Reginald owned a  
 lot of Williton some of it went to    
 Robert, his brother, who gave most of 
 it to{Watchet Church}and{Williton}then
 became like a daughter church to      
{Watchet.  }Robert rebuilt{St. Peter's}
{Church.  }Below the East wall of the  
 present church there may still be the 
 remains of Robert's chapel.
