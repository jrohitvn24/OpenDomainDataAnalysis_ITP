		<title>06Schoolboy's Day -Thorpe</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.30am. I have a wash and 
 when I get dressed I often wear a     
 tracksuit. Then I have my breakfast of
 Rice Crispies with milk on while I    
 watch TVam. At 8.30am. I catch the bus
 to school at Todwick because the      
 school in Thorpe closed in 1981.I     
 arrive at 8.50am. and leave again at  
 3.25pm. We have  dinner at 12.00 noon 
 and afternoon lessons begin at        
 1.00pm. When I get home I watch TV,   
 then I go out and play climbing trees 
 or I climb on to the garage roof. When
 friends come I do the same but with   
 them. I go back in at about 7.00pm.   
 to watch TV. I might watch the news,  
 or a serial like Airwolf and some     
 other things till 9.00pm. I go to bed 
 and read mainly nature books for about
 2 hours then go to sleep.
