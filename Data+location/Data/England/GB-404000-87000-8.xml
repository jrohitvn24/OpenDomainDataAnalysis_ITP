		<title>08The Ferry</title>
		<content>    We interviewed a man called Mr     
 Gosney who was the manager of the     
 chain ferry in Poole Harbour.         
    He has been working on the ferry   
 for about ten years. He has lived in  
 Bournemouth for six years. Mr Gosney  
 has had a couple of accidents on the  
 ferry, the most serious was in October
 1984 when the chains snapped and a tug
 boat pushed it back onto the slipway  
 where it was repaired. Fortunately no 
 one has been injured in an accident   
 yet. Yachts are always hitting the    
 side of the ferry because of the      
 strong currents and winds. Its weight 
 without cars is fifty two tonnes. The 
 chains are about three tonnes.        
    Before the ferry, local fishermen  
 used to row people over to Shellbay.  
 There has probably been a ferry since 
 Henry the Eighth's time. In the winter
 the winter the water floods the Ferry.</content>
