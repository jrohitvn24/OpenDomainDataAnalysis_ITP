		<title>06FARMING IN UNSWORTH.</title>
		<content> Back o'th Moss is the nearest farm to 
 our school. The farm used to own 300  
 acres of land, until 500 houses, 2    
 schools, an old peoples home and a    
 motorway, which runs right through the
 farm, were built. They now only own   
 150 acres, half of the amount they    
 originally owned. Due to the lack of  
 land they could not keep their dairy  
 cows. On the farm they now own pigs,  
 horses, goats, hens and chickens. They
 either breed their own animals or go  
 to auction to buy them.               
 The farm grows hay, corn, barley and  
 potatoes, but on much of the farm the 
 soil cover is too thin for crops so   
 the farmer grazes his cattle. The name
 of the farm comes from being at the   
 back of the moss.
