    Stafford Rangers was founded in    
1879 and their ground is at Marston    
Road, Stafford.                        
                                       
   All the present players are on free 
transfer, but their most expensive     
player was Trevor Dance who cost the   
club #10,000.   There are only sixteen 
players and no junior team.            
                                       
    They train on Tuesday and Thursday 
evenings.  The team plays an annual    
friendly match against Liverpool.  They
have played abroad in Italy.           
                                       
    The police are brought in in case  
of crowd trouble and the stand is made 
of concrete and steel with plastic     
seats so that there is little danger of
fire.                                  </content>
