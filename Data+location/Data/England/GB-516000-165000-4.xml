		<content> We used to be able to cross the A3    
 like you can cross any residential    
 road today. There were alot of fields 
 about and there was a cinema called   
 the Tolworth Odeon which was          
 surrounded by allotments. I would like
 to see all of the open space areas    
 kept like that and no development on  
 them.The few fields that we have left 
 i would like to keep.{
