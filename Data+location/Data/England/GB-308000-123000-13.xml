		<title>13HIGHER POLES HILL</title>
		<content> Higher Poles Hill is a small holding  
 that is two acres in size.On the farm 
 they mainly grow potatoes.The hardest 
 time of the year is during the harvest
 when they have to collect the potatoes
 and silage grass.There are some more  
 farmers near by and they have many    
 animals such as goats,pigs cows,cats  
 and dogs.The farmers wife helps milk  
 the goats and looks after the the     
 chickens.His daughter mucks out the   
 pigs and feeds them.On the farm they  
 don't sell any produce they keep it   
 for themselves.There was a stream but 
 it was dammed.Before they moved in    
 there was a family living there who   
 used the land for chickens and        
 grazing.For transport they have to use
 cars.All the family who live on the   
 small holding like living there.
