		<title>14Mr T**** (continued)</title>
		<content> He is quite scornful of{"this jogging 
{rubbish"}implying that it's just a    
 fleeting fashion,that won't bring real
 benefit to its practicioners.He is    
 also amused by people who move into   
 older houses and then procede to rip  
 them apart and "do them up",he is     
 horrified by local house prices.He is 
 pleased that his local church,the     
 Methodist chapel is still doing well, 
 with a number of young people         
 attending.                            
 Like many other local people he is    
 slightly worried by the influx of     
 immigrants, the local Mini-market has 
 just been taken over by an Asian      
 family.But it's not their colour that 
 worries him.As he says,there was a big
 influx of Polish refugees after the   
 war, and they have integrated well.   
 No,for Mr T**** it's getting used to  
 the new faces that he finds difficult.</content>
