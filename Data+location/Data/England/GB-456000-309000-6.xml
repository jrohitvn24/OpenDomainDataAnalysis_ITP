		<content> Three publications serve Birstall:    
{'Bugle'}(Birstall Community College   
 Magazine),{'Contact'}(Magazine of news
 and events from churches, community   
 and college) and{'Birstall Post'.     
    The{Birstall Post}is a free,       
 monthly paper produced by the{Birstall
{Action Team}who are supported by the  
{Manpower Services Commission.         
    They receive most of their         
 information from people contacting    
 their office or by attending Parish   
 Council Meetings. They came to        
 interview us about the{Domesday       
{Project}and we visited the office.    
    When information comes in, they    
 first check it for spelling. Then the 
 typist types out 31 characters per    
 line and gives it to the Editor. Next 
 they have to think of a short and     
 interesting headline. Pictures are    
 made into dots before they are used.  </content>
