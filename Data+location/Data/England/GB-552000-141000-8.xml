		<content>  Northfield Public House in Speldhurst
 was built in 1861. The oldest houses  
 in Speldhurst are in Bullingston Lane.
  The oven in the Bakers is over a     
 hundred years old, it is now worked by
 oil. There is an original Hovis clock 
 on the wall in the shop. They have got
 a roll maker in the kitchen which is  
 quite old. They use nice old pills to 
 get the bread out of the oven. The    
 grocers shop is quite new, it was     
 originally a butchers shop. The George
 and Dragon Pub was built in 13th      
 century. The church,{Saint Mary the   
{Virgin,}is as old. The  Choir vestry  
 was built in 1897 as a memorial of the
 Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The
 Priests vestry was added in 1923.     
 Speldhurst School is 126 years old and
 some of it's bricks are made of       
 sandstone.
