		<content>Mrs Lamb has lived in the village for  
over 60 years. In that time she has    
seen many changes in the village and in
the family business, Lamb's Garage. She
thinks that the work in the garage has 
increased enormously with the greater  
number of vehicles but this has been   
offset by the acquisition of automatic 
petrol pumps, a hydraulic ramp and the 
readily interchangable parts for       
vehicles.                              
In the village, Mrs Lamb has seen the  
introduction of electricity into the   
village and she will soon see the      
advent of gas for the first time. She  
has seen the building of two new       
schools (she is a Governor of the      
Primary School), the building of the   
Village Institute and the development  
of much new housing in the village. She
feels that Hornby has retained much of 
its old community spirit.              </content>
