		<title>18A DAY IN MY BROTHER'S LIFE</title>
		<content>  I woke up and went into my brother's 
 room. He's disabled but still gave me 
 a smile.While I was getting dressed   
 Mum fed James.He had Ready Brek.Mum   
 mixed his Tegretol.He needs this      
 because he might have a fit.Mum       
 dressed James.She put on his shoes and
 coat.While Mum put her shoes on I held
 James. We started the journey to      
 school.When we got there James started
 to cry because he knew it would be a  
 long time before he would see us      
 again after school.Mum went home to   
 start patterning. Patterning is to    
 stimulate James' brain and these      
 exercises get his arms and legs       
 moving.The most important exercise is 
 the cross pattern.{Ninety people}help 
 and they all come from Wythall.We have
 been patterning since James was one.  
 Now he is five. {By MEADOW GREEN.
