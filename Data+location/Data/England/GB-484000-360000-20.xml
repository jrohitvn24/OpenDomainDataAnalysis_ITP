		<title>20FOOTPATHS IN SWINDERBY AREA.</title>
		<content>  {Footpaths}across the fields  joining
 the farms and  the  village  must have
 played  a  very important part in  the
 lives  of the  residents  in  previous
 generations, but  during the last  few
 years  they  have  been  neglected  or
 ploughed  over  by  the  farmers.  The
 County Councils have now erected field
 path signs showing routes of paths and
 bridleways.                           
   The  A46  which  passes  through the
 area is  the {Roman}Foss  Way  between
 Bath  and   Lincoln.   The  Romanstone
 plantation  near Potter  Hill is named
 after the Roman Mile or Boundary Stone
 that was found there, this is now kept
 in Newark Millgate  Museum. There is a
 site  of  a  Roman Villa on Folly Lane
 and pottery has been found nearby.    
   This  project  has  been compiled by
 the{2nd Swinderby Guides}with the help
 of their parents and friends.         </content>
