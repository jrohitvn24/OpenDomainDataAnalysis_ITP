		<title>12A TYPICAL DAY</title>
		<content> In the morning when I arrive at school
 I play with my friends until the bell 
 goes. My lessons start at 9.00 a.m. I 
 have different lessons every day. I   
 finish school at 3.35 p.m. when I     
 arrive home I change my clothes and do
 my homework. Then I have my tea. After
 my tea I play with my friends and then
 watch television.{Martin Youngman (12)
                                       
 I get up in the morning, get washed,  
 get dressed and have my breakfast. I  
 go to school and after six lessons i  
 have a lunch break. After that we have
 another four lessons then we go home. 
 When I get home I do my homework, have
 my dinner and then go out to play or  
 watch television. I have some supper  
 then go to bed.{Katherine Balmer (12)
