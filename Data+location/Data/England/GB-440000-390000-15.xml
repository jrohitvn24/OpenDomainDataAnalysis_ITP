		<title>15THE RIVER DON</title>
		<content> The four square kilometers that we    
 surveyed are on two hills with the Don
 valley in between. The river Don runs 
 through the bottom of the valley. The 
 valley goes from north to south, with 
 the town of Rotherham to the north and
 the city of Sheffield to the south. On
 the hills to the west of the River Don
 is Masborough and Kimberworth. To the 
 east of the river we have the village 
 of Canklow and on the highest point of
 the hills behind Canklow is Bolton    
 Castle. On the flat land alongside the
 River Don there is a railweay and a   
 canal. This is where all the large    
 steel works like Templeborough were   
 built to take advantage of the canal. 
 The River Rother runs along the valley
 in front of Canklow to join the River 
 Don in the centre of Rotherham.
