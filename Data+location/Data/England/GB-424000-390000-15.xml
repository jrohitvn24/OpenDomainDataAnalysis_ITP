		<title>15COUNTRY LEISURE ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content> Country people on the whole have the  
 same sort of leisure activities as    
 town people,but some of them are quite
 different &amp; unusual.                  
 GROUSE BEATING:The function of the the
 grouse beater is to flush out the     
 birds on the moor for the men with    
 guns to shoot them.They space         
 themselves out across the moor &amp; at a 
 given signal begin to walk in line    
 waving white flags &amp; making as much   
 noise as possible.When the birds begin
 to fly they try to direct them towards
 the guns.                             
 HANDBELL RINGING:This is a popular    
 activity &amp; a group meets every week to
 practise.They play hymns,carols,folk &amp;
 popular classics at the annual Garden 
 Party,in the Shopping Precinct at     
 Christmas &amp; around the local pubs to  
 raise money.
