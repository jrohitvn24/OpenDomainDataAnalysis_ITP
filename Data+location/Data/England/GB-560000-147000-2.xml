		<content>   I get up at 8.00,have my            
 breakfast and go to the bathroom and  
 brush my teeth.When I am dressed I    
 brush my hair and my mum takes me to  
 school in the car.I go to the         
 playground and play ball until the    
 whistle goes.We line up and lead into 
 class.When we are inside I take off my
 shoes and lead into assembly where we 
 hear a story and sing a hymn.After    
 assembly we go to class and do maths  
 until break time.At break I eat my    
 crisps.We then do some English.At     
 11.30 we go swimming until dinner     
 time.We have a small break,have our   
 dinner and then play until the whistle
 goes.We do Topic until break time and 
 then have singing.School ends at 3.45.
 I then go to the school swimming club.
 I go home and have my tea.Then I go   
 out to play and when I have to go to  
 bed I have a wash and brush my teeth. </content>
