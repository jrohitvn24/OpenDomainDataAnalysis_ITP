		<content>THE SAXON CHURCH REFERRED TO IN        
DOMESDAY BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN A SMALL  
NAVE WITH A VERY SMALL SANCTUARY AT THE
EAST END.VERY SOON AFTER THIS,THE WHOLE
STRUCTURE WAS REBUILT BY THE NORMANS TO
A SIMILAR AN BUT OF LARGER DIMENSIONS. 
TOWARDS THE END OF THE 12TH CENTURY THE
SMALL SANCTUARY WAS GREATLY ENLARGED BY
THE ADDITION OF A FINELY  VAULTED      
CHANCEL;TRANSEPTS WERE ERECTED AND A   
CENTRAL TOWER ROSE FROM THE CROSSING   
PRESENTING THE POPULAR CRUCIFORM PLAN. 
FOUR BELLS WERE HUNG AT SOME TIME.     
IN THE NEXT CENTURY THE SOUTH AISLE WAS
ADDED AS FAR AS THE TRANSEPT WHILE THE 
NORTH AISLE AND THE LADY CHAPEL TO THE 
SOUTH OF THE CHANCEL WERE ADDED IN THE 
14TH CENTURY.IN THE 14TH  OR 15TH      
CENTURY WAS ERECTED THE ROOD LOFT AND  
SCREEN ACROSS THE EAST END OF THE NAVE,
THE STAIRS TO THE LOFT BEING CUT OUT OF
THE THICK WALL OF THE NORMAN NAVE.     </content>
