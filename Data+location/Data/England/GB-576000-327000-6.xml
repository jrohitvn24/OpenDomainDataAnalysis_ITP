		<title>06HOUGHTON HALL TODAY</title>
		<content> Structurally,the house is practically 
 as it was built.Robert Walpole's      
 grandson,GEORGE, had the steps removed
 from the East and West front when he  
 could not afford to pay for their     
 repair.A laundry and sick quarters    
 behind the picture gallery were       
 destroyed by fire in the nineteenth   
 century.Today there are steps,to the  
 original design,on the West front,    
 a replacement in 1973 by the now      
 DOWAGER MARCHIONESS of CHOLMONDELEY to
 commemorate her husband,the fifth     
 MARQUESS, who died in 1968. These     
 steps are of stone from HOLLINGTON in 
 STAFFORDSHIRE as the original AISLABY 
 quarries are no longer working.       
 Inside the house , pictures from the  
 Cholmondeley collection and pictures  
 and furniture from the collection of  
 PHILIP SASSOON, brother of the present
 dowager, compensate for earlier losses</content>
