		<content> Most of the houses in Borehamwood were
 built by the Council round about 30   
 years ago. Some of them have recently 
 been made available for their         
 occupants to purchase. There are      
 relatively few older properties, and  
 hardly any buildings more than 200    
 years old. All the flats have been    
 built by the Council since 1970.      
 Though some of the older flats are    
 situated above shops (and without     
 garages) the more recent ones have    
 better facilities and are in separate 
 blocks, of which the highest is       
 Canterbury House with 17 floors. This 
 is, in fact, by far the tallest       
 building in the area. Although there  
 was little house-building in the late 
 1970s, in the last few years there has
 been an expansion as land has become  
 available through the closure of      
 factories and film studio sites.      </content>
