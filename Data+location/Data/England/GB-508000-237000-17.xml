		<content>{ Clophill}stands on the{greensand     
{ridge}which stretches from{Sandy,}in  
 the east, to{Leighton Buzzard,}in the 
 west. This is a{sandstone}much used in
 building and in roadmaking. The{River 
{Flitt}bisects our area and has left a 
 fine{silt}over the aeons. With the    
 fertile soil and good drainage it is  
 an ideal place for vegetable growing. 
  There are isolated patches of{gault  
{clay,}said to be{fossilised dinosaur  
{dung,}which has been used to make     
 white bricks for local houses and     
 indeed for the tile manufacture once  
 a thriving industry in Kiln Lane.     
 Other{clays}make red bricks.          
  In the southern part of our area are 
 valuable deposits of{fullers earth    
 which have been extensively quarried  
 in the past. As one of these is under 
 our school we hope there is not a     
 sudden national shortage of it.       </content>
