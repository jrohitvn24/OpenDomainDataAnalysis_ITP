		<content> WHY WE MOVED TO FECKENHAM-A NEWCOMER  
   We decided that we wanted a more    
 rural life than we had in London. So  
 my husband looked for another job. He 
 found a job in Birmingham so we had to
 look for a house within commuting     
 distance of Birmingham.               
  We chose Feckenham as it was a small 
 unspoilt village with much charm and  
 character. It was not too cut off     
 having its own post office and a bus  
 service to Redditch. The bus is       
 important as I can't drive. It also   
 had its own village school and nursery
 this was essential as we have four    
 children.                             
  The house is a renovated barn in a   
 lovely position off the main road with
 a lovely veiw overlooking fields. It  
 is an ideal place for children, they  
 can play safely away from the traffic.
