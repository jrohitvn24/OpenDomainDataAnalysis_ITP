		<content> THE MOST RECENT ORDNANCE SURVEY MAPS  
 WE COULD GET WERE DATED{1977  (EIGHT  
{YEARS OLD).}THESE MAPS SHOWED A GREAT 
 NUMBER OF FARMS WITHIN OUR AREA.WE    
 FOUND ONLY ONE FROM OUR LIST          
 STILL EXISTED AS A WORKING FARM.MOST  
 OF THE OTHERS HAD DISAPPEARED         
 ALTOGETHER,THE LAND BEING USED FOR NEW
{HOUSING}AND{LINK ROADS}IN THE{LOWER   
{EARLEY}AREA,AND THE NEW{INDUSTRY}IN   
 THE{WINNERSH TRIANGLE}AREA.SOME SIGNS 
 OF THE FARMS WERE LEFT.WE DID FIND    
{LODDON STUD FARM -}THIS WAS NOW A     
{BUILDERS YARD,}BUT  THE STABLES WERE  
 STILL STANDING.THERE IS OBVIOUSLY NO  
 PLACE FOR{FARMING}IN THIS FAST        
 DEVELOPING AREA.NEW{HOUSING}AND       
{INDUSTRIAL BUILDING}HAVE CHANGED THE  
{CHARACTER}COMPLETELY.THERE IS VERY    
 LITTLE OPEN{FARMLAND}LEFT NOW,EXCEPT  
 IN THE MORE ESTABLISHED AREA NORTH OF 
{WINNERSH.                             </content>
