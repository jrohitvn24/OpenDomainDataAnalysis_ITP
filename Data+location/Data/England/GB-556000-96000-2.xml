		<title>02Ecology of the Downs 1</title>
		<content>    The landscape consists mainly of   
 downland used as rough grazing and of 
 scrub (inc. gorse, hawthorne, bramble 
 &amp; elder); the three farms in the area 
 also cultivate about one third of the 
 land with crops such as oats and      
 barley.                               
    All of the downland is public      
 property and even the farms are owned 
 by Eastbourne Corporation. This has   
 the result that where sheep no longer 
 graze and keep down the level of      
 plant-life this land has become       
 overgrown with scrub.                 
    Sheep are by far the best animals  
 for grazing the downland as they      
 prevent scrub growing to any height   
 without killing off the grass by      
 eating too close to the ground; also, 
 as they are not heavy, they do not    
 break the surface of the turf.
