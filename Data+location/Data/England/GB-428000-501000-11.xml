		<content> Asewing class is held every Tuesday in
 St Lukes Church vestry in N Cowton.   
 Members pay 20p for tea &amp; biscuits    
 which members bring on a rota basis.  
 Northallerton Education Committee     
 holds an evening sewing class weekly  
 in E Cowton school during the winter. 
 Over the years many village ladies    
 have attended embroidery, sewing, soft
 furnishings and upholstery classes.   
 Everyone helps each other in what they
 are most profficient at. The majority 
 enjoy knitting and crocheting. Some   
 make soft toys and two Brambley Lodge 
 mice were on the North Yorkshire W.I. 
 stand at the Great Yorkshire Show at  
 Harrogate in July 1985.               
 Quite a few ladies have been to flower
 arranging classes and won prizes at   
 Scorton show. All of the displays at  
 South Cowton Flower Festival were done
 by N &amp; S Cowton ladies.               </content>
