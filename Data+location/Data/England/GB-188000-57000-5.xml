		<content> A lot of the men work in the china    
 clay industry at the various pits     
 between Indian Queens and             
 St.Austell.The firm that employs them 
 is called E.C.L.P.and china clay is   
 sent all over the world.              
 Towards the coast and away from the   
 clay pits some men work on farms,as   
 the land is mostly farm land.         
 Many people,especially women, travel  
 to Truro,St.Austell or Newquay to work
 in shops or offices.In the summer     
 there are a lot of people who work in 
 hotels or restaurants because of the  
 large number of holidaymakers who     
 visit places like Newquay.Some people 
 have tourists stay overnight at their 
 house for bed and breakfast.          
 A few people work locally or have     
 their own business. Some of the young 
 people are unemployed,some don't seem 
 to mind.                              </content>
