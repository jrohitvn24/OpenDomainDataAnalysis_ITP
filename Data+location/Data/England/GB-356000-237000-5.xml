		<title>05MORDIFORD AREA HOUSING</title>
		<content>   70 % of all housing in the          
 Mordiford/ Dormington area, is council
 owned. Most of these properties date  
 from about 1930 _ 1960. Being council 
 owned,it is difficult to evaluate     
 them;and thus makes it impossible to  
 work out a meaningful average price   
 of residential property in the area.  
 This is largely because much of the   
 remaining housing consists mainly of  
 farm_steads and other largish rural   
 property (dating from 1500 _ 1850     
 approx).                              
    Since 1900 the only "major"        
 development in the  D-Block has been  
 the construction of a small estate of 
 "3 bedroom sized" council houses.     
 Apart from this "Sufton Rise" estate  
 there seems to have been little or no 
 development in recent years.
