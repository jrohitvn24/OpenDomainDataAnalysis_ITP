		<title>19JOBS IN DIPTFORD</title>
		<content> For centuries the people of Diptford  
 have been associated with the land.   
 Working on the{land}was the only      
 employment. Time and mechanisation    
 have changed that and now people have 
 had to find jobs away from Diptford.  
 This has meant using the car to go to 
 the major towns in the area to work in
 factories, offices, shops, and        
 construction work. The population of  
 Diptford is now{mobile}and this       
 mobility has meant a change in the    
 range of labour available. There is   
 now a large percentage of{professional
 people who are intergrated with the   
 local inhabitants. Finding work is    
 still a problem as the unemployment   
 rate is very high.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
