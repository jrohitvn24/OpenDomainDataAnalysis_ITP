		<content> The Kings Head is on the edge of the  
 village. It sells beer and coffee and 
 snacks and food. The Napton Bridge Inn
 is by the Oxford canal. The Bridge is 
 a public house and it is a restaurant.
 There are swings in the garden. It has
 a bar in it. Lots of people go there. 
 I go there a lot with my dad. It is   
 very nice there. I have cake and      
 crisps and sometimes I have lunch     
 there too. We went to the Crown Public
 House in the middle of the village.   
 They sell drinks and food. They open  
 at 11.00 am. during the week. They    
 have a games room for dominoes and    
 darts.
