		<title>15A day in Susan's life</title>
		<content> On Wednesday my mum or dad brings me a
 cup of tea. I take ages to get up.    
 When I'm ready I wait down the        
 driveway for Wendy. She takes me to   
 school. I do some work and then it is 
 assembly. At assembly we sing or talk 
 about things. Then it is playtime. On 
 Wednesday the playgroup came. My      
 friend is Sarah. She is four. After   
 play I finish my work. Then it is     
 dinner time. I have school dinners.   
 After we have another playtime then it
 is swimming. I am in the second group.
 Then it is story. Our story is called 
 'Little House in the Big Wood'. Then  
 we get our things. We stand behind our
 chairs. Then we go out. Wendy or Mummy
 comes to pick us up.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
