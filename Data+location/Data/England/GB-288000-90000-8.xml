		<title>08PAPER DELIVERY IN EXETER.</title>
		<content>   The main local newspaper in         
 Exeter                                
 is the Express and Echo. The paper    
 boys and girls deliver the papers and 
 get paid Â£2.80 a week. There are 6    
 paper girls and 5 boys altogether. The
 Express and Echo is delivered in the  
 evening.The paper boys and girls have 
 a plastic sheet in a plastic see-     
 through cover. These things tell them 
 which houses to deliver to. If a per  
 son is away then the newspaper boys   
 and girls turn over the strips so they
 know which ones not to deliver to     
   These things are called Moonstrips. 
 Most of the papers come from Fleet    
 Street and are picked up by a van. The
 newspaper boys and girls dont usually 
 go out of the area that they live in  
 because it is too far to go and they  
 would not know the roads well enough.
