		<title>07MELBURY RESERVOIR</title>
		<content>   The reservoir at Melbury is part of 
 the local network of reservoirs and is
 used to supplement Westward Ho!'s     
 water supply when other reservoirs are
 getting low. The pressure on the      
 water supplies is greater in  the     
 summer when there are large numbers of
 holiday makers in the North Devon     
 area.                                 
                                       
          Around the reservoir there is
 a lot of forestry. In the spring you  
 can sometimes see frogs spawn in one  
 corner. Sometimes fishermen can be    
 found fishing from the bank for trout.
 During the winter time a small number 
 of ducks can be found on the lake and 
 a pair of buzzards can be found in the
 area. Swallows, House Martins and     
 Wagtails are common around the        
 waterside and gulls (various) use the 
 water for roosting.                   </content>
