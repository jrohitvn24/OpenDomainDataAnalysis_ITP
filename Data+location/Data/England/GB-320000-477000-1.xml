		<content>      The greater part of the housing, 
 particularly in Askam, is terraced and
 up to 100 years old. Much of the      
 housing was of low standard but       
 recently has been modernised up to an 
 expected degree. Much of the          
 surrounding wasteland left after the  
 rundown of the Askam Iron Works has   
 been cleared and is providing         
 reasonable development areas.         
     The coastal areas provide         
 facilities for water sports and other 
 relaxations, notwithstanding the      
 problem of some unmade roads and      
 marshy land, access is quite          
 reasonable.                           
     A general view of the area from   
 coastal vantage points is enhanced by 
 the rising fells of the Lake District 
 National Park.
