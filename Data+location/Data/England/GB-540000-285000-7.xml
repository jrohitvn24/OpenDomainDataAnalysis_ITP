		<content> Barley is the most populor crop in    
 this area.  Also rape, wheat, peas,   
 beans, sugar beet, potatoes and       
 carrots are grown in large fields.    
 Most of these crops are suited to     
 clayey soil, where they grow best.    
 This clayey soil is to the South of   
 our area where the land rises to 10'  
 above sea level.  As the land drops to
 5'below sea level there is the edge of
 a three mile wide stretch of peaty    
 soil which is ideal for the carrots   
 for which Chatteris Fens are famous.  
 In Byall Fen there is a sixty acre    
 field of carrots.  In How and         
 Nightlayer's Fen the most populor     
 crop is barley,and in Langwood Fen    
 there are lots of potatoes.  Some of  
 these potatoes are used in the making 
 of some very famous crisps.
