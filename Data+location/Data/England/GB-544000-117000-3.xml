 is aware of the need to{conserve}areas
 of the farm. Since 1976 a variety of  
 projects have been undertaken.        
   A{pond}has been re_created from the 
 remains of a lake. Water-weeds,rushes,
 bulrushes,willow and others are now   
 established along with coot,mallard,  
 moorhen,frogs and Canada Geese. Silver
 birch,cherry and willow were planted  
 on the north bank. Another pond has   
 been dug which has an island left for 
 nesting. Over 100 trees were planted. 
   A field has been left in its{rough  
{natural state}for the past{50}years.  
 There are at least 68 different kinds 
 of grasses and flowers.               
   Twelve acres of a special variety of
 old wheat are grown for{corn dolly    
{making.}The old binder has been rest- 
 ored and in August corn sheaves can be
 seen stooked in the old way.          </content>
