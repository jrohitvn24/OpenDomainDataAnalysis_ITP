 The village of Halnaker stands on the 
 A285 from Chichester to Petworth. It  
 is a single street on the main road   
 and most of the houses are made of    
 sussex flint. There are no shops but  
 there is a single pub. Halnaker is    
 famous for its windmill that stands   
 high on the downs on Halnaker Hill and
 can be seen shining white for miles   
 around. The last man who remembers it 
 working has just died aged 92.        
 Halnaker Park is a large arable farm  
 next to Halnaker House. It has a very 
 high flint wall running all around it.
 All the farmland round the village is 
 excellent arable land. There is also a
 chicken processing factory at the     
 northern end of the village.
