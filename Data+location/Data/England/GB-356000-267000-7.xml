 Every year the{fair}comes for a few   
 days and then moves on.               
  Each year Tenbury has a              
{Carnival.}People dress up             
 beautifully in costumes and decorate  
 big lorries called "floats".We also   
 have a beauty contest and the person  
 who wins is called the "Carnival      
 Queen".We also have lots of stalls and
 a mini fair.                          
{ "Castle Tump"}is said to be where    
 Caractacus is buried.                 
   Every year Tenbury has a{show.      
{People}bring along their best         
 vegetables they have grown and they   
 win prizes. People also have prizes   
 for best cakes and marmalade etc. Also
 people bring along their best farm    
 animals in a competition and there is 
 a{gymkhana.
