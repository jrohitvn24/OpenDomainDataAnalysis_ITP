		<content> Gas, electricity, oil, coal and solar 
 panels provide domestic heating and   
 power for household and cooking       
 appliances. Almost every house has a  
 TV set, with 37% having 2 or more. 78%
 have a deep freeze; 60% a telephone;  
 20% a video recorder, microwave oven  
 and/or computer. 50% have 1 car, 22% 2
 and 9% 3 or more; 10% 1 or more motor-
 cycles; 70% 1 or more bicycles. All   
 homes have hot water, bath and inside 
 toilet. Daily baths or showers are    
 usual. Washing machines for clothes   
 and in some cases for dishes ease the 
 daily chores. There is also a public  
 launderette. Electric drills and other
 do-it-yourself tools reduce the need  
 for costly minor repairs etc and      
 encourage home improvements. A basic  
 40-hour working week and 2 week annual
 holidays at home or abroad allow time 
 for leisure and recreation at home    </content>
