		<title>14HOME LIFE: Day begins</title>
		<content>    Here are some{extracts}from        
{children}about how the day starts for 
 them:                                 
 1) Clink! Clink! The{milk's}here! I   
 turn over sleepily. I know I can't go 
 back to sleep. I look at the curtains.
 I can see it's sunny. Oh well, might  
 as well get up.                       
 2) It was eight o' clock this morning 
 when I got up. I opened my curtains   
 and the sun poured through the window.
 I went into the{bathroom}and turned on
 the taps and half-filled the bath with
 warm water, putting in a generous     
 helping of bath-salts.                
 3) 7.30 - got up, got washed, took my 
 football stickers downstairs, sorted  
 them out and had breakfast.           
 4) On most days I get up at 7.10. My  
{clock-radio}wakes me up so I'm never  
 late for{school.}
