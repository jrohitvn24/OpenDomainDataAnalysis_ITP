		<content> Farmhouses twelve scattered over the  
 area. Most dating from the late 18th  
 century, built of stone, said to be   
 from the Polden hills, now faced with 
 red brick for durability.             
 Farm facilities, all have dutch barns 
 for storage of hay &amp; straw, milking   
 parlours with concrete holding yards &amp;
 large covered yards known as cubicles 
 for housing milking cows or store     
 cattle in the winter.                 
 Outlying buildings each farm has      
 either a portable milking ball or a   
 permanent milking parlour in the area 
 of the pastures.                      
 Dwellings, a sprinkling of old stone  
 cottages mostly modernised &amp; used as  
 private houses, no tied cottages      
 remain. In the N.E. corner is an area 
 of infilling where ten new bungalows  
 are interspersed with old houses.
