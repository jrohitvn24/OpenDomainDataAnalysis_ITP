		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE OF KATIE</title>
		<content>         My dad usually wakes me with a
 cup of tea at 7.00 am. I then get     
 washed and dressed and have breakfast 
 of Cereals and Tea.                   
         I then catch the School bus to
 go to school. The journey takes about 
 45 mins. I sit on the back seat of the
 bus.                                  
        School starts at 9.00. At 9.15 
 we have French then Religion and      
 English.  After 15 mins Break we have 
 Maths. At 12.00 we have Dinner. We    
 have a '5 Star' canteen system. We    
 then have a Break till 1.00. After    
 that we have Craft or Science.        
 On Wednesday we have Games - usually  
 Rounders or Netball for the Girls     
 - Football for the Boys.              
        I get home about 4.00. I watch 
 T.V. have my Tea, do some Reading and 
 any other homework and go to bed at   
 about 9.30.                           </content>
