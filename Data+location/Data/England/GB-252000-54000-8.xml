		<content>    There is a new {Vetinary Surgery}  
 on the corner of Glaen Road and       
 Hillcrest Drive, Plympton. {The Vet is
{called Nigel Taylor.}                 
    The building that is there at the  
 moment is only temporary. The         
 permanent building will be built in   
 July. There are three surgeries and   
 they are also open in case of         
 emwegencies. The times of the         
 surgeries are:-                       
 9.00 - 10.00 am                       
 2.00 -  2.30 pm                       
 4.30 -  6.00 pm (by appointment)      
 Monday to Friday.                     
 9.30 - 10.30 am on Saturdays.         
   They have a carpark which you can   
 use when taking your animals to the   
 vet. They are very good at their work.
 It was a good idea to have a new vet  
 because most people have young        
 children and they have pets.R.Phillips</content>
