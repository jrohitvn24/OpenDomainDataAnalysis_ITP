		<title>08LIVING IN CHALFORD</title>
		<content>                                       
 I like living in Chalford because it  
 has so many steep woods and fields.The
 village is very long with lots of     
 narrow,twisty roads and drystone      
 walls.There is a Roundhouse by the    
 canal that canal workers used to live 
 in.This old village in the Golden     
 Valley is sometimes said to be the    
 second largest village in England.Most
 of the houses are built from Cotswold 
 stone which used to be quarried       
 locally.                              
   People here have television but,if  
 you live in the valley,you will get   
 poor reception because of the hills.  
 I like to see the gliders which are   
 often flying overhead from the Gliding
 Cub at the old Aerodrome at Aston     
 Down.You can also watch trains        
 travelling through the valley to and  
 from London.                          </content>
