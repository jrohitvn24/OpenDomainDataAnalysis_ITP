		<title>11Wytham Woods</title>
		<content> When interviewed, the Forester said   
 that 1/3rd of Wytham Estate is covered
 by woodland.All the common trees grow 
 in the woods. One oak tree is 700     
 years old. The woods are an open-air  
 laboratory for the University: 40     
 different projects are being developed
 this year. Animals and plants are     
 studied. The Forester is responsible  
 for preserving and renewing the woods.
 This is very much a full time         
 occupation. He looks after the trees  
 in the woods, in the village, on the  
 farms, and liaises with the           
 University. Felling and planting are  
 his concern: May to November is his   
 busiest time The village is a         
 conservation area and no trees can be 
 felled without planning permission.   
 Within the woods, in recent years, a  
 saw-mill has been established: 3 of   
 the 5 men employed live in the village</content>
