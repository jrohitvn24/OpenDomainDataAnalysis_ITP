		<title>13EMPLOYMENT IN WYDDIAL</title>
		<content>  Jobs exist in the area on the farms, 
 in the quarry, in the small industrial
 units at Silkmead and with the race   
 horses there.However only two of the  
 residents of the village are farm     
 workers. Labour is mobile. Most of the
 working population travel out of the  
 area, some to London, some working    
 away all the week and returning at    
 weekends. Some travel to the nearby   
 towns. A few including a stock broker 
 and an agricultural engineer work from
 home. There is no identifiable pattern
 of employment. Conversely the work    
 actually performed in the area is     
 undertaken by people who travel in to 
 do it. Farm workers no longer live in 
 tied cottages and a tractor driver has
 no responsibility for stock.
