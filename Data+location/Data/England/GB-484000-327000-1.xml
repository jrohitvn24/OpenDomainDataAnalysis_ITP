		<title>01KING LUD'S AREA near Saltby.</title>
		<content> Situated east and south-east of       
 Croxton Kerrial, and north-east of    
 Saltby, the area consists essentially 
 of a limestone plateau situated at an 
 elevation of 150 metres above sea     
 level. Consisting almost entirely of  
 farmland, mainly non-grass crops, the 
 area has a history going back possibly
 as far as the Bronze Age in the form  
 of ancient roads and with             
 archaeological remains possibly from  
 the Dark Ages.                        
 In more recent times farmland was     
 taken over for a 2nd World War        
 airfield; this is now being reclaimed 
 for farm- and woodland.               
 The geological and geographical       
 situation has made the area an        
 important one from the point of view  
 of limestone grassland conservation.
