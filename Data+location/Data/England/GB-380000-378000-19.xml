		<title>19SEWAGE WORKS IN WILMSLOW</title>
		<content>  There are 2 sewage works in the area.
  The sewage is piped from roads,houses
 and drains in Alderley_edge and       
 Wilmslow.                             
  It goes through a grid which removes 
 tin cans, rags, bottles etc. Grit is  
 pumped off the bottom and into the    
 side tanks.Then it enters two big     
 sediment tanks where air is pumped in 
 and bacteria added. Sludge that       
 remains is treated again then pumped  
 onto farm land. The clean water goes  
 into the brook.                       
{  The plant covers a large area.The   
{machinery is quite old.The building   
{was modernised in the 1960's. Three   
{people work there. One enjoys his job 
{because he has a variety of things to 
{do. Some times they need life jackets 
{or breathing apparatus.
