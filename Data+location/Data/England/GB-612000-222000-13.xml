		<content>   In Weeley there is an Ambulance     
 Station which is 15 years old. We went
 to the Station to interview the men   
 there and they gave us information    
 about themselves and the Station.     
 They have 2 shift vehicles, 3 day     
 vehicles, 8 shift workers, 6 day      
 workers, 3 reliefs and 1 Station      
 Officer.                              
   The shifts go from 7am to 3pm; 3pm  
 to 11pm; 10.30am to 6.30pm and 8am to 
 5pm.                                  
   The first man we interviewed had for
 breakfast Weetabix, toast, and a cup  
 of tea. He had worked at the Station  
 for 10 years and was very happy.  His 
 favourite food are salads, casseroles,
 fish, rice and roasts. His favourite  
 drink is coffee.                      
   Like most people we talked to, he   
 thinks that the people of Weeley are  
 very friendly and sociable.           </content>
