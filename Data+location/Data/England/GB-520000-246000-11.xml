		<title>11PIG FARMING IN SUTTON</title>
		<content>          CHURCH FARM                  
 Church Farm is a pig farm opposite the
 church.It used to be a dairy farm     
 until 1947 when the family of the     
 present owners decided to become pig  
 farmers.The farmhouse is part Tudor   
 and part Stuart.                      
 THere are about 400 pigs on the farm  
 which need constant attention.Feeding 
 takes about 2 hours and mucking-out   
 has to be done every day including    
 Christmas Day.Older pigs are fed on   
 large cobs and piglets are given      
 creep-feed which is smaller pieces of 
 food mixed with apple juice.The sows  
 have piglets twice a year.Soon after  
 they are born,the piglets have their  
 tails cut off to stop them being      
 bitten by other piglets.When the pigs 
 weigh 55Kg,they are sent to another   
 farm to be fattened for bacon.
