		<title>08THE NATIONAL PEAK PARK</title>
		<content> The Peak Park(the word Peak coming    
 from the Old English word Peac meaning
 hill or knoll)was created in 1954 &amp;   
 covers an area of 542 sq.miles.The aim
 in its creation was to provide a rural
 area of great beauty as a recreation  
 area for city folk &amp; also to protect  
 by means of bye_laws enforced by Park 
 Rangers,this beautiful countryside.   
 About 56 people,including 16 Rangers &amp;
 9 Planners are employed to run the    
 Peak Park.This Park lies at the point 
 where North &amp; South meet &amp; so both    
 Northern &amp; Southern plants can be     
 found here:plants such as purple moor 
 grass,bog asphodel,lichens,rushes     
 &amp; heather.Rare birds,such as Goshawks 
 nest here &amp; are protected by the      
 Rangers.Many species of newt live in  
 the valleys.
