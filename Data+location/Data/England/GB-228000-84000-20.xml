		<title>20Working On The Rectangle</title>
		<content> Two of the compilers live in our      
 rectangle. Rebecca Davis lives at     
 Langore and Bonny Shanks lives at     
 Little Athill.Amanda Frain moved from 
 our rectangle recently.Our teacher    
 found it very difficult to organise   
 child coverage of the area but we     
 helped him along.The Head Compiler was
 Victoria Whitaker,ably assisted by    
 Sharon Jasper and Donna Nuttley.Other 
 helpers were Donna Volz, Amanda Frain,
 Jason Woodridge and Ashley Crawshaw.We
 found it difficult to decide on       
 suitable keywords.We have enjoyed     
 going out visiting places and have    
 learned much more about our area      
 because of our visits.It would be hard
 to imagine what our area will be like 
 nine hundred years from now.
