		<title>12VARIETY SHOW.</title>
		<content> Every year our village gets together  
 and we make{a variety show.}In the    
 show we usually have singing and      
 dancing and comedy acts.The show goes 
 on for three nights on a Thursday,    
 Friday,and Saturday. We usually have a
 party on the last night.The show is   
 held at the Village Hall in Oreton.The
 show is held in the month of April.I  
 have been in the show since I  was    
 four years old,and I have always      
 enjoyed joining in with the fun.The   
 money raised goes to the Oreton       
 village Hall.The first show was done  
 in Jubilee year 1977.
