 The population in 1905 was 1541       
 compared to the population in 1810    
 which was around the 2000 mark. The   
 population now is 1590. As you will   
 see the population has not differed   
 much between 1905 - 1985. Six housing 
 estates have been developed Bowring   
 Mead and Bidder Close in the south of 
 the town,Embleford Cresant,Fordlands  
 and Queens Road in the north of the   
 town and Mount Pleasant in the centre.
 There used to be two schools in       
 Moretonhampstead one for boys and one 
 for girls.The boys school is no longer
 used but the girls school has been    
 made into a Primary School for boys   
 and girls.In this time the pubs have  
 decreased from thirteen in number too 
 five now.
