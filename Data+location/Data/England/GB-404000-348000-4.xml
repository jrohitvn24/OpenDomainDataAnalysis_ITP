		<content>The area is lucky as it has not too    
much unemployment. On the edge of      
Waterhouses is a newly built           
industrial estate. One of the units is 
occupied by a pottery-making company   
producing plant pot novelties. There   
are 8 full time workers and 28 part    
timers. Another of the units is used   
by a firm which sells greeting cards,  
gift wrapping paper, stationery and    
art-work film. 3 people are employed   
here and 6 or 7 part time workers when 
required. Near to the factory units is 
an agricultural supplier and petrol    
station, which employs 7 full time     
workers.                               
There are a lot of farms in the area.  
Usually the men on the smaller farms   
have another job. But local employment 
is dominated by the quarry.(See page   
3).
