		<title>20Prestwood  Birth/Transport</title>
		<content>In Prestwood in 1881 about 9 tenths of 
the population were born in Bucks. Of  
those not born in Bucks, only 1 in 365 
were born abroad. One of these was the 
Vicar. Of the children in P.M.S. in    
1985, 1 in 15 were born abroad, 2 out  
of 3 were born in Bucks, and about 3   
out of 10 were born in U.K. but outside
Bucks. Perhaps these facts reflect     
changes in transport systems. Of P.M.S.
children:- 11/12 have used the Tube    
           19/30 have used a taxi      
          179/180 have used a bus/coach
          7/9 have used a ship or ferry
           19/36 have used a passenger 
                            airliner   
            1/6 have used a hovercraft.
