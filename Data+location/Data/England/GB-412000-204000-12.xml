		<title>12Hatherop Castle</title>
		<content>{ Hatherop Castle}is not a castle it   
 is a large manor house. The present   
 building was first built in           
 Elizabethan times but sadly in 1860s  
 much of it was destroyed when a candle
 set light to a bedroom curtain .      
 There are many curious stories        
 concerning the castle between 1862 and
 1867 it was owned by the{Maharajah    
{Dulip Singh},who caused consternation 
 by taking potshots with a rifle at the
 deer in the gardens of{Williamstrip   
{House.}As the path of the bullets     
 crossed the road the villagers felt   
 that they were under attack.          
 During the Second World War secrecy   
 descended on the castle for it was    
 taken over by the{Special Operations  
{Executive S.O.E.}It was used for the  
 training of agents who were later     
 parachuted into occupied Denmark.
