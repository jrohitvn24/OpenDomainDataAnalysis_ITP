		<title>07BUILDINGS MUSEUM, BROMSGROVE</title>
		<content> Bromsgrove's{open-air museum}of build-
 ings, Avoncroft, was  begun  in  the  
 1960's.It was the first of its kind in
 Britain  and  grew  out of a desire on
 the part of a group of people ,led  by
 an architect,Freddie Charles,to save a
 magnificent {Elizabethan  merchant's }
{house}(1480) soon to be demolished in 
 the town.The house was removed to a{15
{acre site} piece  by  numbered  piece,
 timbers  repaired, restored  to  their
 original  beauty, and  re-erected, the
 operation taking  volunteers  2 years.
 Now the museum  has{18  old  buildings
 whose {architectural  and   historical
{value}made  preservation desirable but
 whose original sites were required for
 modern development.                   
 Those  instrumental in  creating  this
 fascinating museum  hope visitors will
 see and value {architectural beauty}in
 their own environment.                </content>
