		<content> Shopping Survey                       
 Our survey showed that 22 people think
 that the area in which they live is   
 convenient for local shops.16 people  
 think that the prices are not too high
 compared with other areas.We found    
 that most people use both supermarkets
 and local shops.Most people get what  
 they run out of at corner shops.From  
 the supermarkets people buy almost all
 their week's shopping.The majority use
 Asda and Sainsbury's and find their   
 prices reasonable. The supermarkets   
 are usually visited once a week and   
 the local shops several times.We found
 that most people visit the City centre
 once a week and buy fruit and         
 vegetables,clothes,shoes,electrical   
 goods and furniture.Most people use   
 the local fish shop and take-aways    
 once or twice a week.Very few people  
 shop on Sundays                       </content>
