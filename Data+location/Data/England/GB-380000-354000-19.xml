		<title>19HARECASTLE TUNNEL KIDSGROVE</title>
		<content> A dominant feature of the area is the 
 Trent and Mersey Canal, one of the    
 earliest Brindley canals. It formerly 
 had an extensive narrow-boat traffic  
 between the Potteries and the Mersey. 
 In recent years this traffic had      
 declined severely. The canal is now   
 used for pleasure boats. It is        
 expensive to maintain because the area
 is subject to mining subsidence.      
  On its way through the area the canal
 passes through the Harecastle Tunnel. 
  The original entrance from the       
 Cheshire side has been blocked off and
 a new one constructed. The entrance is
 well sign posted from The Avenue and  
 from the railway station at Kidsgrove.
  While re-lining work was being       
 carried out in 1984 a number of canal 
 workers were trapped and had to be    
 rescued by firemen.
