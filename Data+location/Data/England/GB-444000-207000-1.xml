		<content> In spite of its proximity to Oxford   
 this rural area is very different from
 the urban developments to the north   
 and west of the city. Wytham village  
 stands in countryside which is well   
 wooded and hilly.Wytham Estate passed 
 to the University in 1942 on condition
 that its natural beauty was preserved.
 Building was to be limited. Almost all
 of the 3000 acre estate lies within   
 the block. The Great Wood spreads from
 the Seacourt stream to the Thames at  
 Swinford. The river meanders through  
 farmland, feeding Farmoor reservoir in
 the west. The little of the modern    
 village of Farmoor in the block is in 
 marked contrast with the conservation 
 area of Wytham. Even linked with the  
 Swinford complex of bridge, lock and  
 waterworks, this area is overshadowed 
 by the older, unchanged village.
