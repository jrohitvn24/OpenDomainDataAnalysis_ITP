		<title>09BROWNIES AND GUIDES</title>
		<content> The 1st Okehampton Brownie Pack has 24
 brownies in four sixes which are      
 Elves, Imps, Sprites and Pixies. The  
 1st Okehampton Guide Company has 30   
 guides in six patrols which are       
 Kingfisher, Bluetits, Robins, Thrush, 
 Chaffinch and Swallow. In May 1984,   
 the new Guide H.Q. was opened by the  
 Mayoress, Mrs B. Savage. The brownies 
 and guides are now enjoying the       
 freedom of their own premises.        
 1985 celebrates 75 years of guiding.  
 The pack and company have joined in   
 various events to celebrate the year. 
 In September, a big fun day is being  
 held at Okehampton College for the    
 guides and brownies of the divison. On
 June 26 the district met at the Taw   
 Green camp-site to collect their      
 'lights' from the candle lit in London
 by H.R.H. Princess Margaret to remind 
 them of their guiding light.          </content>
