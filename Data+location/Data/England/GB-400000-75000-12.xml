		<title>12Anvil Point Lighthouse</title>
		<content>      The most southerly tip of land in
 our study area is Anvil Point.        
 Situated on limestone cliffs          
 overlooking the English Channel is a  
 lighthouse. It was built in 1881 by   
 Trinity House and is now fully        
 automatic, the light revolving every  
 ten seconds. There is one principal   
 keeper who lives on the site to       
 maintain and oversee its working.     
      The lighthouse is equipped with a
 fully automatic fog horn that can be  
 heard up to a distance of eighteen    
 miles away.                           
      There are many buildings         
 surrounding the main tower and the    
 whole area is enclosed by a white     
 perimeter wall of about one and a half
 to two metres in height.
