		<title>18Wellow Village</title>
		<content>    A{maypole on the green}at Wellow is
 one of only three permanent poles in  
 Britain. At one time the pole was cut 
 from Sherwood Forest, a few miles to  
 the west, but the present one is made 
 of steel and was erected in 1976. This
 year's celebrations were marred by    
 drunken behaviour by just a few of    
 the large crowd, trouble of this kind 
 never having occurred before.         
     Around the green are 17th and     
 18th century red-brick and pantiled   
 houses and cottages, each one built in
 a different style.Close by is a       
 Methodist chapel built in 1847 and the
 small parish church of St Swithin     
 dating from the 12th century.         
     A lane climbs up from the village 
 to{Wellow Park,}the site of a circular
 hill-fortress, 250ft in diameter,     
 known as{Jordan's Castle,}which is    
 surrounded by a broad moat.           </content>
