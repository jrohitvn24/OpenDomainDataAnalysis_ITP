 In 1981, the population of this       
 village was 1,440. The main           
 developments in the village have been 
 since 1945 but all development is     
 strictly monitored as the village is  
 located in the High Weald Area of Out-
 standing Beauty. The area between Ash-
 urstwood and East Grinstead  is called
 a "strategic gap". There is to be no  
 development in this area unless a very
 good reason is offered.The council has
 taken this course of action in an     
 attempt to "protect and enhance" the  
 identity of the village. Only         
 infilling and development of          
 individual houses will be considered  
 by the council and at present no sites
 have been proposed for development.
