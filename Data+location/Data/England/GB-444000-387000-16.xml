   Guilthwaite Grange was originally   
 built in 1760 but it was fully        
 restored in 1972 by the present owner.
 The out buildings were built in the   
 fourteenth century and many of the    
 original beams and walls can be seen. 
 The house is set in two acres of land.
 Fruit trees grow in the garden,many of
 which are cider apple trees,planted by
 the previous owner.Also growing in the
 garden is an apple-pear tree the fruit
 of which tastes like an apple and     
 looks like a pear.                    
        The house was almost completely
 re-built when the present owners      
 bought the farm building.At present it
 has fourteen large and attractive     
 rooms.Across the kitchen ceiling is a 
 large wooden beam.This is not the     
 original one because that rotted away.
