  Down Thorney Bay Road there is a big 
 Caravan Park, where people can stay   
 for their holidays. I think there were
 about a thousand caravans on the site.
 We walked thorugh the camp from the   
 sea wall.It is mainly old people that 
 we saw with their carvans in the camp,
 because the school holidays hadn't    
 started. Outside the camp there is a  
 row of trees which are used as a wind 
 break. There is a lake that flows     
 thorugh the camp. Some of the caravans
 are old and tarmac roads go through   
 the site.Beside the roads there are   
 signs that say "No Skateboarding" In  
 the camp there is a row of carvans for
 sale or hire.I know that because me   
 and my dad had a look thorugh the     
 window of the caravan. We didn't buy  
 the caravan because we thought it was 
 too expensive.                        </content>
