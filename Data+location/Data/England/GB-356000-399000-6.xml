		<content> This stretch of land was a group of   
 mine tips, which underwent            
 reclamation.  It has one lake and two 
 ponds.  Now part of the countryside is
 being taken up by an industrial       
 estate.  The main attraction is the   
 racing arena.Also there is a BMX      
 course that is owned by HDB (Hindley  
 and District BMX) and is famous with  
 Kellogs BMX challenge.  There are     
 nature trails all round the "Three    
 Sisters" and a large wood called      
 "Crippins Wood" at the far end.  The  
 recreation area stretches as far back 
 as the Wigan Flashes.  The work is    
 nearly completed and, when it is the  
 Queen is coming to see it, as she did 
 when the reclamation first started.   
 Many events are taking place on       
 the lake, and on the track and it is  
 becoming Ashtons tourist attraction.
