 asked them to answer a questionnaire. 
 We found that{85.8%}of our parents go 
 to work. Of these{61.8%}travel to     
 Stockport, Manchester, or further to  
 their job.  Although there are three  
 industrial estates within Norbury     
 (Hazel Grove) only{38.2%}work locally.
 Most people travel to work by car -   
{69.7%}travelling this way.{75.3%}use  
 either car or train, while{24.7%      
 either walk,cycle or bus to work. Of  
 the ladies sampled{28.3%}are          
 housewives only.  Similar questions   
 were asked of people living in a high 
 cost housing area of Poynton.         
 Of 86 households surveyed, it was     
 found that a quarter of the people    
 were retired. Of the remainder,{66.6%
