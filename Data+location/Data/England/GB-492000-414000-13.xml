		<title>13STRAW BURNING_ADVANTAGES</title>
		<content>   In 1985{straw burning}is becoming a 
 matter of{public concern.             
   In this area of England straw has   
 been burnt after harvest for 30 years.
 It is a quick, effective and          
 inexpensive method of disposal and has
 several advantages for the farmer.    
   Not least of these is speed_with the
 right weather a field can be burnt    
 within an hour or so. An important    
 factor now that so much of the cereal 
 crop is{drilled}in the Autumn. Burning
 brings a considerable kill of weed    
 seeds and reduces bacterial deseases  
 helping to produce a 'clean' seed bed 
 into which to drill the following     
 crop. It is very economical because it
 needs very little labour to supervise 
 the fire and little or{no extra       
{machinary}in the field and requires   
 less{chemical sprays}to achive a good 
 seed bed.                             </content>
