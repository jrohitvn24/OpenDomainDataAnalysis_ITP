		<title>13LANGFORD BUDVILLE CHURCH</title>
		<content> We are not certain when our church was
 actualy built but we think it was     
 built in the 14th century.Before that 
 there was a chapel. The church is made
 of a red sandstone with moss and      
 lichen growing up it. There are 7     
 stained glass windows made of coloured
 glass and strips of lead. The pulpit, 
 the altar, and the chancel pews are   
 beautifully carved in wood. The other 
 pews are also made of wood. The big   
 wooden door, to enter the church, is  
 inside the porch. Outside there are   
 lots of different graves, some are    
 very old, and some are quite new.     
 There are also some tombs. The tower  
 has a clock that faces the school and 
 on the top there is a flag pole. The  
 flag represents Saint George.
