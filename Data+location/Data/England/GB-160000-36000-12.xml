		<title>12FRADDAM</title>
		<content> The densest area of population is the 
 hamlet of Fraddam which had many more 
 cottages during the early part of the 
 century, its last shop closing 7 years
 ago. The pub remains structurally     
 unaltered but modernised inside.      
 The thatched cottage opposite the     
 pub burned down in about 1930. A      
 bungalow was built on the site and    
 now several acres of glass            
 constitute a very fine nursery.Fraddam
 has had 2 garages for many years.     
 Originally one was a bus company      
 having a bus with a lorry body for    
 haulage on weekends and a bus body for
 Saturdays. Most of the residents were 
 miners and quarry men. When mining    
 ended the area became derilict until  
 it was developed into a landscaped    
 campsite. In recent years various     
 mining companies have shown interest  
 in tin exploration.                   </content>
