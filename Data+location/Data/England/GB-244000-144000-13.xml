		<title>13WOOLACOMBE METHODIST CHURCH</title>
		<content>     Woolacombe Methodist Church, with 
 its spacious Sunday School Room       
 beneath and adjoining car park, is    
 situated in Beach Road. The first     
 Bible Christian meetings in           
 Woolacombe were held in a loft over   
 the archway next to Woolacombe Dairy, 
 reached by a ladder. Later their      
 services were held at Barton Farm     
 where Mr &amp; Mrs Thomas Beer were the   
 tenants. In 1889 a Bible Christian    
 Mission Hall was built.  The present  
 Methodist Church was built in 1893.   
 As with the Methodist Church at       
 Mortehoe, it is included in the       
 Ilfracombe Circuit. The present       
 membership is 22.
