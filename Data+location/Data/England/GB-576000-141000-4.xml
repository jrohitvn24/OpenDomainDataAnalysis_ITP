		<title>04The Church's Saxon Door.</title>
		<content>   The south door has been dated at    
 1040 which means that it displays some
 of the oldest ironwork in England.    
   It tells the story of Ragnorak THE  
 NORSE DAY OF JUDGEMENT which starts   
 with a cockrel crowing while a night  
 watchman blows his horn to call the   
 Gods to a battle.The seals rush onto  
 the land and Midgard,the serpent,grows
 until he can encircle the world.Other 
 monsters fight the Ship of the Dead   
 which the Gods are on.Thorsur,the     
 Sunwheel,throws sheets of flame over  
 the earth.The stars fall from the     
 heavens while above flies Nithoggr,who
 feeds on the slain.However,above him  
 is a cross the symbol of a new hope   
 coming, and a Christian end to the    
 Norse legend.The door has recently    
 been away at an exhibition but is now 
 back in its place in the south doorway
 of the church.                        </content>
