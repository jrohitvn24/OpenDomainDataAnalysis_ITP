Up  until  the Second World  War,  most
farms   in   the   area   were   almost
completely self-sufficient.  Specialist
occupations   such   as   thatcher   or
blacksmith  were available within  this
area.  Any  shopping was  done  at  the
local village store as at Ranton rather
than in a nearby town such as Stafford.
Farm labourers lived in tied  cottages,
the  surrounding land  often  used  for
rearing   pigs and poultry and  growing
garden  produce. Perks from the  farmer
might   include   milk   and   potatoes
A piece  of  beef  or a goose might  be
provided at Christmas.
