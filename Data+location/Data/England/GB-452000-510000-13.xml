		<content> The oldest church in Great Ayton is   
 All Saints Church, built in the 12th  
 century.  It had a spire that         
 collapsed then a tower which was      
 demolished in 178O.  Most of the      
 stained glass was destroyed in the    
 Reformation and replaced in the 19th  
 century.  The oldest object in the    
 church is the 6th century Saxon       
 crucifix.  A gravestone marks where   
 most of James Cook's family are       
 buried.  Flutings on the porch walls  
 were reputedly made by warriors       
 sharpening spears.  The Catholics, who
 obviously once owned this church, now 
 have a modern brick church behind the 
 Buck Hotel.                           
                                       
 The churches run Youth Clubs and the  
 church hall is used for village       
 functions, lectures, jumble sales etc.
