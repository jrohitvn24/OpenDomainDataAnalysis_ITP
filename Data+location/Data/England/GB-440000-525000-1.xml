		<content>   THE AREA JUST NORTH WEST OF STOCKTON
 IS CENTRED AROUND WYNYARD HALL AND ITS
 6500 ACRE ESTATE OWNED BY LORD        
 LONDONDERRY. THE ESTATE COVERS MOST OF
 THE AREA INCLUDING A LAKE AND SEVERAL 
 SMALL WOODS. THE WOODS ARE MOSTLY     
 DECIDUOUS EXCEPT FOR THE ODD SCATTERED
 COPSE OF CONIFEROUS TREES. THE  AREA  
 IS SPARSELY POPULATED, NO VILLAGES OR 
 TOWNS ONLY THE OCCASIONAL FARMS. THE  
 FARMING IS VIRTUALLY ALL ARABLE EXCEPT
 FOR A FEW SHEEP AND CATTLE. THE A689  
 RUNS THROUGH THE EAST OF THE AREA BUT 
 APART FROM THAT, THERE IS A LACK OF   
 ROADS. THERE ARE NO SHOPS, JUST THE   
 ARANVALE PLANT NURSERIES. THE DISUSED 
 CASTLE EDEN RAILWAY WHICH WAS OWNED BY
 THE NORTH EASTERN RAILWAY COMPANY WAS 
 CLOSED DOWN IN 1966 AND THE TRACK     
 PULLED UP IN 1979. IT IS NOW OWNED BY 
 THE CLEVELAND COUNTY COUNCIL AND HAS  
 BEEN MADE INTO A NATURE TRAIL. HEADING</content>
