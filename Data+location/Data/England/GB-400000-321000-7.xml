The farmer at Moreton House Farm also  
farms Moreton Barn Farm. He is the only
tenant farmer in the area. The present 
owners did own more farmland locally   
but these farms have now been sold.    
He farms a total area of about 340     
acres. Moreton House itself is now a   
private house. The farm buildings were 
built inside the large walled garden of
the original Moreton House. Much of the
wall is still visible and one part is  
built as a double wall. The farmer says
the double wall is probably 300 years  
old, and was heated so that peaches    
could be grown on its south face. The  
holes where the fires were lit have    
been covered but soot can be seen in   
the wall. Close by the farm may well   
have been the site of Moreton Manor:   
although nothing can be seen the farmer
has ploughed up sandstone blocks here. </content>
