		<content>    Transport is mainly the large bus  
service and the railway station.The bus
station is situated in the middle of   
Accngton near the market.It is run     
mainly by Hyndburn buses but Ribble    
buses have a share in it as well.The   
train station is situated out of the   
block but is another major part in     
transport.The major roads  are roads   
such as Manchester,Blackburn and       
Burnley which all lead out of          
Accrington.Manchester road is one of   
the large important roads and was built
by John Metcalfe in the 1790's.There   
were turn pikes at church lane ends and
Grange bridge but the tall houses have 
vanished.The only surviving example is 
the "Bar House" in Oak Hill Park which 
dates from the 19th century.When the   
roads are being repaired you can       
sometimes see the old tramlines        
underneath.                            </content>
