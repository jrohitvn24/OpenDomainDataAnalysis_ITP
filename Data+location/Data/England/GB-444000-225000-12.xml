		<content> There is no doctor's surgery or       
 clinic. Most people are registered    
 with the doctors at Deddington Health 
 Centre to which a minibus service     
 operates twice weekly. The area is    
 within the Oxfordshire Area Health    
 Authority.                            
 Home helps give assistance to sick or 
 disabled people in their own homes. A 
 meals on wheels service is provided   
 for the sick and disabled on a twice  
 weekly basis.                         
 Most of the children attend Steeple   
 Aston Dr. Radcliffe's C.E. Primary    
 School (130) pupils. This school is   
 able to draw on funds from the Dr.    
 Radcliffe Trust. There is a playgroup 
 for younger children. Buses take older
 children to the Warriner School in    
 Bloxham.
