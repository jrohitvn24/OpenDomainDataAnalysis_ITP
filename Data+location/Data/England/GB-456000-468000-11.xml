		<title>11Old Chapel</title>
		<content> On 28 February 1784 a chapel was built
 in Key Lane and the original Deeds are
 complete with seals and signatures in 
 the possession of Mrs Meadowcroft     
 whose family bought the chapel.       
                                       
 The chapel was not used after 1902 for
 services as there was a new one built 
 on Church Hill. Whenthe Meadowcroft   
 family took over the chapel in 1960 it
 still contained some pews and the     
 balcony.When these were removed to    
 make a workshop a large bible was     
 found dated 1781 hidden under balcony 
 floorboards. This is in the possession
 of Mrs Meadowcroft and was printed by 
 York firm. The chapel was used as a   
 garage for a traction engine until    
 1971 when Mr Meadowcroft died. It is  
 no longer in use but still belongs to 
 Mrs Meadowcroft.
