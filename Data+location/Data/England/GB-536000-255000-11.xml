		<title>11THE LOCAL MP'S</title>
		<content> On Tuesday 2nd May,1985,we had        
 our County Election.                  
 The people who stood were SUSAN BLOW, 
 for ALLIANCE, MIKE WEAVER, for LABOUR 
 and ROBERT JAMES for CONSERVATIVES.   
 In the 1980's our voting system is    
 such that before the election every   
 householder fills in a document about 
 the residents in their home and this  
 goes to make an electors register.    
 Two weeks before the election the     
 voter gets a card with the electoral  
 number on it.                         
 On Polling day you get a polling slip 
 from the polling clerk on which you   
 put an 'X' for the person you want to 
 vote for. The Polling Station was in  
 the old village hall which has been   
 there since the first world war.      
 The result was that ROBERT JAMES was  
 relected for a saet on the County     
 Council for the Comberton Ward.       </content>
