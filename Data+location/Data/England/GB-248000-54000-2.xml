		<content> There is a large house in Efford,     
 Plymouth, which is built on the       
 original site of Ebb Ford Manor House,
 which was mentioned in the original   
 Domesday Book. The name Ebb Ford comes
 from the ford across the River Plym at
 ebb tide. The sunken lane and Devon   
 hedges nearby are thought to be part  
 of the original lane leading from the 
 Manor House to the ford. The name Ebb 
 Ford has gradually changed over the   
 years to Efford, which is now the name
 of a suburb of Plymouth. The name     
 Plymouth comes from the mouth of the  
 River Plym, which is small river      
 flowing from Dartmoor, but with a     
 beautiful tidal estuary.
