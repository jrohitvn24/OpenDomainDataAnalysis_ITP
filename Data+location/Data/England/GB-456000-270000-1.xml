		<title>01AREA AROUND CRICK AND KILSBY</title>
		<content>  Our area is in Northamptonshire and  
 contains two villages : Kilsby and    
 Crick. As we live in the countryside  
 there is more farmland than anything  
 else. The agricultural area is mostly 
 grazing land with pockets of          
 cultivated grass and crops. There are 
 two important roads transversing the  
 area: the A5 and the M1 motorway. We  
 also have a railway which goes from   
 Birmingham to London. The Oxford Union
 canal passes through Crick. An        
 important historical feature is the   
 site of the old Roman Road (Watling   
 Street) which also crosses the square.
