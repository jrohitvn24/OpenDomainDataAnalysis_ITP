		<title>11HISTORY OF BATTLE ABBEY CONT</title>
		<content> FOUNDATIONS REMAINED.THE FLOOR-PLANS  
 OF THE REFECTORY AND KITCHEN ARE ALSO 
 VISIBLE.ONLY PART OF THE SOUTH AISLE  
 WALL OF THE CHURCH REMAINS,AS DOES THE
 13TH CENTURY CRYPT,BUT THE SHAPE OF   
 THE NORMAN CHURCH HAS BEEN OUTLINED   
 AND THE SITE OF THE HIGH ALTAR        
 (TRADITIONALLY THE SITE OF HAROLD'S   
 DEATH IN THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS) IS   
 ALSO MARKED.THE GUEST HOUSE WAS       
 REBUILT BY BROWNE FOR PRINCESS        
 ELIZABETH BUT NEVER USED AND WAS      
 LARGELY DEMOLISHED IN THE 1700'S. THE 
 GATE-HOUSE STILL STANDS AND WAS       
 FORTIFIED IN 1338 AGAINST FRENCH      
 RAIDS.IT FORMS AN IMPRESSIVE ENTRANCE 
 TO THE ABBEY FROM THE TOWN OF BATTLE. 
 THE TOWN GREW UP TO SERVE THE         
 MONASTERY.
