		<title>03The Mini Zoo in Skegness</title>
		<content> The manager of Natureland,Mr.Yeadon,  
 told us that it was first opened in   
 1965 by a Manchester Company.Later    
 they sold it to Mr.Yeadon who built   
 new buildings immediately.The first   
 animals were Californian sealions.    
 They have 60_70 different kinds of    
 fish and several other species of     
 animals such as reptiles,birds,       
 mammals and domestic animals.In 1984  
 they had a new exhibit of tropical    
 butterflies which were transported    
 as chrysalises.A change for the better
 would be bigger facilities and more   
 exhibits.Approximately 30 animals     
 are washed up a month and they are    
 mostly baby seals.The cost of         
 keeping the animals comes to Â£500     
 a month.This marine zoo is well       
 worth a visit.It is not very dear     
 to get in Natureland.
