		<title>12POLLUTION IN THE CANAL</title>
		<content>{ECOLOGY EXERIMENT1}-To determine      
 whether the canal was polluted,       
 various experiments were done.        
 Firstly, a sample of water was poured 
 into a long glass tube,which had a    
 cork in the bottom with a cross on it.
 The object was to pour water into the 
 tube until the cross was invisible. It
 took 10cm cubed and showed the water  
 was highly polluted.                  
{EXPERIMENT2}-An experiment was done to
 determine if lead was in the canal. By
 adding some Potassium Chromate, which 
 is yellow, the water should form a    
 yellow solid if lead is present. This 
 didn't happen.                        
{EXPERIMENT3}-Using Methylene Blue, we 
 could find if Oxygen was present by   
 the water turning blue. This happened 
 proving Oxygen present.               
{EXPERIMENT4}-We proved Hydrogen       
 Sulphate was present.                 </content>
