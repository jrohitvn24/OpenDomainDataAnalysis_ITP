		<content> Thatching is one of the{oldest forms  
{of roofing}and with tiles was the     
 traditional covering in this area. We 
 have{our own thatcher}in Stebbing who 
 also works in surrounding areas.He    
 uses long straw called Maris          
 rigen.This straw was used in the  war 
 and originated in France.It is grown  
 locally near Saling airport.Good      
 quality straw costs about Â£300 a      
 ton.The straw is cut with a binder    
 before it has completely ripened.It   
 takes 5 to 6 weeks to thatch an       
 average roof and the hardest part to  
 thatch is the eaves.Tools used are    
 tractors,binder,straw elevator,straw  
 and wire clippers,pitchfork,mallet and
  an eave knife.The straw is formed    
 into large tiles called yealms and    
 fixed with wooden pegs called spars or
 spindles made from nut hazel.the ridge
 is a separate patterned layer.        </content>
