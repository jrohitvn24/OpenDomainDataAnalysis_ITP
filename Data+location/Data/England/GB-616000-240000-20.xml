		<content>As these pages have revealed, this area
of Ipswich has a great variety of      
land-use.It is both urban and rural,   
growing and declining.The area is      
dominated by it's estuary of the river 
Orwell and magnificent views of the    
area around this stretch of water can  
be gained by the new bridge.           
  The great variety of scenery and the 
hussle and bussle of life in this area 
proved to be very interesting to the   
pupils at both Copleston school and    
st.Johns Primary.It is largely through 
the pupils efforts that this           
information has been gained .          
  All the typing and computer entries  
were made by three pupils at Copleston 
Tara Palmer,Lisa Adams and Zoe Forrest 
under guidance of their teacher,Mr     
Leeder.
