		<content> TOUR    The biggest tourist attraction
 is the Pagham Harbour Nature Reserve. 
 This was founded 19 years ago and is a
 home for many wild creatures.  Each   
 year there are about 50,000 visitors, 
 mostly in Spring and Autumn when birds
 are migrating.  Sidlesham does not    
 have many places where tourists can   
 stay.  There is no hotel but two or   
 three village houses offer Bed and    
 Breakfast accomodation.  There are    
 two Public houses which attract       
 visitors.In the summer they prouide   
 Bar snacks.  One "The Anchor" is on   
 the main road through the village to  
 Selsey.  The other, "The Crab and     
 Lobster" is near the harbour and      
 Nature Reserve.                       
      There are two Caravan Club       
 certificated sites in the village.    
 These can take a maximum of five      
 touring caravans.                     </content>
