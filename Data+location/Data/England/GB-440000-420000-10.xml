		<title>10Landscape of Featherstone</title>
		<content> The mining town of Featherstone with  
 its pit stack and headgear is situated
 amid the green fields of arable farms.
 We visited the village of Ackton in   
 the NW in order to have a good view of
 most of the area.Looking from Ackton  
 the landscape is more agricultural    
 than industrial except to the north   
 where huge pylons dominate the land   
 carrying electricity cables from the  
 power stations to the east.All round  
 the village the views are a pleasant  
 green because so much of the land is  
 covered with cereal crops and it is   
 June .The landscape changes with the  
 time of year and growth of crops.To   
 the SE is a grassed pit stack which   
 hides the town of Featherstone from   
 view,this is being removed to infill  
 the opencast site to the south.On it's
 eastern side the stack is bare soil.
