		<title>03DENTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village school is constructed in  
 iron stone. It has thirty children, of
 five to eleven years of age, and two  
 teachers. The children have to go to  
 Grantham to secondary school. In 1983 
 the Education Committee decided to    
 close a number of small village       
 schools as part of a policy of        
 rationalisation and cost cutting. The 
 villagers united to resist this and   
 the school won a temporary reprieve.  
 There is only one shop in the village,
 a combined general store and sub post 
 office.Most people use this once a    
 week, the main shopping being done in 
 Grantham.                             
 In a questionaire which asked amongst 
 other things "If you would like to see
 another amenity in Denton, please     
 state which", a large majority        
 answered -- a children's playing      
 field.                                </content>
