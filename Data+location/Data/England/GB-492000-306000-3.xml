		<title>03Trout Rearing Farm</title>
		<content> A Trout Rearing Farm is situated at   
 the  base of the dam at Rutland Water.
 The eggs of the trout are hatched at  
 nearby Horn Mill and come to the farm 
 when they are 13 cms long.  At the    
 farm they are put into tanks about 1.4
 metres deep.  There are thirteen tanks
 each containing approximately 8,000   
 fish progressing from one tank to     
 another as they grow.  They are fed 54
 times a day in the summer, 32 times in
 the winter.  They are fed on fish     
 pellets which provide lots of protein.
 The trout are released into the       
 reservoir when they are 30 cms long.  
 Three people work at the farm tending 
 the trout and the tanks have to be    
 cleaned out once a week.
