		<title>10THE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The village hall is called the{Victory
{Hall,}because it was built soon after 
 the end of the 2nd World War,replacing
 a wooden building.                    
 The money to build it was raised by   
{local efforts}and a grant from the{   
{Carnegie Trust.}                      
 The main{central hall has a stage,}and
 the auditorium is just big enough for 
 a badminton court.  There is a{foyer, 
{two cloakrooms, a kitchen, and storage
 below the stage and above the foyer.  
{Two extensions}have been added, the   
 full length of the hall on each side. 
 The hall is used by more than 20      
{village organisations,}and also for   
{private functions.} It provides a     
{surgery}for a visiting doctor.        
 It is run by a{committee}of local     
 people, and meets its running costs   
 from booking fees.  The committee does
 fund-raising for decoration, etc.     </content>
