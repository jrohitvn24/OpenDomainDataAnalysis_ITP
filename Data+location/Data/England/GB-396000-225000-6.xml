		<content>{Cockbury Court}is a collection of 7   
 self-catering holiday cottages set in 
 their own grounds. Originally farm    
 buildings on the  estate of nearby    
 Sudeley Castle some of them,including 
 a tithe barn, date from the 16th &amp;    
 17th centuries.                       
   More recently the hamlet of Cockbury
 was a millionaire's private retreat   
 until it was taken over for its       
 present purpose in 1976. Now the      
 proprietor,Mr.M.Blanchard,welcomes    
 guests from all over the world but    
 mainly Australia, Canada and the      
 U.S.A.                                
   There is an ornamental pond with    
 large gold-fish as well as a swimming 
 pool.The doors of the tithe barn are  
 always open during the Summer to let  
 nesting swallows and house martins fly
 in and out.
