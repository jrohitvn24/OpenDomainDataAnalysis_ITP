		<title>03RIVER AVON, STRENSHAM</title>
		<content> The{Lower Avon Navigational Trust  }  
 governs this stretch of the river and 
 its members, over the last twenty     
 years, have restored it to a busy     
 waterway by cleaning the banks,       
 restoring the locks and dredging to   
 prevent flooding.                     
                                       
 The river is used entirely for        
 recreation and in summer, a large     
 number of boats pass through the locks
 and use the permanent moorings on its 
 banks. In recent years, the{narrow}   
{boat}has become popular and many are  
 hired during the season.

{Strensham Marina,}near Defford, plays 
 host to a sailing club used by Malvern
 College and also, the Arden Sailing   
 Club. Its buildings are small and     
 functional and the Marina cannot be   
 classed as a public amenity.          </content>
