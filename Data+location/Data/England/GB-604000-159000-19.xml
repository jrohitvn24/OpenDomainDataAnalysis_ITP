		<title>19THE LAST BATTLE IN ENGLAND</title>
		<content>   In the 1830s at a time of much      
 discontent and illiteracy amongst     
 the farm workers of this area,a madman
 and religious fanatic named Thomas    
 Courtenay came from Devon.Staying with
 a farmer at Fairbrook Farm,Dunkirk, he
 rode in flamboyant clothes amongst the
 working people encouraging them to    
 rise against their misery. A          
 confrontation finally took place in   
 Bossenden Woods.A constable,one       
 Nicholas Mears, was murdered whilst   
 attempting to issue a warrant for his 
 arrest.The military were called out   
 from Canterbury.A fantastic battle was
 fought ending with a bayonet charge.  
 Courtenay and six of his men were     
 killed.                               
 Consequently the area of Dunkirk was  
 civilised by the building of a church 
 and school which stand to this day.
