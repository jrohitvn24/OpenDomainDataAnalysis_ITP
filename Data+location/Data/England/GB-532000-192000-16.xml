		<title>16GETTING AROUND IN EDMONTON</title>
		<content>                                       
 A lot of people in my area (Edmonton) 
 use the London buses for transport,   
 there are many routes and after a     
 while you learn them by heart. The    
 W.8(Wooly eight) is popular with the  
 kids from our school (Latymer).       
    Unexperienced passengers,          
 especially small ones, can get        
 trampled on just trying to get on the 
 buses.                                
    Walking is also hazardous, firstly 
 crossing the busy roads, secondly     
 dodging the people running for the    
 British Rail train to London. There   
 are Zebra and Pelican crossings to    
 facilate pedestrains but not          
 everywhere. Other people use push     
 bikes or motor bikes to get around and
 to get to school but many people use  
 the buses or just walk.
