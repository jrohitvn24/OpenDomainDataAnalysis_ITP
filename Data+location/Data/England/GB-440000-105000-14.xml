		<content> One very famous ghost is often seen in
 Dibden churchyard. It is the ghost of 
 Lady Alice Lyle who was executed by   
 the notorious Judge Jeffries. She hid 
 two young men who had escaped from the
 Battle of Sedgemoor. The two men were 
 later found sheltering in a ditch.    
 Although Lady Alice lived in Ringwood,
 she often came to stay on her son's   
 estate and regularly attended services
 at Dibden Church. She was executed in 
 Winchester. It is interesting to note 
 that the two young men were also      
 executed. Another haunting in the area
 is a horseman dressed in black riding 
 very quickly along an old Roman road. 
 Voices are often heard in Beaulieu    
 Abbey. They sing old fashioned chants 
 in the Abbey Chapel. An old lady and  
 gentleman dressed in Victorian clothes
 are seen walking back and forth across
 the road.                             </content>
