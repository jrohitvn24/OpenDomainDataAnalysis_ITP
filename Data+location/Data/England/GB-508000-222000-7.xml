		<content> On July 5th I intervieved an elderly  
 lady, this is what she told me.       
 The differences in a house of the old 
 times to a new one is gas             
 lighting,cooking by range, no front   
 doors,wooden toilets with a bucket    
 emptied every Friday by horse &amp;       
 container. She had lived in Moat Lane 
 all her life. The people in the area  
 were friendly and helpful. She could  
 show us a sewing machine 137 years    
 old.                                  
  The area has changed a great deal,   
 the Moat House used to be a field as  
 did much of the land around here. She 
 remembers a V.E. day celebration in   
 one of the fields. The changes that   
 she has made to the house include a   
 new roof, new windows, new front &amp;    
 back doors and all new gas pipes.     
                                       
                                       </content>
