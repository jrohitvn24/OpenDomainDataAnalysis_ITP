 In Fishbourne the population seems to 
 be mostly old people.                 
    A lot of people have{retired}to    
 Fishbourne which has made the houses  
 very{expensive.}This means that young 
 families cannot afford to live here,  
 so the{school numbers are falling.}I  
 don't think many children that live   
 in Fishbourne like having so many old 
 people around because if you play in  
 the road where its safe you still get 
 old people coming out to{complain.}As 
 children are leaving the area the     
 remaing children have less friends to 
 play with,and after school most       
 children don't live near enough each  
 other to play.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
