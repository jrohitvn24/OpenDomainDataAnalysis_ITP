		<content>Blakesley Church is largely a 13C      
building, much restored in Victorian   
times when the present chancel was     
built. Having such a building to look  
after involves the congregation in     
great expense and we are currently     
facing a restoration programme costing 
some 20,000 pounds which becomes more  
reasonable if a 40% grant is allocated 
by English Heritage. The Eucharist is  
our Sun. service with a congregation   
of about 30. The vicar also ministers  
to Adstone a small village 3 miles     
away. He is involved with Blakesley    
School and serves as a School Governor,
currently acting as vice-chairman. The 
children come to church for a service  
on Ascension Day and at Harvest.The    
most popular  service is the Crib      
Blessing and telling of Christmas Story
on Christmas Eve. Whole families come  
then. Midnight Mass follows later.     </content>
