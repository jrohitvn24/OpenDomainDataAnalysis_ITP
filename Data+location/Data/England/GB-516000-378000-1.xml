		<title>01PANTON A GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content>{PANTON}is a predominantly rural area  
 with 3O dwellings. 23 are occupied and
 7 are unoccupied. Seven of these are  
 farmhouses, ll of the thirty, a third,
 are not connected with agriculture as 
 a living. There are 47 adults and 23  
 children. Not one of the adults grew  
 up here as a child.  The gently       
 undulating terrain is interspersed    
 with coverts, small woods, and        
 forestry commission plantations       
 covering about 8% of the area. Narrow 
 lanes interweave the scattered houses.
 An important but not obvious feature  
 is{PANTON BECK}which rises from       
 springs and flows eventually into the 
 Witham.  In Wragby,{PANTON}is thought 
 of as being "out there". In London or 
 even in Lincoln, it is regarded as    
 being the "back of beyond" but it is  
 paradoxically seen as a very peaceful 
 rural retreat.                        </content>
