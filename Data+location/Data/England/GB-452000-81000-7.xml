 Formed in 1895 its monthly meetings   
 are open to the public who may not    
 participate except in a 10 minute     
 question time. Councillors are elected
 for 4 years, the next election being  
 in 1987. There are 6 Parish           
 Councillors and 1 Parish Clerk.       
 Godshill Parish of 5760 acres has a   
 population of 1064 people. The        
 Council, at the grass root of local   
 government, comments on local         
 planning applications and is          
 responsible for the maintenance of    
 footpaths and the provision of bus    
 shelters and litter bins. Godshill is 
 one of the few Island Parish Councils 
 operating its own cemetery which was  
 opened in 1951 as the local           
 churchyard was near capacity.
