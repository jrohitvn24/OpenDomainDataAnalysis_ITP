		<title>15BARCLAY SCHOOL STEVENAGE</title>
		<content> The school was designed by the team   
 of {Yorke, Rosenberg and Mardell.}The 
 founder of the firm{Francis Yorke,}was
 one of the pioneers in England of the 
 international modern style of         
 architecture.{The Barclay School}has  
 many features such as a swimming pool,
 beautiful buildings used for Sience,  
 Chemistry, Gym, Maths and English.    
  There are lots of visual arts        
 such as a{Mural}by Kenneth Rowntree in
 the foyer; the{William Morris}        
 wallpaper and the large bronze{'Family
{group'}sculpture by{Henry Moore.}     
  Wide corridors and ample circulation 
 areas mean that movement around the   
 building is easy, and no one has to go
 outside to get from one place to the  
 other. The age of the children is from
 12_18 and there are{910}pupils in     
 school.
