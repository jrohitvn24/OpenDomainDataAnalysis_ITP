		<title>11The Beavers.</title>
		<content> On Tuesday two cub leaders came to our
school one named Susie and the  other  
named Christine, Susie is called a     
{Grey Beaver}.The Beavers are aged 5 to
7 and they are taught things they need 
to know before they go to Cubs.In the  
past they have had observation tests   
in the  village and in the hall they   
have done tests with their senses of   
smell, sound, sight and taste. The     
Beavers often go on trails over to the 
park and study things about nature.    
They have a lot of fun.                
                                       
         {Christine.}                  
                                       
 Christine is the leader of the {Wolf  
Pack}.At cubs she is called Arkela. You
come to cubs after Beavers if you      
are between 7 to 10 you can join.They  
teach you things before you go to      
scouts.                                </content>
