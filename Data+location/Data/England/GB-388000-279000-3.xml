		<title>03EARLY POPULATION GROWTH</title>
		<content>   The balance between{baptisms and    
{burials}gives little indication of    
 population growth at this time. A     
 survey of marriage entries, first made
 compulsory in 1754, allows an         
 assessment of{literacy}to be made. In 
 1770 only 61.8% of marriage partners  
 could write their name, by 1900 this  
 had risen to 98.8%.                   
   The first accurate population       
 figures are not available until the   
{first national Census}of 1801. From   
 1801 to 1851, the parish, which then  
 included Blakedown, grew steadily from
 621 to 935. In comparison Clent rose  
 from 738 to 937 in the same period.   
   The 1838{Tithe Map}shows that in the
 early 19th century, Upper Hagley was  
 the major centre of population. The   
 Old Rectory was built at the very top 
 of Hagley Hill to allow the rector to 
 carry out his extra duties in Romsley.</content>
