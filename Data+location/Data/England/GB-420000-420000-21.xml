<title>21Dewsbury Moor Library...</title>
<content>...closed a few years ago and is now part of the Dewsbury Moor Surestart Centre. I wrote the original article 25 years ago when I was at infant school and have often wondered what happened to it. &lt;br />&lt;br />I have recently attended the building that the library was in as part of the surestart centre with my 2 year old daughter. &lt;br />&lt;br />It's really interesting to look at all this and remember.&lt;br />
