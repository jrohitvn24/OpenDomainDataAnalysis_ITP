		<content> Landford Manor is an old building     
 built around fifteen ninety nine.     
 Inside there is oak paneling and it is
 old too.Today it is used by a firm    
 making maps and plans.The office was  
 built around 1700.An extra wing was   
 added in 1900.The  building has       
 been renovated to make it better.The  
 windows are sash ones, and about once 
 every two years the water comes       
 gushing in.The vicar of St.Andrews    
 church was the nephew of Lord Nelson  
 and owned Landford Manor.At the       
 Crystal Palace there was a fire and   
 the fountain was brought back to the  
 manor.There is five and a half acres  
 of land and a pretty garden.The       
 owner of the manor, had the church    
 built next to the manor, so he        
 didnt have to go far to the           
 church.There is a stone tablet just   
 above the manor door.                 </content>
