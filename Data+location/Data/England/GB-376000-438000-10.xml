		<title>10INTERVIEW WITH WILSONS (1)</title>
		<content>{Mr and Mrs Wilson}have lived in Sabden
 all their lives which is{76}years.Yet 
 they have not lived in the same house.
 The streets they have lived on are {  
{Watt St.}and{Pendle St.West.          
 During the war they had to black out  
 the windows and have black curtains.In
 the houses all they had for light was 
 one single lamp bulb hanging from the 
 roof.At night a warden would come     
 round to make sure everything was     
 blacked out.The reason for this being 
 is that if any planes went by,they    
 would see the lights and probaly bomb 
 them.                                 
{Mr and Mrs Wilson }both had work.Mr   
 wilson was a cook for the army and Mrs
 wilson worked in a mill.People were   
 never bored because everyone was very 
 friendly and when they were working   
 everyone sang along.
