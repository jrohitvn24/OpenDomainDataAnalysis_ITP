		<title>14Employment around Brinklow</title>
		<content>{Brinklow}was once a self-contained,   
 self supporting community with many   
 craftsmen and tradesmen. Farmers      
 employed many people as did the local 
 big houses. The village dockyard no   
 longer exists but a boat hire business
 operates at{Stretton under Fosse.     
 Today Brinklow offers employment      
 through its school,shops,cafes,pubs,  
 clubs,restaurants and garages and     
 gives work to doctors,vets,postmen,   
 policeman and religious ministers.    
{Coombe Abbey}employs people for the   
 country park,cafeteria and the house  
 itself for Mediaeval Banquets. The    
 main centre of employment is the large
 industrial site of{Rolls Royce.}People
 travel from many areas to work there. 
 Most work is now outside the area in  
 Coventry or Rugby. It is sad there is 
 now a fairly high rate of             
 unemployment.                         </content>
