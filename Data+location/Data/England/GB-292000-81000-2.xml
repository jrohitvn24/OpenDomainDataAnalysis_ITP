{ }Frank Cumes came to visit class one 
 to talk to us. He was born in         
 September 1887,which means he is 98.  
 His father and grand father came to   
 our school. He started school at the  
 age of seven and left at fourteen. The
 headmaster was strict;he was fond of  
 giving "six of the best" (the cane)   
 the other teacher whose favourite     
 punishment was sticking a pencil in   
 pupils ears. There were no school     
 dinners but they had bread and sops   
 for breakfast. They had to work on    
 slates at school. All the children    
 were scared of the lunatic assylum    
 across the road. When he left school  
 he became a gardener. He worked 50    
 hours for 10 shillings(50p). He worked
 every day of the year except Good     
 Friday and Christmas Day.             </content>
