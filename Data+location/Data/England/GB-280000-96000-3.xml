 We left Landscore about 1.20pm for    
 Salmonhutch.Salmonhutch is about 2km  
 away from school.                     
  Salmonhutch consists of a bridge,the 
 River Yeo and a few cottages next to  
 the railway line.It used to be where  
 salmon hatched out _ hence the name _ 
 we think!The 8 cottages were semi_    
 detached and all had slate roofs.     
  The river was shallow at this stage  
 and fairly slow  running.This was     
 because we hadn't had much rain.We    
 went over a stile down to the river   
 edge to explore.We saw lots of        
 wildlife and wildflowers.In the river 
 we saw pond skaters,water spiders and 
 minnows.Some of the flowers           
 included cow parsley,stitchwort,garlic
 mustard as well as the usual field    
 flowers like buttercups and daisies.We
 saw a few birds- pigeons and a finch. </content>
