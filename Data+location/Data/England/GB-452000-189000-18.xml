		<content>All the chemists are open six days a   
week.  Once every three weeks one of   
the chemists stays open extra hours.   
There a quite a few newsagents in      
Didcot.  The largest is Centre News,   
which mostly sells cigarettes and      
news-papers, although it does not      
deliver papers. 12 people work there,  
most of whom are part-time.  Between   
500 and 600 people shop in Centre News 
daily.  Occasionally they have         
shop-lifters.  Another newsagent is    
P.K. Newsagents.  The two owners, who  
both work there full-time, live above  
the shop.  It is open 14 hours a day. 7
paperboys and girls deliver papers.
