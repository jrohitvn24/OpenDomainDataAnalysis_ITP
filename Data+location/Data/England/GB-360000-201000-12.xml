		<title>12The Lydney Town Youth Tattoo</title>
		<content>    On Saturday,29th.June the sixth    
 annual Lydney Youth Tattoo took place 
 in Bathurst Park. The tattoo is for   
 the youth of the district to enjoy    
 themselves, help their organisations  
 and also this year the "Save the      
 Children" fund. About twenty groups   
 took part such as Guides,A.T.C.,Judo  
 Club and Playgroups.                  
    The Tattoo began with a procession 
 through the town and on to the Park.  
    After the opening by the Mayor     
 there was a Mini Olympics with races  
 for all ages including wheelbarrow and
 chariot racing. This was followed by a
 knock out soccer competition and a    
 display by the Judo Club.             
    Whilst this was going on people    
 were able to go around the large      
 number of stalls arranged around the  
 ground with things to sell and compete
 for. It was very enjoyable afternoon. </content>
