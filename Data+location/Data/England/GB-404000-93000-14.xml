		<content> My name is Thomas Stone and I live in 
 the North West corner of Bournemouth. 
 My friend Mary Lucas lives across the 
 road from me, in Poole. One fine sunny
 day we decided to go for a trek around
 the area. We headed for Turbary       
 Common, about ten minutes walk away.  
 On the way we passed our two schools, 
 Oakmead Girls and Oakmead Boys. In    
 September 1985 they are to be combined
 into one co-ed school. We also passed 
 a fast growing industrial area called 
 Roundways containing, at the moment,  
 about thirty units. We then proceeded 
 across the Common to the Wallisdown   
 Road. This is the main road into      
 Bournemouth from the South West. It is
 also part of the border between       
 Bournemouth and Poole. Having crossed 
 this busy road we very soon find      
 ourselves in a green belt again.
