		<content> In this rectangle there is a small    
 factory. It is situated on the road   
 B1055 to Hempstead. This factory makes
 wood chippings to be used for horse   
 riding training in many surrounding   
 stables. The men who cut down the     
 trees bring the trunks to this        
 factory. There the bark is stripped   
 off and cut into chippings. Some of   
 the chippings are large and some are  
 small. Several men work at this       
 factory. The chippings are then       
 delivered to the stables. Sometimes   
 the chippings are used for bedding the
 horses and other animals. Mainly they 
 are used in the manage for training   
 purposes. Sarah Greene at the local   
 riding stable uses these chippngs.
