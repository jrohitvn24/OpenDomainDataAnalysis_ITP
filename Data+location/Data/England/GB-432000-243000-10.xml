		<title>10FARMING - TYSOE - GENERAL</title>
		<content> In the 1980s farmers are facing       
 problems of surpluses. Even in this   
 rural community it is having its      
 effect. Milk Quotas imposed by the EEC
 are causing problems particularly for 
 smaller farms.                        
 Land for sale tends to be bought      
 by neighbouring farms. The house and  
 buildings of one farm sold in 1985 is 
 being kept to develop the Bed and     
 Breakfast trade which has increased   
 greatly this decade.                  
 Very little labour is employed on the 
 fifteen farms in the area, they mainly
 depend on family labour. About half   
 the area is covered by the few larger 
 units which are mainly arable, but    
 these are on the periphery of the     
 village. The farms closer to the      
 village tend to be mainly grass,      
 stocking beef and sheep, five of them 
 having a dairy herd as well.          </content>
