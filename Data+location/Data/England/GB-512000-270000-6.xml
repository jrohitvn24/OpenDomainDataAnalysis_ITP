 In all the villages surrounding       
 Spaldwick there were very  small      
 schools,but as the population grew,it 
 was decided that they would close ,and
 a new school would be built.          
 .A primary school was built in        
 Spaldwick,and the children from       
 seven villages attend.The school,when 
 it was built,had only three classrooms
 though now it has four and new        
 buildings are being added.There is a  
 large playground on which the children
 can play,and a field with a football  
 pitch. When children are at secondary 
 school age,they are sent to           
 Hinchingbrooke ,a large comprehensive 
 school in Huntingdon,approximately    
 seven miles away.As most children live
 outside our village,transport is      
 provided to and from Spaldwick.
