		<title>14A visit to Mrs Hodges</title>
		<content> Mrs Hodges is in her 80s. She used to 
 knit for the Stonehenge Knitting Co.  
 She stopped because it was very poorly
 paid. The firm wanted the items       
 knitted so quickly she had no time for
 her family. She was knitting special  
 jumpers for the relief work in        
 Ethiopia. They were of a special      
 pattern with short sleeves and a      
 longer than normal body. This is      
 because the starving children also    
 need protection from the extremely    
 cold nights they have to endure. To   
 date she has knitted 32 jumpers for   
 Oxfam. She still knits complicated    
 patterns on Arran design jumpers for  
 friends and relations. She learnt to  
 knit using two sticks and a bit of    
 string. At school she was always in   
 demand in knitting lessons because she
 was the only one who could pick up the
 dropped stitches.                     </content>
