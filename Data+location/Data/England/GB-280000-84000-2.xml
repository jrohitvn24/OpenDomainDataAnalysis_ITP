		<content> Christow School celebrated its        
 centenary in 1980 although a school   
 existed before 1880 on another site in
 the village.                          
                                       
 The first headteacher was Miss White  
 who was the head for 40 years.  After 
 Miss White there have only been 6     
 other headteachers they are:  Mr      
 Stacey, Mr Parsons, Mr Alderdice and  
 Mr Rigby.  All were heads for several 
 years except Mr Rigby - he found it   
 necessary to resign owing to ill      
 health in May 1985 after only 4       
 years.  Our new headteacher from      
 September is Mr Graham.
