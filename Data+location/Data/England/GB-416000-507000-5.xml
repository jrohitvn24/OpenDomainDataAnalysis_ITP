 volume  of each members pair of leeks 
 and assesses their condition, shape &amp; 
 quality and then places them in order 
 of  merit  for  prize winning.  Onion 
 pairs are similarly judged and placed 
 in  order  of  merit. {Every  entrant 
 receives  either{a  prize  or voucher

 draws. {All the leeks and onions must
