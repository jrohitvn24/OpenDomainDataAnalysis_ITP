		<content> I'm Laura, l4, &amp; I live with my dad   
 (he(s divorced).  Last Saturday, dad  
 rose at 8.00am. After washing, he fed 
 Joey (our cat), ate breakfast, and    
 went for a bike ride.  Meanwhile, I   
 stayed in bed gazing at my posters of 
 'Wham &amp; 'Frankie'. At 9.30 I dragged  
 myself downstairs and watched the     
 'Saturday Morning Picture Show'in the 
 kitchen.  I took the TV to the sitting
 room and ate breakfast (muesli,       
 wholemeal toast &amp; coffee.) After a    
 shower I dressed and we left for      
 Gosforth at l0.50 arriving at my dad's
 girlfriends 20 minutes later. We took 
 the Metro to Newcastle after coffee.  
 We bought groceries at the Green      
 Market, had a snack at the Antiques   
 Supermarket, and returned to Coral's  
 at 2.30. After dinner, we returned    
 home where we found Joey miaowing its 
 head off.                             </content>
