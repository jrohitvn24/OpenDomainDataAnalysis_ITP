		<title>10STRETTON SWIMMING POOL</title>
		<content>    The{Swimming Pool}is built on the  
 School field and the children from the
 schools use it during the day.        
    The Church Stretton{Swimming Pool  
 was opened on the 26th of June 1971 by
 Jasper More, MP for South Shropshire. 
 The cost to build it was Â£19,000. This
 money was raised by the people of     
 Church Stretton. Before it was a      
 Swimming pool it was a work-house. The
 old buildings were converted to       
 changing rooms.  Local clubs can      
 hire the pool, when the schools are   
 not using it, for Â£8 per hour.        
    There is a{Swimming Club}which runs
 sessions nearly every evening. There  
 are courses for beginners, improvers, 
 synchro, diving, life saving and      
 canoeing.                             
    Admission costs 50p for adults (75p
 for non-members) and 25p for children 
 (35p for non-members) for 1 hour.     </content>
