		<content> Swindon grew up as a railway town when
 Brunel chose it as the centre for the 
 Great Western Railway, locomotive,    
 carriage building and repair workshops
 in 1841. The town became dependant on 
 these workshops as the main source of 
 employment. In recent years,with the  
 decline of the railways, the town has 
 set out to attract a variety of firms 
 to give it a broader industrial base. 
 The new industrial estates and office 
 blocks have changed the skyline.Many  
 people have come to liveand work      
 here,helping it to become one of      
 Europe's fastest expanding towns in   
 the 1980's. It has pleasant chalk     
 downs to the south and a lowlying clay
 vale to the north, a thriving soccer  
 club, new sports complexes, and a good
 shopping centre.
