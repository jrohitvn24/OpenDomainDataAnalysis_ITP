		<title>20WOOLROW FARM</title>
		<content> Mr Hall has been at this farm for     
 twenty five years.The main crop is    
 grass.From his cows he gets 350       
 gallons a day of milk.He also sells   
 potatoes.They make little money with  
 eggs as they eat most themselves.     
 There are twelve hens and two or three
 cocks.The house was built in the      
 twelfth century, but a stone on one   
 side is dated 1718.It used to be      
 called The Wolf Trap and the name has 
 changed through the years to Woolrow. 
 The farm has seven acres of woodland  
 and 90 acres of grassland; root crops 
 are grown in 10 acres,there are five  
 acres of swedes and 2 acres of kale.  
 They start working on the farm at 7   
 o'clock in the morning.
