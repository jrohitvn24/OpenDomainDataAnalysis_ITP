		<title>04HALFWAY BRIDGE, LODSWORTH</title>
		<content>{Travellers : slow down &amp; don't blink! 
   The new line of the{A272}by-passes  
 this hamlet on the  west bank  of the 
 River  Lod   between   Petworth   and 
 Midhurst.   A dozen dwellings with an 
 old mill,  a  former  coaching   Inn, 
 a modern factory  assembling  display 
 panels and a police office are missed 
 by the traveller who speeds by.       
   We walked  with Mrs Enticknap  along
 the  old road  as  she  described  the
 buildings and paths up to Lodsworth.It
 was fun playing Pooh-sticks on the old
 bridge but the most exciting place was
 the cellar of the old Inn:it was dark,
 smelly and spooky.  Mr &amp; Mrs Greenwood
 invited us in to see the former stable
 now a  games  room, the  low ceilinged
 bars and the deep cellar.{BAR PRICES:}
