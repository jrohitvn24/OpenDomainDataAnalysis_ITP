		<title>20Transport Survey Bourne End</title>
		<content>  As both interviewees commented on the
 amount and noise of traffic in the    
 village we decided to do a survey for 
 1 hour from 2 p.m. on a mid week after
 -noon,a time we thought might not be  
 too busy.This is what we found.       
{A.41}    north bound  south bound     
 Cars       485           500          
 Lorries    115            75          
 Coaches      2             3          
 Vans        86            84          
 Motor bikes 19            11          
{RAILWAY}                              
 Pass.trains  6             5          
 Goods trains 2             1          
{CONCLUSION}                           
 As this was an off peak period we felt
 that living near the road would be    
 very noisy and dangerous at busy times
 We also visited the A.41 when it was  
 raining and we got covered with mud   
 and water from the lorries.           </content>
