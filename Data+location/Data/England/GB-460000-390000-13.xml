		<content> We did a survey to find out about the 
 numbers of people living in each house
 and also about the different types of 
 houses in our village.Most people     
 lived in families of four or five     
 people.17 of the children(30%) had    
 four people in their house and 16     
 (28%) had five people.Just three      
 children(5%) lived with only two      
 people in their house whilst at the   
 other end of the scale 1 child had 8  
 people living at his house.           
 Most children(58%) lived im semi      
 detached houses whilst 19% lived in   
 terraced houses.A few children lived  
 in caravans at the Plumtree caravan   
 site and a few lived in detached      
 houses.Most people liked living in our
 village.Of the children we asked 39   
 said they did and 13 said they did    
 not.
