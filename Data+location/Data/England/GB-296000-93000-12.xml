{ENGLAND PRIMARY SCHOOL}               
 The oldest building in the school is  
 the class for the older ones.It was   
 opened in 1872 and now has 25 pupils  
 aged 7 to 11.The wooden classroom was 
 opened in 1969.It has 22 infant       
 pupils. We have a school field in     
 which there are climbing frames.In it 
 there is a little bar and a big       
 bar.The big bar is usually used by the
 older ones. The little bar is played  
 on by everyone.School starts at       
 9.00.a.m. and ends at 3.30.p.m.There  
 used to be three classes  but a       
 teacher left as the number of pupils  
 fell. Every year we go for a trip with
 the school.Each Thursday we have a    
 C.O.S.S.day with two other schools,   
 when we travel to one of the three    
 schools and work together for the day.
