		<content>      There is evidence of Romans and  
 Vikings in Sidlesham . A small Roman  
 villa was discovered here but was     
 later covered up again . The greatest 
 change came to the village in 1935    
 when the Land Settlement Association  
 was set up.                           
      This gave small areas of land and
 houses to unemployed coal miners from 
 Wales and County Durham. These men had
 to learn how to produce food on their 
 Land and were promised a market for   
 it.                                   
     They brought their wives and      
 children with them it meant that the  
 village school had to be enlarged and 
 the population grew.                  
       In 1983 the L.S.A. finished and 
 the tenants were allowed to buy their 
 holdings. Many are extending their    
 crops and producing melons, peppers,  
 flowers and aubergines.               </content>
