		<title>12St Mary's Church</title>
		<content>   The present church (Vicar,{Reverend 
{M.Brotherton)}was designed in 1889 by 
 Bloomfield. Two earlier churches had  
 existed on the site. Notable features 
 include 8 bells in a 150 foot tower, a
 heavy brass lectern in the shape of an
 eagle, a statue of the Virgin Mary and
 baby Jesus and a marble font with     
 carved biblical scenes.               
  {Isambard Kingdom Brunel}and{Charles 
{Dickens}were baptised here. A bomb    
 shattered all the stained glass in the
 east window in World War II, except   
 for the window of Christ. About 400   
 people attend services. The needs of  
 scouts, guides, the deaf, old people  
 and battered wives are catered for.   
 Once, two boys got stuck in the under 
 floor heating system but were         
 eventually rescued. This vast church  
 could have been{Portsmouth Cathedral.
