		<title>14A DAY AT MR.SMITHS FARMS</title>
		<content> My day begins at 6.00am.First I have a
 cup of tea.Then start work by putting 
 cake in the manger for the            
 cows,putting the milk equipment       
 together,and fetching the cows from   
 the field.From 6.45 to 8.00am we milk 
 the cows.After breakfast(8.30am)I take
 the cows back to the field,clean out  
 the milking sheds and equipment,feed  
 the heifer,bull and calves and put    
 straw down.At 10.30am I have coffee   
 and then do either field work or      
 maintanance work.After dinner more    
 field work is done.Then we fetch some 
 grass to the yard for the cows.At     
 about 4.30pm we wash out the bulk tank
 often the milk has been collected.At  
 5.30pm milking begins again and the   
 shed cleaned up.I finish work about   
 7.30-8.00pm.
