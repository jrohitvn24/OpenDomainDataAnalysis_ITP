		<title>13BUSHY PARK, HAMPTON WICK</title>
		<content>{Bushy Park }is a royal  park  that    
 has been given to the people.  It is  
 part of the grounds of Hampton Court  
 Palace.  In{Bushy Park}there are lots 
 of different types of animals.  There 
 are four hundred deer in the Park,    
 two hundred fallow deer and two       
 hundred red deer.  The number of deer 
 in the park is controlled by a cull,  
 it has been worked out that four      
 hundred deer is the right number for  
 the size of the park and the amount of
 food there.  There are several lakes  
 where people can go fishing.  People  
 are not allowed to go fishing without 
 a fishing permit.  Two park keepers   
 look after the park with thirty Park  
 Police Constables.
