		<title>09Waltham Choral Society.</title>
		<content>   Waltham Choral Society has existed  
 for twenty-two years.It was originally
 the Methodist Church Choir until  Mrs.
 Evelyn Harper,the first conductor     
 changed it to Waltham Choral Society. 
   There have been four conductors     
 since. There were twenty members but  
 now there are sixty. They used to meet
 at the old school room down Mill View.
 They now meet in the Church Hall, from
 7.30 until 9.00 P.M.                  
   When the Society perform the men    
 wear a dinner suit and the women wear 
 a white blouse and a black skirt,     
 soloists may wear a different coloured
 blouse.During the past ten years they 
 have become more ambitious in their   
 choice of music, the last piece being 
 "Judas Maccabaeus" by Handel.They are 
 invited to perform at different places
 in the county and have been asked to  
 sing at the opening of a new church.  </content>
