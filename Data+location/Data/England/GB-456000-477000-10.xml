		<title>10Ampleforth College farm.</title>
		<content>  Almost all the land from Shallowdale 
 down beyond Little Holbeck stream is  
 owned by the college farm. The land is
 quite fertile and usually produces a  
 good harvest. Dairy cows are the only 
 livestock kept: these provide milk    
 and yoghurt for Ampleforth College.   
 The farm grows wheat, barley, oil seed
 rape and silage which is used as      
 winter fodder. The farm has three cuts
 of silage per year plus one cut of hay
 from the rugby pitches. The farming in
 the valley is generally rather hard   
 because of the heavy soil which needs 
 drainage. In the valley there is a    
 purpose built Ice-Rink drained from   
 the crop fields. This is commonly     
 known as the 'flooded field'. The farm
 has modern machinery using New Holland
 Combines because of their reliability 
 and local suppliers.
