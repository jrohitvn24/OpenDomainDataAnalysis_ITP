		<title>18Rosscarrock Farm</title>
		<content>  Rosscarrok farm is between Port Isaac
 and Port Quin.It is a beef and cereal 
 farm.It has been there for a very long
 time and was mentioned in the original
 Domesday Book.In the 13th century it  
 was a monastery and some of the old   
 buidings are still there as well as a 
 monks walk and an old holy well.The   
 old barns are made of stone and       
 granite with slate  rooves,some with  
 pidgeon roosts.They are not used any  
 more as they are not suitable for     
 modern farming methods.The new        
 buildings are made from metal,wood    
 asbestos concrete,corugated iron.They 
 are used to store hay and for cattle  
 in the winter.They are very open so   
 that modern machinery can be stored in
 them.The grain is stored in big metal 
 bins called silos.There are 4 holding 
 60 tons of grain and 1 holding 90     
 tons.                                 </content>
