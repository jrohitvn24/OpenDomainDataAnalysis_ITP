		<title>15Eccleshall Arts and Crafts</title>
		<content> Partly because of its proximity to the
{Potteries}and Stoke-on-Trent College  
 of Art, Eccleshall provides homes for 
 a steady proportion of people assoc-  
 iated with art - either in the        
 ceramics industry or in fine art. Most
 famous of these is{Arnold Machin OBE, 
{RA,}designer of the Queen's portrait  
 used on definitive stamps from 1967,  
 and on decimal coins from 1968 to     
 1984. Others find this peaceful area  
 ideal for quiet working on sculpture  
 and painting. In the home the trad-   
 ition of needlework flourishes, part- 
 icularly tapestry, embroidery,        
 knitting, dressmaking and upholstery; 
 also marquetry, woodcarving and toy-  
 -making. Local classes are held in    
 many of these crafts, as well as in   
 flower arranging - seen at its best in
 weekly adornment of the church,       
 weddings, festivals, and annual show. </content>
