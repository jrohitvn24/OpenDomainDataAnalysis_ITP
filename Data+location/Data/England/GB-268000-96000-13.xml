		<title>13THE POST OFFICE AND SHOP.</title>
		<content>   Many years ago,Spreyton used to have
 several shops,but now we have just one
 shop and we are very lucky because not
 many small villages are able to have  
 shops these days.                     
   The shop used to be a               
 cobbler's,where people could buy shoes
 and take old ones to be mended.The    
 Post Office used to be opposite but it
 is now someone's home.There also used 
 to be a bakery,a cycle repair shop,a  
 butchers,smithy and a cider           
 factory.Jean and David Underhill,who  
 run the shop have been the shopkeepers
 for three years and live in a house   
 joined to it.Jean runs the shop       
 because she enjoys the children coming
 in to see her.                        
   In the shop she sells               
 greengrocery,groceries,sweets,crisps,d
 rinks,some toys and also newspapers to
 people who order them.                </content>
