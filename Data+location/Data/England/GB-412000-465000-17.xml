		<title>17Nidderdale Angling club</title>
		<content> Nidderdale Angling club is responsible
 for stocking the river Nidd with brown
 trout, and some rainbow trout, four   
 times a year. They also trim the trees
 along the river bank during the       
 winter, to make the casting of fishing
 lines easier. The trout fishing season
 starts on April 1st and ends on       
 September 30th. However, anglers can  
 still fish for grayling after that    
 date. The river has trout, grayling,  
 minnows and eels in its waters. Fly   
 fishing and bait fishing are allowed. 
 From July to September, minnows are   
 allowed as bait, as they are very     
 affective. The fee for local adults is
 Â£16 and for juniors it is Â£7. For     
 adults who live outside the dale, it  
 costs Â£29 and Â£14 for the juniors. At 
 least 2500 fish are caught each year. 
 The heaviest fish caught in recent    
 years weighed 3lb 14oz.               </content>
