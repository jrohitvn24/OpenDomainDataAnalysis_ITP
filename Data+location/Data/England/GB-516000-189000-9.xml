		<content> BELMONT HEALTH CENTRE, KENTON LANE    
                                       
    This Health Centre was opened in   
 September 1979 to replace another     
 which closed in Wealdstone. It was    
 built on the site of an old railway   
 station. A community centre is planned
 next door, partly on the car park.    
    The building is designed to make   
 access easy for the disabled and      
 people with prams and pushchairs.     
    It houses 2 group practices with 8 
 General Practitioners in all. Open    
 hours are 0830-1830. Appointments are 
 necessary.                            
    The centre also contains baby      
 clinics, hearing-test facilities, a   
 chiropody and a dental practice.      
    A "dial-a-ride" scheme operates to 
 carry patients to the centre. A small 
 charge is made for this service.
