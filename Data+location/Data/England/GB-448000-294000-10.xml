		<content> In our survey of the two villages we  
 were able to find out that most of    
 both villages have had houses built in
 the last thirty years.Both villages   
 have an ancient centre of stone       
 cottages as well as quarryworkers     
 19th century brick cottages.In the    
 1920s and the 1930s there was some    
 building though not a great deal.After
 the second world war there was  some  
 local authority housing of            
 aspproximately 50 to 60 houses in each
 village.However most houses were built
 in the 1960s and the 1970s.These      
 houses vary in size and type.Many of  
 the new homes are detached            
 properties.There are about an         
 equal number of semi's and terraced   
 homes.The majority ,about 80          
 percent,are owned by the people who   
 live in them.There are about 600 homes
 in Croft and 900 in Stoney Stanton .  </content>
