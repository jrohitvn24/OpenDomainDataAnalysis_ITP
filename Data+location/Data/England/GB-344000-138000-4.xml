		<content>  For the Ashcott Peat Works.          
   In 1969, the Somerset River         
 Authority recognised that there were  
 possibilities for the worked_out peat 
 areas.                                
   They could be used for land drainage
 , water storage and{recreation.       
 Proposals were prepared  for          
 the future use of the peat moors. This
 is known as the Avalon Lakes Scheme.  
 This would involve the{flooding}of the
{peat}moors which only have enough     
 reserves to last for approximately 27 
 years.                                
   There will be a series of{lakes}    
 of                                    
 different sizes. This plan and others 
 for the after use of the moors are    
 currently being examined in the course
 of preparing the subject local plan   
 for peat.
