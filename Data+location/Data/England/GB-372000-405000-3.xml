		<content>   Many Farnworth churches have        
 Rose Queens. The Rose Queen is a girl 
 usually aged between 9 and 16. She    
 wears a long dress and a train. She is
 usually crowned in May or June. She   
 has young girls as train bearers and  
 ladies in waiting. She might have boys
 as cushion bearer and sword bearers.  
   At St. John's the retiring Queen    
 leads a procession through the streets
 behind a band and followed by her     
 retinue. People collect money which   
 goes to the Rose Queen fund and the   
 church.                               
   The Rose Queen attends some special 
 church services in her regalia. Each  
 Rose Queen visits about twenty other  
 churches during her reign to compete  
 against other Rose Queens. They are   
 judged for appearance and personality.
 Cups or shields are presented to the  
 winners.                              </content>
