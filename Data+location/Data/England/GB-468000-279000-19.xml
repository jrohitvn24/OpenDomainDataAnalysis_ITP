		<content>      Children in Class 5, at Clipston 
School decided to set up a weather     
station and record the weather for     
the month of June 1985.                
  A data collection sheet was devised  
and information was collected and      
recorded every day at approximately    
1:30.  When all the information was    
available the children drew bar charts 
and line graphs to represent their     
findings.                              
                                       
The average rainfall in 24 hrs was     
4.75mm.                                
The average temperature throughout the 
month was 18 degrees Centigrade.       
The prevailing winds blew from the E or
NE.                                    
The average wind speed was 3 mph.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
