		<title>09HAYDON BRIDGE HIGH SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school serves one of the largest  
 catchment areas in England, 600       
 sq.miles, total population 10,000. The
 School's roots go back to{1685}when   
 Rev.John{Shaftoe}signed a Trust Deed  
 to found a Free Grammar School in     
 Haydon Bridge. In 1985 we have 710    
 pupils, incl. from Sept.90 boarders.  
 This year about 30 pupils will take   
 Degrees &amp; 99% of pupils aged 16+ took 
 public exams. The School has a{farm}of
 74 hectares. Some 400 pupils study    
 Agriculture or Horticulture as part of
 their education. Outdoor activities   
 are a feature. In 1982 the Under 15   
 Cricket XI was 2nd. in the Lord's     
 Taverners Cup out of 2000 entries.    
 Former pupils have run for England.   
 With respect, we think that our School
 is the special feature of our Domesday
 block.
