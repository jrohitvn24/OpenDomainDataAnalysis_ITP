		<content>{OUR SCHOOL by Class 2 }               
  We go to Hartshorne Primary (Church  
 of England) School. There are 76      
 children in the school, and three     
 classes, but there used to be four. We
 have{two}teachers in our class. We    
 start each day with assembly where we 
 sing hymns, listen to stories and pray
 to God. We do projects which can be   
 talking about things back in the very 
 olden days. We get house points if we 
 do our work well. At lunch time we can
 do gymnastics, football, netball,     
 choir, recorder or computer club. In  
 the summer we have Area Sports.       
 Sometimes we go on trips to places;   
 this year we went to Weston Park, and 
 we regularly go to the Field Study    
 Centre. A group of us went to         
 Hartington Youth Hostel with the      
 teachers for a weekend. Every year we 
 have our photographs taken.           </content>
