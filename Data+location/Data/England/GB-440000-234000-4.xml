		<title>04 The Rules of Skipping</title>
		<content>                                       
First you get a long piece of rope then
go to an open space out side.You need  
three or more people to play, you need 
two people holding the ends of the     
rope.Then they turn the rope around and
around then some one stands in the     
middle and when the rope comes down you
jump over it. You  can sing tunes to   
the speed of the rope and you can go   
fast or slow you can have  competition 
to see who can go the fastest and who  
can go the slowest and you can see who 
can do the most.These are some games   
i know how to play. You skip once and  
then you run out then you count four   
then run in  do one skip then run out  
again and you keep doing this for  as  
long as you want. Another game you can 
play is where you see how many people  
can be jumping at the same time in the 
rope.We've done 39 jumps altogether.   </content>
