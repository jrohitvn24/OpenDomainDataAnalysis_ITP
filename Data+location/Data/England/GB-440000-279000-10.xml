		<title>10Changes in Brinklow</title>
		<content> Miss Denyer's family has lived in the 
 village for over 100 years.She likes  
 living in Brinklow because she likes  
 the countryside and it's not too far  
 to town.She thinks Brinklow is a      
 friendly village but not as friendly  
 as when she was little.Miss Denyer    
 went to Brinklow School and still     
 visits it.She finds shopping is not   
 difficult in Brinklow but goes to near
 by towns to shop for clothes.She      
 thinks that some of the modern houses 
 spoil Brinklow but doesn't mind the   
 changes because she says "You get used
 to them",but she wouldn't like the    
 village to get too big.She remembers  
 the time when the trains stopped at   
 Brinklow Station to take school       
 children to Rugby but of course the   
 station is now closed.
