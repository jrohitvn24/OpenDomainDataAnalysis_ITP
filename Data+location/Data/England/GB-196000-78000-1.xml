		<content>   Port Isaac is a very small and      
 pretty village on the north coast of  
 Cornwall surrounded by mixed          
 farmland.It has a harbour at the      
 bottom of the village where most of   
 the fishing trips go out from.The only
 trouble with Port Isaac is that the   
 hedges are so tall and overgrown that 
 when you drive along in your car you  
 cannot see the beautiful views of the 
 coastline.There is not a lot of public
 transport and you cannot get into Port
 Isaac or Port Gaverne by train,but    
 there is a garage calledProuts and    
 that does trips to Truro and places   
 like that.Our nearest big town is     
 Truro about 30 miles away and our     
 centre is Wadebridge, a small market  
 town 9 miles away.The nearest railway 
 station is Bodmin Parkway 18 miles    
 away.
