		<title>03BRILL WINDMILL,BRICKS,TRAM.</title>
		<content>Brill in the 1086 Domesday Book was    
called Brunhelle.Brill has a windmill  
on the common which was built in 1680. 
It stopped functioning in 1915 but is  
still open to the public on Sundays.   
Brill also had some brickworks below   
the windmill.There were 7 kilns on the 
common.All but one closed down before  
the First World War.This was run by    
William White and lasted for two years 
longer.The Brill tram ran 7 miles from 
Tram Hill to Quainton on a single      
track and worked from 1872 to 1935.A   
1339 law protected the forest red,     
fallow and roe deer.The only other     
animal was the wild boar.Only a small  
area of the forest now remains.In 1964 
there was a great train robbery.The    
thieves hid on Letherslade farm and    
they stole 2,000,000 pounds.Early this 
century there were 26 shops:bakers,    
butchers,toy,general stores;now only 5.</content>
