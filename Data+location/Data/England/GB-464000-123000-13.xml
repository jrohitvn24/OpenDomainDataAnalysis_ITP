		<content>    Mothers often join together to     
 organise entertainment for children,  
 sometimes combining it with fund      
 raising. In this way the Village Hall 
 is often used for discos and          
 celebrations such as Hallowe'en and   
 Guy Fawkes evenings, to which all are 
 welcome.                              
   The former village policeman uses   
 the local Lions' mini-bus to take     
 children to Alton to swim on Friday   
 evenings.                             
   A local care group, to which anyone 
 may belong, attempts to meet any call 
 for help within the community,        
 particularly with transport. Examples 
 of those helped are those who wish to 
 visit relations in hospital or to keep
 hospital appointments.                
   The account of someone very much    
 involved in the community follows.
