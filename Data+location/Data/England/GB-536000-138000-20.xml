		<title>20A Typical Day in My Life</title>
		<content> I wake up at 6:30 a.m.and get up at   
 7:10.I wash and get dressed then I go 
 downstairs.We start breakfast at 7:30 
 and our whole family has it together. 
 My brother Gary comes in from his     
 paper-round before we have breakfast  
 and our dog Meg comes to greet me.Then
 I walk to school.                     
 School starts at 9:00 a.m.and finishes
 at 3:30 p.m. In the morning we have   
 assembly, then maths and, after break,
 English.Between 12:00 and 1:15 p.m. is
 lunch time.After lunch I play in the  
 playground until the whistle goes.In  
 the afternoon we have geography,      
 history or art.I go home and change   
 and if it is Monday or Thursday I go  
 to dancing classes or other-wise I    
 make things or read.At 5:30 p.m. I    
 have tea with the rest of my family.  
 Later I watch television. At 9:00 p.m.
 I go to bed.                          </content>
