{Chalfont Football Club} was formed in 
1926.It is sponsored by Highlight      
Windows. One evening we had a game     
against Watford to raise money for a   
local policeman who was badly          
wounded in a bomb blast.The club is    
also hoping to have another charity    
match against Q.P.R..The players are   
part-time professionals and come from  
all walks of life.                     
                                       
{Chalfont Cricket Club}                
Chalfont Park C.C. is situated         
next to Gerrards Cross Golf Club,      
which is on the A.413. It has a very   
good pitch and the pavilion has a bar  
in it. The club has a practice every   
Sunday for its various youth teams.
