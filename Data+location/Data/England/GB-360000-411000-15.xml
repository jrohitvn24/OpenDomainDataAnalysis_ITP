		<title>15THE GREAT HOUSE BARN</title>
		<content>    The visitor centre for the         
 Rivington Country Park is housed in   
 another notable landmark of the       
 area.This is Great House Barn,so      
 called because of the farm            
 nearby.However it is of particular    
 interest because the huge beams inside
 form a cruck structure which hints at 
 he Anglo-Saxon origin of the barn.    
    Visitors to the Country Park may   
 well gaze up at these as they tour the
 exhibition at the centre or drink a   
 cup of tea in the cafe area.          
    This is now the nerve centre of the
 Park.Information is available and a   
 clear indication of how the space is  
 to be used.One can fly model          
 aeroplanes in one section but only    
 walk quietly in another.Probably Lever
 would have approved the sense of      
 ordered enjoyment and the great old   
 beams now seem safe for years.        </content>
