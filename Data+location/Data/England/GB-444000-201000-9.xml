		<title>09Farm Cottages-Eaton,Henwood</title>
		<content>     Two {Victorian}style cottages once
 tied  to  Bradley's farm have recently
 been  extended  in  the same red brick
 and retaining the original style.     
     In  Wootton the cottages belonging
 to Manor Farm were sold years ago when
 the  land  was  sold.  Recently Myrtyl
 Cottage  has  been bought as a{weekend
{home} and  Tommy's  Farm, which  is no
 longer a farm house is being renovated
 at enormous expense as a family home. 
     In Eaton several houses were built
 for  farm  workers  in  1865 but today
 only  two  are  still  tied to a farm.
 One  came into private ownership in an
 unusual  way.  The farm worker who was
 the  tenant was dismissed for stealing
 and   evicted.   When   the  case  was
 investigated  he was declared innocent
 but  he refused to be re-instated.  As
 compensation  he was given the cottage
 in which he had been a tenant.        </content>
