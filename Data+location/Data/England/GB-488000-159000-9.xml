		<title>09OLD DEAN ESTATE.</title>
		<content> After the Second World War military   
 affiliations of the residents of      
 Camberley diluted.Expansion was more  
 rapid with a London overspill estate  
 in 1950s (light industry providing    
 employment grew up on the other side  
 of Camberley).Later the completion of 
 the M3 brought more commuters and the 
 older houses were redeveloped as cul- 
 de-sacs and new housing estates were  
 built.                                
 The council overspill estate known as 
 the Old Dean immediately established  
 a bad reputation with the traditional 
 Camberley residents.The naming of the 
 roads after areas where residents had 
 previously lived(eg.Mitcham &amp; Wimble- 
 don Roads) did not make them all feel 
 at home.Schools expanded rapidly and  
 a community developed.30 years later  
 the reputation lingers but private    
 owners now are moving onto the estate.</content>
