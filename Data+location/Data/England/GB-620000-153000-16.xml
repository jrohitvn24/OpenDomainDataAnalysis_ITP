		<title>16Home and Living in Adisham</title>
		<content>  Life at Adisham centres very strongly
on the home. The women do their own    
housework, cooking and looking after   
children. Some of the married women    
combine these activities with a job.   
The modern houses have refrigerators,  
washing machines, and some deep        
freezes.  Many older properties also   
have modern conveniences.  All         
properties have main drainage and      
indoor bathrooms, with one exception,  
a rented cottage with only an outside  
toilet.  Cooking is by gas or electric 
stoves or Aga solid fuel cookers, but  
gas services do not extend to the ham- 
lets. Many people do their own decora- 
ting and house renovations. Most homes 
have pets ranging from a cat and dog   
to various animals.  These include     
tropical fish, ponies, horses, donkeys,
goats, and birds such as budgerigars,  
cockatoos,canaries, ducks and fowls.   </content>
