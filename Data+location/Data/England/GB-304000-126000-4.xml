		<content>    The Stevens family live at Marshes 
 Farm, Chipstable.The farmland is steep
 and very hilly. The farm is a beef and
 sheep farm. The Stevens family own 180
 acres. The kind of sheep they own are 
 Exmoor Horn ewes and Suffolk and      
 Hampshire Down rams.                  
    Breeding is done by putting the    
 Exmoor Horn ewe with the Suffolk ram. 
 They keep all the ewe lambs and then, 
 when they are old enough,they put them
 with the Hampshire Down ram and then  
 sell the lambs. They have 250 ewes and
 50 hogs (young lambs). They lamb their
 ewes in February in sheep sheds, and  
 when the lambs are strong enough they 
 go outside.                           
    The Stevens also own beef cattle,  
 and they have one milking cow which   
 provides their own milk. Mr Stevens   
 milks his cow by hand.
