		<content>   The village of Preston has spread   
 out from the church of St.Andrew near 
 to the A353 road. A row of old        
 cottages still stands adjacent to the 
 church but much more noticeable are   
 the modern houses built during the    
 last two years.                       
   The village school is also near the 
 church as are the few local shops.    
  Apart from the church the oldest part
 of the village is around the Bridge   
 Inn. The bridge is one over the River 
 Jordan. The Village mill was near here
 and traces can still be seen of the   
 mill pond and race.                   
  The river can be followed to the sea 
 at Bowleaze Cove. On either side of   
 the river are caravan sites. It has   
 been said that there are more caravans
 in Preston than anywhere else in      
 Britain.
