		<content>   Bridgerule Primary School Today     
    The primary school is situated in  
 the middle of the village in a        
 delightful setting backing onto       
 farmland. Although old the school is  
 in remarkably good condition having   
 had an extension comprising indoor    
 toilets and an extra classroom built  
 in 1957.                              
    The organisation is based on a     
 staffing level of Headteacher plus    
 1.1 assistant teachers. At present the
 infants (4+-7years) are taught in one 
 room and the juniors (7+-11years) are 
 taught in the other main classroom    
 which doubles as a dining room. Midday
 meals are no longer cooked on the     
 premises but are sent by road from    
 Holsworthy Primary 6 miles away. The  
 school has its own tiny outdoor       
 swimming pool but unfortunately no    
 adequate playing field.N.O.R.approx.30</content>
