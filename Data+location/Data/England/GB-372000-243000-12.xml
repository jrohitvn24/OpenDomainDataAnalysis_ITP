		<title>12HOP FARMING IN MATHON.</title>
		<content>   In January,February,March and April 
 it is quite quiet on the farm.In May  
 the men start spraying the hops and   
 corn.Also lots of people are employed 
 to string and to do bracing,which is  
 putting strings from the wires to a   
 peg in the ground.In June the mechanic
 starts work on the hop machine,which  
 takes the hops off the stalk (bine).  
 Then in September the corn is         
 harvested and the hops are taken from 
 the field.A special harvester called a
 bine cutter,which cuts the bottom and 
 a tractor and trailer comes along with
 people on who get the hops down onto  
 the trailer from the wires.After they 
 have been through the machine they go 
 to be dried and put into hop pockets. 
 Next they are taken to a brewery.From 
 October to December it is quite quiet 
 as well.
