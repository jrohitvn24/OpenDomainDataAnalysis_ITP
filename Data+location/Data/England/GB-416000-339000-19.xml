		<title>19A VILLAGE'S LIFE AND FUTURE</title>
		<content> Nowadays a village like Yeaveley      
 cannot offer employment to all its    
 residents. The ambitions of town      
 people to move to villages force      
 property prices to rise. These two    
 factors result in youngsters with     
 roots in the village moving away to   
 find jobs and cheaper places to live. 
 This means an increasing need for     
 those who care about the village to   
 play an active part to ensure that it 
 retains its identity and institutions 
 and does not simply become a dormitory
 area. The incomers from the towns have
 much to learn from their new          
 neighbours, but those born in the     
 village must also be prepared to      
 recognise the need for change. Time   
 and development do not pass villages  
 by and only by being alert to change  
 can their residents ensure that their 
 destiny and character are maintained. </content>
