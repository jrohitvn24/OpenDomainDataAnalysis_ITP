		<title>11Unemployment in Somerton</title>

 Leffman's is an established factory in
 Somerton which has employed local     
 people for more than twenty years. It 
 manufactures foundation garments for  
 leading stores like Marks and Spencer 
 and Debenhams.Because there is not    
 enough work for all the factories he  
 owns Mr Leffman is closing his factory
 in Somerton and concentrating the work
 at Bristol and Bridgwater.My Mum has  
 been given ninety days notice and     
 everyone who works there has to be out
 by September 6th 1985.My Mum hopes    
 that it will be taken over by someone 
 else. If not she says I will have less
 pocket money each week.It would make  
 a lovely Sports Centre with a swimming
 pool out in the back field.
