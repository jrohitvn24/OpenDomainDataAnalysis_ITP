		<content>The next stage is to put the baby      
oysters into larger tanks and feed     
them.They feed on microscopic plants   
called algae. The algae is also grown  
at the farm in a very wet and hot room 
which we were also shown. The tanks of 
algae are bright green. As the oysters 
feed on the algae they grow quite      
quickly and the tanks are sealed       
carefully to prevent the oysters       
escaping.The final stage is in an out  
of doors oyster bed before they are    
sold.They are now about 4 mm.long.Most 
of them are sold abroad to such        
countries as,South Africa,Italy,Denmark
and France, where they are placed in   
special sea beds until ready to eat.The
oyster farm was built at Reculver      
because there is plenty of sea water,  
it pumped from the sea into a system of
pipes which keeps it fresh.
