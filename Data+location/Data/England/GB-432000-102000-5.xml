		<content> We went to{Hawkhill and Stockley      
{Inclosures}for the day. The car park  
 has lots of little open areas         
 separated by trees. We went for a walk
 to the railway. There are many        
 footpaths, some wider tracks and some 
 gravel roads. These make natural      
 breaks in the woodland for{fire       
{prevention.}We saw other people       
 walking and some cyclists. We saw a   
 man in a pony and trap.               
 When we had finished our walk we had  
 some hamburgers cooked on a gaz burner
 in the picnic area or car park. While 
 we were out on our walk somebody tried
 to open the boot of my grandfather's  
 car but they did not manage it. You   
 have to make sure you{lock your car   
 and do not leave anything valuable in 
 it when you are in the Forest.
