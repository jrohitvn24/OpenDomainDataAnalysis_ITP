		<content>   Byrkley Park used to have a large   
{Hall}on the land, when it was owned by
{William Bass,}but it was demolished   
 many years ago.                       
   Where I live used to be the{laundry 
 and across our yard is what used to be
 a{school}for the workers children.    
   My next door neighbour lives in what
 used to be the{stables.}              
   When you go down the drive and over 
 a cattle grid there's a{lake.}It has  
 got a lot of fish in it.              
   I like taking our dog for walks with
 my Dad. Sometimes I help him feed the 
 stock.                                
   It is nice where I live. I like it a
 lot. It is about a mile from the main 
 road and is surrounded by fields. In  
 the Spring these fields are full of   
 pheasants.
