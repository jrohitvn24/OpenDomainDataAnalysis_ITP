  From the 41 households who replied to
 our survey of occupations, we found   
 that over two thirds had professional 
 or managerial jobs. Although the area 
 is predominantly rural, only one fifth
 of the respondants worked on the land.
 Occupations included 6 company        
 directors, 5 teachers, a radiographer,
 a solicitor, a gamekeeper, a timber   
 merchant, an educational psychologist,
 7 people who work on the land and many
 other varied occupations.             
 The largest local employer is Hillers 
 at Dunnington Heath Farm. They employ 
 12 men and 15 women full time and at  
 the height of the fruit picking season
 this number rises to 70 men and 95    
 women.
