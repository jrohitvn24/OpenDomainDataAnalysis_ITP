		<title>18BUSES AND TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>   In Mylor,alot of people commented   
 that the buses should be more         
 frequent.The buses come every other   
 hour 9.30/11.30                       
   There is only one bus stop in Mylor 
 but there was no bus stop sign.(The   
 buses had not changed much over the   
 past years).Alot of people in Mylor   
 have their own car so the bus is not  
 used too often.The bus is a double    
 decker.A survey was taken to see how  
 many vehicles went through the main   
 street in 15 minutes.The              
 results were as follows Cars=21       
 lorries=2 and buses 1.The car is the  
 most common vehicle in Mylor.Most     
 people used the buses either once a   
 week or very rarely.Only a few people 
 used the bus regulary because they did
 not have any other means of transport.
