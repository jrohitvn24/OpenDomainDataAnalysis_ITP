		<title>06GUIDE DOG CENTRE,BOLTON</title>
		<content>   In our area there is a guide dog    
 centre called Nuffield House on       
 Lowndes Street Bolton.It was opened by
 Princes Alexandra.There are now six   
 guide dog centres.The breeding centre 
 where the guide dogs are born is in   
 Warwickshire.At six weeks old they are
 sent to the guide dog centre in Bolton
 where they stay for the night and then
 given to puppy walkers until they are 
 one year old and then they are given  
 back to the centre to be trained as   
 guide dogs.The dogs are trained       
 initially in the grounds of the       
 centre,then in streets around the     
 centre and finally in the busy town   
 centre.There are approximately 30 dogs
 in each block and there are four      
 blocks.It takes eight months to train 
 a dog and costs about Â£2000.When the  
 dogs are ready the blind people come  
 to stay at the centre.                </content>
