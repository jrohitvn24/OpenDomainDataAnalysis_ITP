		<content>{ The area is one of the highest in    
{this region}with Beacon Hill, in the  
 south east of our area rising to 145M.
  Wickersley cross roads has a spot    
 height of 138M.The road drops quite   
 quickly from these areas in all       
 directions.                           
{ The area is basically split into a   
{60_40 ratio of farmland to            
{residential,}with more being built in 
 the present and near future.          
     There is very little in the area  
 in respect of playing fields and parks
 and this causes pressure on the area. 
    There are several old age peoples  
 homes and sheltered accomodation in   
 the Bramley and Flanderwell area.     
    Wickersley has previously won the  
 village competition showing that{the  
{local population has a pride in their 
{area.                                 
                                       </content>
