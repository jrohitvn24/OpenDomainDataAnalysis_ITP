		<content> The{Derby Ramathon}is a marathon road 
 race that takes place each year. It is
 named after the nickname of Derby     
 County, the Rams. The race is 26.2    
 miles although many runners settle for
 the half marathon. It is essentially a
 fun run and although many trained     
 athletes take part, most competitors  
{run for fun}being sponsored by their  
 friends for charity. Crowds line the  
 streets and cheer all the runners     
 regardless of their position in the   
 race. This is something fairly new to 
 Britain, a phenomenon of the eighties 
 imported from America and now held in 
 most cities and towns in this country.
 The amazing thing about the runners is
 the wide spread of ages from teenagers
 to men and women in their seventies.  
 The marathon syndrome has coincided   
 with a national awareness of the      
 importance of{physical fitness.}      </content>
