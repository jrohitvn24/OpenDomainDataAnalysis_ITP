		<title>17Siren, Martock fire station</title>
		<content>     A few months ago Martock Fire     
 Station's siren was taken out of use  
 leaving people living near the fire   
 station in Manor Road unaware of      
 rushing cars and fire engines.  The   
 change was made when each fireman was 
 issued with a personal alarm          
 bleeper, but a new siren is now in    
 use, as a result of local pressure.   
 Nearly all the fire stations lost     
 their sirens; Martock, however,       
 decided to fight for theirs.  Before  
 the siren was reintroduced, workers   
 from Burfield's glove factory had to  
 get out of the way very quickly       
 because they didn't know when cars    
 would rush down Manor Road carrying   
 firemen.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
