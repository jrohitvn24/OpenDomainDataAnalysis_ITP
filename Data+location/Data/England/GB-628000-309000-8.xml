		<title>08THE WORK OF A LOCAL BUILDER</title>
		<content> We asked a local builder about his    
 work.he has been building for 32 years
 .He builds houses on ex-farm land and 
 enjoys what he does,sometimes it is   
 hard to get building permission. He   
 starts work at 8am. and finishes in   
 the summer at 5.30pm. In the winter he
 may finish earlier if the weather is  
 bad. He is{self employed}and has a    
 certain amount of land to build on.   
 He uses laminates, wood, concrete and 
 plastic as well as brick. The{bricks  
 come from the London brick company and
 are Fletton, Ibstock and thermolite   
 blocks. Ladders, carpentry tools,     
 power drills and scaffolding are part 
 of his{equipment.}He likes the houses 
 built at present. In Thorpe End the   
 new houses blend in with the others.  
 Sometimes{conservationists}affect his 
 work. He thinks there will be more    
 building in the area in the future.   </content>
