		<title>19FOOD CHOICES IN PORTCHESTER</title>
		<content> We asked some children in our school  
 some questions on food.  The most     
 popular meal was fish and chips.  A   
 lot of children said they ate large   
 amounts of food.  The least popular   
 foods were vegetables and liver.  Most
 people ate cereal for breakfast, had  
 three meals, with sandwiches for lunch
 and their main meal at teatime.  One  
 little girl liked sugar sandwiches.   
 We asked parents some questions on    
 food.  One of the questions was " What
 would you have if you went out for a  
 meal?"  The most popular answer was   
 steak and chips.  The least popular   
 food was liver, kidneys and snails.   
 Most parents have two meals a day.    
 Parents mostly have meat or salad. A  
 lot of parents were not fussy about   
 their food.  Every parent liked       
 foreign food apart from one.
