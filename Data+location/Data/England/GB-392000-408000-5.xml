		<content> Many new houses have been built in the
 area around Crompton Buckstones C.P.  
 School in recent years.The children in
 Class 3 decided to find out how many  
 of their parents and grandparents had 
 actually been born in Shaw and the    
 reasons why people had decided to move
 house.They sent out questionnaires to 
 all the families with children in     
 school and interviewed some of the    
 parents and grandparents.             
{                                      
{The Questionnaire}                    
                                       
 We found out that most people were    
 born outside Shaw.Some of the people  
 were born overseas in places like     
 France,India and Africa.              
 Most people have lived in Shaw less   
 than 10 years.It is mainly            
 grandparents who have lived in Shaw   
 more than 20 years.                   </content>
