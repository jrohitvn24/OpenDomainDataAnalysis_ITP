		<title>13The Pottery.</title>
		<content> The Mill Pottery is situated on the   
 outskirts of Wooton Courtenay. In     
 Domesday Book a mill is mentioned at  
 the same place. The last person to use
 it as a mill was a milleress. When Mr.
 Gaitskell moved in, on October 4th    
 1974, it was a run-down farm Mr.      
 Gaitskell is mostly self-taught but   
 is very skilled at his work. He       
 produces a selection of stone-ware    
 ranging from egg-cups to bread bins.  
 Most of his items are for house-hold  
 use but some are decorative. He makes 
 glazes called Chun, Temmoku and       
 Dolomite.Since he came Mr. Gaitskell  
 has installed a fibreglass, 9 foot    
 water-wheel which produces 5          
 horsepower. He hopes to drive the     
 clay-mixer, ballmill and pugmill on   
 water power. He's hoping that in the  
 future when people come, they will be 
 able to see the whole process.        </content>
