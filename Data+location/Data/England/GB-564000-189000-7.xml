		<content>  The landscape of the area is         
undulating. On the steepest slopes,    
south of the village of Little Burstead
the land is given over to rough pasture
  The major part of the flatter land is
used for arable farming of cereal crops
of wheat and barley. Field size is     
relatively small due to the A127 to the
south and the steeper slopes to the    
north.                                 
  A strip of land running from north   
east to south east is divided up into  
smallholdings, some specialising in    
market gardening, some in small scale  
"orchard" fruit production such as     
apples. The remainder are given over to
family houses with large gardens.
