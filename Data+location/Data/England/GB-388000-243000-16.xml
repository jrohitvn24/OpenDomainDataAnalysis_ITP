		<title>16BESFORD VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{Besford}is the only other settlement  
 of any size in the block. It is a     
 hamlet of approx.{16}houses and farms 
 with a population of approx.{50.      
 It is centred on the church of{St.    
{Peter, Home Farm and Church Farm.     
 There is also a large Manor House to  
 the north of the church surrounded by 
 a curious serpentine wall.            
 The village dates from before the{14th
{century}although present housing stock
 is varied. On the road north out of   
 the village is a block of five local  
 authority houses.                     
 Many of the houses are surrounded by  
 small holdings some specialising in   
 deep litter hens.                     
 There is one road in and out of the   
 village and the local children attend 
 the nearby{Defford village school.
