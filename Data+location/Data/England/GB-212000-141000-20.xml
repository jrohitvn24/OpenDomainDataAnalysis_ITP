		<title>20Lundy's Past.</title>
		<content> The Lundy Granite Company was set up  
 in 1863-and there were various other  
 attempts to exploit the island's      
 resources.When he died in 1883        
 his son William Hudson Heaven took    
 over.His ambition was to build a new  
 church and this he achieved-though at 
 considerable expense to the family    
 fortunes.On his death in 1916 it      
 passed to his nephew Walter Heaven but
 he sold the island 2 years later.     
 In 1925 Martin Coles Harman bought the
 island.He defended the islands        
 independence fiercely-expelling the   
 G.P.O.and issuing his own coins.He was
 interested in wildlife and started    
 the Lundy Field Society.On his death  
 in 1954 his son Albion Harman took    
 over Lundy but when he died in 1968   
 his two sisters put the island on the 
 market. (see p.16).
