		<title>14DRY STONE WALLS.</title>
		<content>   The whole of our area is            
 criss-crossed with walls. They form   
 intricate patterns across the         
 countryside, casting velvety lines of 
 shadow. They have to be built to      
 withstand the very harsh wintry       
 weather of the region. They then form 
 a protection for the crops against    
 strong winds and drifting snow.       
   The walls in our area are made of a 
 variety of types of stone.            
 The shape of the wall depends upon the
 stone used.                           
   There are many animals that live in 
 the walls, like spiders, mice and     
 insects. Even birds nest there        
 because the walls shelter them from   
 the wind and rain.                    
   The walls are maintained by the     
 farmers or by young people on         
 conservation projects.
