 at 7.30am.before she catches her train
 to work.She is a trainee supervisor at
 British Home Stores in Birmingham.My  
 brother,my dad and I have breakfast at
 8.00am.After breakfast,I do the house-
 work and my brother tidies his bedroom
 At 10.30am.we go for a bicycle ride.  
 When we return my dad reads,Matthew   
 plays on the computer and I watch     
 television.At 1.30pm.my dad cooks     
 lunch.We usually have 'Sosmix',mash   
 and peas.(Sosmix is a substitute for  
 meat,we are vegetarians).After dinner 
 my dad washes up and then we all have 
 jobs to do.Matthew and I wash the car 
 and dad chops some sticks.At about    
 7.15pm.my mum comes home.Then we fetch
 some chips from Dordon fish and chip  
 shop.After we have eaten them,we go to
 bed.
