		<title>11Radio Station</title>
		<content> There is a British Telecom Radio      
 station.  We were told it covered 730 
 acres and is between 263 and 325 feet 
 above sea level.  There are 154 radio 
 masts and 4 were knocked down in 1984.
 They are called log periodic aerials. 
 They carry 10 million million         
 volts.  Men are on duty 24 hours a    
 day.  They work 3 eight hour shifts.  
 The radio station is too expensive to 
 run so it will have to be closed down 
 but not knocked down.
