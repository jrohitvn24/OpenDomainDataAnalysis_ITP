		<content>{Oswin Grove}was built twenty one years
 ago. It was built to provide living   
 accommodation for{elderly people}from 
 Gilling and surrounding farms and     
 villages .There is one large building 
 containing twenty-seven flats. Four of
 the flats are for couples and the rest
 are for one person. There are also    
 eight semi-detached bungalows to house
 couples who can manage for themselves.
 Inside the buildings there are some   
 special{'intercoms'}through which the 
 old people can talk to or summon help 
 from the{warden.                      
  The Richmond branch of the W.R.V.S   
 provide a{'meals on wheels'}service   
 twice a week.                         
  This is a popular area for people to 
 move to on{retirement,} hence there   
 is  a  large  proportion  of {senior  
{citizens}in the village.
