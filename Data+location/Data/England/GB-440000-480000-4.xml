 When we have lunch, we have metal     
 trays to eat off, which reminds me of 
 prison. We go to the canteen, choose  
 what we want and sit down to eat it.  
 My favourite lesson is Drama. I like  
 acting, and at my old school we did a 
 good play where I had a main part.    
{Home Life:}When I go home I fling off 
 my uniform and put on my tatty jeans  
 and T-shirt. I have a guinea-pig      
 called Flash. He is brown and white   
 and runs as fast as anything. He      
 lives in a cage in our back yard. His 
 cage has 2 compartments- one for      
 sleeping and one for eating. He is    
 getting fat though, so I am putting   
 him on a diet. After tea, I do my     
 homework, watch T.V. or go out with my
 friends. My favourite T.V. programmes 
 are cartoons. Then it is time to get  
 ready for bed.   {Carl Foster}        </content>
