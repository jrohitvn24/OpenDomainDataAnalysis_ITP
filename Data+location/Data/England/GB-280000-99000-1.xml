		<title>01Description of the Block</title>
		<content>     This D Block contains the greater 
 part of{Crediton}and a large area of  
 surrounding countryside. Through it   
 from east to west runs the main road  
{(A377)}from Exeter to Barnstaple.     
 Other roads are for the most part     
 narrow lanes. In the south-east corner
 of the Block there is a{railway}line, 
 running from Exeter to Barnstaple. The
{land}around Crediton is very good both
 for growing crops and pasturing       
 animals. The southern edge of the     
 Block runs through the{Yeo valley.}   
 This is very picturesque but will     
 be spoilt if a decision is made to    
 build a Crediton{by-pass}through      
 it.                                   
     The{population}is largely         
 concentrated in Crediton, with        
 approximately 6,000 people. Outside of
 the town there are only a few         
 scattered houses and farmsteads.      </content>
