		<title>13SOCIAL SURVEY</title>
		<content>To find the views on life in the area  
a questionnaire was compiled.          
Of all those interviewed 67% liked     
living in the area.When asked why they 
they liked living in the area so much  
they all stated that they liked the    
quiet and beautiful surroundings.      
However 33% interviewed(all were under 
16) said they disliked living in the   
area because there was nothing to do in
their spare time,except watching T.V.  
There was a local youth club but they  
were not too enthusiastic about its    
activities.                            
65% over 16 years said they had their  
own transport(cars).Those without cars 
(45%) thought that the local bus       
service was very poor ,with only one   
bus service to Longton a day.They said 
they would use a more frequent service 
if there was a wider choice of         
destination.                           </content>
