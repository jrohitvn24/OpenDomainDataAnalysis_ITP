My name is Victoria Salt and I am 11   
years old. I am a resident of Draycott 
village. Draycott is a small,          
close-knit village. It has 2 pubs, a   
church, a post office, a grocery shop, 
a spots centre and a school.           
                                       
In the summer holidays the only thing  
in Draycott which children can do is to
go to the sports centre, if you are a  
member or if you have a friend who will
take you as a guest. I think Draycott  
could improve by having more activities
for children and some social club for  
adults.                                
                                       
I am quite satisfied living in Draycott
and I wouldn't want to move.
