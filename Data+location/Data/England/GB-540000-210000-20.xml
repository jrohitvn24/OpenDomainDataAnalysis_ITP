		<content> play football.  I am in the school    
 team and I also play for a Sunday team
 called KC Dynamos.                    
 After school I sometimes play         
 badminton at the local playbarn, and  
 round my area I play cricket and      
 tennis. I can swim and I have a       
 certificate for swimming 150 metres.  
 Next year I shall be a 4th year and   
 then I shall go on to Comprehensive   
 School.  When I leave I want to be a  
 lorry driver like my dad working round
 London.                               
 I don't watch much television because 
 I would rather be out playing. We've  
 got a caravan and we often go to a    
 caravan site near Cambridge.  This    
 year we are going to take it to the   
 Isle of Wight."
