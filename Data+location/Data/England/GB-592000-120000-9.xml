		<title>09Tourists in Rye</title>
		<content>  We went to Rye to do a survey on the 
 tourists there. The people that we    
 surveyed mostly came from other parts 
 of England and a lot of people came   
 because of the historical town. All   
 the people we surveyed found the town 
 interesting and most of them would    
 come again. Most of the people liked  
 the town and the old buildings and    
 quite a few liked the cobbled streets.
 We enjoyed finding out what other     
 people thought of Rye. Rye Parish     
 Church is very poular with the        
 tourists. In 1984, 540,000 people     
 signed the visitors' book and they    
 represented 135 different countries.
