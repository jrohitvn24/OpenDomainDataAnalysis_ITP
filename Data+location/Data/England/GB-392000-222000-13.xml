		<content>{MY BEDROOM}is at the very top of the  
 house. While it was being re-plast-   
 ered I had to sleep in the basement. I
 have a big wardrobe with lots of      
 skirts,T-shirts, party dresses, jeans 
 and some dresses for playing in the   
 garden. I have a lot of ornaments, my 
 favourite is a china thimble. I have a
 box of books and a desk. I keep my    
 toys in a cupboard. When I am in my   
 room I sometimes listen to music. I   
 have a tape player, record player and 
 radio all in one.
