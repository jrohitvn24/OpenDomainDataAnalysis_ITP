		<title>04FARMING IN LAUGHTON</title>
		<content> In Laughton there are several farms.  
 Some are concerned mainly with        
 livestock, whilst others concentrate  
 on growing crops. Here is some        
 information about two farms.          
 On the farm where Miles lives, there  
 are two hundred and fifty acres. The  
 only crop grown is barley. The main   
 concern of the farm is livestock;     
 there are cattle, calves, sheep, pigs 
 and horses. The animals are fed on    
 hay, silage, barley and calf pellets. 
 On Simon's farm there are five hundred
 and ten acres given over to the       
 rearing of cattle and sheep. When they
 are ready, the animals are sent to    
 market at either Hailsham or          
 Heathfield.                           
 When Simon and Miles grow up, they    
 want to be farmers.
