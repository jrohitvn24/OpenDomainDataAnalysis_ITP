		<content> An attractive feature of the village  
 is the memorial gardens,which were    
 layed out in 1948 on the centenary of 
 Crittall's works and in memory of     
 Francis Crittall and his wife. Old    
 people love to walk in the park and it
 is delightful in spring with the trees
 in full blossom.Children enjoy having 
 freedom to play games and to potter   
 around the bridge and pond,although   
 tree climbing is forbidden.Unhappily a
 minority of people dump rubbish in the
 pond and the toilets are closed due to
 vandalism and graffiti.Our school     
 children try to look after our lovely 
 park.Most houses have big gardens and 
 allotments are popular.The hotel and  
 Western Arms offer facilities for a   
 night out.The school also arranges    
 family social events,such as,fetes,   
 dances and barbecues.
