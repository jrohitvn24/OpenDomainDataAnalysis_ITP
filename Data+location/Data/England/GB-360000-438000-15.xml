		<title>15Industry in Knowle Green</title>
		<content> Mini-prints at Knowle Green was       
 founded ten years ago by its two      
 directors who found themselves made   
 redundant in the economic recession.  
 They bought an old Bobbin Mill of some
 antiquity, situated on the banks of a 
 fast-flowing stream and since then,   
 modern administration offices have    
 been built.                           
                                       
 The firm specialises in the reduction 
 of photographs used, for example, in  
 the advertising of houses by estate   
 agents and now has subsidiary         
 companies in Canada and South Africa  
 and has recently opened laboratories  
 in Darlington.   Mini-prints employ   
 some 60 people, mostly local whom it  
 transports to and from work due to the
 lack of suitable buses and it has 4 or
 5 teenaged persons on the Youth       
 Training Scheme.                      </content>
