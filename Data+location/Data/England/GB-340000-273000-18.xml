 Downton for 15 years. He started      
 farming in 1964 but he didn't own the 
 estate then. It was given to him by   
 his grandfather because his father had
 been killed in World War 2. His       
 grandfather had inherited the estate  
 in 1947. Mr.Lennox originally lived in
 Downton Castle but sold it in 1977 and
 moved to the pools farm.

 barrister for 30 years and a judge for
 the 15 years he only wears his        
 ermine and scarlet robes for the state
 opening of Parliament. Nobody else  in
 his family is a Lord but his brother  
 was Sir Rupert Cross before he died.
