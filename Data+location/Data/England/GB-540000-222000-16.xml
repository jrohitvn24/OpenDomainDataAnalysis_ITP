 More recently a lorry driver on a 
routine run through [REDACTED] 
fell asleep at the wheel and smashed 
into the side of [REDACTED]. The driver was 
killed but his passenger (also asleep)
survived. 
Since then people in the area claim 
to have seen the drivers ghost walking
down the middle of the road at night. 
The damage done to [REDACTED] was soon 
repaired and it can no longer be 
detected. 
A rock band who used [REDACTED] for 
practicing claim to have seen the 
hanged man's ghost.
