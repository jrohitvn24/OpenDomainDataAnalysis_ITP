		<title>02FOX HUNTING IN WARWICKSHIRE</title>
		<content>                                       
 The horses were standing impatiently  
 in front of the manor eagerly waiting 
 to follow the hounds across the fields
 and hills.The hounds were barking     
 excitedly to chase and then kill the  
 poor fox.The riders were wearing      
 blazing red jackets,white shirts,black
 ties,black riding hats,fawn coloured  
 trousers and riding boots.They were   
 talking to each other when a long     
 brass horn blew and then they were    
 off.First the hounds went then the    
 horses and riders.First a trot and    
 then a canter. Then they disappeared  
 up the hills.Five minutes later we    
 could see them,the hounds mingling    
 with the horses then they went over a 
 hill and were out of sight.           
  Many of the people I have spoken to  
 disagree with fox hunting as a sport.
