		<content> The{Golden Link}is a club for retired 
 people, meetings are held in the      
 Community Centre on Thursday          
 afternoons.                           
 The{Community Centre}is the hub of    
 most village activities and has its   
 own management committee, built in    
 1980 for a cost of Â£56,000. This      
 summer an extra room was built, called
 the "Upton" room after a generous     
 donation from a committee member of   
 that name. The cost of this room was  
 Â£5,800.                               
 The village is well served by a       
 magazine called{ASHLINK}in which the  
 clubs, businesses etc advertise and   
 report on their affairs.              
{Ashill Village Aid}have recently      
 opened a{Community Call-in}serving    
 lunches, teas etc. and provide help to
 the villagers with any problems       
 including transport, chiropody etc.   </content>
