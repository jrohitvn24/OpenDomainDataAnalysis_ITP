		<content>}   Compton Acres started soon after   
 the First World War when the late     
 Thomas William Simpson had the idea of
 laying out some wonderful gardens. It 
 took five years of dedicated planing  
 and the expenditure of about Â£220,000 
 before the gardens evolved. Rare      
 plants, many tropical and sub-tropical
 and a priceless collection of bronze  
 and marble statuary, lead figures and 
 vases, many of them museum pieces,    
 were collected from all over the      
 world. The Japanese Garden is reputed 
 to be the only completely genuine     
 Japanese Garden in Europe. Japanese   
 architects and workmen were brought   
 over to England to construct this     
 Garden. Equally delightful are the    
 Italian Garden, Rock and Water        
 Gardens,
