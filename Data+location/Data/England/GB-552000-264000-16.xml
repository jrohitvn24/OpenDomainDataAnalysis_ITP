		<content> Rabbits, common rats, woodmice, field 
 and bank voles are plentiful. Hares,  
 moles, bats, stoats and weasels are   
 regularly seen. Although foxes        
 breed in the area they are more       
 often heard than seen. Their          
 deprivations make poultry keeping     
 an uncertain pastime. They are more   
 likely to be found in Swaffham Poor's 
 Fen and along the Swaffham Lode.      
  Occasional sightings are made of     
 hedgehogs, roe deer, and possibly     
 muntjac. Otters and badgers do not    
 occur.                                
 Myxamatosis in the rabbit population  
 is still common, but sufficient       
 numbers are now viable to justify the 
 attentions of a rabbit clearance      
 group.
