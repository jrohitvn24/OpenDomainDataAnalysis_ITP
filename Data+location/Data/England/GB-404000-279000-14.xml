		<title>14Sports Hooligans, Cotteridge</title>
		<content>We interviewed local people to discover
their views about{football hooliganism}
Mr Edmunds thinks more active steps    
should be taken {to detect the trouble 
makers} and Mr Middleton suggested that
hooligans should have {twenty strokes} 
of the {cane.} Mr Purcell said that    
following violent incidents the {club} 
should be {closed for three months} and
Mr Johnson would like to see the       
return of {public flogging.} Mrs Pagett
thinks that hooligans should be made   
to {repair the damage} they caused and 
they should {visit hospitals}to see the
injured. In extreme cases they should  
have {the birch} and be {banned} from  
other matches. Mrs Rowe would not like 
to see the erection of{electric fences}
because they could endanger innocent   
people and Mrs Revell thinks {identity 
cards} should be introduced.
