 leisure activities in Yeovil for young
 people,but there are still some       
 facilities we would like here.        
  Here in Yeovil we have an indoor     
 heated swimming pool which costs 35p  
 for children and 65p for adults,, to  
 enter.It also has three different     
 height diving boards.                 
  In the town near the centre there is 
 a cinema,which has three viewing rooms
 in it.Number one is the biggest where 
 the most popular film is shown.       
  There are a large number of Youth    
 Clubs run for teenagers in different  
 areas of Yeovil,which usually meet    
 once or twice a week.                 
  There are also several sporting      
 activities and clubs open to young
