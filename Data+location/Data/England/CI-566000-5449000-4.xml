		<title>04THE WATER PROBLEM</title>
		<content>    With a population of over 75,000 in
 the winter and considerably more in   
 the summer, consumption of water      
 within the Island continues to        
 increase. Hotels have been upgraded to
 include bathrooms in each room and    
 living standards demand a much higher 
 use of water.                         
    Water is supplied within the Island
 by a variety of means. Many people    
 have their own supply from boreholes  
 and wells. Water from the mains       
 comes from a number of reservoirs and,
 during very dry years, from a         
 desalination plant.                   
   It may seem that Jersey does not    
 have a water problem and during many  
 years when rainfall is high and       
 summers cool there is none.....       
 but.... when summers are hot and dry  
 there is a short fall in supply.
