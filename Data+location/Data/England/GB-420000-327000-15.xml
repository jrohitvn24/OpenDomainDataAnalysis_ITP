		<title>15Tutbury general info [con`t]</title>
		<content>Many years ago there were ten or more  
tennis courts,three howckey teams,a    
netball team and cricket and soccert   
teams.Now there is only a cricket team 
left.Tutbury is not a market town      
anymore.It has become popular and busy 
and also something of a tourist        
attraction so it is pleasing to hear   
news of a by-pass for the village in   
1987.                                  
THE CASTLE                             
Overlooking the village are the ruins  
of a Norman Castle which is over 800   
years old.It is a tourist attraction   
because it is associated with famous   
people of the past like Mary Queen of  
but today it is also used for camping, 
fetes, carnivals and mock battles.     
the curator has found many items of    
historical interest including cannon   
balls and bones and there are rumoured 
to be ghosts, such as a white lady.    </content>
