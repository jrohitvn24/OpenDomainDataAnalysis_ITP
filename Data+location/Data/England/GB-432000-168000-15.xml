		<title>15Industry in Hungerford.</title>
		<content>   Over 300 people have lost their     
 jobs in Hungerford over the last 3    
 years as several businesses have gone 
 bankrupt or consolidated elsewhere.   
 Two examples are Davidsons, plastic   
 bottle suppliers and Rank Hovis Mc    
 Dougall who produced animal feeds.    
 There are now several vacant sites    
 around the town and a group of local  
 people are trying to attract new small
 industry by advertising using a video 
 film of the town.However there are    
 some light industries still operating 
 successfully including Digital,Saxon  
 Industries Loheat, Hungerford Framers,
 Oakes Brothers.A new small industry   
 is Albear Ltd. which opened in 1981.  
 They employ 12 people and make and    
 design exhibition stands.These are    
 used at Olympia and Earl's Court and  
 go to several European countries.
