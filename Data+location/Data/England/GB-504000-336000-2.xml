		<title>02LANDSCAPE OF NEWTON BLOCK.</title>
		<content> The oolitic limestone rises here from 
 the wide coastal plain and is drained 
 by streams which rise at springs where
 clay is exposed at a limestone edge.  
 The land folds gently,rising from     
 under 20m in E to more than 60m in W. 
 Few buildings can be seen as villages 
 and farms are tucked into folds and   
 dips and are well-screened by trees.  
 The fields are large and mainly arable
 though adjacent to villages there is  
 often grassland.In parts the aspect is
 prairie-like but around Newton village
 hedges do mark the individual fields  
 and woodland and coppices lie amid the
 arable land.The broach spire of Aunsby
 church can be seen from many places   
 and from the highest point Boston     
 Stump which is 17 miles away.
