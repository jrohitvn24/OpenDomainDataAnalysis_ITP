 After breakfast I went to school.     
 After assembly Mrs.Tuck taught us     
 singing.We went out to play at half   
 past ten then we practised our play,  
 The Turtle Drum.I said two lines and  
 sang.We ate our sandwiches in the     
 class and then I played on the        
 computer.I did my flower arrangement  
 for the Fayre and some divisions.We   
 packed up and went home.{Gavin aged 9
