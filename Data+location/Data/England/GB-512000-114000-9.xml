		<title>09Traffic Survey</title>
		<content>    On Tuesday 2nd July we carried out 
 a traffic survey of the main{A 24     
 road. We made{5 counts}in all at two  
 hourly intervals from 8.30 a.m. to    
 4.30 p.m. We counted the traffic in   
 quarter hourly sessions and then      
 multiplied by 4 to give the hourly    
 flow of traffic. We split each count  
 into four groups: cars; buses and     
 coaches; lorries and vans; bicycles   
 and motor cycles.                     
   The{8.30 a.m. count}proved the      
{busiest}with a total hourly rate of   
 2,032 vehicles, 1,036 of which were   
 passenger cars travelling to Horsham  
 and probably people on their way to   
 work. By 12.30 p.m. the rate had      
 dropped to 1,020 vehicles an hour but 
 by the start of the evening 'rush     
 hour' at 4.30 p.m. the rate was up to 
 1708 an hour again. We all felt a     
{by-pass}for Ashington is long overdue.</content>
