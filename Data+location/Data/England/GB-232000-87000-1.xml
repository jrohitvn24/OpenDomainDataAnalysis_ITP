		<title>01WERRINGTON &amp; DISTRICT</title>
		<content> The area is an agricultural one and is
 extremely pleasant scenically.It is   
 undulating and contains small hamlets 
 and minor roads.Its eastern boundary  
 is the A388 Launceston to Holsworthy  
 road and the River Tamar. The county  
 boundary in the west between Cornwall 
 and Devon runs close to this road.It  
 is an area of dairy farming with      
 holdings between about 50 to 300      
 acres.The area is pleasantly dotted   
 with plantations of mixed woodland    
 mainly deciduous. Except for farming  
 it has no other important industry.   
 Some farms take paying guests during  
 the summer.There is very little modern
 building in the area.The most         
 important building is Werrington      
 Mansion, set in its own grounds,of    
 Tudor origin;it has been added to in  
 the Georgian Age.
