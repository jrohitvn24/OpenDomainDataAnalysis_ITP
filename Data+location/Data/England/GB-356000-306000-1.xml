		<content>  The land between Eaton Constantine   
 and Wroxeter is mainly farmland with  
 crops and grass.There are two villages
 and three small groups of houses.     
 There is only one main road which is  
 the B4380.The other roads are narrow  
 and some barely wide enough for one   
 car.                                  
           {EATON CONSTANTINE          
  The village is built alongside the   
 road. There are a few black and       
 white buildings and a couple of new   
 houses. There are also two farms but  
 no shops.   {WROXETER                 
  Wroxeter is a village built near     
 the remains of a roman city. It has   
 houses of all ages and is the only    
 village in our block that has a shop.
