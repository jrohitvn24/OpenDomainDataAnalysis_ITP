		<content>   There has been a church in Waltham  
 since 1086 but the present building   
 has been there since the thirteenth   
 century.The church is open every day  
 so people can come to pray.There are  
 plenty of services on Sundays because 
 most people are not at work and can   
 attend.                               
   In 1086 there were 50 houses and    
 farms .Now with 2100 houses the       
 population has increased to 4700,but  
 despite that the Rector's work of     
 helping people is the same.The Church 
 also helps people by raising money.   
   After the church services people    
 wanted to meet together so the church 
 hall was built.Besides meetings there 
 are ladies keep- fit classes,dancing, 
 Cubs,Brownies,playschool and toddler  
 groups.The children also meet for     
 Sunday School when they learn about   
 Jesus.                                </content>
