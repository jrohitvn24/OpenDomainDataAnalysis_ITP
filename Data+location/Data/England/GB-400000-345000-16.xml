		<title>16Hill Farming round Whiston</title>
		<content>  Mr Williamson is a dairy farmer. He  
has 70 acres - forty pasture and       
thirty meadows. He has thirty five     
Holste acres -forty thirty young       
cattle. Underneath the ground it is    
mainly sandstone, which is quarried and
used for boundaries to fields. The     
milk goes to Ashborne to make milk     
products.                              
  In the winter he attends to the      
animals and manures the fields. In the 
spring, he harrows and rolls and       
spreads fed fertilizers to grow grass. 
In the summer he harvests the grass    
for winter cattle feed. In the autumn  
he tries to grow more grass with       
fertilizers to keep the cattle in the  
fields longer.                         
  In severe winters the water freezes  
so he gets less milk, and the milk     
tankers have difficulty in collecting  
milk in heavy snows.                   </content>
