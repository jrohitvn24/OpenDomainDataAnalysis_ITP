		<title>14A DOCTOR'S DAY(continued)</title>
		<content> At 11pm I go to bed, and hope the     
 phone doesn't ring! I read and then go
 to sleep.                             
   I think the best things about my job
 are making people better, and driving 
 through this lovely countryside. My   
 busiest season is always Winter,      
 because of all the coughs and colds.  
 The special things about being a      
 Doctor in Painswick,are that there are
 a lot of old people to look after, and
 some very nice school children!       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
