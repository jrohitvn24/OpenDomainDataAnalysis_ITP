		<title>12         LEISURE</title>
		<content>     Some of us spend our leisure time 
 running in Wighill Park.  The best    
 thing about running is you can do it  
 as a family and it keeps you fit. A   
 dozen or so people ride horses. Many  
 of the less active villagers like to  
 garden. For indoor activities adults  
 like to visit the Pub where they can  
 play darts and table tennis. Adults   
 can also play table tennis in the old 
 school hall. The most popular         
 children's activity is riding bikes.  
 Inside they like to play snooker on   
 their own tables or to watch          
 television.                           
                                       
    People have to make their own      
 activities as there are no proper     
 sports or leisure activities nearby.  
 They have to jump in their car and    
 go somewhere like Tadcaster for a     
 sports centre.                        </content>
