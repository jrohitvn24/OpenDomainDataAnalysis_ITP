		<title>15"Bowcombe"-Tourism.</title>
		<content>   Though{Bowcombe}is primarily an     
 agricultural area, the Island economy 
 depends heavily upon tourism, and     
 inevitably its effects are felt       
 indirectly if not directly;           
 particularly in increased traffic     
 during the Summer. The owner of       
 Cheverton Farm expanded his interests 
 into the Leisure Industry in 1936 when
 he set up his caravan site at nearbye 
 Atherfield. In this respect he        
 anticipated the much more recent trend
 of farmers to embark upon such        
 ventures.                             
   Like farming, the Leisure Industry  
 today is less labour intensive. "Once 
 I employed 59 staff and accommodated  
 450 people. Now I only employ half a  
 dozen for about half the number of    
 people---People don't plan ahead these
 days. We get many of our bookings at  
 short notice, even at the last minute"</content>
