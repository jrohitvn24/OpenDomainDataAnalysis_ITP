		<content>  14 families in Meysey Hampton have   
 children who attend Meysey Hampton    
 School. 14 families have children     
 either too young for school or who go 
 to school elsewhere or who are too old
 for school.                           
 There is a Mother and Toddler Club    
 which meets twice a week and a private
 nursery school for pre-school age     
 children. Secondary school pupils     
 travel by bus to Farmor's             
 Comprehensive School in Fairford.     
  The village school is a Church of    
 England Controlled School which was   
 built in 1872 and is now attended by  
 39 children.                          
  There is a Youth Club and a Cub Scout
 pack. There are Brownie and Guide     
 companies in neighbouring villages.
