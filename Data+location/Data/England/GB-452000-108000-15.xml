		<content> Fairthorne Msnor was owned by William 
 de la Hoole and his wife Agnes in     
 l854, when the Manor was built, but it
 has been reconstructed many times.    
    In l947 it was taken over by the   
 Y.M.C.A.  It has been built up and now
 owns 94 acres.  The house had many    
 historical sculptures and crests      
 carved into the walls                 
    It also has a hidden room at the   
 side of the house.  There are two     
 panels, glass, but they are not part  
 of any known room.  There are plans to
 get into  the room.
