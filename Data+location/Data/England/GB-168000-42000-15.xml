		<title>15REDRUTH SUMMER FAIR</title>
		<content> Every summer the fair visits Redruth. 
 They visit 28 different places every  
 year.The furthest away is at          
 Bristol.They only travel from Easter  
 to November.In winter they repair,    
 maintain and  decorate the            
 equipment.There are 17 rides and 60   
 different games.The hardest of these  
 to put up is the Dodgems. All rides   
 are tested before the fair opens, but 
 the owner is not afraid of any serious
 accidents.300 to 400 people work for  
 the fair. The shortest time they have 
 taken to dismantle the fair is 4      
 hours.They greatly enjoy living in    
 caravans, and travelling from one     
 place to another.Many of the people   
 have been with the fair all their     
 life. Some of them have a permanent   
 home which they use when the fair is  
 closed in Winter.The deVey family own 
 this particular fair.                 </content>
