        A few modern shops have been   
built in Viewpark recently but most    
are small general stores. Some are run 
by Pakistanis. Market Square has a few 
food shops, a post office and a hard-  
ware store. Butchers and bakers go     
round the streets in vans.             
       Most people leave to do their   
shopping in Bellshill (2.5 miles) or   
Uddingston (2 miles). An Uddings-      
ton survey in 1979 said 13% of its     
shoppers came from Viewpark. Udd-      
ingston's shops are nearly all on      
its main street.                       
       We spoke to two housewives      
who said they only bought bread,       
milk and newspapers in Viewpark.       
Sometimes they would go to the         
market for clothing. Mostly they       
went to Bellshill or Glasgow.
