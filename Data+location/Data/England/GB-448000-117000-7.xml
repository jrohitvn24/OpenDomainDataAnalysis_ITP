		<content>    The Secondary School admits all the
 children from Bishopstoke, Horton     
 Heath, Durley and Upham, that is from 
 a radius of 3 miles around the campus.
    A typical day's programme for a    
 child ; the Junior School would be:-  
 Assembly- Language, Mathematics, some 
 creative work ( either music, craft,  
 gymnastics or games ), a project (that
 is a special study to include aspects 
 of History, Geography and Science )   
 and basic French.                     
    The size of classes varies somewhat
 in the Junior School from 28 in Year 4
 to 34/37 in other years.              
    Meals are provided for those who   
 require them, cooked in the Infant    
 School kitchen. The majority of       
 children,however, bring sandwiches. In
 the Secondary School, there is a      
 cafeteria system which is very        
 popular.                              </content>
