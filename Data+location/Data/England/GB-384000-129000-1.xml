 This area is mainly on Blackmore vale 
 where the main agriculture is managed 
 grassland for dairy and beef cattle.  
 The soil is a heavy clay and generally
 unsuitable for ploughing. The land    
 rises to the north and east to a      
 greensand ridge. Most of the unmanaged
 woodland is in this area which is too 
 steep to plough.  Some people live and
 work on the farms but the majority of 
 the residents are retired people      
 living in old cottages. Most of the   
 people have moved in from other parts 
 of the country. Some of the woodland  
 is common land and is inhabited by    
 badger, foxes and roe deer as well as 
 a wide variety of birds.
