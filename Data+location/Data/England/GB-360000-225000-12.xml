		<title>12MR AND MRS SMITH'S MOVE</title>
		<content> Mr and Mrs Smith used to live at 5    
 Ross Road in Brampton Abbotts when the
 landlady decided to sell the cottages,
 one of which Mr and Mrs Smith lived   
 in.They moved on a Saturday in        
 February and hired a van for Â£10 to   
 move the furniture to a new estate in 
 Ross.They found their new rented house
 had central heating which meant it was
 very warm,a modern kitchen which      
 pleased Mrs Smith and the house had a 
 nice sized garden for Mr Smith to     
 manage.Their house is nearer to town  
 which is convienent for them but they 
 have to use the car more because Mrs  
 Smith works in Brampton Abbotts.Mr    
 Smith brings Mrs Smith in his car to  
 the school each morning.
