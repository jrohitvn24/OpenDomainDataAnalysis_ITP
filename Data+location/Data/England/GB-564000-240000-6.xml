		<title>06The Surgery, Church Street.</title>
		<content> We visited the Doctor's Surgery. There
 are two doctors, who are man and wife.
 The lady doctor is{Dr.Ridley,}and her 
 husband is{Dr.Slade.}Our local doctor 
 used to be{Dr.Fleming,}who is         
 Alexander Fleming's son, but he has   
 retired now.We interviewed the        
 receptionist.They don't have many     
 emergency calls.Blood pressure,       
 diabetes, asthma, ear problems, kidney
 problems are the main reasons people  
 go to the doctor.There is a surgery   
 every weekday, in the morning and     
 every day except Wednesday in the     
 afternoon. On Saturday there is a time
 for emergency calls only.On Tuesday   
 there is an{Ante-Natal clinic,}and on 
 Thursday there is a{Well Woman and    
{Family Planning Clinic.}If people do  
 not live near a chemist,they can get  
 their medecine from the surgery,but   
 otherwise they must use the chemist.  </content>
