   Out of 62 families :                
                                       
 32 were concerned about violence      
 26 were concerned about drugs         
 25 were concerned about unemployment  
 22 were concerned about pollution     
 21 were concerned about war           
                                       
   There were small numbers of people  
concerned about a large variety of     
subjects such as general lack of       
discipline and manners and world       
selfishness.                           
                                       
   Seven families expressed no concerns
and one was generally optimistic about 
the future.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
