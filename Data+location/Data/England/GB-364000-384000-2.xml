		<title>02ON THE EDGE OF LYMM</title>
		<content> The area to the South of Lymm is      
 very rural.  From here to the         
 outskirts of Grappenhall to the west  
 are miles of neat, tidy farms, both   
 dairy farms and arable farms.  The    
 arable farms grow mainly barley,      
 though wheat is important with some   
 fields of potatoes being apparent.    
 The farm houses look well to do,      
 being substantial houses rather than  
 small cottages.  There is much        
 woodland in this pleasant undulating  
 land south of the River Mersey.       
 It is hard to believe that you are    
 only 3 miles fron the industrial      
 town of Warrington, but the M6,       
 which disects the area in the form    
 of the Thelwall Viaduct is a clear    
 reminder.  On a clear day looking     
 North from the A5O bridge over the    
 M6 Warrington can be clearly seen     
 with white smoke from Lever Brothers. </content>
