		<title>02DEVELOPMENT OF RED HOUSES</title>
		<content>    Where Red Houses is now, less than 
 twenty years ago the only buildings   
 standing in this area were those      
 clustered around Red Houses itself.   
 This included a farm. Since then      
 three large housing estates have been 
 built in the surroundings. The first  
 was Les Quennevais around 1964 and    
 about this time also Clos Des         
 Sables was being built. Before these, 
 large areas were just sand dunes all  
 the way down to St Ouen's Bay. Once   
 these two estates had been built the  
 area became populated and since it was
 a success they built another housing  
 estate, Don Farm, a bit further up the
 airport road. At this time the        
 Communicare Centre was also built. So 
 this part of the west of the island is
 now quite densely populated.
