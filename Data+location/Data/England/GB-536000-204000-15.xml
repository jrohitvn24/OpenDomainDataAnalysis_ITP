		<title>15Rochford's Garden Centre</title>
		<content> The name of Rochfords has been well   
 known in the area for the past four   
 generations. Today the family run a   
 garden and landscape centre on a six  
 acre site in Turnford.                
                                       
 The firm employs twenty-four staff to 
 deal with the seven to eight hundred  
 people who visit the centre each week.
 The most popular selling plant is the 
 African Violet and the oldest plant is
 the Cycad which is a plant that dates 
 back to the times of the dinosaurs.   
                                       
 The plants are looked after by experts
 and some thousands of gallons of water
 a day are needed to keep the plants in
 good condition.
