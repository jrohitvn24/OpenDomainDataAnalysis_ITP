		<title>06THE GOLDEN FLEECE PUB</title>
		<content>  Mr Bill Voce is considered to be one 
 of the more important inhabitants of  
 South Croxton. He is, of course, the  
 landlord of the local public house,   
 The Golden Fleece. Bill Voce was      
 interviewed from the angle of "A day  
 in the life of....". Bill took over   
 the Golden Fleece two years ago. He   
 has always found his customers very   
 friendly and he thinks that South     
 Croxton is a happy and friendly       
 village. He actually owns the pub and 
 so the Golden Fleece is a free house  
 which means that it is not attached to
 just one brewery, though Bill buys    
 most of the beer from Ruddles brewery.
  Originally the Golden Fleece building
 used to be a small cottage, a         
 methodist hall and a blacksmith which 
 have now been knocked into one. These 
 buildings date back to 1750.
