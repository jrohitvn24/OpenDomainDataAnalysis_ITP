		<title>19FARMING IN MIDDLETON</title>
		<content> There are several farms on the        
 outskirts of the town. The average    
 size is 50 acres. Production is mainly
{dairy}with herds of about 1 cow per   
 acre, the main breeds being British   
 Fresian with a few Ayrshire. Home     
 produced feed is mainly silage, with  
 small scale hay production, which is  
 too dependent on the weather.         
{Beef}production has increased since   
 the E.E.C. sponsored a move away from 
 dairy farming. This is mainly         
 intensive indoor production of British
 Fresian, Hereford, Charolais &amp;        
 Aberdeen Angus.                       
{Poultry}production is very small scale
 owing to pressure from massive        
 "factory farms" about the country.    
{Pigs}are bred on small farms but      
 "finishing" is done at large-scale    
 centres.                              
 Very little{crop-farming}is done.     </content>
