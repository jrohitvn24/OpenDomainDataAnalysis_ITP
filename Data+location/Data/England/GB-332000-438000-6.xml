		<content> Poulton has a thriving community which
 has many local societies. These are   
 held in church halls at regular times 
 during the week.There is a            
 Photographic Society,Badminton Club,  
 Rambling Society, and a popular       
 Amateur Dramatics group. The          
 Conservative Club and Poulton Social  
 Club have their own premises. There   
 are many public houses in the area,   
 which are popular with young and old, 
 and there is also one nightclub,      
 catering for the 18-40 age group.     
 There are three Scout packs, and Guide
 packs being run in the same area. This
 along with the St. Johns Ambulance    
 Service gives younger children        
 opportunities to take up a worthwhile 
 hobby. Recently a youth club for 14-24
 year olds has opened at College House 
 which has proved popular.
