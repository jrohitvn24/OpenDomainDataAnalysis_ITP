		<content> Kilmington has a church and a chapel, 
 both of which are well-attended.      
{THE CHURCH.}                          
 The Church of St. Giles was built     
 in 1862.   It is made of stone and has
 stained glass windows.   The roof is  
 mostly slate, but there are also      
 tiles, and there is a tower with a    
 clock which strikes the quarter hours.
 The vicar of our parish is also       
 responsible for Shute and Whitford.   
 There is a churchyard which is        
 still used for burials.               
{THE CHAPEL.                           
 The Baptist Chapel was built in 1832  
 and is attended by people who live in 
 Kilmington and who come from outside  
 the village.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
