WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE DIFFERENT TYPES  
OF PETS THE CHILDREN IN CLASS 4K HAVE. 
WE ALSO SPOKE ABOUT WHY WE CHOSE OUR   
PETS.                                  
DOGS SEEM TO BE THE MOST POPULAR WITH  
CATS A CLOSE SECOND.OTHER PETS INCLUDED
A TORTOISE, A WHITE RAT,RABBITS,       
GERBILS, HAMSTERS AND GOLDFISH.        
THE MAIN REASON FOR CHOOSING EITHER A  
DOG OR A CAT, OR BOTH, WAS THAT THEY   
COULD SHOW AFFECTION BACK TO THEIR     
OWNERS AND, IN THE CASE OF DOGS, YOU   
COULD TAKE THEM OUT WITH YOU FOR WALKS.
THE CHILDREN WHO HAD SMALL CAGED       
ANIMALS SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED
TO HAVE A LARGE PET AS THEY MADE A MESS
IN THE HOUSE OR THAT IT WASN'T FAIR TO 
LEAVE AN ANIMAL IN THE HOME ON ITS OWN 
ALL DAY. THE CHILDREN SAID THEIR PETS  
GAVE THEM A LOT OF PLEASURE AND THAT   
THEY ENJOYED LOOKING AFTER THEM.       </content>
