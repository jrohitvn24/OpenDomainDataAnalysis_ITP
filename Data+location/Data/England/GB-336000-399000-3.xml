		<content> Our sub-divisions of Merseyside Police
 has a superintendent in charge at Copy
 Lane Police Station.   The            
 sub-division is divided up into beats.
  The beats in the town are much       
 smaller than those in the country     
 because thereis more property to      
 protect.  The men work 24 hours a day 
 in a 3-shift system beginning at 7    
 a.m.  There are 3 beats covering our  
 area with one man to each beat.  There
 is l panda car to each 3 beats.  These
 cars and some traffic cars are based  
 at Maghull Police station which deals 
 mainly with traffic incidents.        
 There aren't enough police to have    
 men and cars for each beat, so there  
 is a 'ripple' system to provide       
 back-up where needed.   The man on    
 the beat can radio for pandas, then   
 fast response cars, then special      
 support cars if necessary.            </content>
