		<content>There are numerous opportunities for   
recreation in our block - especially   
sailing and water sports on the marina 
and on the canal.Dinghy sailing is a   
popular pastime on the marina,whilst on
the canal cruising is the main         
attraction. Canoeing is done on both   
marina and the canal,and organized     
cruises operate from the Glasson Dock  
quayside. Pupils from our school have  
canoeing lessons on the yacht basin in 
the summer, but they must always wear a
lifejacket and have passed their bronze
swimming award before they are         
allowed. There are two football pitches
used by local amateur teams close by   
the school. These are used at weekends 
in the winter time.
