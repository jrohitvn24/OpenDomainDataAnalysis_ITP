		<content> My riding instructor lives at Hole    
 Farm in the Nutley part of Ashdown    
 Forest. Sometimes I ride on the forest
 with her. She has two ponies of her   
 own and the rest are at livery. She   
 keeps ducks and geese as well as      
 horses and has made some lakes        
 containing Golden Orfe and trout. She 
 puts different varieties of water     
 lilies in the lakes. She has also made
 some dams. They have quite a big farm 
 with a lot of land. The stables are   
 well made from dark brown wood. The   
 indoor riding school is quite big     
 which is good because there is space  
 for cantering. She also gives Pony    
 Club lessons.
