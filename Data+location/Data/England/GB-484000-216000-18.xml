old.The back part of the house is 250  
years old but the front part of the    
house has only just been built.They    
have old barns that have been converted
into rooms and one is being made into  
a play room.There is a granary from    
years ago.They have two fields which   
have no crops at all.The only animals  
they have are chickens.The farm is not 
a working farm.They have four acres of 
land they have stables but they use    
them as sheds and the front bit of the 
house is very bumpy.
