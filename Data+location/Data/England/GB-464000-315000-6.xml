		<content> Most of the roads in the Thrussington 
 &amp; Hoby area are very narrow. There are
 verges &amp; hedgerows beside the road.   
 Also there are dykes at the side of   
 the road so that when it rains the    
 water flows into them.All these roads 
 are tarmaced but there are many roads 
 that lead to farms in the area which  
 are just tracks and so have no surface
 on them.                              
                                       
 Trees and hedges are very important to
 wildlife.This is because the wildlife 
 need to nest and lay in them.         
                                       
 There is only one main road going     
 through this area &amp; that is the A607  
 from Melton Mowbray to Leicester.     
                                       
 Hoby village is a long village built  
 around a bendy road.
