		<title>16 Hemsworth Local Newspaper</title>
		<content> The Express Newspaper began as a      
 family business in the late nineteenth
 century. The family was               
 called Hinchliffe. The paper was going
 well until a printing office offered a
 large amount of money to buy the      
 newspaper.                            
 This larger concern at first covered  
 the Hemsworth area and then expanded  
 to include South Elmsall. They printed
 about 8,000 copies and now print      
 18,000.                               
 There are four people working in the  
 office, three of whom are reporters,  
 the other is the editor.              
 The paper is printed in Wakefield and 
 concentrates on local news events and 
 distasteful and memorable stories.
