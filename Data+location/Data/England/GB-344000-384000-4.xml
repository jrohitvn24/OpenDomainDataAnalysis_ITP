		<title>04Transport survey in Halewood</title>
		<content>      We questioned a number of local  
 families to see how they used the     
 public transport in the area.         
      Out of the forty four families   
 that were questioned only two did not 
 use any form of public transport.     
      All the local buses are used.    
 The buses to Liverpool city centre are
 the services most commonly used. Also 
 very well used are the services to    
 local shopping centres and markets.   
      Thirty eight families use the    
 buses once a week or more, only two   
 families use the services less than   
 once a week.                          
      We were surprised to see that    
 there were very few complaints about  
 services. The main complaints were    
 poor timekeeping and overcrowding.    
      The main reason the buses are    
 used so well is that of the families  
 questioned only eight had a car.      </content>
