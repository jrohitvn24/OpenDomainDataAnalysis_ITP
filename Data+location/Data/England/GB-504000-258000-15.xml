		<title>15Growing Thatch Straw</title>
		<content> There are many thatched cottages in   
 Thurleigh and one of the local farmers
 grows wheat straw especially for      
 thatching. The straw is specially     
 harvested and is left long, some 2 or 
 3ft in length so it can be used for   
 thatching. Modern combining methods   
 would leave the straw too short to be 
 of any value to a thatcher. In order  
 to keep the straw to the necessary    
 length, an old fashioned binder is    
 used to cut the wheat. It is then     
 either put into a thresher drum or    
 combed in a similar way to wool. The  
 end result is combed wheat reed, which
 is then neatly bundled, ready for use.
 Thatching and growing the materials is
 a thriving business and not as may be 
 thought a thing of the past.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
