		<content> Most of the Otham people interviewed  
 said they preferred Otham to nearby   
 Parkwood because it was far cleaner   
 and quieter, though they did have     
 transport problems and there were no  
 shops. There is much woodland and     
 farmland in the parish, however, and  
 the amenities include a cricket       
 ground, a pub and a telephone box.    
 Many Parkwood residents agreed as to  
 how their area has changed in recent  
 years. They felt it was now noisier,  
 dirtier, and far more industrialized, 
 but, though it has more traffic,      
 transport is better and there are more
 shops.                                
 Boughton Monchelsea is an             
 old-established village surrounded by 
 farmland; it ahs retained a couple of 
 shops. The residents seem to find it a
 pleasant place to live and a happy    
 community.                            </content>
