		<title>15CORNISH GRANITE QUARRY</title>
		<content> The granite which is taken from       
 Hantergantick is a closed grain high  
 quality silver grey Cornish granite   
 with light pieces of mica.            
 Hantergantick also import granite,    
 Vicking Silver Blue from Sweden and   
 Valencia Pink from Spain.They have    
 seven different surface finishes which
 are ideal for paving stones or        
 buildings.The granite from            
 Hantergantick has been used in the    
 construction of many famous London    
 landmarks such as The Tower Bridge,The
 New Post Office Block,The Commercial  
 Union Office Block and The Eddystone  
 Lighthouse which isn't in London and I
 expect other places aswell.About a    
 year ago a frigate called The Jupiter 
 knocked a nine tonne piece of granite 
 from The London Bridge which men from 
 Hantergantick mended.
