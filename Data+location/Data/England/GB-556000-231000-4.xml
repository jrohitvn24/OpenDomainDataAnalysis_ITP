		<title>04HAMPERDEN END VILLAGE</title>
		<content>      The village used to be known as{ 
{Amberden End.}There are only 12 houses
 there.There are no shops or Post      
 Office,the nearest shop is at{Henham. 
 There is a bus once a week to take    
 people shopping.The{mobile library    
 stops at{Debden Green}and the people  
 of Hamperden End have to go there to  
 it.There is a{mobile fish shop}which  
 goes through the village.There is no  
 school at Hamperden End and the Local 
 Authority hires a taxi to take the    
 children to{Debden School.}The nearest
 petrol station is at Debden Green.It  
 is very quiet, there are no play areas
 for the children and no local         
 employment unless it is on a farm.    
      The advantages of living in such 
 a small place are that the houses are 
{not overlooked}and very secluded.There
 is a lot of nature to be seen,lots of 
 small woods and{deer}are not uncommon.</content>
