 In our area we have fairly mixed      
 housing but predominately             
 owned.Council houses are very rare in 
 our area.A house on the A6 dates      
 back to 1898.Mostly private houses in 
 this area range from 400 years        
 old.Houses of long ago had bigger     
 gardens than the houses of today with 
 the smaller gardens.Houses of today   
 have double glazing as old houses used
 to have shutters and lead             
 windows.Thatched houses with beams and
 wooden walls are very few nowadays.Big
 houses were quite rare in the         
 seventeenth century.One woman actually
 lived in a barn before living in      
 Hathern.
