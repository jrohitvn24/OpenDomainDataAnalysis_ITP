		<title>04Farming near Burscough</title>
		<content> The major land use in this area is    
agricultural grade one.                
Much of the land is moss land          
and was submerged beneath Martin Mere  
at one time one of the largest lakes in
Lancashire.Over the last three hundred 
years schemes to drain the lake have   
led to the situation today with several
miles of near flat fields seperated by 
drainage ditches growing crops such as 
peas,potatoes and carrots.             
 The moss soils are organic,fertile    
soils with patches of sand and clay    
making them ideal for arable farming.  
The land is easy to work.The soil tends
to be very wet and good drainage is    
essential.Local climate is mild and    
there are few frosts.Flooding on low   
lying moss land has been a problem but 
since 1961 a drainage scheme linked to 
the Ribble estuary has improved this.
