		<content> Coxheath Junior School was built in   
 1963 and opened in 1964 as a joint    
 Junior and Infant school.  The Infants
 broke away in 1974 when a new separate
 building opened.  When the Junior     
 School opened there were 100 pupils in
 total compared with 227 Junior        
 children in 1985.                     
                                       
 At present (July 1985) there are eight
 classes, two for each of four year age
 groups.The layout of the school is    
 basically in a 'T' shape, with four   
 rooms forming each of the two arms and
 a hall at the junction of the two.    
 The full range of curriculum subjects 
 is taught and there is a wide range of
 extra-curricular activities.  In 1985 
 the boys' football team tied for first
 place in the Maidstone area           
 seven-a-side competition.
