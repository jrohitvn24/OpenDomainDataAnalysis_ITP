		<title>17A Day in My Life in Ingleton</title>
		<content> After I had eaten my dinner I had 45  
 minutes free time before afternoon    
 school started. It was a wet playtime 
 so I stayed in the classroom and      
 played with the centicubes. School    
 started at 1.15pm and the first       
 session was drama. We all practised   
 our parts for assembly. We returned   
 from the hall to our classroom at     
 about 1.55pm and had our library      
 session where we were able to change  
 our library books.The afternoon break 
 started at 2.25pm. I went out on to   
 the playground and played catch until 
 the whistle went at 2.40pm. Thursday  
 afternoon after break is our games    
 session and we played rounders until  
 3.45pm which was home time.           
 I arrived home at about 4.00pm and    
 collected my swimming costume, I went 
 to the open air pool and stayed there 
 until 6.00pm.                         </content>
