		<content> Dear Headmaster,                      
 Footpaths : Great Bolas &amp; Eaton Upon  
 Tern                                  
                                       
 It made me very sad to read in the    
 Telford Journal newspaper that pupils 
 from your school were unable to find  
 the footpaths in Great Bolas and Eaton
 Upon Tern.  I  shoud add sad not at   
 all suprised by your findings as the  
 public rights of way in Shropshire are
 in terrible state.  I have had an     
 uphill struggle over fit to walk      
                                       
 If you let me know just what footpaths
 your pupils were trying walk/find and 
 the nature of the obstructions they   
 encountered I will task the council   
 with trying to get them cleared.      
                                       
 I enclose a few leafts that your      
 pupils may find interesting.          </content>
