		<title>01The Adur Valley - Henfield</title>
		<content>{  Landscape}is dominated by the upper 
 reaches of the{River Adur,}its tribu- 
 tory streams and its flood plain. The 
 land rolls gently upwards to the ridge
 on which the village of Henfield is   
 set, to the South. Its character is   
 largely determined by the nature of   
 farming which it supports. The land is
 principally{agricultural,}both arable 
 and pastural, with a liberal          
 sprinkling of shaws (small woodlands  
 originally planted as cover for game  
 birds).                               
   Population is relatively sparse,    
 distributed in the scattered farms,   
 farm cottages, and a group of houses  
 and bungalows along the Horsham -     
 Henfield road which forms part of the 
 hamlet of Shermanbury.
