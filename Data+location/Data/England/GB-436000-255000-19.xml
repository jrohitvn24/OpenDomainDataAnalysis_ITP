 of{Queen Mary,}following the death of 
{Northumberland,}the owner of old town 
 was asked where the money was but he  
 didn't say a word.  So they put him on
 a stretching machine until his fingers
 were pulled out of their joints, but  
 he still said nothing.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
 Old Town's owner survived to be       
 reinstated representing Warwick in {  
{Queen Mary's Parliament. }From that   
 day to this the treasure has still not
 been found.                           
                                       
   {NOT YET!
