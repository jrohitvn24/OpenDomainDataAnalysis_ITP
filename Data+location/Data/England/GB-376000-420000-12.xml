		<title>12FILTER STATION, HELMSHORE.</title>
		<content> The filter station is a building that 
 cleans water from the second main     
 reservoir.Workers put it in a big     
 tank and then they put chemicals in   
 the water. Next it goes to the        
 people's homes.                       
                                       
 The filter station has big tanks round
 the back and some at the front as     
 well. They let some water in to the   
 first reservoir and all the debris    
 goes into the sludge tanks.           
                                       
 They have a pump house to pump water  
 around to homes. If the top reservoir 
 overflows, there are bywashes at the  
 side of the reservoir. They let the   
 water into the first reservoir and    
 then it goes to a cotton mill.
