		<content>Horton-cum-Studley is a straggling     
village seven miles E.N.E. of Oxford   
and three miles from Beckley. The      
houses are mainly modern and built in  
groups set back from the through road. 
Some of these groups have won design   
awards. There are some older buildings 
such as the Victorian Church, Studley  
Priory Hotel, the Almshouses built in  
1636 and several stone farms and       
thatched cottages. There is a Post     
Office/ Village Stores which sells     
petrol, a public house called the      
King's Arms and a small  village hall.
