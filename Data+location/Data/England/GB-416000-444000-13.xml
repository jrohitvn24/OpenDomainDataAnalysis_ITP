		<title>13EMPLOYMENT IN OTLEY</title>
		<content>  There are 163 jobs available in      
 and around Otley and Ilkley also      
 Yeadon and Burley. The average man    
 brings home mostly over 70 pounds a   
 week. 23 of the available jobs are in 
 Otley. Every two days 163 people come 
 into the job centre; about 90 - 100   
 people may go into the job centre a   
 day.                                  
   There are more people in the job    
 centre on a Monday because it is      
 signing on day so the unemployed come 
 in to see what jobs are on offer. The 
 jobs in the area are sent to the job  
 centre so that people who have no job 
 can see most of the jobs which are    
 vacant. Cards are typed out with the  
 details, and people read them when    
 they are fixed to the display boards.
