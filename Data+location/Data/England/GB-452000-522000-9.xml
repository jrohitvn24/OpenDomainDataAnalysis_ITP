		<content> Most of the land in the 12 square     
 kilometres at the mouth of the River  
 Tees is reclaimed.  The land on which 
 Monsanto stands (North of the River   
 Tees) was reclaimed since 1967.  The  
 reclamation of that land     of the   
 site of I.C.I. N. Tees and of the site
 of Shell Oil U.K. followed a similar  
 method.  Bunds were built to enclose  
 lagoons, dumping of waste, especially 
 slag, was used to fill these ponds and
 progresdively the water was pumpred   
 out.  Roads and rail tracks were      
 embanked; indeed the roads occupied   
 the positions of the original bunds.  
 An area of over 12 square kilometres  
 to the north of the river alone has   
 been reclaimed in the last twenty     
 years.  The advantage of reclaimed    
 land is that extensive flat areas are 
 made available.
