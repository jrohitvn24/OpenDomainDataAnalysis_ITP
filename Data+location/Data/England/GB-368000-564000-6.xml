		<content>   The health centre in Haltwhistle was
 opened four years ago and is one of   
 the most up to date in the area.  It  
 works on an appointment system and has
 four resident doctors and three nurses
 who also make visits to patients in   
 outlying areas.  The centre also      
 houses a child welfare clinic and a   
 dental clinic.                        
   The War Memorial Hospital was       
 created from a large house at the time
 of the First World War.  Many local   
 people were born in its maternity unit
 but this had to be closed down when   
 the only maternity nurse in the town  
 had her own baby.  Today mothers must 
 travel 15 miles to Hexham to have     
 their babies.  The hospital has an    
 outpatients accident department but   
 its main work is in caring for elderly
 patients who can no longer look after 
 themselves.                           </content>
