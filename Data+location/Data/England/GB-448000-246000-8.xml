		<content>There are four shops in Chipping Warden
The village shop and Post Office has   
been a shop for 25 years. The butchers 
has been a shop for 48 years. It is    
owned by Mr Davis. The hairdressers is 
owned by Mrs Davis  and has been there 
for 17 years. The Pine Shop was at one 
time a woodyard and the local          
undertaker was Mr John Read. This      
belonged to the estate belonging to    
Lord North's family. All sorts of      
carpentry work was carried on in the   
yard. At this house fencing materials  
were made as well as being the centre  
for other building works. The shop was 
built about ten years ago with old     
bricks and was a craft shop. Mrs       
Shrimpton ran this for three years and 
she also sold stripped pine. She then  
moed the craft business to Milton      
Keynes. The Venning family now sell    
antique stripped pine furniture.       </content>
