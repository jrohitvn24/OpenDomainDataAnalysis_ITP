		<title>12PRIMARY SCHOOL, SADDLEWORTH</title>
		<content> St. Chad's C. E. Primary School is a  
 single storey building of pre-cast    
 concrete structure with large windows 
 and a flat roof.It is typical of the  
 buildings of that era, but contrasts  
 markedly with older stone buildings in
 Saddleworth Fold. It is a sign of     
 changing times, &amp; in the 1980's would 
 possibly have been planned differently
 again because of the current trend to 
 design buildings 'in keeping' with the
 character of the area. The school has 
 210 pupils of primary age, &amp; 7 staff  
 including Mrs. Bernice Magson, the    
 first headmistress of the new school. 
 Its curriculum is modern, open-plan.  
 It caters for children from farms,    
 working-class backgrounds &amp; middle-   
 class commuters. It is of 'Controlled'
 status with expenses met by Oldham    
 Borough Council. Chairman of the Board
 of Governors is Vicar of St. Chad's.  </content>
