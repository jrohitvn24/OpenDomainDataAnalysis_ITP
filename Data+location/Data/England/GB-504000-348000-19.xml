		<title>19CHANGES:LEASINGHAM (PART2)</title>
		<content>  To the south of the village was a    
 land army canteen.Where the village   
 hall now stands was a wooden 'Boy's   
 Club'and on Chapel Lane there was a   
 water tower.There was{only one shop   
 and the Duke of Wellington public     
 house.A{rail -way line,}which carried 
 one goods train daily, ran across Hall
 Farm north -west through the village. 
  Between 1961 and 1971,estates of     
 bungalows and detached houses were    
 built and the{population rose by 103% 
 to 1110.The 1981 census showed 525    
 households in the village with 1517   
 people.                               
  In 1981,27% of Leasingham's working  
 population was employed by the{Armed  
{Forces-}principally at{R.A.F.Cranwell 
 5 miles away.Another 5% were employed 
 as civilians.Without the jobs at R.A.F
 Cranwell the village would probably   
 have died in the 1950's and 1960's.'  </content>
