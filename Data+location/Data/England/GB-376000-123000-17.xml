		<title>17Thorngrove House.</title>
		<content> Thorngrove is a beautiful house in    
 spacious grounds on the outskirts of  
 Gillingham.It has survived two wars   
 and several changes of use.We first   
 meet the house in the 1900's as the   
 lovely home of Sir Harold Pelly, 5th  
 Baronet and Lady Pelly. During the    
 second world war the house was used to
 billet American soldiers.Many of these
 have since returned to visit the house
 and the many friends they made in the 
 area. After the war the property was  
 bought on behalf of Dr.Barnardos and  
 was run as a Children's Home. The     
 interior decoration was changed to the
 sombre colours used in institutions at
 that time.Some twelve years later the 
 children were transferred to the      
 Barnardos Home in Horsington and      
 Thorngrove House was once again for   
 sale.
