		<content> There is a variety of holiday         
 accomodation including Bed and        
 Breakfast, holiday cottages, and a    
 Motel. There are 3 public houses and a
 garage. Some of the roads are narrow  
 with dangerous parts. It is a very    
 quiet area. Sometimes it is very hot  
 but it can get cold too and very wet. 
 It is also very windy in Burnt Yates  
 because of its exposed position.      
 There are two small schools with      
 about 30 to 40 pupils in whole school.
 Most of the area is grass land and is 
 rough and hilly. In 1985 it has been a
 very wet summer. It affected the hay  
 because the rain makes the bails too  
 heavy and it is not dry enough. So,   
 most farmers made it into silage.     
 Probably, there will be too much      
 silage produced.
