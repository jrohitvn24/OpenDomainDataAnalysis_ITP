		<content>{ Description of Reservoir             
 The reservoir was built between 1957  
 and 1960. The shore on one side is    
 slate and small stones. The banks     
 around the reservoir are covered in   
 grass with a few flowers. The water is
 very deep. On the other side of the   
 dam are storage pools.                
{Purpose of Reservoir }                
 The reservoir is used for fishing and 
 sailing.                              
{Land Use Around The Reservoir         
 The land is uncultivated. Some of the 
 fields have cows and sheep in them.   
 There are a few coniferous trees and a
 few cottages nearby.                  
{Public Access To The Reservoir        
 There is a road which leads to the car
 park where we left the minibus. The   
 car park is situated so that people   
 can look at the reservoir from their  
 cars. Around the car-park are benches </content>
