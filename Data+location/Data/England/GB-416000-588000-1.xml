		<content> This area is mostly farmland which has
 changed verylittle over the year,     
 except there is now more land         
 cultivated for growing crops rather   
 than grassland for grazing cattle and 
 sheep on part of the most southerly   
 section running adjacent to the main  
 A1 truck road there is a fruit and    
 vegetablle picking farm and slightly  
 nrth west of this a very large garden 
 centre. One of the large estates,     
 Espley Hall, part of the land has been
 sold to adjoining farms to make up for
 land taken for opencast mining east   
 of Hebron village. Espley Hall        
 property is now a restaurant and      
 function centre Hebron Village has    
 enlarged with the addition of a small 
 bungalow estate. The church is still  
 the only community centre.
