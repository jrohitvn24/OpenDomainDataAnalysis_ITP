		<content> Council Worker.                       
 I get up at 6.30 AM have a cup of     
 coffee but no breakfast and cycle to  
 Holmes Chapel, that is 5 miles.  We   
 travel from Holmes Chapel by motor    
 lorry to our work.  We start at 8.00  
 AM.  I work for Cheshire County       
 Council doing road repairs chiefly.  I
 lay kerbs and footpaths, and lay tar  
 all day.  We have half an hour for    
 lunch.  We finish work at 4.30 PM.  On
 Fridays we finish early at 3.30 PM.   
 We work 39 hours a week.  In the      
 winter time we are on call.  That     
 means we could be called out to grit  
 the roads in frosty weather.  In the  
 evenings I work in my garden growing  
 vegetable and flowers.  Sometimes I   
 help out at a local farm.
