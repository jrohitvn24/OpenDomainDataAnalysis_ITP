		<title>02GROWTH OF WORKSOP</title>
		<content> Worksop probably predates a Saxon     
 settlement on the south side of the   
 Ryton valley. Radford Priory was      
 founded in 1103 and gave rise to the  
 community of Radford. The population  
 of the market town of Worksop         
 increased dramatically in the 17th.   
 and 18th. centuries as a result of the
 opening of the Chesterfield Canal in  
 1777 and the change of emphasis of    
 local industry from malting, milling, 
 timber working and liquorice growing  
 to coal mining. Manton colliery was   
 sunk in 1898 and is today a major     
 employer in the town. Worksop station 
 was built in 1849. Mains water was    
 provided in 1878 and the sewage works 
 was completed in 1881. Worksop is     
 today Bassetlaw's largest town with   
 a population of 30,000 plus.
