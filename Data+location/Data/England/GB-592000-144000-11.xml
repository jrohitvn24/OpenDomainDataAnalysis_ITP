		<title>11DERING WINDOWS</title>
		<content> Many of the older buildings in and    
 around Pluckley have unusual          
 arch-shaped windows. This dates from  
 the time of the Civil War             
 1642-1652. Sir Edward Dering,the Lord 
 of the Manor,did not agree with either
 the Royalist or the Parliamentarians. 
 He was arrested by thr Roundheads but 
 managed to escape and returned to     
 Pluckley. His Manor house was searched
 by the Roundheads and he escaped      
 through a small arched window which   
 his pursuers considered too small to  
 guard. Since then the Dering family   
 have thought this window had a sacred 
 charm and during the nineteenth       
 century an eccentric descendant, Sir  
 Edward Cholmeley Dering had arched    
 windows fitted into all buildings on  
 the estate.
