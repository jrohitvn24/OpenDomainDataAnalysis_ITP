		<title>01The Domesday Survey</title>
		<content> Geologically, the area consists of    
 chalk overlain with London clay,      
 Reading Beds and Pebble Gravel.The N_S
 line of the Great North Road acts as a
 watershed between the Lea and Colne   
 riverbasins.                          
 The saxon boundary results in a third 
 of the area being in Middlesex and the
 rest in Hertfordshire. It was once    
 wooded with tracts of common land. The
 earliest known occupation was in      
 Mesolithic times. Villages developed  
 at Northaw and Potters Bar, though    
 neither was in the Domesday Day.      
 Northaw is still a small village,but  
 Little Heath developed in the         
 1880s,whilst the modern upper class   
 area of Brookmans Park encroaches on  
 the N.W. boundary.                    
 Potters Bar (pop.24,000) developed    
 since 1930 as a commuter settlement   
 for London, with some light industry. </content>
