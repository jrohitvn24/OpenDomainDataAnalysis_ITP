		<title>01NANSTALLON AND AREA</title>
		<content> Our area has scattered farms and      
 woodland and the two main places are {
{Nanstallon,}meaning valley of the{    
{River Allen,}and{Ruthern Bridge.}There
 are 3 main valleys and some steep     
 slopes.The lanes are often narrow and 
 like leafy tunnels.In summer the      
 fields,with their Cornish banks and no
 fences,are a patchwork of             
 pasture,barley and woods.There are 107
 dwellings.Most old buildings have been
 modernised.Six houses are empty,      
 including 2 tiny condemned cottages   
 next to the Post Office.Thirty eight  
 have been built in the last 18 years,3
 are being built and 2 more are        
 planned.Local councils oppose large   
 scale development,which most villagers
 do not want.Most homes are owner      
 occupied.There are still cob cottages,
 but most are built of stone and some  
 are modern concrete block houses.     </content>
