		<content> The farmers that live in this area are
 subject to a Common Market ruling     
 which forbids milk production for a   
 period of five years but this time is 
 nearly up                             
                                       
 At present most of them keep herds of 
 beef cattle which they allow to graze 
 on the grassland fattening them up    
 before selling them at the market.    
                                       
 We don't think that the farmers will  
 ever go back to dairy farming because 
 of the offers they will probably get  
 from building firms wanting to build  
 on their land.
