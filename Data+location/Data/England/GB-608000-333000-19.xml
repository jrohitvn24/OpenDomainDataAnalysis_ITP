		<title>19EDGEFIELD THEN</title>
		<content> A farmer's wife who came to Edgefield 
 when she married remembers how it was 
 20-25 years ago. "My children could   
 play in the meadows, they could pick  
 wild flowers, they loved wild straw-  
 berries. We all had our wells, lovely 
 clean water_ not like this piped      
 stuff, tasting of disinfectant. There 
 were plenty of buses, you could shop  
 anywhere, and all the tradesmen       
 delivered: there were 3 butchers and 3
 bakers delivered in the village, and  
 groceries from Holt or Melton. Now we 
 only have the newspapers, and milk    
 every other day. There was a          
 village bobby who knew everybody,and  
 the roadmen to fill in the puddles.   
 The old people used to congregate on  
 the village seat yarning. But the     
 biggest difference is not having a    
 village school: my children went to   
 the school and they had friends."     </content>
