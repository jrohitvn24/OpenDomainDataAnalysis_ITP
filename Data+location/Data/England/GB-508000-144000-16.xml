		<content> There has not always been a garage    
 here.  It used to be a cycle repair   
 workshop. The Hutchins family has been
 at the garage for fifty years. It is  
 open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mr.        
 Hutchins employs four mechanics and   
 one secretary. They repair about 40   
 cars a week. They do paint spraying   
 and M.O.T. tests. They sell new and   
 secondhand cars.  l6,000 litres of    
 Pace petrol are delivered each week   
 and stored in a tank underground.     
 There are two petrol pumps. The garage
 has one breakdown truck and it is     
 R.A.C. approved.  Birmingham is the   
 furthest they have had to go to       
 collect a car which had broken down.
