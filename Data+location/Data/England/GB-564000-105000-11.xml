		<title>11Insect life on the Marshes</title>
		<content> When we visited the marshes we were   
 fortunate enough to see several Blue  
 Damsel flies that flitted around like 
 large butterflies. Some of our friends
 have also spotted Tortoise shell,     
 Peacock and Red Admiral butterflies as
 well as the large green dragonfly. We 
 found the attractive catapillar of the
 Yellow_tail moth and also two species 
 of snails, one of which we think      
 was a White or Sandhill snail. The    
 other snail seemed to be nocturnal, we
 could not encourage it out during the 
 day but each morning there was the    
 evidence left of its long silvery     
 trail.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
