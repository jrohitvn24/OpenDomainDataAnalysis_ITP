		<title>14CHILDRENS GAMES - FOXES</title>
		<content> You need about six or seven people to 
 play this game,but you can't play it  
 with less than four.One,two or three  
 people are the foxes and the rest are 
 the chickens.The chickens have a base 
 and the foxes have a prison.However,a 
 chicken can be freed by another free  
 chicken if the free chicken  touches  
 the captive one.The fox can only stop 
 this by touching both of them.A       
 chicken cannot be freed when he is    
 outside the prison.When all the       
 chickens are caught the first one,two 
 or three chickens to be caught are    
 foxes in the next game.Sometimes      
 chickens can be freed when a free     
 chicken pretends to be caught and     
 secretly frees all the captured       
 ones.If there is only one fox,then it 
 takes quite a long time to catch the  
 chickens,but if there are more foxes  
 it takes less time.                   </content>
