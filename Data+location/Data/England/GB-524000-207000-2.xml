		<content>{THE SALISBURY ESTATE _ WOODLAND       
  The Salisbury Estate has 1,400 acres 
 of mixed woodland and 2,450 acres of  
 arable land. The trees are mainly     
 broad_leafed trees and many are       
 hundreds of years old. In one of the  
 ancient woods hornbeams have been     
 pollarded for extra wood. One tall    
 straight oak is worth one thousand    
 pounds and is highly suitable for     
 veneers (thin sheets of wood to cover 
 chipboard). Queen Elizabeth I heard   
 the news that she was queen under one 
 of the ancient oaks. Each year 7 or 8 
 acres are replanted. In 1977 the      
 Coronation Plantation of fir trees was
 planted out. Many lime trees on the   
 avenues need replacing. Mistletoe     
 likes to grow on these trees. The most
 common trees to be found on the estate
 are ash, oak, lime, hornbeam, western 
 hemlock and Scots pine.               </content>
