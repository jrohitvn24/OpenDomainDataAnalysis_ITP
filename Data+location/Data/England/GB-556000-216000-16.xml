		<title>16MARYON-WILSON FAMILY</title>
		<content> The Maryon-Wilson family has been     
 dominant in Grt Canfield from  the mid
 18C.until the present day.Sir Thomas  
 Spencer Wilson,6th Baronet of         
 Searle,Sussex,took the additional sur-
 name of Maryon in l876 when his wife  
 inherited manorial rights and holdings
 in Canfield.  Present Lord of the     
 Manor is Mrs. G.M. M-W (aged 84) widow
 of former Rector Rev. John M-W.  The  
 13th and last baronet was John's      
 brother William (died l978) who lived 
 at The Grange.  His wife Janet died   
 l985.  There were no children of      
 either marriage so the surname will   
 pass from the village on the death of 
 John's widow.  Their farm is now owned
 by kinsman John Trevelyan, married: 3 
 sons, 1 daughter.  There are memorials
 to the family in the Church.  See also
