		<title>15Games Children Play</title>
		<content>I am a nine year old boy and I live in 
Shenstone. The games children play are 
the same as they used to be but some   
are new. Rounders has been going for a 
long time. The main idea is to get     
round all four posts without being     
caught or stumped out. I asked all 29  
children in my class which games they  
liked best out of 17 games. Here they  
are in order of popularity starting    
with the favourite rounders was the    
most popular, swimming next, then      
monopoly the rest were not popular.    
Computers are new games to play with   
but you need a T.V and tape recorder.  
Board games are good to play with in   
winter or on rainy nights. Monopoly is 
a property and trading game. You try   
to get properties, and when somebody   
lands on your property they have to    
pay you rent.Chess is a game of logic  
and strategy.         SIMON KING       </content>
