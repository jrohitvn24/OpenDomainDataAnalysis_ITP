		<content>  Situated just off the A44 Evesham -  
 Oxford road, in the village of        
 Wickhamford, is the public house known
 as The Sandys Arms. The pub, which is 
 over 100 years old, takes it's name   
 from the Sandys family who once lived 
 at The Manor in Wickhamford.          
  There is a public bar and a lounge   
 where many different types of drink   
 are served, the most popular being    
 beer and wine. Customers tend to be   
 local people.                         
  Games such as crib,dominoes,cards and
 darts are played regularly, and a quiz
 competition is held on Sundays.       
  Food is served at lunch times, and in
 good weather it is possible to eat and
 drink on the lawn ouside.
