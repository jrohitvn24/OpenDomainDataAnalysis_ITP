		<content> The first farms in{Moss}date from     
 around 1700. The farms in{Fenwick     
 date from the 1800's. The houses in   
 Moss and early houses in Fenwick are  
 made from{bricks}made at the local    
 brickworks. The later houses in       
 Fenwick are made from{local stone.    
 Some farms have been modernised. One  
 farm now has got a long sitting room, 
 a middle size kitchen and a dining    
 room, upstairs it has two bedrooms and
 a bathroom with tiles on the floor and
 the walls. They have got a sunken     
 bath. To modernise the house they     
 build a{new stone wall}round the old  
 one and fasten the two together. They 
 remove walls inside the house to make 
 the rooms larger. Most of the farms   
 have open{dutch barns}and buildings,  
 such as{stables}and barns. These are  
 used as store houses today for the    
 machinery of modern farming.          </content>
