		<title>12Scouting at Hulton Park</title>
		<content>    In l959 Sir Geoffrey Hulton leased 
 27 acres of Hulton Park to Bolton     
 Scout Association. The land was       
 derelict and overgrown but in l961 a  
 start was made to create a scout camp.
 26 years later the area is more open  
 and a canteen,bunk house,sick bay and 
 warden's office have been built on the
 site of the old hall. There is a      
 special hut for handicapped campers.  
 The lake at the rear of the hall has  
 been cleared of debris and is used for
 water sports. Scouts from all over the
 country camp here. The local Guides   
 are celebrating 75 years of Guiding   
 with a special camp in August l985.   
    Wild life has returned to the park 
 in abundance and no attempt is made to
 eradicate any species; even rabbits   
 which nibble young trees are tolerated
 &amp; the cellars of the old hall make an 
 excellent sett for a badger family!   </content>
