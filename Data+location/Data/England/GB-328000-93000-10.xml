 High Wych School is partly a boarding 
 school and partly a day school.       
 Parents have to pay fees for their    
 children to attend. Some of the       
 children have been there for six      
 years. The age range is from 3 years  
 to 13 years. They like break because  
 they can do anything like climbing    
 trees, making camps and they can go   
 anywhere as long as they can hear the 
 bell.                                 
                                       
                                       
    They have two swimming pools, a big
 one, and a small one which is used by 
 the small children. The big one is    
 solar heated. They have also got      
 flippers and masks which they can use.
