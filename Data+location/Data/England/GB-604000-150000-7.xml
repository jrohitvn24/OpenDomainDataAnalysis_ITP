 This table reflects the fact that the 
 very pleasant rural area, with good   
 communications attracts a high        
 proportion of retired people, many    
 previously in professional and        
 managerial posts. The majority        
 currently employed are in middle class
 employment.                           
 The table includes women workers, a   
 high proportion of whom are married   
 and work part time.                   
 The percentage of unemployed people is
 well below the national average.      </content>
