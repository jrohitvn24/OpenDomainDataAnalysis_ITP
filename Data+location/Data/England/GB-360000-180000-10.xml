		<title>10LOCAL ISSUES IN PATCHWAY</title>
		<content> Local issues are discussed in the     
 local press and on the two local radio
 stations.None have their headquarters 
 here, but all fully cover this        
 area.                                 
  Lots of people object to the idea    
 of the{mini-town planned}for Patchway 
 Common. Savage Wood may be axed and   
 people are afraid that amenities will 
 only be built after the planners have 
 made their money. Should an aircraft  
 have an accident it may damage the    
 houses on the common. They also think 
 that the existing roads are not       
 sufficient to cope with the extra     
 traffic.In Stoke Gifford Centre for   
 Sport Limited want to{build a new     
{stadium}for Bristol Rovers. Some      
 residents think that it will be the   
 kind of amenity the area needs, others
 oppose this idea because of the       
 football violence.                    </content>
