		<title>18FOOD IN STOW</title>
		<content> There are plenty of restaurants in    
 Stow and pubs where you can eat, but  
 it is too expensive for most people to
 do very often. Quite a lot of people  
 use the fish and chip shop in Park    
 Street.                               
  Over the last few years more homes   
 have got deep-freezes and this makes  
 it easy to have all sorts of different
 and easy foods. Now micro-wave cookers
 are making life even easier. Foreign  
 holidays have given people a lot of   
 different ideas for food like pasta.  
  Even school meals are changing. Most 
 of the food comes ready  prepared,    
 even the vegetables. A typical meal is
 sausage roll, spaghetti and mashed    
 potatoes with a yoghurt or cheese and 
 biscuits to follow.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
