		<content> We found six pumps in our village.    
 They were put in by the County Council
 and later taken over by the Anglian   
 Water Board.They are about 50 years   
 old and are about one metre tall.They 
 freeze up in winter time.Their real   
 names are{stand points}because when   
 people wanted water they would go     
 and stand there with their buckets and
 turn the handle for the water to flow.
 The last one went out of use in 1984  
 in Potters Cross and was taken to     
 the Anglia Water Board, renovated and 
 placed in their reception area.       
 A man at Keysoe in north Bedfordshire 
 still uses an identical pump to       
 the ones in Wootton,and when his      
 breaks down,they have to take the     
 spare parts from the ones not used    
 in the district.The pumps have a lion 
 on them ,with its mouth open where the
 water comes out.                      </content>
