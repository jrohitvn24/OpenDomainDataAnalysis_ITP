		<content> There are two post offices in this    
 area one is in Hopton village and one 
 in Doddington.                        
 They sell food and sweets for         
 customers.But they also dispense      
 pensions, family allowances and       
 unemployment money.                   
 There is a post box by the old post   
 office where letters are collected at 
 8.55am and 4.0pm on weekdays.         
 At Doddington the post goes at 8.0am  
 and 3.45pm.                           
 The post is delivered in the morning  
 by Mrs Goode who walks on a round from
 Hopton to Doddington and Mr. Broome   
 who cycles from Hopton to Cleeton St. 
 Mary.                                 
 Most families have a phone but there  
 is a telephone kiosk in Hopton,       
 Cleeton, Crumps Brook and             
 Doddington.
