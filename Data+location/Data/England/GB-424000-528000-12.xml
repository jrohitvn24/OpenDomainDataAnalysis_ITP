		<content> Our family have lived there for two   
 and three quarter years. There are 3  
 people living in our house. We have a 
 gas fire and central heating. My      
 next door neighbour's son often plays 
 with my sister. He is called Colin. He
 is 3 years old and goes to afternoon  
 nursery at Coundon School. My sister  
 is 6 years old. She goes to Coundon   
 Infant's school and she is in Mrs.    
 Earl's class. She  sometimes plays    
 with Faye McManners from no.2.        
   The houses are made of brick and    
 have a layer of pebble dash on them. I
 like our house and I like most of the 
 people who live in the street although
 I do not know some of them. There are 
 a lot of thick bushes in our street   
 and we might be getting a nest in ours
 because we saw birds carrying straw   
 and grass in.
