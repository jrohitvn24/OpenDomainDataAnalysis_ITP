    We go to practise on Thursday.I am 
in thejuniors.There are three different
teams.The tinies are called Eccleston  
Rosebuds,the juniors are called        
Eccleston Imperials and the seniors are
called Eccleston Belvederes.There are  
about twelve in each team.All the girls
in each team have to wear the same     
dresses.The colours of Eccleston are   
pink and green.Each team must have a   
leader and may also have a mascot.     
Most weekends we go to competitions or 
carnivals in different places.We wear  
a bow in our hair and we have pink and 
white shakers.We must wear clean white 
pumps with bells and pink bows on them,
and all wear identical socks.
