		<content>The recent drainage system is part of  
the Lancashire River Board River       
Crossens Land Drainage Scheme.         
Officialy opened in 1961.It            
pumps water into the Irish Sea at      
Crossens and can maintain the water    
table at three different levels in     
three separate areas.Drainage problems 
have been made worse in the few years  
due to  increased run-off from the     
increase in built up area nearby.      
By  placeing perforated plastic pipes  
up to five foot below soil suface(depth
needed to be undisturbed by ploughing) 
water is drained away to a central     
ditch and pumped to Crossens.The crops 
grown include carrots,barley,peas and  
potatoes.These are grown in rotation   
to help preserve the condition of      
crops.Potatoes are only one year in    
six to prevent spread of potato root   
eel worm,which has reduced production. </content>
