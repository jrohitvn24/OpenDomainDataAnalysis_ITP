		<content> From our questionnaire it appears that
 many more people do non-sporting      
 hobbies than sporting probably because
 there more older people in the area   
 who are less energetic, also there are
 less facilities than in larger areas. 
 The most popular sporting hobby is    
 swimming, followed by cricket and     
 tennis. There were 17 different       
 sporting hobbies listed. The most     
 popular non-sporting hobby is         
 gardening, followed by reading and    
 walking and winemaking. There were 75 
 non-sporting hobbies listed on the    
 questionnaires. We were surprised that
 T>V> was not as popular as we expected
 it to be.
