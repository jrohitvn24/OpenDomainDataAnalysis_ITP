		<title>01Thorpe in Balne's landscape</title>
		<content>  This relatively flat area of         
 agricultural land is dominated in the 
 north-east by the six cooling towers  
 of{Thorpe Marsh}power station.To the  
 north-west the most prominant features
 are the trees of{Owston Wood}which    
 protrude into the skyline like distant
 clouds on a stormy day.Running        
 diagonally across this remote,but     
 somehow pretty corner,is the main{    
{London}to{Edinburgh}railway line,and a
 notice on a manned level crossing     
 warns that{"Trains may pass this point
{at speeds in excess of 100 miles per  
{hour"}!                               
  In the south-west corner the largest 
 object to be seen is the newly        
 landscaped tip of{Bentley Colliery}   
 which rolls down to the edge of{Toll  
{Bar}village.Again most noticeable in  
 the south-east of the region is the   
 bulk of the power station.            </content>
