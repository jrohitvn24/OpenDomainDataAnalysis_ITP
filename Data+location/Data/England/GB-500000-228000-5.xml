		<content> The{Baptist}Church, situated near the 
 cemetry, was built in 1885. An annexe 
 completed in 1984 is a Sunday School  
 and Youth Club. An important feature  
 of the Baptist faith is the Baptistry.
 The Baptistry here, is actually       
 beneath a moveable pulpit. The{       
{Catholic}Church, near Parkfields      
 School, was converted in 1959 from old
 stables. In the same year the Church  
 house and grounds were donated to the 
 Diocese of Northampton. There is not a
 resident priest, but one from the     
 Order of Vincentians in Dunstable says
 Mass. The{Methodist}Church, in the    
 centre of the village, is 189 years   
 old. It has an original graveyard     
 which is not now used as the dead are 
 buried in the Inter-Denominational{   
{Cemetry}in the village. The Church has
 a preacher who lives in Toddington and
 a mainly local congregation.          </content>
