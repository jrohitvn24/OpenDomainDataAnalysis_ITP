		<content>  The river has, in recent years, been 
 made navigable (by use of locks) as   
 far as Stratford on Avon. This has    
 significantly increased the traffic   
 upon the river and narrow boats (and  
 other types of crafts) are frequent   
 visitors in the Summer. A Marina now  
 exists on the Offenham side of Evesham
 where boats can be hired and repairs  
 undertaken.' The Bridge' at Offenham  
 now caters for these holiday visitors 
 who can be in considerable numbers    
 during the Summer.                    
  Fishing has always been a popular    
 sport on the Avon and a local club    
 exists to promote the sport. Many     
 angling clubs from other areas also   
 visit the river in Evesham. The main  
 fish caught are Chub,Perch,Gudgeon and
 Elvers.
