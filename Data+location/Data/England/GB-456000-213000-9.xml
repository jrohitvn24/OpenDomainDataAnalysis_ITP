		<title>09A FARMER'S YEAR (1)</title>
		<content>Many of the farmers use the moor in a  
similar way.Mrs Bagnall told us the    
pattern of her farming year.           
JANUARY:Most of the time is spent      
feeding the cattle with hay or straw.  
They have to stay in the Barn because  
it is very cold and they don't like    
being outside.                         
FEBRUARY:Once again much of the time is
spent feeding the cattle.The farmers   
have to keep the machinery in working  
order because it wouldn't be very good 
if the machinery didn't work when it   
was needed.                            
MARCH:The cornfields are fertilized so 
that they will give better crops.The   
crop is sprayed with pesticides to kill
the bugs.Spring corn is planted ready  
to be harvested in July or August.     
APRIL:Potatoes are planted ready for   
harvest in late September.The lambs are
born.The grass is fertilized.          </content>
