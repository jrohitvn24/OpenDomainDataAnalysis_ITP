		<title>07Features of Old St.Leonard's</title>
		<content> Of historical interest are a number of
 James Burton's early developments.    
 Facing the sea is Burton's original   
 Regency home,Crown House,where the    
 Princess Victoria once stayed and to  
 the East the impressive Royal Victoria
 Hotel behind which lies the Assembly  
 Hall.To the rear,approached through   
 the archway of South Lodge,are        
 St.Leonard's Gardens.Originally a     
 subscription garden it is now open to 
 the public,providing an area of peace 
 and tranquillity.Along the Gardens'   
 eastern perimeter path lies a border  
 of aromatic plants,each having a      
 Braille nameplate for the benefit of  
 the blind.Leaving the Gardens through 
 the archway of North Lodge you come to
 the later residential area of         
 St.Leonard's with its fine range of   
 stone built Victorian houses and      
 cottages which include Clock House.   </content>
