		<title>13Children in School</title>
		<content>Children at school have lots of fun    
doing lots of things like              
painting,drawing,writing and modelling.
At break time and lunch break children 
play together.Some of the children in  
school are rough some are kind and not 
so rough.We also do swimming and gym.  
They also do work on the               
computer,maths,and topic like The Civil
War.Also they read and write           
stories,and the library van comes once 
a term.We also have exhibits from the  
museum,like an otter.We have our own   
swimming pool.We also have a P.E. hall.
Children take Proficiency tests,       
B.A.G.A awards and A.S.A swimming      
tests.On sports day the juniors divide 
into 3 houses, Langtree, Iknield,      
D,Oyley.Sometimes we do plays for the  
school and sometimes we have vistors.
