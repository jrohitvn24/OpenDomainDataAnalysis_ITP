		<content> MR STAINTHORP IS 83 YEARS OLD AND CAME
 TO TANFIELD IN 1918. HE TOLD US THAT  
 THE ROADS WERE JUST GRAVEL AND SOIL IN
 THOSE DAYS.  EVENTUALLY THE HEADMASTER
 COMPLAINED ABOUT THE DUSTY CONDITIONS.
 MR STAINTHORP WORKED AT THE THE GRANGE
 AND LIVED THERE UNTIL HE GOT MARRIED. 
 HE  STARTED WORK AT 5.30AM. BY FEEDING
 THE CATTLE AND HORSES, THEN HE WOULD  
 HAVE BREAKFAST OF COLD BACON, A ROLL  
 AND HALF A TEA-CAKE, THEN HE WOULD    
 PLOUGH THE FIELDS.  IT COULD TAKE HIM 
 A WHOLE DAY TO PLOUGH AN ACRE.        
 IN THE MORNING, A TRAIN WOULD GO FROM 
 TANFIELD TO RIPON,MAKING SEVERAL      
 JOURNIES.  CHILDREN CAUGHT THE TRAIN  
 AT 7.00AM. TO GO TO SCHOOL IN RIPON.  
 MOST PEOPLE OWNED A PONY AND TRAP OR  
 BICYCLE. THERE WERE SEVERAL SHOPS IN  
 THE VILLAGE, INCLUDING A              
 TAILOR;COBBLER;GROCER;BOOTMAKER AND   
 BUTCHER.                              </content>
