		<title>14RECREATION IN HIGHAM FERRERS</title>
		<content>In Higham Ferrers there is a general   
feeling that there is not enough       
recreational facilities available for  
people of any age.                     
                                       
In Higham Ferrers there are two Pubs, a
park, a good library and two Youth     
Clubs. In Chelveston and Caldecott     
there is only a Pub. People from these 
villages have to visit other places for
their recreation, which can be a       
problem as there is no regular bus     
service.                               
                                       
The Ferrers School offers recreational 
facilities to young people. There are  
disco's for pupils, a Youth Club and a 
Pop-In where young people can pop-in   
for a chat and a drink with their      
friends.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
