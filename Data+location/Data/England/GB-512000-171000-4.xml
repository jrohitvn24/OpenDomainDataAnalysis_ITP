		<title>04POPULATION OF WHITTON</title>
		<content> We did a survey to find out the age   
 groups living in Whitton. Our results 
 showed the following:                 
 1st...35-55 years old..........35%    
 2nd...under 18 years old.......30%    
 3rd...18-35 years old..........21%    
 4th...55-70 years old...........8%    
 5th...over 70 years old.........6%    
 This shows that most of the people are
 probably families with children. There
 are not many old people living in     
 Whitton. Most of these people choose  
 to live in Whitton and have lived here
 between 10-40 years. People who have  
 lived in Whitton liked to stay there. 
 Some of the reasons that Whitton is   
 popular are that it is near to London 
 and has good shopping facilities.     
 Although a big disadvantage is the    
 continual noise from planes going into
 Heathrow Airport.
