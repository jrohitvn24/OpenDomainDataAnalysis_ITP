		<content>  Bellingham used to have a castle     
 which existed in the twelfth          
 century.De Bellinghams lived in the   
{castle.}All that is left is a green   
 mound near the Hareshaw Burn.         
  In later years the border areas of   
 England and Scotland were quite       
 dangerous places to live. There were  
 many family feuds with parties if     
 raiders or{reivers}as they were known 
 going out to steal and plunder other  
 peoples property and livestock.       
 Farmhouses were made with strong walls
 and slits to spy or shoot through.    
  At the Hole farm there is a good     
 example of a{fortified farmhouse}or   
{bastle.}Some changes have been made   
 but you can see where the family lived
 upstairs with the animals below.The   
 hole for climbing through can still be
 seen. The farmer uses the lower part  
 of the building for cattle.           </content>
