		<content> Weston Lullingfield was until 1857    
 part of the parish of Baschurch.   In 
 that year a church was opened and     
 Weston Lullingfield became a parish on
 its own.   The church had seating for 
 150 and was dedicated to the Holy     
 Trinity.  A clock was put up in 1897  
 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond 
 Jubilee.   There was a Methodist      
 Chapel at Weston Common, built about  
 1851.   This has now been demolished. 
 Since 1982, the parish has been       
 united with the parishes of Baschurch 
 and Hordley.  Together, they cover    
 about 30 square miles.   The church is
 built of sandstone, comprising nave,  
 chancel and roof spire in its own     
 burial ground.
