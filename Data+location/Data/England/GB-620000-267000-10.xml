		<title>10Worlingworth May Day 1985</title>
		<content>The village May Day fete was regarded  
by all concerned as a very pleasing    
occasion.The entertainments included   
various games of skill or chance       
offering prizes of wine,goldfish &amp;     
teddy bears.A suitcase circus          
performed &amp; a very precise model of a  
stationary steam engine,made by a      
villager was driving a model elevator  
known locally as a "pitcher".Races     
were run,a pet show was held,a large   
inflatable plastic envelope was        
bounced upon by the children &amp; wooden  
balls were thrown at coconuts.The      
Brownies entertained with traditional  
maypole dancing,twisting coloured      
ribbons about a vertical post.         
The occasion raised 583.58 pounds for  
Worlingworth Community Council funds.
