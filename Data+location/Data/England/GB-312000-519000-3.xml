		<title>03LOWESWATER LAKE.</title>
		<content> Loweswater Lake is 1.8km long with a  
 maximum depth of 16m and a volume of  
 5.4 million cu.m. It is not directly  
 used for water supply, but discharges 
 into Crummock (ref. page 2).          
 Loweswater is owned by the National   
 Trust who issue fishing permits for   
 Â£2.00 per day obtainable from Scale   
 Hill Hotel. Rowing boats can also be  
 hired for Â£10.00 per day.Car park     
 facilities are available for fishermen
 &amp; boat users close to an area known as
 Swans Nest where the boats are kept.  
 The N.T. stocks the lake with Trout,  
 the Water Authority with Salmon but   
 Pike &amp; Char occur naturally. The area 
 around Loweswater is of great natural 
 beauty and attracts many tourists,    
 principally fell walkers. Use of the  
 manyfootpaths and rights of way being 
 perhaps, the best way of appreciating 
 the scenery.                          </content>
