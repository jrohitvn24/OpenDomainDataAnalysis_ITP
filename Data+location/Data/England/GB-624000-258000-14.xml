		<title>14Shopping. Hoo area.</title>
		<content> Kettleburgh &amp; Brandeston,the 2 large  
villages in the area,both have a combi-
ned Post Office &amp; shop.                
 In Kettleburgh it is a well-stocked   
store where many people from the surr- 
ounding area buy a complete weeks      
supply of food.The Brandeston shop     
supplies the essentials on a smaller   
scale.                                 
 Because bus services are poor most    
families have their own transport,enab-
ling them to shop further afield at    
more competitive prices.               
 Brandeston people tend to travel to   
Framlingham and the once a week bus    
service makes it a social occasion par-
ticularly for the elderly.Because the  
bus from Kettleburgh goes to Wickham   
Mkt,it is there that the locals shop.  
 There is a travelling fishmonger and  
milk is delivered.
