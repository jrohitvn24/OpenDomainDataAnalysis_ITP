		<title>13Names in Cromford</title>
		<content>  We have found out about the most     
{popular names}of children in          
 Cromford. We went round all the       
 classes in our school.We found the    
 four{most popular}boys' names. Simon  
 and David came joint top and then Gary
 and Andrew came joint 2nd.For the     
 girls Deborah came top then Sarah     
 followed by Julie and then Louise.We  
 wanted to find out why these names    
 were the most popular.Some children   
 were named after relatives and others 
 given names that their parents like   
 the sound of.
