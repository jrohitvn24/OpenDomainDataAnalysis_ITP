		<content> Mr. Sharp is a dairy farmer.He has 250
 cows.He lives at Winchhill Farm.He has
 some chickens,a dog and 2 cats. Mr.   
 Sharp milks the cows twice a day.They 
 stand in the same place in the milking
 parlour every time.He has places for  
 10 cows to be milked at once.The      
 milk is collected in a tanker and     
 taken to Wallace Brothers Dairy in    
 Hitchin.                              
 In the summer the cows stay in the    
 fields,but in the winter they stay in 
 the barn.The cows make many           
 tons of manure a year.He sells it to  
 people in Breachwood Green.My dad had 
 half a cart full and he put it on the 
 soft fruit and roses to make them grow
 better.
