		<title>12LAND AROUND THE RIVER FROME</title>
		<content> There is low land around many areas of
 the{R.Frome.}It is crossed by many    
 streams and is wet all year round.    
 This land is mainly used for cattle   
 grazing but some cereal crops are     
 grown on the higher land.             
   The land to the south and west is   
 owned by Duddle Farm and the land to  
 the north and east is owned by Norris 
 Mill Farm.                            
   Duddle Farm comprises of a large    
 Georgian house and a few small farm   
 buildings including a large metal     
 barn.                                 
   At the Bockhampton crossroads the   
 Bockhampton road crosses the          
 Dorchester-Tincleton road.            
   The land rises in a NW direction    
 putting the road from{Lower           
{Bockhampton}to{Higher Bockhampton}on a
 significant slope.
