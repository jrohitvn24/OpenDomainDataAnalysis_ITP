		<title>11THE M6 MOTORWAY _ PART I</title>
		<content> The{Golden Fleece}interchange on the  
 M6 motorway is in the NE corner of our
 12 Km block.Carlisle is on the major  
 route to Scotland where the gap       
 narrows between the Solway Firth and  
 the Pennines.For many years it has    
 been a bottle_neck for traffic and a  
 by_pass was proposed as early as the  
 1930's but the war intervened and     
 nothing more was done until 1960 when 
 a traffic survey was done by the      
 County Highways Dept.In 1962 the      
 Ministry of Transport decided that the
 motorway network would finish just    
 north of Carlisle.17 lines were       
 considered at first and these were    
 reduced to 4,all east of the city.The 
 final choice was from the{Golden      
{Fleece}to{Greymoorhill.}The Golden    
 Fleece interchange is a 2_level one   
 with connections to the A6,Wetheral   
 (eastwards)and Durdar(westwards).     </content>
