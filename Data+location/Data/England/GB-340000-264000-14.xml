		<title>14WOODS AROUND AYMESTREY-FLORA</title>
		<content>   There are some privately owned areas
 of mixed deciduous woodland in the    
 district but most of the larger areas 
 belong to the{Forestry Commission}and 
 these are predominately coniferous.   
 Here the trees are:{SCOTS PINE,}can be
 harvested after 50 yrs and grows to   
 height of 80ft;{SESSILE OAK,}planted  
 in  24yd strips between the pines;    
{JAPANESE LARCH,}planted on edge of    
 forest, and also a few self seeded    
 SILVER BIRCH and a few BEECH.         
   The acid soil under the trees only  
 supports Foxglove and Bracken and some
 varieties of Fern  but in Spring,     
 before the canopy casts its shade grow
 Daffodil,Bluebell,Violet and primrose.
 Broom, Mallow, Rose-bay Willow Herb,  
 and Ragged Robin grow on the edges of 
 the forest. Blackberries,Raspberries  
 Bilberries &amp; a wide variety of lichens
 &amp; moss are found on forest track banks</content>
