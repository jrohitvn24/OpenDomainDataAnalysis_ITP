		<content>{    MR. COLE'S DAY                    
  My dad gets up at 7.00a.m. and at    
 7.20 he drives by car to Hinkley      
 Point.He has to walk through a turn   
 stile to get inside. He changes into  
 his working clothes and with his bag  
 of tools goes to the turbine hall to  
 mend the machines. The machines are   
 very big and weigh about 50           
 elephants.At about 10.00 he stops for 
 a cup of tea. Then he works until     
 12.30. when he has his sandwiches,    
 cheese is his favourite. In the       
 afternoon he carries on mending the   
 machines using the crane for heavy    
 things. At about 4.30 he gets washed  
 and changed and goes home for tea.    
 After tea he does some decorating.    
 About 9.00 he has a cup of coffee and 
 watches television then at 11.00 he   
 goes to bed. {by HAYLEY COLES.
