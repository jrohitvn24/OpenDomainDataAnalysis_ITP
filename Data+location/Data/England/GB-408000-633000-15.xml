		<content> Mrs Lesley Smith is the Community     
 Visitor in Belford this year.If Social
 Service funds are still available     
 somebody else will be appointed next  
 year.She visits 16 people at the      
 moment,some living outside Belford at 
 Mousen and Middleton,so a car is      
 essential.Most people she visits are  
 housebound so she shops for them,     
 collects pensions and calls the doctor
 in if necessary.                      
 Belford has a Meals on Wheels service.
 The lunches are prepared in Bell View 
 Old People's Home and are delivered by
 unpaid volunteers.There are also about
 7 Home Helps who cover a large area   
 surrounding the village.              
 A chiropodist visits a centre in the  
 village once a month.The patients are 
 seen every 3 months.Those who are     
 housebound are visited in their own   
 homes.                                </content>
