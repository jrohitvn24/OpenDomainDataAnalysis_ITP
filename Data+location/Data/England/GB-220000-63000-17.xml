		<content>  HARVEST FESTIVALS ARE A GREAT        
 INSTITUTION IN THE AREA. WITH FARMING 
 AS THE MAJOR EMPLOYMENT, HARVEST TAKES
 ON GREAT SIGNIFICANCE. EACH CHAPEL AND
 CHURCH HAS THEIR OWN SERVICE TO WHICH 
 MANY PEOPLE GO. THIS PUTS A STRAIN ON 
 THE LOCAL CLERGY WHO MAY HAVE TO      
 PRODUCE SEVERAL DIFFERENT HARVEST     
 ADDRESSES. THEIR DIGESTIONS ARE ALSO  
 STRAINED BY OVEREATING AT THE VARIOUS 
 HARVEST TEAS.                         
  IN THE METHODIST CHAPELS THERE IS A  
 SUNDAY CELEBRATION, AND A MIDWEEK     
 SERVICE FOLLO2ED BY A SUPPER AND OFTEN
 AN AUCTION OF PRODUCE. THESE OCCASIONS
 SATISFY BOTH A RELIGIOUS AND A SOCIAL 
 NEED.                                 
  OTHER MAJOR FESTIVALS ARE THE SUNDAY 
 SCHOOL AND CHAPEL ANNIVERSARIES. THERE
 ARE SUNDAY SCHOOLS AT BOTH DOBWALLS   
 AND TREVELMOND.
