		<title>14Kington :Road Transport</title>
		<content>  Kington has no rail transport but it 
 is well served by buses. The companies
 running buses through Kington are     
 Sargeants (based on Kington), Primrose
 and Canyon. These buses bring people  
 from the surrounding countryside into 
 Kington and take people to Hereford,  
 Leominster, Llandrindod and Hay.      
 Kington has great traffic problems. It
 has very narrow streets where vans and
 lorries stop to load and unload at    
 shops. In the morning esp when the    
 school buses are going through Kington
 traffic can come to a standstill when 
 buses and lorries meet. Buses often   
 have to go onto the pavement and      
 lorries have to park close to shop    
 windows. There have been several minor
 accidents. In 1982 a by-pass was      
 opened to take heavy vehicles round   
 the town, esp those from the two      
 quarries just west of Kington.        </content>
