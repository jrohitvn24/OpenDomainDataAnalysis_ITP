		<content>      Many thousands of people use     
 Stokes Bay for a number of different  
 leisure pursuits.  There are guide    
 lines all along the coast for         
 launching sailbords in several        
 designated areas, access to both the  
 slipways and car parks are easy.      
      Swimmers too are catered for. But
 bathing is not advised within the     
 sailboard areas and so parts of the   
 beach have been designated for        
 swimming only.                        
      There are numerous car parks and 
 in the summer months Stokes Bay  is   
 very popular. There are several bus   
 services which connect Stokes Bay to  
 Gosport and Lee-on-Solent.            
      In addition to swimming and      
 sailing there are tennis              
 courts,putting green,bowls and a      
 childrens paddling pool.
