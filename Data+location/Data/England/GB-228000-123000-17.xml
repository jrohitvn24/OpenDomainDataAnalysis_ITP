		<title>17Hopes for the future</title>
		<content> Local people were asked for their     
 hopes  &amp; wishes for the future.       
 Some of their replies were:-          
 ....."That local people would look    
 after their vegetable gardens better. 
 .....That local people would like the 
 holiday makers more...That Clovelly   
 was quieter...That there were more    
 indoor facilities...For every one to  
 live in a more peaceful world...That  
 Clovelly stays as it is ...I could    
 have more money...I could have my life
 the same all over again...The lifeboat
 will stay here...Clovelly had more    
 public toilets...Clovelly stays the   
 same but I do hope that each cottage  
 will have a bathroom &amp; inside toilet. 
 ..Quicker access to motorways...Local 
 people would travel &amp; widen their     
 horizons....Youngsters would be more  
 ambitious &amp; adventurous...For more    
 jobs &amp; career opportunities."         </content>
