		<title>05A WALK THROUGH HOLTON.</title>
		<content> Holton is a peaceful village.It has   
recently had several new buildings     
built though there are still some      
lovely old houses.One of these is the  
old school house which we visited.     
  In the old school house there lives  
an artist,his wife and his children.His
wife told us that there used to be     
just two rooms.One for the older       
children and one for the younger.The   
older childrens room had a huge fire   
place with bars in front of it and the 
children used to put their bottles of  
milk between the bars to warm.         
  It is now a house and it has had     
stairs built to create an upstairs     
studio.It still looks old outside and  
they have tried to preserve as much of 
the original interior as possible.     
There are lots of paintings on the     
walls.                                 
                                       </content>
