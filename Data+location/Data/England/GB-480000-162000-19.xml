		<title>19Housing and Housing Costs.</title>
		<content>  The majority of the housing in the   
 area is privately owned, although     
 there is a small Council Estate.  The 
 general development has been small,   
 private estates radiating out from the
 original village roads.  Some of this 
 development, including the re-sited   
 Primary School, has been on land      
 originally owned by {Wellington       
{College.}                             
  The general feeling of the residents 
 is probably best summed up by Jayne   
 (aged 10):-                           
 "....not many people move out of      
 Little Sandhurst because they like it 
 so much. We have lived here two years 
 and like it a lot. Little Sandhurst is
 an interesting, serene place to live."
