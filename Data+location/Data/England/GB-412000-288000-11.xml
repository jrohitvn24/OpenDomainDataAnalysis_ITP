		<content>A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LOUISE.           
I woke up at 9a.m.,got up,had a wash   
and dressed myself.I went down,had my  
breakfast and watched TV.At 11a.m. I   
went to call for my friend,Dawn.We went
to the shops for my mom.My sister's    
boyfriend set up his tent in our back  
garden so mum said we could have lunch 
in it.Afterwards we went for a bike    
ride and went to Dawn's house until    
teatime . I went back for Dawn and we  
took turns to play on my bike.At 8p.m. 
we went in and Dawn's mother gave me a 
packet of Hula Hoops and some Rolos.We 
listened to some George Michael records
as Dawn loves him.At 9.00p.m.I had to  
go home.I watched TV.for a while before
going to bed as I was so tired.My small
brother aged 3 was still up when I went
to bed playing with his toys.My sister 
was in the kitchen with her friends    
listening to some tapes.               </content>
