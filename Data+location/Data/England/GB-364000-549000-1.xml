		<title>01Knarsdale Common</title>
		<content> Knarsdale Common rises to south and   
 west towards highest peaks of the     
 North Pennines. Knar Burn cuts a deep 
 valley North to South through the     
 centre of the common. Towards the     
 south east Thornhope Fell rises to    
 540m. The extreme east of the block   
 comprises the western slopes of the   
 South Tyne valley. The north east and 
 central northern parts of the block   
 contain meadow land and hayfields with
 scattered farms. Outside the valleys, 
 vegetation consists of rough grass,   
 heather and bracken with rushes and   
 cottongrass in the wetlands. The      
 population of the block is            
 approximately 20, all farm families.  
 The uplands are extensively grazed by 
 sheep. The only trees are in the      
 cloughs and valley bottoms.
