		<title>17HALE LIBRARY AND RECREATION.</title>
		<content>   The{library}in Hale is a popular    
 meeting place, built in 1966 with an  
 extension opened in l974 it is        
 situated in the housing and shopping  
 area and consequently is well used.   
 Access to the library for people in   
 wheel chairs was found to be good. The
 survey group were able to find a great
 deal of information on local clubs and
 societies and the display area in the 
 foyer is well used throughout the year
 by such groups as the{Scouts and      
{Guides}and local artists. Of note is  
 the Guide camp site in Ashley and the 
{Hale Ornithologists}which are well    
 known in South Manchester. Such       
 societies reflect the rural and       
 wealthier nature of the area. The many
 stables in the area, for example,     
 makes{horse riding}a popular form of  
 recreation.
