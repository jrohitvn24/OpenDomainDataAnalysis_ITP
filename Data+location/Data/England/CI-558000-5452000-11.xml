		<title>11Market Gardening, St Ouen</title>
		<content>  My dad has a field near to St Ouen's 
 Manor in which he grows courgettes.   
 The names of the seeds vary,          
 Ambassador and President are the kinds
 we use on our land. We buy the seed   
 from a seed merchant for Â£30 a tin. We
 planted the seeds on 25th June.  To   
 get rid of wees we use weedkiller. You
 can see the green foliage appearing   
 after 10 days. We have 6 vegees (2.6  
 acres) of courgettes at the moment and
 we pick them by hand from the end of  
 August to November. You have to have  
 long sleeves to pick them because they
 prick you. Class one courgettes must  
 not be curved. Class two are slightly 
 curved, class three are large and     
 curved.  They are packed in tomato    
 trays which have paper lids and are   
 stamped with our own licence number.  
 They are sent to Portsmouth in        
 refrigerated lorries.                 </content>
