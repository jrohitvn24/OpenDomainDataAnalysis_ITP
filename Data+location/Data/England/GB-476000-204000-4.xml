		<content> The few survivors emigrated to High   
 Wycombe where the furniture trade     
 needed new workers, and left their    
 town to disappear into the fields and 
 hedgerows, leaving little trace.      
 In Ilmer there are two horticulture   
 businesses, one a nursery garden      
 selling thousands of christmas trees  
 and the other, together with its      
 poultry farm, selling direct to the   
 public.                               
 The travelling library visits Ilmer   
 once a fortnight.   The children all  
 have to travel by special bus to      
 school.                               
 The social highlight of the year is   
 the Church Fete on Spring Bank holiday
 monday, when many "outsiders" visit to
 join in the fun.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
