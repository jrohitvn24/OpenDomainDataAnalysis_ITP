 The Mill at Ramsey,is one of the most 
 dominant features,and is an           
 interesting piece of{local history.   
 As you would expect it is situated at 
 the top of the hill,and can be seen   
 from all angles.Originally Ramsey had 
 no mill,but did have a{bakery}of it's 
 own.                                  
 In 1842,Mr.J.Brook purchased a mill   
 from Woodbridge in Suffolk(which had  
 two),and had it brought to the        
 village.It was used for almost 100    
 years after this,and only fell into   
 dis-use at the start of the War in    
 1939.                                 
 In 1973 the present owner bought      
 it,and saved it from collapse.It has  
 been repaired with set sails;any      
 visitors are asked to call at Mill    
 house,before proceeding.              </content>
