		<content>{Richmond}in{North Yorkshire}is the    
 mother of all the towns (70) of this  
 name worldwide. Many tourists arrive  
 in the town every year, drawn by the  
 great scenic beauty of the surrounding
 countryside and by its cobbled market 
 place and historic buildings.         
  The{River Swale}( its name means a   
 tumultuous flow) is the fastest       
 flowing river in{England}. At the foot
 of the{Castle}there is a natural drop 
 in the river bed making a 6ft water-  
 fall. The large flat grassy field     
 nearby, known as the{Batts}, attracts 
 hundreds of picnickers and paddlers.  
  The{Swale}is an anglers river. There 
 are trout above  and coarse fish below
 the falls.  Over the{Green Bridge     
 below{Earls Orchard}there is a sports 
 and leisure field and modern pavilion.
 This was once a jousting ground for   
 knights from the{Castle}. (continued) </content>
