		<title>02Village School Headteacher</title>
		<content>                                       
Most of the headteacher's time is      
spent on teaching.                     
If he was working as headteacher in a  
town school, time would be used in     
other ways. In a village school though 
the headteacher has to do all that kind
of work in his spare time.             
The headteacher doesn't think he gets  
paid enough and would go on strike if  
his union asked him to.                
He says that the children in town      
schools tend to fight more than in     
village schools and that children in   
the country are more friendly towards  
each other. The crazes are the same.   
His worries are on a much wider scale  
than a normal teacher but he has the   
power to improve the school and to     
change something he doesn't like.
