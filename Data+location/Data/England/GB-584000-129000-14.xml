		<title>14Rolvenden's Korker Sausages</title>
		<content>   Each day vans carry the name of{    
{Rolvenden's Kent Korker Sausages}to   
 shops in the South and the Midlands   
 from Jim Hoad's factory in Rolvenden. 
   Mr. Hoad specialised in making pork 
 sausages in the 1970's when he noticed
 that with the growth of supermarkets  
 fewer people bought all their meat at 
 his two village butcher's shops.      
   The small factory employs 16 people 
 who make over 50,000 sausages a day.  
 The sausages are made from pork,      
 cereal binder, salt, pepper and sage. 
 90% of the sausages made are frozen   
 in the factory and taken in insulated 
 vans to be sold in their frozen state.
   The factory also makes "porkburgers"
 and pre-packed meat products. Mr. Hoad
 expects that in the future he will be 
 making more "fast food" products as   
 microwave cooking becomes more popular
 with busy housewives.                 </content>
