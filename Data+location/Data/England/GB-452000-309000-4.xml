		<title>04A TRIP TO BRADGATE PARK.</title>
		<content> On Wednesday we went to Bradgate Park.
 I had my boots, ruck sack and my blue 
 Kagoule.  We started at 10am.         
 We went across the fields and got to  
 the park at about 11am.               
 We saw the Park Ranger and he told us 
 about the deer.  The red deer and the 
 fallow deer and the special white     
 deer.  We went to his car and he gave 
 us a fallow deer antler.  We went into
 the ruins where Craig found a peacocks
 egg. We went into the chapel.  The    
 ranger told us about Lady Jane Grey,  
 she had freckles.                     
 We had our packed lunches and then we 
 played a game of football.  Some of us
 went to the monument of Old John and  
 the rest went to the village of       
 Newtown Linford.  We got backto school
 at about 5 minutes to four.
