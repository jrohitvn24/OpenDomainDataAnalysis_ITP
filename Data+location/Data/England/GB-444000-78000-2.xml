		<content> At the beginning of the last century  
 and earlier this stretch of coast was 
 nortorious for shipwrecks,wrecking and
 smuggling.In the latter case,smugglers
 landed kegs of brandy from Barfleur,in
 France,at the chines and carried them 
 inland to Compton,Mottistone,         
 Brighstone,Shorwell and Chale.One well
 trodden smuggler's route inland to    
{Brighstone}was from{Atherfield through
{Sutton and Thorncross,emerging at the 
{top of Mead Lane.}Ships wrecked on    
 this coast may be numbered in hundreds
 During England's naval engagement     
 against the Spanish Armada,in which   
 the island was the enemy's prime      
 target for invasion,a Spanish galleon 
 was wrecked in Chale Bay and much     
 later gold coins from it's cargo were 
 found on the beach.
