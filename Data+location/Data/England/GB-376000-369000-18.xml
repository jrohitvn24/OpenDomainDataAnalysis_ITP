		<content> The Nuffield radio astronomy          
 laboratories form part of the Physics 
 department of Manchester University.  
 The director is Professor F. Graham   
 Smith, who took over in 1982 from the 
 founding director, Professor Sir      
 Bernard Lovell.                       
                                       
 The staff consists of two Professors, 
 a Reader and 13 lecturers. The        
 Engineering, Technical and Admin staff
 plus research fellows and students    
 bring the total complement to 130+.   
                                       
 The Academic staff divide their time  
 between research and teaching.        
 Undergraduate teaching takes place in 
 the University. A Postgraduate course 
 for an M.Sc. or Diploma Of Advanced   
 Studies in Science (DASS) is held at  
 Jodrell Bank. Suitable students may   
 then pursue research for a Ph.D.      </content>
