 every hour and a bus service to       
 Weston_super_Mare.The amenities in the

 Sir William Miles used to own the     
 Manor House and some land around      
 it.The main transport through the     
 village is the motor car.It can be    
 very congested around the centre of   
 the village because of parked cars.
