<title>23River Wharfe at Tadcaster</title>
<content>

Flood banks were raised about five years ago. There has been no serious flooding here since 2000.

Walks along the river banks and over the viaduct are popular and a duck race organised by the the swimming pool volunteers is well attended.   &lt;br />
