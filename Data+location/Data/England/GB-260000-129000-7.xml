		<content>    The school was built in 1866 with  
 an additional classroom added in 1929.
 Prior to this lessons were held in the
 'Old Schoolroom' adjacent to the      
 church still used for church and other
 activities.                           
    Children from 5-11 are admitted and
 there are close links with the village
 playgroup, the Church ( the school has
 a church 'aided' status), and three   
 other local schools.                  
   The school is organised into three  
 classes according to age with an      
 average of 25 children in each. In    
 1981 there were 36 children on roll;  
 later this year (1985) there will be  
 80.                                   
   Meals are cooked on the premises and
 children go to the Barnstaple Leisure 
 Centre for swimming instruction each  
 week. The Jubilee Hall is used each   
 week for Country Dancing and P.E.     </content>
