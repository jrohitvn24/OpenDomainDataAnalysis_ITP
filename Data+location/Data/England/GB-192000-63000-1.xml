   This area of land slopes gently to  
 the south and west.The shallow sided  
 valleys and flat valley bottoms are   
 covered with various shades of green. 
{Small fields}descend to the streams   
 and river head waters and there is    
 much wet land.                        
  Man has had a great impact on this   
 landscape in the way he has created   
 the fields and left a few copses of   
{older woodland.}The narrow steep sided
 lanes make it difficult for vehicles  
 to pass and once off the Secondary    
 roads it is vital to proceed          
 carefully.                            
  Beef and dairy farms predominate.    
 Even in{Tregonetha village}most home  
 owners have some land.There is also a 
 small{village green.}With no shops and
 only the school buses,people need     
 their own form of transport.          </content>
