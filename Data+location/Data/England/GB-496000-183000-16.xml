		<content> There is one private school and seven 
 state schools in our area. There is no
 Secondary Education here but children 
 travel to nearby Secondary Moderns or 
 Grammars.{Buckinghamshire is one of   
{the few areas in the country to still 
{operate a selective system of         
{education.}At 12 they sit an entrance 
 examination for a grammar school. If  
 they don't pass they have to go to a  
 Secondary Modern. Many children in the
 area do not use the State or Free     
 Education. They travel to{Private     
 schools in Gerrards Cross and         
 Beaconsfield.                         
  I am at a Private school in Gerrard's
 Cross. Some of my friends board as    
 their parents work abroad. At 12 we   
 sit a Common Entrance examination for 
 entry to our next school. The fees for
 a Day Girl are Â£650 per term.
