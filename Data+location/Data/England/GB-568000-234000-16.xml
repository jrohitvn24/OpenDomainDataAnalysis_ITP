		<title>16FARMING.</title>
		<content> Farming is the main industry in this  
 area.It has become highly mechanized  
 over recent years with the result that
 far fewer men are employed. Intensive 
 farming means widespread use of sprays
 and fertilisers.Many farmers feel this
 is overdone,causing overproduction of 
 cereal crops,and some feel a quota    
 should be set.There is still a great  
 need for small farms,especially tenant
 farms,since there are at the moment   
 few openings for young people.        
 Most farmers accept E.E.C. farming    
 policies with reservations,feeling    
 that there is much bad management of  
 resources, with little consideration  
 for small farmers.                    
 The majority of farmers in this area  
 are conservationists,retaining hedges 
 where practicable and planting trees. 
 Stubble burning is on the decline due 
 to national outcry.                   </content>
