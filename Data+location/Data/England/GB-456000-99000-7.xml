		<title>07THE GOLF COURSE,LEE.</title>
		<content>    Lee-on-the-Solent Golf Course      
 covers an area of approximately two   
 square kilometres and is a veritable  
 oasis of greenery.It is surrounded    
 mainly by agricultural land and       
 grazing land.It is difficult to       
 realise that there are housing estates
 very close at hand when all around are
 panoramic views of typically Southern 
 English countryside.A public footpath 
 meanders through the golf course      
 providing a very pleasant walk through
 open spaces,although one has to be    
 aware of high speed golf balls.As well
 as strollers ,the footpath also       
 attracts local boys who like to       
 skirmish in the undergrowth searching 
 for errant golf balls.                
 Alongside the path stands Rose Cottage
 still sporting its old Sun Fire       
 insurance plaque and number.In the    
 cottage garden are several bee hives. </content>
