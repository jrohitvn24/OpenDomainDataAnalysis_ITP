Another popular game with the girls is 
Â£Queenio,Shinio,Polish' A ball is      
thrown and all the children run after  
it.Whoever gets it first holds it      
behind her back.The rest line up       
alongside her and pretend also to      
be hiding the ball.They all shout      
Â£Queenio,Shinio,Polish'.The person who 
threw the ball in the first place      
tries to guess who has the ball.When a 
name is called the person has to show  
her hands.If she has the ball she then 
throws up the ball and the game starts 
over again.If the caller wishes she can
shout Â£Dustbins' and all the children  
Have to turn roun once with their arms 
folded to give the caller a better     
chance.If the caller chooses the wrong 
person then she is out.Although there  
are games such as Hopscotch marked     
on the plaground they are rarely used  </content>
