		<title>01Introduction to Yarlet Area</title>
		<content>  This is a region consisting of gently
 undulating farmland, which is mostly  
 pasture, through half of the western  
 side is arable, growing such crops as 
 potatoes, rape, barley and wheat.     
 There are few woods, but the hedges,  
 which surround each field, have       
 several trees in them. There are two  
 small villages, Whitgreave and Great  
 Bridheford both commutor villages for 
 Stone and Stafford. Yarlet and marston
 are scattered communities of small    
 farms and private homes. Perhaps half 
 the buildings have been put up in this
 century.                              
  Running from north to south is the M6
 motorway and the A34 Trunk road, both 
 of which carry heavy traffic. There   
 are several lans which connect the    
 farms and villages. In the south-west 
 corner the Stone-Safford railway can  
 be seen.                              </content>
