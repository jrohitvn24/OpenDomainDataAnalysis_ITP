		<title>19B.M.X. TRACK</title>
		<content>   Since the Play Area, Page 16, was   
written, the Cycle Track at one end of 
the area has been prepared. As this is 
not intended to be a supervised club   
activity, it has been left in a simple 
but safe condition, with a turn at one 
end, banked up with soil, jumps and a  
deep hollow scooped out on one side.   
   On Friday, 26th. July, the school   
holidays began, and the Dover Boys'    
Brigade arrived in the village for     
their annual camp, bringing the rain   
with them. Their leader rides a B.M.X. 
bike with the Folkestone Fliers, so    
soon took an interest in the track.    
   On Tuesday, 30th. June, the evening 
air was disturbed by the voices of many
youngsters shouting encouragement, as  
the Boys' Brigade took on the local    
boys in a B.M.X. competition. The Track
is proving a success, worthy of the    
effort and expense put into it.        </content>
