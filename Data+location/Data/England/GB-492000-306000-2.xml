		<title>02Dairy Farming</title>
		<content> One of the farms in our area is a     
 Dairy farm belonging to Mr. R. Corby. 
 He employs one full time cowman and   
 four part-time people, his wife doing 
 the accounts.  The farm extends to 138
 acres. There are 84 cows, 74 in milk, 
 most of which are Fresian and a       
 Hereford bull. Some of the 70 calves  
 are Fresian X Hereford. The Fresian   
 heifers are reared for milking, the   
 bull and cross calves are sold on     
 Melton Mowbray market.                
 The cows are milked twice daily in a  
 herring bone parlour.  They are fed on
 silage, carrots, concentrates and     
 cabbage but are usually outside from  
 May to November. Some milk is bottled 
 and sold locally, the rest is sent to 
 Peterborough by tanker. Mr. Corby's   
 fields are fertilized to grow good    
 grass for grazing and sileage.
