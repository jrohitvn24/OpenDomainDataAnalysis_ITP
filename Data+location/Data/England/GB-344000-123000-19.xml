		<content> Escaped trout, perch, eeel and gudgeon
 are the common fish. All fishing is   
 coarse. Rudd, roach and dace are fre- 
 quent.  All song birds are represen-  
 ted and herons, field fare, corvids,  
 magpies, birds of prey and bats.      
 Visitors include whoopers, and occas- 
 ional Bewicks, mallard, redwing, lap- 
 wings, swifts and martins. Pheasant,  
 quail, and skylarks are much in evid- 
 ence, and the barn owls and Little    
 Owls appear to be recovering in num-  
 bers. Cormorants, buzzards, snipe and 
 nightingales are seen. Feral cats and 
 mink, are found on the moors, with    
 escaped roe deer. Aquatic and land    
 rodents feed foxes. Rabbits and hares 
 cause problems, as do moles. Frogs,   
 toads and elvers process across the   
 moors annually. Insect life is        
 becoming more abundant again. Feral   
 ferrets and their cousins now thrive. </content>
