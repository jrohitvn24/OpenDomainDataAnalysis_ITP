		<title>11Mining in the Past.</title>
		<content> Mining in the past was poor.          
 Conditions underground were appalling.
 The miners would have to crouch in the
 most awkward positions. Sometimes the 
 shaft would flood, the miners would   
 still go down with the water up to    
 their waist. The tunnels would be     
 pitch black with only the dim candle  
 light lighting their way. The         
 earliest machinery was the engine     
 house but in the past the best        
 machinery was their hands. The history
 of mining started of with pick axes   
 and shovels. The miners used to go up 
 ladders or up in a cage which is      
 hoisted up by a wheel. The tunnel     
 would be small, even a child would    
 have to crouch underground. Outside of
 the mine the Cornish Stamps would be  
 booming out. The ballmaids would      
 probably go deaf. In the past they    
 mistook fools gold for real Gold!     </content>
