		<title>10PARWICH HILL RACE</title>
		<content> This takes place every year during    
 Parwich Wakes Week. We started by     
 lining up at the start near The       
 Sycamore Inn.                         
 Then off we went past Sycamore        
 Cottages and past West View Cottages. 
 There are arrows all round the course 
 showing you where to go. We went past 
 Anna's house and through a stile into 
 a field which leads to Parwich Hill.  
 It is very steep. At the top of the   
 hill was Tom's dad and he gave us a   
 drink of water. You have to go to the 
 very top or else you will be          
 disqualified. Then we went back down  
 through a gate near Parwich Hall, past
 the shop and back to the pub.         
 Matthew Webster won the race. He was  
 very pleased as he had been trying for
 many years. All kinds of people take  
 part including men, ladies and        
 children.                             </content>
