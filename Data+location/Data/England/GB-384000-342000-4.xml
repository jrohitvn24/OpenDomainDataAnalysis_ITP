		<content>The Villas is a private road of houses.
The houses are very large because the  
rich people who owned factories used to
live there.The Villas are just across  
the road from the school.The road      
through the Villas is not tarmaced.It  
is dusty,stony and bumpy.In the middle 
of the road there is a gas lamp.A man  
tied himself to it because he did not  
want it to be removed.                 
  The houses are Italian style.They    
have stone walls,stone pillars,arches, 
large gates and lovely gardens.        
  Stokeville,as the Villas was called, 
was unique to the area.They were       
residences for the middle classes only.
Lynam,the architect,had the idea for   
the Villas from villa style houses he  
had seen on his travels between Stoke  
and London.
