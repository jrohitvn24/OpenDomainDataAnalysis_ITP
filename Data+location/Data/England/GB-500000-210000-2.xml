		<content>  {   Home Farm,}Gt Gaddesden,is farmed
 by the Halseys.It is highly mechanised
 and cattle  are recorded and fed      
 concentrates by{computer.}All         
 production from an accounting point of
 view is computerized as are the wages 
 of 8  permanent staff, 2 office       
 staff, and 5 temporary staff.         
  The{River Gade}runs through the farm 
 which has its own{Trout Hatchery}for  
 stocking the river with rainbow trout 
 for the local Trout Fishing Syndicate.
 FARMING is extensive and there is     
 five-year crop rotation with oil seed 
 rape which was unused prior to the    
 COMMON MARKET. The CROPS grown cover  
 over 1435 acres &amp; there are 441 grass 
 acres this year.                      
  STUBBLE is burnt to clear the ground 
 of fungus &amp; since it is too expensive 
 to stack it, straw is also burnt.
