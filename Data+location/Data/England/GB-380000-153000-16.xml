		<title>16History- Rode and Southwick.</title>
		<content> The mill at Tellisford, on a Roman    
 site, finished its useful life in the 
 19th century as a flocking mill which 
 shredded rags for mattresses, when it 
 burnt down. The villages were much    
 involved with the weaving trade until 
 1820. In 1860 there was a famous      
 murder at Langham House, involving the
 Kent family; a case still studied by  
 law students. Southwick toll gate, in 
 use at that time, is now planted with 
 trees and has a seat provided by the  
 Womens Institute. Rode is thought to  
 have had witches in medieval times as 
 a stone circle still exists under     
 houses in the village centre. A       
 further indication is that 3 old inns 
 were The White Hart, The Red Lion and 
 The Green Man. The 14th century church
 of St. Lawrence is some way out of the
 village. By the River Frome there are 
 World War II pillboxes.               </content>
