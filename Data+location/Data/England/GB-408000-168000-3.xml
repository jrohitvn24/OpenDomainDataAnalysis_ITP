		<title>03Peter Tate - Local Resident</title>
		<content> Peter Tate has lived in Avebury since 
 1970."Apart from the odd new bungalow 
 replacing old cottages the housing has
 not changed.There has been a gradual  
 build up in the number of visitors    
 coming to the village. Today these are
 more enquiring especially those from  
 foreign lands and young people. I am  
 pleased with the way that Avebury is  
 administered for the tourists, both   
 tactfully and diplomatically. I am    
 concerned that all visitors to Avebury
 and the surrounding district have a   
 really good time.I enjoy living in    
 Avebury because it is a friendly      
 village.Villagers and tourists appear 
 to exist together in harmony. I would 
 make no changes but they will         
 inevitably occur naturally whether for
 better or worse. a place like Avebury 
 does not stand still."
