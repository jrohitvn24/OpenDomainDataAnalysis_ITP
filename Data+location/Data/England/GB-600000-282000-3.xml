      On the Callows' small farm (see  
 page 2) they grow mostly arable crops,
 such as wheat, barley, sugar beet and 
 potatoes.  To make a good income, they
 also breed and rear animals.  They    
 fatten and sell geese at Christmas    
 time.  They breed pigs, which are sold
 at 14 weeks for fattening elsewhere.  
 At the moment, they own 11 breeding   
 pigs and a boar.  They rear cattle.   
 Some are Hereford/Friesian cross and  
 some are Limousin.  The Callows don't 
 breed the calves, but buy them in at 2
 weeks, when they cost about Â£100 each.
                                       
      In order to make full use of     
 their machinery and to add to their   
 income, the Callows rent meadows and  
 sell the hay.  They also buy, cart and
 sell straw.
