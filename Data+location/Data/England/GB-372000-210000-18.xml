		<title>18WICK COURT</title>
		<content> The place of most historical interest 
 is{Wick Court}which was built in the  
 13th century. It was originally a     
 garrison for the army because it was  
 on the top of{Barrow Hill}and a good  
 vantage point. The house has a moat   
 running round it and has its own      
 colony of bats. In the grounds is an  
 oak tree which is reputedly two       
 thousand years old. The house itself  
 is in a good state of repair having   
 been owned by a private family. The   
 last of the family died in the winter 
 and now the house is going to be      
 properly restored and opened to the   
 public.
