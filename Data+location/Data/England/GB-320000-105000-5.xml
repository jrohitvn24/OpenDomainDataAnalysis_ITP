 Some times the cow gets               
 milk fever.Milk fever is when the cow 
 can't get up.You sometimes ring the   
 vet He will come and put some liquid  
 in to the cow by a needle.In about    
 five hours the cow should get         
 up.                                   
       {Sheep and lambs                
                                       
 When you have some sheep and one is   
 ready to lamb you bring in two,to keep
 the one thats ready to lamb company.  
 When it has lambed you can give the   
 sheep some water and  eventually the  
 lamb will be sucking milk from his    
 mothers udder,and that is what makes  
 the lamb grow stronger.Then you can   
 sell it for money or breed from it.
