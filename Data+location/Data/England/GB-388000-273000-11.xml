		<title>11A VISIT TO SWANCOTE FARM</title>
		<content> On June 12th Chaddesley Corbett School
 went to Swancote Farm. First we saw a 
 big shed and Mr. Spencer led us in. We
 saw 5 cows getting ready to be milked.
 Then we saw the milking machine and   
 Mr. Spencer got the suckers and put   
 them on the cows udders and they      
 pulled out the milk that went into the
 big containers. When the milk is all  
 out of the cow it gets sucked up the  
 pipes and goes through the wall into  
 the big milk tanks ready for when the 
 big lorry comes to take the milk away.
 When we got out of the shed we saw a  
 little bull all on his own and his    
 name was Marco Polo because he likes  
 polo mints. Then we went to see two   
 calves and we saw them eating and     
 drinking milk out of a bucket. Then we
 went to see the crops. We saw barley  
 and wheat and some straw. We saw a dog
 named Tegan and he likes chasing birds</content>
