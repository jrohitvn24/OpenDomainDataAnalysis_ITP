		<title>02A Day In My Life In Woolton</title>
		<content>   I usually get up at 7.10 a.m. every 
 morning. I get washed and dressed and 
 go down to watch Breakfast{Television.
 When it has finished I make my lunch. 
 When my mother comes down, the family 
 have breakfast. When it is about 8.45 
 a.m. I set off for{school}in the car  
 with my sister.                       
   When we get to school we go straight
 through into assembly. We have        
 playtime in the morning and afternoon.
 After lunch the boys like to play     
{football.}During the day we have many 
 lessons.                              
   When I come{home}I feed my{rabbit}  
 and then I do my half hour practice on
 the organ. After that I play football 
 and then have dinner. After my dinner 
 I play football again. Then I come in 
 and get in the bath, after which I    
 watch television until 9.00 p.m.
