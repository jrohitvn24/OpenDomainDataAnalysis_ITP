		<content> My father works for British Tekecom in
 the British Telecom Tower in London.  
 He installs new telephone exchanges   
 and sometimes goes on week long       
 courses to learn new techniques.      
 British Telecom service maintain and  
 install telephones and make sure that 
 all telephone lines are working       
 properly. Most homes have at least one
 telephone and they are used for       
 keeping in touch, social chatting and 
 urgent messages such as accidents and 
 business. For non-urgent and business 
 calls it costs at least 6p for 8      
 minutes.                              
 The first main post office in         
 Redbridge was Ilford Post Office near 
 the High Road.  On top of Ilford Post 
 Office is a big communication aerial  
 which sends messages from Ilford to   
 Romford Post Office.
