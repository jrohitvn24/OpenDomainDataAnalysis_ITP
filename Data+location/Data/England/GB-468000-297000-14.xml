		<content> The Parish Carlton Curlieu, which     
 is 1406 acres in area, lies 9 miles   
 south-east of the city of Leicester.  
 It is bounded on the north by the     
 Gartree Road and on the west by one of
 the main tributaries of the River     
 Seuce.  The village stands above a    
 450ft. contour line on sand and       
 gravel.  The soil in the parish is a  
 loamy clay.  No main roads cross the  
 parish.  The population of the parish 
 has never been large and was perhaps  
 larger in the Middle Ages than it has 
 been since.  According to the Domesday
 Survey there were 24 inhabitants.  By 
 1911 this had risen to a high of 93,  
 but today the population is 45.  The  
 village consists of a few farmhouses  
 and cottages grouped near the church  
 with a fine Manor House to the south  
 east.  Most of the houses are red     
 brick built in the early 19th century.</content>
