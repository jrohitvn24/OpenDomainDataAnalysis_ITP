		<title>11The Gregson Institute    (C)</title>
		<content>The Henry Gregson Memorial Hall was    
opened in 1890 as a parochial hall for 
Christ Church. In 1981 repair and      
maintainance costs forced the   parish 
to sell the Hall.The original terms of 
the trust-that it should be used for   
ecclesiastical purposes had long since 
been broken.A group of local residents 
formed the Freehold Community          
Association and after 2 years of       
'legal hassles' completed the purchase 
of the hall in July 1983 for 36000     
pounds,with the help of grants from    
the City and County Councils.The       
renovated building was opened at the   
end of 1983. With help from the Urban  
Aid programme and local businesses the 
centre is manned by 5 MSC workers plus 
an army of volunteers.The centre houses
a licensed club and meeting rooms and  
these are used by members and others   
for a variety of social activities.    </content>
