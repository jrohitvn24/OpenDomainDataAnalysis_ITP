		<title>09LIFE IN A TOWER BLOCK 1</title>
		<content>     People have different opinions    
about life in a tower block.   There   
are some bad points such as incidents  
of vandalism, feelings of loneliness   
and isolation and children who like to 
ride in the lifts or rush up and down  
the stairs.   When the lifts are broken
elderly people can be isolated at      
higher levels.   Sometimes windows are 
broken by stones and bottles.          
Children forget that the flats are     
homes and not a public building.   Some
people missed having a garden and being
able to step out into their own        
backyards.   One lady described living 
in a tower block as like living in a   
box.   When she first moved in she     
suffered from depression owing to      
loneliness and isolation.   She has now
made some friends in neighbouring flats
and is much happier.   The block sways 
in high winds but no-one notices now.  </content>
