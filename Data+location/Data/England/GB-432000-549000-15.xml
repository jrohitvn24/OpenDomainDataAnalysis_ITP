		<content> There are many interesting &amp; historic 
 buildings in Houghton. St.MIchaels    
 church was built in the 13th.Century  
 although restorations which took place
 in the 1830's changed it's appearence.
 There is also the Kepier Grammer      
 School which was founded by Bernard   
 Gilpin,Sometimes referred to as the   
 apostle of the North,in 1574 the      
 Davenport almshouses were built in    
 1668,while the old rectory was built  
 in the 15th.Century is now the council
 Offices.The Elizabethan Houghton Hall 
 is described as one of the more       
 perfect specimens of the "plain style"
 of arcitecture &amp; was so powerfully    
 built that it has required little     
 repair or alteration.In Nesham Place  
 and Church street can be seen some    
 fine examples of 18th.Century town    
 houses.
