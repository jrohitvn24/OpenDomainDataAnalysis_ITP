		<title>18A DAY AWAY FROM BALBY</title>
		<content> On 26th June 1985 my family and I took
 part in a very notable religious and  
 social event with many others from the
 area. The evangelist Billy Graham came
 to Sheffield United' Football Stadium 
 to preach. My whole family went. We   
 dressed in our best clothes. When we  
 reached the stadium we found our      
 seats. There were many people there. A
 choir sang a song then Billy Graham   
 began to preach to us. It was so quiet
 you could hear a pin drop. At about   
 9pm he said, "come doen, confess your 
 sins."Many people did. We received    
 some gifts on the way out. It was late
 when we arrived home. We slept in and 
 did not go to school the next day. It 
 was worth it for all the family it was
 magic.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
