		<content> The{school}stands on about six acres  
 of land. My school is good. We have  4
 female{teachers.}Mr. Saddington is the
 headmaster. Mrs. Ruddock is his       
 secretary. She does first aid too. The
 school supplies us with pencils, books
 pens, buses to get to school. My      
 favourite lessons are art, maths,     
 swimming &amp; English. My worst lesson is
 FRENCH. This year the 4th.years will  
 be leaving &amp; if nothing goes wrong I  
 will be the oldest in the school, not 
 including teachers. We have 154       
 pupils. It is not a very large school.
 Carlton Holy Family is the school we  
 go into next. The oldest pupil is 11  
 and the youngest 4. We have 2 play    
 times the infants have 3. School      
 starts at 9.10am and finishes at      
 3.20pm. School dinners are reasonable.
 I have packed lunch. 98 others do as  
 well, 41 have dinners.{Nicola Howley  </content>
