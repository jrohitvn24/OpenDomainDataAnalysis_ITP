		<content> The fairly dry climate means arable   
 farming is important &amp; with the huge  
 machinery now in use,this has led to  
 loss of hedges,ditches &amp; ponds,but    
 those remaining are often managed with
 conservation in mind,eg.the A-line    
 hedges on Hedenham Hall Estate.Cereal 
 farming brings with it straw-burning  
 after harvest,but more care recently  
 has led to less damage to wildlife    
 though smoke pollutes the air &amp;       
 charred particles drift into houses.  
 Shooting over the estates &amp; farms has 
 had one valuable effect;it ensures the
 survival or planting of woods.One is  
 Sexton Wood,90a. of ancient woodland, 
 particularly interesting because it   
 has some of the most northerly Horn-  
 beam in the U.K.;as a Designated SSSI 
 its survival should be secure.        
 Walking &amp; riding are pleasurable with 
 9 registered footpaths &amp; 6 bridleways.</content>
