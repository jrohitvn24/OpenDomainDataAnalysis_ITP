		<title>08SCHOOLS IN BRADWELL</title>
		<content>   As the village grew in size it      
 became necessary to build a new       
 school.It was opened in 1967 and was  
 called Bradwell Junior School.        
 Homefield became the infant school.   
                                       
  {"We had a magazine called the Hungry
{Hill News. It was called this because 
{the school had been built on a field  
{known as the hungry hill."}           
                                       
   In 1976 Woodlands Middle School was 
 opened. The two other schools became  
 first schools, Bradwell Junior        
 becoming Hillside First.              
{                                      
{  "I remember the day we changed      
{schools. Every child carried something
{and we walked from Hillside to        
{Woodlands in one enormous crocodile."
