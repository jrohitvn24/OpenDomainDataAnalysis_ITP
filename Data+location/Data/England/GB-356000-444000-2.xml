		<content> Most of the farm land is used for     
 grazing and meadow land.              
                                       
 The extreme East of the area is very  
 steep and used for rough grazing.The  
 hills in the East are Parlick Fell,   
 Blindhurst Fell and Fairsnape Fell.   
 They are covered mainly with bracken, 
 rushes and heather.                   
                                       
 Quite a lot of conifers have been     
 planted and there is deciduous        
 woodland around the River Brock and   
 around peoples homes.Also there are   
 many rhododendron bushes in the woods.
                                       
 The River Brock has two sources one   
 rising on Fairsnape Fell and the other
 on Blindhurst Fell.The Winsnape Brook 
 and Clough Head Brook are tributaries 
 of the River Brock.
