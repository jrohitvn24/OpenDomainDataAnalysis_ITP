		<title>19The Ridgeway Path.</title>
		<content> This long distance path runs from     
 Overton Hill to Ivinghoe Beacon in    
 Buckinghamshire.                      
 From the A4 transport cafe the chalky 
 path, as wide as a road, climbs       
 northwards for a mile, from 170 to    
 over 200 metres above sea level. It   
 passes cultivated land, fenced on the 
 right side, but mostly open on the    
 left.                                 
 On reaching{Fyfield Down,}it crosses  
 grassland with sheep and cows grazing.
 It is truly a path not only for man,  
 but for animals,too.                  
 This national{nature reserve}is a well
 preserved, bare landscape, possibly   
 4000 years old.                       
 The way is signposted by stone markers
 on the ground. One passes cattle      
 troughs and numerous boulders.        
 The path heads on towards Hackpen     
 Hill and Barbary Castle.              </content>
