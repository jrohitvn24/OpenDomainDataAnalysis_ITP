 had 3 storeys and a rear service wing 
 of 2 storeys.An extension was added   
 later .The valley overlooked by the   
 house became an ornamental park before
 1825 .The estate is not used by the   
 owners but has been rented out over a 
 long period as a weekend retreat for  
 another family.In the past this house 
 has been used as a Convalescent Home  
 for POW's during the 1939-45

 time.Now the house conssists of 9     
 bedrooms,6 bathrooms, dining room,    
 sitting room,drawing room, breakfast  
 room,flower room,playroom and kitchen.
