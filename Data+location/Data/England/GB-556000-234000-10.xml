		<title>10Commuting from Wimbish</title>
		<content> In 1985 a commuter is a person who    
 travels by train or car from home,    
 which is usually outside a city, to   
 work, which is usually in a city. I   
 travel in the car 8 miles to Audley   
 End railway station in time to catch  
 the 8.08am. train to London. The      
 journey is a fast one, taking just    
 under an hour. On the train I         
 sometimes work, or read the newspaper.
 Some days the train is so crowded that
 I have to stand all the way to the    
 terminus at Liverpool Street. I arrive
 at work at about 9.30am. I work all   
 day, with a short break morning and   
 afternoon, and an hour for lunch.     
 Being a married woman with a family I 
 often go shopping at lunchtime. At    
 5.30pm I lock up and catch the train  
 home. Often I am so tired that I sleep
 for part of the journey. I try to     
 relax in the evenings before bedtime. </content>
