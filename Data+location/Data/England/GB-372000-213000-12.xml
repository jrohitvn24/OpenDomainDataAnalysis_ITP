		<title>12Fishing on the River Severn</title>
		<content> Salmon fishing is important but needs 
 no explanation;elvering is less widely
 known about in the country at large   
 though here,along these reaches of the
 Severn,it is a common sight in March  
 to see elvering nets on the roof-racks
 of cars.Elvers,which are baby eels and
 are greyish finger-length creatures   
 rather thinner than a drinking        
 straw,are caught in specially shaped  
 fine-mesh nets in the spring when the 
 tide is right.Much fishing is done at 
 night and you can see the dotted      
 lights of fishing parties along the   
 banks as they scoop out the wriggling 
 prey.Elvers are eaten whole,fried in a
 mass like whitebait,but nowadays much 
 is sent by air to places such as Japan
 for about Â£1 per lb.One consignment   
 this March(1985)went to start a new   
 life in Irish lakes as it was sent to 
 stock those waters.                   </content>
