		<content> This is block comprises two villages- 
{Babraham,}whose name is derived from  
 Beaduburgh, a Saxon chieftainess, and 
 literally was 'Barbara's Ham', and    
 Sawston. Babraham is a small village  
 within 2387 acres of farmland lying 6 
 miles SE of Cambridge on the river    
 Granta, bounded by an ancient Roman   
 road to the north and Icknield Way to 
 the east. There is one village        
 street,'High Street', with development
 mainly on the SE side. Written records
 of{Sawston}go back to AD970; it lies  
 close to the river Granta and is      
 sheltered from the NE by the Gog Magog
 hills. The population has quadrupled  
 in the last 25 years and now stands at
 7200. Within the village nucleus may  
 be found medieval houses and inns and 
 two manorial dovecotes. Much of       
 Sawston is protected by Cambridge     
 Green Belt.                           </content>
