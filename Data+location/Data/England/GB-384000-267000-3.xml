		<title>03ENDURING RURAL LIFE &amp; LAND</title>
		<content> This predominantly agriculture area   
 has remained relatively uchanged since
 the last Domesday survey: an area of  
 gentle prosperity rather than wealth. 
                                       
 Some of the rural quiet was removed in
 World War II when an extensive complex
 of aircraft repair workshops was      
 built. The buildings remain but they  
 now form an industrial estate with    
 many different trades represented.    
                                       
 The sole "public building" is the     
 Anglican Parish Church, largely       
 rebuilt in the 19th century only the  
 lower part of the tower remains of the
 previous building.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
