		<title>04Mr Dickens-Fishing Bailiff</title>
		<content>               Mr Dickens is the       
 fishing bailiff for the lakes just to 
 the south of Mollands Lane.A bailiff  
 is someone who walks around the lakes,
 checking the permits and licences of  
 people who are fishing there.He also  
 ensures that stocks of fish are up to 
 required standards.Mr Dickens works   
 for South Essex Carp Fisheries.There  
 are six lakes in the area altogether. 
                In the lakes there     
 are fish weighing up to 30lbs such as 
 carp,pike and trout.When we visited   
 the lakes,we saw three pairs of Great 
 Crested Grebes.One Grebe was diving   
 under water, searching for fish.It    
 stayed under for about twenty         
 seconds,then it resurfaced in a       
 different part of the lake.
