		<title>10Transport in Ladock</title>
		<content>  There is very little public transport
 in Ladock. Lots of people have cars   
 because they live a long way from the 
 bus stops and shops and there is not a
 good public transport service. The    
 road has been widened so they could   
 have a pavement and it would be safer 
 for pedestrians and drivers.          
  At Ladock there are 2 different kinds
 of coaches,Harris Coaches and Cornwall
 Busways.Cornwall Busways link Ladock  
 with the East and West of the county, 
 they go through at the same time each 
 day 10.00am and 2.15pm. Harris coaches
 go through Ladock to Truro from Summer
 Court 4 times on Weds and Sats and    
 twice on other days. Children pay 25p 
 and adults pay 45p for a single fare. 
  A railway runs about a mile South    
 of Ladock but there is no station at  
 Ladock. The nearest stations are 8    
 miles away at St.Austell and Truro.   </content>
