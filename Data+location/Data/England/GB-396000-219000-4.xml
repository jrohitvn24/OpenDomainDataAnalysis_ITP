		<content>  Charlton Kings has both upland and   
 lowland farms. Those on the hills,    
 which are generally larger in size,   
 have poorer soil with many limestone  
 rocks. The valley farms have richer   
 soils. Ham Hill Farm, an upland farm  
 of 170 acres, has mainly pasture for  
 beef cattle and sheep although 20     
 acres are laid down for winter feed.  
 Favoured breeds are Hereford cattle   
 and Scotch sheep half-bred with       
 Suffolk rams. The farmer takes        
 livestock to market in Gloucester.    
 Coxhorne Farm, a valley farm, is 70   
 acres and primarily a dairy farm      
 having Fresian, Guernsey/Hereford     
 cross cattle. Milk is collected daily 
 in a tanker and the farm is checked   
 twice a year to guarantee milk        
 quality. The milk from this farm is   
 not turned into cheese or butter. They
 do not grow cereals.                  </content>
