		<content> This block is on the western edge of  
 Hull.It is equally divided between    
 housing and farming.The southern half 
 of the block is mainly residential    
 centred on two villages (Willerby and 
 Kirkella, total pop. 5000).Willerby in
 particular seems to be a suburb of    
 Hull.The housing is a mixture of      
 traditional terraced and semi-detached
 with several recent developments of   
 small private estates.                
   Kirkella retains more of the        
 character of a rural village with its 
 centre around the medieval church of  
 St. Andrew's.The houses are generally 
 bigger and more expensive than in     
 Willerby, a large percentage being    
 semis or detached.                    
  The only industry is a small, light  
 industrial estate on Great Gutter     
 Lane, Willerby.
