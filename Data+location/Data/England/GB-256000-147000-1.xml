		<content>      The village of Combe Martin lies 
 five miles to the east of Ilfracombe  
 and ten miles from Barnstaple.        
      The area includes many beaches   
 some of which are only reached by     
 steep paths.  The two main beaches,   
 Harbour beach and Newberry beach,     
 become one at low tide which exposes a
 large expanse of sand with safe       
 sea bathing.  The rock pools and      
 streams afford children many hours of 
 enjoyment.                            
      The main attractions are the     
 peace and quiet and the scenic beauty.
      For the visitors there are many  
 types of accomodation, restaurants,   
 cafes and shops of all kinds.  There  
 is car parking for about 200 cars.    
      The village primary school is in 
 this area together with many          
 attractive bungalows as this is also a
 favourite retirement area.            </content>
