		<title>12Work on White Cross Farm</title>
		<content>                                       
The farm is typical of the area in that
the  farmer's wife also helps out.  The
work  varies  according to  season  but
generally  the  farmer's wife  is  kept
busy  cleaning, cooking and  gardening.
The  farmer and his two labourers  feed
the stock every day and they also  have
to muck out the cowsheds.              
Regular visits are paid to market.  The
usual places visited are Penkridge on a
Monday and Uttoxeter on a Thursday with
the occasional visit to Shrewsbury.
