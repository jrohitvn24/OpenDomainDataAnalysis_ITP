 8.00.Get up and have breakfast.       
 8.40.Leave home for Buxton College.   
 This is an all boys' school.          
 9.00.Registration Bell. You have      
 lessons until 11.45. Then it's dinner 
 until 12.50. Then back to work until  
 break at 2.05. This lasts until 2.25. 
 The end of the school day is at 3.30. 
 Arrive home around 4.00. Get changed  
 and go down to the Swimming Baths.    
 I usually have dinner at 6.00 to 7.00 
 depending on what time my father gets 
 in from work. After dinner I either   
 watch T.V., or go out with my friends.
 I would get in from playing at 10.00. 
 I then have a shower, do my homework, 
 if I have any, and get my things ready
 for school. Around 10.45 I go to bed  
 and read.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
