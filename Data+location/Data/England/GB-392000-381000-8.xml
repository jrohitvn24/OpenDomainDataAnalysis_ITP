 Lyme Park is owned by the National    
 Trust and is open at all times and in 
 all areas.There are two different     
 types of countryside. Around West     
 Parkgate is mainly woodland containing
 a variety of wildlife such as rabbits 
 squirrels and birds.A small stream    
 runs alongside a steep path leading to
 the open grassland.Here it is hilly   
 with lots of open spaces and a strong 
 wind blowing.                         
 The walkway is a disused railway line 
 converted by the Borough Council into 
 a 15km walkway from Macclesfield to   
 Marple.Evidence of the old railway    
 line can still be seen such a the     
 platform and bridges.Aswell as a      
 separate track for horseriding there  
 are parking and picnic areas.         </content>
