		<content> To land at the airport you have to pay
 a fee of Â£5 and to keep your plane in 
 a hanger you have to pay Â£60-Â£70 a    
 month, but if you have a plane with   
 wings that fold up it costs less      
 because it takes up less space.  Two  
 hangers at the airport are for keeping
 planes in (they are owned by Evergreen
 Holdings) the other two are for       
 building planes.  These are privately 
 owned.  They have about 35 planes at  
 the airport and 35 have been built    
 there.  Some of these planes are used 
 for pleasure flights taking tourists  
 around the island on different        
 routes. Occasionally V.I.P.'s land at 
 the airport.  This year on May 30th   
{PRINCESS DIANA}came to the island by  
 helicopter arriving in a field in Ryde
 and leaving from Sandown Airport.  My 
 dad is a local General Practitioner.
