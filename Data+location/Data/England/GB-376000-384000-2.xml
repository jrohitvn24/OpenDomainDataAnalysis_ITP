		<title>02AREA HISTORY TO MID 19th.C.</title>
		<content>   Much of the land, subsequently      
 divided, was first owned by the Massey
 Family but was re_united by 1850 to   
 the{Earls of Stamford}of Dunham Hall. 
 Many buildings in the area have a     
 17th. Century farming heritage, e.g.  
{Ollerbarrow Farm,}now a shop. Farms   
 have always been important to the     
 local economy. Early houses,{Victorian
{Gothic Villas,}were first built for   
 Manchester's retired professional     
 people, doctors, businessmen etc. The 
 old age pensioners of the "cottage"   
 tea club alongside Hale's bowling     
 green provided the Survey team with   
 much help and had pleasant memories of
 the area before it became dominated by
 the shops and the motor car. Their    
 favourite memory was of walking       
 everywhere: to school, church and even
 to work on the nearby farms.
