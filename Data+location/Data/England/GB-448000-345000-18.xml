 At 7.30 a.m. I woke up and went       
 downstairs for my breakfast of cereals
 and toast.After having a wash and     
 cleaning my teeth I got dressed and   
 set off for school.At school when we'd
 been through the register I did paired
 reading with one of the first year    
 girls who has difficulty with her     
 reading.Later we had spelling and     
 tables tests until playtime when we   
 played a game called elastic.In this  
 game we jump over elastic at different
 heights.After play I wrote a poem and 
 drew a picture of a fox. I also did   
 some maths.After dinner Simon finished
 off his talk-about and we went into   
 the hall to listen  to a man talking  
 about his travels.When we came in     
 after play we had a quiz. When school 
 had finished I dashed home and watched
 television until 10.30p.m.Then bed.   </content>
