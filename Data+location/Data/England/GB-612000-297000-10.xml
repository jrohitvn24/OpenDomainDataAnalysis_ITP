		<content>{Amateur Drama, why do it? It's fun!   
 Anyone,any age,can join in. We get to-
 gether a group, choose a producer and 
 a play, cast it, choose a prompt and  
 rehearse. First in our homes, then in 
 our Village Hall, weekly at first then
 more often;then the week prior to per-
 formance - nightly (and in our sleep).
                                       
 We have our words on tape, nerves on  
 edge &amp; work cut out as we also build, 
 decorate &amp; light the set. Do sound    
 effects, props, costumes, make-up &amp;   
 publicity. Sell tickets &amp; remember to 
 book the Hall in advance. We man the  
 door, set up the chairs, do the raffle
 &amp; sweep the floor. A dress rehearsal  
 if it is bad, can only get better!    
 Finally, at last we're on!{Applause!  
{Laughter! Congratulations!  Photos!   
{Party!  Do it again?  Of course.
