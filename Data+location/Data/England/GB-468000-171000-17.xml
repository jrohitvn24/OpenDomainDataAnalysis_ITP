 dwellings;a mixture of houses,flats,  
 maisonettes and old peoples homes.At

 piece and opened by the Dutchess of   
 Kent.The centre of the estate is lyon 
 square an open space planted with     
 ornamental trees and shrubs.To one    
 side there is a small shopping        
 precinct.Close to lyon square are     
 Raniket junior and infant School      
 catering for children aged 3\-11yrs.  
 The junior school was opened in       
 November 1970 and the infant school in
 September 1973.The name Raniket was   
 given to the school since the Dee Road

 a war time (1939-45)army camp of that 
 name.In 1983 it was decided to        
 demolish the flats.                   </content>
