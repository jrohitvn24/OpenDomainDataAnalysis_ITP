Tig the Scarecrow is a game like       
tig.What youi have to do is to always  
keep away from the person who is on and
you do get tug you have to stand with  
your legs and arms apart and the people
who haven't got tug come up and touch  
you on  both arms and both legs without
getting caught and then you are free.  
  Chinese whispers is a good game.All  
you have to do is to sit in a circle on
the floor and the person at the        
beginning sends a whisper off and you  
have to pass it on to the last person. 
They say what they have heard and      
sometimes it is very funny and nothing 
like what it started out like.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
