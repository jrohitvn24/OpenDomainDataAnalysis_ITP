		<title>12A bank in Brackley</title>
		<content>   We visted a bank in Brackley and    
talked to the manager. He starts work  
at 9.00a.m. and stays until all the    
work is done. Sometimes he helps count 
the  money at the end of the day. He is
responsible for the running of the     
branch and his staff (there are 17     
but they do not all work at the same   
time). He wanted to work in a bank as  
he liked doing maths but he finds that 
the computer does most of the work.    
   The bank offers many services such  
as mortgages, traveller's cheques,     
cheque and savings accounts and        
overdrafts. They also keep valuables   
in their safe for customers. It is a   
room with a heavy door and shelves.    
Inside this is {another} room with     
another heavy door and in there is a   
box safe with the bank's money.People  
always go into the safe in twos so     
that everyone has a witness.           </content>
