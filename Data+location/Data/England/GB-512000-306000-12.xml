		<content> Much of our area is arable farmland.  
 Farm sizes are about 350 acres and the
 field sizes about 10 acres.The fields 
 are now bigger than they used to be.  
 They are bigger because all the       
 hedgerows have been taken away to make
 more room for the larger machines.    
 About 30 years ago the fields were    
 worked by horses, but nowadays        
 machinery is used because it is       
 quicker and less men are needed. This 
 made an effect on all the wildlife, so
 now all the farmers are planting small
 trees and bushes back in places where 
 crops wouldn't grow, to encourage more
 animals to breed. Some of these are   
 then shot for sport. The farmer's     
 biggest enemies are pigeons, the      
 weather, fungi, beetles and the bank  
 manager. The major crops grown are    
 barley, winter-wheat, sugar-beet,     
 triticale, oil-seed rape and potatoes.</content>
