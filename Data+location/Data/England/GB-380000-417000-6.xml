 By examining this area it was found to
 be sparsely populated due to the fact 
 that it was rural with rugged terrain,
 hills and farmland. The people tended 
 to dwell in chusters, the main two    
 being the villages of{Turn}and        
{Shuttleworth.}More remote parts were  
 populated by isolated farms and other 
 dwellings.                            
 The population consisted mainly of the
 elderly who had either lived there all
 their lives, or moved there on        
 retirement.                           
 The population seemed to be gradually 
 expanding with some new houses being  
 built and the average age of the      
 population was declining with more    
 young families moving in.             
 The people interviewed in the area    
 were found to be very friendly and    
 co-operative.                         </content>
