		<content> When I leave home ;in the morning at  
 8.3O I catch a{taxito school}and it   
 takes ten minutes.  The children at my
 school are aged{4 - ll}years.  There  
 are over 5O children in a{lOO year old
{building.} When I get to school we    
 have assembly and when that finishes  
 we do English.  Then we do Maths and  
 in our maths we do fractions.  On     
 Tuesday in the afternoon we play      
 football in the field.  Every Monday  
 morning we have music.  On Wednesday  
 we have a different teacher, Mr.Jones 
 the head mistress's husband.  Usually 
 we have three lady teachers all middle
 aged.  We have wood work nd I am      
 making a boat and I painted it blue   
  and it has a long sail.  When school 
 finishes at 3.3O p.m. I get a taxi    
 home.
