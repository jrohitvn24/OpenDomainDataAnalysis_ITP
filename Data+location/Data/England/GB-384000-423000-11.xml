		<title>11Chamber Farm - Water</title>
		<content> One of the highest dairy farms in the 
 country is to be found in Water. This 
 is Chamber Farm owned and run by Mr.  
 W. Feber. There are 102 acres devoted 
 to hay meadows or rough grazing for   
 the 80 cows and 24 sheep. There are   
 also 1000 battery hens,these and the  
 cows provide the greatest income for  
 the farm. It is run entirely on modern
 principles with much machinery and    
 needs only 2 people to keep it going. 
     The buildings are a mixture of    
 traditional stone and some modern     
 additions. The farmhouse and long barn
 are 955ft above sea level and face    
 SSW,the house is reputed to have been 
 an overnight stop for John Wesley when
 preaching locally. The attached barn  
 has a hay loft holding 40 tons and 2  
 shippens beneath,each milking and     
 feeding 24 cows. There is a 200 gallon
 holding tank for the milk.            </content>
