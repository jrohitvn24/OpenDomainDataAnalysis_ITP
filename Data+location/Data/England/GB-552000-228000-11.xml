		<content>  Pargetting is patterns in plaster on 
 the outside of houses .It protected   
 old wooden houses.There are several   
 reasons why you could have had        
 it,because it looks nice,it shows you 
 are rich and shows you have good      
 taste.Different designs for the       
 plaster are simple patterns,or        
 pictures.Simple patterns are most     
 common.Pargetting first began in the  
 1500s and 1600s but died out and      
 became popular again in the 1900.To   
 pargette you spread the plaster on a  
 wall,and make the pattern on it with a
 stick or with special tools ,they     
 sometimes use moulds .Pargetting is   
 very common in NW Essex.400 years ago 
 pargette was made of lime plaster     
 which was very weak and runny so it   
 was thickened with hair ,straw ,wood  
 shavings .cheese &amp; manure.Nowadays    
 cement plaster is usually used.       </content>
