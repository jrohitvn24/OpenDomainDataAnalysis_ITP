		<title>11Our Town Band</title>
		<content> Exmouth has its own town band and also
 a training band where youngsters go on
 Monday nights to learn to play in the 
 band. We have clarinets, flutes and a 
 brass section. The town band often    
 plays at summer fetes and local       
 functions and sometimes the training  
 band plays before the town band.      
 Recently the Marine Camp donated a    
 GOLD cornet worth about 200 pounds to 
 the band. Band lasts for an hour and  
 we play a selection of marches and    
 waltzes as well as other tunes. There 
 are 6 people from Marpool School that 
 go to the training band and we think  
 SOMETIMES we enjoy it.
