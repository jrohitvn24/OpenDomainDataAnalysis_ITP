		<content> The only day he gets off is Sunday but
 sometimes he has to work in the       
 morning. Sometimes Roy comes in about 
 8.00pm and leaves at 8.30am. Roy has  
 to put the bread in the oven and make 
 sure it is well cooked. About 6.00am  
 each day Phil comes in and drives the 
 van. Phil takes all the bread and     
 cakes to the shops and people who have
 ordered them. Our bakery is 200 years 
 old and has been in our family 62     
 years. That has been for 3 generations
 of our family. We own the one bakery  
 in Titchfield.We have not got a garden
 but have got a yard. Over 400 loaves  
 are made each day. I like living in a 
 bakery.
