{The River Kent} flows into {Morecambe 
{Bay}at Arnside along with the rivers{ 
{Bela}and{Winster.}The River Kent is   
 the largest of these rivers and rises 
 in the{Kentmere Valley}some 20 miles  
 away north of{Kendal.}Until the       
 building of the railway viaduct in the
 1850's the river was navigable as far 
 as{Milnthorpe}- the only port in the  
 former County of{Westmorland.}Flax    
 from Ireland was imported for the     
 manufacture of twine. Iron ore and    
 lime was exported from Arnside Knott  
 for the Liverpool iron industry.      
                                       
 The rivers in the estuary are famous  
 for salmon and trout fishing and for a
 small plaice-life fish know as a      
 flook, flounder or flattie.
