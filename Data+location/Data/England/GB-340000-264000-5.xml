		<title>05SHEEP AT COVENHOPE AYMESTREY</title>
		<content>  At present on the farm there are     
 about 30 head of pedigree ewes, these 
 include{British Charollais}sheep and  
{British Texels. }The sheep are kept   
 mainly to clean up the pastures after 
 the dairy herd.  As they are pedigrees
 the best rams are kept for breeding   
 and the plainer sort are culled early 
 into the Spring lamb market. The ewe  
 lambs are kept to replenish the flock.
 These are born early January onwards  
 so the ewes have to be housed in mid  
 December and they are fed from here   
 onwards, until they give birth, on    
 hay, wet sugar beet pulp(important to 
 prevent twin-lamb diseases), oats and 
 flake maize. After lambing they are   
 given more concentrates and turned out
 to grass. All the sheep have to be    
 dipped against sheep scab and maggot  
 fly in July and October and are also  
 treated for worms, fluke and footrot. </content>
