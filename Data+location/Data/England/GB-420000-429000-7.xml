		<title>07FULNECK MORAVIAN GRAVEYARD</title>
		<content>  The gravestones in Fulneck are flat  
 to show equality in death, men's and  
 women's stones in different sections. 
  Most stones are made of Yorkshire    
 sandstone but newer ones are made of  
 granite. Most of the stones have the  
 person's name, date of birth and      
 death, and a number. The first person 
 to be buried was Grace Clark in 1749. 
 Most of the stones are covered with   
 moss.                                 
  Miss E.C.Lawford wrote a plan of the 
 graveyard, which Moravians call God's 
 Acre, in 1877. Brother John Ingham,   
 the present chief steward, has made a 
 more recent record.                   
  Honesty, bluebells, chickweed,       
 timothy, forget-me-nots, dandelions   
 and cow parsley grow there. Slugs,    
 beetles, bees, wasps and spiders are  
 found there, the webs glittering with 
 dew.                                  </content>
