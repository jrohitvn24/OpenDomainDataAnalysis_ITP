		<content>  There is a hall in the village with a
 big farm attached. Mrs Hughes came to 
 live there when she married and has   
 lived there ever since. She has six   
 children and many grand children. They
 frequently all come to stay for family
 occasions and she loves having them.  
  The hall is an old seventeenth       
 century building with beautiful       
 gardens surrounding it which are      
 sometimes open to the public. There is
 a big lake with wild fowl which is    
 gaurded by wire all round to protect  
 them from foxes. There is also a watwr
 garden which is planted on the site of
 the old swimming pool.                
  There is a house on the site called  
 the Nursey House which is where the   
 children lived when they were small   
 with their nanny. There is a large    
 enclosure with a herd of red deer
