		<title>01THE CRADLEY AREA</title>
		<content> This is an area of outstanding        
 beauty. It contains the village of    
 Cradley which was originally called   
{CREDELAIE}and referred to in the      
 Domesday book as such.Beautiful       
 woodlands surround the village and    
 there are very pleasant walks and     
 bridle ways.It is a rural area and    
 there is no industry to be found      
 here.The farming in this area is      
 mostly mixed with beef and dairy      
 cattle,sheep and cereal crops.The area
 lies to the west of the Malvern Hills 
 and is easily reached along the       
 A 4103 Worcester to Hereford road.The 
 church and the village hall are the   
 principal monuments.The whole area is 
 served by a village school which has  
 about one hundred pupils.
