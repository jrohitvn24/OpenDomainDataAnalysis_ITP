		<content> room, with toilet, washbasin and bath,
 and three bedrooms. We have had the   
 garage changed into a sitting room and
 the old sitting room is a bedroom. Our
 house isn't in a very big estate. I   
 don't think, some of our frames are   
 wood well, only the ones in           
 conservatory and sitting room are     
 aluminuim. We have got 8 windows      
 donstairs and 4 upstairs. In between  
 our garden and the garden next door we
 have got some shrubs. I have got quite
 a big front garden and the back is a  
 bit larger. I have got a drive that   
 slopes down but it is is not very     
 steep.
