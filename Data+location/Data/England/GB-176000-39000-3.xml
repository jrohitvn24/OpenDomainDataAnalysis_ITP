 ground).There are 4 classes,and one is
 in the Church Hall next door.There are
 4 teachers: Mrs Lynn_Smith(Head), Mrs

 Mullett and Mrs Malone_Bartrip.  There
 are about 100 children aged from 4-11.
 There are three small playgrounds.  In
 one of them  there is  a raised garden
 bed with shrubs,   flowers  and veget-
 ables.   The toilets are outside. P.E.
 is done in the Village Hall and  Games
 on the field next door. We have a sec-
 retary,  caretaker,  two canteen staff
 and two dinner ladies.   The secretary
 helps with the 'rising 5's'.  We go to
 Truro Baths  once a week for swimming.
