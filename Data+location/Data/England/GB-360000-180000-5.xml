		<title>05CONSERVATION ON THE COMMON</title>
		<content> People have been very concernd because
 new houses might be built.If the new  
 houses are built the common will be   
 destroyed.The Council for the         
 Protection of Rural England is        
 particularly worried that the         
 common land and natural habitats,will 
 be lost.However the mini-town planers 
 have said they want to preserve       
 Savages Wood,Sherbourne's Brake,Webbs 
 Wood and Stoke Brook which are major  
 uncultivated areas.A conservation     
 group in our area called Avon Wildlife
 Trust is working to protect the       
 land.Young people can join the Watch  
 club,the junior section of the        
 Trust,but it does not yet have a large
 group in the area.
