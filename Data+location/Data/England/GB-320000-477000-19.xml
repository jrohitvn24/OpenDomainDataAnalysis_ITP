		<title>19PUBLIC TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Problems and Answers:                 
    Railway and bus services have      
 tended to be curtailed because of high
 costs of fuel, materials, maintenance 
 and personal skills required to run   
 top grade efficient services. As a    
 consequence commuters to other centres
 of employment have tended to use their
 own personal transport such as the    
 motor car which of course, though     
 costly, is very convenient.           
    To return to full public transport 
 facilities would require an improved  
 use of existing services and/or a     
 reduction in costs of conveyance      
 neither of which seem likely and an   
 additional hope for subsidisation     
 cannot be envisaged. However there    
 still exists a suitable public        
 transport system, rail and road, which
 satisfies present demands.
