		<content>  Fifty years ago all                  
 goods arrived and                     
 left the village on the trains from   
 Brafferton station. Before that       
 everything came by boat up the river. 
 But now everything comes and goes by  
 road.There are all types of vehicles  
 ,cars,buses,bikes,motorbikes,vans,truc
 ks carrying sheep and cows and farm   
 machinery, tractors,trailers and      
 combine harvesters. Only the school   
 bus goes to Easingwold and Borough    
 -bridge. You can go to Ripon on       
 Saturday afternoons by coach. Each    
 weekday Eddie Brown,who has a private 
 bus company in the village, runs two  
 buses to York. He also has coaches for
 outings and tours. Most of the young  
 people have motorbikes so they can go 
 to discoes or to work. The children   
 ride bikes and BMXes. Some girls have 
 ponies.              Richard Myers.   </content>
