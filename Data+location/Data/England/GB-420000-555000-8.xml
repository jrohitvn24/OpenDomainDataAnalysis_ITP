		<title>08THE TANFIELD RAILWAY SOCIETY</title>
		<content>{The Tanfield Railway Association}was  
 founded in 1975.Its aim is to preserve
 part of the Tanfield Railway which is 
 the oldest operating railway in the   
 world.                                
       In 1985 the track is 1 mile long
 and runs from Marley Hill Engine Shed 
 to Sunniside. It is open to the public
 every Sunday in June,July and August, 
 and Bank holidays,when a steam engine 
 pulls three carriages along the track.
    The members of the Tanfield Railway
 Association restore engines. Their    
 oldest engine is a Wellington built by
 Black-Hawthorn,Gateshead in 1873.At   
 the moment there are 27 engines, all  
 of which have been given to them,and 3
 carriages.Eventually it is hoped to   
 extend the line a further 2 miles to  
 Tanfield.More track has to be laid,4  
 stations and a road bridge built and  
 more rolling stock acquired.          </content>
