 St. John the Baptist, situated in the 
 High Street, a fine example of        
 perpendicular architecture.The present

 in the 15th century. The recently     
 restored tower dates from 1475.

 High Street, was built sometime after 
 1400, as courts for the Sheriffs and  
 Justices of the Peace. In earlier
