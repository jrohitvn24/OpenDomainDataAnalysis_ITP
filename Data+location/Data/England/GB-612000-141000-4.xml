		<content> Here is a list of the shops: 2        
 butchers, V G Stores, chemist, Lyminge
 Fashions, greengrocers, Post Office, 2
 house agents, Mace Stores, stationers,
 newsagents, baker, hairdresser,       
 hardware, off-licence, fish &amp; chips,  
 cafe. Station Road has the most shops,
 it has nine. Canterbury Road has four,
 Mayfield has three and the High Street
 has two. We did a survey of which     
 shops people in our class used the    
 most. VG was the most popular, closely
 followed by the newsagents. Next came 
 the Post Office, all the rest people  
 did not go to much. We decided to     
 compare the prices of canned drinks.  
 VG and Mace were the cheapest at 20p. 
 The fish and chip shop came next,     
 closely followed by the off-licence   
 and newsagents at 25p. The most       
 expensive was the cafe at 28p.
