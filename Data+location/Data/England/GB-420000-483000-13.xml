		<title>13FARMING</title>
		<content> Most farms in the area are mixed and  
 dairy farms. The dairy farmers grow   
 grass and other crops like hay,silage,
 corn, stubble-turnips and kale. The   
 cows like these crops but they have to
 be prepared in a special way like     
 corn.The corn is stored in a tower or 
 bin until needed. When it is needed it
 is rolled in a mill. After that it is 
 mixed with proteins. The cows eat this
 mixture twice-a-day at milking times. 
                                       
 The farmers in this area who grow corn
 have to look after it because there   
 are many leaf and root diseases.The   
 main diseases are Ryncosporium and    
 Mildew. The farmer has to keep these  
 diseases off the flag leaf because it 
 will damage the head of corn. A       
 general fungiside is used for this    
 purpose.                              
                                       </content>
