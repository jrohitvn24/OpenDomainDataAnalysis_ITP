		<title>07THE NEW ROAD &amp; LOUISA CENTRE</title>
		<content> In 1979 a new road was built from     
 Stanley to Chester-le-street.The road 
 was built to attract new businesses to
 the area,because it connects to the   
 A1(M) so that they can get supplies in
 and products out with great speed.    
 The road was jointly funded by the EEC
 and DCC and cost Â£7 million to build. 
 The Louisa Centre                     
 Stanley sports centre was opened      
 18/4/80.There are 2 instructors and a 
 manager.It costs Â£5 to join for adults
 and Â£3 for juniors and Â£9 for a       
 family.On average 3700 people attend  
 the centre every week.There are 12    
 different sports played and in the    
 summer there is a play scheme for     
 children.The centre is called the     
 Louisa becaues it was built on the pit
 head.In 1947 28 people were killed.   
 It was said to be a methane gas       
 explosion.                            </content>
