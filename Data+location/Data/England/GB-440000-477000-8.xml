		<content>    One farmer's wife offered the      
 following comments.She said that      
 farmers are often regarded by the     
 general public as the fortunate,      
 affluent community living in the      
 countryside, in fresh air, and away   
 from fuel fumes, dust and the         
 everlasting noise of traffic.         
    Farmers in our block cannot claim  
 these privileges, with an airfield, a 
 heavily used Trunk road, and a main   
 railway line from Newcastle to London,
 crossing the area.                    
    We are living in a highly          
 competitive era. Supermarket          
 purchasing policies, freezers,        
 microwave ovens have all combined to  
 put the entire food spectrum in a     
 different league. There is a          
 noticeable change in our sense of     
 taste, and our younger generation do  
 not enjoy the tastes of our forbears. </content>
