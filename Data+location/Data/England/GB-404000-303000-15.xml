		<title>15CLAYHANGER:REACTION TO PLANS</title>
		<content>   Clayhanger people's reactions to    
 the proposed plans for the area were  
 assessed following the completion of a
 questionnaire sent to village         
 residents. Replies indicated          
 opposition to the various schemes,the 
 majority being in favour of Clayhanger
 remaining as it is now.               
   Respondents emphasised the need to  
 retain the village's separate         
 identity and prevent it becoming part 
 of Brownhills and Pelsall.Furthermore,
 they wished to preserve its peaceful  
 nature which makes it attractive to   
 wild life.                            
   Residents objected most strongly to 
 the housing and opencast mining,seeing
 the alternative road as less of a     
 threat to the local community.Despite 
 such opposition,few householders were 
 ready to leave Clayhanger if the plans
 were implemented.                     </content>
