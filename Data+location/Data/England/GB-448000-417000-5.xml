		<title>05THE RIVER WENT &amp; WENT HILLS.</title>
		<content>     The River Went has its source in  
 a spring in Featherstone. From there  
 it flows through a wide valley until  
 it reaches the Went Hills. It crosses 
 Thorp Marsh, where its course has been
 straightened, and then through        
 Wentbridge, where the old A1 crosses  
 it by the bridge that gave the village
 its name. From there it enters a      
 narrow valley with the limestone crags
 of Brockadale on the north and Smeaton
 Crags to the south.                   
    The waters of the River are very   
 clean and support a wide variety of   
 wildlife. The river is also popular   
 with fishermen as well as with those  
 who enjoy walking in the beautiful    
 countryside alongside the river. There
 are plenty of footpaths open to the   
 public.                               
    The present A1 crosses the valley  
 by a viaduct.                         </content>
