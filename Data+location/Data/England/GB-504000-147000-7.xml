		<content>   There are two chapels, St.Nicholas  
 Chapel and the Bray Chapel. The St.   
 Nicholas Chapel was built in the 14th 
 century and the Bray Chapel contains  
 the memorials to the Bray family who  
 have been Lords of the Manor of Shere 
 since 1487.                           
   On the north wall of the chancel can
 be seen the quatrefoil and squint     
 which were part of a cell built on the
 outside of the church to house        
 Christine Carpenter,an anchoress who  
 was enclosed by permission of the     
 Bishop of Winchester in 1329. The     
 squint provided her with a view of the
 alter and through the quatrefoil she  
 received communion. The cell itself   
 has been demolished but its outlines  
 can still be seen on the outside of   
 the north wall.                       
   The church today is well attended,it
 has a choir and team of bell-ringers. </content>
