		<title>09EARDINGTON SHROPSHIRE</title>
		<content>{ Eardington}is a small linear village 
 about 1\ miles from Bridgnorth.It lies
 on the west bank of the R.Severn, on a
 minor road leading from the B4364.To  
 the east of the village runs the      
{Severn Valley Steam Railway},a popular
 tourist attraction.                   
  The village is{mainly residential,   
 including a fair number of retired    
 folk.The few jobs available are in the
 shop /post office,the abbatoir and on 
 surrounding farms.It also has a coach 
 depot for a local small company.Many  
 of the residents commute to the West  
 Midlands conurbation and Bridgnorth.  
 Eardington used to have a pub called  
 the Red Crown but it has closed down. 
 (Shame!).A recent addition to the     
 village has been the building of a    
 group of retirement homes linked to a 
 warden's house.
