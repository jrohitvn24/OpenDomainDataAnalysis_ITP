  In 1585 a series of remarkable       
voyages from Britain began to attempt  
to establish the first colony in North 
America. For 21 years the country's    
best efforts were in vain, until in    
1606 a small fleet of three ships left 
Blackwall in the Thames to become the  
founders of North America. The ships   
were the Discovery, the Godspeed and   
the Susan Constant. All arrived safely.
The voyage had been proposed by a      
Suffolk man, Bartholomew Gosnold. He   
had sailed to the New World four years 
before. He chose to be master of the   
middle-sized ship the Godspeed. To     
judge  by her design, this ship was the
most seaworthy. Gosnold's family home  
was Otley Hall.
