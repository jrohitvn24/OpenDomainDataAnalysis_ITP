   Our school sent out a questionnaire 
to all our parents and friends of the  
school.                                
   We found that the largest group of  
men worked in manufacturing industry   
or in building. The largest group of   
women worked as housewives or had a    
part-time job in a shop or as a nurse. 
A few people said that they worked     
as managers or directors.              
                                       
   Of the people who replied to the    
question on family income:             
                                       
  3  had between  1000 and  5000       
  3  had between  5000 and  8000       
  11 had between  8000 and 10000       
  14 had between 10000 and 15000       
  12 had over 15000
