		<title>07MRS ALCOCKS' DAY IN HOLT</title>
		<content>{THE MORNING                           
 Mrs Alcock gets up at 6-30am and      
 collects the animals for market.      
 Afterwards she milks her only house   
 cow and feeds the calves. She then has
 breakfast and does odd jobs about the 
 farm. At 10-00am the animals are taken
 to market. Mrs Alcock does fencing    
 until 2-30pm and then has lunch for   
 half an hour.                         
{AFTERNOON AND EVENING                 
 After lunch she does fencing again    
 because it is very important the      
 cattle don't get out. At 5-00pm she   
 feeds the cows. At 6-00pm she mends   
 any equipment that needs attention    
 until 9-30pm, when she goes to bed.   
{ABOUT HER FARM                        
 She has about fifteen cattle. She also
 has two dogs and a cat. All her beef  
 cattle are devonshires and her house  
 cow is a friesan.                     </content>
