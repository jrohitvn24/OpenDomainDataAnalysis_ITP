		<title>11"Bowcombe"-Local Issues 2</title>
		<content>   From the point of view of           
 inhabitants of the area other than    
 farmers, one burning issue; quite     
 literally, is that of the old practice
 of farmers of burning the corn stubble
 after the crop has been harvested. Not
 only does this yield all the dangers  
 normally associated with fire and     
 smoke, and on a large scale, but there
 is also an aftermath which is not     
 always realised: that of fine black   
 ash which, born on the wind; "can     
 cover every surface in a house and a  
 garden, even into the furthest        
 recesses, and is extremely difficult  
 to remove".                           
  {Another vital issue of contemporary 
{national concern is that of the use by
{farmers of chemical fertilisers and   
{insecticides, and aerial spraying in  
{particular. Some fear that there may  
{be unforeseen effects upon health.}   </content>
