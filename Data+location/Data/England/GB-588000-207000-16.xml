		<title>16GOLDHANGER - BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>  Number 2 Fish Street, Goldhanger     
 used to a bakers.One could tell       
 because it had big windows made out of
 squares of glass.Number 4 Fish Street 
 used to be a butchers which only  sold
 one type of meat. Number 6 on were    
 normal houses. Number 13 caught my eye
 because the garage was an unusual     
 shape.Opposite was a brand new        
 house which was faced with plaster and
 pargetted.In Fish Street there are    
 some lovely cottages.They looked about
 80 years old. The house was like a    
 house that  children draw with four   
 windows  a door in the middle  you    
 could tell it was old because some of 
 the bricks were falling of the        
 chimney. Below each window were       
 window boxes full of flowers which    
 made the house look like a typical    
 olde worlde country cottage.
