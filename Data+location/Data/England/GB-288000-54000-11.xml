		<title>11Lupton  House</title>
		<content> Lupton House stands in the centre of  
 the square; this was the home         
 of Lord and Lady Churston. It is now a
 school for disturbed children. The    
 afforestation in this area is quite   
 extensive with 31% deciduous trees of 
 the beech and sycamore variety plus a 
 small selection of nearly every tree  
 found in the British Isles. There is  
 61% rough grazing and 8% housing. The 
 buses from Brixham and Kingswear also 
 go through this area. Extensive       
 housing and house building is going on
 in the Summercombe area, these are    
 mainly occupied by commuters to the   
 local towns.
