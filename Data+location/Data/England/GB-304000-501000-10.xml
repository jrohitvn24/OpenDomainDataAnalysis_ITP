		<content> We were going on a boat outing to     
 Wastwater.Wastwater is dangerous so   
 we took our life jackets.I found out  
 James was coming with us.I pleaded    
 with my dad not to let him come,but he
 came.When we reached the island there 
 were nests with eggs in.We hurried off
 the island rowing as fast as we could.
 We dropped my brother off and James   
 and I went for a cruise.A big wave hit
 us.Both the oars were in the water.We 
 had got one oar back so we skulled to 
 shore.About half an hour later we had 
 searched as far as we could.When we   
 came back we found that a canoist had 
 returned the other oar.               
                                       
  Most weekends my dad and I prepare to
 go on the sea with the canoes.You need
 to wear a spraydeck and life jacket.  
 When we arrive at the beach we jump   
 out.                                  </content>
