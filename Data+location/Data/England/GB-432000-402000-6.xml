		<content>{BRITISH BULLDOG}can be played with as 
 many people as you want.  Then you    
 decide who is on.  The rest of the    
 people run to the end of the street.  
 When the person who is on shouts      
 'British Bulldog 1,2,3,' the rest of  
 the people run to the other end of    
 the street without being caught by the
 person who is on.  If you are caught, 
 you have to be on with the other      
 person.  If one person stops at the   
 end of the street they are allowed 10 
 seconds to get past the person who is 
 on and if they don't move they are    
 automatically out. The first person   
 who was out has to be on in the next  
 game.
