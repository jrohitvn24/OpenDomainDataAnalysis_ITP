		<title>14Attitudes in Brafferton</title>
		<content>    On the whole people enjoy living in
 the area - indeed Brafferton village  
 itself is a very desirable place as it
 is in easy commuting range of         
 Darlington and Newton Aycliffe. People
 like the peace and privacy that the   
 village life gives as well as the     
 surprising degree of isolation on the 
 farms.                                
                                       
    However there is a ceratin amount  
 of inconvenience from the fact that   
 there is no{shop}in the area though a 
 travelling shop does visit the        
 village.                              
                                       
    Some people do feel that there is  
 not enough for{young people}to do in  
 the area and instead they have to go  
 to Darlington for entertainment. But  
 without their own transport many do   
 find village life boring.             </content>
