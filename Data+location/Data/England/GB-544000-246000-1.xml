		<title>01A Review Of The Area</title>
		<content> There are 3 small villages in the     
 block, all of which are reasonably    
 traffic free. However, outside the    
 villages there are a few very busy    
 roads. There is the{A505}and the{M11  
 and there is also a{Cambridge to      
{London main railway line.}There are 4 
 churches, 3 schools and some farms in 
 our block, proving that farming is a  
 common occupation. Woodland covers    
 large sections of our block. There is 
 a public footpath from Whittlesford to
 Thriplow. There are 3 industrial      
 firms -{Volvo British Motors, Ciba    
{Geigy Agro Chemicals,}and{Smart's Mill
 (which stores grain).                 
{Duxford Airfield}is part of the       
 Imperial War Museum. The housing is   
 centered on the 3 villages, and the   
 4x3 km block is not thickly populated.
