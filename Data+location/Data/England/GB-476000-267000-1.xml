		<title>01The landscape near Holcot.</title>
		<content>     The area lies some seven miles to 
 the north of the town of{Northampton. 
   The land rises gently from the south
 but falls away in the north toward the
 great expanse of water at{Pitsford    
{Reservoir.                            
    The reservoir supplies water to the
 nearby town of Northampton.It is also 
 a popular{leisure centre}for fishing, 
 water sports and bird watching.       
    Most of the undulating landscape is
 devoted to agriculture.About two      
 thirds of the area is covered by      
 fields and crops of various kinds.    
    Low population and open countryside
 has resulted in the area being able to
 support a wide variety of wildlife.   
    To the north-east lies Holcot, a   
 village built of Northamptonshire     
 stone, with a population of about 34O.
   Holcot was mentioned in the Domesday
 book of King William.                 </content>
