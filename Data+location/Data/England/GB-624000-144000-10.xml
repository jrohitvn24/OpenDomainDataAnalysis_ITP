		<title>10Leisure activities-Lydden</title>
		<content>1)My hobby is riding.I ride my pony    
called Min.She is 20 years old.She is a
cross breed.I have won 36 rosettes and 
5 medals,all on Min.My mum has a horse 
called Prince.He is a chestnut and he  
is 6 years old.My dad is a jockey and  
he rides in point to point races.I ride
out with my friend Alison.My dad owns a
farm in Lydden and I help by riding    
around the fields.                     
2)On Saturdays I go window shopping    
with my mum.Sometimes mum takes me to  
Russell Gardens and Bushy Ruff.It's    
lovely there but most of all I like to 
go in the car to see the horse.        
Sometimes we go on a day trip to       
France.When it's a nice day we go to   
the sea for a swim but mum hardly ever 
comes in,she says it is too cold.We    
also go to the swimming pool in Dover. 
We enjoy going for walks to places that
we have never been to before.          </content>
