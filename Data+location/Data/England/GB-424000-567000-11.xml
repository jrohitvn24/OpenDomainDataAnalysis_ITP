		<content> GOSFORTH GARDEN VILLAGE               
                                       
 Residents agree that it is pleasant to
 live there due to the village         
 atmosphere and being near to          
 Newcastle.                            
                                       
 There are improved transport          
 facilities (bus and metro). Many      
 residents dislike the heavy traffic in
 Hollwood Ave. Some think it's partly  
 due to the Regent Metro Station.      
                                       
 A few complain of the large number of 
 cars parked in the streets at night.  
 Householders in Cheswick Drive disloke
 the high level of noise from the Metro
 depot.
