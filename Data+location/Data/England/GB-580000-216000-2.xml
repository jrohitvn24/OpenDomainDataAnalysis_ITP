		<content>   The village shop is a small family  
 business offering a personal service  
 to the local community.Deliveries are 
 made on request to any who are elderly
 or unwell.The stock is suited to the  
 needs of local people for example;    
 basic foods, newspapers, magazines,   
 cigarettes and household goods.A video
 library also operates from the village
 shop.The busiest time of day is       
 between 3.30 p.m. and 4.30 p.m.       
 because children are leaving school at
 this time. Paper boys deliver         
 newspapers and magazines from the shop
 each morning. Accounting and details  
 of stock are dealt with manually.     
 Nothing in the shop is computerised.  
 The shop has never been broken into   
 but occasionally items have been taken
 by shoplifters.
