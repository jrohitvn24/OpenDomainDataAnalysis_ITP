 We were interviewing an old lady from 
Hill Top. she has lived there since    
1929, she came from Finedon.           
 When she was first there they had no  
electricity. They were connected in    
1939. They had no water and there was  
no kitchen when they first moved in.   
They washed their clothes in the wash  
house.The bedroom is downstairs.       
 They had to go 2 or 3 miles to the    
shops. She travelled by bus and it was 
mostly full.The bus was very frequent. 
 Years ago Old doctor Burton used to   
come when needed by horse and cart.
