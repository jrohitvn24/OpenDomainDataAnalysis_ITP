		<content>          A little while back on the   
 4th. July, six children out of our    
 class (Fairlie School, Skelmersdale)  
 went for a walk along the canal at    
 Parbold. We started off from a new    
 bridge. It was near an animal feed    
 factory. We walked for abot 2 minutes 
 and came across a barge painted up. We
 noticed a few dead fish. We came to a 
 bridge with a number which was 38. We 
 walked past some houses that backed   
 on to the canal. Soon we passed a     
 person fishing and came to another    
 bridge _ this time number 39.         
          The next bridge was number   
 40, and above the canal to the north  
 was the railway and to the south the  
 River Douglas.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
