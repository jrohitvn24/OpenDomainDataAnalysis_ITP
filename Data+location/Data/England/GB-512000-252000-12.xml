		<title>12A Visit to the Dentist.</title>
		<content> If you go to the dentist you usually  
 make an appointment.First I  had to   
 wait in the waiting room until I was  
 called into the surgery.There was a   
 big chair to sit in.The dentist can   
 make it go up and down.He has lots of 
 instruments;some of them are called   
 probes.I had to have a filling because
 my tooth had decayed.First he gave me 
 an injection.I felt a slight prick and
 then my lips felt cold.The nurse held 
 an instrument called an aspirator in  
 my mouth.This made my mouth go dry.   
 Then the dentist squirted the hole    
 with air.This made sure that the tooth
 was dry as he drilled out the decay.  
 Then the nurse mixed some silver in a 
 special  machine.This was to fill the 
 hole.When the hole was filled he asked
 me to bite my teeth together.I could  
 not feel the filling which meant that 
 it was level.Then it was soon over.   </content>
