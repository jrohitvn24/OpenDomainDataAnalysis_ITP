		<title>11WORKING MEN'S CLUBS</title>
		<content> WHEN WE TOURED OUR AREA IN THE SCHOOL 
 BUS WE COUNTED 16 WORKING MEN'S CLUBS.
 THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE BECAUSE WE    
 DIDN'T TRAVEL ALONG EVERY ROAD. THE   
 NEAREST ONE TO OUR SCHOOL IS THE      
 SWAITHE W.M.C. AND WE ASKED THE       
 SECRETARY ABOUT IT. HE SAID THE CLUB  
 OPENED IN 1957 AND THAT IT WAS OPEN   
 EVERY DAY AT LUNCHTIME AND AT NIGHT.  
 THERE WAS A MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE OF   
 17, A STEWARD AND HIS WIFE. 4 BAR     
 STAFF AND 3 CLEANERS. THERE WAS A     
 MEMBERSHIP OF ABOUT 3OOO, AND REGULAR 
 ACTIVITIES INCLUDED POOL, BINGO, CARDS
 AND DARTS. REGULAR MUSICAL AND CONCERT
 EVENING ARE HELD AND DANCING EVERY    
 FRIDAY. THERE WAS ALSO A BOWLS SECTION
 AND A FOOTBALL CLUB, AND EVERY YEAR A 
 CHILDREN'S OUTING WAS ORGANISED TO THE
 SEA-SIDE.
