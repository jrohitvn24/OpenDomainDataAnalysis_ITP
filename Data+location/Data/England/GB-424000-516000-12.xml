		<content> When the trains went past they made   
 seeds fly to each side of the track   
 and all the trees grew there.Now the  
 railway track has grown over with     
 grass and trees.The thing that stops  
 it from being a nice place is the     
 rubbish.People just throw old carpets 
 and things out instead of taking it to
 the local tip.They could phone        
 Durham County Council to take it      
 away.The railway used to run from     
 Darlington to Barnard Castle.The      
 railway used to go underneath the A1M 
 motorway but there is a tip there now 
 because the farmer wanted his two     
 fields attached together the  name of 
 the farmer is Mr.Mac Andrews he lives 
 in Hall Farm Archdeacon Newton.
