		<title>02BORDON GARRISON</title>
		<content> The area around Bordon has been used  
 as a training area for troops from    
 Aldershot since the middle of the     
 nineteenth century. In 1903 it was a  
 garrison for troops awaiting          
 demobilisation after the Boer War. It 
 was connected to nearby Longmoor Camp 
 by a Military Railway Training Centre 
 providing local railway transport for 
 civilians as well as military.        
     After 1968 it became the          
 Headquarters of the School of         
 Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.
 Normally it is a short stay training  
 area and the tour of duty is not more 
 than two years. After training, troops
 are generally posted to Germany.      
     The garrison is very much         
 integrated into the life of the       
 village. Indeed the village itself    
 grew up as a service centre for the   
 troops.                               </content>
