 There are three little hamlets in this
 block, Trenance, Porthoustock and     
 Rosenithon.  Porthoustock has three   
 'Coast Guard Cottages' which used to  
 be a Coast Guard station and housed   
 the Coast Guard and his family.  They 
 are now council houses.  There is     
 still a Coast Guard lookout post. The 
 MOD have an observation post at       
 Porthkerris point as well as a radar  
 station half a mile inland. This is   
 out of bounds to the public with an   
 electric fence and radiation warning  
 signs.  There is one food and         
 ice-cream shop at Porthoustock. Most  
 houses are now owner occupied though  
 they were originally built for        
 quarrymen and fishermen.  These       
 hamlets are particularly quaint having
 beautiful gardens with some thatched  
 roofed cottages.                      </content>
