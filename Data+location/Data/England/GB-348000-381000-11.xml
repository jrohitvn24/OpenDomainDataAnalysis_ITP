		<title>11School Sports Day</title>
		<content> At Weston Point School we have a      
 sports day competition in the summer  
 at the end of term.We have four teams 
 Mond,Brunner,Kellner and Castner.We   
 have races and our parents and        
 relatives are invited to watch.A      
 typical game which we play is Stop The
 Waiter where we have to stop the      
 waiter from getting across the balance
 by throwing bean bags at him or her   
 while the waiter is carrying cups of  
 water and at the end of the           
 balance there is a bucket and the team
 with most water in their bucket is the
 winner.Then we end with a tug o       
 war competition.Then the team with the
 most points wins the trophey.In 1984  
 Brunner won.And in 1985 Castner won.
