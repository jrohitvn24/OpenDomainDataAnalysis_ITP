		<content> It all starts in playgroup when you   
 are three years old. Playgroup helps  
 young children get used to being with 
 other people and sharing things with  
 them.                                 
 At the age of five the children come  
 to the First school. It is not a very 
 big school, it has three classes and  
 three teachers, one of them being the 
 headmistress. It has a large dining   
 room which is also used for drama and 
 P.E. We have swimming lessons every   
 Tuesday morning for the older         
 children. We study different project  
 work each half term.                  
 Every year we have an Easter Fair and 
 a Sponsored Walk to raise money for   
 school funds. We sometimes go on trips
 to the theatre to museums or other    
 places of interest.                   
 At nine we go to Corbridge Middle and 
 at thirteen to Hexham High School.    </content>
