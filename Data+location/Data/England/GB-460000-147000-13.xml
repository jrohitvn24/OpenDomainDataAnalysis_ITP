		<title>13SW BASINGSTOKE: FAMILIES 1</title>
		<content> Most of the families in our area have 
 a mum, dad and two or three           
 children. They usually own a car and  
 often visit relations at weekends.Most
 people have few relatives close by.   
 Usually the father goes to work and   
 now many  mothers are working when    
 children are at school, or work       
 nights. The children often do things  
 on their own or with friends in their 
 spare time: watching T.V. is popular, 
 and playing out on bikes is too.In the
 evenings some children belong to Cubs 
 or Brownies or sports clubs. One hobby
 is collecting things; stamps,flowers, 
 toy cars, stickers, rubbers. Children 
 enjoy sweets and some parents smoke   
 cigarettes. Our 7 and 8 year old      
 friends go to bed at 8pm and get up at
 7am. Some parents go to the pub or the
 cinema or theatre in the evening while
 a babysitter looks after the children.</content>
