		<content> These are some of the games we played:
 PEG LEG - one person at the top and   
 the rest of the people down the       
 bottom. The one on his own calls a    
 person and they go up and hop on one  
 leg and the first person tries to push
 them over and while they are doing it 
 they say "Peg Leg". SKIPPING - "I like
 coffee, I like tea, I like Becca in   
 with me. I don't like coffee, I don't 
 like tea, I don't like Becca in with  
 me". NINE NINE IN - one's IT and the  
 others hide. When counter is out      
 looking for them somebody can run to  
 the post and say "nine nine out       
 myself". FRENCH SKIPPING - just the   
 same as ELASTICS. DALLAS - is a       
 programme on TV.  We just pretend to  
 play it and be the actors.            
 We also play POLO, BLACK MAGIC, HIDE  
 AND SEEK, LONDON and WHITE HORSES.
