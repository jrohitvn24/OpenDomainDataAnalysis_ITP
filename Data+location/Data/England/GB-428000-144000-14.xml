		<title>14AMPORT &amp; THRUXTON SCHOOLS.</title>
		<content>  There are two village Primary schools
 in the area, Amport &amp; Kimpton. Amport 
 was built in 1815 to enable the poor  
 children of the parish to learn to    
 read, write &amp; come to know the Church 
 Catechism. The school Log Books,      
 dating from 1878, record the work of 6
 Head Teachers. Kimpton was opened on  
 the 26th April, 1966 and later        
 dedicated by the Bishop of Winchester.
 It replaced schools at Thruxton and   
 Kimpton. It has its own swimming pool.
  Both schools are Church Aided, under 
 the joint control of the Diocese of   
 Winchester &amp; the Hampshire Education  
 Authority. Kimpton is the larger. Tony
 Battye, the Headmaster, has a staff of
 4.2, himself, his Deputy Head, two    
 assistants plus a peripatetic teaching
 one day a week. Tom Hiscock, Amport,  
 has a Deputy Head, Infant Teacher &amp; a 
 part-timer (0.2) to teach 70 children.</content>
