		<title>19The Village of Gayles</title>
		<content>  Gayles, derived from the Celtic name 
 Gallia "ia" - a land or territory and 
 "gall" - a stranger, is divided into  
 three separate streets; Middle, East &amp;
 West. In between each street is a     
 substantial open area, although the   
 original form has been changed in     
 recent years by the small modern      
 development of stone built bungalows  
 and houses. East Street is much as it 
 was in the 19th century. The Bay Horse
 public house is the only facility in  
 the village, although a regular bus   
 service operates Monday to Saturday   
 between Richmond and Barnard Castle.  
  The working population are employed  
 in agriculture,local government,the   
 Civil Service or transport and        
 utilities. Owing to its isolated      
 position, it is unlikely that this    
 small village will be permitted to    
 enlarge its boundaries in the future. </content>
