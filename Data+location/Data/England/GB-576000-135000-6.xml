		<content> Most of the farms deal with           
hops,fruit  and cereals.Livestock such 
as sheep, pigs and cattle are kept on  
some farms. Horses are reared at       
Goddards Green stud.The hop gardens for
a long time a feature of this area have
declined in recent years.              
Fruit,especially apples,cherries and   
strawberries are sent to London or to  
local markets.                         
Some farmers have found it more        
profitable to adopt a "pick your own"  
method of selling thereby avoiding     
unnecessary costs.Farm sizes average   
from 50 to 500 acres.They are well     
stocked with equipment,many farmers    
find that common market policies have  
effected their policies,and forced them
to change what they farm.This has in   
some cases led to a decline in hop and 
apple growing,and a reduction in some  
dairy farming.                         </content>
