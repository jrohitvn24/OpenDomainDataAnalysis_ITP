		<title>11Farming Machinery</title>
		<content> The most expensive piece of machinery 
 which is  used at Bagley Farm in 1985 
 is the{combine harvester}which, when  
 new, costs around{Â£60,000.}The  farmer
 prefers the{baler}which makes round   
 bales to the one which makes square   
 bales because they can use a{fork lift
 for handling  round bales but the     
 square bales have to have men to lift 
 them and this is heavy work. He owns {
{4 tractors}one of which is a fork lift
 tractor. He keeps his tractors for    
 about four or five years before he    
 changes them.A tractor can  cost{     
{Â£12000.}Other implements he uses      
 include a{plough,}which is used to    
 turn over the land and a  {power      
{harrow,}which is used to make  a fine 
 seed  bed.A power harrow costs{Â£3000.}
 If any machinery breaks down he will  
 repair it himself but if it is a      
 serious fault he will ask a mechanic. </content>
