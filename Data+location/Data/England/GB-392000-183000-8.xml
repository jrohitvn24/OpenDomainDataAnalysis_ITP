		<title>08The Old Buildings Of Corston</title>
		<content>     We were shown around the village  
 by{Mr. Ted Jones,}who has lived in    
 Corston for{forty-nine years.}Most of 
 the houses are built around the main  
 road, or the coaching road as it is   
 called.                               
     There was a quarry down Common    
 Road, but the poor quality stone was  
 used to fill in the old roads. Better 
 building stone came from near by      
 Rodbourne. Many of the buildings have 
 changed their use. The{Old Bell Inn,  
{closed after World War l,}the post    
 office and mill, built in 1565, are   
 now houses. The mill leat has been    
 filled in .{The Zion Chapel built in  
{1857}has also been converted into a   
 house and the graveyard into a garden.
 There is also another disused chapel  
 which is in ruins and it's grounds    
 overgrown.                            
                                       </content>
