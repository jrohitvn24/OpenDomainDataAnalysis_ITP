		<title>04THE WATER SUPPLY-RIVER SWIFT</title>
		<content>{The River Swift}used to be much deeper
 than it is now, and was used as the   
 water supply for the village.Most of  
 the houses along the valley still have
 wells in their gardens, and although  
 some wells have been boarded up,      
 others feature as garden ornaments.   
 There are old photographs of floods in
 Church Street, and in the 19th century
 2 people and a pig were drowned in the
 river.                                
 A pumping station has been built      
 between{Ibthorpe}and{Upton}which pumps
 water into a covered reservoir on Pill
 Heath. This supplements the{Andover   
 water supply and reduces the flow of  
 the{River Swift}to below flood level. 
 Many of the valley houses, and the    
 church, had walls as protection       
 against flood water.
