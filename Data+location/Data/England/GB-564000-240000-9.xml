		<title>09Bower Hall Estate.</title>
		<content> The fine{18th Century Hall}built in   
 1720 on the site of a previous Hall   
 was demolished stone by stone in 1926 
 and taken to{America}and rebuilt.  All
 that remains now are the foundations  
 and part of the original Estate wall. 
 The former{Lodge House}is still used  
 today. Also,the stables were sold and 
 thatched as cottages.  Later an       
 upstairs was added to provide 5       
 cottages. One cottage has a boarded up
{well}in the garden. The present       
{farmhouse}is sited on and incorporates
 some of the original outbuildings. The
 present lounge was the{Cattle Shed}and
 now has a false floor and ceiling.    
 The kitchen was the{Storeroom. }The   
 present accommodation has had various 
 additions and now forms an L-shape.   
 The farm comprises 120 acres and is   
 farmed by Mr. Haylock, his son and one
 other.  They grow Cereals and Beans.  </content>
