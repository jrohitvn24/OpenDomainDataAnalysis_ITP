		<content>   Traffic was monitored at the        
 roundabout at the junction of         
 Shawfield Road, Wharf Road, Ash Hill  
 Road and Ash Vale Road. The Volume of 
 traffic at this junction has increased
 considerably over the past few years  
 and is causing local residents much   
 concern as the children from          
 Shawfields First School and Heathcote 
 Middle School have to cross here to   
 get to school. There are no pedestrian
 crossings and no crossing patrol.     
   A survey of traffic was carried out 
 by Shawfield's children on the l9th   
 July 1985 from 8.30 to 9.15am. They   
 found that the volume of traffic in   
 Vale Road was 1600 vehicles per hour  
 and on a road this size 1800-2000 is  
 rated capacity. During the survey 304 
 (approx 400 per hour) people (mainly  
 children) tried to cross the road.
