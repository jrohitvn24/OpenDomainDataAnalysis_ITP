		<content>   During  April and May we visited{Mr.
{Newmans butcher's shop and Tanner's   
{Dairy}to ask questions about their    
 work.{Mr.Newman}showed us the         
 slaughter house,where he slaughters   
 the animals and keeps them until they 
 are ready to cut up and sell. He keeps
 some animals in the huge freezer in   
 the slaughter house.                  
   At{Tanners Dairy}we found it was    
 very big and noisy. It was very messy 
 too!there was water and milk all over 
 the floor. There were great big       
 machines and tanks. They deliver milk 
 to places all over Suffolk and North  
 Essex using a fleet of large lorries. 
 They work seven days a week.          
   We were given a bottle of milk each 
 to drink, we all enjoyed that.
