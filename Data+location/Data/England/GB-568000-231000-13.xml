		<content>     In our area the farmer starts by  
 ploughing the field so that it turns  
 the soil over. Next comes a harrow    
 pulled by a tractor which breaks up   
 the lumps of soil. Then comes the     
 drill which plants the seeds into the 
 soil.Then the soil is rolled flat by  
 heavy rollers.                        
     Some crops are planted in autumn  
 and grow over winter,others are       
 drilled in the spring time.Spraying is
 carried out at various times during   
 the growing season, to protect the    
 crop from weeds,mostly by tractor.    
    In autumn the farmer uses a combine
 harvester which cuts and threshes the 
 corn. Tractors come with trailers to  
 take away the grain.This is stored in 
 large bins then sold.The straw left on
 the field is either baled for cattle  
 bedding or more commonly nowadays     
 burnt with the stubble.               </content>
