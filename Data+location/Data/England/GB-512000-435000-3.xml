		<content> The villages of Coniston and Swine in 
 Holderness lie on the eastern edge of 
 the Hull valley. The landscape is low 
 lying with the large open fields      
 typical of the plain of Holderness    
 with its thick strata of boulder clay 
 overlaying the chalk base. The only   
 buildings of any note in Coniston are 
 the modern village hall and the local 
 inn, 'The Blacksmiths' Arms'. However,
 Swine boasts a fine church, parts of  
 which date from 1150 when a priory    
 church of Cistercian nuns was         
 established on the site. Apart from   
 the two villages, the only other      
 buildings in this typically rural     
 backwater are nine residential units  
 and twelve farms scattered over the   
 countryside.
