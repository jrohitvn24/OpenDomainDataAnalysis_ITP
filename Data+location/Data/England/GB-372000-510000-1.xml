		<title>01The Parish of Soulby</title>
		<content> The block corresponds approximately to
 the Parish of Soulby, with the village
 towards the SE corner. The land falls 
 from 750' in the NW to 450' in the SE,
 down to the valley of the River Eden. 
 The dozen or so farms in the area are 
 primarily concerned with milk         
 production, but almost all also run a 
 flock of sheep. Consequently          
 cultivation is almost entirely of     
 grassland, with the occasional field  
 used for fodder grain. Apart from the 
 odd small copse or windbreak, there is
 no woodland but hedgerows &amp; roadside  
 verges have many trees in great       
 variety. The village of Soulby, little
 changed since the war, is a farming   
 village, split into two unequal parts 
 by Scandal Beck. Extensive village    
 greens on either side of the beck are 
 cropped by horses, goats and geese.
