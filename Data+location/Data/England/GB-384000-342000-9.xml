		<title>09Interview with Stoke lady</title>
		<content>Mrs Hancock said that she liked living 
in Stoke and that she would not move.  
The shops are very close and so she can
walk to them to do her shopping.She did
say that she would like more clothes   
shops.                                 
  Living near to factories did not     
bother her.Her husband works at the    
Michelin factory and she works at Stoke
police station.                        
  Mrs Hancock lives near to the        
football ground.She doesn't like the   
fact that people park their cars along 
her street.Also after a match there is 
a lot of litter.                       
  In the evenings,she said,that there  
was plenty to do.There are plenty of   
pubs and social clubs to go to.
