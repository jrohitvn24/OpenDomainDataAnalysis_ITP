		<title>17BOBBIN LACE WEAVING,S IN A.</title>
		<content>   In Victorian times bobbin lace was  
 woven in their homes by poor women and
 children,often as young as 5,in an    
 attempt to earn extra money.Today,you 
 can see beautiful examples of this    
 craft in Brussels.It is quite easy to 
 master the craft.All you need are     
 card,steel,pins,wire,scissors and     
 beads.Traditionally bobbins are       
 spangled to weigh and tension the lace
 and to allow for individual designs.It
 is still taught in village schools but
 my mother learnt at a Sutton Centre   
 night class.She is a member of the    
 Lace Society where she can see lace   
 made,displayed and buy materials.She  
 has made lace collars,bookmarks,table 
 mats and paperweights.
