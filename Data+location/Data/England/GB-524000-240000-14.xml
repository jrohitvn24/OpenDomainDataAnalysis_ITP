		<title>14THE ASHWELL SHOW</title>
		<content> The Ashwell show is organised by a    
 committee of people from Ashwell and  
 the surrounding villages. The members 
 are local businessmen doctors and     
 farmers about fifteen in all. They    
 meet about once a month to plan the   
 show. It is always held on August Bank
 Holiday Monday. It is such a large    
 undertaking that anything up to a     
 hundred and fifty helpers spend the   
 previous two days getting the fields  
 ready. The attendance over the last   
 two years has been in the region of   
 six to seven thousand and the profit  
 between five and six thousand         
 pounds.The profits are distributed on 
 the basis of discussions held by the  
 committee in the Autumn. Local        
 ammenities and like the village hall, 
 museum and church receive donations as
 do organisations like the P.T.A.who   
 help on the day.                      </content>
