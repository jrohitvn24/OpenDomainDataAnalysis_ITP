		<title>03THE CLIMATE OF WEST CAMBS.</title>
		<content>     The range of temperatures in the  
 area is one of the most extreme in the
 country.   Summers are warm, with     
 maximum temperatures in July averaging
 22 deg.C, but night frosts occur from 
 September until May, often making side
 roads treacherous in winter.   Snow   
 generally falls for about one week per
 year, with drifts sometimes causing   
 problems on exposed stretches of road.
                                       
    The prevailing south-westerly winds
 have less effect so far East, and this
 makes the area drier and less windy   
 than most of the country.   Fogs are  
 common in autumn and winter, although 
 less severe than in the river valleys 
 to the North and South of the area.
