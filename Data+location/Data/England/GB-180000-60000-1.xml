		<title>01Newquay-An Introduction</title>
		<content>    Newquay is a coastal town situated 
 on a peninsula close to the estuary of
 the River Gannel.Originally the town  
 developed around the harbour but due  
 to the influence of the tourist trade 
 the town has expanded in a linear     
 pattern along the main east-west axis 
 for about three miles.                
                                       
    The population of the town is      
 approximately 15,600 permanent        
 residents.During the season,however,  
 this figure is boosted by holiday     
 makers to about 100,000.Consequently, 
 the services of the town are aimed at 
 that figure.There is a large fire     
 station with four mobiles and a       
 district police station with well over
 100 officers in the summer months.Bus,
 rail and coach services,extensive in  
 the summer,are reduced to skeleton    
 schedules in the winter.              </content>
