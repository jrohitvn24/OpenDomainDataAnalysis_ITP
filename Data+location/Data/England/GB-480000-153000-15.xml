		<title>15FLEET CARNIVAL IMPRESSIONS</title>
		<content> The floats{(decorated lorries)}were   
 ready and the atmosphere was very     
 exciting. At 7pm the procession       
 started. It began with a fire-engine, 
 some police motor-bikes with flashing 
 lights and a steamroller. The{theme}  
 this year was music, and many floats  
 illustrated musicals such as{Thriller,
{Starlight Express, Fame and The Wizard
{of Oz.}                               
 Hats, badges, leaflets, balloons,     
 stickers and sweets were given out and
 money was collected for charities such
 as{Cancer Research}and{RSPCA.}There   
 were troops of majorettes and bands   
 such as the{Gurkhas.}The Carnival     
 Queen was Tracey Anderson and the     
 Princess was Emma Robson. Everyone was
 laughing by the time the Carnival     
 ended at 9pm because they had all     
 enjoyed themselves. All the hard work 
 that had gone into it, was worthwhile.</content>
