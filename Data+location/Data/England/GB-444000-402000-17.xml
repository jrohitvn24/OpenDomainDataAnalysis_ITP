		<title>17CELEBRATIONS IN GOLDTHORPE</title>
		<content> My Grandma can remember all this      
 happening in{May 1945.}Just about     
 everybody was sitting round the radio 
 listening for news of the end of{World
{War II.}When it came through everybody
 jumped for joy, screaming, crying and 
 shouting. Then there were bonfires,   
 fireworks, parties and flags hanging  
 out of windows and across streets.    
 People went to Pubs. Many got drunk to
 celebrate the{Victory.}There were     
 large numbers of people killed or     
 injured in the War. This year we have 
 had the{40th Anniversary}of the       
 celebrations. T.V.A.M. had a party to 
 celebrate the Anniversary on          
 television. It was organised outside  
 the T.V.A.M. studio in London, tables 
 were set out in a V shape.  In the    
 Goldthorpe area there were very few   
 celebrations of the Anniversary.
