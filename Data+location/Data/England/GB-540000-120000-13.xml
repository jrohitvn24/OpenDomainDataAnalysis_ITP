		<title>13MY SCHOOL DAY Part 1</title>
		<content> My name is Christine and I am 11 years
 old. I have a younger brother. I live 
 in a detached house near my school. I 
 wake up about 7.30 a.m. and get washed
 and dressed in my school uniform. I go
 downstairs and eat cornflakes for     
 breakfast. I usually watch'Good       
 Morning Britain'on the T.V. while I am
 eating. I walk to school, which starts
 at 9.00. First, my teacher calls the  
 register and then we go to the hall   
 for assembly with all the school.     
 After that we usually do maths until  
 playtime when we go into the play-    
 ground. I like skipping or talking    
 with my friends and the boys always   
 play football.After play we do English
 or watch a program called'Good Health'
 on the T.V. and do follow up work on  
 it until dinnertime. I then eat my    
 sandwiches, which I bring from home   
 and have a long playtime afterwards.  </content>
