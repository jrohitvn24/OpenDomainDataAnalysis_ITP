		<title>11Transport _ Newton area</title>
		<content>  Most villagers in this area have     
 their own vehicles as there is        
 virtually no public transport. The    
 nearest main line railway station is  
 12 miles away at Newark. A private    
 hire coach calls weekly at North      
 Clifton to transport passengers to and
 from Newark market.A similar firm     
 operates from Newton and Dunham.A     
 supermarket also operates a free bus  
 service to their store. Roads in the  
 area are chiefly 'B' class but the A57
 which runs from Lincoln across the    
 Pennines to Lancashire traverses the  
 area. The River Trent is spanned by a 
 privately owned Toll Bridge.  Tolls   
 range from 10 pence to 40 pence       
 depending on the size of the vehicle. 
 About 2  million vehicles a year use  
 the bridge. Pedestrians pass free.
