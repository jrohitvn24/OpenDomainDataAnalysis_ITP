    At the end of{Woolden Road}(which  
 is on Cadishead Moss) there is a house
 in which, it is rumoured,{Oliver}     
{Cromwell}lived. It is called{Great}   
{Woolden Hall,}and is very big. The    
 present owner said, "People say he    
 lived here but there isn't any proof."
 The house is over{five hundred years} 
{old. Woolden Hall}used to be one big  
 house but now it is three separate    
 buildings. A part of the house which  
 is now the barn was rebuilt in{1865}  
 because it was falling down. The age  
 of the building means that it has     
 still got cobbles on the floor        
 outside. The three separate buildings 
 are{1. The house itself,}where the    
 presnt owners live.{2. The cowshed,   
 where they milk and feed the cows.{3.}
{The old barn}where they keep the      
 machinery and stack all the hay.      </content>
