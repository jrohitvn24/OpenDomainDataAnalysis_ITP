		<title>15HOVERCRAFT</title>
		<content> The SRN4 Mk1 started service with     
 Hoverlloyd in1969 from Ramsgate to    
 Calais.The SRN4 Mk1 was built by      
 British Hovercraft Corporation and had
 the capability of carrying 30 cars and
 254 passengers.Whilst in service with 
 Hoverlloyd and Seaspeed,improvements  
 to capacity and reliability followed  
 to produce Mk2 and Mk3 versions.      
                                       
 Hoverspeed was formed in October 1981,
 through a merger of Hoverlloyd ans    
 Seaspeed, as a progression in         
 operating commercial hovercraft over  
 cross-channel routes.                 
 The hovercraft is now firmly          
 established as an alternative to      
 traditional ships, with superior      
 speed,comfort and flexibility.
