		<title>04ALL SAINTS CHURCH/INTERIOR</title>
		<content> All Saints Church has three unique    
 features.The first  is the freize of  
 small,bright memorial tiles extending 
 all round the interior of the         
 church.These tiles started in 1872 to 
 commemorate men lost at sea.The second
 is the great marble memorial erected  
 in 1779 in memory of Nicholas Magen.  
 This is said to be the finest example 
 of Italian marble in England.The third
 is found in the Beriffe Chapel:the    
 famous fifteenth century Beriffe      
 brasses.                              
 Other parts of particular interest are
 the 200 tapestry kneelers,each worked 
 with a design reflecting the history  
 of the community,some fine stained    
 glass and the church chest made from a
 tree trunk.This dates back to 1740 and
 has three seperate locks so that it   
 could only be opened by the vicar and 
 two church wardens acting together.   </content>
