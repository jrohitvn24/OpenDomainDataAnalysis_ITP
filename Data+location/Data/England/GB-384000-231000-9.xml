		<title>09THE LANDSCAPE OF FORTHAMPTON</title>
		<content> A large part of the block is owned by 
 the Yorke Estates who altogether own  
 3000 acres of land. They actually farm
 800 acres and let the rest to tenant  
 farmers. Mnay of these families have  
 farmed the land for several           
 generations and hoped a few years ago 
 to be able to buy their land but the  
 Estate decided against selling.       
 Most of the area is given over to     
 mixed farming, especially cereals,    
 beef cattle and sheep.  Two local     
 farmers also maintain dairy herds.    
 There is a slight bias towards pasture
 land. There used to be many orchards  
 here but no fruit is now grown in the 
 area. There is still a lot of         
 scattered woodland and, although      
 farming is no longer a major employer,
 the landscape reflects a picture      
 little changed for centuries.
