		<content>   Although the{Keighley}area has a lot
 of terraced houses nearly all have the
 complete range of amenities people    
 have come to expect.A house without a 
 bathroom would now be rare.In addition
 fitted kitchens are now much more     
 common.                               
   In a typical {Keighley}terraced     
 house the following amenities would be
 found:3 bedrooms,a bathroom with      
 possibly a shower,a living room,a     
 seperate dining room and kitchen or   
 a dining kitchen with fitted kitchen  
 units.Some houses would have central  
 heating whilst others would rely on   
 coal or gas fires.Double glazing has  
 become more popular as windows are    
 replaced.                             
   Electrical equipment would include; 
 automatic washing machine, fridge-
