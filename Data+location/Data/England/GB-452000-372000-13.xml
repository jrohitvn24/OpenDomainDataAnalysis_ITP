		<title>13GAMES CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content> In the playground we play games like  
 Chasing, Hide and Seek and Tiggy. At  
 Tiggy somebody has to be on and then  
 chases the other people until he      
 touches someone else. Then they are on
 and the game carries on like this.    
 We also play Farmer, Farmer Can I     
 Cross Your Golden Water? Somebody is  
 the Farmer and he lets the other      
 people cross the yard using fairy     
 steps or giant strides.               
 In the summer we can go on the school 
 field and play ball games. The girls  
 play rounders and tennis, and the boys
 play cricket and football. If there   
 are only a few boys we play Three and 
 In. We use our coats for goal posts   
 and just have one goal. The person who
 scores three goals first has to go in 
 goal next. If there are more boys we  
 pick two sides and have a proper game 
 of football.                          </content>
