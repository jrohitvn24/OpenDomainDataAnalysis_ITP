		<title>15THE ABATTOIR -WENT HILLS</title>
		<content>     The abattoir at Home Farm,        
 Stapleton, is privately owned. It is  
 not a part of the Stapleton Estate.   
     Most of the animals that are taken
 there come from the local farms, and  
 cattle markets, but some animals are  
 brought quite long distances.         
     On the day that we went there,    
 some sheep had been brought over from 
 Wales.                                
     The butchers who used the abattoir
 appeared to be from the nearby towns, 
 such as Pontefract and Castleford.    
     The cattle trucks had come from   
 places in both North and West         
 Yorkshire.                            
     The road system is probably the   
 main reason for the abattoir's        
 success.
