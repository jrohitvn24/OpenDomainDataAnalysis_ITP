		<content> Everybody in the block now has        
 electricity although not many use     
 electricity for anything other than   
 lighting.                             
 Most people have Agas or Rayburns on  
 which they cook and which provide hot 
 water. Some people area able to run   
 Central Heating from their stoves.    
 Many people burn logs which are       
 collected or purchased locally or they
 purchase coal from a travelling coal  
 merchant.                             
 There is no piped gas at all in the   
 area as we are a long way from the    
 main pipelines. At one time there was 
 a windmill as we have a lane called   
 Mill Lane.                            
 Our nearest petrol station is 3 miles 
 away.
