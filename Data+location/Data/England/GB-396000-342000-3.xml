   In 1952 Government reorganisation   
resulted in the school becoming part of
an"AIDED" school under the umbrella    
of the Church of England. This is      
true of many school in this area of    
North Staffordshire.                   
  The Trust know pays annually into    
the Barchester Scheme.This scheme      
provides for the repair of the exteria 
of the school. The L.E.A. being        
reponsible for the staffing and        
repairs to the interia of the school.  
  There was much discussion over this  
change for although originally a       
church based foundation, the village   
over the years was influenced greatly  
by the Methodist tradition.Today       
both aid and encourage the school in   
its work. The numbers of children,aged 
4 to 11 years have fallen to 34,but    
the school provides a varied eduaction.</content>
