		<title>09The Quantock Wardens  Office</title>
		<content>   The {Warden}travels by land rover   
 down to his office in{Kilve Court}for 
 8.30 am .This happens each week day   
 morning. At least the first hour is   
 spent on office work, answering {phone
{qeries}and dealing with the{mail.}This
 could lead onto further activities    
 during the day. For example, today a  
 query by letter concerning a {public  
{footpath}resulted in a phone call to  
 the{person making a protest}over a    
 path beingblocked by a locked gate.   
 This was followed up by the {warden   
{walking the path}to discover a broken 
 gate tied up. This necessitated a     
 further phone{call pointing out the   
{trouble to the  owner of the}gate.    
     Similarly information of the      
{marines}on{night exercises}results in 
 much communication by phone and letter
 to Parish Councils,and other          
 interested parties.                   </content>
