		<content> East Grinstead is a Sussex market town
 near the border of Kent and Surrey.   
 The main part of the town was built on
 high land across the main London to   
 Lewes Road,now the A22.Along the      
 London Road there are shops,behind    
 which there are houses and flats of   
 all ages and sizes,both private and   
 council properties.                   
 Industry is restricted to two main    
 sites,one on Birches Industrial estate
 and the other on Durkins Farm.By far  
 the largest proportion of the area is 
 farmland and woodland.The area has    
 been associated with the              
 Sackville,Dorset and De La Warr       
 families and this is reflected in the 
 names of many of the buildings and    
 roads.
