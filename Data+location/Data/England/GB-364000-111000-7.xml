		<title>07MEANS OF TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> The inhabitants of this block have a  
 bus service which runs through        
 Longburton from Sherborne to          
 Dorchester four times daily except on 
 Sundays.  However most people find    
 that their own transport is essential 
 in a rural area of this type and      
 therefore most families own at least  
 one car and a number own two to enable
 the wife to travel to neighbouring    
 larger towns for shopping, playschools
 and general recreation facilities.    
 The high cost of running a car results
 in some people owning motorcycles and 
 mopeds - especially young people some 
 of whom use this means of transport to
 get to and from their schools when old
 enough.  Most school children get to  
 school by coach service (privately    
 owned) - the majority of the children 
 in this block go to school in         
 Sherborne approx. 3 miles away.       </content>
