   Our area consists of a 12 kilometre 
 block of rural Gloucestershire in the 
 Severn Vale between Lower Apperley in 
 the north and a small village called  
 The Leigh in the south east. Much of  
 the area is low lying below the 10    
 metre contour and is regularly flooded
 by the River Severn each winter.Lower 
 Apperley lies on a spur of higher     
 ground rising to 50 metres while The  
 Leigh is situated on a knoll just over
 15 metres high.                       
   The River Severn can only be crossed
 at one place between Gloucester and   
 Tewkesbury at the Haw Bridge on the   
 B4213 road.The A38 main road passes   
 near The Leigh in the south east.
