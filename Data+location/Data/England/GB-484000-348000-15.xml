		<content>       My name is Jamie Lambert and I  
 live in Osterfen Lane, Claypole. I go 
 to Claypole Primary School. I am nine 
 years old and in my third year.       
   I enjoy history and at the moment we
 are practising "Scrooge" for our play 
 at Christmas. We are going to decorate
 the classroom in the Victorian style. 
        I also enjoy cookery and made  
 some American "cookies" as part of a  
 topic on America. In clay I have made 
 a fish and also a coil pot which I am 
 giving Grandma for Christmas.         
       My best friend,Paul Summerfield,
 lives at Dry Doddington. I sometimes  
 go and stay at his farm for the day   
 and he stays at my house. I enjoy     
 playing in the straw stacks and       
 feeding the pigs.                     
       My favourite times are firework 
 night, Christmas and the New Year.
