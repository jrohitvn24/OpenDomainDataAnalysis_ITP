		<title>14INTERVIEW WITH MR.ALLISON</title>
		<content>   THE VILLAGE WAS A THRIVING COMMUNITY
 WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED INTO A BACK-   
 WATER.THIS IS MAINLY DUE TO THE BYPASS
 BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE CLOSURE OF THE
 QUARRY AT HELBECK AND THE CLOSURE OF  
 THE RAILWAY.THE ONLY LARGE EMPLOYER IS
 THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE AT WARCOP.    
   BROUGH IS QUIETER FOR RESIDENTS     
 SINCE THE BYPASS WAS BUILT.IT ALWAYS  
 DEPENDED ON THE ROAD SINCE THE DAYS   
 WHEN IT WAS A STOPPING PLACE FOR STAGE
 COACHES.WITHOUT THE ROAD THE TOWN IS  
 DOOMED WITHOUT ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT.
   THERE WAS A CINEMA AT KIRKBY STEPHEN
 THERE WERE WEEKLY DANCES AT THE       
 MEMORIAL HALL,NOW ONLY USED FOR THE   
 YOUTH CLUB.THERE STILL ARE BILLIARDS  
 AND SNOOKER.THERE WERE TENNIS COURTS  
 WHERE THE FOOTBALL PITCH IS AND THE   
 SWIMMING POOL WAS FILLED IN WHEN THE  
 BYPASS WAS BUILT.
