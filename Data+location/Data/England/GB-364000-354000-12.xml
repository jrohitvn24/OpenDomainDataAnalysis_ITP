		<title>12Hall Farm.</title>
		<content> Hall Farm is part of {The Cheshire    
{College of Agriculture}.Students from 
 all over the world come to the college
 to learn how to become farmers. Most  
 of the students become dairy farmers. 
 At Hall Farm there are 150 black and  
 white{Friesian}cows. These cows are   
 milked twice daily. They are cleaned  
 before being milked so that they don't
 infect the milk. Each cow gives about 
 20 to 25 litres of milk a day.They are
 milked by machines, although they     
 could be milked by hand if the        
 machines ever broke down.             
 The milk goes from the milking        
 machines to big,stainless steel tanks 
 where it is kept cool  so that the    
 bacteria in it can not grow. Tankers  
 collect the milk and take it to       
 factories and to bottling plants.     
 Most of the milk is used to make the  
 famous{Cheshire Cheese}.              </content>
