		<content>  Mr. Dengate owns Acton Farm and has  
 240 acres.  The buildings on his farm 
 are mainly modern the oldest having   
 been built in 1944.  There is a cold  
 store, which was specially made and is
 airtight, where he stores his apples  
 so they keep longer.  He grows 60     
 acres of apples. When the apples are  
 ripe they are sorted into sizes on an 
 apple grader. The apples are put onto 
 a conveyor belt and then they fall    
 into the holes for their size.  Mr.   
 Dengate grows a few potatoes and has  
 120 acres of cereal crops. There are a
 few Dorset Down sheep which go into   
 the sheep dip twice a year.           
  In the 35 acres of woodland on the   
 farm there is a den of foxes with 5   
 cubs, and 2 badger sets with 6 badgers
 in one and cubs in the other.  There  
 is a trout pond and by it there is a  
 heron scarer.                         </content>
