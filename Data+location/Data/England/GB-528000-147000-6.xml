		<content>{    The South Nutfield Free Church }is
 the oldest church in Nutfield it is{  
{100 }years old in{1986.}The Church was
 formed when two boys went to the coast
 but they drowned and a man saw that   
 there was no Sunday School to teach   
 young children what is dangerous and  
 what is not.                          
     The{first church}was an old barn  
 but now it is a brick building.       
     The reason why it is called the   
{Free Church}is because there is no    
 governing body. There is{no}full time 
 Vicar. The money comes from the       
 congregation and there are about{40}  
 people in the congregation. Another   
 difference is that it is open worship.
 Sometimes  there is a joint worship   
 with{Christ Church.
