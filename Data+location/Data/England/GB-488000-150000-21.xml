<title>21The Demise Of Public Houses In Ash</title>
<content>

Of the twelve public houses mentioned in the original article only five remain. This is mainly due (I believe) to cheap alcohol being available from local supermarkets and the smoking ban introduced some years ago. The Greyhound is still there, though no longer privately owned. The Swan is very busy most weekends, serving good food and drink at reasonable prices. The Admiral Napier is the closest to a pub as was but is now somewhat run down. The Standard Of England closed down and re-opened some months later but is not very well visited. Of the rest, the Cricketers is now local housing, as is the King's Head, Chester Arms and The Cannon. The Dover Arms is used by the adjacent Dover garage for storage of cars. The Bricklayers Arms has been closed for some years and is earmarked for development. I can remember a visit to all the pubs around Ash being a good pub crawl - not any more.   &lt;br />
