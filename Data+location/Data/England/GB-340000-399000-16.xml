		<title>16VANDALISM</title>
		<content> One of the least attractive features  
 of Kirkby is vandalism. Many of the   
 shops outside of the town centre have 
 their windows completely boarded up   
 because they have been smashed so many
 times. Many bus shelters have been    
 smashed and sometimes bus drivers     
 refuse to drive through parts of      
 Kirkby because stones have been       
 thrown at their buses. Graffiti       
 defaces houses and buildings in all   
 areas of the town.                    
 This is very rarely obscene, but      
 usually consists of nicknames and     
 names of football teams and pop       
 groups. Finally, many people do not   
 use litterbins or council tips, so the
 grass verges are full of litter and in
 some cases old chairs and beds.
