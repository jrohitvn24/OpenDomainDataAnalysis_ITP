		<content> The land is mainly uncultivated,      
 comprising both woodland and non      
 woodland vegetation, heather and rocky
 areas. The main occupations are       
 forestry and sheep farming. The       
 woodland is mostly cultivated         
 conifers, generally owned by the      
 Fitzwillkiam family estates. To the   
 south are the Dale Dyke and Strines   
 reservoirs belonging to the Yorkshire 
 Water Board. Thre are a few scattered 
 farms, one public house (The Strines  
 Inn) and an old manor (Hallfield      
 House). This dairly remote area, part 
 of the Peak District National Park,   
 although having no bus service is     
 frequented by hikers and weekend      
 motorists. Private moorland to the    
 north of the Strines is criss crossed 
 with paths leading to Grouse moors and
 shooting butts.
