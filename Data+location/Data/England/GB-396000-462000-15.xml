		<title>15A THRESHFIELD CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content>   My name is Amy Harrison and this is 
 a typical day in my life.             
   I get up at 8am. for school.I wear  
 a uniform that varies from Winter to  
 Summer.The television is always on in 
 the mornings.It takes 7 minutes to get
 to school,which starts at 9.OOam.     
 Shortly after arriving at school one  
 of the teachers will come out and we  
 go into school to begin work.We have  
 three breaks during the day.As the day
 goes on we may work on Maths, English,
 Science,Art and possibly the Computer.
 At home in the evening I usually lay  
 the fire and light it.Then, I usually 
 go out to play.I have my evening meal 
 at 5.OOpm with Mum,Dad and Daniel, my 
 brother.The television is once again  
 on in the evenings. I watch it until  
 the news comes on and then I do my    
 piano practice.Finally  I may go out  
 again before going to bed at 9.OOpm.. </content>
