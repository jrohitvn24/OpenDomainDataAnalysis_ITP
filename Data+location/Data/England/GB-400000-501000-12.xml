 kilometers is 96.The youngest is just 
 a few months old and the oldest is    
 86 years.                             
                                       
  Of these 2 are  under school age     
           17 attend school

 Exactly half of the present           
 population were born and grew up in   
 Arkengarthdale.                       
                                       
 Most of the people live in the        
 villages of Langthwaite and Arkle     
 Town.Only ten of the population live  
 alone and most of those are senior    
 citizens.
