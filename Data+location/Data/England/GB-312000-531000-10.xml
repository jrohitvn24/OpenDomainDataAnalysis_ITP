		<title>10TRANSPORT 2 (A595)</title>
		<content> The A595 has been in existence since  
 at least 1700. In the early days this 
 road was travelled by the mail coach, 
 farmers and private carriages.        
 Carrying charges on goods, from       
 Carlisle to Cockermouth, were 2 1/4d  
 per stone and 3/4d per pack weighing  
 over 7lbs. These rates were fixed by  
 the town council.                     
   In 1824 the A595 was turnpiked with 
 an average cost of 2d per vehicle,    
 this charge was removed in 1883.      
   The removal of the turnpikes meant  
 that the road had to be maintained by 
 the parishioners of Cockermouth.      
   In the late 1800's the road was made
 into a main road and the upkeep of it 
 fell on the county.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
