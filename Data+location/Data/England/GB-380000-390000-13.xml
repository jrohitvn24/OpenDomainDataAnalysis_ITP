 The date was the 5th July 1985. Now it
 was the children's turn to celebrate  
 Father McDonald's Silver Jubilee.     
 We were admiring each other's         
 clothing, feeling glad we could wear  
 our best clothes, not our school      
 uniform. The Mass had been prepared by
 the children, and every class         
 participated. At the end, the Head    
 Girl, Rosemary Howarth and the Head   
 Boy, Damian Jack, on behalf of the    
 children, presented Father McDonald   
 with a spritual bouquet and a piece of
 Tyrone crystal. The crystal had a     
 picture of Jesus and some children    
 etched onto it. The money for the     
 presents has been raised in various   
 ways. Two cake sales, a toy fair and a
 junior disco between them raised the  
 Â£250 needed.                          
                                       </content>
