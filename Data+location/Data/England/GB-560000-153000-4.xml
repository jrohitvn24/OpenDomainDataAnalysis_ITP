		<title>04The hamlet of BASTED</title>
		<content> Basted is a hamlet of less than 30    
 houses and a public house called The  
 Plough. It is situated beside the     
 River Bourne, 1.5 km south of Borough 
 Green.                                
                                       
 The hamlet is dominated by the large  
{publishing}works, Butterworths which  
 occupies a riverside site nearby.  It 
 provides{employment}for many local    
 people.  It used to be a paper mill,  
 using the excellent water of the river
 in the production of high quality     
 paper. Until fairly recently, printing
 was also carried on here but this is  
 no longer the case.
