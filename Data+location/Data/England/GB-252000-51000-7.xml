		<title>07Elburton  Vineries</title>
		<content> Elburton Vineries are a very          
 important part of Elburton Village    
 because of the 'Elburton' tomatoes    
 grown there. There are 4.5 acres under
 glass and they have been there since  
 1930. Before the vineries were there  
 it was farmland. The Vineries are     
 company owned and the present manager,
 Mr.Randell, has been there since about
 1951. He uses chemical fertilizer for 
 growing his products which include    
 cucumbers as well as tomatoes. The    
 greenhouses are thermostatically      
 controlled  at about 70 degrees       
 Fahrenheit. Instead of chemical       
 pesticides he uses predator insects.  
 He has about 12 fulltime &amp; 6 part-time
 employees. The produce is sold to     
 wholesalers only.
