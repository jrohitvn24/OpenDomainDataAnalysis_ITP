		<content>  Because he is part of our{community  
 he knows his beat,he is aware of      
 change.A typical day includes visiting
 a school to give a talk on cycling

 crime,checking a house when an elderly
 lady has not been seen for several    
 days,talking to the parents of a child
 who seemed to be at risk and making   
 inquiries to other{police forces      
 outside the county of Essex.

 enables him not only to{investigate   
 crime,but to{prevent crime}and to care
 for the community as a whole.
