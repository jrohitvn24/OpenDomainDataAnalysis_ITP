		<title>04LOCAL POLICE WORK</title>
		<content>   There are two local policemen in    
 the area.One of them was              
 interviewed by our class.This is what 
 we found out:-Most crimes here are    
{traffic offences,housebreaking, }     
 and{vandalism.}It was felt that more  
 policing was needed, not to solve     
 crime , but to provide police to give 
 a service to the community.           
    {Computers}have streamlined much of
 the work and made police investigation
 more efficient by the storing of data 
 for immediate retrieval and reference.
   The major changes noticed in society
 generally  over the last 20 years,    
 are the deterioration of the general  
 behaviour of{teenagers,}and the       
 increase in the amount of{vandalism. }
  Policing our area  combines very     
 quiet spells with spells of intense   
 activity coinciding with local events.
