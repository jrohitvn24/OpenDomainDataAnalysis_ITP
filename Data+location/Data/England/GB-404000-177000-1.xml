		<title>01Farmland Around Bushton</title>
		<content> The area is almost entirely           
 agricultural, the land being laid out 
 mainly for grassland; as a consequence
 it is an area carrying dairy cows, but
 few sheep.   Most farms have a herd of
 milking cows as well as those being   
 prepared for slaughter as meat.   Milk
 production is high.   people live in  
 scattered areas; not all are features;
 those not working on farms, commute   
 daily to the larger towns, mainly     
 Swindon.   From enquiries it would    
 seem that life is enjoyable though    
 quiet.
