		<content> Mr.Tom Moody is a Deputy at Welbeck   
 Colliery.He began work there as a 14  
 year_old school leaver.Although he had
 passed entrance examinations for a    
 grammar school place , home           
 circumstances forced him to begin     
 work.                                 
 When he began in 1943 the pits were   
 run by private companies and the      
 majority of the work was done by man- 
 power.Few safety precautions were     
 taken and Mr.Moody says that of the   
 900,000 men employed at the time over 
 1500 were killed every year.          
 Before nationalisation the colliery   
 was owned by the New Hucknall and     
 Blackwell Co.By 1947 the pits had been
 nationalized ,Mr. Moody began working 
 a 5 day week,and was paid 6 shifts for
 5.The shortage of fuel however led to 
 Saturday and Sunday overtime working.
