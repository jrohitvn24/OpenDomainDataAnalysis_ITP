		<title>17Healthy Steyning</title>
		<content> The general health of people is very  
 good now.A long time ago in Steyning  
 lots of people died from{smallpox,    
{measles}and{colds.}Steyning is a very 
 clean area now and there are laws     
 which make sure that food is kept free
 from{germs.}So that is one reason why 
 people are{healthier.}There is a      
{Health Centre}in Steyning which looks 
 after people who are ill and to help  
 stop us getting ill.                  
 In the past people didn't care where  
 they put their{waste}.Now they put it 
 in a{dustbin}and it is collected every
 week and taken away to be{burned}or   
{buried}deep in the ground.            
{Water}is also much{cleaner}than it    
 used to be because{dirty}water goes to
 a special place to be{cleaned. Dirty  
 water is not allowed to be pumped into
 rivers and the sea, although some     
 people still do.                      </content>
