 Tractors, who were taken over by{Case 
 in 1980.{Case Tractors}make a range   
 of different tractors small and large 
 to suit all needs.The colours are red,
 white, and black.They are easy to     
 operate, efficient, simple and        
 reliable and most have electronic     
 controls.70% of the tractors are sent 
 to U.S.A., Finland, Australia, New    
 Zealand, Portugal, Greece, Sweden,    
 Denmark, France and the rest of       
 Europe. The other 30% are sold in     
 Great Britain.{Case Tractors}are now  
 one of the largest producers of       
 construction equipment in the world.  
 Recently a drop in world demand for   
 tractors has led to many employees    
 losing their jobs.
