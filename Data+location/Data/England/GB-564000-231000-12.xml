		<title>12SPAINS HALL ARCHITECTURE.</title>
		<content> Architecturally Spains Hall is        
 Elizabethan in style.It is built of   
 red brick with clustered chimneys,    
 curvilinear gables,mullioned and      
 transomed windows and is irregular in 
 plan.It is typical of the great Essex 
 manor houses in the older tradition   
 with central hall,porch and           
 cross-wings.Since it was built in the 
 late sixteenth century it was altered 
 in 1637 and partially rebuilt in 1768,
 but it retains its Tudor character.   
 Internally there is an elegant dining 
 room,hall,panelled library and a      
 charming drawing room.The Tapestry    
 Room is of special interest as are the
 domestic quarters which include a gun 
 room,boot and lamp rooms and kitchen. 
 The grounds have pleasant gardens and 
 a Prayer House,rebuilt in 1839 at the 
 end of the Elizabethan wall.
