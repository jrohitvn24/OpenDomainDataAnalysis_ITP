		<content>    Punks are a group of people who    
 stand out from the rest of the        
 crowd.Their clothes are usually dark  
 leather or baggy.The girls wear       
 short,black,leather skirts,with dog   
 chains or spiked belts.They wear      
 fish-net tights,with black pointed    
 boots.The boys have very tight        
 trousers,leather.They have spiked     
 bracelets,and baggy tops.For shoes    
 they have Doctor Martin's boots,which 
 are a very good quality shoe.Their    
 hair is what makes them stand out:they
 have different colour hair,and very   
 unusual styles.                       
    Many people look down on punks     
 because of their appearance.They are  
 often turned down for jobs,and are    
 blamed for vandalism.People think they
 are violent trouble makers,but the    
 majority are very pleasant. By J.Hill
