When the tunnel was being built the men
used a large,round cylinder made from  
metal,this was to protect them.As they 
went deeper under the ground they came 
to rocks of millstone grit.They drilled
holes in these and then put in         
explosives and blew them up,this is    
called blasting.                       
      While this was going on at the   
Quernmore end workmen were doing the   
same thing at Abbeystead and they met  
in the middle.The whole scheme cost    
60 million pounds and took three years 
to complete.                           
      It was offically opened by the   
Queen in 1980 and all the local        
children were invited to go and watch. 
We went to Quernmore Park and had a    
very good view, it was an exciting day.
