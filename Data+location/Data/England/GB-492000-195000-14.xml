		<title>14ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY CENTRE</title>
		<content> Mrs Hopkins runs the environmental    
 centre.Her salary is paid by Bucks    
 County Council because she is a       
 teacher but the electricity board pay 
 for everything else.She once had two  
 classrooms,but in 1981 one classroom  
 burnt down overnight due to an        
 electrical fault,with all her         
 microscopes,specimens etc.Every day   
 school children from Bucks, and,      
 sometimes adults,visit _ about 5000   
 people a year!Flora and fauna are very
 varied as there are two different soil
 types.On the top it is clay,and in the
 dip it is almost down to chalk        
 bedrock.In 1972 two species of grass  
 and clover were sown,and this year Mrs
 Hopkins has counted 128 different     
 species,and 190 orchids.There is a    
 nature trail with 13 view-points,and  
 we were each given a book about it.
