		<content>     There are a large number of Hotels
 in Woolacombe, varying from small     
 guest houses to large 3 Star hotels.  
 The smaller guest houses generally    
 open only during the summer season,   
 but a trend in recent years has been  
 for the larger hotels to extend their 
 season and even remain open virtually 
 all year.                             
     The Woolacombe Bay Hotel has      
 developed its facilities to cater not 
 only for holiday makers but also for  
 locals, with squash courts, swimming  
 pools, tennis courts, sauna and       
 solarium and a pitch-and-put course.  
     The Narracott Hotel is a large,   
 modern hotel in the centre of the     
 village, complete with badminton and  
 squash courts and indoor pool.        
     The Coombs Hotel, The Beach, The  
 Watersmeet and The Watersfall are the 
 other main hotels in Woolacombe.      </content>
