		<content> To get a picture of the occupational  
 and social class make up of our block 
 200 people were asked their job. The  
 results were classified thus:-        
 Professional/Managerial 4.9%; Clerical
 Supervisory l2%; Skilled 8.2%; Semi   
 skilled l0.9%; Unskilled l7.5%; Part  
 time 3.2%; Housewives 4.3%; Retired   
 4.9%; Not working l8.l%.              
  The replies revealed some social     
 class differences between communities 
 in our block. While all those in      
 managerial jobs lived in Whickham, 70%
 of semi skilled and 62.5% of unskilled
 workers lived in Lobley Hill. The     
 proportion of those not working is the
 same for each area, but almost all the
 women who referred to themselves as   
 housewives lived in Whickham.         
  Only one person described themself as
 unemployed. Where did they live?      
 Whickham of course!                   </content>
