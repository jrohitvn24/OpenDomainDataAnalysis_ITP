		<title>12Horse Riding in Sussex</title>
		<content> Many people in the country own their  
 own ponies.There is plenty of open    
 country to ride in as well as special 
 events organised by the Pony Club.    
   Some owners are willing to share    
 their pony with less fortunate people.
 The disabled have an arrangement which
 enables them to borrow a pony for a   
 few hours each week,so that physically
 or mentally handicapped children may  
 experience the pleasure of riding.The 
 ponies have to be very good tempered  
 of course.There are many owners ready 
 to lend their ponies and take great   
 pleasure and pride in giving such a   
 valuable service.
