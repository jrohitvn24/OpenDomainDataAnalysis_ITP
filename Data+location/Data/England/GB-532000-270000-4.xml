		<title>04Mrs D.A Housewife &amp; Mother.</title>
		<content> Mrs D. has 3 children aged 8-13yrs,and
 lives in Needingworth.She has lived   
 there most of her life but originated 
 from St Ives.She used to work in a    
 bank but left when she had her        
 children. She likes living in the     
 village because it's not too builtup, 
 and she likes her bungalow.She has 4  
 brothers.                             
 She feels there aren't enough         
 facilities in the area but there are  
 in St Ives.She considers that the     
 biggest change is the new housing     
 estates.But this hasn't affected her  
 personally.She likes the present times
 because people have more freedom and  
 choice.She doesn't like the present   
 unemployment which is causing boredom 
 and could lead to a violent society.  
 Also there's too much misuse of drugs.
 People seem to want too much in       
 exchanged for too little effort.      </content>
