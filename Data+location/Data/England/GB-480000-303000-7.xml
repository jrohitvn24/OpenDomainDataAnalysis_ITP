		<title>07Land Use in Leighfield</title>
		<content> The land in Leighfield is intensively 
 farmed. The main type of farming is   
 arable with crops including oilseed   
 rape, wheat and barley. The fields are
 large and full use is made of the most
 modern machinery.                     
 There are a few small areas where     
 livestock are reared e.g. dairy cows  
 at Withcote Lodge (808048) and sheep  
 at Leigh Lodge (829040).There is also 
 a small farm rearing pigs, chickens   
 and sheep (832059) and a small horse  
 stud farm (836057) on which are also  
 kept a few cattle and sheep.
