		<content>  The results of our land use survey   
  showed that the block falls into two 
 distinct areas _ the northern part of 
{YEOVIL}and the surrounding            
 countryside,dotted with small         
 villages.                             
   As a result,land cover is almost    
 equally divided between Farmland and  
 Housing.Most of the Farmland is       
 grass,mainly for cattle grazing,with  
 some arable crops and a big Fruit     
 Farm.The small villages are           
 attractive,with many Hamstone         
 cottages,old Churches and Inns with   
 more modern houses and bungalows on   
 the outskirts.Few of the villages have
 a shop,few of the inhabitants are     
 young and many of the primary schools 
 have closed.Most adults drive to      
 Yeovil for work and entertainment.
