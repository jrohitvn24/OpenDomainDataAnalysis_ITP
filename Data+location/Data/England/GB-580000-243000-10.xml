		<title>10My first school</title>
		<content>   Our school looks like a church. On  
 the porch there are{two foxes}carved, 
 but their noses have weathered and    
 they look like bats! Every year there 
 is a{swallow's nest}on the roof beam. 
 Near the ground is an OS benchmark -  
 162.52ft above sealevel.              
   I was in the 'little class' for     
 three years. I remember the{initial   
{teaching alphabet,}and one particular 
 outing when we went to sea on a paddle
 steamer, the Waverley. This term we   
 saw the Queen arriving at Colchester. 
   I'm{School Captain}this week and    
 have to ring the bell at schooltime.  
   We wear royal blue cardigans for our
 uniform. Yesterday my Mum took me     
 shopping because I'm going to boarding
 school at Hockerill next term. I'm    
 looking forward to it in a way but    
 after{six years}you feel sad about    
 leaving.                              </content>
