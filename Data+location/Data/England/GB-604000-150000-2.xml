		<title>02GODMERSHAM FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> The village consists of small         
 households with a high proportion of  
 retired people, some living completely
 alone. The working population is small
 and there are few families with       
 children.                             
 Modern appliances have reduced the    
 time spent on routine housecare but   
 the resulting leisure time is mainly  
 spent at home.                        
 Although most time is spent watching  
 television, families do take an active
 pride in decorating and furnishing    
 their homes and tending their         
 flourishing gardens. Many families    
 keep domestic pets. Women still knit, 
 sew, embroider with skill and still   
 cook traditional recipes, especially  
 for family celebrations such as       
 Christmas. The mobile library is well 
 used and most families read daily     
 newspapers                            </content>
