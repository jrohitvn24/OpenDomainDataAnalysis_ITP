 Chalk is the most common rock in the  
 area, you will find it almost         
 everywhere. Broughton Downs are       
 made out of chalk, it has some flint  
 in it as well, and where the chalk    
 has been eroded away the hard flints  
 are left behind mixed with clay. Chalk
 flint and clay (made into bricks) are 
 used in the buildings in Broughton.   
{THE WALLOP BROOK}                     
 The Wallop Brook is quite a clean     
 river, it not polluted. It runs for   
 about five miles until it joins the   
 Test at Kimbridge. The brook has quite
 a few fish in it, and people fish and 
 swim in the clear, deep pools. Because
 the stream runs over chalk its level  
 drops with the water table; last      
 summer and autumn (1984) it was dry   
 for several months.
