		<title>07BURTON CONSTABLE HALL</title>
		<content>{  "It is likely that the Constables   
{came over with the Conqueror"}begins  
 the guidebook. They bought the manor  
 in the early 12th century and lived   
 there from the{16th century}when the  
 original Hall was built. Its present  
 owner,{John Chichester-Constable, 46th
{Lord Paramount of the Seignory of     
{Holderness}lives in part of the Hall, 
 which was enlarged and remodelled in  
 the late 18th century. Its great rooms
 are filled with the furnishings of its
 period and with examples of William   
 Constable's skill in science, and the 
 music, art and theatre of a life-style
 now gone.                             
   The Hall is open to visitors during 
 the summer, and is increasingly the   
 venue for{balls, wedding receptions,  
{parties}and other}functions where a   
 gracious environment is welcome.
