		<title>02LANDSCAPE OF UPPER WEARDALE</title>
		<content> In its upper reaches the{River Wear}is
 fast flowing and narrow with pictur-  
 esque waterfalls at West Blackdene and
 Middle Blackdene. As it flows down the
 valley it is joined by the{Ireshope   
{Burn,}the{Cleugh Burn}and various     
{sikes}(narrow rivulets that drain the 
 hillsides). The valley floor is narrow
 and winding and the fields, enclosed  
 by{dry stone walls,}rise up on either 
 side to meet the moorland. Trees grow 
 fairly thickly by the river and burn  
 sides but, apart from two conifer     
 plantations, the upper slopes are bare
 of trees. There are no village greens,
 the villages having  grown up on      
 either side of the main road.  Houses 
 are mostly of stone, some still       
 retaining the old{stone slab roofs,   
 some roofed with slate or, more       
 recently, pre-fabricated tiles.
