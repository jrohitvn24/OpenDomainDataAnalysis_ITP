		<content> The underlying rock in this area is   
{Carboniferous Limestone,}in contrast  
 to the slates and volcanic rocks found
 further north.The stone can be seen in
 the buildings and in the dry-stone    
 walls There are the remains of lime   
 kilns close by, where the limestone   
 from{Whitbarrow Scar }was burnt to    
 make lime for use on the clay-loam    
 soils. The dry-stone walls form the   
 predominant field barrier and are     
 generally kept in good repair by the  
 farmers themselves.The climate is too 
 cold and wet for crop production but  
 is most suitable for grass.The average
 rainfall is about {70 inches.}The mean
 summer temperature {18 C.}This study  
 was undertaken by the 23 Junior       
 children aged between 7-12, the Staff 
 and parent 'volunteers' of Crosthwaite
 C.E. Primary School.June/July 1985.
