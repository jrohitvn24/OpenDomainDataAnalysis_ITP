		<content> There was once a giant on St.Agnes    
 Beacon called Bolster who could step  
 from the Beacon to Carn Brea.There was
 also a giant on Carn Brea.There was a 
 feud between the giant on Carn Brea   
 and Giant Bolster.They hurled rocks at
 each other. It is said that Bolster   
 was stronger than the Giant on Carn   
 Brea and threw all of his rocks onto  
 Carn Brea.Eventually Bolster died and 
 even today parts of his body and      
 possessions can be seen protruding    
 through the surface of the Carn.      
     It is said that the Giant on the  
 Carn gathered some rocks together and 
 formed clusters all over the Carn.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
