		<content>    Today the Frogmill Inn looks       
 extremely grand and is set in about 3 
 acres of land.The River Coln runs     
 through the grounds and it is possible
 to sit outside on the patio eating    
 your lunch and admiring the view over 
 the Cotswolds.The original building is
 incorporated with many new extensions.
 There are various bars including the  
 Waterwheel Bar with an old water wheel
 that turns.A dining room that can sit 
 100 people and a banqueting hall which
 can accommodate 200 people.The latest 
 addition is a heli-port to take guests
 to the races in Cheltenham.Five people
 are employed full-time and ten        
 part-time.There are various excellent 
 menus to choose from varying in prices
 from 7.50 to 15.00 per person and as
 a result the Frogmill is now one of   
 the most popular hotels in            
 Gloucestershire.                      </content>
