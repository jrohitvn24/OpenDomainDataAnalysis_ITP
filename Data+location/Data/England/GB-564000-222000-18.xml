		<content> We play so many games.We looked them  
 up in Opie's book"Children's Games in 
 Street and Playground"1969,where most 
 are described.                        
  Our favourites,Bulldog,Chainy and    
 Fireworks are Touch and Chase games.We
 play Off Ground Touch and Budge(a game
 of touch metal),Please Mother May I   
 and Red Letters.We take different     
 sizes and numbers of steps.           
  Red Rover is a game where one team   
 has to run through another team while 
 they are holding hands.               
  On the Run and 40-40 are hide and    
 seek games.                           
  Sticky Glue is fun.When touched we   
 stand with legs wide open until some- 
 one goes under them to free us.
