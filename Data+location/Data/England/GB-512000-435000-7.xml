		<title>07Farming, Swine/Coniston</title>
		<content> The villages of Coniston and Swine in 
 Holderness lie on the eastern edge of 
 the Hull valley. Until comparatively  
 recent times, large areas of the      
 valley were frequently inundated at   
 high tides. Over the centuries this   
 resulted in thick peaty deposits on   
 the alluvial valley floor ths creating
 rich and fertile agricultural land.   
 The main crops are cereal (wheat and  
 barley), beans and some root crops    
 such as potatoes and turnips. The only
 sizeable dairy herd to be found is on 
 the outskirts of Coniston. The        
 landscape is low lying with the large 
 open fields typical of the plain of   
 Holderness. Most of the land in this  
 area is crown property and the local  
 farms are actually leased from the    
 crown.
