		<title>11LEIGHTON FIRE SERVICE</title>
		<content>  The local Fire Service covers        
 Leighton Buzzard and surrounding      
 villages but will go further to help  
 other stations if needed.             
  The station is situated in Lake      
 Street and has two pumping appliances 
 and one land rover. There are eight   
 full time fireman and eleven          
 part-timers. A crew of five men to    
 each pumping appliance, and two go in 
 the rover. The firemen wear the       
 standard uniform but have a badge and 
 buttons with the Bedfordshire Crest.  
  The most common types of fire in the 
 area are grass or chimney fires. The  
 largest fire in 1985 was the fire at  
 All Saints Church in Leighton Buzzard.
 Ten appliances were in attendance and 
 it took four hours to get it under    
 control and fourteen hours to put it  
 out. The church spire was burnt out   
 and 50% of the inside was damaged.    </content>
