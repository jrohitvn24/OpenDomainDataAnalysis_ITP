		<title>07FARMING ON THE S.DOWNS</title>
		<content>                                       
    Farming on the S.Downs has changed 
 radically since the 1939-45 war.      
 Formerly the downs were used for      
 grazing sheep but the powerful new    
 machinery made after the war made     
 ploughing of the top of the downs     
 possible; the turf disappeared &amp; with 
 it the sheep.                         
    As a result of these changes almost
 all the downland turf was lost, so    
 that the land is now scattered with   
 flints &amp; broken chalk.                
    The disappearance of the sheep     
 allowed the rough grasses &amp; scrub to  
 spread, so that small flowers no      
 longer flourish; bushes &amp; trees now   
 cover much of the steep northern      
 slopes.  Many mature beech trees were 
 felled to make way for cereal crops &amp; 
 large areas on the southern slopes    
 were planted with conifers.           </content>
