		<content>   Most weekends there are varied      
amounts of entertainment including     
cabaret,dancing,comedians and country  
and western bands appearing.Some are   
the best in the country.You can also   
have parties arranged for you with two 
menu's Â£A'andÂ£B'.                      
   The Seagull Inn has good facilities 
including a children's room,Garden with
a slide and swing.It also serves hot   
foods and is open all through the year 
not only in the summer.                
   Since many of the small caravan     
sites provide no entertainment,these   
facilities are very much in demand at  
weekends and during holidays.
