		<title>12HALESFIELD INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content> INDUSTRY_Due to the overcrowding in   
 the west Midlands Telford New Town was
 built to acommodate some of the       
 population some fifteen years ago.At  
 this time it was also necessary to    
 build industrial estates to provide   
 employment for the new housing        
 estates.A high proportion of the      
 factories are in the engineering      
 field, other categories include       
 plastics,electrical/electronic        
 factories,building trade supplies and 
 constructions.                        
 EMPLOYMENT_Most of the employees on   
 Halesfield come from the housing      
 estates built locally.                
 TRANSPORT_The firms that moved over   
 from the Midlands had difficulty with 
 travel between established customers, 
 suppliers and in some cases parent    
 firms.Many of these problems have now 
 been solved with the M54 motorway link</content>
