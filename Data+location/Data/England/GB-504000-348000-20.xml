		<title>20CHANGES:LEASINGHAM (PART3)</title>
		<content>  A "local" said that he felt R.A.F.   
 Cranwell had been a good thing for    
 Leasingham,as there was little other  
 local employment in the 1950's apart  
 from a few farming jobs.He said that  
 the village had become rather         
 impersonal as it had grown:"Before,"  
 he said,"everyone knew everyone else."
  The general feeling of the villagers 
 was that the movement of population   
 didn't harm the community.            
                                       
                                       
   THIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE "DOMESDAY  
 PROJECT" WAS COMPILED BY CLASS 5  AT  
 LEASINGHAM (C.E.) CONTROLLED PRIMARY  
 SCHOOL, LEASINGHAM, SLEAFORD, LINCS., 
 WITH HELP FROM THEIR CLASS TEACHER AND
 MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.
