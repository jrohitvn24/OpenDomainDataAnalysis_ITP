 The life in Golden Cross is not very  
exciting. People are living in a quiet 
environment. They spend most of their  
time at home. Sometimes they will do   
some shopping, visiting their friends  
and gardening etc.                     
 There are some activities going on in 
Chiddingly, however. They are arranged 
by the Chiddingly Parish Council, for  
both the young and the old.            
 There are many activities for the     
scouts, e.g rockclimbing, canoeing,    
camping ,mountain walking, cycling     
and gliding etc. Ocassionally, the     
council will arrange some competitions 
for the scouts, e.g camping. At the    
beginning of each year, there will be  
an outing, e.g London Science Museum.  
  Concerns are sometimes held in the   
Village Hall .
