		<title>11A TEYNHAM HAULAGE COMPANY</title>
		<content> A &amp; R J Wood are a haulage company on 
 the A2 in Teynham. They have seventeen
 38-tonne Mercedes lorries which cost  
 up to Â£40000 each. The business was   
 started in 1949 by Alf and Roy Wood in
 Sittingbourne but moved to Teynham    
 about 14 years ago. The business grew 
 bigger as Sheerness docks expanded.   
 The brothers now own separate         
 companies. The firm employs a total of
 about 90 people. At Teynham there are 
 about 22 drivers, 8 or 9 loading men  
 and 23 office staff. The remainder are
 employed in other offices around the  
 country. The driver's wage is Â£2.41 an
 hour. They are not allowed to drive   
 more than 8 hours a day. They haul    
 imported fruit and vegetables from    
 Sheerness or Newhaven docks, for      
 example: oranges, lemons, apples,     
 pears and potatoes. 1100 tonnes can be
 stored at the depot.                  </content>
