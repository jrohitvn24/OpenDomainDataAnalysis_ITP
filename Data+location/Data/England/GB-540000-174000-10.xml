		<title>10A Day in the Life:-</title>
		<content>The weekend was here at last.It was 9. 
00 a.m.when I woke up because my mum   
called and said breakfast was on the   
table.That wasn't the normal time I    
get up or have my breakfast.The reason 
why mum got me up was because I was    
going to East Lane market with my      
cousin and her friends.East Lane'sells 
all of things.After I got washed and   
got ready my cousin Nicola came and    
knocked on my door to see if I was     
ready.We got two buses down to East    
Lane.A 161 up to Eltham then a 21a     
up to East Lane.We had a look around   
for a while,then we decided to get     
some things. Soon we all  started to   
get tired so we all went home by the   
same buses again.That was Saturday     
22nd of June 1985
