		<title>17MY MUM'S DAY,  DUNSCROFT</title>
		<content> My mum gets up at 8 o'clock every     
 morning and gets washed and dressed.  
 She has breakfast with us and when we 
 have gone to school she goes up to the
 shops with the dog for a few          
 provisions. When she comes home she   
 puts the food in the cupboard and     
 makes a drink. Afterwards she goes    
 around the house polishing and        
 'hoovering' up. Then she has dinner   
 and washes the pots. During the       
 afternoon she knits and watches       
 television. At about 5 o'clock she    
 makes tea. After tea she washes the   
 pots -again, and then goes to the     
 Bingo. She goes to bed at about  11   
 o'clock and goes straight to sleep.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
