           MY MOTHER                   
 On Mondays my mother goes to St       
 Vincents to teach for 2 hours in the  
 afternoon.  Sometimes she teaches in  
 different schools as a supply teacher.
  She cooks our dinners at the weekend 
 and on Sundays we have roast meat and 
 potatoes and some vegetables.         
 She looks after me when I am ill.  She
 takes me to Brownies and dancing      
 classes and takes me to school and    
 comes and fetches me.  Her name is    
 Elizabeth Holmes.  She hardly has time
 to rest.  She also washes all our     
 clothes.  I am an only child.  My     
 father is an architect and travels to 
 London daily.                         
 For leisure she belongs to the Women's
 Institute, she is a trained artist and
 is a needlewoman and a lacemaker.     </content>
