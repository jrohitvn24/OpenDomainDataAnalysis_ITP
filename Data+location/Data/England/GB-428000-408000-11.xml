		<content> Within our local area there are three{
{primary}schools located at Kexbrough, 
 Darton and Barugh Green.Pupils attend 
 the primary schools from the age of   
 four to eleven.Then they are          
 transferred to Darton High School     
 which is a{comprehensive.}This is one 
 of the largest schools in the Barnsley
 area with 1,276 pupils and an         
 additional 118 sixth form students but
 numbers will drop due to falling      
 roles. It is a split-site school with 
 years one and two in Darton village,  
 and the rest located at Kexbrough.At  
 the moment we have a lack of{nursery  
 school provision in the area and this 
 has lead to the setting up of a       
 privately run playgroup for 3 to 5    
 year olds in Darton.All the above     
 schools are used for adult education  
 evening courses run by the local      
 authority.                            </content>
