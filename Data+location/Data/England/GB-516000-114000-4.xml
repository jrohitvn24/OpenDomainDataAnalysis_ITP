		<content> naturally belong to the rest of the   
 area - over the river it is rather a  
 part of the neighbouring small town of
 Henfield although with no             
 communication these is no real or     
 spiritual connection.  The remainder  
 of the 12 sq. km. block centres on the
 tiny parish of Ashurst but so small is
 the village that even before the      
 boundary of the survey area has been  
 reached 2km. to the south one has long
 been in Steyning parish and under its 
 influence.  To the north the next     
 village lies 3 km. distant but        
 although larger than Ashurst by an    
 order of magnitude, its gravity,      
 acting over the same distance as      
 Steyning's, is not so great. (cont.)
