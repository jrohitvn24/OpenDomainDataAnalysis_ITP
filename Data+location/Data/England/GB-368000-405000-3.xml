		<title>03Local History Deane&amp;Daubhill</title>
		<content>{Deane}was a large parish containing   
 many townships. The present Parish    
 Church was built in 1452, although the
 earliest record of the chapelry dates 
 back to 1100. A stone cross in the    
 churchyard commemorates the martyrdom 
 of George Marsh, Vicar of Deane, who  
 was burned at the stake at Chester in 
 1555 for refusing to acknowledge      
 "Romish" doctrines.                   
{                                      
{Daubhill}- referred to in Bolton      
 dialect as "Dobble"  - derives from   
 the old English word{daub,}meaning    
 clay. This area of Bolton was an      
 important centre for brickmakers      
 during the 19th century, when many    
 houses were needed for the rapidly    
 expanding population of the Industrial
 Revolution. Prior to this, it was a   
 rural area.
