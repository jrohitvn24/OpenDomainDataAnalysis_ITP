   Many of the streets and squares of  
Hackney and Islington were laid out in 
the early 1900's for the rich,who,how- 
ever soon moved further out.The houses 
were taken by poorer people and,without
the resources to maintain them many    
homes were threatened by the bulldozer.
Then in the 1960's individuals and     
property companies began to invest in  
some areas.Gentrification is a process 
by which middle and upper classes enter
a working class area.The size of the   
houses and nearness to central London  
were important factors.Good points are 
the improvement of the housing stock   
and better shopping facilities.Bad     
aspects are poorer groups being        
pushed out and so the housing problem  
is worsened,very high profits are made 
by speculators,and more up-market shops
lead to general higher prices.         </content>
