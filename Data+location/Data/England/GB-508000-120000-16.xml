		<title>16Local Roman History</title>
		<content>  At Old House Farm (16th C or earlier)
 a Roman well was excavated in 1939 by 
 S.E.Winbolt; he found enough potsherds
 to suggest a Roman Villa. Also, oyster
 shells were found in 2 nearby fields. 
 No structures remain today.  The site 
 lies about 320 yards southwest of the 
 Farm between two large lush meadows at
 different levels, surrounded by huge  
 oak and ash trees. The spring never   
 runs dry.  In 1940 Roman pottery was  
 found at adjacent Sproutes Farm. These
 finds went to the Sussex Archeological
 Society at Barbican House, Lewes.     
    Lignite is present in the stream   
 between Old House Farm and Gay Street,
 and this with other minerals in the   
 area could be a reason for the early  
 Roman/Saxon settlement along nearby   
 Stane Street.  Roman coins were found 
 at Gaywood, and a Roman tile factory  
 was excavated at nearby Itchingfield. </content>
