		<title>03NORTHAM BURROWS</title>
		<content> The Burrows lie near the estuary of   
 the Rivers Taw and Torridge. They     
 cover approx. 650 acres. The Pebble   
 Ridge is two miles long and keeps the 
 sea from flooding-in on the Burrows. A
 man called Inkerman Rogers discovered 
 that the force of the sea brought the 
 pebbles forward many miles and a they 
 travlled they were rounded, and then  
 washed ashore to form the ridge. But  
 the rdige is now slowly being         
 destroyed and there is danger of      
 flooding.                             
                                       
 Many birds feed on the Burrows, and   
 there is also a Golf Course. In 1973  
 the Burrows were mae a Country Park by
 Devon County Council, and hundreds of 
 people visit the Burrows every year   
 for recreation.
