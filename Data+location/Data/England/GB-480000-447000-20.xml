		<content>{Q. How do you think policing in the   
{area will change over the next few    
{years?}                               
 A. It shouldn't change a lot, but in  
 the next year the prison at Full      
 Sutton will be opening and this may   
 increase personnel. Also in the case  
 of prisoners escaping, some form of   
 roadblock would be necessary but this 
 is not expected to be a problem       
 because the building is modern, built 
 with the knowledge of previous        
 problems. However, prisoners families 
 will either move into the area or     
 continually visit, causing an increase
 in the population and so larger       
 numbers of police will be required.   
{Q. Out of the crimes committed, what  
{percentage are solved? }              
 A. The detection rate for the country 
 is 20% to 30%, but so far this year we
 are averaging 30% to 40%.             </content>
