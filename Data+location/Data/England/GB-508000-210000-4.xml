		<title>04THE HERTS AGRICULTURAL SHOW</title>
		<content>    {The Herts Show}is a big           
 agricultural event that happens every 
 year in the Whitsuntide weekend.It is 
 held at{Friars Wash}a large open field
 just north of the village.It is a two 
 day event and this year over{26,000 } 
 people came over the two days.To get  
 in it costs Â£3.50 for adults and Â£1.50
 for children and old age pensioners.  
   {REDBOURN}is part of an agricultural
 community,with 15 farms around it.This
 is why it is probably held here.      
    Mr.Mark Dicken,secretary of the    
{Hertfordshire Agricultural Society,}  
 who organizes it says,"We are trying  
 to bring farming to the public in the 
 best possible light."This was done by 
 putting the animals in Marquees where 
 the public could get a good look at   
 them.                                 
    Also for the farmers they have     
 competitions for all sorts of animals.</content>
