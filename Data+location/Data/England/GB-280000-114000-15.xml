		<title>15CLUBS AND SOCIETIES</title>
		<content> In the Witheridge area there are a    
 number of clubs and societies which   
 cater for all ages.Many of them meet  
 at the Parish Hall which is registered
 with the charity commissioners.       
   For young people there are cubs and 
 brownies , girl guides and scouts.    
 There is also a youth club which      
 has its own premises.For the very     
 young there is a playgroup which meets
 twice a week.A new group to the area  
 is the majorettes.                    
    Adults have clubs ranging from an  
 over-60's club , Women's Institute ,  
 young farmers club and a gardening    
 society.There is a flourishing Drama  
 Group which presents a play annually.
