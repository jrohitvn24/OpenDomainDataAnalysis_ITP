		<title>18STOKE ORCHARD STATISTICS</title>
		<content> All references to{marriages, burials  
{and baptisms}before 1814 at Stoke     
 Orchard are in the registers of St.   
 Michael &amp; All Angels at Bishops       
 Cleeve.  Stoke Orchard Church was not 
 licenced for marriages until 1947.    
 Since then there have been 22 couples 
 married there.  The earliest          
 references in the{Tredington Registers
 are:- Burial  1541                    
       Baptism 1549 This date could be 
       earlier but part of the page is 
       torn away.                      
       Marriages 1601                  
 It was ordered by Henry VIII in 1538  
 that registers should be kept in all  
 parishes.  The early registers are now
 kept at the County Record Office in   
 Gloucester.  In Tredington Churchyard 
 there are the steps and the slender   
 shaft of a 9 foot,{14th Century Cross.
