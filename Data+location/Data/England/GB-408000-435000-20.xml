		<content> Towards the bottom of the Main Street 
 is the old Manor House. Above the door
 the date the house was built can be   
 clearly seen _ 1684. All the windows  
 are very small and some of them have  
 been bricked up. This was due to a    
 window tax that was imposed soon after
 the house was built. The house is     
 built out of local sandstone, as is   
 the old barn at the back.             
      Near the top of the village by   
 the Ling Bob public house is          
 Providence Mill. It was built in 1840.
 The workers cottages are close by the 
 mill and so is the mill masters house.
      Further down Main Street from    
 Manor House is the Old Smithy. It was 
 built in 1790 and is still in use     
 today. Horses are still taken to the  
 village smithy for shoeing.
