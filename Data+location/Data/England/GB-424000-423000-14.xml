		<title>14Fire Guts Mill</title>
		<content>  "A fire which started on Sunday      
 12th May did an estimated Â£1 million  
 worth of dammage.It took about 120    
 firemen from all over West Yorkshire  
 to put out the fire at the mill.The   
 mill was 120 years of age and used for
 storing aircraft components and owned 
 by William Holden.The firemen used 20 
 pieces of equipment to control the    
 fire which was well a blaze at most   
 times.Hundreds of people stopped to   
 have a look at the blazing inferno and
 people were evacuated from near by    
 houses incase there was a danger of   
 the fire spreading.The fire chief said
 that there was magnesium inside the   
 building .It collided with the water  
 causing explosions inside the         
 building.Fortunately there were no    
 injuries or lives lost in the fire."
