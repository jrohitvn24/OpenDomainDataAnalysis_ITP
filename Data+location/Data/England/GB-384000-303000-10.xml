		<title>10The Council Offices, Codsall</title>
		<content>Children from Codsall Middle School    
visited the Offices and found out the  
following information. The South       
Staffordshire District was formed in   
l974 following local government        
re-organisation and it was decided to  
close the old Cannock District Council 
offices at Penkridge and those of the  
former Seisdon District Council at     
Wombourne and transfer all departments 
to new offices to be built in centrally
located Codsall. They were opened in   
1976 at a cost of about 1 000 000      
pounds. About 200 people are employed  
in the offices which deal with these   
services. The Health Department checks 
that shops serve food in hygienic      
conditions and also tries to prevent   
damage to health from air pollution by 
checking on fumes from factories. The  
Engineers Dept. repair and build sewers
and co operate with the water board.   </content>
