		<content> We talked to Mrs Drayton.  She owns a 
 small hotel in{SANDOWN.} She said     
 during the Spring for about twelve    
 weeks she has lots of{SCHOOL PARTIES. 
 They come from sll parts of the       
 country but mostly from London.  After
 breakfast they go out by coach all day
 to visit places like Robin Hill,      
 Carisbrooke Castle and Blackgang      
 Chine.  After tea they use the dining 
 room as a classroom to do some work.  
 Mr Drayton does the cooking.  He did  
 44 poached eggs last night.  They have
 a disco each week.  Their season goes 
 from March to October.  Sometimes they
 take old people in Winter who have    
 come out of hospital and are not      
 allowed to go home on their own.      
 There are 120 hotels in this part of  
 the island.  Mrs Drayton does all the 
 organising.
