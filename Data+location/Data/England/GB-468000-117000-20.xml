		<title>20EDUCATION/WORK IN CLANFIELD</title>
		<content> Schooling began in Clanfield in       
 1880.The present middle school was    
 built in the 1920's and was extended  
 in 1971 and again in 1978.There are   
 279 pupils, boys and girls between the
 ages of 8 and 12 years receiving a    
 primary education.When they leave     
 school there is little employment in  
 the area as agriculture is no longer  
 labour intensive. They must move away 
 from home or find work in the nearby  
 towns of Portsmouth,Havant or         
 Petersfield. Oil has been found nearby
 and it remains to be seen what effect 
 this will have in the future.
