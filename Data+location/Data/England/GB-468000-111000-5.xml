		<content> Pupils of Hart Plain Middle School    
 interviewed Mrs. Carruthers who is    
 the Cowplain Ward Councillor, she said
 that she has been a councillor for six
 years. Before she was a councillor she
 was a teacher of china painting. She  
 said that she enjoys her job very     
 much. She said her duties were at one 
 time Housing and Amenities and now    
 include Recreation, Environmental     
 Health and Cowplain Ward. Then she    
 said that she served on the           
 subcommittees of Havant Arts Centre,  
 which serves the Borough of Havant in 
 the Old Town Hall and Cowplain        
 Activity Centre. She also said that   
 anyone can ask for help as long as    
 they are in her ward. An improvement  
 she would like to see in the future is
 the building of a swimming pool in    
 Waterlooville.
