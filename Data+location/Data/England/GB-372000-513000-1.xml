		<title>01About our D-block.</title>
		<content> Our 12km block is packed out with     
 countryside.It is in the Eden valley  
 in Cumbria.The land in the valley is  
 hilly with some woodland.The river    
 Eden runs through our block on its way
 to the Solway Firth,and the fells,the 
 Pennines,run at the edge of our block.
 There are a lot of farms in our block 
 and most of them are dairy farms with 
 some sheep farming.Few crops are grown
 -turnips, potatoes and barley, but    
 the main crop is grass as silage or   
 hay.There is only one village in our  
 block and two small hamlets with      
 scattered farmhouses.The nearest town 
 is Appleby,about 5 miles away. Many   
 people work on farms or in jobs       
 connected with farming. Many people   
 have lived in this area for all their 
 lives, although there are some people 
 who have moved here from towns and    
 cities.                               </content>
