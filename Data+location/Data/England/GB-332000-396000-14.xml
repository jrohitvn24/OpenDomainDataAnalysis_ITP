		<content> Transport in our area is important.We 
 rely on it for a number of functions  
 ie.travel to and from shops,work,     
 school and social engagements.We have 
 a range of transport the most popular 
 being the bus service.We have two main
 bus companies,the Ribble and the      
 Merseyside County Council service.Both
 companies operate a frequent and      
 efficient service.                    
 The train services link Liverpool to  
 Southport and Liverpool to Ormskirk,  
 this being a quicker way to travel.   
 Most people own their own cars and    
 find this the most effective way to   
 go from A to B at anytime.Some people 
 use their cars as taxis thus          
 benefiting others.                    
 Our area is close to Bootle Docks and 
 the Free Port of Liverpool.The goods  
 imported are deposited at container   
 bases and then moved by road and rail.</content>
