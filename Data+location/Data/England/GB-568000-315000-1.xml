		<title>01The East Winch Area</title>
		<content> This block is mainly rural area lying 
 about five miles east of the town of  
 King's Lynn. It contains two centres  
 of population named East Winch, the   
 larger and West Bilney. These villages
 are inhabited largely by people who   
 work in either King's Lynn or the     
 nearby market town of Swaffham. Both  
 towns are easily accessible on the    
 main road which runs through both     
 villages. This road is named the A47  
 and carries a great deal of traffic   
 from the Midlands, in the west, to the
 county city of Norwich and the holiday
 centre and east coast port of Great   
 Yarmouth. The road divides the East   
 Winch and, after pressure from local  
 people, has recently been limited to  
 50 mph. The block also contains       
 several farms, two churches, a primary
 school and a few shops. But most      
 people travel to King's Lynn for shops</content>
