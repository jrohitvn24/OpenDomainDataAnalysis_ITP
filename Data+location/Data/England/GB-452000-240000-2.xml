		<content> Farming affects much of the life of   
 the area.                             
 The Marston Estate and its tenant     
 farms follow the policy of mixed      
 farming. There are two dairy herds on 
 the estate and one at Manor Farm. Beef
 and sheep are reared but the most     
 important is arable farming. The      
 tenant farms in our area are Home Farm
 Marston St Lawrence, Manor Farm       
 Marston St Lawrence and Westhorpe     
 Manor Farm Greatworth.                
 Greatworth's Farms cultivate to       
 produce cereals and beef,kale is      
 grown for cattle feeding. The land is 
 too heavy for potatoes.Hay is made in 
 the summer months for winter feed.    
 Most of the corn is autumn sown with  
 wheat, barley and some beans produced.
 The farm also keeps sheep. The two    
 breeds used are Border Leicester and  
 Suffolk.                              </content>
