		<content> The storage towers at Doddington and  
Earls Barton are made of concrete and  
are circular with domed roofs. The     
Earls Barton tower holds 400,000       
gallons of water and the Doddington    
one 30,000 gallons.They are filled to  
capacity during the night and the      
water is drawn off at peak times       
during the day,such as mornings or     
evenings, or if there is a sudden      
emergency, such as a burst water main. 
The two towers serve the surrounding   
villages and part of Wellingborough.   
At present all service pipes under-    
ground are black iron pipes; but they  
are in the process of  being replaced  
with more pliable blue plastic pipes.  
These will be long lasting and more    
easily distinguished from the new red  
electricity pipes and new yellow gas   
pipes which will all be lying together 
under the ground.                      </content>
