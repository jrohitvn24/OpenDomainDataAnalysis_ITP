		<title>13COMMUNITY CENTRE</title>
		<content> The Morton Manor Community Centre     
 plays a significant role in the life  
 of the area.Situated in beautiful open
 parkland it was formerly the home of  
 the Ferguson Chance family.The house  
 was presented to the people in 1960 on
 the death of Sir Robert Chance but it 
 was not opened as a community center  
 until 1965.                           
 The center is today used by 3000 to   
 4000 people a week it is open six days
 a week from 9.00 am to 10.00 pm.There 
 is a full time staff led by a warden  
 who looks after all the day to day    
 workings of the center but they are   
 accountable to a management committee 
 composed of local people and          
 councillors.Every one who uses the    
 centre has to become a member and has 
 to pay a fee dependant upon age.The   
 young members and old age pensioners  
 pay least.                            </content>
