		<title>06FAST FOOD SHOPS IN SLOUGH</title>
		<content>     Slough has five fast food shops,  
 which demonstrates the demand for such
 outlets.As more of these kind of shops
 open,smaller,more traditional cafes   
 are forced to close.                  
   The burger shops are usually large, 
 bright and cheerful American -run     
 firms,which have a vending company    
 behind them supporting the very       
 expensive buying and maintaining of   
 the machinery required.               
  The pizza shops are the most popular 
 at the moment as people said they     
 think of them as healthy.             
   The fish and chip shops are the     
 safest bet for a trader as the demand 
 is consistent.                        
   All these shops cause a problem in  
 the streets as litter is blown about  
 and people don't make proper use of   
 the bins provided.                    
                                       </content>
