		<title>14LORD METHUEN AND CORSHAM</title>
		<content>   The Methuen family have owned the   
 Court for 240 years. The present Lord 
 Methuen inherited the title and land  
 in 1974. The estate covers 3000 acres.
   The Court itself has 102 rooms; 60% 
 is occupied by the Bath Academy of    
 Art, 20% is open to the public and the
 remaining 20% is the home of Lord     
 Methuen.                              
   When the public visits the Court    
 they can see 145 'Old Masters',       
 furniture of great value including 35 
 identical chairs, carpets and china.  
 Lord Methuen said that he will not be 
 having popular attractions like those 
 at nearby Longleat. He prefers the    
 Court to be quiet and is presently    
 involved in constructing an arboretum 
 of 400 different species of trees. In 
 all he has 100,000 trees.
