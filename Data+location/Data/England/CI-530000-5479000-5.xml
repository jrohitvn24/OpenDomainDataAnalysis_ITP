		<content> An ambitious building programme has   
 been permitted by the buoyant local   
 economy and two major capital works   
 are included in this survey area.     
 A new prison is replacing the present 
 victorian structure inconvenienty     
 situated in the centre of St. Peter   
 Port.The new building will house its  
 inmates in more suitable surroundings 
 in the near future.                   
 Another major project has been the    
 construction of the new coeducational 
 Grammar School which was completed in 
 February of this year. It is an       
 ambitious design and incorporates     
 excellent sporting and academic       
 facilities for 800 pupils. The school 
 is intended to become a community     
 education centre.
