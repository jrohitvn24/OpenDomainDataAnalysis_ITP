		<title>16A DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> I am a pupil at Sherborne school. I   
 come to school in my mum's car from   
 Northleach with my friend Julie. We   
 set out about ten minutes to nine.    
 When I get to school sometimes I play,
 but usually the bell is ringing when I
 get there.When we go in we hang up our
 coats and bags and our headmaster does
 the register.We have assembly.After,  
 we sometimes read.Then I do my        
 handwriting.At playtime I have my     
 milk. After the bell has rung we do   
 some maths.After we have done that we 
 have lunch.I have sandwiches for      
 lunch. We all eat in the junior class.
 After lunch we have a playtime. We go 
 in at one o'clock.If we haven't       
 finished all of our work we finish it 
 off.Sometimes we do running in the    
 summer and we might have a game of    
 football in the winter.We go home at a
 quarter past three.                   </content>
