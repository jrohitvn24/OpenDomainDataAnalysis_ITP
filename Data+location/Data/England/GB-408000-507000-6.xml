		<title>06Sheep Farming</title>
		<content>   Sheep are the main form of livestock
 bred and reared in this hill farming  
 area. Although there are a mixture of 
 certain  breeds  such  as  Suffolk,   
 Leicester  or   Suffolk and Leicester 
 crosses, Teeswater  etc.,  one of the 
 most  popular  breeds  is  the  local 
 Swaledale because it is  hardy as well
 as productive. Present prices for 'run
 of the mill' sheep can vary from about
 Â£30  to  Â£100  but  a  good individual
 breeding stock animal, particularly a 
 ram can fetch Â£8,000 or more. Breeders
 in the area usually enter their best  
 animals at the local shows and it is  
 these show champions which bring these
 premium price.                        
  By law, sheep have to be dipped twice
 per year,  in  Autumn,  in  order  to 
 prevent 'sheep scab'.   They are also 
 'drenched'  or  'wormed'  and  their  
 hooves sprayed to avoid 'foot rot'.   </content>
