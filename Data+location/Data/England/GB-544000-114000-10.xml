		<content> The 'Half way House' was a staging    
 post between Lewes and Uckfield. The  
 'Old Ship' dates from the Sixteenth   
 century and was a staging post for the
 barges which sailed up the River Ouse 
 from Newhaven and Lewes. At that time 
 the river was about eight feet wider  
 than it is today. A butchers shop     
 adjoined the Inn so that boats could  
 also be provisioned here.             
  A mummified cat, walled up, probably 
 alive, in a sitting position, was     
 found during recent rennovations and  
 it is thought that it was put there to
 ward off evil spirits.                
  The 'Anchor Inn' is also very old and
 was also used as a stopping place for 
 river traffic                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
