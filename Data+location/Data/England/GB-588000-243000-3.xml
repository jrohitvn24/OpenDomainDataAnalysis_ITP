		<content>  Until the present school was built in
1970 there was a Victorian school near 
the church.The village then,was mostly 
near the church with a blacksmith's    
shop and a post office.In the last 40  
years the village centre has moved and 
is now close to the Sudbury and        
Lavenham road.The old village is a     
quiet walk from where most people live 
now.                                   
  Another old part of the village is   
Garrison Lane,and this has not changed 
much.There used to be a farm there     
which supplied the village with milk   
which was taken round by pony and cart.
There has been pig farming in the      
village for years and there used to be 
a slaughter house where Chestnut Close 
now stands.
