		<title>06PRE-WAR HOUSES IN BECKLEY</title>
		<content>Most of the houses in the older part of
the village are built of stone. Some of
them have thatched roofs but many are  
tiled. Most of these older houses were 
built before 1800 but since the 1939-45
War many have been joined together to  
form larger dwellings. Most of them    
have little or no front gardens but    
have large back gardens. Climbing roses
make many of the cottages very         
attractive in the summer. Some         
bungalows were built along the         
Woodperry Road in the years between the
two World Wars. They were constructed  
of brick. A few made of wood or        
asbestos have since been clad in brick 
or rendered. Our survey showed that    
about 60% of the houses have some      
double glazing and most of them are    
heated by oil but coal, wood and       
electricty are quite popular.
