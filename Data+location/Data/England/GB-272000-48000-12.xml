		<content> Loddiswell School, housed as it is in 
 a very old building, with no nearby   
 school field for easy access for games
 and environmental work, is quite hard 
 pressed to provide with ease the wide 
 curriculum that is expected of primary
 schools today.It tries to compensate. 
 Each week the top class travels by bus
 to Kingsbridge Sports Centre for      
 games. The school has had its own     
 learners swimming pool and achieves   
 100% success. Much use of 'helpful'   
 mothers has been made to widen the    
 curriculum; Craft, Art, Cookery etc.  
 The Parent-Teachers Association has   
 done much to help provide much needed 
 educational equipment.                
 Staffing:-Teachers: Head and two full-
 time and one part-time. Ancilliary:   
 Caretaker, Cook, Kitchen Helper, two  
 Mealtime Assistants, part-time        
 Secretary and Road Crossing Patrol.   </content>
