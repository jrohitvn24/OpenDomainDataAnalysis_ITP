		<title>10CABLE TV IN CROYDON</title>
		<content>  Cable  TV is the latest thing in     
 Croydon.Two local businessmen had the 
 idea and named the company CROYDON    
 CABLE.Croydon Cable will have thirty  
 channels of diffrent subjects for all 
 the family.It will cost #5.95 for     
 seven channels per month which is the 
 minimum of channels you can have.They 
 have started laying cable for New     
 Addington and their studio is there.It
 will take five years for the whole of 
 Croydon to recieve cable television.It
 is costing #40 million to start.The   
 studio recieves pictures from a       
 satillite in space 23,000 miles away, 
 then it is sent through the           
 underground cables to your TV set.    
 Altogether there is a one tenth of a  
 second delay, then you  recieve top   
 quality sound and pictures.We are all 
 very excited at the prospect of having
 Cable TV on the Forestdale estate.    </content>
