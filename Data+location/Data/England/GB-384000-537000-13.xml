		<content> Most houses in the area have tele-    
 vision but it is not possible yet to  
 get Channel 4. Most people also have a
 radio and some have videos. Newspapers
 are delivered from the newsagent at   
 Wearhead and the Post Office at St.   
 John's Chapel. Those for people in    
 outlying areas are left for collection
 from boxes on or near the main road.  
 Sunday papers are brought by car from 
 Stanhope. The council publishes a free
 weekly 'The Wear Valley Advertiser'. A
 monthly parish magazine 'The Source'  
 is the joint publication of the Meth- 
 odist and Aglican Churches. Every 2 or
 3 years the Weardale Field Study      
 Society publish a magazine 'The Bonny 
 Moor Hen'. 2 mobile library vans from 
 Crook cover the area once a fortnight.
 They have an excellent ordering serv- 
 ice and will also obtain new books for
 borrowers who wish to buy.            </content>
