		<title>12The Tupsley Area.</title>
		<content>  The Tupsley area is predominantly    
 residential . Many of the houses have 
 been erected since the second World   
 War and there two very new estates    
 built in the last ten years.          
                                       
   The majority of the buildings are   
 detached or semi-detached houses.Very 
 few are terraced homes.               
                                       
   The older houses are concentrated   
 near the bottom of Old Eign Hill,     
 along the main Hampton Bishop         
 road which runs parallel to the river.
                                       
    A small industrial estate has grown
 near to the Hampton Bishop road but is
 restricted , because of the space     
 available , to a dozen or so small    
 businesses.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
