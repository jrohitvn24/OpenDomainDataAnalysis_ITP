		<title>18ARLEY WORKING MENS' CLUB</title>
		<content> The club is a focal point for the     
 community. It is known locally as the 
 "Jampot". It was founded by the miners
 from Arley colliery (closed 1968) the 
 majority of which moved from Durham   
 when the mines opened- "Jammie" is a  
 slang word for northener. The club    
 committee had to apply twice before   
 they were allowed to build the club,  
 the original building being based on  
 second hand timbers. The land that was
 used was a disused army camp - 2 old  
 huts were removed to make way for the 
 club.                                 
 The club has a history of involvement 
 in the community and its members were 
 acknowledged locally as "grand chaps; 
 bluff and hearty, kind and generous".
