		<content>    Mrs. T.Barnes(now Amott) covered   
 the walls of her house with shells in 
{1977,}it took one year to complete.   
 The shells were found by friends,     
 neighbours and local fishermen, and   
 were varnished after she put them in  
 place. {There are 19 varieties of     
{shells }including mussells, cockles,  
 scallops &amp; razor shells. On the walls 
 are pictures of figures, amimals &amp;    
 birds; {they are all people who Mrs.  
{Amott has known and creatures she has 
{seen.}There is a peacock, a seagull, a
 shepherd with sheep, a squirrel, a    
 girl riding a horse with a foal &amp; Mrs.
 Amott's alsatian. In her garden she   
 has made a castle, a windmill and a   
 wishing well with shells. {She found a
{cannon ball in her garden which she   
{thinks may have come from Camber      
{Castle.}The Shell House can be found  
 at Morlais Ridge,Winchelsea Beach.    </content>
