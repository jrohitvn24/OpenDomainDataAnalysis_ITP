		<title>04BRAILES,THE FARMING PATTERN</title>
		<content> The area is divided into medium       
 sized arable and livestock farms.Wheat
 and barley are the main crops with    
 lesser amounts of oilseed rape, oats, 
 beans and potatoes. Substantial       
 numbers of animals are maintained _   
 cattle for milk and beef, sheep for   
 meat and wool,and pigs.               
   Barley straw is used to feed        
 livestock. Much of the wheat straw is 
 used for litter though a small        
 quantity is being chemically treated  
 to be  used as fodder. The surplus is 
 disposed of by burning or ploughing   
 in.                                   
   Grassland, some permanent, mostly   
 temporary, is used for grazing and    
 providing winter fodder for livestock 
 in the form of silage and hay.
