		<title>14FARM SHOPS</title>
		<content>   Near the edge of Blofield there are 
 two farm shops.  These combine two    
 activities.  Near the shops,which are 
 barns, there are fields of fruit and  
 vegetables where at the appropriate   
 season you are able to go and         
 pick_your_own.  Many people come from 
 around Norwich to pick fruit such as  
 strawberries,raspberries,gooseberries 
 and black currents, which they want to
 put in a freezer or make into jam or  
 wine.  These crops are much cheaper   
 than those in the shops or market in  
 Norwich.   Vegetables that you can    
 pick include beetroot, calabrese, peas
 and beans.                            
   The farm shops also sell fruit and  
 vegetables, some of which come from   
 overseas, such as oranges, apples and 
 peaches.
