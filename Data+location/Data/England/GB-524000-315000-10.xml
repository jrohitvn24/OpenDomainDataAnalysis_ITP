		<content>      Our school is 273 years old. It  
 has two classes. There is an old      
 school house and a playground and a   
 garden. It is a church school standing
 beside St. Marys Church. A man called 
 Thomas Andrew gave the land and       
 William Guy built the school in 1712. 
      Cowbit only has 50 pupils and    
 school begins at 09.00hrs and finishes
 at 15.30.We learn Maths,English,Story

 folders.We also have a swimming lesson
 once a week when the whole school goes
 to Spalding on a coach to the Swimming
 Pool. P.E. is also once a week.       
      We go to church about once a term
 when our vicar takes special services 
 at Easter, School Leavers, Harvest and
 Christmas.
