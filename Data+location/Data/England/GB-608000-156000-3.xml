		<title>03 Life in Chartham Hatch</title>
		<content>We met the wives of two Parish         
Councillors, they lived in mellow      
bungalows merging with the woods. The  
older lady and her husband had designed
and built their own bungalow ten years 
previously.The other younger lady had  
also lived there for ten years.We      
learnt the following information from  
these people:                          
There were enough retired folk in the  
village to fill 3 cars when they       
visited the over-sixties club in       
Chartham. More younger people appeared 
to be moving into the village. There   
was only one bus service a day, the bus
leaving for Canterbury at 10.30am and  
returning at 1.30pm. Clearly some form 
of motorised transport was essential   
if you lived here.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
