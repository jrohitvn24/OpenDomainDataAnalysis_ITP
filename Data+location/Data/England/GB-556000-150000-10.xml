		<content> Shipbourne last century had everything
 the people needed.People had work     
 without going out of the village.There
 were shops and a school for children  
 from all around.Most people worked on 
 the Fairlawn Estate.Many people were  
 needed to work in the fields because  
 there was no machinery.               
   The school log book tells us that a 
 number of children were off school    
 working on the land by reaping the    
 corn, stringing the hops,stone        
 picking,sowing beans and cutting the  
 hops.We can tell that hops were grown 
 in Shipbourne by the number of        
 converted oast houses that are here.  
   Mr.Cazalet,the owner of Fairlawn,   
 built many of the houses that there   
 are in Shipbourne,such as New         
 Cottages.He also built a new church   
 for the village.
