		<title>02CHRISTCHURCH OLD AND NEW</title>
		<content> Christchurch has changed enormously   
 since it was a village community      
 hundreds of years ago.Towards the quay
 and the town centre ,many old         
 buildings still survive.This is my    
 favourite part of the town.The{Priory 
 is a beautiful building,Christchurch's
 main landmark.The{castle}and the      
{Constable's House,}though in ruin,add 
 to the town's character.Some old and  
 very pretty cottages stand by the     
 Priory gates.There are few old houses 
 left in Christchurch now.A newer part 
 of the town is called Jumpers,where I 
 live.The housing is about 35 years    
 old.There are new housing developments
 at Fairmile.{Saxon Square}is new for  
 shopping.It is well designed and      
 attractive,but generally I prefer the 
 older part of the town to the new.
