		<title>02Survey of Parents in Codsall</title>
		<content>We surveyed the parents of children at 
Codsall Middle School, asking them to  
complete a questionnaire. These are the
main results given as an impression    
rather than a detailed statistical     
record.                                
Most parents were born in the West     
Midlands but not in Codsall. The main  
birthplace being Wolverhampton.        
Codsall's development as a dormitory   
settlement is evidenced by the length  
of habitation. Very few parents have   
lived here all their lives. Most put   
down 10-20 years, reflecting the ages  
of our intake. Codsall is well provided
with shops,though several requests for 
Sunday opening reflect a current       
debate. Leisure facilities are thought 
satisfactory. Requests for squash court
and more provisios for youngsters in   
the 13 to 18 age range were made.      
                                       </content>
