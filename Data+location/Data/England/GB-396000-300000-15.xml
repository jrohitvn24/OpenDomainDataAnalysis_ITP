 the Lower School which is for the     
 first two year groups.We have 12      
 different lessons,they are Maths,

 Craft.We have two subjects which      
 happen once every year for seven      
 weeks.One of these is Electronics     
 which we are having now,it interrupts 
 the Maths lessons.The other is        
 Computer Studies which interrupts     
 English;Coppice has 10 research       
 computers.At the moment the teachers  
 are on strike and sometimes we are    
 sent home because of this.On Thursdays
 Lower School has an assembly in the   
 main hall,we have a hymn,a short talk,
 a prayer and then notices.            </content>
