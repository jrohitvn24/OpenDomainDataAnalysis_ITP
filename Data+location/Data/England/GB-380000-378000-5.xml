		<content>  In the town we live there are a few  
 playschools, we visited one called    
 Kids.                                 
  The private playschool was           
 established in{September 1983}because 
 many parents needed to work for       
 financial reasons and to send their   
 children to a place to be looked      
 after.{150}children come to the       
 playschool but{only 45}are full       
 timers.                               
  The one to two year olds enjoy       
 playing with the sand and water but   
 the three to four year olds like      
 playing Mr. Men programs on the       
 computer. Although they are playing   
 they are learning at the same time.   
  Inside the playschool there is an    
 elephant shaped menu for lunch.In one 
 room there are cots for the babies to 
 sleep.                                
  The parents pay monthly.             </content>
