		<title>08THE EXMOUTH LIFEBOAT</title>
		<content> The main problems for lifeboat men    
 nowadays are windsurfers.The lifeboat 
 has on average a call of 1 a week     
 mostly because windsurfers get swept  
 out to sea. People don't realise how  
 quickly they lose strength and they   
 often go out too far or get caught in 
 currents. The service was for shipping
 but now it is mostly for leisure      
 activities. The Exmouth lifeboat is a 
 33ft brede which has a top speed of   
 23knots. It is the fastest in the     
 fleet. The Exmouth lifeboats are      
 powered by two 250 h.p. caterpiller   
 diesels which can operate upside down 
 though not at full speed. On average  
 the institution lifeboats are launched
 10 times a day throughout the country.
 Last year 1307 lives were saved and   
 they were lauched 3536 times for      
 various reasons including practices   
 and demonstrations.                   </content>
