		<content> beyond economic repair and the        
 Elsenham Community Association are    
 planning to build a smaller hall or   
 pavilion on the playing field as soon 
 as the necessary money can be raised. 
      This will involve selling the    
 site of the old community centre and  
 raising funds for the new building.   
 For its part the Parish Council have  
 already granted Â£3,000 towards the    
 provision of electricity and water and
 drainage services, and intend to sell 
 a piece of the playing field to the   
 Community Association at a normal     
 price to facilitate the scheme.       
      The playing field currently has  
 two football pitches and two all      
 weather tennis courts and it hopes    
 that the provision of a pavilion will 
 increase the amenity value of the     
 area.
