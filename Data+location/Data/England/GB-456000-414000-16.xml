		<content> There is a small{greyhound stadium}in 
 our area with meetings once a         
 fortnight. On the day of a race a     
 greyhound does not eat.At the stadium 
 the dog is weighed and put into a     
 kennel. Just before the race the dog  
 is paraded in front of the people. It 
 is given a muzzle and a race jacket.  
 The dog is put into the traps. When   
 the hare comes round the race starts. 
 After the race the dog is given a     
 drink and has its paws checked.       
 The{cricket club}is in Fenwick. They  
 play friendly matches with people from
 all around Fenwick. The cows graze    
 in the cricket field when there is no 
 match. The cows can not go where the  
 wickets are. There is a{lake}near the 
 brickworks. There are some wooden huts
 for the{fishing club}to use for       
 competitons. They catch all types of  
 freshwater fish.                      </content>
