		<title>07A Typical Saturday</title>
		<content> I live in a small village in          
 Leicestershire called Heather.  My    
 name is Nigel and I'm going to tell   
 you about a typical Saturday in my    
 life. I get up at 8.30, have a cup of 
 tea, have a shower, get dressed and   
 for breakfast I have kippers.  "Where 
 do you get them from?" I hear you ask.
 Well, my Dad works for Amy Roadstone  
 Corporation and he has to travel to   
 different places.  One is Lowestoft,  
 where he is able to buy really tasty  
 ones.  After breakfast I practise on  
 my piano and watch television until   
 dinner time.  In the afternoon I make 
 and paint a model ship called H.M.S.  
 Conqueror.   For tea I have salad.    
 Then I spend fifteen minutes          
 practising on my piano.  Afterwards I 
 watch the television until 10.00, then
 I go to bed.                          
                                       </content>
