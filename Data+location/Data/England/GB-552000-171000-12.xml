		<content>  Dartford has been lived in for many  
years and it has an interesting history
which you can find out about by        
visiting the local museum. It has an   
old Roman stone coffin which was found 
on East Hill and the original skeleton 
was of a rich Roman lady. The skeleton 
now in the coffin is an assortment of  
male and female bones. The museum also 
has a model of the Holy Trinity Norman 
Church and the architect who designed  
it also designed part of the Tower of  
London and Rochester Castle. It also   
has two stuffed Dartford Warblers,     
birds now only found in Hampshire and

stuffed fox and cat. There is a very   
old glass bowl which was found when

Park hospital. It is called the Darent 
Bowl and it is a very unique item.
