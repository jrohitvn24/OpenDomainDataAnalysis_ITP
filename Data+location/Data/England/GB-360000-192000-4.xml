 Oldbury has a big Nuclear Power       
 Station five miles from the village.  
 The Power Station has about 600 men   
 employed there some of the villagers  
 work there but most are from outside  
 the village.  The Power Station covers
 an area of 175 acres of land and 380  
 acres of river bed.  When the Power   
 Station was built it affected farmers.
 They lost lots of land, some farmers  
 had over 100 acres and now have only  
 50 acres.                             
    Oldbury was the third Power Station
 to be opened on the Severn Estuary    
 and was opened on 10th June, 1969.    
    The Power Station helps in local   
 events and this is appreciated by the 
 villagers.
