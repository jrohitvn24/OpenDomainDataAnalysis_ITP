		<content> One disused timber frame farmhouse has
 been preserved from ruin by being     
 converted into a large barn for a     
 neighbouring farm.                    
                                       
 The R.C church in Broxwood was built  
 in 1863 by the estate owners. The dark
 grey stone building with lancet       
 windows is little used and currently  
 is up for sale.                       
                                       
 The former independant chapel in      
 Broxwood, also in grey stone, and the 
 adjoining school, have both been sold 
 and converted into private residences 
                                       
 The "Old Workhouse" at Whitehill, a   
 large red brick building dating from  
 about 1836, is still used as Rural    
 District offices but is also in the   
 process of being converted by the     
 local authority into residences.      </content>
