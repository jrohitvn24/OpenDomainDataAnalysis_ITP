		<content> In 1382,a five storey castle,whose    
 ruins are dramatic,was built to       
 replace the earlier"motte and baily"  
 castle whose outline can still be     
 seen.Among several royal prisoners    
 was the daughter of Edward IV,Princess
 Elizabeth of York,sent there by       
 Richard III.When the latter was killed
 in 1485,Elizabeth was married to Henry
 VII.The castle was the Northern       
 favourite of Henry VIII,who gave it to
 his bastard son,Duke of Richmond.It   
 was last inhabited in 1547.           
{The Park}(a Grade 1 listed building)In
 1619,a hall was biult in the 14th c.  
 Park,to replace the castle.Stone,oak  
 panelling,lead and stone tiles from   
 the castle were re-used in the new    
 residence.In 1730 it was faced with   
 red brick in Queen Anne style.Statues 
 made in 1638,by known craftsmen,still 
 stand in the Park.                    </content>
