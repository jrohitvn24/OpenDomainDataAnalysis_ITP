		<content>      The majority of the block is     
 rural and this is reflected in the    
 housing of the area.Apart from the    
 small village of {Preston Gubbals  }  
 and the 'ribbon' development at {Upper
{Battlefield,}there are no sizable     
 groups of dwellings.                  
      There are a few large farmhouses 
 that are very attractive; notably {   
{Smethcote Manor}in the north(black and
 white),{Wood Farm, Hadnall }and the   
 farmhouse opposite {Albrighton Hall.  
{    }There are many pairs of cottages 
 and isolated holdings all rather small
 but well kept.                        
      The {Upper Battlefield}group     
 consists of about 18 mainly detached  
 houses, some wooden 'chalet' type     
 bungalows, and a number of 'between   
 the wars'detatched houses. All of     
 these are on the east side of the {   
{A49. }                                </content>
