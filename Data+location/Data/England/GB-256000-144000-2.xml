		<title>02THE EARL OF TYRONE</title>
		<content>       This is the story of the Earl Of
 Tyrone.He was wanted for high-treason 
 many years ago.High-treason was a     
 crime against the king and was very   
 serious so he fled from Scotland and  
 hid in the Parish of Martin's         
 Coombe.He had to go to Ladyswood which
 was at the top of the village because 
 it was the only safe place.Soon the   
 word got round that he was in Martin's
 Coombe and some Brigadiers set out to 
 find him.They went down every allyway 
 to find him and eventualy someone     
 found him.He was carried down the road
 with his hands tied.The villagers     
 rejoyst at the capture of the Earl.   
 When they reached the beach they shot 
 him and let him float out to sea.     
        We carry on the tradition year 
 after year and have lots of fun.
