		<title>17Games Children Play!</title>
		<content>To find out the favourite games of     
children between 6-10 years old.We did 
a survey by going to Tillington First  
School and asking the children which   
games they liked to play and asking a  
few of our 1st years.We found out that 
the most popular game was french       
elastic.The only thing needed to play  
this game is a piece of long elastic.  
Two people stand in the elastic and the
third person has to jump in,out and    
on the elastic.The two people at either
end move the elastic to different      
heights.The second best was tig.To play
this game you need quite a few people. 
One person is "on" and chases the other
people.When he\she catches someone they
are "on."A few other popular games are:
football,hide'n'seek,cricket,hopscotch,
playfights,bulldog,kisschase,leapfrog, 
cars and whats the time Mr.Wolf?
