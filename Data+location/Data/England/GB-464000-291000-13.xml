		<title>13FAVOURITE T.V.PROGRAMMES</title>
		<content> Most of the children spend much of    
 their free time watching television.  
 The most unpopular programme was the  
 news because either the children did  
 not understand politics or the        
 programme was always about people     
 being hurt and showing frightening    
 pictures. The favourite programmes    
 were cartoons mainly because the      
 characters were easy to draw. Top of  
 the list included space adventures,   
 Blue Peter, Top of the Pops,          
 police/detective stories and          
 programmes for family entertainment.  
 Quiz shows were not popular because   
 the children found the questions too  
 hard to answer.                       
 The Radio was only used for listening 
 to pop music during the day. 60% of   
 the children had their own television 
 in their bedrooms which they watched  
 in bed at night.                      </content>
