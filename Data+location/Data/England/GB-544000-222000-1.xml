		<title>01GENERAL SURVEY</title>
		<content>     The area is pleasantly            
 undulating,with many small villages   
 and hamlets in or near the river      
 valleys; particulary the Ash          
 valley, which cut into the land.The   
 upperchalk forms the main rock but it 
 is covered by glacial drift, which    
 becomes very sticky, as we soon find  
 out in the school in the winter! There
 are also patches of gravel and London 
 Clay in the Ash valley, the latter was
 used to make the bricks of Hadham     
 Hall. The clays have allowed more     
 surface drainage than is usual on     
 chalk and have produced a heavy but   
 fertile soil. On the east side of the 
 Ash valley an unconformity occurs     
 where Reading beds rest on chalk.
