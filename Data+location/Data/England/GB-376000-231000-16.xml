		<title>16The Weather in Pendock</title>
		<content> The weather in Pendock is very odd and
 can change in minutes or even seconds.
 We keep a weather chart and see which 
 way the wind blows.This month it has  
 blown mostly North East which is very 
 odd for June.Three people have been   
 struck by lightning in the last year. 
 The Vicar's wife was and someone else 
 was struck twice the same day.  We    
 live below the Malvern Hills so if it 
 is nice on the Hills it is not very   
 nice here and the other way around.   
 Sometimes it will not make up its mind
 to rain or be sunny.  I don't like it 
 cold or when it will not make its mind
 up.  I like warm weather and not      
 winter because in the snow things we  
 make fall down or are pushed down by  
 other people watching.  We think the  
 reason we get odd weather is because  
 we are on a plain below the Malvern   
 Hills.                                </content>
