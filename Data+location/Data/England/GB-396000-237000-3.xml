		<content>   Not very many years ago most of the 
 inhabitants of{Conderton}were employed
 on the land, either in agriculture or 
 market gardening. Mechanisation has   
 now reduced that number to just 6     
 families, with the remainder commuting
 to the nearby towns, or enjoying their
 retirement. In the village there is a 
 family run garage, a public house and 
 a light engineering company, together 
 with a professional model engineer    
 who, among his many models, has       
 produced a fully working fairground   
 organ.                                
   The engineering company produces a  
 variety of small springs for the      
 electronics and automotive industries 
 and springs from this factory are used
 in the Concord aeroplane thus         
 illustrating how a village community  
 can adapt to the modern world and it's
 changing demands.                     </content>
