 4_8 years.On average the school takes 
 in 6 new pupils a year.If the children

 probably arrive by car.Most children  
 from{Shilton}walk.The numbers of      
 children going to the school have not 
 increased over the years.             
   There are two full-time teachers    
 including the headmaster.Also, one    
 lady comes in one day a week.         
   The headmaster,{Mr. Holmes},has been
 in the school for 14 years.He is a    
 full-time teacher as well as a        
 caretaker.What he{enjoys}about the job
 is watching the children develop and  
 succeed, but he{dislikes}the constant 
 interruptions when he is teaching,like
 telephone calls.
