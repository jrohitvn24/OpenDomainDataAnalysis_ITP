		<title>15Hilliers At Newmarket.</title>
		<content>   Hilliers has been in existence since
 1819.In the olden days pigs were      
 brought from Ireland and Wales to     
 England, where they were driven along 
 the A4 from Bristol to London.        
   Often, pigs would be sold to people 
 on the way. These people would send   
 them to Hilliers where they were      
 killed, boned, salted, cured, dried,  
 smoked and made into bacon.Until      
 recently pigs were reared in this     
 vallley.In 1980 they stopped killing  
 pigs at this factory.                 
   Hilliers was amalgamated with       
 another factory called Sovereign Foods
 in the West Midlands.There are 3      
 factories, one for pies and pasties,  
 one for sausages and one for meats.   
 The first two factories are in        
 Newmarket and the other one is in the 
 West Midlands.
