		<content> Most of this block of land has been   
 aquired by the Ministry of Defence and
 used for army training purposes. It is
 commonly and locally known as the     
 "Battle Area". There is no public     
 access to genersl public although a   
 pass can be obtained by people living 
 at West Tofts and not connected with  
 the military. The soil is light and   
 sandy with  any stones and flints and 
 small areas of boggy grounds, and is  
 generally uncultivated. There is a    
 fair abundance of wildlife            
 particularly near the mere and        
 waterways. Unrestricted rough grazing 
 by sheep is let to the highest tender 
 (not a local farmer). Human habitation
 is sparse although on the battle area 
 there remains the ruins of cottages.
