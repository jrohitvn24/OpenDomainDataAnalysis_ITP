The busiest time in the Crown Hotel is 
the mid summer. The hotel can take as  
many as twenty nine guests. There are  
seventeen bedrooms. Many German,       
French,Italian and Americans stay      
there. The hotel employs eighteen full 
time staff and two part time workers.  
The guests' favourite meal is roast    
beef, Yorkshire pudding and roast      
potatoes, with chocolate hazelnut      
meringue to follow. In March a new roof
was put on the hotel and more bedrooms 
are to have private bathrooms. The     
hotel was first built as a lodging for 
Mary Tudor's knights when she visited  
Framlingham Castle in 1554. The main   
entrance used to be the carriage       
entrance to the stables. The hotel has 
three ghosts. It is a three star hotel.
