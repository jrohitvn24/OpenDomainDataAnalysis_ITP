		<content> The area of Rod Moor is covered mainly
 by moorland with patches of woodland  
 and several grazing fields.The area   
 is not very heavily populated the only
 village being Dungworth.              
                                       
 People live in isolated farms or      
 clusters of farms, or in recently     
 renovated elderly estate              
 buildings.There is no uniform style of
 building,other than that they are     
 stone walled and slate rooved.        
 Rod Moor is generally used for sheep  
 and dairy farming though there are    
 several other farming types on        
 arable land. A large sector of the    
 moor is privately owned this making   
 access difficult,sometimes impossible.
 Rod Moor is very bleak with heather,  
 grass and occasional outcrops of rock.
