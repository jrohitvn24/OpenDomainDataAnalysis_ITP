		<title>18INDUSTRY IN MICHAELCHURCH</title>
		<content> Around the area of Michaelchurch there
 is very little industry. Farming tends
 to be the major employer of labour.   
 Cattle sheep and other livestock are  
 reared for their meat and other items 
 such as milk and eggs are sold at     
 market.                               
 Local mployers include builders       
 retailers who sell items from the post
 office or from the garages.           
 There are car breakers near to the    
 study area. Forestry is another       
 employer in the area.                 
 All of these are small local          
 industries who employ only a small    
 number of people.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
