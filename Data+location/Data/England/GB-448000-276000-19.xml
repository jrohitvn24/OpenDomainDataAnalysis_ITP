		<title>19Domesday Report</title>
		<content> On Monday morning we had just started 
 to do our domesday project. In the    
 morning we watched a programme called{
{Domesday project.}On Monday afternoon 
 we went for a 6 mile walk. We went to 
 the bottom half of our D block and two
 other girls are helping us. When we   
 went for a walk I went with Marie     
 Pitt.We went through many puddles     
 which I did not like. On Tuesday we   
 went to Brownsover. On Wednesday we   
 went to Lower Lodge Farm and passed   
 Brownsover Hall. Marie and I thought  
 it was spooky. We sat on the gate and 
 looked at the horses for 5 or 10      
 minutes and set off back to school.I  
 think the domesday project is good.   
 Marie and myself went to do a report  
 on housing. We managed to get 6 people
 to answer our questions.
