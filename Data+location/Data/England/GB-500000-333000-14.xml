		<content> The western boundary of the parish of 
 Braceby and Sapperton runs along Long 
 Hollow, on the line of Roman road     
 linking Bourne with Ancaster. South   
 west of Sapperton village a{Roman     
 settlement has been under excavation  
 since 1974. By their names, Sapperton 
 is{Saxon}in origin and Braceby is     
{Danish.}For more than 700 years from  
 the time of Domesday 1085 the two     
 villages formed part of the Soke of   
 Grantham. Both villages have churches 
 dating from around the{13th century;  
 the Manor House at Sapperton and the  
 three farmhhouses at Braceby all date 
 from around the{17th century.}The     
 middle of the{20th century}saw the    
 villages in steady decline, as the    
 population moved away and houses were 
 left empty. Since the early 1970's    
 this decline has been reversed, with  
 many houses having been modernised.   </content>
