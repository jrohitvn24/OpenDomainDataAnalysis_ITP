		<title>16NARROW GUAGE RAILWAY L. B.</title>
		<content> Originally built to carry sand from   
 the sand quarries to the main line    
 station. The little two foot guage    
 railway winds its way through uniquely
 varied surroundings from the terminus 
 at Page's Park, past a sand quarry    
 trough new housing estates and        
 industrial areas to open countryside, 
 at one point travelling up a 1:24     
 gradient. The return trip takes 1 hour
 10 mins and covers 5.5 miles.         
  A passenger service commenced in 1967
 when enthusiasts realising its        
 historical importance and potential   
 formed a society to protect itb and   
 provide a public service. The track   
 has been rebuilt and coaches,         
 stations, and engine sheds have been  
 built. Signals and safety equipment   
 have been installed and a collection  
 of unique steam and diesel locomotives
 has been built up.                    </content>
