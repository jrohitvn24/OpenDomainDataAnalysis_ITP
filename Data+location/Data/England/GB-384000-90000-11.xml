		<content> The majority of the buildings in the  
 area are agricultural, farm houses,   
 barns, outbuildings and one granary,  
 dating originally from l7th and l8th  
 centuries but with various alterations
 and additions. They are generally     
 brick built with tiles roofs, but some
 cob walls remain. A few traditional   
 cob and thatch cottages survive, one  
 noticeably at Chapel Cross. Culeaze   
 Farmhouse is an attractive, sizeable  
 dwelling, dating from l7l5, and is now
 a mixture of cob and brick with a     
 slate roof. Some more recently built  
 houses, occupied mainly by retired    
 persons, and some modern bungalows are
 grouped near the Golf Club, with its  
 modern Club House, close to small     
 industries and in an isolated area    
 down a rough track. Bere Lodge, Hyde, 
 is an unusual octagonal dwelling on   
 the edge of Wareham Forest.           </content>
