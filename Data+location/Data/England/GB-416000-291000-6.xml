 THE 2ND LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY, VERY  
 MECHANISED AND AUTOMATED. SEWAGE FROM 
 ALL THE MIDLANDS IS TREATED AND THE   
 RECLAIMED WATER RETURNED TO THE       
 RIVERS. THE RESIDUE IS DEALT WITH AT  
 THE SLUDGE DISPOSAL PLANT, FINALLY ALL
 THAT REMAINS IS ASH. HAMS HALL POWER  
 STATION IS IN THE AREA BUT NOW PART IS
 SHUT DOWN AND THREE COOLING TOWERS    
 DEMOLISHED. MOST PAST EMPLOYMENT FOR  
 CURDWORTH PEOPLE WAS THE SEWAGE WORKS,
 NOW, AS IN WATER ORTON, THEY TRAVEL TO
 THE NEARBY TOWNS AND CONURBATION FOR  
 EMPLOYMENT. A SMALL TRADING ESTATE AT 
 BOTH VILLAGES, SHOPS, HOSTELRIES AND  
 FARMS PROVIDE SOME JOBS. AT CURDWORTH
