		<title>02NEWTOWN SETTLEMENT PATTERN</title>
		<content> The population of this area, estimated
 at 1,400, is very scattered, but there
 is the village of Newtown and part of 
 North Boarhunt. There are remnants of 
 settlements  at Hoegate, World's End, 
 Hipley and Southend. Newtown, formerly
 part of Soberton, became in 1850 a    
 separate ecclesiastical parish. Land  
 for the building of the church,school 
 and glebe house was given by the      
 Rookesbury Estate.                    
 The age of the houses varies from 16th
 and 17th century farmhouses to modern.
 The majority of post 1960's housing   
 has been infilling or replacement of  
 an older property although many are   
 modernised and enlarged. There are no 
 private housing estates and only one  
 block of 14 council build houses at   
 N. Boarhunt, some having been sold to 
 the occupants. There are several      
 mobile homes.                         </content>
