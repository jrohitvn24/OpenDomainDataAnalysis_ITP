		<title>20The Miners Strike 1984/85</title>
		<content>  During the strike my dad went golfing
 with two of his friends.After the game
 he went to Broomhill to dig for       
 coal.He took a pick,riddle and some   
 bags.He took the pick to dig a hole to
 get the coal.The riddle was to sift   
 the rubbish out.He did plenty of      
 gardening for some food.He planted    
 beans,cabbage,carrots and onions.

  In the strike my dad was angry       
 because he was not getting any strike 
 pay.All his money was being paid to   
 the pickets.Every Sunday we went to my
 dad's mum for dinner.Before we went   
 home my grandad always gave my dad    
 some money.My dad did not go out.I    
 tried to stop my dad from smoking.My  
 guitar teacher let me have some free  
 lessons.
