		<content> In 1836 a fund was set up to start a  
{National Day School}in Sharnbrook; a  
 year later a room, which is still     
 used by the school, was let to the    
 committee by Admiral Gambier.  In 1868
{Goverment inspectors}began to take an 
 interest in the school, and in 1870   
 the{School Board}was set up, more     
 land bought, and a master's house and 
 new school were built.  This was the  
 first county school to be set up in   
 Bedfordshire. New buildings were added
 to{'John Gibbard School'}in 1968 and  
 1975.  Today there are five classes, a
 staffroom, a hall, a library, a       
 nature reserve and a resources room.  
 There are 115 children in the school, 
 and 50 of them have{school dinners.   
 The children, aged 5-9,transfer to    
{Margaret Beaufort School,Riseley,}in  
 the September following their 9th.    
 birthday.                             </content>
