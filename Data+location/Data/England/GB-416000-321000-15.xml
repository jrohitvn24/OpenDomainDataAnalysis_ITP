		<content>   I think most families in this area  
 have a{car,}as the nearest town is at 
 least seven miles away. There is      
{public transport}available but this is
 very limited.                         
  {East Staffs District Council}provide
 a bus service which travels through   
 Rangemore village at 7.55 a.m. going  
 to Tatenhill, and then to Burton. It  
 makes the return journey in the late  
 afternoon, arriving in Rangemore at   
 5.02 p.m. Not many people use it      
 regularly but a survey made by the    
 schoolchildren revealed that it was   
 needed by a few. The remainder go to  
 work by car.                          
   On Thursdays and Saturdays it is    
 Market Day in Burton.{Stevensons of   
{Uttoxeter}provide a bus which travels 
 through several villages, stopping in 
 Rangemore at 10.45 a.m. and returning 
 from Burton at 1.30 p.m.              </content>
