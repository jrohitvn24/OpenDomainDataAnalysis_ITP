		<title>11About Horses, Stebbing</title>
		<content> There is a riding school in Stebbing, 
 which is very popular.There are       
 thirteen ponies and horses.           
      You can have lessons every       
 weekend.Five people help there.About  
 thirty people go to the stables.      
      They have different breeds which 
 include a thoroughbred.There isn't any
 limit to females,but men aren't       
 allowed.There are usually five lessons
 a week.                               
      We have a Blacksmith who comes   
 to the village,he has a forge in one  
 of the farms,so people take their     
 horses there to be shod.He also has a 
 portable forge which he carries around
 in the back of his van so he goes to  
 peoples horses as well.
