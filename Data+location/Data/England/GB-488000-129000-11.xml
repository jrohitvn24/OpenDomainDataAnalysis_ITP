		<content>     Valewood Farm House is no longer a
 farm, the majority of the land being  
 sold off in 1983 to Lord Wise. The    
 house is a timber framed hall house,  
 dating back to Elizabethan times.In   
 the garden are seven springs which    
 form the head waters of the River Wey.
    Valewood House was built in the    
 seventeenth century. In 1830 an Irish 
 man called Logan turned the building  
 into a mansion, with pleasure gardens.
 The grounds occupy ten and a half     
 acres, with a lake covering five and a
 half acres.Half an acre has been used 
 to make a secret garden. Among other  
 well known owners was James Mangles,  
 the diarist. The house is now used as 
 a Nursing Home.                       
    Lowder Mill was powered by water   
 gained from artificial ponds. It is an
 18th century building of stone and    
 brick. It is now a private residence. </content>
