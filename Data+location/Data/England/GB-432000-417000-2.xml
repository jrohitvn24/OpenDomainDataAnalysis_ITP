		<title>02Thornes Park, Wakefield</title>
		<content> Thornes Park is the main park for the 
 City of Wakefield. It is used by all  
 types of people to walk dogs, feed    
 ducks, admire flowers and use the     
 sports facilities. There are 6 tennis 
 courts, a putting green, a pitch and  
 putt course, football and rugby       
 pitches, cricket squares, bowling     
 greens, running tracks and adventure  
 playground. Probably the biggest      
 attraction is the pond. It is quite   
 big and full of life. There is an     
 island in the centre of the pond where
 ducks lay their eggs. Near the pond is
 a bird aviary. A fair comes to the    
 park every 6 months and various city  
 events are held there. These have     
 included Sport For All events and an  
 Ideal Homes exhibition. Most people   
 seem to like the park for its open    
 spaces and facilities.
