		<title>11Hobbies</title>
		<content> We asked people about their           
 hobbies.The most popular one was      
 gardening,but there were many others  
 mentioned.These were: weaving,        
 spinning, sailing, rugby, cycling,    
 sewing,reading,knitting,swimming and  
 walking.                              
 Some people said they did not have    
 time for any hobbies.Nobody put down  
 watching television as a hobby but    
 most people said they had a television
 set so we assume they sometimes watch 
 it.Some people also have video        
 machines.We think the hobbies are     
 about the same here as anywhere else  
 in the country.                       
 One sport is fairly unique in the West
 country and that is skittles. Most    
 public houses have a skittle alley    
 where the game is played with wooden  
 balls and nine pins. League matches   
 are played between rival teams.       </content>
