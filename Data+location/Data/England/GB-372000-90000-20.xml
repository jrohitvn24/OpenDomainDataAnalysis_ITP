		<content>{ 19:}This old SCOTS PINE, with its    
 distinctive orange trunk, has produced
 the young trees nearby. The SCOTS is  
 Britain's only native Pine and can be 
 compared with the MONTEREY PINES'     
 dark, deeply fissured trunks.         
{ 20:}LAUREL is not a native shrub,    
 being similar to RHODODENDRON in      
 appearance, but with small white      
 spikes of flowers and black fruits. On
 the left is a line of WESTERN RED     
 CEDAR.                                
{ 21:}ASH regenerates well from wind   
 dispearsed seeds where there is       
 sufficient light. It has been         
 underplanted here with shade-tolerant 
 WESTERN HEMLOCKS.                     
{ 22:}Many WOODLAND FLOWERS can be seen
 along this path and SPECKLED WOOD     
 BUTTERFLIES occur in Summer. The slope
 down to the car park was cleared in   
 1968.                                 </content>
