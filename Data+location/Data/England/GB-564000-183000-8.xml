		<content> Our school football team has had a    
 very successful season.  We won the   
 league as we did last year.  We lost  
 one game in the league, but were      
 knocked out of the Sam David Cup by   
 the eventual winners in the           
 semi-final. We were presented with our
 medals at Grays Athletic F.C. after   
 beating a rest of the league team 1-0.
 We won a five a side tournament at    
 Orset Village Fair.  The school       
 netball team played many friendly     
 games during the season.  In athletics
 we won the competion for small        
 schools.  We were second in the field 
 events.  Richard Illing won the high  
 jump, Daniel Murray won the ball      
 throwing and Lucy Saunders was 2nd in 
 the long jump.  The boys relay team   
 was first. 18 children took part in a 
 county dancing festival.
