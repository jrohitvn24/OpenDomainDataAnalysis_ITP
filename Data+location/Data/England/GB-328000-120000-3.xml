		<title>03BROWNIES AND CUBS</title>
		<content>   The Brownies and Cubs are girls and 
 boys who meet on special days and who 
 wear uniforms.                        
   Brownies meet on Mondays from 18.00 
 to 19.30. Sometimes they go on pack   
 holidays but only once a year. When   
 you get to Brownies in the evening,   
 you sing the Brownies song. Sometimes 
 you have a sing_song. Then you play   
 games like "Baked Beans" and "Fishes  
 in the Net". Rounders is one of the   
 Brownies' well liked team games.      
   Cubs meet on Thursdays from 18.30 to
 20.00. They meet in North Curry       
 village hall. The minimum age for     
 joining Brownies and Cubs is 7 years. 
 You leave Brownies at the age of 10   
 and Cubs at the age of 11. Then you   
 can go on to join the Guides or the   
 Scouts.
