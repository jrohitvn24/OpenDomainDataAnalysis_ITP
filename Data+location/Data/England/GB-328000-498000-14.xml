		<content>    One{bus}per day goes from Coniston 
 along the A593 via{Skelwith Bridge}to 
{Ambleside.}The only other service     
 provided is for children attending the
 primary and secondary schools in      
{Coniston,}who are taken to school in  
 two{minibuses}operated by the local   
 garage. Transport for those without   
 vehicles can also be provided by a    
 voluntary service centred on Coniston.
 In this area, the{motor vehicle}reigns
 supreme (especially if it has four    
 wheel drive !)                        
    People in the area had the facility
 of{rail}transport from Coniston until 
 the closure of the line in 1958. The  
 closure is increasingly regarded as a 
 grave error, not least because the    
 railway would have developed as an    
 important tourist attraction as well  
 as a means of diverting traffic from  
 crowded roads in summer.              </content>
