		<content>   From a very small village in the c12
 with a few houses around the church,  
 Cheddleton has grown and now has a    
 population of around 6500. Two housing
 estates were built soon after W.W.1,  
 but most of the expansion has occured 
 during the last 20 years and more     
 houses are scheduled to be built next 
 year. In Victorian times there would  
 not have been more than a few hundred 
 residents. The population of          
 St.Edwards Hospital has decreased.    
 There have been as many as 1500       
 patients - now in the region of 650.  
 Most of the people work in the pottery
 towns or in nearby Leek or Cheadle.
