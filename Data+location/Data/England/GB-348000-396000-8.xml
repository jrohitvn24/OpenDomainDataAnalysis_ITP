		<content>   Much has changed in this area in the
 40 years since{1945.}Large estates of 
 both private and council housing have 
 covered much{farm_land.}Many{hedgerows
 have disappeared leaving large open   
 fields.The air is much{cleaner}because
 many houses have{central_heating}and  
 smoke control has eliminated{smogs.}  
 Much of our shopping is done in{      
{supermarkets}where you serve yourself 
 but in some local shops you are still 
 served.{40 years}ago{transport}was    
 different.To get to St.Helens people  
 walked or used the trolley_bus or tram
 while today nearly everyone has a car.
 There are large areas used{car_parks. 
 We still have buses in this area but  
 are mainly used by elderly or school  
 children.Many people still work in    
 Glass,Coal and Pharmaceuticals but    
 also many woman work and many people  
 travel to Liverpool or Manchester.    </content>
