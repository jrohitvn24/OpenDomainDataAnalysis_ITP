		<content>   The favourite game for both boys and
 girls is "Bulldogs".To play Bulldogs  
 someone is "IT" and the others have to
 run across the playground without     
 being touched by the person who is    
 "IT".They run when "IT" shouts        
 "Bulldogs".If they are touched by the 
 "IT" then they have to help the person
 who is "IT".Whoever is first caught is
 "IT" in the next game .This is a      
 dangerous game and there have been    
 many incidents when children have been
 hurt,so it is banned by most teachers.
   Among older children ball games are 
 usually played during "breaks" or at  
 lunch time. These include Football,   
 Non-stop Cricket, Rounders and Tennis 
 played with the hands. Young children 
 prefer Hop-Scotch, "IT on the line",  
 Piggy-in-the-Middle and chasing games.
   Girls prefer to play Elastic        
 Skipping .                            </content>
