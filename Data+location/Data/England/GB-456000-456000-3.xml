		<content>     British Bull Dogs is a game that  
 the boys play in the playground. The  
 rules are as follows.                 
       Someone is picked to try to     
       catch the people who run        
       across the playground.Those     
       that are caught help to catch   
       others and so on. The person    
       who is left is the winner.      
     The game is exciting and fast     
 because you have to run very          
 quickly to beat the person in the     
 middle.                               
     The girls like playing Elastics.  
 Two children stand about 2 metres     
 apart with the elastic stretched      
 around their ankles. Another child has
 to jump in and out without tripping up
 if that is successful the elastic is  
 moved up the body to the knees and so 
 on. It gets much harder the higher the
 elastic goes.                         </content>
