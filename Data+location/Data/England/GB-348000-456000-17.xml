		<title>17A lecturer living at Univ.</title>
		<content> I get up around 8 am.  For breakfast I
 have two Weetabix and a cup of coffee.
  I work in the History Department at  
 the university and teach about 55     
 students.  For recreation and some    
 shopping I stay in the university.  I 
 do not go to church but for medical   
 treatment I go to the University      
 Health Centre.  When I do have to go  
 out of the university I go by bus or  
 get a lift in a car.  In my spare time
 I read, go to the cinema or theatre,  
 sometimes I listen to music or jog    
 around the university.  My flat       
 consists of 3 rooms, a lounge with a  
 small kitchen, 1 bedroom and bathroom.
 All my rooms are furnished.  Sometimes
 when the students have end of term    
 parties it is noisy but mostly it is  
 quiet.  I cook for myself or eat in a 
 cafeteria here.  I live here because  
 it is convenient for my work.         </content>
