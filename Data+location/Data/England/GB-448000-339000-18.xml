		<content> BULLDOG.                              
 Bulldog is a game which anyone        
 can play.You need to be fast and      
 dodgy.One person goes at the top of   
 the field and the rest go down to the 
 bottom.The person who is "on" shouts  
 "BULLDOG" and they all run up the top 
 and dodge past the person who is      
 "on".If he/she dobs you,you are "on"  
 with him/her.You keep doing this until
 all have been dobbed.                 
 WHAT'S THE TIME MR WOLF?              
 At the start you pick a person to be  
 the wolf.You have as many players as  
 you want.The players say"WHAT'S THE   
 TIME MR WOLF?" and the wolf says,1    
 o'clock,2 o'clock,3 o'clock and so    
 on.When the wolf says dinner time the 
 wolf chases the players and when the  
 wolf catches you,you become the wolf.
