		<title>08        THE DUCKS</title>
		<content>   One of the main features of the     
 beautiful{River Wansbeck}is the colony
 of mallards which dabble in its       
 waters.They are part of our{heritage  
 and responsible citizens remain       
 fiercely protective towards them.     
   They must have been as unperturbed  
 by{stage_coaches}rattling over the    
 bridge as they are by{low flying jets 
 which now skim our valley.They have   
 ridden out fearsome{floods,}and many  
 generous hands help them through a    
 hard winter.                          
   Increasing{vandalism}of eggs,and    
 decreasing nesting sites due to       
 housing development drive many nesting
 ducks high up the quiet reaches of the
 river to share the haunts of{otter}and
{kingfisher.}                          
   Their proud return,ducklings in tow,
 restores their numbers to around five 
 hundred - and our faith in the future.</content>
