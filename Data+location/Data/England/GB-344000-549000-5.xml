		<content> I go to a small school.It only has 37 
 people in it.You start when you are   
 four years old.Some very little       
 children come on Thursday             
 afternoons.Our school has two classes 
 and three teachers.It has two dinner  
 ladies .One is called Mrs Reed and the
 other is called Mrs Fullerton.We say  
 prayers before we eat our lunch.We    
 have nice school dinners and sometimes
 we have ice_cream and hot chocolate.  
 We do cycling tests in the yard.In    
 the small class you start at four     
 years old to seven.Then you start in  
 the other class from seven years old  
 till eleven.Then you go to secondary  
 school.Our school is small compared to
 my  other school in Kenya.In Kenya our
 school had 500 pupils in it and 30    
 teachers and 20 workers.
