In the home there are quite a few      
Entertainments like listening to the   
radio, computers if you have one,and   
video games ,TV and lots of other      
things.Some people go to places further
away like Derngate Centre and the      
A.B.C. cinema in Northampton.Some      
people like to vist Wickstead Park and 
zoo's and other places.In the village  
we have several organisations. These   
are; Youth club, Gymnastics for the    
younger ones,Bingo for the elderlies,  
cubs,scouts,Boys Brigade,Girls Brigade,
Brownies,Girl Guides and Rangers.We    
have a  Playing field with swings,a    
slide,a climbing frame,monkey bars ,and
two barrels.A lot of teenagers just    
wander around the village or go to town
because they have nothing to do.
