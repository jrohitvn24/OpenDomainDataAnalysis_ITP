		<title>07LAW &amp; ORDER-OUTWOOD AREA</title>
		<content> THIS IS A FAIRLY LAW-ABIDING AREA WHEN
 COMPARED WITH SOME,ESPECIALLY CITY    
 CENTRES.NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE MATTERS
 WHICH GIVE CAUSE FOR CONCERN AS       
 FOLLOWS;{VANDALISM}-MINDLESS AND      
 POINTLESS DAMAGE CAUSED TO            
 PROPERTY,ESPECIALLY SCHOOLS,BY A SMALL
 MINORITY OF TEENAGERS,WHO SMASH       
 WINDOWS,DESTROY EQUIPMENT,BREAK INTO  
 BUILDING AND STEAL CASH OR SALEABLE   
 ARTICLES.MANY PEOPLE FEEL THAT COURTS 
 ARE TOO LENIENT WITH OFFENDERS.{      
{HOUSEBREAKING}AND{PETTY THEFT}HAS     
 BECOME FAR MORE COMMON AND OFTEN GOES 
 UNDETECTED.PARKING AND CYCLING ON THE 
 PAVEMENT-BOTH ARE AGAINST THE LAW,BUT 
 LITTLE IS DONE TO STOP IT.THIS AFFECTS
 PEDESTRIANS AND BLIND FOLK.DISCIPLINE 
 IN SCHOOLS IS GENERALLY GOOD BUT THERE
 IS A SMALL DISRUPTIVE ELEMENT AMONG   
 TEENAGE PUPILS WHO ARE NOT USED TO    
 DISCIPLINE IN THE HOME.               </content>
