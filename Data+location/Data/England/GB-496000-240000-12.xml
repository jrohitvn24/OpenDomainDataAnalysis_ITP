		<content> The Brick industry can be traced back 
 to the 17th century with reference in 
 parish registers to bricklayers.The   
 present industry began in the 19th    
 century with references to a          
 Brickfield and kiln at Caulcott and   
 Marston in 1881.                      
 The Marston Valley Brick Company      
 became established at the end of the  
 last century and was taken over by the
 London Brick Company.Clay extraction  
 began in the Brogborough 2 pit after  
 the 2nd World War to serve the        
 Ridgmont Brickworks.The pit is 270    
 acres in area and a major scar on the 
 landscape.It is being filled from     
 south to north with domestic          
 waste.Eventually the restored land may
 be capable of agricultural use.
