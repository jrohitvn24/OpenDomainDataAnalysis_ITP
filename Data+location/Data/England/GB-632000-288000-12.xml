		<title>12SCHOOLS IN THE BUNGAY AREA</title>
		<content>There are five first schools, Flixton, 
Ditchingham,Bungay,St.Edmunds and      
Earsham.All these aim to create a happy
atmosphere.Children can take part in   
extra-curricular activities as well    
as basic subjects. At St. Edmunds, the 
older children learn French.           
At nine, ten or eleven children can go 
to Bungay Middle School. Here there is 
the full range of subjects available,  
mostly class-teacher taught in the     
lower years and fully specialist taught
by the fourth year. We feel that this  
is a lively, happy place and that our  
needs are thought of.                  
At thirteen, most children transfer to 
Bungay High School. After the first    
year here, they follow mainly exam     
subjects. Pupils from 34 villages and  
 two small towns go to this school.    
There are sixth form facilities there.
