		<content> We surveyed the children in school to 
 get some ideas about{homelife}as we   
 decided that this would be the best   
 way.{Food}is very important and most  
 families eat together  at least once a
 day.A lot of the{food}is convenience  
{food}such as frozen and tinned,       
 although a lot of people have the     
 chance to keep chickens and grow      
 vegetables in their gardens.People    
 keep dogs to protect their houses as  
 well as  burglar alarms for{safety.   
 A lot of old people keep{pets}for     
 company like cats,dogs,fish,mice and  
 hamsters.When we surveyed the school  
 we found that every one had at least  
 one television in their home.Not as   
 many people have videos and everyone  
 had a radio in their home and everyone
 had a cassette player.The main music  
 that people listened to was pop music 
 and watched soap operas on television.</content>
