		<title>05Upper Chancton Farm</title>
		<content>  Upper Chancton Farm comprises approx.
 410 acres and is given over mainly to 
 arable production ( wheat and barley) 
 with grass grazing for a herd of 106  
 beef cattle.                          
    The farm has been run for the past 
 two years solely by{Mr John Eeles}and 
 his two sons{Stephen}and{David.}The   
 farmhouse, now divided into two for   
{Stephen}and{David's}families, dates   
 back to 1721.{John}and his wife live  
 close-by in a converted barn.         
    The busiest time of the year is    
 between July and October when         
 harvesting and sowing for the         
 following year takes place.           
    As well as the beef cattle there   
 are 5 horses, 20 'free range' chickens
 and 7 dogs. The beef cattle provide a 
 major source of income with new stock 
 being bought in from markets at       
 Hereford,Guildford and Haywards Heath.</content>
