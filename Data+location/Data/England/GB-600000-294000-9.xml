 WE TALKED TO A PENSIONER IN THE       
 VILLAGE ABOUT WHAT A VILLAGE WAS LIKE 
 IN THE EARLY 1900'S.                  
 IN THE 1930'S{CARS}WERE JUST BECOMING 
 POPULAR.                              
      FARMS WERE JUST USING{TRACTORS   
  INSTEAD OF HORSES,AND HORSES WERE    
 QUITE UNPOPULAR.                      
          IN FACT,THERE ARE{MORE}HORSES
 AROUND IN 1985,THAN THERE WERE IN THE 
 1930'S. HORSES ARE NOW USED FOR       
 PLEASURE INSTEAD OF WORK.             
{                                      
{RADIO'S}WERE JUST INVENTED IN         
 THE EARLY 1900'S,AND THE FIRST RADIO  
 WAS CALLED THE{"CATS WHISKER".}AT     
 THESE TIMES TO LISTEN TO THE RADIO YOU
 HAD TO WEAR HEADPHONES.               
                                       
 BREAD WAS DELIVERED TO THE DIFFERENT  
 HOUSES,AND THERE WERE A LOT MORE PUBS.</content>
