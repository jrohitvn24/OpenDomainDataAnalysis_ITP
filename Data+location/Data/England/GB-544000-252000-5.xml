		<title>05Survey of Trumpington</title>
		<content>   The first survey that we did was    
 near the town church. We asked a lady 
 her general opinion about enter-      
 tainment, she wanted more for         
 teenagers and also more nightclubs.   
                                       
   Most of her shopping was done in    
 Cambridge. She was about 30 years old,
 and her hobbies were Badmington and   
 she often went to the Cambridge{Sports
{Centre}(The Kelsey Kerridge.)         
                                       
    The next two were also women, and  
 agreed on the same ideas. They also   
 wanted a more effecient bus service.  
 One was a barmaid and the other was a 
 housewife.                            
                                       
    The last person questioned was a   
 man who was in his seventies said he  
 enjoyed being alive.
