		<title>11FUND RAISING AYLESTONE HIGH</title>
		<content>    Over two hundred runners took part 
 in the Half Marathon and Fun Run      
 organised by Aylestone High School in 
 aid of the Bradford football ground   
 disaster, on the evening of 10.7.85.  
 They expected to raise over Â£3,000.   
    Hereford United Football Club      
 manager Mr. John Newman started the   
 races and presented the awards to the 
 winners.  Stewart Little came first in
 the Half Marathon and Trevor Thomas in
 the Fun Run.                          
    The whole event was computerised to
 provide each competitor with a        
 certificate giving their finishing    
 position and time for the race.       
    The organisers all agreed that the 
 event was highly successful and hoped 
 that the evening would be repeated    
 annually.
