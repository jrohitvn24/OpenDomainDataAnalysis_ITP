 2 men 1 employs 1 and 2 do not employ 
 anyone.Winter and spring barley       
 turnips swedes silage and hay are     
 grown for fodder. Some potatoes are   
 grown on rotation. Milburn village is 
 188 feet above sea level rising to 800
 feet plus this high land is moorland  
 and is used for sheep grazing. Twice a
 year there is a sheep gathering into  
 pens and sorted out for clipping and  
 dipping. Because of the nature of the 
 land it is most suited to grazing     
 rather than arable crops.             </content>
