		<content> My name is Adam Dowding and I am ten. 
 I got up at 7.45 a.m. and had cereal, 
 toast and apple juice.  After dressing
 in T-shirt, jeans, sweater and        
 training shoes, my Dad took me to     
 Minchinhampton School by car.  I went 
 into assembly and then I went upstairs
 to do graphs.  During play-time I ate 
 crisps and afterwards I wrote a story 
 about dinosaurs in Cheltenham.  For   
 lunch I had meat sandwiches, chocolate
 biscuits and flap-jack and I watched  
 tadpoles in the pond.  Then I drew a  
 map of France and read an adventure   
 book.  I went home at 3.15 p.m. and   
 watched tennis on television with my  
 Dad.  Later I played tennis with a    
 friend then, after I had watched more 
 television, I put on my red pyjamas,  
 had a cup of tea and went to sleep.
