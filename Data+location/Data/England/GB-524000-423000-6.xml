		<title>06CLUBS IN KEYINGHAM AND AREAS</title>
		<content> There are many different clubs in this
 area, catering for young and old, most
 of these are organised and run on a   
 self funding volantary basis and      
 although very well supported by       
 everyone it is not uncommon to find   
 the same people having to do most of  
 the organising and work involved. Some
 examples of these clubs are:- Cubs,   
 Scouts, Brownies, Guides, Womens      
 Institutes (both at Keyingham and     
 Ottringham), Darby and Joan (for the  
 over 60's), Football Clubs, Youth     
 Clubs, Keep fit and Aerobics, Social  
 Groups, Mother and Toddler Group,     
 Playgroup, Brightour (run by the      
 Methodist Church).
