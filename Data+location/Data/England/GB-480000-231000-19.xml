		<title>19THICK BARE WOOD</title>
		<content> Just east of the road running out to  
 the Buckingham, Bletchley Road, there 
 is a small woodland called Thick Bare 
 Wood. This area is said to be just as 
 most of the land was like in older    
 days. 12 of us went along a muddy     
 track to get to the wood. When we got 
 to the wood we found it very difficult
 to get into the centre as the trees   
 were dense and the undergrowth was    
 thick. The trees were mostly          
 deciduous. We spotted sycamore, oak,  
 elder, hawthorn, hazel trees and      
 masses of honeysuckle. We saw a hare  
 running in the wood and it is well    
 known that in the middle of the wood  
 the small deer known locally as       
 "Barking Deer" have their home.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
