		<title>14HANDBELL RINGERS (cont.)</title>
		<content>                                       
 Nowadays, most of the team of ringers 
 are young girls. They have a leader,  
 and practise a few weeks before       
 Christmas.They work very hard on      
 Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and all  
 the Christmas season, and all the     
 visitors look forward to their        
 coming.Over the years they have raised
 thousands of pounds- last year alone  
 they raised over a thousand pounds.   
 Handbell ringing is a very interesting
 art; it takes a lot of skill to keep  
 the tune and rhythm going, and you    
 have to work very closely with the    
 rest of the team. The tradition has   
 continued for many years now, and last
 year the bells were re-toned. Many    
 girls from Elmslie School have been in
 the team, and I hope I will soon be   
 able to join them.
