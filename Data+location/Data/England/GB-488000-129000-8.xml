		<content>     There are several interesting     
 people who have lived or worked in the
 area which we have had to study.      
     Peter Davies is a well known bird 
 expert, author and broadcaster. He    
 lives on Marley Common.               
     Molly Hyde, the former England    
 Ladies Cricket Captain, is actively   
 involved in the work of the National  
 Trust in the area. She is President of
 the Blackdown committee.              
     The area is close to Haslemere    
 station, within an hour of Waterloo by
 fast train. This means that many      
 wealthy and influential commuters have
 chosen to make their homes in the     
 attractive setting.  They include     
 active and retired judges,            
 businessmen, stockbrokers,            
 Ambassadors and other notabilities.
