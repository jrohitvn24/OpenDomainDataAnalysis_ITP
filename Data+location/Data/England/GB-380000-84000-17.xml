		<title>17WINFRITH VILLAGE SCHOOL  2</title>
		<content> We have found the old log books of the
 school dating from January,1872 and   
 have discovered that some of our      
 activities are quite similar.Many     
 children still live on farms but no   
 longer have days away from school to  
 look after the animals and crops.There
 used to be more than twice as many    
 children on role a hundred years      
 ago.In 1852 the population of the     
 village was 1101,in 1952 it was       
 586.At present it is estimated to be  
 800.                                  
 We have many activities at the school 
 including Swimming Galas,Open and     
 Sports Days in the Summer.Many parents
 come into school to help us with      
 reading,the computer,music,craftwork  
 and football.We visit the theatre,    
 farms ,beaches and many other interest
 ing places.There is an active Parents 
 and Teachers association.             </content>
