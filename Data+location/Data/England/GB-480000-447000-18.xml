		<content>{Q. How have the education cuts        
{affected Woldgate?}                   
 A. Humberside Education Authority have
 been extremely careful and caring,    
 desperate not to impoverish schools in
 the county. They have put as much     
 money as possible into the schools but
 in doing so they have reduced the     
 amount of money available for outside 
 support services, like advisers in    
 particular subjects. We have not been 
 able to keep up with the rise in      
 inflation and we have had no allowance
 for this for several years. We have to
 buy more things with less money       
 really. As a result we're having to   
 buy fewer books, stationary, physical 
 education equipment, etc..
