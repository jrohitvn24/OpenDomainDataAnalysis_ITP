		<title>19THE VILLAGE OF OAKAMOOR</title>
		<content>Steep hills, which cause havoc in the  
snow, lead down to Oakamoor which      
nestles beside the River Churnet.The   
village has not grown much since the   
heyday of Bolton's Copper Works,with   
very little post-war housing,just a few
council houses and old people's        
bungalows, forestry commission houses  
and private houses.Some houses have    
been sold as holiday homes.The larger  
houses around Oakamoor belonged to the 
Bolton family.Moor Court,until recently
used as a woman's open prison is now   
owned privately and converted into     
flats.A prison building has become an  
Old People's Home and provides         
employment for some local people.      
 Lightoaks Hall is for sale by the last
of the Boltons living in the village.  
The Trinty Church,built in 1832 shares 
a vicar with the parishes of Alton and 
Freehay.The Free Church is very active </content>
