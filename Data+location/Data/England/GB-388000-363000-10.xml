		<title>10BOSLEY WOOD TREATMENT MILL</title>
		<content> In the  N.E. corner of our area there 
 is a wood flour mill. This was        
 originally a water powered corn mill  
 which in 1927 the Thompstone  family ,
 for economic  reasons turned into wood
 flour mill. Wood shaving  and sawdust 
 are ground and sifted into powder ,   
 then bagged and delivered to          
 industries making linoleum and        
 plastics . In 1936 the mill began     
 grinding mica imported from China and 
 Brazil  now coconut shells from Sri   
 Lanka and Mozambique and Guar from    
 Pakistan are ground and used in       
 industry. Wood treatment is the       
 largest source of employment in Bosley
 and employs 102 people . Of these     
 approximately 10 are local .The wood  
 flour plant is now  fully automatic   
 which has meant the loss of 20 jobs   
 however automation has increased the  
 importance of skilled engineers.      </content>
