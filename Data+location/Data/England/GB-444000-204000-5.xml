		<content> The block falls entirely within the   
 civil and ecclesiastical parish of    
 Cumnor. Until local government        
 reorganisation in 1974, the area was  
 in Berkshire and under the more       
 immediate administration of the       
 Abingdon Rural District Council. It is
 now in Oxfordshire and in the Vale of 
 White Horse District.                 
 Cumnor Parish Council carries out the 
 normal duties of a parish council eg. 
 provision of street lighting, control 
 of public open space. It meets        
 monthly. It is consulted by the Vale  
 of White Horse District Council which 
 is the planning authority for the     
 area, but cannot override decisions by
 that council.
