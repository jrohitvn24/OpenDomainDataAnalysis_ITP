		<title>09MR.FOTHERGILL'S SEEDS.</title>
		<content>There are 32 people working at         
Mr.Fothergill's seed packing factory.  
They have 7 packing machines, 2 are for
packing seeds in foil. They have a seed
store room,where a dehumidifier keeps  
the seeds fresh. Some seeds cost 1,000 
pounds per small bag. 7,400,000        
packets of seeds a year are filled and 
one person packs 17,000  a day. 500    
varieties of seeds are stocked. Their  
seeds come from Holland, America and   
Great Britain. As well as the home     
market, they send them to Malaysia,    
West Indies, Africa and America, all   
packed in foil to keep fresh. When the 
orders come in they try to send them   
out the same day. They make "starter   
kits" containing compost, gravel and   
seeds. By pushing the packs  under an  
electric bar they get rid of static    
electricity. They send out 15,000      
parcels a year by "Roadline".          </content>
