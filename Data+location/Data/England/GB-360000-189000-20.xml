 "We have a weekend off school on      
 Saturday and Sunday. On these two days
 we can do almost anything we want to. 
 During the day we could play "Space   
 Invaders" on the home computer or have
 a game of football outside in the     
 street with our friends. In the       
 evening we mostly watch television."

 "We start school at 8.55 a.m. During  
 registration we are set an English or 
 Maths exercise. Every day we do some  
 English and Maths work. We also have  
 P.E. and time to do project work. Some
 of us stay for school lunch, others   
 bring sandwiches. School finishes at  
 3.30 p.m."
