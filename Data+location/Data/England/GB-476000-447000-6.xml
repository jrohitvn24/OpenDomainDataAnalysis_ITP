 This is the way it is described on the
 Ordnance Survey Maps, in point of fact
 it is divided into 3 uses. The runway 
 which runs from S.E. to N.W. is being 
 used by Pocklington &amp; District Gliding
 Club who also have small portion of   
 land for a hanger and ops. office.    
 The greater part of the airfield has  
 reverted to its pre-war use,farming,  
 the crops being both grass &amp; root. The
 Farm House is still standing, it is   
 occupied by a taxi owner.             
 The rest of the airfield (old living  
 quarters &amp; hangers) are now an        
 industrial estate, housing,car        
 repairs,electrical-equipment &amp;        
 installers,Herbal &amp; Health Foods &amp;
