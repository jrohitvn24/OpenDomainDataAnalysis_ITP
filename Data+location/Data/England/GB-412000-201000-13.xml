		<title>13MR.MALLESON, ESTATE MANAGER.</title>
		<content>  {Mr. Malleson}is the estate manager  
 of the{Ernest Cook Trust}estate in    
 Fairford.   The trust is an           
 educational one run on the profits of 
 the agricultural estate.   Mr.        
 Malleson's job involves organising the
 workers on the estate and consequently
 his normal day is packed with meetings
 and visits.   The estate takes up a   
 large part of the 4km x 3km rectangle 
 that is our area of study.    Apart   
 from his job Mr. Malleson is involved 
 in the local community and he is a    
 churchwarden at the parish church.    
 Although his job is such that he does 
 not have a great deal of spare time,  
 when he can snatch a few hours he is a
 keen gardener.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
