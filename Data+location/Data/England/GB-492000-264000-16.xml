		<title>16SHOE INDUSTRY:UNEMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content>The shoe industry used to be the       
biggest employer in Irchester but now  
there are only two small factories     
where shoes are made. The last big     
factory which was employing 140 people 
a year ago is now closing down and only
has 8 people working there,and all of  
those are in the offices.The four km sq
covering the south-west of Rushden     
although built-up does not include any 
industrial estates.However we found 5  
shoe factories amongst the houses,     
remnants of the industry on which      
Rushden's early prosperity was based.  
The most popular job in Rushden is     
still the shoe trade followed by jobs  
in engineering and plastics.People will
take jobs anywhere in the surrounding  
area particulary on bus routes.By our  
calculations there is 10% unemployment 
in Rushden.There appears to be equal   
opportunities for women.               </content>
