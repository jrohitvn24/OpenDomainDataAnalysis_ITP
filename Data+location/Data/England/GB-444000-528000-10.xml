		<title>10ENTERTAINMENT,RED LION HOTEL</title>
		<content> The Red Lion is situated at the       
 junction of the Dalton road and the   
 A19. There are few houses in the      
 vicinity and the large car park       
 confirms that most customers have to  
 travel. Dalton Piercy, the nearest    
 village is almost a mile away. The    
 hotel is a large modern clean-looking 
 building. There are a number of bars  
 and a separate night club.            
 In the grounds of the Red Lion there  
 is a pond about 7 metres long and 5   
 metres wide. On the surrounding lawns 
 there are tables where you can drink  
 out of doors. There are also swings, a
 see-saw, and a climbing frame with a  
 slide, for the use of customers       
 children.
