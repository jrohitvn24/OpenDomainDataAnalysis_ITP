		<title>05Cycle Hire</title>
		<content> A wide range of cycles can be hired   
 from bases at Whitwell and Normanton. 
 The whole family can be accomodated   
 from six weeks old to grandparents.   
 Every type of cycle is available from 
 sports racers to tandems and tricycles
 and can be fitted with kiddie seats.  
 Each party is given a small map of the
 area showing tracks and routes from 2 
 to 25 miles (the perimeter of Rutland 
 Water).  For the more energetic       
 leaflets are also published by the    
 Leicester County Council describing   
 day rides in the area   along quiet   
 routes and lanes of the surrounding   
 countryside and villages.             
 On fine weekends and summer days many 
 people park their cars, hire a cycle  
 and enjoy the fresh air and beauty of 
 Rutland Water.
