		<content>    This is the most important place in
 the village. Nearly everybody visits  
 the Post Office at some time during   
 the week. Apart from the usual Post   
 Office services, sweets, ice cream,   
 cigarettes and tobacco are sold there.
 There is also a small stock of        
 stationery items and patent medicines.
 For the benefit of those unable to    
 visit the town there is  selection of 
 fruit and vegetables in season.       
    The sub-postmistress is Mrs. May   
 Thorne who took over when her husband 
 died. She is also a state registered  
 nurse and a midwife.                  
    The Post Office is also an advice  
 and information centre for residents  
 and visitors and has an important     
 place in the community as a source of 
 assistance.There are two postal       
 collections and deliveries on weekdays
 but only one on Saturdays.            </content>
