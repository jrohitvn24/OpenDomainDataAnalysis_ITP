		<content>  There are quite a few religious      
groups in Chesham,like the Church of   
England,Catholic and Baptist.Lots of   
the people in our area,mostly in       
Sunnyside Road,are Asians and they     
worship in a mosque,in Bellingdon Road.
Most of the 34 people in our class go  
to St.Mary's Parish Church.Apart from  
St.Mary's there is a Roman Catholic    
Church,the Broadway Baptist and other  
types of churches.Three people in our  
form go to the Broadway Baptist,one    
person goes to Chesham Methodist and   
eight people go to St.Mary's.Fifteen   
people in our form don't go to church.
