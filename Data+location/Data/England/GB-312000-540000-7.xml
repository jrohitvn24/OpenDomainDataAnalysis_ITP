		<title>07A visit to the church 2</title>
		<content> It was a small room with two arched   
 windows. You could see down on to the 
 altar from the windows. We went on and
 we looked through a sort of triangle  
 window. It was the bell room. There   
 was not much room in the bell part so 
 we could not go in, just look through 
 the window. When we got to the top me 
 and Julie were a bit dizzy so we were 
 glad that we were at the top. From the
 top I saw the swimming baths and our  
 school and the school house. You could
 see the street and the grave yard.    
 When we went back down Reverend       
 Douglas took the other group up.
