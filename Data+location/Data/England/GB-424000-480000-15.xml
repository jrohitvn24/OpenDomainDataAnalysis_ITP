		<title>15Harvest Services in Well</title>
		<content> This annual service takes place in    
 late October in the Methodist Chapel  
 on a Sunday and Monday. The ladies    
 transform the plain interior of the   
 chapel using flowers and fruits grown 
 locally.                              
 The congregation normally about 15    
 swells to over 150 for the Monday     
 evening service as local people,      
 farmers and friends from other        
 villages gather to give thanks.After  
 the service a splendid harvest supper 
 is served followed by the auction of  
 the harvest gifts,flowers,fruits etc. 
 The money so readily given helps to   
 keep alive the Methodist tradition in 
 the village.                          
 The C of E service, supper and auction
 occur on a Friday early in October.   
 The decorations stay in the church and
 are given away on Monday.
