 for twelve years and has been on the  
 present site of two acers for five    
 years.The workshop covers nine        
 thousand square feet.Ninety % of the  
 timber comes from Sweden the rest from
 Finland, Russia and Canada.Bills of   
 Lading for one thousand cubic metres  
 of timber come every three months.The 
 timber is softwood and coniferous.The 
 best wood is kept inside the workshop 
 and the poorer quality is kept        
 outside.There are four machines,a     
 plane,a cross-saw,bandsaw and a       
 forklift truck.The timber is sold for 
 roofs,furniture,house timber and      
 packing cases.There are two directors 
 and eight employers who work from 8.30

 locally.                              </content>
