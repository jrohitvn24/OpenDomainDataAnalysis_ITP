		<title>11BRONZE AGE BARROW</title>
		<content>  At Carnon  Downs  we  found a  burial
 mound.      It was a Bronze Age burial
 mound.                                
  By the mound was a plaque.The writing
 on it said 'This mound or round barrow
 is a  tomb  from  the early  to middle
 Bronze Age, from 1800 B.C.to 800 B.C.'
  It is  protected  under  the  Ancient
 Monuments Act ,and it is an offence to
 injure of deface it.    The plaque was
 erected by the Ministry of Works.     
  The  circumference  of the  barrow is
 52.2 metres  and  the diameter is 10.2
 metres.                               
  An estate  has been  built around the
 mound and the  road is named  Parc-an-
 Creeg,  which in Cornish means  'Field
 of the Barrow'.                       
  There is  a second  tumulus or burial
 mound about 300 metres west of the one
 a Parc-an-Creeg.
