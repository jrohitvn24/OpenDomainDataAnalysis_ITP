		<title>04BLACKHEATH</title>
		<content>    Blackheath is an example of a      
 village which has grown up since the  
 19th century.Nobody really knows why  
 it is called Blackheath but people    
 believe it is because the heathland   
 soil is a dark colour.There was never 
 an early settlement at Blackheath     
 because the ground was not suitable   
 for farming and because there wasn't a
 good water supply, only a well.       
    The people of Blackheath worked in 
 the gunpowder factory at Chilworth    
 because there were no other jobs      
 around.In 1895 there were about 300   
 people living in Blackheath now there 
 are only 180 because the small        
 cottages have been knocked down and   
 bigger houses have been built in their
 places.In the future the village      
 probably won't expand any more.There  
 are few faciities in the village.     
 There is only one bus a week.         </content>
