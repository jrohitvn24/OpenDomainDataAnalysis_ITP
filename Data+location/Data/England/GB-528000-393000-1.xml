		<title>01The Wildlife Around Us.</title>
		<content> The Wildlife around us is very        
 numerous for we don't live in a       
 town.We have plenty of birds around us
 and not too many animals.The most     
 numerous birds around here are        
 pheasants because there is a game     
 service which deals with up to 500,000
 pheasants chicks and eggs.There are   
 mostly foxes, stoats, weasels,        
 rabbits, hares, rats, mice and bats.We
 have quite a number of finches around,
 because there are about 3 fir woods   
 which support finches. There is an    
 ornamental pond in a garden near where
 I live. It has teal, shelduck, tufted 
 duck, mandarin, carolina and some     
 others.There are a lot of mallard in  
 Ormsby because there are three ponds. 
 The rarest bird of prey I have seen is
 a sparrowhawk. There are 2 pairs of   
 kestrels nesting in Ormsby. By Dean
