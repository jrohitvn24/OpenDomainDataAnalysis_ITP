		<title>06Worlingworth shopping survey</title>
		<content>19 Worlingworth children were asked    
where their families shopped for       
specific commodities.Worlingworth Post 
Office &amp; Garage were very popular.Diss 
was the popular choice for clothes &amp;   
Ipswich for household appliances.Furn- 
iture presented some problems because  
of the infrequent purchase,Ipswich &amp;   
mail order had some edge on the other  
venues.Cooked foods purchase was spread
between Eye,Diss,Framlingham &amp; Debenham
This probably reflects the popularity  
off foreign food &amp; the rising cost of  
Fish &amp; Chips.The indicationsd are that 
fancy goods are purchased in Ipswich.  
Included in the survey were 2 American 
children.This family bought most things
from Bentwaters United States Air Force
Base.                                  
Woodbridge &amp; Norwich play a minor role 
in providing shopping facilities for   
Worlingworth people.                   </content>
