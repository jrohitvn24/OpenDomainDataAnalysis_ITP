		<content>   In Cramlington there is one large   
 High School for children from 13 to   
 18 years of age. It is a Comprehensive
 school, for there is no entry exam.   
 Four Middle Schools for children from 
 the ages of 9 to 13 send their        
 children on to this school when they  
 leave. The Middle Schools get their   
 children from the ten First Schools,  
 which take children from 5 to         
 9 years. Each Middle School usually   
 gets children from two First Schools. 
 Most First School children live within
 walking distance of school. All of the
 schools have been built since 1965,   
 except Parkside Middle which was the  
 old village elementary school.There   
 are Roman Catholic First and Middle   
 Schools.It is planned to build several
 new First and one new Middle School.  
 Plans for a second High School are    
 having to wait.          Klondyke F.S.</content>
