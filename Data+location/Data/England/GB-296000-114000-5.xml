		<content>    There has been a water supply      
 scheme at Allers Farm since 1886.At   
 that time water was taken from the    
 Town Leat and supplied to most of the 
 houses in Tiverton.                   
    In 1939 extra water was added to   
 the supply at Allers Works and This   
 came from the River Exe at Bolham.    
    The new Allers Works was started   
 in 1969 and completed in June 1971.   
 The area covers twenty acres and three
 people work there.                    
    The water for Allers  Works        
 nowadays comes from the springs at    
 Allers,the River Exe at Bolham and the
 old Town Leat.                        
    The water passes from the works    
 into one of three underground         
 reservoirs within the area.
