		<title>13A BARN DANCE AT RADLEY GREEN</title>
		<content> The annual Barn Dance to raise funds  
 for St.Paul's church Highwood was held
 on Saturday 22nd June 1985 in a barn  
 at Colley Bridge Farm,{RADLEY GREEN.} 
 The barn was cleared and decorated    
 with coloured lights.It was a cold,wet
 windy evening but this didn't spoil   
 the fun for the 100 people who atten- 
 ded.A caller shouted the instructions 
 for the dances,music was from records.
 We often went wrong but this made it  
 seem funnier.Everyone joined in some  
 dances if only to keep warm.We danced 
 the Gay Gordons,Strip the Willow,St.  
 Bernard Waltz and many others.        
 A supper of cheese,pickle,cold sausage
 and salad was served half way through 
 the evening.The landlord of the Green 
 Man pub ran a mobile bar.             
 A raffle with lots of prizes raised   
 over Â£50.The Barn Dance ended at Mid- 
 night and we all had a very good time.</content>
