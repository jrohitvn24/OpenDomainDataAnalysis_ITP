		<content>{OPENING OF NEW HEALTH CENTRE.         
 As Aviemore developed as a holiday    
 centre,it became apparent that the    
 medical facilities available were     
 inadequate to cope with the growing   
 population. The local practice has    
 increased from 2400 to 3200 patients  
 in the ten years to 1985. Doctors also
 have to deal with 450-600 skiing      
 accidents per season.The old surgery  
 with 2 consulting rooms and 1         
 treatment room between 4 doctors was  
 too small.The new{health centre}has   
 60 rooms on two levels.It has 4       
 consulting rooms,2 interview rooms,2  
 treatment rooms,a plaster room,a gym  
 plus facilities for X-rays and physio-
 therapy.These new facilities mean that
 the Aviemore practice can now deal    
 with many cases that before had to be 
 sent to Inverness.
