		<title>10Mills,Barges and Locks.</title>
		<content>    Our area has contained mills until 
 this century.Langford Mill is         
 mentioned in the Domesday Book.A      
 special cut from the canal runs up to 
 it.Since 1924 the mill has been used  
 to house pumping equipment.           
    The first sugar beet mill in       
 Britain opened in the 1830's by       
 Marriage,Reid and Marriage was at the 
 Hoe Mill Lock Ulting.It no longer     
 exists but Hoe Mill House and four    
 sugar workers cottages still remind us
 of this famous Industry.              
    The canal used to take away the    
 produce of these mills.Its barges also
 carried timber between Maldon and     
 Chelmsford.Now all the Barges are     
 owned for pleasure.One original 18th  
 Century brick canal bridge survives at
 Rickets Lock.
