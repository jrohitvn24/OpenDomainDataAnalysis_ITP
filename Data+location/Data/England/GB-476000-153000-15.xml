		<content> The block is policed largely by car or
 motorcycle patrols from Fleet &amp;       
 Hartley Wintney.{Fleet Police Station 
 covers the area to the south of the M3
 &amp;{Hartley Wintney}covers the area to  
 the north. The motorway is patrolled  
 by the traffic depts. from Aldershot, 
 Farnborough &amp; Basingstoke. There are  
 few{traffic accidents}in the area     
 (excluding the M3) &amp; those which do   
 occur are usually a result of speeding
 or underestimating the width of the   
 vehicle.{Recorded crime}in the block  
 is mainly 'thefts' from unattended ve-
 -hicles or building-sites. The occas- 
 -ional poacher is arrested &amp; periodic-
 -ally there is a burglary. Such minor 
 offences are, on the whole, what you'd
 expect in a small rural area. The rail
 -way station &amp; the M3 service station 
 are obvious targets for various crimes
 &amp; receive the necessary attention.    </content>
