		<title>10The M3 and My Garden</title>
		<content> Before the houses were built the land 
 used to be a part of{Windsor Great    
{Park,}and before the motorway, Tekels 
 Way used to be part of Tekels Avenue, 
 a well known local road.              
                                       
 The gardens used to be much smaller   
 than their present \ acre, ending at  
 the{motorway drainage ditch}that runs 
 halfway down the gardens.             
                                       
 The land beyond the ditch belonged    
 to the council and was up for sale. A 
 gentleman wished to buy the land in   
 order to build a hotel, but the house 
 owners in Tekels Way at that time, got
 together and decided that they did not
 want that, so they purchased the land 
 and extended all the gardens.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
