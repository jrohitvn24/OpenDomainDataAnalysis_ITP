		<title>06JOBS IN PULBOROUGH.</title>
		<content> A group of pupils from St.Mary's      
 School asked their parents questions  
 about their jobs.We had 76 replies. No
 replies came from anyone unemployed.  
 There is not much industrial          
 development, APV Spiro-Gills is the   
 biggest factory. 9% of parents work in
 catering, 7% in cleaning. Building and
 engineering employ 6% each,and 5% work
 in farming(surprisingly few), finance,
 management, and as mechanics. The rest
 work in a wide variety of jobs (e.g.  
 education, civil service, publishing, 
 gardening). One person reads the BBC  
 News.45% of our sample work in        
 Pulborough and another 29% work within
 10 miles. Only 7% work in London; one 
 parent travels up to 500 miles away,  
 and one goes to work by plane. 71% of 
 people go to work by car, 21% often   
 walk, only 7% go by train, and 3% may 
 bike.                                 </content>
