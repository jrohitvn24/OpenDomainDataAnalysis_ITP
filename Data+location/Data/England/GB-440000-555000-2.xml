		<title>02Londonderry Junction.</title>
		<content> This railway junction got its name    
 from the third Marquess of            
 Londonderry.Through his marriage in   
 1819 to Lady Frances Anne Vane Tempest
 the family became owners of collieries
 near Durham City.The third Marquess   
 built the Londonderry Railway which   
 ran from Seaham to Sunderland;this was
 a fully equipped line carrying        
 passengers and goods traffic.The line 
 stayed private family property until  
 1900,then it was taken over by the    
 North Eastern Railway.Today,only coal 
 trains run along this line;each day   
 between 50 and 60 trains pass the     
 junction carrying coal fro Seaham     
 collieries.One signalman works the    
 junction,he routes each train safely  
 on the right track.The coal is taken  
 to the South Dock where is tipped onto
 ships heading for power stations in   
 the south of England.                 </content>
