 Most entertainment in Burley Village  
 takes place in the Club or Village    
 Hall.The club is used for Bingo,      
 discos and private parties.Children's 
 entertainment is provided by the Youth
 club which is privately run.They also 
 have discos at the village hall.The   
 Youth Club runs a drama group.The     
 Village Hall also runs  an over 70s   
 club where the elderly people can meet
 socially.On Wednesdays the Cubs meet  
 for games and the Scouts meet at the  
 same hut on  Fridays.The Flower Club  
 and the Gardening Club meet at the    
 Village Hall unless they are going on 
 outings to gardens like Exbury.The    
 nearest cinema is at Bournemouth or   
 Southampton.For ice skating or roller 
 skating we have to go to Bournemouth  
 or Ringwood.
