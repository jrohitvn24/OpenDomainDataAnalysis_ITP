		<content>    Mr Barnes sometimes gets some very 
 strange animals in his surgery:       
 e.g.snakes, iguanas and{some very     
{strange circus animals.When the circus
{comes to Dewsbury.                    
    The smallest animals that Mr Barnes
 treats are mice,wrens and fish.For    
 fish you put medicine in there tank   
 water.The wrens are just one type of  
 injured wild bird brought in by       
 school-children. He does not charge a 
 fee for treatment of these. The       
 longest jobs are ceasareans on cows   
 and stitching up horses,there is a    
 high number of people owning horses in
 this area.Perhaps these present the   
 greatest danger some vets have died   
 after accidently injecting themselves 
 with a horse anaesthetic. If Mr Barnes
 cannot treat any of the animals       
 himself he may send them to teaching  
 hospitals in Liverpool and Cambridge. </content>
