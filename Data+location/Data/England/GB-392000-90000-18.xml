		<title>18Traffic  Survey</title>
		<content> We carried out a traffic survey on the
 road going from{Wareham to Poole.}We  
 found that there is more traffic in   
 the early morning and early evening.  
                                       
 This probably shows people are        
 travelling to and from, work. Holton  
 Heath Industrial Estate and           
 the Admiralty Research Establishment  
 employ many local people.             
                                       
 Many lorries and vans use the road for
 the Industrial Estate, and the        
 Admiralty Research Establishment, but 
 also the road is important for traffic
 between Wareham and Poole.            
                                       
 The road is straight and traffic can  
 travel fast, but there are two schools
 sited along the road, so the{road can}
{be dangerous.}
