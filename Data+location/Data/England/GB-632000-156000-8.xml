		<title>08Town Walls of Sandwich.</title>
		<content>   The old historic town walls of      
Sandwich are still very much in        
evidence. Many people believe these are
one of the best things about Sandwich. 
They have large and beautiful yew trees
on either side presenting the walker   
with a lovely avenue. Along most of the
walls there are trees of some sort. The
steps and hand rails are clean and     
upright with no sign of rotting. There 
are some cast iron railings which, if  
removed, would present a much nicer and
complete view. Also the flower beds    
along the walkway add too much         
formality and could easily be replaced 
with shrub or trees which would be more
in keeping with the rest of the walk.  
   There are two different views from  
the walls. On one hand there is the    
rurality of the river and park; on the 
other is the old part of the town. The 
walls are important to tourism.        </content>
