		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF BLOCK</title>
		<content> OUR BLOCK HAS A LOT OF LAND THAT IS   
 ROUGH FELL PASTURE MOSTLY FOR SHEEP   
 GRAZING. THERE IS MOOR LAND GOING UP  
 TO THE HOWGILL FELLS. THE FIELDS ARE  
 SURROUNDED BY DRY STONE WALLS. MOST OF
 THE GRASS IN THE VALLEY BOTTOM IS CUT 
 IN THE SUMMER FOR SILEAGE AND USED AS 
 WINTER FEED FOR THE CATTLE. THE SMALL 
 VILLAGE OF NEWBIGGIN-ON-LUNE IS NEAR  
 THE FAST BY-PASS ROAD,JOINING SCOTCH  
 CORNER AND THE M6 MOTORWAY. THERE IS  
 ONE POST OFFICE AND SHOP, AND A BUS TO
 KENDAL ONCE A WEEK ON A FRIDAY AND A  
 MINI BUS ON MONDAY. OTHER PEOPLE LIVE 
 OUT ON FARMS IN THE SURROUNDING AREA.
