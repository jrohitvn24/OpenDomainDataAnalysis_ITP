		<content> IN BYGONE DAYS WORK WAS A LOT EASIER  
 TO FIND.MOST OF IT WAS TO DO WITH{    
{FARMING},THE{SEA ( FISHING AND        
{COSTGUARDS)}AND THE{VARIOUS SERVICES}.
   NOW,ON THE{FARMS}THERE IS MODERN    
 MACHINERY SO LESS PEOPLE WORK ON THEM 
 AND THE VERY SMALL ONES HAVE JOINED UP
 TO MAKE ONE BIG ONE.IN THE OLDEN DAYS 
 PEOPLE MOSTLY ONLY HAD{BIKES}AND      
{HORSES}SO IT PAID OFF TO WORK AROUND  
 THIS AREA, BUT NOW WE HAVE THE CAR AND
 MORE PEOPLE WORK IN THE OUTER REGIONS.
 YEARS AGO YOU COULD LEAVE ONE JOB,    
 START ANOTHER ONE THE NEXT DAY AND GO 
 BACK TO THE FIRST A MONTH LATER AND   
 CARRY ON FROM WHERE YOU LEFT OFF.     
   BUT THE ONLY NOTICABLE CHANGES HAVE 
 BEEN THE{ROADS,}MORE{HOUSES}HAVE BEEN 
 BUILT AND IT WAS A LOT TIDIER BUT OVER
 ALL{LANGTON HERRING}IS STILL AN       
 UNSPOILT AND QUIET PLACE TO LIVE.
