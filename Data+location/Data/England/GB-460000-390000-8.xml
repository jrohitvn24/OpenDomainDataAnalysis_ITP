 age of 14.Nowadays they start at the  
 age of 16.In the early days they could
 work until they were unfit.Now they   
 have a set age which they have to     
 retire at,if they work underground    
 they retire at the age of 60.If they  
 work on the surface they retire at    
 the age of 65.Our pit is 1000m deep   
 and 8km to east and west and 10km to
