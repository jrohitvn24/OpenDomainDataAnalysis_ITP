		<content> In 1985 the motor car is the main     
 means of transport for making journeys
 over one mile. This means that in our 
 area most people travel to work and do
 their main shopping by car.  There are
 even people who use their cars for    
 shorter journeys like to and from     
 school. The alternative methods of    
 transport are limited. There is the   
 bus. This area has a reasonable bus   
 service which is used mainly by the   
 old and the young. The nature of the  
 various communities within our area   
 enables people to walk to the local   
 shops or to school. The new           
 developments in North Basingstoke are 
 designed with walkways and subways to 
 assist this. People also use bicycles,
 again this tends to be the young and  
 the old. The sixteen-plus group also  
 use the motor bike, a symbol of       
 independence and power.               </content>
