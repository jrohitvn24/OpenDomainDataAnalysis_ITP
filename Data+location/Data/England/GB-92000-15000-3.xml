		<content>   When we go to Secondary school we   
 have to stay in a hostel from Monday  
 to Friday,because it is on the main   
 island.The children go to St.Mary's on
 a boat on Monday mornings at a quarter
 to eight and then they come back at   
 quarter past four on Friday           
 afternoons.Sometimes in the winter the
 children have to travel in oil skins  
 because the sea gets very rough and   
 stormy.The Comprehensive school on the
 main island only caters for children  
 up to the age of sixteen where they   
 can do their O'Levels.They then       
 transfer to a Sixth Form College in   
 Cornwall if they want to continue     
 their education.Some attend a boarding
 school,others stay in lodgings.When   
 the students leave Sixth Form College 
 some of them go on to have further    
 education at colleges or universities 
 in different parts of the country.    </content>
