		<content> There is a{record book}in the{church  
 to record who came to visit it.A long 
 time ago the church had only one aisle
 but now it has two aisles.On a Tuesday
 at school the rector comes in and we  
 have assembly.The rector has a family 
 service in the evening at 6.30pm.     
                                       
           {THE CHURCH    }            
    In the{recording book}it has got   
 people who got married,deaths,and     
 births.Every week a church messenger  
 goes out to tell people when the      
 services are and other things.Some    
 times we have a church Fete.Before    
 today there were 51 rectors.          
           {RICH AND POOR     }        
   The people who were rich sat at the 
 front and the people who poor sat at  
 the back,but that was a long time ago.
 Now people can sit anywhere.
