		<content> A typical unit is family farm run by  
 two or three generations.Most units   
 are livestock rearing(sheep and       
 beef), a number also milk cows for    
 sale to the Milk Marketing Board but  
 two farmers do bottle and sell their  
 own untreated milk in the             
 village.Sheep are mainly of the       
 Swaledale breed, bred pure on the moor
 but crossed with a Blue-Faced         
 Leicester tup(male sheep) in-bye to   
 produce breeding females for final    
 crossing by a meat breed tup such as a
 Suffolk or Texel.Cows are generally   
 mated to a beef breed of bull such as 
 a Charolais,Limousin or occasionally a
 traditional Hereford to produce calves
 for sale to fatteners.Most farmers see
 no change in their future pattern of  
 farming but the impact of reduced     
 subsidies could produce enormous      
 social changes.                       </content>
