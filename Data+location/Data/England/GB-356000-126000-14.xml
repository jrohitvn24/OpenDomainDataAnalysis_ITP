		<content>        Our area has many trees, both  
 new and old ones. There are obviously 
 trees in hedges, but the main areas   
 are around Hazlegrove, Yarcombe Wood  
 and Forty Acre Copse.                 
        Hazlegrove Park used to be full
 of fine Elms and there was a grove of 
 Elms right up the drive, but due to   
 Dutch Elm Disease many Elms had to    
 be cut down. Now a new grove has been 
 planted in an effort to recover the   
 sight of the lost trees. Only         
 deciduous trees grow here.            
        Yarcombe Wood covers between   
 two hundred and two hundred and fifty 
 acres, and both Deciduous and         
 Evergreen trees grow here.            
        Forty Acre Copse covers, as the
 name suggests, forty acres(!), and    
 there are also both deciduous and     
 evergreen trees in this wood.
