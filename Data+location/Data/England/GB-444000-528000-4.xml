		<title>04FARMER'S WIFE - INTERVIEW</title>
		<content> We interviewed a farmer's wife who    
 also teaches at Wingate County Junior 
 School. Her husband farms one of the  
 Stotfold Farms. The farm dates back to
 the 1700s. The present owners have    
 been living there for 14 years and    
 farm 250 acres of land.               
 For the farmer's wife the day begins  
 at 7am. She feeds the animals and     
 then sets off for school to reach     
 there for 9am. She leaves school at   
 3.45pm to go home. When she arrives   
 she looks after her horses and feeds  
 the other animals again. They have    
 3 horses, 4 cats, a dog,hamsters      
 and rabbits for pets. The greatest    
 problem with the animals is when baby 
 calves get diarrhea and upset         
 stomachs.                             
 The farmer's wife teaches riding at   
 her farm as a hobby ands also helps at
 the nearbye Indoor Riding Centre.     </content>
