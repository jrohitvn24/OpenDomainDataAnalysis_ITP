		<content>{MARSH FARM SOCIAL ATTITUDES SURVEY}   
 A survey was taken into what people,  
 who lived in and outside the          
 area,though the urban areas of the    
 services and facilities in Marsh Farm 
 and Sundon Park. Many felt that the   
 services were inadequate and did      
 little to help newcomers settle in.   
 Many felt that the bus routes into    
 further estates were virtually        
 inadequate. Others thought that the   
 post office bank wasn't enough and    
 would have liked a branch of a        
 national bank nearer than Leagrave,a  
 district further into Luton.          
 Other amenities people would have     
 liked to see in the area included:    
 a police station, better play areas   
 and a wider range of shops.           
 The area did contain a number of youth
 clubs, libraries,and other            
 recreational centres.                 </content>
