		<content> Over 50 years ago the New Quay was a  
 busy quayside with many foreign ships 
 docking there.As fewer ships used the 
 quay side the area became run down,   
 buildings were left empty and the land
 derelict.                             
  If you go down to the New Quay today 
 you will see many changes are taking  
 place.The old buildings are being     
 restored.The Northumberland Arms Hotel
 in 1808 and once used as the Duke of  
 Northumberland's Town house is a      
 popular licensed hotel.Ithas it's     
 stonework cleaned and is modernising  
 bedrooms that have not been used for  
 years, so that people can stay in     
 them. Two other hotels nearby, the    
 Chain Locker and the Port Hole have   
 been retored and are now open for     
 drinks and pub meals.
