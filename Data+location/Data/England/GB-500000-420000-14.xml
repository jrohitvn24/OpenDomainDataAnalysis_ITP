		<content> Barton's first pool was an open air   
 pool. It had a main pool and a        
 separate paddling area surrounded by  
 a spectating area. In 1981 this pool  
 was closed. It was going to be changed
 into an up to date pool.              
                                       
 The new pool was to look like a       
 Spanish beach setting. It was opened  
 in 1984. It has a palm tree and sun   
 lights. The palm tree was transported 
 across from Spain and cost Â£2000.     
 There is an area for spectators where 
 they can sit at parasolled tables and 
 watch their kiddies have fun in the   
 pool.                                 
                                       
 In addition to open public sessions,  
 the pool is available for use by      
 schools, adult education classes and  
 local clubs and organisations.
