		<title>09ESSO PIPELINE - WINSON</title>
		<content> During the 1980's the Esso Oil Co.    
 laid an underground oilpipe from their
 refinery at Fawley to Wolverhampton, a
 distance of about 200 miles. After all
 the preliminary problems about the    
 exact location and compensation had   
 been solved, a strip of land 20 yd.   
 wide was fenced off, excavated to a   
 depth of 8 ft., the l8" dia. steel    
 pipe laid down, and finally the top   
 soil replaced. Every effort was made  
 by Esso to avoid known archaeological 
 sites, but various hitherto unknown   
 sites have been found on the line,    
 including a substantial early to      
 middle iron age site in Winson parish,
 high above the Coln.This was described
 as a hillfort with a large defensive  
 ditch. Evidence was found of          
 substantial timber houses, storage    
 pits, pottery, a grindstone and a     
 brooch.                               </content>
