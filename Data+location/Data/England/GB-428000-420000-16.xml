		<title>16SILCOATES SCHOOL GALA</title>
		<content> On the 6th of July 1985 on a Saturday 
 there was a Gala in the grounds of    
 Silcoates School. My Mother and I     
 walked to the school and went in to   
 find stalls selling cake, biscuits and
 buns. She gave me a pound note and I  
 went on 'Treasure Island' and 'find   
 the key' but did not win anthing. As  
 well as stalls and games, there was   
 pony riding round the field which cost
 20p. My favourite game was where we   
 had to pick an egg out of sand and won
 50p if the egg was cracked. Another   
 very good game was hammering nails    
 into wood. After going round the      
 stalls and talking to people in the   
 bright sunshine we left to walk       
 home. The proceeds were for the school
 funds and charity.
