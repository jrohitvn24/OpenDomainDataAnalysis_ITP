		<content> (Gibbins Lane - Jealotts Hill)        
 The footpath is potholed with gravel  
 at the start and then varies between  
 fields, ordinary road and farm track. 
 Footpath boundaries consist mostly of 
 hedgerows, wooden fences and land use 
 in surrounding fields is either hay,  
 cereals or grass. The path runs close 
 to Warfield Church and several private
 houses.                               
 (Hill Farm-Allanbay Park)             
 The first part of the route is        
 metalled track with several houses en 
 route. At Hill Farm the footpath      
 becomes grassy and later quite muddy. 
 The bridle path is only 1metre wide   
 with hedgerows and trees. Rabbits and 
 squirrels are common and surrounding  
 fields are mostly agricultural.
