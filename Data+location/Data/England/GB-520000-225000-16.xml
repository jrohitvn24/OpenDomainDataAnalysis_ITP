		<title>16HOUSES IN STEVENAGE</title>
		<content> In this part of Stevenage there are   
 lots of different houses. Fairview    
 Road was built from about 1900. Most  
 of the  houses  in  the  road  are    
 different from each other they are all
 detatched or semi-detatched. Brixham  
 Close  is  part of  the  New  Town    
 development called{Symonds Green.}All 
 the roads are named after seaside     
 towns. The houses in this             
 neighbourhood are all brick built     
 terraced houses to a few basic        
 designs. This means there are many    
 houses of the same design in each     
 road. In Brixham Close nearly all the 
 houses are the same except for the    
 flats and a couple of houses that have
 4 bedrooms. The new houses usually    
 have smaller rooms than the older ones
 and they have smaller gardens. Most of
 the children in our school live in the
 new houses.                           </content>
