		<title>15Wimbledon Tennis.</title>
		<content> Although Wimbledon is not in our area,
 its proximity means that pupils from  
 local schools are chosen to act as    
 ball boys and girls.                  
 Here is part of an interview with a   
 ball girl;-                           
 'How were you selected?'              
 'Firstly by the P.E. teacher;there    
 were 60 of us, but after the training 
 sessions it was cut to 18'            
 'Describe a  typical day.'            
 'we are collected at 10.3a.m.We go on 
 court at midday and apart from tea,   
 can be there until 8.30p.m.'          
 'What is your particular job?'        
 'Captain.I check the court for times  
 and see the team of ball girls for    
 whom I am responsible arrive on time. 
 Ihave to change the scoreboard.'      
 'What do you wear?'                   
 'Green skirt, purple and green shirt  
 and trainers,tracksuittop and socks'. </content>
