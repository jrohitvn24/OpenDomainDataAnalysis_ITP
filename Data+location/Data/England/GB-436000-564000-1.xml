 One of the major events in South      
 Shields is the annual                 
 half-marathon,The Great North Run.The 
 event has become of major sporting    
 significance with international       
 competition and a staggering annual   
 entry of over 25,000 people.          
   The latter part of the run is in    
 South Shields, namely along{John Reid}
 road,past the{Nook}shopping centre,and
 up Prince Edward road to the coast.The
 final gruelling mile is along the {   
{Leas}area and the finishing line is at
{Gypsies Green} stadium.               
   Many celebrities take part in the   
 run.Perhaps{Jimmy Saville}is the most 
 recognisable regular competitor but   
 local heroes from the {Sunderland}and 
{Newcastle}soccer clubs add spice to   
 the occasion.
