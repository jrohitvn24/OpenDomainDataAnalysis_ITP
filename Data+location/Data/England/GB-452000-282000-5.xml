 I get up at 7.30. For breakfast I have
 cereal,toast,orange juice and a boiled
 egg.I get ready for school and 8.35   
 my mother drives me to school on the  
 way to her job at a building society  
 office.                               
 Before school starts at 8.50 l play in
 the playground with my friends.I spend
 the morning doing Maths,English,P.E.  
 or Handwriting.At 10.30 we have a     
 break and at 12.00 lunch.I buy my     
 lunch from the school cafeteria.After 
 lunch I can paint,draw or write on a  
 given topic.Break is at 2.45 and      
 school ends at 3.30.                  
 At home I get changed and go out to   
 play until my father comes home from  
 work in a tool making factory.I have a
 cooked meal with my parents and older 
 sisters.I go to bed about 8.00.
