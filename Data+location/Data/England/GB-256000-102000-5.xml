		<title>05Farming in Woodhalls</title>
		<content> With the exception of a small area of 
 arable land to the south-east the     
 area is predominantly down to         
 grassland.Only two farms now possess  
 dairy herds and none keep any quantity
 of pigs or poultry.The farming is     
 therefore narrowly based on           
 beef,cattle and sheep.                
     Most of the farms are small to    
 medium in size,between 1OO and 2OO    
 acres being the norm.The smaller farms
 are particularly vulnerable to being  
 split up if sold.A 5O acre farm which 
 was sold recently had some of its     
 fields sold off separately to a       
 neighbouring farmer.The price of land,
 even though little is suitable for    
 cropping,can reach Â£18OO per acre.    
     Future farming will probably      
 remain dependent on beef and sheep,   
 in spite of the dangers of            
 over-production nationally.           </content>
