		<title>08HOUSING IN HARLOW</title>
		<content> Harlow is full of new houses built    
 since 1950.There are lots of different
 types of designs which make journeys  
 through Harlow interesting.The Housing
 Officer told us that most dwellings   
 are two storey.He also told us that   
 29% of houses had 1 bedroom,37% had 2 
 bedrooms,30% had 3 bedrooms and only  
 4% had 4 bedrooms.We did a survey of 3
 schools and found that from a sample  
 of 100 people 66% rented their house  
 and 34% owned their house.In our      
 twelve squares,just over half is taken
 up by housing which does leave quite  
 alot of space for recreation.Still    
 some estates do seem a bit crowded.   
 There is a fair bit of vandalism which
 spoils the houses.Our survey told us  
 that 60% of houses were terraced.Most 
 of the houses are brick built although
 quite a few are concrete which aren't 
 as friendly looking.                  </content>
