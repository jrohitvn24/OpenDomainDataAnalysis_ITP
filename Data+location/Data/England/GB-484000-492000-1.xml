		<title>01Hole of Horcum Area</title>
		<content> The southern edge of the heather      
 moorland of the National Park of      
 Scattersgate Brow escarpment and Hole 
 of Horcum allow fantastic views of the
 moorlands to the north and forests to 
 the west.   The southern part of the  
 block is given over to farmland as it 
 gently decends again to the vale of   
 Pickering.   Characteristically large 
 fields with no hedges; of grass &amp;     
 other crops, using the flatter,       
 previously reclaimed moorland.        
 Several small coniferous plantations  
 between fields, and to the north east 
 most residents are farmers.   The A169
 passes through the area so it is a    
 very popular place to stop and enjoy  
 the scenery.   Walking is also popular
 and there is a good selection of      
 footpaths.   Vehicular access to the  
 east side of the block is difficult,  
 but again the spectacular scenery &amp;   </content>
