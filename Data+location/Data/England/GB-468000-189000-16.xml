		<title>16Maidensgrove Coal Charity</title>
		<content>At the time of the Enclosures Acts in  
the early 19th century, part of        
Maidensgrove Common was enclosed.      
Before that the people of Watlington   
could graze geese and pigs on the land 
and collect firewood.  When the land   
was cleared and let for farming, the   
rents were used to buy coal for the    
poor of the parish in lieu of firewood.
Anyone living in the parish of Watling-
ton and paying less than ten pounds per
year in rates could claim this coal.   
The fields are still owned by the Trust
and are leased for farming.  Some years
ago however a cottage on the land was  
sold and the proceeds invested.  The   
rents and interest are used to buy     
coal.  In 1984 due to a miners strike, 
money was paid out; 14 pounds being    
distributed to each of approx. 150     
beneficiaries consisting of widowers,  
widows and old age pensioners.         </content>
