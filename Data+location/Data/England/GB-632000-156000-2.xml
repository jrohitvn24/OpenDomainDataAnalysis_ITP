		<title>02Local customs in Sandwich.</title>
		<content>   Sandwich maintains a number of local
customs, e.g. the ringing of the       
curfew bell from St. Peter's Church at 
8 o'clock each night. Another such     
custom is for the Town Sergeant to find
and cut a blackthorn stick to present  
to the Mayor. This is supposed to      
ward off evil sprits and witches. The  
Sergeant gets a crown coin in return.  
   A further tradition is the          
"Conformation of the Mayor Deputies"   
who come from Brightlingsea, Fordwich  
and Sarre. Deputies have to pay "Ship  
money" of 50p, 17p and 8.5p            
respectively. Sarre, short of funds,   
had been unable to pay this tax for    
400 years.                             
   Finally, the "Bun Run" occurs at    
St. Bart's Hospital on 24th August, St.
Bart's Day. Children run round its     
chapel and receive a current bun. The  
adults, who do not run, get biscuits.  </content>
