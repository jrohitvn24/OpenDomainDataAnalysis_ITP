		<content>  {Road}The main A21 road from London  
 to Hastings passes through the centre 
 of Robertsbridge.Large lorries and    
 coaches cause considerable problems   
 and it is intended to build a By-pass 
 to the east of the village in the very
 near future.                          
  {Railway}The main line to London is  
 within 1/2mile of the village centre  
 and is at this moment being           
 electrified.                          
  {Buses}The village is served by The  
 Maidstone and District Company by its 
 Gillingham to Hastings route.         
  Most people work away from the       
 village and transport is extremely    
 important in that it affects          
 the life-style of the community.
