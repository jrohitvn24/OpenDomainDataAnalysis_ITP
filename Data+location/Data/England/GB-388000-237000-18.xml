		<title>18Water treatment in Strensham</title>
		<content> There are 24 pre-treatment tanks which
 are primarily designed to reduce      
 ammonia, manganese, various metals,   
 detergents and organic pollutants     
 through biological action within the  
 sludge. Small doses of aluminium      
 sulphate and lime can be added to the 
 tank inlets if required. At the       
 outlets of these tanks the water is   
 divided into three groups of          
 sedimentation tanks, at this point the
 main aluminium sulphate and chlorine  
 doses are added, water is passed      
 upward through sedimentation tanks to 
 allow suspended solids to settle, and 
 are drawn off automaticaly using      
 sludge cones. The settled water is    
 decanted into troughs and primary     
 chlorination takes place, it then     
 passes through filters with a media of
 anthracite, sand and gravel.
