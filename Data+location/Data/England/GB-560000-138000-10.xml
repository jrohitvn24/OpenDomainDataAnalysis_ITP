		<title>10Traffic Surveys in Pembury</title>
		<content>{Transport, Traffic survey,Pembury.    
 Results from a survey in Pembury were 
 gathered from a number of people who  
 used the village in different         
 ways.                                 
  Motorists, in particular, who        
 travelled through Pembury either daily
 or twice a week, all thought the by   
 pass was necessary. Whereas others    
 consisting of bus users and infrequent
 road users saw no reason for the      
 costly development. The shoppers      
 questioned did not think that traffic 
 was much of a problem. They did not   
 think more people would shop here     
 after the by pass.                    
  In conclusion the majority thought a 
 by pass was needed desperately.       
  A copy of the survey is on the next  
 page for reference.
