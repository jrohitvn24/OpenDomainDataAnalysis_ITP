		<content> The Gate Inn nestles snuggly in the   
 lane at Boyden Gate, a quiet and      
 picturesque village at Marshside. the 
 landlord said that the people around  
 Marshside were nice friendly folk.    
 He had come down from{LONDON}for a    
 quiet life and nicer people.In their  
 spare time he and his friends play    
 cricket and rugby and the children do 
 horse riding. The main{DISADVANTAGES}:
 there are no shops, street lights , or
 buses.The roads are passable in all   
 but the worst weather conditions      
 though. Marshside Village is very     
 small so there isn't employment there 
 so that the youngsters have to travel 
 in to the towns to get jobs. This is  
 all due to modern machinery on the    
 farms. There are also{WEEKEND COTTAGES
 used by{businessmen} to relax in over 
 the weekend or holidays.
