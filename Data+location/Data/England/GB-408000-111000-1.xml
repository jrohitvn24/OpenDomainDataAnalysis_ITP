		<content> Terrain mainly for agricultural       
 purposes.   Some forest some heathland
 which is the responsibility of the    
 forestry commission.   Place of       
 interest is small garden with roses   
 and seat which commemorates the site  
 of Ebenezer's Chapel Built in 1807 in 
 mud and wattle by local people,       
 although extended was not large enough
 and eventually the existing brick     
 chapel built.   Despite efforts to    
 keep Ebenezer's chapel in good repair 
 this eventually collapsed in 1976.
