		<title>10PILKINGTON GARDEN CENTRE.</title>
		<content> Mr R.Brooks is the general manager at 
 the centre. He has worked there for   
 eight years though the place itself   
 has been open for twenty-two years.   
 There are eighteen employees and you  
 dont need any qualifications to work  
 there. They obtain their stocks from  
 garden centres all over Britain and   
 their biggest seller is plants. The   
 centre is the biggest horticultural   
 retailer in the area and they get most
 of their customers from within a      
 ten-mile radius. It built up over the 
 years  and is still expanding. The    
 hours of opening are eight to         
 five-thirty and ten to five-thirty on 
 Sundays. They get about four thousand 
 customers a week and 65% of them are  
 families. Mr Brooks is a keen gardener
 and keeps the centre in good          
 condition.
