		<title>13   THE MAINROAD cont.</title>
		<content>    Outside our house we had a car skid
 off the road because it was going too 
 fast and a lorry shed its load of     
 potatoes because it went too fast,    
 both happened in a matter of          
 hours.There is terrible pollution from
 the traffic.The exhaust fumes smell   
 awful and on a rainy day mud is       
 splashed all over. Our school is right
 next to the road and we can always    
 smell the exhaust fumes. The noise is 
 terrible and even when you are not on 
 the main road you can hear the lorries
 thundering past. Houses can gradually 
 deteriorate because of the traffic.   
    There are roughly 68 lorries and   
 168 cars per hour. People say that the
 A 17 is now a death trap.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
