		<content>Our block might well be termed isolated
because of the lack of busy roads.     
Only one major road runs through it -  
the A588. Buses are few and far        
between, (there are none at all on     
Sundays) and the single-track railway  
line between Glasson Dock and Lancaster
closed to passenger traffic in the     
early 1930's, so that people rely      
heavily on the motor car for mobility. 
Most families in our school own a car, 
but those who do not are very          
restricted in getting out and about.   
The canal could be used for            
transportation, but progress would be  
very slow and restricted.
