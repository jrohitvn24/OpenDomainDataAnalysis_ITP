		<title>16LAW AND ORDER IN CURY AREA</title>
		<content>      There are no Police Stations or  
 resident Policemen in the area of Cury
 or Gunwalloe/Berepper. It is policed  
 by mobile patrol cars from Mullion, a 
 larger village a few miles away in    
 adjoining area. Further patrolling may
 be carried out from the town of       
 Helston some five miles away. The     
 nearest fully manned Police station is
 at Camborne some fifteen miles        
 distance. This station would supply   
 the necessary resources and crime     
 squad for serious offences or any     
 major enquiry. There is a             
 comparatively low crime rate in the   
 area;though there are incidents       
 requiring police action and charges   
 being brought.i.e. Rustling! and other
 stealing from farms. Also other       
 offences mainly of a minor nature     
 which include motoring offences,      
 drunkeness, etc.                      </content>
