		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A SENIOR CITIZEN.
 Mrs. Durey is 64 years and has lived  
 in Castletown for 38 years.  She gets 
 up at 7.30 a.m. and after breakfast   
 does an hour's housework.  She makes a
 daily visit to Castletown shops to buy
 her meals.  She prefers to go every   
 day to chat to shopkeepers and        
 friends.                              
 After her mid-day meal she prepares   
 for a visit to Castle View Centre     
 where she goes 4 times per week.  On  
 Tuesday afternoons she takes part in  
 the old time dancing class.  She also 
 goes swimming, indoor bowling and keep
 fit.  Mrs. Durey enjoys these         
 activities, meeting and making friends
 on these occasions.  On an evening    
 Mrs. Durey may watch some television  
 before calling into neighbours or     
 friends for a cup of tea and a chat.
