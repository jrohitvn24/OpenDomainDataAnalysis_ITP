		<title>03THE HARTLEY PIT DISASTER.</title>
		<content>     On January 16th,1862 an appalling 
 disaster occurred at the {Hester Pit},
 New Hartley.This was the Hartley Pit  
 Disaster,in which over{200 miners}    
 died by being buried alive.There was  
 only one shaft divided into upcast and
 downcast shafts by a{wooden brattice.}
 The beam of the most powerful engine  
 in the north of England was over the  
 mouth of the shaft.                   
     As the shifts were changing,      
 almost the whole male population were 
 down the pit when the pumping beam    
 broke sending{23 tons}of iron         
 crashing down to seal the shaft.      
     Men worked until Wednesday,       
 Jan.21st. to release the trapped men  
 but by the time they broke through    
 every entombed man had succumbed to   
 the deadly{stythe}or choke-damp. The  
 bodies were laid to rest in{Earsdon   
{Churchyard.}                          </content>
