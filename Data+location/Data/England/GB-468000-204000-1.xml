		<title>01Thame General Review</title>
		<content>Thame, mentioned in the first Domesday 
book, is an historic small market town 
(population 9 500) set midway between  
Aylesbury and Oxford. This farming area
with its own cattle market is renowned 
for its wide main street designed for  
Tuesday open market, and has many      
historic buildings. To-day visitors    
appreciate careful conservation and    
fine antique shops. However, Thame     
continues to grow, having three post   
war housing estates, with new          
industries being attracted to the town,
and the third stage of the by-pass     
due for completion in 1986.            
Thame has 3 primary schools (see p. 16)
and a large secondary, Lord Williams   
(see p.15). In addition, there is a    
college of F.E. Rycote College is a    
fine centre for the study of furniture 
and rural crafts.
