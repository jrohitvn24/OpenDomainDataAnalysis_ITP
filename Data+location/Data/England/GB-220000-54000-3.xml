		<content>  Of the 228 replies to the            
 question'What is your occupation?',   
 46% stated that they were retitred.   
 Among the working population 30%      
 are women.The public services employ  
 18% of the total;the building industry
 14%;and retail &amp; distribution 14%.    
 Tourism was surprisingly low at 8% and
 farming with 7%(A figure probably due 
 to intensive mechanisation).3% are    
 unemployed.The remainder is made up of
 a wide variety of jobs.               
 Over half work in Pelynt(30%) and     
 Looe(21%) but 19% have to travel up to
 15 miles and 10% commute to Plymouth  
 each day(22mls).The remainder travel  
 throughout the S.W.Three men work     
 abroad.                               
  65% travel to work by car or lorry.No
 one uses the bus service from Looe nor
 the branch line to Liskeard.2 use the 
 Torpoint ferry to Plymouth each day.  </content>
