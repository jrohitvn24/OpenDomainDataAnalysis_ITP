		<content> July 1985 is the 350th Anniversary of 
 the Post Office Royal Mail Service.   
 The Post Office for the Roding's area 
 is in Leaden Roding, at the house     
 called Queen's Cottage, but it has    
 only been there a few months. For the 
 previous 20 years it had been in      
 in a house in Holloway Crescent, and  
 for 2 or 3 years before that it was in
 Coombe Cottage, Leaden Roding. There  
 used to be Post Offices in White      
 Roding, High Roding and Willingale,   
 but these have all closed down now. My
 mummy is the Post Mistress at Leaden  
 Roding.  She sells postage stamps and 
 air letters to send abroad. You can   
 post parcels and you can buy Dog and  
 Television Liscences. She also sells  
 Travellers Cheques to take on holiday 
 but she can't buy them back, you have 
 to take them to a bank.
