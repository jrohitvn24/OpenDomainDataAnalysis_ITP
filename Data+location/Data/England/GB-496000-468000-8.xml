		<title>08  Houses at Weaverthorpe</title>
		<content>   Apart from the{6 outlying farms,}all
{87 houses}are grouped in the village, 
 on either side of the road running    
 approximately east to west, along the 
 stream, the Gypsy Race.               
   As the {local stone is chalk}the    
 oldest houses are only about 200 years
 old, with the chalk faced with brick  
 in most cases, or else in pebble-dash.
 The usual roofing material is {       
{Yorkshire pan tiles}with some slate.  
   Most rows of terraced cottages have 
 been pulled down and brick houses     
 built in their place. Since the{34    
{council houses}were built in about    
 1948, 10 houses have been built, 4 of 
 them bungalows. 15 houses have been   
 extensively altered, 4 others are     
 empty and 2 are holiday cottages. 5   
 houses are for sale: from Â£17000 for a
 2 bedroom terraced cottage to Â£45000  
 for a 3 bedroom detached house.       </content>
