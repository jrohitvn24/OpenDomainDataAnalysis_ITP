		<content>      There is no Anglican church in   
 Bentley Heath so Bentley Heath Church 
 of England School Hall is used. It was
 consecrated to St. James by the Bishop
 Of Aston in October 1983. There was no
 need for a church until the new       
 housing estates led to a substantial  
 population increase. The church was   
 opened in Septmeber 1982 and monthly  
 services were held until the          
 consecration when services became     
 fortnightly. From September 1985 the  
 services will be weekly. About 50     
 adults and 25 children attend the     
 services which are taken by Deaconess 
 Saunders. Children's comments include 
 "I like the coffee at the end."       
 (Andrew Lang) and "The prayers and    
 Holy Communium get boring." (William  
 Pitt).
