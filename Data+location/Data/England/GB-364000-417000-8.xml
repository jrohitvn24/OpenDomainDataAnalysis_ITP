		<content> This area is under the supervision of 
 both a Countryside Warden based on    
 Tottington and a North West Water     
 Authority Conservation and Recreation 
 Project Officer, based on Belmont.    
 The local hunt, the Holcombe, and the 
 Pennine Foxhounds Footpack (which hunt
 without horses), based in             
 Huddersfield, cover these moors where 
 there are still foxes to be found as  
 well as many rabbits, hares, grouse   
 and some pheasant.  Pheasants are     
 specially bred and then released in   
 land lower down each October and some 
 return to the moorlands. There are    
 two shoots: Belmont to the west and   
 Longworth to the east of the main     
 road.  There are also small rodents   
 such as voles, moles, shrews,         
 hedgehogs, grey squirrels and         
 occasional badgers and lizards; roe   
 deer are even seen on occasions.      </content>
