         On Sundays my sister,Dad and I
 sometimes go for a walk.We usually get
 up at 6 o'clock because there are     
 usually more animals about and not    
 enough wind to blow our scent towards 
 them.There are many lovely walks      
 around Muchelney.One of the best for  
 seeing wild life is down Horsey Lane. 
 This is a long narrow track with      
 hedges on either side which are full  
 of birds and animals.We often take    
 field glasses down to the moors where 
 we play a game called 'Name that      
 bird'.We find this a very interesting 
 way to recognise birds by their song  
 as well as their appearance.If we wake
 early enough we often go down to the  
 farm to help our Dad feed the         
 animals.We give the calves hay and    
 oats, which have been coated in malt  
 to give extra vitamins.               </content>
