		<title>12FAMILY LIFE - MARILENA SIMI</title>
		<content> My name is Marilena Simi.  I live in  
 Abbey Road, Blackpool.  I live with   
 my mum, dad and two brothers Roberto  
 and Stefano.  We have Italian names   
 because my dad is Italian.            
 I start the day by getting up, but I  
 do not like it, and would rather stay 
 in bed.  After I have gone to school, 
 my mum goes to work, while my dad     
 stays in bed (this is because he works
 in Mama's Restaurant during the       
 evening).  My big brother who has left
 school goes to work, while Stefano    
 goes to the nearby Secondary School.  
 Sunday is the only day when we are all
 together, but we do have long holidays
 together, because my dad goes back to 
 Italy to work in his hotel for three  
 months of the year, and we often join 
 him there for up to six to eight      
 weeks.                                
                                       </content>
