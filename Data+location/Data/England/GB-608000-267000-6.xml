		<title>06THE GLASS ENGRAVER</title>
		<content>    We visited a glass engraver. The   
glass that he engraves is mostly lead  
crystal. It is not like normal         
glass,which when held from an angle    
looks a faint yellow. He uses a        
stylus, a dentists drill and a special 
compass with a bent point. To engrave  
on the glass you hold the stylus       
upright and press, then you engrave. He
first dots a picture of what he is     
doing, then he joins the dots. The     
dentists drill is for shading large    
areas.                                 
    He started engraving from seeing an
advertisment in a magazine. Then he    
tried with some help from an expert.   
    He engraves glasses and jugs for   
annversaries. He sells most of them by 
giving out leaflets.                   
    Before he was a glass engraver he  
was a head teacher at a primary school.
