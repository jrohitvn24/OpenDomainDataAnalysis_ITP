		<title>12Arable Farming</title>
		<content> My Dad works at North Hall Farm near  
 Wrentham. He does the same as last    
 year all over again. In one field,    
 such as the apple tree field, one year
 peas go into it. The next year        
 potatoes go into it. A different crop 
 goes in each year. Then, once five    
 years has gone past, peas go in again.
   A different crop goes in because the
 soil is just right for that crop.     
   In July, my Dad works at Wrentham   
 Growers'. He works the night shift. He
 is the boss of the night shift for    
 harvesting peas. The pea viners go up 
 and down the fields and when the tank 
 is full a tractor and trailer come and
 take the peas to a lorry. The lorry   
 goes to the Bird's Eye Factory where  
 all the pods and weeds are removed.   
 The peas are then frozen. J. Liddell
