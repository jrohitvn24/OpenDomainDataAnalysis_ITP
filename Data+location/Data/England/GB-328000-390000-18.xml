		<title>18      Allotments.</title>
		<content> Cross Lane allotment has been worked  
 since 1935.There are 31 allotments now
 on the site but there used to be many 
 more.The soil in this site is mainly  
 heavy clay and it cracks easily in dry
 weather.The fertiliser used is mainly 
 farmyard manure.                      
 Owners use the allotments for their   
 own convenience,and grow vegetables   
 fruit and flowers there instead of    
 their own gardens.People get great    
 satisfaction from tending allotments. 
 Since 1971 people have come from all  
 over Wirral to work in the allotments,
 but before that they had to live in   
 Wallasey.The rent is Â£11.25 a year but
 pensioners pay half price.There is a  
 long waiting list as allotmente are   
 very popular.Damage is caused by      
 pigeons and slugs rather than by      
 vandalism.
