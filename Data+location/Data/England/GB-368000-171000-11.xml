		<content> This is a small privately owned       
 garage. Its income is mostly derived  
 from the servicing and repair of motor
 vehicles. A small percentage of income
 comes from the sale of self-service   
 petrol. The customers pay in small    
 office, where sweets and cigarettes   
 are sold to supplement the income. The
 weekly delivery of petrol costs Â£9000.
 There are four petrol pumps, one      
 diesel and one parafin pump on the    
 forecourt.                            
    The repair side of the business is 
 thriving but the garage propietor     
 considers that the days of rural      
 petrol stations are drawing to a      
 close. The mechanics are engaged on a 
 self employed basis. 90% of the       
 customers live locally as the garage  
 is not on a main through route. The   
 present owner has been there for 13   
 years.                                </content>
