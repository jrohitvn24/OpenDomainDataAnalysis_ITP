		<content>  Changes In The Building              
 =======================               
  The original building was much       
 smaller than it is today , and the    
 main entrance was at the front , not  
 at the side as it is now . The        
 driveway wound in through the woods , 
 and only a faint track now remains .  
  The cellars may be original , but the
 central buildings are obviously       
 eighteenth century (the house was     
 built in 1559) . In 1920 an extension 
 was added to the West , which was used
 as servants' quarters . In 1950 a     
 hideous modern extension , with a flat
 roof , was put on the Eastern side .  
 The present owner , Mr. Jeffrey Smith,
 roofed this when he aquired the house 
 in 1981 , and it now blends in . He   
 has also built Kennels at the back ,  
 added stables and a barn , and        
 transfomed a cow-shed into a garden . </content>
