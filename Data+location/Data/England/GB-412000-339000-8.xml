		<content> There are many interesting places to  
 explore in the Norbury and Roston     
 area. One such place is the small     
 cottage on Roston Commom the home of  
 the famous novelist George Eliots     
 grandparents. The parish church is    
 another place well worth a visit.     
 Norbury Mill mentioned in the original
 Domsday Book is again very interesting
 but not open to the public without    
 prior permission from the owners.     
 These two very significant buildings  
 are not looked at in more detail      
 because they are located just out of  
 our grid reference. The Lecture House 
 on Green Lane is quite unusual,       
 private dwelling downstairs, place of 
 worship upstairs.Services held        
 regularly, see notice board outside.  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
