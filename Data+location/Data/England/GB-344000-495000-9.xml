		<title>09CROOK'S CUMBRIAN LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> HILLS,TREES,ROCKS AND WATER FORM THE  
 LANDSCAPE AROUND THE VILLAGE OF       
 CROOK. HILLS ARE SMALL,THE HIGHEST    
 POINT JUST 249 METRES ABOVE SEA LEVEL.
 TREES ARE DECIDUOUS AND CONIFEROUS.A  
 VERY SMALL SECTION OF THE RIVER KENT  
 FLOWS ACROSS ONE CORNER OF THE AREA.  
 ITS RAPID DESCENT OVER 20 MILES MAKES 
 IT THE FASTEST FLOWING RIVER IN THE   
 NORTH OF ENGLAND.A SHORT SECTION OF   
 THE SINGLE TRACK RAILWAY CONNECTING   
 KENDAL AND WINDERMERE RUNS ALONGSIDE. 
 DRY STONE WALLS FEATURE AS FIELD      
 BOUNDARIES,LOOKING AS IF THEY HAD     
 GROWN THERE RATHER THAN HAVING BEEN   
 BUILT DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE 18TH   
 CENTURY.SKILLED WALLERS ARE ALMOST A  
 DYING BREED,BUT HERE A YOUNG LADY     
 CARRIES ON THE TRADITION,AND IS OFTEN 
 CALLED UPON TO REPAIR AND REBUILD WHEN
 NECESSARY.                            
                                       </content>
