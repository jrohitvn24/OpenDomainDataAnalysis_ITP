		<title>07HISTORY IN BURSCOUGH 1</title>
		<content>   Burscough's main feature is probably
the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.It took  
46yrs, to dig.Work began in 1770 and   
finished in 1846.It is 127.25 miles    
long.Bargees' children were given      
schooling by Mr. Henrickson during the 
early 1900's.In the summer of 1901 the 
Canal dried up because of the heat and 
the Bargemen were out of work for 3mths
  Ainscoughs Mill was built in 1885 and
stands on the canal bank so grain could
be unloaded from, and the miiled flour 
loaded onto, barges.The Mill and Canal 
brought work to the village and the    
population has grown from 2752(in 1901)
to the present 8391.                   
  The oldest building is probably the  
cottage on the corner of Warpers Moss  
Lane and School Lane (1794). Other old 
properties include some in Orrell Lane 
(1879),Park Grove Residential Home,once
2 houses and the Library building.     </content>
