		<content>   In the ward there were only 6       
 patients as the rest were on a days   
 outing to Worthing. One of the        
 patients surprised me because she was 
 allergic to sunshine, lying curled up 
 on uer bed with a blind to shelter her
 from the sun.She couldn't talk but was
 happy when people came and talked to  
 her.                                  
   Some beds were just mattresses on   
 the floor with large teddy bears      
 beside them as many of the children   
 tend to fall out of bed. The wards are
 brightly coloured with painted        
 pictures of the seaside on the        
 windows.Outside are play areas with   
 climbing frames, sandpits and other   
 playthings. At the swimming pool a    
 special crane lifts the children into 
 the contuously heated water. We saw a 
 little boy held by two nurses trying  
 to move his limbs in the water.       </content>
