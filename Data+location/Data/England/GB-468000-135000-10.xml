		<content> The village has water,gas and         
 electricity but no mains drainage. A  
 general stores/post office is sited at
 the crossroads and opposite is a game 
 shop selling pheasant and venison etc.
 The Royal Oak and Rose and Crown      
 public houses are quite popular. There
 is a quite frequent daily bus         
 service(not Sundays) along the main   
 road into Alton but only a single     
 service through the village on        
 Tuesdays and Fridays. There are two   
 postal deliveries and collections on  
 weekdays. Milk is delivered except    
 Sundays. Dustbins are emptied weekly. 
 There are two public telephone kiosks 
 and a police house.
