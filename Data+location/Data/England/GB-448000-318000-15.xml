		<content> The School Crossing lady's real title 
 is the School Crossing Patrol,but she 
 is better known as{The Lollipop Lady.}
 There are also School Crossing men.We 
 need these people to help us cross a  
 busy road to get to school.           
 My mum is a Lollipop Lady.She has been
 doing this job for twelve years,for   
 the children of{Booth Wood} Primary   
 School.                               
 She wears a uniform so that people    
 know that she is a Lollipop Lady.She  
 has a white coat which is waterproof. 
 If the weather is foggy she wears a   
 bright orange coat which shows up,so  
 that cars can see her standing in the 
 middle of the road.She wears a hat    
 with{School Crossing Patrol}written   
 on.She also has a pole with a circular
 top with{STOP CHILDREN}written on it.
