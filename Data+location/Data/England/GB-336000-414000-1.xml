		<content> This is a low lying, flat area less   
 than 10m above sealevel with deep     
 peaty soil criss-crossed by drainage  
 ditches. Cereals and vegetables are   
 widely grown. Field boundaries are    
 ditches. There are several small      
 coverts of deciduous woodland but the 
 area is otherwise exposed to wind with
 a broad expanse of sky. The           
 Southport-Ormskirk trunk road crosses 
 the S.W. corner with ribbon           
 residential development. Other        
 communities include Pool Hey, Brown   
 Edge, Snape Green and Bescar. The     
 Wigan-Southport railway line crosses  
 the area, with a station at Bescar.   
 The north west corner contains        
 suburban fringe of southport and      
 associated services - the land fill   
 refuse tip, the crematorium and the   
 gas holder, a dominating feature of   
 the skyline visible for many miles.   </content>
