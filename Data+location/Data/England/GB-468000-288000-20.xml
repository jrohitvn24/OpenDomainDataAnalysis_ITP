		<content> What do people do at home?            
 The following are some of the things  
 people do that we have not mentioned  
 before                                
 Keep pets_Most of us have pets and    
 these range from mice to ponies.      
 Gardening_Most homes have a back      
 garden in which a variety of things   
 happen.Some people grow vegetables to 
 eat,some just have a lawn.Some even   
 cook on a barbecue in the garden when 
 the weather is good.                  
 A typical home consists of a number of
 rooms 3 or 4 bedrooms a kitchen a     
 bathroom a dining room and living     
 room.
