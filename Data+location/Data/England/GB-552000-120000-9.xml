		<content> 7.00 am my Dad usually leaves the     
 house for work.He is an architect     
 although he works with the Foreign    
 Office.7.30 am I wake up my brothers. 
 Before breakfast I pack my sailing bag
 with my wet suit,water-proofs,buoyancy
 aid and a change of clothes incase I  
 fall in the water.At breakfast I have 
 Grape Nuts if I can find any,and a    
 boiled egg.After I have cleaned my    
 teeth,I feed my rabbit,and get in the 
 car for school.                       
 When I am dropped off at school my mum
 goes to Sussex University to work with
 blood and unusual diseases.8.55 am    
 bell goes and everyone starts to walk 
 in.We take off our coats and hang them
 up with our bags. Until assembly we   
 read. I am reading a  book "In The    
 Grip of Winter " by Colin Dann.In     
 assembly we sing a song and are read  
 a short story.                        </content>
