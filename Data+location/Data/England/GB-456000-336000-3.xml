		<content>   {West Bridgford}is separated from   
 Nottingham by the{River Trent.}The    
 river is wide and deep here, so from  
 very early times there has been a     
 bridge across it, called{Trent Bridge.
 The present{Trent Bridge}has three    
 arches and carries six lanes of       
 traffic across the river.             
    Further upstream is another big    
 road bridge called{Clifton Bridge.    
 This takes traffic on a by-pass road  
 round Nottingham.                     
    Two{railway bridges}have been built
 across the river but now the railways 
 do not use them. One of them has been 
 converted into a road bridge.         
    An old{toll bridge}crossed the     
 river at{Wilford.}It has been altered 
 recently and now is just a pedestrian 
 bridge. The{suspension bridge}is      
 another foot bridge near to Trnet     
 Bridge.                               </content>
