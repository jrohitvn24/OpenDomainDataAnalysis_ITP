		<title>06HULLS TIDAL BARRIER</title>
		<content> As with many things in the centre of  
 the city, the Tidal Barrier on the    
 river Hull, is built on the site of   
 something else, the old Ha'Penny      
 bridge, called after the toll charged 
 for crossing. The present structure   
 was completed in 1980 by the Yorkshire
 Water Authority and it is designed to 
 prevent the flooding of the river Hull
 at very high tides.  This flooding    
 often caused much hardship to both    
 industry and to ordinary people.      
 The idea is a very simple one, a gate 
 is lowered into the river near its    
 confluence with the Humber and dams   
 the tide waters.  The gate needs great
 strength to hold back the waters of   
 the vast Humber estuary.  The barrier 
 is large: its concrete towers rise    
 over 40m above the river its gate is  
 30m wide, 10.6m high and it weighs    
 over 200 tonnes.                      </content>
