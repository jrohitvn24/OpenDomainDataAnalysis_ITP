		<content>{ Peugot-Talbot's}plant sandwiched     
 between the{A45(T)}and the{A423(T)    
 employs some  971  people in the      
 assembly of motorcars. This plant has 
 long been the{major employer}in the   
 area; formerly as part of the Chrysler
 Company. Jobs are not as secure as    
 before; partly because of increasing  
 automation, partly because of the drop
 in Home Market sales and partly due to
 the dependence on a deal with Iran.   
  The{Siskin Drive Industrial Estate   
 is growing in importance as a provider
 of jobs. There are 25 units already   
 with 4 more being built. Most units   
 are leased from{Coventry Council}or   
 from the{Coventry Trading Estates Co. 
  About a third of the units produce   
 components for the motor trade, a     
 further third deal in vehicle repair. 
  Around  900  are permanently employed
 on the Industrial Estate.             </content>
