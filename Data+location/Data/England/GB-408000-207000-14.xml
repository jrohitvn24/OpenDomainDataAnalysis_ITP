		<title>14FIELDSPORTS IN COLN VALLEY.</title>
		<content> The various fieldsports have a large  
 following and are a great tourist     
 attraction. Foxhunting starts in the  
 autumn after the harvest. The local   
 hunt is the VWH. The Master leads,    
 followed by a huntsman in charge of   
 the hounds and 2 whippers-in.         
 Harecoursing takes place twice a year.
 The Judge leads on horseback, the     
 rest, including the beaters, follow on
 foot. The greyhounds for this sport   
 are bred for speed. Harehunting is    
 done entirely on foot with beagles    
 which go by scent and are controlled  
 by the Master. This sport is hunting  
 and running across country purely for 
 the fun of it. Pheasant shooting lasts
 from September to February. The       
 organiser invites 8-10 guns and takes 
 them to a vantage point in a valley.  
 The keeper with his beaters drives the
 birds towards the line of guns.       </content>
