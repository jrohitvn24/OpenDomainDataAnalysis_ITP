     Wakes up at 7.45am approx and has 
 breakfast which is a cup of tea and   
 toast,and sometimes takes Master      
 Jeremy Delahay up to Gorsley Goffs    
 School.After making the beds she      
 polishes the furniture and then       
 settles down for a cup of coffee.     
      Newent is out of our block of    
 area,but it is where my mum helps old 
 folk(Grannybashing is the nickname)She
 gets back about 12.30pm and might     
 polish our  Red Morris 8 vintage car. 
 Then she would get her lunch,and then 
 Prepare the evening meal.             
       When relaxing she might switch  
 on the television and have another!   
 cup of coffee.                        
       Some nights she might go out    
 to W.I.,Guides,or meetings.
