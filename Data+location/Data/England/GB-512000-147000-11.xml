		<title>11EATING OUT IN WESTCOTT</title>
		<content>      This survey is based on answers  
 from 25 people in Westcott and Wotton.
      From the results of our survey in
 Westcott and Wotton. We found that 60%
 of the local people eat out on special
 occasions and the remainder celebrate 
 with the family at home.  Out of those
 who go out for a meal, more than half 
 prefer to eat at a restauraunt rather 
 than a pub.  The majority of people   
 prefer to eat a full meal rather than 
 a snack.  We found that older people  
 prefer the tradional meal with meat   
 and vegetables.  Only one person we   
 asked did not cook regularly at home. 
 Nearly 10% of those we asked were     
{vegetarians.} A meal at{Wotton Hatch  
 on Christmas day costs Â£21.00 adults  
 Â£10.00 children.  Any other day it    
 costs Â£12.00 a head.  At{The Crown,   
 Westcott a meal would cost from       
 75p to Â£4.25.                         </content>
