		<title>06L'ETACQ WOODCRAFTS</title>
		<content> This woodcraft workshop, which was    
 started over thirty years ago now     
 exports to countries such as          
 Australia, Japan, and America. It is a
 tourist attraction but has been set up
 as a commercial venture first. This   
 means that there is no formal         
 demonstration of the work of the      
 craftsmen. You could see a name plate 
 for a local house being carved or a   
 special piece of furniture being made.
                                       
 Some tourist items are made from the  
 many types of exotic hard woods which 
 are imported from all over the world. 
                                       
 There is also a show room and a cafe  
 on the premises but on a hot summer's 
 day what better than a cool ice cream 
 from the van in the car park?
