		<content> In our area we have{Hampson Park}and  
{St.Nicholas Park;}we liked the tunnels
 with slides on top,the swings and play
 area and the field for football and   
 other games at St.Nicholas.There is a 
 hall for Scouts and other activities  
 as well.                              
  There are two{community centres},the 
 biggest is at the{Oval.}For young     
 children there are playgroups,mothers 
 and toddlers'groups and under fives   
 dance times.For older children there  
 are{youth clubs,gym clubs,Brownies}and
 films in the holidays.Anyone can      
 attend{keep fit,yoga,bingo},jumble    
 sales or slimming clubs.For the elder-
 ly there is a{Golden Age club}and a   
 lunch club.                           
  At{St.Nicholas}there are few shops so
 not many people know about the centre 
 although there are  activities daily. 
 Vandalism is a problem there,sadly.   </content>
