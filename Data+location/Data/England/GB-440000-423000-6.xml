		<content> To play 'hopscotch' you need to draw  
 some squares with numbers in.You have 
 a little b;ock of wood,throw it into a
 square and push it to another square  
 with your foot.Then you hop into that 
 square then do it to all the other    
 numbers until the last one.           
 Sometimes in the playground we play   
 with a skipping rope.People twine the 
 skipping rope.Someone jumps over it   
 when it touches the ground.If you     
 don't jump over it you're out.        
 We also play'farmers in his den'.You  
 need a circle of children.One in the  
 middle is the farmer.We walk round and
 sing'the farmer wants a wife'.When we 
 stop the farmer chooses someone.Then  
 we walk and sing again.The wife       
 chooses a baby.Then the baby gets a   
 nurse and she gets a dog then everyone
 pats the dog.
