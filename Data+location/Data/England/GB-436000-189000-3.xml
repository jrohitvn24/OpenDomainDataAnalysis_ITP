		<title>03Local History Denchworth</title>
		<content> The name{Denchworth}is probably       
 derived from the owner of the land it 
 was built on,{Daunce,}and{'worth'     
 which means 'homestead'. There is a   
 mediaeval stone cross at the road     
 junction in the village. Another      
 mediaeval cross in the churchyard is  
 used for an annual service to bless   
 crops.  Magpie Cottage is made of     
 wattle and daub and is being          
 reconstructed.  The Manor House dates 
 from the 12th century, but most of the
 present building is 17th, 18th and    
 20th century.  Several famous families
 have owned it, the present owner being
 Max Aitken, main shareholder of       
 Beaverbrook Papers.  An old wool store
 and wooden thatched barns seen from   
 the road have been revovated. A       
 Cranmer's bible is chained in the     
 church. One of the old brasses dated  
 1337 is a palimpsest.{                </content>
