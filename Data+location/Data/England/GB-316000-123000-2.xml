   The Annual General Meeting of the   
 Parish Council of Hillfarrance and    
 Oake was held in the Village Hall with
 approx. 25 people present.  Councillor
 King outlined the principal concerns  
 of flood alleviation, public footpath 
 inspection and rights of way.  He     
 asked various speakers to outline     
 developments in their own interests - 
 the School Association, the Village   
 Hall, the Acorn club, and the         
 Hillfarrance Village Trust.The local  
 vicar and the Taunton Deane councillor
 spoke. I was asked to comment on the  
 Domesday Project.                     
   At the Parish Council meeting       
 following, discussion arose about     
 flood relief and the condition of the 
 roads.  The feeling of the meeting was
 taken about the addition of fluoride  
 to water and was soundly opposed.     </content>
