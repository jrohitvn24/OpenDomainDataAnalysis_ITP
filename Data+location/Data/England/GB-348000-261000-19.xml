		<content> In our area certain people believe in 
 certain customs,traditions and        
 superstitions.Every year in October we
 have a{HARVEST FESTIVAL.}We all go to 
{EYE CHURCH}and  have a special service
 thanking {GOD}for giving us a good    
 crop.Then the next Saturday we have a 
{HARVEST SUPPER }. Early in February we
 have another special service called   
{CANDLEMASS }where we think of the     
 light of{JESUS}and at the end we carry
 candles around the church.We hang     
{HORSE-SHOES }in the shape of an U for 
 we believe it brings good luck.It is  
 said to be bad luck to walk under     
 ladders.If you break a mirror it is   
 supposed to be 7 years bad luck.On    
 October 31st it is{HALLOWE'EN.}We play
 games,such as Apple Bobbing or Trick  
 or Treat.In April the first day is    
{APRIL FOOL'S DAY} where people play   
 tricks on other people until midday.  </content>
