		<content>                                       
  Our study area was{Wootton,}in the   
 north east of the{Isle of Wight.}The  
 main land cover in the area is fields 
 but there is also a large area of     
 houses and of woodland.               
  There are two holiday camps in the   
 area called,{Woodside Bay and Little  
{Canada.}The main{Car Ferry terminal   
 for the Isle of Wight is also situated
 in Wootton, these ferries also carry  
 lorries and coaches.                  
  The main activities are farming      
 and forestry. The farming is mainly   
 livestock farming especially dairy    
 cattle. The forests are owned both    
 privately and by the{National Trust   
 and the{Forestry Commision.           
  A lot of new housing development has 
 taken place in this area during the   
 past decade around Wootton Bridge and 
 to a lesser extent in Havenstreet.    </content>
