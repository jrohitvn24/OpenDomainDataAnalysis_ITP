		<title>04MACKAYS COURT FARM</title>
		<content>{Mackays Court Farm}is part of a 1,800 
 acre farm, which is owned partly by   
 the Church and partly by Mr.Castle,   
 who farms it.  The farmhouse is       
 situated between Middle and Lower     
 Stoke and the land forms almost a     
 complete circle around the village.   
 Mr. B.Stone is the manager and lives  
 in the farmhouse with his wife and two
 young children.  He employs eleven    
 full_time workers and up to one       
 hundred part_time workers.  The main  
 crops are corn, early potatoes, spring
 greens, calabrese and sweetcorn.      
 Beef cattle graze the marshes during  
 the summer, but are kept in sheltered 
 yards through the winter.  With all   
 these enterprises the farm is a very  
 lively and interesting place to work.
