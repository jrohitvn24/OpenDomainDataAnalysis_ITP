 Pigeons have 3 kinds of food to       
 eat.They only need to be fed once in  
 the winter and twice in the summer    
 every day.In the{pigeon season}which  
 lasts from{May to September,}they are 
 trained 2 or 3 times a day.There is a 
 race at least every week in the pigeon
 season,so if you come 1st 2nd 3rd or  
 4th you win some points.You also need 
 to set a clock. To set a clock you    
 just push a key down and turn it.Every
 year when pigeons are born they have a
 ring put on their foot,so if they get 
 lost anyone who finds them can locate 
 their loft.My father is in the        
{Easington Lane Homing Society.        
 Whoever has the most points at the end
 of the year will receive a trophy and 
 certificate.
