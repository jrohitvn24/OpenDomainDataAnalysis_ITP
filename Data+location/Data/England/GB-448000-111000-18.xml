		<content> The Market Hall and the new Botley    
 Centre (opened in 1982) hold most of  
 the activities in Botley.They have    
 playgroups in the mornings and        
 ante_natal clinics most afternoons.In 
 the evenings there are discos,keep_fit
 and dancing classes,badminton and     
 table tennis.The scouts use the Botley
 Centre.There are cricket and football 
 teams.The local pubs have live music, 
 particularly jazz groups and the      
 British Legion have a social club.    
 For teenagers between 14 and 17 there 
 is little entertainment besides a     
 youth club and most go into the towns.
 The Botley Carnival was held this year
 for the first time in 15 years.It     
 lasted for a week and was a great     
 success.
