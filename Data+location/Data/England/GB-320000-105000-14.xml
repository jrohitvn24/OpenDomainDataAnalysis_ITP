		<title>14A Day at Upottery School</title>
		<content> On Monday mornings our teacher does   
 the register and the dinner money,    
 while we usually do handwriting or    
 reading.We then discuss or write until
 first play. When we come in from play 
 we all get on  with some maths and    
 almost everyone is on different stages
 in the maths books. We do maths until 
 dinner time and when we have finished 
 we all go out to play for about an    
 hour and ten minutes. After we come in
 we do some project work which involves
 English, art, maths,science and all   
 sorts of things. The project might be 
 about Post Offices, flowers and birds 
 or mapwork.Sometimes we go out on     
 visits. We read,write,draw,make models
 and do experiments.                   
 We go swimming or our teacher reads a 
 story as the final part of the day.
