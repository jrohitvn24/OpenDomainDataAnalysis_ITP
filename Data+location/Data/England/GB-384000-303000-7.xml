		<content>A group of children from Codsall Middle
School visited the Station and spoke to
WPC.Turner.This is what they found out.
The Station is situated centrally on   
W'ton Rd. and has been in service for  
17 years. It is not manned full time   
now but was originally built as a      
police house with 3 upstairs rooms and 
4 downstairs. There are 37 officers on 
the Codsall force, including 3 police  
women. 35 of them live in Codsall. The 
tallest officer is 6'5" while the      
longest serving member has been on the 
force for 22 years and has received a  
Good Conduct Award. The Station has 4  
Patrol Cars, 1 Supervision Car and 1   
CID. Car. It is a busy Station but does
not receive emergency calls, these are 
directed to Stafford. They have a lot  
of false alarms from children about    
bogus fires and accidents. The most    
common crime is indecent exposure.     </content>
