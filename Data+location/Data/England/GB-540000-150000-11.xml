		<title>11NEW HOUSING, LIMPSFIELD</title>
		<content>  Padbrook 1 to 62 is the new estate of
 timber framed houses being built in   
{Limpsfield. }The site was originally  
 pasture with a few cottages which have
 been demolished.                      
  Houses range from two to five        
 bedrooms. The larger houses are bought
 by customers aged around 40 with one  
 or two children up to 12 years old.   
 The smaller houses are bought by      
 elderly ladies who are moving from    
 larger houses. There are no first time
 buyers.                               
  Prices range from Â£72,250 for a two  
 bedroomed semi-detached to Â£142,000   
 for a five bedroomed detached house.  
{ Limpsfield}dates back to Domesday so 
 proposals for development are subject 
 to strict planning policies which     
 ensure that the past is respected,    
 thereby harmonizing with the          
 surroundings.                         </content>
