		<content> I own a home computer; it is called a 
 ZX spectrum. I have had my computer   
 for about two years and it is still   
 one of the most popular home computers
 you can buy. The original ZX spectrum 
 has 40 keys but I have had mine       
 upgraded and now its got 58 keys.     
 Infomation from the computer is       
 usually stored on cassette but there  
 are other methods which are a lot     
 quicker.The ZX spectrum has lots of   
 games that you can buy.The average    
 price for a computer game is about    
 Â£6.95. I have about 40 programes on   
 cassette  and about 30 games. Some of 
 the games are not very good but some  
 are excellent.
