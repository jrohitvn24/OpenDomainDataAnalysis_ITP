In 1801 the population of Wenhaston was
578, growing to 1,094 by 1841 and      
falling to 786 in 1891.                
Thorington and Bramfield populations   
followed similar patterns of rise and  
fall, but their total population was   
only 410 in 1891.                      
The major occupations were concerned   
with the land and horses. More than    
half of the adult males were farm      
workers of some sort. More than half of
the remainder were concerned with      
transport, carters, waggoners etc..    
The remaining 25% were evenly divided  
between various trades; saddlers and   
harness makers, shoemakers, blacksmith 
etc.
