		<title>10Village life in General.</title>
		<content>   Except for the new development of a 
few bungalows, built by Cheadle Council
and some private home in School Close, 
the village of Dilhorne has changed    
little over the years. Victorian       
cottages sit next to farm steads and   
homes built for farm labourers and     
miners of previous generations. A      
picture of housing built sparingly into
those 'infil' patches of a village     
lying in green belt.These depict not   
only the rise and fall of minning but  
also the changes in agriculture-a      
social patchwork of English Life. The  
houses span the years with small       
cottages that once belonged to the     
estate;larger homes for those who may  
have had servants, reflecting a more   
properous Victorian era. Post war      
counci development and modern farm &amp;   
commuter homes.
