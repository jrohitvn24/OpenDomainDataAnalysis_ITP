		<content> This block contains the villages of   
 Tarrant Gunville, Chettle, the        
 Northern part of Tarrant Hinton nd    
 surrounding counryside which is grass 
 and arable and with several wooded    
 areas.                                
 The A354 Blandford to Salisbury road  
 passes through the SE  corner of the  
 block giving easy access to the       
 nearest town of Blandford forum some  
 5/6 miles to te south.                
 Tarrant Gunville and Tarrant Hinton   
 lying in the same valley and linked by
 the same road have more intercourse   
 with each other than Chettle has with 
 either, lying North of both on its own
 minor road and having more of an      
 individual identity. The whole of     
 Chettle is owned by members of one    
 family and the land worked by tenant  
 farmers.                              
                                       </content>
