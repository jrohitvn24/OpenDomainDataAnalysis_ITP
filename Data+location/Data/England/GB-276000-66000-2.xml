		<content> We visited Mr.Hubbard he said his     
{greenhouses}covered 18,000 sq.ft.The  
 temperature is controlled by{         
 ventilators                           
 and parifin heaters .He grows two     
 species of{flowers},Pinks and{        
 Anamones. His house and the church    
 were designed and built in 1851 by {  
 Loughborough  Pearson.                
 Each year Mr.Hubbard produces  450,000
 blooms .They are driven in            
 lorries to Birmingham Flower Market . 
     The greenhouses were constructed  
 for the growing of{tomatoes},but the  
 subsidising of Dutch growers by the   
 Dutch Government made it uneconomic to
 grow tomatoes so Mr.Hubbard had to    
 turn to the flower{farming}.
