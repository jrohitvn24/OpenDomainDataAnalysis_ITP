		<title>03A TEENAGE GIRL'S TYPICAL DAY</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.30. I dress, wash and   
 put on my make-up, this takes me until
 8.15. I then go downstairs and have   
 breakfast, which consists of toast and
 a cup of tea.This is all I have time  
 for in the mad morning rush. I then   
 brush my teeth and do my hair before I
 leave in my father's car for school.  
 We have 6 lessons a day at{Kingsdown, 
 which is the Comprehensive school that
 I attend. School ends at 3.45 and I   
 have to walk home. I get home at about
 5.00 p.m. I first get my school bag   
 ready for the next day, and do my     
 homework. After this I get changed and
 have my tea. In the evening I either  
 watch T.V. or go out. In Swindon the  
 main event of the week is to go to the
{Brunel Rooms}on Wednesday nights with 
 several friends to dance to a disco. I
 usually go to bed at 11.00.
