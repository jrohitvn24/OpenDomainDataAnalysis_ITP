		<title>11TRANSPORT IN BROOK</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
   It is{essential}for the locals of   
 Brook to have some kind of transport. 
 The nearest town is 4 miles away and  
 there is nowhere in Brook for people  
 to shop.There are{3 bus services      
 running through Brook,they can take   
 the locals to Freshwatwer,Ventnor and 
 Newport.Most of the residents however,
 own a {car.}  The people of Brook only
 need to make 3 journeys a week,at the 
 most,to do their shopping and they    
 feel that a car is just as cheap to   
 run as travelling by the public       
 transport system.
