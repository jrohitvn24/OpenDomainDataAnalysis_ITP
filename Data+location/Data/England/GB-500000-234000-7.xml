		<content>  THE PRESENT BUILDING OF THE CHURCH OF
 ST. PETER AND ST. PAUL DATES FROM     
 NORMAN TIMES, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS      
 PROBABLY A THATCHED SAXON BUILDING ON 
 THE SAME SITE PREVIOUSLY. THE OLDEST  
 PART OF THE CHURCH IS THE NORTH       
 AISLE,AND ON THE OUTSIDE WALL THERE IS
 AN ARCH DECORATED WITH BEAK HEAD      
 CARVING DATING FROM THE 12TH CENTURY. 
 UNFORTUNATELY THIS HAS BEEN DAMAGED   
 AND SOME OF THE HEADS HAVE BEEN LOST. 
  THE CHURCH HAS A TOWER DATING FROM   
 1380, HOUSING FIVE 16TH CENTURY BELLS.
 THE PORCH ON THE SOUTH WALL WAS BUILT 
 IN 1500 OF LOCAL BRICK AND TIMBER.    
  INSIDE THERE IS A NORMAN FONT WHICH  
 USED TO HAVE A SEALED LID. THIS WAS   
 DUE TO THE SUPERSTITION THAT EVIL     
 SPIRITS COULD INVADE AN OPEN FONT.    
 THERE IS ALSO A ROUNDEL OF 14TH       
 CENTURY STAINED GLASS SHOWING THE ARMS
 OF SIR DAVID DE FITWICK.              </content>
