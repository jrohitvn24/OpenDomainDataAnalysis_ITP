		<content> Although making clotted cream is a    
 dying tradition now,it is still made  
 in cornish households.There are two   
 traditional drinks,which are Cider    
 made from apples,and Mead made from   
 honey.Pasties are still the           
 traditional cornish savory food and   
 are made, and sold locally.Annually in
 Mevagissey there is a feast week where
 there are carnivals,regattas and fetes
 and in Pentewan there is a festival   
 called The Pentewan Regatta.Both date 
 back a long way,in churches on        
 Rogation Sunday there is an old       
 ceremony called the Blessing of the   
 Waters.It is traditional to build     
 Cornish hedgerows from slate.The gaps 
 are filled with earth,not cement.The  
 top of the walls are often built to   
 give a herring-bone effect.Eventually 
 the slate becomes covered over with   
 ivy,grass,brambles,and other plants.  </content>
