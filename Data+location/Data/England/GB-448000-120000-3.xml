		<content> The Chalk area is characterized by an 
 absence of surface drainage.However,it
 is well dissected by a number of dry  
 valleys,chief of which is that        
 containing the hamlet of Hensting.This
 relatively steep-sided valley carries 
 one of the roads leading to Owslebury.
 The Tertiary area in the southern half
 of the block,although mainly clay,    
 carries only one major stream -Bow    
 Lake -which is a tributary of the     
 River Itchen.There is map evidence    
 that the stream was dammed in medieval
 times to produce fish ponds south of  
 the present hamlet of Fishers Pond.The
 existing lake at this settlement,now  
 used for recreational fishing,has the 
 same origin.It is fed by chalk springs
 in the Hensting valley
