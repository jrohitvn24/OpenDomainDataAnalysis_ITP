		<content>Nettlebed Primary school has 75        
children at the moment in 3            
classes, it used to have 5.There are 3 
full-time teachers and one part-time   
teacher.Children from Nettlebed,       
Huntercombe, Bix, and Assendon go to   
the school.There is a swimming pool    
which is quite large, at the moment    
we are raising money for a             
new swimming pool roof.There is a      
school hall which we use for P.E. At   
the moment we are building an adventure
playground. We have already started to 
put things up. About 2 months ago we   
started to do woodwork which most      
people like.We thought it would be nice
to sponsor a family Africa in a        
village called Lesotho.
