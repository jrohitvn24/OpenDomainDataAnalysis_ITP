Farming is much easier nowadays and    
they have more free time now they have 
modern machinery. Before, when they    
used horses, it took them about 2      
months to haytime, these days it takes 
about 2 weeks.                         
     From being a stock rearing and    
milk producing farm,they have turned   
to rearing sheep and beef.They have had
to change many of their buildings,which
meant it cost a lot of money.When the  
milk quota was announced it never      
changed their farm.                    
     Their busiest time is when the    
sheep are lambing and when they are    
haytiming.When the lambs are fat and   
heavy they are taken to the auction to 
be sold for meat.This summer has been  
the wettest for many years and they    
haven't been able to get in all the hay
which is a very serious matter.        </content>
