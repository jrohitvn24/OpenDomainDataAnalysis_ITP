		<title>14ST.MARY THE VIRGIN (CHURCH)</title>
		<content> Parish church for the whole area      
 between Malden &amp; Epsom, St.Mary's is  
 a beautiful 12th_century chapel. It is
 first mentioned in the{Merton Priory} 
 records for 1174_89.                  
                                       
   {When the new diocese of}Guildford{ 
{was created in the 1930's, St.Mary's  
{was separated from its partner church 
{of Malden, thus enacting a wish       
{expressed by govt. surveyors in the   
{1600's. One of the reasons given by   
{the old ,survey was that}"the waies   
 between this &amp; Mauldon"{were}"extreame
 foule &amp; impassable".{                 
{                                      
{  }Much of the land tied to St.Mary's 
 was seized by the Crown during the{   
{Reformation.}Edward VI's commissioners
 sold off the church's ornaments, the  
 resulting 8 shillings being used to   
 repair Moor Lane.                     </content>
