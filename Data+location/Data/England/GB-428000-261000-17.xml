		<content>      The{Heathcote Sewage Works,}after
 about fifteen years of operation is   
 gradually coming to a close,for the   
 Warwick works is taking over.At its   
 peak it processed 7 million gallons of
 sewage daily;it now deals with about  
 150 000 gallons from Whitnash and     
 Bishop's Tachbrook. Owned by the      
 Severn and Trent Water Authority the  
 site comprises 52 acres and in its    
 present little used state (one        
 sediment tank out of seven being used)
 it is a haven for several rabbit      
 colonies.                             
      When sewage first enters the     
 plant it goes into the{sediment tanks}
 for the removal of solid waste. Next  
 it goes into{bacteria beds}where it is
 decayed;thence into{filtration tanks  
{and humous tanks}to be pumped,finally 
 into sludge beds;water being returned 
 to the system by way of a stream.     </content>
