		<content> These are some of the games we play in
 the playground:                       
                                       
 KILL. Kill is a game that we play on  
 the climbing frame. Two people hang   
 onto the bar with their feet off the  
 ground. You move towards each other   
 and try to push the other person off. 
 The person who stays on is the winne  
                                       
 KISS TICK. The girls chase the boys   
 round the playground and when they    
 catch them they have to kiss them. You
 give them 10 seconds to get away after
 they have been kissed.                
                                       
 CATCH. You stand in a circle and pass 
 a ball round. If you drop it, you have
 to run round the circle and if the    
 other people can get the ball back to 
 your place before you return, you are 
 out.                                  </content>
