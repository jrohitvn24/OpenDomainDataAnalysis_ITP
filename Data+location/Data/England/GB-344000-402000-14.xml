		<content>The road network in and around the     
block is very good. Through the middle 
of the block runs a dual carriageway   
which leads to St. Helens at one end   
and the M58 at the other. (The M58     
actually running through the corner of 
our block.) The M58 link is important  
due to its contact, within a few miles,
of the M6 therefore providing the area 
with easy access both north and south. 
   The railway station in the Junction 
is on a line which runs from Liverpool 
to Wigan, taking 17 minutes to Wigan   
and 31 minutes to Liverpool. The trains
are of interest as they are of an      
underground type with sliding doors.   
This is to accomadate the underground  
system in Liverpool.                   
   The bus service is a major concern  
to the residents. The services run to  
St. Helens, Ormskirk and Liverpool     
however these are infrequent.          </content>
