		<title>08LITTLE EAST STANDEN BARN</title>
		<content>    The Barn at Little East Standen    
 Farm is older than the farm house     
 itself.                               
    On the walls are carvings of dates 
 from 1200 to 1926.  There are also    
 tally marks on the bricks which the   
 workers would have used. Wall markings
 reveal the enlargements of the barn   
 where larger machinery needed extra   
 storage room.  The pine beams are     
 thought to have come from a ship.     
    In the barn is a doorway that leads
 into the oldest part which is the     
 mill.  It hasn't been extended so it  
 is lower than the barn itself.        
 Attached to the barn is a round       
 building which from Saxon times was   
 used by a donkey which turned the     
 millstone.  The roof of the mill is   
 slate though earlier was thatch.  The 
 mill is the only one of its kind on   
 the Island and dates to medieval times</content>
