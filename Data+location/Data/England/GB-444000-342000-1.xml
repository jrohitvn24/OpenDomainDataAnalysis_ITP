		<content> Our area is part of the town of{      
{ILKESTON}which is the third largest   
 town in Derbyshire. It stands on high 
 ground above the{Erewash Valley}on the
 eastern border of Derbyshire. It is 9 
 miles north east of Derby and 7 miles 
 north west of Nottingham. Ilkeston was
 known as{Tilchestune}in the original  
{Domesday Survey.}                     
 Iron and concrete products, light     
 engineering, hosiery, lingerie, lace  
 and fabrics form the{basic industries;
 but there are also plastics, bedding, 
 knitwear, packaging, electrical goods,
 electronics, food distribution and a  
 variety of small industries. {Coal    
{mining,}once a major industry, has    
 gone from the town itself and more    
 than one site has been turned into a  
 recreation ground or playing field.   
{Cotmanhay,}once a separate village, is
 now part of the town of Ilkeston.     </content>
