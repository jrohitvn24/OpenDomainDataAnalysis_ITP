		<content> On Sundays I wake up between 7am and  
 8am.  I have breakfast of cereals and 
 toast.  I get ready for church which  
 is at 10am.  The church we attend is  
 St.Mary's R.C. in Evesham.  Mass      
 usually takes about an hour and is    
 said by Father Kenny.  We return from 
 church and have lunch about 1pm.      
 Lunch usually consists of roast meat  
 and vegetables.  After lunch we take  
 the dogs for a walk over the fields.  
 When we come home we play in the      
 garden if the weather is fine and     
 afterwards we have tea.  Later in the 
 evening we have a bath and wash our   
 hair ready for school the next day.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
