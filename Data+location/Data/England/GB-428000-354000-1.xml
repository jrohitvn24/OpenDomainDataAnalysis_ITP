		<content> This block mainly consists of the     
 village of Cromford and part of       
 Wirksworth, the majority of land being
 rough pasture. Quarrying, forestry,   
 cattle and sheep grazing and tourism  
 form the major activities.            
 Wirksworth is historically interesting
 as a centre of lead-mining, Cromford  
 as an early example of a village      
 radically altered by Arkwright's      
 cotton spinning factory.  Many relics 
 of its former use attract large       
 numbers of interested visitors.  The  
 High  Peak Trail, Cromford Canal, the 
 Black Rocks' picnic site, by          
 attracting visitors, help to alleviate
 pressure on the nearby Peak District  
 National Park. Through this block, the
 Derwent Valley winds with its superb  
 scenery and natural lines of          
 communication by road, rail, river and
 canal.                                </content>
