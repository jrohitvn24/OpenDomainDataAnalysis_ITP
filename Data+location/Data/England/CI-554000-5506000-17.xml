		<content> The hospital was built in 1926 though 
 it was very small.It would only fit up
 to eight beds.In 1958 the hospital was
 enlarged to fit 24 beds.36 people now 
 work there - 23 nurses,5 kitchen      
 staff,5 domestics,1 gardener,1 repair 
 man and 1 washing lady.Altogether     
 there are 10 night staff including    
 three nurses.Patients are divided into
 two groups - casualties and           
 geriatrics(old people).For big        
 operations patients are sent to       
 Guernsey and Southampton but small    
 ones can be done here(like getting out
 moles).The commonest illnesses are    
 bronchitis,strokes and heart          
 attacks.You can visit children at all 
 times but times are restricted for    
 adults.There are four doctors - Dr    
 Eagle,Dr Quanten and Drs Robertson.
