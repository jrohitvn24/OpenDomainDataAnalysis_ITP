		<content> Typical of others in the D-Block is   
 C----- Farm,Stalham. With limited live
 stock(14 calves for fattening) its 230
 acres are largely devoted to arable:  
 100 to wheat, 30 to peas for canning  
 and 43 to sugar beet for processing at
 Cantley. The remaining acreage is for 
 home use.                             
 Machinery used includes a combine     
 harvester,four main tractors, two     
 "running about"tractors, a potato     
 planter,  a large sprayer,a cultivator
 and a beet drill.                     
 In 1871,it took ten men and four boys 
 to work the land i.e. one man to 20   
 acres.In 1965, just five men were     
 employed i.e. one man to 46 acres.    
 Today  just 2 are employed:one man to 
 115 acres.
