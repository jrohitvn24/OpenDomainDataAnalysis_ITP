		<content> There used to be a{police station}in  
 Axbridge but it was closed down and   
 converted to housing accomodation.    
 Axbridge has only one policeman, he   
 has an office on the side of his house
 and this has to act as  the police    
 station.                              
 Our{local policemen}used to drive     
 around in cars that were painted pale 
 blue and white- hence the name panda  
 cars! Now most of the cars are all    
 white with a chequered stripe along   
 the side. They are usually Ford       
 Escorts.                              
 The most common problems we have in   
 Axbridge  are{vandalism and litter.   
 It is a fairly quiet place and crime  
 is not a serious worry.Because the    
 parking spaces are not clearly marked 
 in the square people park where they  
 shouldn't.Some of the policemen who   
 live in Axbridge work in Cheddar etc. </content>
