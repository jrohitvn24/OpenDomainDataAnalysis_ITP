		<title>12LITTLEPORT CHURCHES</title>
		<content> Although parts are older, the present 
{St. Georges Church}dates from the     
 fifteenth century. The vicars can be  
 traced to 1250. The tower is 23 metres
 high. The Littleport{Fair}and{Feast   
 are in the Summer, due to difficulties
 crossing the waterlogged fens on the  
 Saint's day. There used to be 3       
 parishes and 4 clergy, but these have 
 been reduced to one of each. About 100
 people actively support the church.   
 The latest development is the         
 conversion of the North Aisle into    
{Parish Rooms.}                        
                                       
 The other churches are Methodist,     
 Salvation Army, Evangelical and Gospel
 Hall. Each have a similar sized active
 support to the Church of England. The 
{Methodists}could lose their minister  
 in two years.
