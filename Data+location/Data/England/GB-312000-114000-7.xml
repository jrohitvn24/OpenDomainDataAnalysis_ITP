		<content> At Culm Pyne by 1981 there was a 65   
 cow milking herd and 45 acres were    
 planted with bittersweet cider apple  
 trees on 14 varieties of dwarf stock  
 under 25 year contract to Taunton     
 Cider Company. 6 tons crop collected  
 in 1983, 1984-22 tons, new machine    
 will gather up 200-300tons a year by  
 1986.Traditional farming appears to be
 in decline, providing insufficient    
 income alone to support a family to   
 present day living standards. Those   
 who are aware of this have a second   
 earning capacity such as road haulage 
 tourism, letting farm flats or        
 cottages as self catering units, cider
 orchards;some wives earn money        
 outside. However in spite of frequent 
 rain in 1985, worries with the E.E.C.,
 cut milk quotas, the hardworking      
 Blackdown farmer is determined to     
 preserve his independent way of life. </content>
