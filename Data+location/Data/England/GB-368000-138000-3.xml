		<title>03Family life in Brewham.</title>
		<content>    Our{family}consists of four people,
 my sister Jenny, mum, dad and me. I am
 eleven and Jenny is thirteen.         
    We have two{dogs}aged one year and 
 thirteen years. I have to take the    
 youngest one for a walk every day.    
    Some days we all go to see our     
{grandparents}who live in{Warminster   
 (about 13 miles away). Our other      
{grandparents}live in{Maidstone}and,   
 when he was small, my dad lived there 
 too. We have lots of{relatives}and    
 they are scattered about the country  
 (&amp; world). Most of the time we are all
 doing separate things with dad at     
 work, Jenny at her friends and mum and
 me doing various things.              
    At mealtimes we don't chat much to 
 dad because usually he's{reading}the  
 newspaper and has the{radio}on and    
 doesn't like being interrupted.
