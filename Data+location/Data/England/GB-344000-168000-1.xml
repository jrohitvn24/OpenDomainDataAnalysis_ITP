		<title>01Local History of Nailsea</title>
		<content>{Nailsea}is a fast-growing town. The   
{population}in{1985}is approximately   
 15 000 people.                        
 The Town is situated about 16         
 kilometres south-west of Bristol and  
 24 kilometres north-east of           
 Weston-super-Mare.                    
 Originally, Nailsea was just a cluster
 of small hamlets joined by winding    
 country lanes. The main reason for the
 sudden growth of Nailsea into a town  
 during the 18th and 19th centuries was
 the discovery of{coal}at comparatively
 shallow depths and, later, the setting
 up of the{glass-works}near the source 
 of fuel,the coal-mines. Today nothing 
 is left of the coal-mines except for  
 some ruins of mine-shafts.The         
 glass-works have disappeared too but a
 site just south of the High Street is 
 being excavated to reveal the base of 
 one of the old glass-works cones.     </content>
