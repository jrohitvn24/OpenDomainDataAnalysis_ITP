		<content> This is the story of a local{'ghost'. 
 There had been a{convent}near a bridge
 in the middle ages.One young nun there
 a novice had fallen in love with the  
 son of a neighbouring nobleman,who    
 wished her to be released from her    
 vows so he could marry her.However her
 family would not hear of her bringing 
 shame on them.One night he arranged to
 slip out and meet her brother at the  
 bridge to discuss the problem.This    
 brother had persuaded her to come,by  
 appearing sympathetic,but the young   
 nun's body was found in the river the 
 next day.Her lover claimed that her   
 brother had drowned her in order to   
 save the family's honour.This was     
 never proved but from then on the     
 bridge became known as{Nun's          
{bridge.}People still see the ghost in 
{Hinchingbrooke House,}as that was the 
 site of the original convent.         </content>
