 meeting to build a new village hall   
 with the help of a grant from the{EEC 
{Integrated Rural Development Scheme.  
 The Monyash Village Hall Steering     
 Committee agreed a long_term lease of 
 the land and the old building         
 belonging to the{Womens Institute. }  
   The new village hall is a timber-   
 frame building clad in a mixture of   
 random limestone and timber.It has    
 cost{Â£38,000}to build.The village     
 contribution (Â£6,500) has been made in
 labour and materials.                 
     The new hall will be used by the  
 local{primary school}as a dining room 
 and school hall and by local          
 organisations such as the Mother and  
 Toddler Group and the W.I..The hall   
 came into use in April,1985 and is to 
 be officially opened by the{Duchess of
{Devonshire}later this year.           </content>
