		<content> This Domesday Survey block is  in  the
 far west of Greater{London.}Most of it
 lies within the Borough  of{Hillingdon
 (a small part  is  in  the  Borough of
{Ealing).                              
  The edges of  the  block  cut  across
 natural  communities;   for  instance,
 Ickenham in the North West  and  North
 Hillingdon in the South West.         
  The outside of  the  area  is  mainly
{housing.}In the centre there  is a lot
 of "open space", including two  farms,
 an airbase and a sewage works.        
{ Transport}is an important theme. Many
 people who live in the area travel  to
 work outside it. Many  commuters  pass
 through every day on their way to  and
 from work. Then, of course,  there  is
 the airbase.
