		<content>   Orton Church is dedicated to "All   
 Saints" and was originally in the care
 of the Priory of Conishead. The       
 original church, which stood on the   
 present site, was a Norman structure. 
 The building today has parts which are
 over 700 years old. The tower was     
 probably built in 1504, the porch was 
 erected in 1607 and the font, made of 
 fine sandstone, is inscribed with the 
 date 1662. Restoration of the chancel 
 was carried out in 1877 and the tower 
 was restored in 1977.                 
   The rectory and advowson of the     
 parish of Orton were bought in 1618 by
 three parishoners for  Â£570, in trust 
 for the landowners within the parish. 
 0rton is one of very few parishes     
 in this country whos Vicar is         
 elected to office by vote.            
   The Methodist Church in the village 
 was built in 1833 by Stephen Brunskill</content>
