		<title>02RUSHALL HALL/PARK LIME PITS</title>
		<content>{Rushall}came from the{Anglo-Saxon}name
{Ryschale}meaning Rush Hall. The walls 
 around Rushall Hall are made of       
{limestone}and{sandstone. The Park Lime
{Pits}lake, near the Hall, was a       
 limestone working that caved in,      
 flooded and formed the present lake.  
 Above the gates of the Hall there is  
 the coat of arms of the{Harpur}family.
 The first Hall on the present site was
 built in the{12th Century}from        
 sandstone. Many surrounding roads were
 named after the families who once     
 lived at Rushall Hall such as{Leigh,  
{Mellish}and{Buchanan. Prince Rupert   
 captured the Hall during the{Civil    
{War.}It is possible to find cannon    
 balls from the seige. Next to Rushall 
 Hall is{Rushall Parish Church}that    
 holds its annual garden party in the  
 grounds of the Hall.
