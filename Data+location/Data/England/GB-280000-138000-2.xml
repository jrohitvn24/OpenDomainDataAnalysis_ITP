		<title>02Our Visit to Westermill Farm</title>

 When we arrived at the farm we got    
 out of the minibus and waited for our 
 teachers to tell us what we were      
 doing. They said we were going for a  
 walk. We went through the farm yard   
 which included some dogs, chickens and
 ducks. Then we came to some fields    
 with cows in which was the start of   
 our walk. In the field we saw a white 
 cow which had just had a calf. We had 
 to follow some red arrows through     
 fields and because Mr. Smith couldn't 
 find them we went the wrong way.      
 Along our route we passed meadows and 
 pastures and climbed up to the open   
 moor where we found an ancient        
 standing stone.
