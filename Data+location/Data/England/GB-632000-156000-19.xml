		<title>19Worth Pond:Reconstruction</title>
		<content>After solving the problems a lining of 
sand and straw was put down so that    
sharp stones could not pierce a hole in
the lining once it had been put in.    
After that the lining was put in and   
the pond was refilled.There was still  
some money left to buy some plants,fish
and special plant containers for the   
water.                                 
A couple of days after the pond was    
finished there was a torrential down   
pour during the night and the pond was 
flooded.This was because the drainage  
pipe that should have taken the excess 
water away was broken.                 
The pond was opened on June 9th by Lady
Julia Pender.                          
Now there is a kind of island next to  
the school and they are going to let   
that island grow wild.There are plants 
round the outside of the pond.Tadpoles 
newts,carp and ducks will soon be seen.</content>
