		<title>12Parents Hobbies 2.</title>
		<content>  My dad's hobby is fishing, he likes  
 this because it gets him out in the   
 country. He likes it best when the sun
 is shining because he says that it's  
 the best time to catch fish.Dad has   
 liked fishing ever since he was a     
 small boy, the first time he went     
 fishing he used a  long stick and a   
 piece of string tied to one end,this  
 had a loop so that the worm used as   
 bait could be fastened.Today he uses a
 float attached to a line with a hook  
 on the end. In his young days he said 
 he didn't catch many fish  because the
 string was not strong enough and he   
 wasn't quick enough to pull up the    
 fish.                                 
  Mum's hobby is gardening she does it 
 partly because she enjoys it and      
 partly because dad doesn't get the    
 time.She works hard sowing seeds      
 cutting grass and weeding.            </content>
