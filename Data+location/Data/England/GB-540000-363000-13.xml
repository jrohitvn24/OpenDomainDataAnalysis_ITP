		<title>13HALTON SINGERS</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Halton Singers- formed in 1973-   
 are a group of adults interested in   
 singing madrigals, hymns, carols and  
 folk music. All singing is            
 unaccompanied. They first performed in
 Saint Andrews Church, Halton Holegate 
 and during the years have performed at
 many musical concerts at various      
 locations. The Singers- both male and 
 female- practise on average once a    
 week -on a Thursday evening at a      
 member's house in the village. For    
 concerts, the men wear dark suits and 
 sometimes a bow tie; the ladies- long 
 black skirts and white blouses.       
 There are three of the original       
 singers remaining in the group- and   
 numbers have varied from four to nine.
 The only qualification to join is an  
 adult singing voice.
