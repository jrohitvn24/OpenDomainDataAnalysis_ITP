		<content>When we get up we get dressed and have 
breakfast. Then my Dad goes to work at 
Salwick and my Mum takes us to school. 
School starts at 9.05. First we have an
assembly in the hall and then we go    
into our classroom to do our lessons.  
We have our dinner at school. The other
day it was fish and chips. At the end  
of school Mum comes to meet us and we  
go home for tea. If it is fine my      
sister and I play out on our bikes.    
When Dad comes home he has tea and we  
watch television. Mum hears us read    
and then I go to bed. On Sunday Mum    
cooks bacon and eggs for breakfast. My 
sister and I go to Sunday School in the
morning. After dinner we sometimes go  
to Stanley Park or on to the beach at  
Blackpool. One Sunday we went to Beacon
Fell Country Park in the car.
