		<title>13Travel around Snape,Yorks.</title>
		<content>   The only public transport out of the
 village is the bus which runs each    
 week to the market at Bedale on       
 Tuesdays and Ripon each Thursday.     
   Most households have a car, there   
 are 124 cars in Snape and 14 motor    
 cycles, used mainly for going to work 
 or shopping. Sixty-eight people leave 
 the village each morning to travel to 
 work in nearby towns and villages.    
   A coach collects secondary school   
 children who attend school in Bedale. 
 Another picks up students for college 
 in Harrogate, at a point near the     
 village.                              
   Snape is about 5 miles from the A1  
 at Leeming Bar and access to the      
 country's major road network. The     
 nearest railway station is 11 miles   
 away at Northallerton.
