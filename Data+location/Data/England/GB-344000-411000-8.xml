		<title>08HISTORY IN BURSCOUGH 2</title>
		<content>  The oldest church in Burscough is    
probably St Johns C E built in 1832. It
has a school (infants and juniors)     
built in 1836. Until Priory High       
Secondary School was built in the late 
1950's, St Johns also had senior       
classes.                               
  Burscough also has a Methodist Chapel
and school,about the same age as St    
Johns.                                 
  Thresher (wine merchants since 1847),
although not established locally, is   
the oldest firm in the village.        
  Other long established businesses    
include:Eastwoods who have sold and    
repaired footwear since 1890.          
  Many shops and businesses have closed
or changed, including storehouses and  
factories,2 of which made cakes.
