		<title>06OAKHILL SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Oakhill School was created in 1981  
 by the amalgamation of the village    
 schools of Alderton and Dumbleton when
 the number of pupils in each school   
 began to fall. So that each village   
 would still retain a school the infant
 classes are based at Dumbleton and the
 junior classes at Alderton. The       
 children are taken to the appropriate 
 site by bus.                          
   There are two full-time teachers at 
 each site and a part-time teacher who 
 spends some time at each. The         
 headteacher is based at Alderton but  
 spends some time each week at the     
 infant base.                          
   There are now 66 children at the    
 combined schools and this attempt to  
 save village schools has proved most  
 successful. It has been possible to   
 create support for one school within  
 the two villages.                     </content>
