		<content>  The small town of Berkeley lies about
 a mile and a half from the River      
 Severn. About 1500 people live here.  
 Some people work locally, at Berkeley 
 Nuclear Power Station, for example,   
 but others commute to Bristol, 20     
 miles away. The town is only 5 miles  
 from an access point to the M5        
 motorway. Recently a by-pass was      
 opened so that traffic to and from    
 Sharpness Docks on the Severn does not
 have to go through the town.          
  We have two tourist attractions in   
 the town: Berkeley Castle and the     
 Jenner Museum, as well as old houses  
 in the town centre. We also have      
 five antique shops. The bank is in a  
 building which used to be a women's   
 prison.
