   The population in our area is not   
 great, it covers mainly rural areas,  
 with small farms and two parts of the 
 villages of Bradford Peverell and     
 Charminster.                          
   There is only a very small part of  
 Dorchester which is included in our   
 area .It includes two estates they are
 Victoria park and Poundbury estate.   
 They have council houses built by the 
 council, most of them are terraced and
 semi-detached.                        
   Lately many people have bought these
 houses as we have changed the law to  
 encourage people to own their own     
 homes.                                
   In 1983 Dorchester had a population 
 of 14,185 ,Bradford Peverell has a    
 pop. of 359 and Charminster has a pop.
 of 2,023.The villagers commute to work</content>
