		<title>06FARMING PRACTICES OF AREA</title>
		<content>   The majority of farms in this area  
 have been split into small parcels of 
 land now grazed by horses and, due to 
 a high subsidy, sheep.                
   The largest holding is the 300 acre 
 Rystwood Farm which includes Lines    
 Farm and Upper Parrock.  This farm    
 ceased milk production in 1984 and now
 produces hay, barley and straw for    
 sale.  There is a small bought-in calf
 unit.                                 
   The area has one 90 acre dairy farm 
 and two farms of under 100 acres with 
 breeding ewes.  There are several     
 small holdings for fattening beef and 
 pigs and one deer farm.               
   There are no commercial orchards,   
 one pick-your-own soft fruit farm     
 combined with a herb &amp; shrub nursery. 
   The remainder of holdings are small 
 grass farms producing hay for the     
 large equine population.              </content>
