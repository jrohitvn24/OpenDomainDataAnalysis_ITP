		<content> Mr Alcorn owns and runs Tiptoe's      
 garage. He works with 1 mechanic and  
 has help with the paperwork. The      
 garage is open 6 days a week. He works
 a 60 hour week doing mechanical work  
 and body repairs and will also work on
 lawn mowers, bicycles and caravans.   
 The customers are mainly local but    
 some are tourists. Next door is the   
 shop and Post Office run by Mrs       
 Coombes. The shop sells cigarettes,   
 sweets, drink and stationery. The     
 Lockyer family run an animal feed and 
 riding equipment shop on the boundary 
 of Tiptoe and Wootton. They open 6    
 days a week. Their customers travel   
 from a wide area to the shop. There   
 are two churches in the Tiptoe area - 
 Baptist and Anglican. About 80 people 
 attend Mr McKenzie's Sunday service. A
 number of clubs use the church.
