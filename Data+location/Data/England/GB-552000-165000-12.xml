		<content>  hen the Dartford Tunnel (now part of 
the M25 London Orbital Motorway) was   
opened it started a great change in the
amount of traffic passing through      
Eynsford. The people of the village    
have been very upset because the heavy 
traffic has brought a great deal of    
noise, pollution and danger into their 
lives. Eynsford has many old ancient   
buildings which are gradually being    
spoilt. In 1979 a traffic count showed 
that nearly 10,000 vehicles which      
included 800 heavy lorries had used the
high street. Now they are working on   
the Swanley/Sevenoaks section of the   
London Orbital Motorway and when it is 
finished we all hope Eynsford village  
will be free of all the heavy lorries  
and trucks.
