		<title>16Low Harperley Farm.</title>
		<content> Low Harperley Farm is just inside the 
 area we had to study.It is a large    
 farm with a number of buildings.The   
 cows and sheep are reared for their   
 meat and the land is left for         
 grazing.Some of the fields are used   
 for crops mainly barley and hay.      
 The farmhouse is reached by  private  
 road and is surrounded by a large     
 stone wall.                           
 The farmhouse has three large stacks  
 of chimneys and an open barn for      
 storing the bales of hay.A large      
 cylinder stands nearby which is used  
 to store crops,it is called a         
 cropstore.Next to this is the covered 
 in barn where some of the animals stay
 during winter.Behind the barn are some
 old stables used as a store area and  
 these have small openings in the wall 
 for doves long ago.
