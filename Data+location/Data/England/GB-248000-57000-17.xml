		<title>17CHRIST CHURCH ESTOVER</title>
		<content>  The large housing estate of Estover  
 has a new Ecumenical church:- Christ  
 Church, Estover. THe building is      
 shared by different denominations who 
 do all they can together. Four        
 ministers, from the Church of England,
 the Methodist Church, the Baptist     
 Church and the Roman Catholic Church, 
 work together as a team.              
  A survey of the local population     
 showed that only 17% attend services  
 but approx. 81% believe in using the  
 church for Baptism, Marriage and      
 Funerals. The most common reasons     
 given for this were :-                
  (1) "It's traditional."              
  (2) "It's what the church is for."   
  (3) "It's the proper thing to do."   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
