		<content>{THE TRAIN CRASH.}26 Dec.1962, on      
 returning from a panto on a clear     
 frosty night, lights were shining     
 along the track.By the full moon we   
 investigated.One train was piled on   
 top of another.People hung from the   
 windows.Blood was flying.Lots of fire 
 and steam.When the bodies were taken  
 out they dumped them in a shed.A week 
 later lights were going off and on in 
 the shed. I went to have a look. I had
 just shut the door in the shed and    
 something put its hand on my shoulder.
 I turned round and realised I was face
 to face with a person that was dead!  
{PETTYWOOD COFFINS.}Two coffins were   
 found in the orchard.They belonged to 
 a witch and a pirate.There is a curse 
 on any one who disturbs them.They kill
 cows, damage tractors and machinery,  
 and throw bricks.If you dig them up it
 might happen to you.                  </content>
