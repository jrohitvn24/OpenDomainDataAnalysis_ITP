		<content> Our area is mainly agricultural with  
 some woodland.Most houses are         
 very old and most of the farms        
 existed for centuries.Most farms are  
 pastoral,raising sheep and cows for   
 meat and keeping dairy cows.On the    
 steeper slopes many of the farmers    
 have planted trees which are sold to a
 local sawmill.                        
 East and West Buckland are the only   
 villages in our area.They both have a 
 church.There is a store and a garage  
 in West Buckland,East Buckland has a  
 resturant but no shop.

 school with a prep department.The     
 School was founded in 1861.The school 
 has 450 pupils.The school has 35 acres
 of ground.
