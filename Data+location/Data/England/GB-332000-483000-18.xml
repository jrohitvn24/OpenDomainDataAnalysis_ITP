		<title>18The Lakeland Village.</title>
		<content>  This is a timeshare comlex situated  
 in and around an old industrial       
 estate.                               
  The Building which now houses the    
 White water Hotel was first built as a
 cotton mill. Since then it has been a 
 bobbin mill and Ultramarine works     
 before it was converted into a hotel  
 in 1984.                              
  In timeshare you buy a house for 80  
 years but you can only use it for     
 one week per year. Other weeks someone
 else uses it.                         
  The Lakeland Village Consists of:    
 Timeshare cottages.                   
 The Whitewater Hotel.                 
 Champneys-Sports complex.
