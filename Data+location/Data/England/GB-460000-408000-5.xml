		<content> A fragment of the original village of 
{Kirk Sandall}lies some way off near   
 the canal.It houses an ancient and    
 curious church. It is no longer used  
 for worship though the churchyard is  
 still used for burials.On rare        
 occasions the church is opened and the
 general upkeep and maintenance of the 
 church comes under the{redundant      
{churches}commission.Amongst several   
 unusual features the{herringbone work 
 in the nave is believed to be{Saxon   
 and the 16th.C.north chapel was built 
 by{William Rokeby,Archbishop of       
 Dublin,who was formerly a rector of   
 Kirk Sandall.In 1985 the white marble 
 monument to Rokeby was removed and the
 north window unbricked to allow the   
 first restoration work on this part of
 the church for 300 years.It has good  
 stained glass and a fine              
{pre-reformation wooden chancel screen.</content>
