		<title>17HALE HOT AIR BALLOON CLUB</title>
		<content>  My Dad is a hot air balloon pilot and
 sometimes I fly with him, but usually 
 I help to do retrieve.                
  Sometimes we lose the balloons but   
 mostly we manage to keep them in      
 sight. I help to roll up the envelope 
 and pack it into its bag.             
  The Club has got three balloons.     
 Superwasp has yellow and black        
 stripes, Ladybird has red and black   
 stripes and Glow-worm, which is a     
 five-man balloon, is yellow with blue 
 stripes at the bottom.                
  The balloons go up early in the      
 morning or late in the afternoon,     
 otherwise the thermals make it dan-   
 gerous, but sometimes we do tethered  
 flights at Shows for people to watch. 
  A little while ago two of our Dads   
 did a night flight in Glow-worm, from 
 Hale to Ross-on-Wye. It was about 80  
 miles and it took 3 hours,20 minutes. </content>
