		<title>14Traffic Survey</title>
		<content> On{Friday July 5th 1985}we did a      
{traffic survey}at the{London Colney   
{roundabout.}The{roads}leading off it  
 are the{A6 to London,}the{A405 from   
{Watford,}the{A405 to Hatfield}and     
 the{North}via the{A1, London Road (A6)
 from{St. Albans,}and{London Colney    
{High Street.}We only counted vehicles 
 coming off the A405 from the direction
 of Watford because it would be too    
 difficult to count all the traffic on 
 the roundabout. We chose this         
 direction because the{A405}comes from 
 the{Park Street roundabout}that       
 connects the{M10/M1}to St. Albans. We 
 went there at 1.30 pm and started     
 timing our survey at 1.50 pm. We      
 finished at 2.20 pm. We chose this    
 time because it is always busy at     
 lunch time and during the early       
 afternoon, particularly on Fridays.
