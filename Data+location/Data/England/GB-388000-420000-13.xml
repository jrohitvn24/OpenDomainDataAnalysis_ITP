		<title>13Shawforth Moorland Sports :1</title>
		<content>   The moors of Shawforth attract a    
 number of sports. Hang gliders hover  
 over Hades Hill, motor cycle trials   
 riders negotiate the difficult quarry 
 and moorland terrain and Land Rovers  
 lurch at seemingly impossible angles  
 in their attempt to out manoeuvre     
 their opponents in time trials events.
                                       
{Motor Cycle Trials}                   
   The first Red Rose National Motor   
 Cycle Trial was held in Shawforth in  
 1957 and in subsequent years up to    
 1966. After a lapse of 9 years it was 
 held in Shawforth again and has been  
 run there ever since. The event begins
 at Landgate, Shawforth and covers 18  
 miles of rugged moorland circuit and  
 quarries, stretching as far south as  
 Healey Corner, Whitworth. The event   
 attracts riders from as far away as   
 Grantham, Redruth and Birmingham.     </content>
