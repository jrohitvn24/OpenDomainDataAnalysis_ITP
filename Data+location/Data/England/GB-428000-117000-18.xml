		<title>18 Wellow's Timber Man</title>
		<content>The timber man buys the wood himself   
from an area stretching from Andover to
Bournemouth, other parts of Dorset, to 
the Isle of Wight.The timber man buys  
all species of wood apart from Corsican
Pine and Japanese Larch which are very 
soft woods.The base of the trees vary  
from three inches to six feet.No       
labourers are required,motor saws are  
used.There is no restriction on buying 
certain amounts of wood,the prices are 
low so little profit is made.No        
advertising is involved and people have
to pick up the supplies themselves.The 
sales depend largely on the weather.The
products are raspberry canes,swings,   
patio fencing materials,fire wood and  
stub posts.
