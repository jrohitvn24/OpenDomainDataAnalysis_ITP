		<content>  From a survey carried out in school, 
the most popular pets were cats and    
dogs. The most popular breed of dog was
the Border Collie. Other people keep   
farm animals as pets such as horses,   
hens, lambs and calves. Other pets     
which are popular are gerbils,         
goldfish,budgerigars, rabbits and      
tortoies. The majority of pets are fed 
on tinned food, some such as budgies   
eat dried food.                        
  I have a horse. In the winter I have 
to feed him on hay in the morning and  
night and in the afternoon he has hard 
feed called Coarse Horse. In the summer
he does not need any extra food because
the grass is enough for him to eat. In 
the winter I brush all the mud off his 
coat. When it is casting time I brush  
all his coat off.
