		<content>  The only large industrial concern is 
 the B.S.C. Wire Department,part of    
 their Stocksbridge works.             
  The department is owned by the       
 British Steel Corporation,but it is a 
 limited liability company.            
 Fortunately,it is,at the moment,  very
 profitable.It was built in 1963 when  
 the department consisted of 33        
 bays.Ten years later ,an extension    
 resulted in ten more functional bays  
 being opened.There are now 197 men and
 23 women employed there.              
 There are two sections to the         
 department:the first is for carbon and
 alloy steels,the second for stainless 
 steels.End products include welding   
 rods,wire and springs.
