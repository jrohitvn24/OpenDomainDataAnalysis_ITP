		<content>   The land in the east of the area is 
 part of the highland of the{Cartmel   
{Peninsula}reaching heights of 150 to  
 200m.The highest point is a small hill
 of 205m. which overlooks Bigland Tarn.
 To the west of the highland,there is a
 continuous slope following a north-   
 south fault scarp.                    
   The main rock type is{slate.}The    
 highland landscape undulates with     
 rocky outcrops and marshy hollows.The 
 poor drainage of the area results in  
 marshy areas and small ponds.One of   
 these is called "Bigland Tarn",and is 
 larger than the majority of the other 
 ponds.                                
   The land was probably{glaciated}at  
 one time when "plucking"and"abrasion" 
 by ice played a part in forming the   
 landscape leaving exposed,rocky       
 outcrops separated by marshy hollows  
 filled in with deposits.              </content>
