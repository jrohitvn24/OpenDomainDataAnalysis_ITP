		<title>12THE MULTI - ROUNDABOUT</title>
		<content> This original multi - roundabout was  
 designed to aid traffic flow. The     
 roundabout is the junction of six     
 roads of varying importance which link
 Hemel Hempstead with St. Albans,      
 Leighton Buzzard, Berkhamsted, Watford
 and the M1. The roundabout is designed
 with a large central area of grass,   
 and a small mini - rounabout at each  
 road end. The priciple  of traffic    
 flow is based on priority always being
 given to traffic coming from the      
 right. A driver approaching the main  
 roundabout need not necessarily go    
 round it. He can utilise the mini -   
 roundabout in order to go towards an  
 exit road on his right without having 
 to circuit the whole roundabout.      
 Traffic distance is cut down and flow 
 speeded up by the use of the little   
 satellite roundabouts.
