		<title>12BORDON TRADING ESTATE</title>
		<content> Bordon Trading Estate was established 
 in the early 1970s. Among the units   
 there will be found some fence made of
 railway track and sleepers; the old   
 station house and the old railway path
 plus some track. These remind us of   
 the Bordon to Bentley Railway which   
 was closed in 1968. Here are some of  
 the manufacturing units:
