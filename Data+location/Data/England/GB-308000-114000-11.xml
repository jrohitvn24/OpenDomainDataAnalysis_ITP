		<title>11CRICKET IN CULMSTOCK</title>
		<content> CRICKET is a popular sport played in  
 the Village and CULMSTOCK CRICKET CLUB
 has its Home Ground in this area - a  
 field given by a native of Culmstock  
 for the use of the Club.  There is a  
 Pavilion and the setting is ideal.    
 The Club, established around the      
 beginning of the century, lapsed for  
 a period but resumed just after the   
 Second World War and is still         
 flourishing and well supported.   As a
 Village team, one finds many sons and 
 grandsons follow in the footsteps of  
 earlier members.                      
 Highlight of the year is the          
 PRESIDENT'S MATCH when a team selected
 plays the Club team and villagers turn
 out in force.                         
 An ANNUAL DINNER DANCE is held when we
 hear of the Club's results for the    
 past year.                            
                                       </content>
