		<title>06HOUSING IN MARTON/NUNTHORPE</title>
		<content> There doesn't seem to be much else    
 in Nunthorpe and Marton apart from    
 housing. Most of the houses have been 
 built within the last 50 years, with  
 the older housing lining the main     
 roads of the area such as Stokesley   
 Rd., Gypsy Lane and Guisborough Rd.   
 Newer housing estates fill in the     
 spaces between the main roads.        
 A housing survey carried out by       
 the children of Captain Cook School   
 revealed that 61% of the houses in    
 Marton were built in the l970's, 22%  
 in the l960's and only 8% in the      
 1950's, thus showing the recent origin
 of most of the housing in the area.   
 The majority of dwellings in the area 
 are houses or bungalows. In Marton the
 survey revealed 95% houses, 4%        
 bungalows and only 1% flats.
