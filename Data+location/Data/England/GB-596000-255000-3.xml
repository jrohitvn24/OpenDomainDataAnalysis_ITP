		<title>03Buxhall - Farming: Cereals</title>
		<content> Cereals are the area's most important 
 crop, with{winter wheat}forming the   
 principle variety. Wheat is grown for 
 animal feed, export or milling        
 depending on quality. All these out-  
 lets are available in Suffolk with a  
 few feed and flour mills, and export  
 facilities at several East Anglian    
 ports. The heavy soil tends to ensure 
 good quality wheat with high yields   
 hence the popularity of the crop. One 
 farmer produces wheat for seed which  
 is sold to a local merchant for       
 dressing and resale.                  
{Barley}is mainly autumn sown for      
 animal feed but a significant amount  
 is sold locally for malting providing 
 the quality is satisfactory.          
 Most grain is stored on the farm if   
 not sold at harvest. Extra production 
 over recent years has resulted in many
 new stores being erected.             </content>
