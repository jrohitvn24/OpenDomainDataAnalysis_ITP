		<content> The area under study is policed by    
 members of the North Yorkshire Police 
 Force whose headquarters is at Newby  
 Wiske near Northallerton.             
 The local constables are under the    
 control of a Police Sergeant based in 
 Leyburn where there is a Police       
 Office. The Police Office is only     
 manned during day-time hours - help   
 after office hours is obtained by     
 contacting the Richmond Police        
 Station.                              
 The local police patrol the area in   
 cars.                                 
 There is a magistrates court which is 
 held in Thornborough Hall every second
 Friday during the year. The 'bench' is
 known as the 'Hang-West' bench.       
 Police use radio, telephone and       
 computer forms of communication in    
 their work.
