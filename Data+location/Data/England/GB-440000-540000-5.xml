		<title>05Where Peterlee People Work.</title>
		<content>{Peterlee}is a new town.It has a town  
 centre with large shops like{Fine Fare
 and{Woolworth,}as well as many smaller
 shops. To the North_east and South    
 west of{Peterlee,}industrial estates  
 are to be found. A lot of men and     
 women work in factories such as       
{Dewhursts}and{Linreed,}making clothes 
 for large chain stores like{Marks &amp;   
{Spencers.}Other factories include{DJB.
{Peterlee Glass Company, Fisher_Price  
 and{Tudor Crisps.}Some local men own  
 large lorries and go to{Horden beach  
 to collect sea coal. They can collect 
 it because the nearby pit tips its    
 waste coal in to the North sea. The   
 sea separates the coal from the stones
 and fine coal pieces are washed       
 ashore.{Peterlee's}population is now  
 23,000 and it has{17 schools. Peterlee
 also has it's own{Leisure Centre}where
 a variety of facilities are available.</content>
