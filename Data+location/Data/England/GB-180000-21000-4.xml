 There are many local people who have  
 Cornish names but are probably unaware
 of their meanings.  The language,     
 which is derived from Celtic, is being
 revived but few are fluent.           
 The following names are taken from    
 people in the school community:       
 Pascoe   = Easter child               
 Lugg     = calf                       
 Bray     = hill                       
 Caddy    = house surrounded by a hedge
 Bligh    = wolf                       
 Pengelly = end or head of copse       
 Pellow   = distant, far off           
 Gear     = hill fort                  
 Trewin   = fair                       
 Moyle    = bald or bare               
 Cara     = lover
