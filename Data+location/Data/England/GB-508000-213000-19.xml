		<content>   A study was done of a family who    
 had built a house and lived in it for 
 50 years.  Before this the family had 
 lived in the area and been bakers     
 since 1870.                           
   The owner of the house was a        
 carpenter in St Albans who also did   
 painting, engraving and enamel work in
 a studio in the garden.  During the   
 war they bred rabbits to provide the  
 family with food.                     
   The house was connected to the      
 electricity supply in 1939.  Until    
 1939 they had a chemical closet but   
 then built a cess tank, they were     
 connected to the mains water and      
 sewerage system in 1953.              
   Today they keep pet geese, ducks and
 rabbits.
