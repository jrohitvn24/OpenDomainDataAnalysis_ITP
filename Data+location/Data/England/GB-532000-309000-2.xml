		<content> In Gedney Hill there are quite a lot  
 of council houses.There are some new  
 houses and chalet bungalows etc..     
 Modern houses are made out of bricks. 
     Some people live in caravans while
 their houses are being built.There are
 still quite a lot of people living in 
 cottages that are part of a farm.Most 
 old cottages face the South.          
     Some old houses are being knocked 
 down and new ones are being built in  
 their place. In Gedney Hill there are 
 a lot more houses than bungalows.     
     Lots of people have gardens and   
 vegetable plots.Some people have a lot
 of trees growing in their front       
 gardens.People who have gardens have  
 bigger ones than people in town.      
     Some people in Gedney Hill have   
 static caravans down near the beach at
 Heacham,Hunstanton and Skegness.
