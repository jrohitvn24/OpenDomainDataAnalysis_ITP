		<content>{MARY MORELANDS GRAVE}__At the end of  
 the 17th Century a woman called Mary  
 Moreland lived in Bellerby with her   
 niece.Soon after her wedding her      
 husband died and Mary hanged herself. 
 So she had to be buried on the        
 boundary line of the village and      
 ignored. Whilst they were carrying her
 body out of the parish the ladder on  
 which she was being carried broke,40  
 metres short of the boundary in a     
 field called Marleymire on Richmond   
 Road.Since then the people of Bellerby
 and people of nearby villages have    
 disputed the boundary of Bellerby.    
  The place where she was buried is    
 marked on the Ordnance Survey map as  
 Mary Moreland's Well.
