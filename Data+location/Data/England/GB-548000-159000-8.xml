		<title>08A Small Museum in Halstead</title>
		<content>   Opposite our school is a{small      
{museum}and we went to it because this 
 year is the fortieth anniversary of   
 V.E. day. We saw a First World War    
 engine from a{Beardmore fighter.}Then 
 we saw a fire bomb which hit the      
 ground and started a fire.{In Halstead
{four V1 flying bombs and one V2       
{exploded.}We were also shown an Air   
 Raid Warden's hat.                    
   The owner of the exhibits started   
 his hobby when he was a child.A plane 
 crashed and he went out and collected 
 the pieces. We were told that on the  
{14th of March 1944, 1240 fire bombs   
{were dropped on Station Road,}and we  
 saw a chart with the bombs marked on  
 it. Halstead Place used to be a German
 Prisoner of War camp. At the end of   
 our visit we were allowed to go in the
{gun turret of a Whitley bomber.
