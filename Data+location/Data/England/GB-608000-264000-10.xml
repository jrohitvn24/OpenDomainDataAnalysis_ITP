Trip to Norwich.  You can hire coaches 
to take children on school visits and  
other things like that.  They also go  
abroad to other places in Europe.There 
is a big workshop and a special place  
outside where the buses and coaches are
washed.                                
Over the road from the school is a road
haulage company . It is where the old  
station used to be. The station was    
closed down in about 1956 and there are
only a few bits left.  The firm has 23 
lorries and they run on diesel and     
there are 34 trailers and a livestock  
lorry.  There is a workshop and an     
office and a place for washing down    
the vehicles.  The lorry drivers travel
all over the country and some of them  
go about 1200 miles a week.
