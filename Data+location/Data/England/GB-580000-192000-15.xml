       Pollution is made by factories  
 and people, people who throw litter   
 into streams and rivers, are gradually
 killing off all life in them.  The    
 River Thames was highly polluted      
 because of all the factories along    
 side of it.  Factories churn out waste
 in two forms, one is into the air, and
 the other and most serious one is into
 the water, it not only destroys life  
 but creates a disgusting smell and a  
 substance called "scum".  Petrol fumes
 from cars and other traffic pollute   
 the atmosphere, as do aerosole cans   
 which destroy the ozone layers.  But  
 now people are tring to clean the     
 atmosphere up, and over the last 50   
 years the River Thames has got a lot  
 cleaner and less polluted.
