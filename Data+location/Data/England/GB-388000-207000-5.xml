		<content> At The Camp there is a small          
 settlement which until recent years   
 boasted a post office,with stores,and 
 a pub.Many of the residents are       
 retired or work outside the area but  
 there ara several farms and           
 businesses-among them being a dealer  
 in vintage cars and motorbikes and a  
 riding stables.                       
 The dealer sells a lot of spare parts 
 abroad,especially to Japan.He finds   
 that the isolated position is not a   
 handicap because of the specialist    
 nature of his work.                   
 The riding stables are well placed to 
 offer some very attractive and varied 
 riding.There are at present 36 horses 
 and the stables provide riding lessons
 as well as day rides and week-long    
 pony treks (for details ring Miserden 
 219).
