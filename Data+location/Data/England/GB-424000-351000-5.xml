		<content> After eighteen years we still live at 
 Town End House owned by the Gells who 
 were one of the great Derbyshire      
 landowners in the 16th Century.Like   
 many others we were attracted by the  
 quiet and hilly landscape though work 
 is far away and it costs a great deal 
 to run a car ten miles.There are 17   
 households here.It is a popular place 
 to live now with the prospect of the  
 reservoir,though still empty with its 
 broken dam.It can be lonely place for 
 there is no seat in this shop,no      
 blacksmith's fire to sit by. There is 
 a library van,doctors and buses 3     
 times a week. After the wettest summer
 for years many are depressed but      
 hunger won't follow in our country.   
 Each tree dead of elm disease strikes 
 like the death of a friend.We welcome 
 the rooks, listen to the owls.A place 
 for a tranquil childhood.             </content>
