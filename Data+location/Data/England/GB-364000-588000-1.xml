		<content> The greater part of this "D-block" is 
 covered by the dark and deep waters of
 the Kielder Reservoir. On its shores  
 are found the plantations of the      
 Forestry Commission, broken only by   
 the rough grazing land around{Rushy   
{Knowe. }The new road, built when the  
 reservoir flooded the North Tyne      
 Valley above Yarrow, runs through the 
 western part of the "D-Block".        
 Along the western and southern banks  
 of the Kielder Reservoir, several     
 activity centres have been set up,    
 mainly catering for a variety of{water
{sports. }One of the most impressive of
 these is the{Hawkhirst Adventure Camp}
 which is to be found at GR36585893.   
 The eastern and northern sides of the 
 reservoir are known as the "Wild      
 Country",with no tourist developments 
 being undertaken there.
