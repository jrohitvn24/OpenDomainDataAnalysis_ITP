		<content>  The School is a Victorian building   
 constructed of local{carstone}and     
 opened in 1859. There have been       
 various more recent brick extensions  
 including inside toilets to replace   
 the outside ones which were in use    
 until about ten years ago. There is a 
 separate wooden classroom put up in   
 1950 and also one mobile classroom    
 which has made it possible to turn one
 of the original classrooms into a     
 hall.                                 
  There is a hard playground area with 
 climbing frames and the school has its
 own{playing field}which contains a    
 running track and pitches for football
 and rounders .                        
  The School's equipment includes      
 some indoor gym apparatus and three   
{computers.
