		<content> he dairy cows are milked twice a day. 
The milking machinery is advanced to   
that of other farms.The whole system is
run by a computer.The farm has two     
tanks for storing milk.Each day 11,00  
gallons of milk is collected from the  
farm.20 cows can be milked at a time   
while being fed.A unit is fitted onto  
the cows teats and the milk goes       
directly into tanks.The milk does not  
come into contact with the air so the  
risk of germs getting to it is 0.Above 
each cow is a digital metre which is   
linked to the computer.The machine is  
useful as it prints out information on 
the screen ie disease,special diets and
breeding programmes, as well as the    
amount of milk taken from each animal. 
This is shown on the main computer and 
cuts out all paperwork.Meanwhile the   
cows are fed on potatoes and molases a 
sugar extraction.                      </content>
