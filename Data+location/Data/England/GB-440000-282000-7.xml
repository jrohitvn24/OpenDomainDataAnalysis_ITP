		<content>  The school is a daily meeting place  
 for mums from{Barnacle,Ansty}and      
{Shilton.}It is near the church and    
 the vicar visits regularly.The pupils 
 go to the{old folks home}and the      
{Baptists'Chapel.}Occasionally meetings
 are held there, but there is no       
{Parents Teachers Association}.About 20
 years ago the parents donated money to
 build a small outdoor{swimming pool.  
  In{1977}it was recommended that the  
 school should be abolished,but there  
 was such an outcry, from the village ,
 that it was kept on.About{10 years ago
 the school took pupils from the ages  
{4_12}.There were{127}children in the  
 school then. But now children leave   
 the school at the age of 8 and go to  
{Wolvey School, 2 miles}away.After this
 most children go to{Nicholas          
{Chamberlaine Comprehensive School}in  
{Bedworth,5 miles}away.                </content>
