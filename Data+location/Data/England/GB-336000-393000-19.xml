 HOW LONG PEOPLE HAVE LIVED HERE IN    
 NORRIS GREEN.IT SHOWS THAT{75% OF THE 
{PEOPLE LIVING IN NORRIS GREEN HAVE    
{LIVED HERE FOR OVER 20 YEARS.}FOR OUR 
 NEXT QUESTION WE ASKED WHERE THEY HAD 
 MOVED FROM.WE GOT A LOT OF DIFFERENT  
 ANSWERS.THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED HERE
 FROM 0-10 YEARS MOSTLY MOVED FROM TOWN
 BUT OTHERS MOVED FROM PLACES LIKE     
 CROXTETH,FAZAKERLY AND COVENTRY.PEOPLE
 WHO HAVE LIVED FROM 10-19 YEARS IN    
 NORRIS GREEN CAME FROM HUYTON,WALTON, 
 KIRKBY AND MANCHESTER.THOSE WHO HAVE  
 LIVED HERE FOR OVER 20 YEARS HAVE COME
 FROM ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLACES.THE
