		<title>05HOLME LACY POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> Holme Lacy Post Office is{very small, 
 with enough space for about five      
 adults.   It is built onto the side of
 the house of the lady who runs it.    
{Trade is quite good,}even though Holme
 Lacy is very small.   The lady who    
 runs it sells{stamps, sweets,         
{cigarettes, ice cream and soft drinks,
 mainly in cans.   She used only to    
 sell stamps, but the{old village shop 
 closed in 1975 so now she has the     
 other things.   There is an old letter
 box at the gate to the office.   There
 is a{notice board}for the village, it 
 costs 5 pence to put a notice on it.  
 She sells a lot of pop and sweets, and
 some cigarettes, to the students at   
 the College of Agriculture.   A lot of
 customers stop for a chat, so all the 
{news of the village}can be passed on  
 or learned over the counter.
