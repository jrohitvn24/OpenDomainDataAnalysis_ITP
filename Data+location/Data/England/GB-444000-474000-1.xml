		<title>01GEOGRAPHY OF SESSAY</title>
		<content> This section lies in the southern part
 of the Vale of Mowbray which in its   
 turn is part of the{PLAIN or VALE OF  
{YORK.}After the Ice Age it was under  
 water from melting glaciers hence the 
 deposits of sand over clay and shale. 
 This eventually drained away leaving  
 the ground mainly 100 feet above sea  
 level and still inclined to flood. In 
 the past this was forest and bog.     
                                       
                                       
{DRAINAGE}is still a problem and though
 very good farmland any part left      
 uncultivated would rapidly revert to  
 hawthorn dogrose and elder; eventually
 to forest trees: oak ash sycamore     
 field maple and birch. All of these   
 grow freely from seed. Drainage is    
 from field-drains to the becks and    
 then to the River Swale.
