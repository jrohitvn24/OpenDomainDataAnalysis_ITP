		<title>15Fishing on the River Coquet.</title>
		<content> Fishing is a popular pastime on the   
 River Coquet between Guyzance and     
 Warkworth.Anglers exercise their      
 expertise to catch salmon and         
 trout.The salmon season lasts from    
 February until October and the trout  
 season from mid March until September.
 Traditionally,the first salmon caught 
 is presented to the local landowner,  
 His Grace The Duke of Northumberland. 
 Anglers use various bait but the most 
 popular are artificial flies made from
 feathers and hair,particular          
 favourites are Greenwells Glory and   
 Partridge and Orange. Many anglers    
 prefer to tie their own flies butthey 
 can be bought commercially.Fine       
 quality fishing tackle is manufactured
 locally by Hardy Bros.in nearby       
 Alnwick.Bailiffs are employed to      
 monitor fish stock and to prevent     
 illegal fishing.                      </content>
