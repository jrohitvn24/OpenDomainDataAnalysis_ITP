		<title>05FARMING IN 1885</title>
		<content>  In the early days of farming there   
 was no machinery as we have today.    
 When it came to ploughing they did not
 have our modern day machinery, instead
 they had 2 to 4 strong horses who     
 would be fastened to the plough and   
 then, with a man walking behind       
 holding on to a tiller, would start   
 off at a reasonable speed and walk up 
 and down making furrows all over the  
 field. After this was done they would 
 be ready for planting. This job would 
 take at least a full day or even      
 longer if it was really hot. The      
 planting would be done by hand and    
 would take at least from dawn one day 
 to dawn the next.                     
  Nowadays we have machinery for       
 spreading seeds and a more advanced   
 way of ploughing. With a tractor a    
 field could be ploughed in half a day
