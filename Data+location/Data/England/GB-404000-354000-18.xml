		<title>18Butterton lorry-driver's day</title>
		<content>     My dad is a long distance lorry   
driver.  He gets up sometimes as early 
as 4.30a.m. but rarely after 9a.m.  For
breakfast he usually has sandwiches and
a cup of tea.  He drives an articulated
lorry transporting massive stone pipes 
from our house to places like          
Manchester, Newmarket, London, Mull and
even up to Scotland.                   
     At dinner-time he usually buys a  
paper and something to drink to go with
his sandwiches.                        
     When he gets to his destination he
has a word with the workers who unload 
the lorry with cranes, diggers, etc.   
He takes his load anywhere, to housing 
estates, farms, children's homes,      
racing studs and many other places.    
     When the lorry has been unloaded  
he comes home for his tea.  He then    
waters the hanging basket before       
watching television.                   </content>
