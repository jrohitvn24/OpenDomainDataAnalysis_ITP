		<title>14WORCESTER'S NEW BRIDGE.</title>
		<content>     This bridge, was opened in        
 September 1984. This bridge is about a
 third of a mile long. It stretches    
 over the river Severn and a large     
 amount of farmland and links up with  
 the road from Worcester to Malvern.   
   The bridge has been built about     
 three miles from the centre of        
 Worcester in an attempt to divert     
 unnecessary traffic away from the     
 city. There are further plans to make 
 a bypass from the bridge to the M5,   
 but this scheme is unable to go ahead 
 until a farmer sells a part of his    
 land which is in the way of the       
 bypass.                               
   One result of all this confusion is 
 that so far the bridge is not being   
 used as much as was expected.         
   Another interesting feature about   
 the bridge is that it overlooks the   
 site of the Battle of Worcester.      </content>
