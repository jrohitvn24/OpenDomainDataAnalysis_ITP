		<title>11 A DENTON CRAFT ENTERPRISE</title>
		<content>                                       
 We moved to Denton eight years ago    
having bought a derelict old           
farmhouse needing the kind of          
modernisation that involves blocking   
up the holes in roof and walls.        
We enjoyed making things and looked    
forward to restoring it to its         
former splendour despite having a      
toddler and a three weeks old baby.    
Recently the house was finished and I  
found the time to learn several new    
crafts,purely as a relaxing hobby.     
With my three children at school,      
however,I decided to turn my           
interests into a small business.       
I coined the name,"Suzybee Crafts",and 
decided to sell my work through the    
party system offering as much choice as
a small craft shop.(Cont'd on P.12)
