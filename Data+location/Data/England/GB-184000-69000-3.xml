		<title>03EMPLOYMENT IN PENROSE</title>
		<content>{PENROSE}was the first stop, there we  
 found three people who were employed. 
 Their jobs were:an Architect, a       
 Postman and Store manager. Mrs Miller 
 of Treburrick was the first employed  
 person that I met.She is employed by  
 the local strawberry farm.Her husband 
 is employed by E.C.L.P. Mrs.Miller's  
 next-door neighbour's husband is a    
 Quantity Surveyor.Then I bumped into  
 an ex-Railway man who couldn't tell us
 much.Then I met a Milkman who works   
 for Richards Dairies.There appear to  
 be more RAF children than Farmer's    
 children.Here are four other types of 
 job:an U.S.Pilot, a Vet and a Film    
 star and a Newsagent owner.At         
 Porthcothan there are two Life        
 guards.Both work on bad days.The times
 they work from are 10.00-18.00 and    
 from May to September.
