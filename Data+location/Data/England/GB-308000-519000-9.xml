		<title>09LAMPLUGH POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> On 3.1.85 the Post Office moved to    
 High Mill Gill Head. The services are 
 selling Stamps, Postal Orders, Premium
 Bonds, Saving Certificates, Dog       
 Licences, Giros, National Insurance,  
 Pensions, Family Allowances and       
 Savings Bank.                         
 There are four post boxes in Lamplugh 
 and three postmen that empty them     
 twice a day. The Post Office is open  
 three days a week. The busiest time of
 year is Xmas as they close, so        
 everyone rushes to send cards and     
 parcels. The Post Office is open 9am  
 till 4pm without a break. The 1st     
 class stamp costs 17p and 2nd costs   
 13p. If anybody wanted to take up a   
 Post Office they would have to sign a 
 letter of secrecy and aren't allowed  
 to show anyone confidential details or
 they will lose their job.
