		<title>17Two Schools Get Together</title>
		<content>    Because of falling rolls at both   
 schools,the twenty-four junior aged   
 pupils from Taddington and Ashford    
 schools have met for Environmental    
 Studies at Monsal Dale where their    
 parish boundaries meet.With specialist
 help of graduates on the temporary    
 staff of the Peak National Park Board 
 the rambles included river dipping in 
 the R.Wye,as well as other ecological 
 aspects.A seconded headteacher helped 
 with bird identification and arranged 
 for the firing of clay models made as 
 a result of the three dale meetings.A 
 walk along the Monsal Trail-converted 
 from the former railway track-included
 looking at past mining activities and 
 led to a joint visit to the Leadmining
 Museum and the Nestus Mine at Matlock 
 Bath.Picnics,sketching on the river   
 bank,and a P.E.lesson have also been  
 among the much enjoyed activities.    </content>
