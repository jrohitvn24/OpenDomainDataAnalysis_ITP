		<title>12DR. BORROW AND DENTAMILK</title>
		<content> Doctor Borrow began to set up the     
 Borrow Dental Milk Foundation in 1970.
 The offices and dairies are at Padnell
 Grange, Cowplain. In Hampshire        
 Dentalmilk can be delivered to the    
 doorstep. Dentamilk is milk with      
 fluoride added. The idea is to reduce 
 tooth decay. A Hungarian Dental       
 Research team concluded that when     
 children of three years upwards drink 
 Dentamilk it is possible to reduce    
 dental decay by 74%. The Louisiana    
 State University awarded Dr. Borrow an
 Honorary Doctorate for his work in    
 promoting Dentamilk. Two of the       
 foundation's aims are to encourage the
 study and research in fluoridation of 
 milk and to employ medical and dental 
 specialists and other professionals   
 and technical staff.
