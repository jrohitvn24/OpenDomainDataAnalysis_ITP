		<title>03Local History at Bromp on S</title>
		<content>  At Catterick racecourse there is an  
 old{Roman wall,}the remains of a camp 
 near a ford over the Swale.           
  The first{Domesday Book}mentions the 
 Anglo-Saxon settlement of 'Brumpton'  
 from 'broom' meaning shrub and 'tun'  
 for a farmstead or village.           
  There has been a{bridge}over the     
 Swale at Catterick certainly since the
 C15th as a hotel was built then.      
  As Brompton lies near the A1 it      
 became part of the Richmond to        
 Lancaster{Turnpike}in 1751.           
  Records show that{craftsmen}such as  
 blacksmiths, millers,curriers and     
 wheelwrights worked here.             
  There was a brewery here until 1956  
 and a tannery.                        
  There was also a{railway}through the 
 village to join the main East Coast   
 line near Darlington until it was     
 closed about 17 years ago.            </content>
