		<title>14Bus Services In Sidcup.</title>
		<content>   The main vehicle on yhe road that   
 you pay to travel on is the bus. There
 are three different types of buses:   
 red buses, greenline buses and the    
 National buses.                       
{  Greenline and National buses}provide
 transport for long journeys such as up
 to London or to other parts of the    
 country.                              
  {Red buses}provide transport for     
{short journeys in the local area}and  
 is thus a{more frequent service.}Many 
 children travel by bus to school and  
 buisness men often travel to work on  
 them during the rush hour. This leaves
 only shoppers or elderly people using 
 the buses during the day. Shoppers    
 provide the bulk of the travellers on 
 Saturdays. The price charged depends  
 on the distance travelled, but passes 
 can be bought for a single week, month
 or even year.                         </content>
