		<content>    Within our area is Woad Lane, Long 
 Sutton. We believe that woad was grown
 and processed down this lane. Woad is 
 the name of the dye or mordant and is 
 also given to the plant from which the
 dye is taken. Isatis tinctoria (the   
 woad plant) is a biennial herb, that  
 is a herb that has only leaves in the 
 first year of growth and then flowers 
 and seeds in the second year, when it 
 grows from 60 cms to 1.5 m high. The  
 plant produces a blue dye, although a 
 fresh bath would give a deep black    
 shade. Cloth was dyed green in the    
 Middle Ages by  dyeing it blue and    
 then afterwards yellow with weld,     
 another dye obtained from a plant. A  
 lady told our teacher that from       
 photographs she had seen she thinks   
 the woadmill was situated just east of
 Hovell's pit, Woad Lane.
