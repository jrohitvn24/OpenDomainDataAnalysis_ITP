		<content> Mr. Stock of Wardens Lodge farms about
 200 acres near Willingale.   He has   
 been farming for about 60 years and   
 sees  the loss of animals on the farm 
 as the biggest change in the last ten 
 years.   Many of the unused farm      
 buildings around the farmhouse are    
 evidence of the change from dairy to  
 mixed farming.   He now breeds sheep  
 (Dorset Downs) which he sells for     
 meat.   He grows wheat, barley, rape  
 and potatoes.   The farmhouse was     
 built around l850 and is a typical    
 building of this time having a        
 "marbled" pillared porch over the     
 front door.                           
 He has six tractors, one combine, one 
 corn drill. 3 cultivators, 1 plough   
 and a hay baler.   The Stocks do not  
 grow vegetables in their garden, only 
 flowers.                              
                                       </content>
