		<content>  In our area most farmers{farm}on a   
{ part time}basis.Some have some cows &amp;
  sheep etc. but also have a job.I went
  to a farm called{Pasture House.}The  
 farmer bred prize{bulls}as a full time
 living.We went on the moors in his    
 landrover to see his prize Charolais  
 cows.They were pure white there were  
  cows &amp; calves.Then he took us back   
 down the moors to the farm.It was a   
 bumpy ride and I got squashed but I   
 put up with it.When we got back to the
 farm the farmer showed us two{Jersey} 
 cows.They were different shades of    
 brown,dark brown &amp; light brown.One was
 called Nelly and the other was called 
 Nora.Then we went to see some         
 calves.We had a chance to feed the    
 calves.It was fun.                    
 We went to see a new born Charolais   
 calf which we named{Adele.
