		<title>17DRILLING FOR OIL</title>
		<content>  A million pound gamble,drilling for  
 oil in the Weeton-Harewood area was   
 approved in July 1983 and a licence   
 issued lasting for 30 years.The chance
 of finding oil in sufficient quantity 
 for economic use was 1 in 16.         
  The depth of drilling was 8500 feet. 
 The site was little larger than a     
 football field.The rig towered upwards
 for 135 feet.The drilling continued   
 for 4 to 5 months.15 men were         
 employed on a shift basis;5 men for   
 each 12 hours,working round the clock,
 under floodlights at night.           
  The residents of neighbouring        
 villages were worried about the noise,
 the heavy traffic along the country   
 lanes and the possible disfigurement  
 of the beautiful landscape.           
  The hoped-for 10 million barrels of  
 oil were not available.Subsequently no
 more drilling will take place.        </content>
