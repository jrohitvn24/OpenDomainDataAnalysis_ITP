		<content>{We studied Shirtcliff Woods where     
 we saw plenty of plants and wildlife. 
 The birds we saw were sparrows,       
 blackbirds,thrushes,magpies and jays. 
 We saw a badger set and rat holes     
 but no sign of life of either.        
 Wildlife is being disturbed by        
 vandals , motorbikes and the public   
 think it's a nice place to take the   
 dog for a walk and for some fresh air.
 Horses are kept in small fields fenced
 in by barbed wire which we think is   
 cruel.Farmers grow grass which will   
 eventually be fed to the horses.      
 The community is peaceful and very    
 clean.The neighbours are very         
 friendly.Some trees which we saw were 
 silver birch,oak,chestnut and fir.
