		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MATTHEW</title>
		<content> I wake up at 7.30, throw back my      
 sheets, climb out of my bunk bed, take
 off my cotton pyjamas and get dressed.
 I wear cords which are my favourite   
 sort of trousers.                     
 I help Mum by laying the breakfast    
 table. Meanwhile Mum does the animals 
 because Dad is away working on a North
 Sea oilrig and offshore drilling.     
 For breakfast I have cornflakes and   
 oats. We have our own milk because we 
 keep two nanny goats, Abigail and     
 Chloe. After breakfast I clear the    
 table and put the food back in the    
 larder or the fridge.                 
 Our house is quite old with an old    
 Rayburn stove fixed in the wall.      
 I get washed next and ready for       
 school.  I cycle to school on my      
 racing bike.  When I arrive there's   
 still five minutes before the bell.
