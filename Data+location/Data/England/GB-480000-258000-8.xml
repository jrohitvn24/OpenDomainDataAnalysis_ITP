		<title>08LITTLE HOUGHTON ..20th Cent.</title>
		<content>   In agricultural terms at least very 
 little appears to have changed in the 
 last 86 years.                        
   However{Little Houghton}has one     
 important claim to fame. In 1937 a    
 French company was looking for a U.K. 
 base; the old watermill nestling by   
 the Nene seemed ideal for the         
 manufacture of{gelatine.}After all    
 there was abundant water and clean    
 air. Unfortunately the works closed in
 1980 and the building is now being    
 demolished. Not far away 2 acres of   
 glass deflect the sun's rays onto     
{cacti}being prepared for the wholesale
 market.                               
   In 1979 over{50 years of campaigning
 reached a successful conclusion when  
 the by-pass was built;{2 miles long}at
 a cost of{Â£1,500,000.}The road has cut
 vehicles from{6000 each day to 60}and 
 clocks no longer fall to the floor.   </content>
