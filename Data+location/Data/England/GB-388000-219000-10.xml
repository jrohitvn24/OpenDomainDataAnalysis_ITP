		<title>10LEISURE IN HATHERLEY</title>
		<content>  There are few leisure facilities in  
 Hatherley considering the number of   
 young people in the area.{Caernarvon  
{Park}is a flat open space with a few  
 swings and a roundabout,a large{riding
{school}is nearby as is a{B.M.X. cycle 
{track.}There are also{Scout}and{Guide 
 groups and a{Church youth section.    
  Of a sample of Lakeside children     
 about two thirds used the{park        
 regularly,about a fifth used the{cycle
{track}and a very small fraction the   
{riding school.                        
  We asked what extra items people     
 would like in the area.A very large   
 number wanted a{swimming pool,        
 Cheltenham only has one indoor and one
 outdoor pool.Other requests were for  
 more cycle tracks,better playground   
 equipment,hard courts for tennis and  
 netball,and a big sand pit!
