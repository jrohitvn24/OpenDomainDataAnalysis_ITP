		<content> Copmanthorpe has a  village trust,it  
 has set itself the task of watching   
 over the preservation of the village  
 since 1970.A booklet has been written 
 by one of its members Jean Johnson,the
 Honary Secretary of the trust, detail_
 ing the history of the village.In it  
 she tells us that Copmanthorpe derived
 its name possibly from the Viking word
 "thorpe"meaning an outlying settlement
 .Copmanthorpe means the merchant's    
 settlement and it was possibly a rest_
 ing place or trading place on the road
 to York.There is a Roman road which   
 runs along what is now Top Lane.This  
 was part of a Roman Highway which ran 
 from York to Tadcaster eventually     
 joining the main Roman road from      
 Lincoln. (Continued on page 6).
