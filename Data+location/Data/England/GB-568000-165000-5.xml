		<content> Dr Shroff lives in Halling. He has    
 about 3500 patients, 2000 of whom live
 in Cuxton. His surgery in Cuxton is a 
 modern building, opened in 1972. He   
 sees about 250 patients a week, mostly
 with coughs, colds and sore throats.  
 Because Cuxton is in a rural area most
 people are quite healthy but hay fever
 is an increasing problem. Fortunately 
 drug taking and glue sniffing do not  
 appear to be problems. The birth rate 
 is steady, about 50 babies being born 
 in a year. The average life span is   
 between 65 and 70 years, heart attacks
 causing most deaths. Stress conditions
 caused largely by unemployment are    
 becoming more common. Medicines are   
 dispensed at the surgery because there
 is no chemist's shop in the village.
