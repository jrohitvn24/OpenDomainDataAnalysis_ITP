		<content>Eltham is fortunate in having not only 
leisure facilities of its own,but in   
being surrounded by places equally well
catered for.People in Eltham often     
venture into surrounding districts for 
such things as swimming pools/Aquazooms
,ice skating,fairs etc.Also,with easy  
access into the centre of London,we    
have the choice of everything offered  
there such as restaurants,theatres,    
concerts and exhibitions.Eltham itself 
is able to offer youth centres,a cinema
,libraries,tennis courts,two swimming  
pools,extensive woods and parks,and a  
high street full of good shops.
