		<title>07SIR THOMAS TRESHAM</title>
		<content>  Sir Thomas Tresham (1545-1605) was an
 original and talented man. The 'New   
 Bield',as it was sometimes called, was
 not his only building, but it is in   
 many ways his most interesting one.   
  He was a very religious Roman        
 Catholic at the time of the           
 Elizabethan persecution, and all his  
 creations were to do with religion.The
 theme of the New Bield was the passion
 and death of our lord.His son was     
 involved in the Gunpowder plot and    
 died in the Tower of London.His second
 son died shortly after his own death  
 in 1605.                              
                                       
 There is a college in Corby and       
 Kettering named Tresham College.
