		<title>07CLEMENTS FARM, BRICKENDON</title>
		<content> A typical dairy farm of the area,     
 Clements Farm,approx. 350 acres,      
 has been farmed by the Vigus family   
 for over 50 years. Wheat,barley &amp; oats
 are grown in rotation on arable land  
 using seasonal contracted labour.     
 A herd of 100 Friesian cows,well known
 for their large milk yield,are tended 
 by the herdsman who lives in one of   
 the farm cottages,and has worked at   
 the farm for 19 years. For him a      
 working week is approx.50 hours and   
 milking takes about 3 hours a day and 
 is done by machine. The cattle are    
 freeze branded using liquid nitrogen  
 to cool the irons. About six weeks    
 later white hairs grow on the beasts' 
 black rumps and the numbers branded   
 are plainly visible across the fields!
 A great improvement to the old hot    
 iron method!
