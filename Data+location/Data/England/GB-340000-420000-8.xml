    Cereal crops are also grown mainly 
to feed horses, which are numerous in  
this area. Amongst the fields and      
glasshouses are small reservoirs made  
by the growers for irrigating their    
crops, both indoor and out.            
    Most of the farms are arable,      
altough one or two keep livestock,     
specifically cattle,goats,pigs, and    
hens.                                  
    The majority of farms and          
smallholdings have dwelling houses on  
the actual property. These are either  
modernised farmhouses, or have been    
privately built to the owners'         
specifications. Some of the larger     
businesses employ foreign staff, who   
live in residential caravans.
