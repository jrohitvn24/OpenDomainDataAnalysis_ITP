		<content> Efforts to re-establish the village   
 pond have been a recent priority with 
 the Village Association.Specialist    
 clearing and draining are now         
 considered essential,after voluntary  
 efforts to keep the pond in good      
 condition have failed.The parish      
 council are pursuing the establishment
 of title to the land,in order that a  
 grant toward the cost of this work may
 be applied for.                       
 There being no doctor's surgery in the
 village is considered to be a great   
 disadvantage,which may result in call-
 outs for home visits being more       
 frequent.                             
 The lack of main banking facilities   
 also causes some comment,a journey to 
 Romsey being necessary.               
 A poor bus service,just 3 journeys a  
 day,is the result of the axeing of an 
 un-economic service.                  </content>
