		<content> The defined area has changed little   
 over the centuries.The blue/grey marls
 which form the lowest part of the lias
 clays of the Jurassic group have      
 formed the pattern of low hills       
 between the{Cotswolds}and their       
 outlier{Bredon Hill}in the broad area 
 known as the{Severn}plain.The clays   
 have resulted in the medieval field   
 patterns being undisturbed by modern  
 ploughs.Sheep have grazed for         
 centuries on the high ridges and deep 
 furrows which are clearly visible.    
 The settlement pattern is of scattered
 villages,(largest consisting of 78    
 dwellings)which are small and         
 irregular in form and a few isolated  
 farms.
