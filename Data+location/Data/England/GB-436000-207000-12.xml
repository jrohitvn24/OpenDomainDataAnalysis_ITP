		<title>12The Farm Museum</title>
		<content> The farm was built in the original    
Domesday period.It was probably built  
on a moated site, in a figure of       
eight, in the eleventh century. It     
survived for about a hundred years. It 
was rebuilt nearby in the thirteenth   
century. The kitchen and dairy         
originate from that time. The kitchen  
used to be the great hall and has      
lancet windows. At that time the owners
owned 300 acres. It was a mixed farm   
with mostly cattle and sheep. It is    
now a farm museum. It is an active farm
with some animals and crops and uses   
methods used in the Edwardian period   
such as threshing. They have regular   
demonstrations of lacemaking, farmhouse
cooking, milking cows and goats, sheep 
dipping, blacksmithing, steam engines, 
horse grooming, horse and  cart rides, 
donkey rides, butter-making and many   
other ancient crafts.                  </content>
