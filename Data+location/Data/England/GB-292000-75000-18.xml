		<title>18Life Styles</title>
		<content> The people in this block have         
 comfortable life styles. Most own     
 their                                 
 own cars and about half their own     
 house or flat. Denim jeans seem to be 
 the most popular wear by men and women
 for casual occasions, with large      
 floppy blouses or shirts. For formal  
 parties or dinners pretty blouses and 
 long skirts seem to be the norm for   
 girls. The younger generation have    
 plenty of discos and dances to enjoy, 
 a local hotel has concerts by various 
 groups throughout the year. There is  
 only one betting shop in Dawlish,     
 mostly to do with horse racing. Card  
 bingo is played in several clubs.
