		<title>18Manor Farm, North Boarhunt</title>
		<content>{Manor Farm}was more than likely owned 
 by a Knight, which at the time was a  
 manor and not a farm. The farm itself 
 has been in the present family since  
 l92l and has been handed down through 
 the generations. The farm deals with  
 beef cattle, wheat and potatoes.      
{The present farmhouse is about        
{5OO years old.}The dull, red brick    
 building is large with heavy oak beams
 and flagstone floors. The house has a 
 Norman arch, baking ovens and a dairy.
{There is a water well in the hall     
{which is now covered over.            
 With the farm are five old barns and  
 three new iron ones. There is an old  
 granary and a small pond.             
 The farm became linked with Southwick 
 when{William of Wykeham, as Bishop of 
{Winchester}received the property for  
{Southwick Priory in l367.
