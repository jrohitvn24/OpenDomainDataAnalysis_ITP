		<content>  The{Jubilee Clock}was erected in     
 1887.It commemorates the{Golden       
{Jubilee}of {Queen Victoria}.The clock 
 was a gift from{Sir Henry Edwards},a  
 local benefactor.                     
  The clock is made from cast iron on a
 Portland Stone base.It has four       
 dials,four busts of Queen Victoria and
 four town crests.                     
  The clock is used by people to set   
 their watches.It is also used as a    
 meeting place.Every two weeks or so a 
 band plays nearby,often the Salvation 
 Army Band.                            
  During the months of                 
 June,July,August,September and at     
 Christmas,the clock is lit by 176     
 decorative light bulbs.This makes the 
 clock the prominent landmark of       
 Weymouth Esplanade by day and night.  
                        Richard Turner.
