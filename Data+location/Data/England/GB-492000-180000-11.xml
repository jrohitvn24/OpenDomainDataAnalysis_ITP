		<title>11MARS FACTORY</title>
		<content>   In 1932, a young American, Forrest  
 E. Mars, arrived in Europe.He had some
 capital but, even more important,he   
 had the recipe for a new chocolate bar
 which he had developed with his       
 father.Forrest Mars decided that      
 Slough was the best place to set up   
 business.                             
   The Mars bar was very successful and
 by the end of the year over one       
 hundred people worked in the Dorset   
 Avenue factory. At the start it was   
 not unusual to work eighty hours a    
 week.You needed no qualifications,but 
 you had to be over seventeen.         
   Mars today makes over 20 brands of  
 sweets.Approximately 3000 people work 
 for Mars.Mars is the largest chocolate
 factory in th U.K. and 1 of the 3 top 
 confectionary companies.It has earned 
 Slough the title of{"The Confectionary
{Capital of Europe". }                 </content>
