		<title>07Problem Of Footpaths.</title>
		<content>                                       
   There are a number of footpaths     
around the village of Little Harrowden 
and access to them has led to arguments
between the County Ramblers Association
and local farmers.This was the topic of
a Regional television programme.Local  
farmers have ploughed up the fields    
across footpaths and planted crops.    
People wishing to use the footpaths    
have to walk waist high, through fields
of oil seed rape and wheat.One rambler 
interviewed, claimed he had to dress up
in full waterproof clothing in order to
cross one particular field. Complaints 
were also made about ditches at the    
edge of fields across public footpaths 
which were difficult to negotiate.     
   A local farmer who has planted such 
a crop has driven in wooden posts above
the height of the crop to mark the     
route of the footpath.                 </content>
