		<title>09A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JOANNA.</title>
		<content> My name is Joanna and I am ten years  
old.On wednesdays I normaly get up at  
half past seven when I hear the milking
machine,which means dad is outside     
milking the cows,or mum awakes me.so   
we all get up and have breakfast like  
cornflakes,egg and bacon,toast and a   
cup of tea.Then my mother takes my 3   
brothers and me to school and on the   
way we pick up a friend,Paul.We drop   
Francis and Paul at Cotton College     
before mum takes George,Michael and    
myself to Faber school on her way to   
work.The first lesson is table test in 
which I normaly get 33 out of forty.At 
half past three we go home.After tea I 
do any homework that needs to be done. 
At half past six we all go swimming at 
Waterhouses.We get home at eight p.m.  
then it is time to get ready for bed.  
Sometimes I may watch television or    
read a book before going to sleep.     </content>
