		<title>16MARKET RASEN MARKET PLACE</title>
		<content> The market began in about 1220 and up 
 until the 20th. century the           
 agricultural nature of the area       
 dictated the flavour of the market. In
 the 15th. and 16th. centuries sheep   
 dominated proceedings. The market     
 naturally attracted other trade       
 including the sale of hides and       
 travelling tailors tinkers etc. In the
 20th. century the nature of the market
 has become more general as social     
 habits and prosperity have altered.   
 The Market Place itself retains much  
 of its character although the town    
 hall and pump were removed (the latter
 is to restored to its former position)
 A covered area next to the church     
 provides produce auction facilities   
 each Tuesday and other stalls are also
 present.The Market Place-the focus of 
 the town.The livestock market is next 
 to the rly.station(Wed.)mostly sheep. </content>
