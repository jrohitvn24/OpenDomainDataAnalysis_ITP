		<title>19ST.ANDREW'S CHURCH &amp; SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{Andrew Leslie}had to build a{school}  
 for his workers' children to give them
 an education.In the{early 1880's}he   
 built a church and dedicated it to his
 wife, Margaret.It was named after the 
 patron saint of Scotland,Andrew.He    
 died in 1894,six years after his      
 wife;the family kept the church going.
 They closed the church down,but they  
 could not demolish it because it was a
{listed building}because of its{Gothic 
 architecture.About one year ago they  
 started modernising it because it had 
 been vandalised.They could not afford 
 to heat the church,so they put a false
 ceiling in.Then they decided to make  
 the{church}and school into{workshops  
 and offices.They expect the           
 alterations to be finished within the 
 next six months.
