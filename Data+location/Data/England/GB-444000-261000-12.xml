		<title>12HOMELIFE - SUNDAY</title>
		<content> Some people go to church on Sunday    
 morning. On Saint George's Day the    
 Brownies did a play in the church     
 about Saint George. We pretended to be
 a dragon by putting two curtains over 
 us. The dragon was going to eat the   
 princess but Saint George killed the  
 dragon. I enjoyed it when George      
 killed the dragon because we all fell 
 over and giggled.                     
 The Sunday before last we had beef,   
 peas, chips and yorkshire pudding for 
 lunch. Afterwards we had ice cream.   
 Sometimes I go downstairs because I   
 can smell the cooking. My mum does not
 let me help her because she can do it 
 faster by herself. Some Sunday        
 afternoons my dad takes me swimming.  
 I can swim underwater.My dad sometimes
 goes on a motor bike run and we go    
 with him. There is a parade. Some     
 bikes are very old and some quite new.</content>
