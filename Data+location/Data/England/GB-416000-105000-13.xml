		<content>   To make{Poulner}a better place, Mr. 
 Russell says he would particularly    
 like more recreation land.  Given     
 proper supervision, this school's     
 extensive playing fields might also be
 opened to the public. This might help 
 to combat{vandalism}and stop{illegal  
{entry} and give young people what they
 need.                                 
   Poulner School used to have no      
 vandalism whatsoever, but nowadays    
 they suffer vandalism approximately   
 every two weeks. Earlier this very    
 week the swimming pool was vandalised,
 also many windows get broken and even 
 the roofs are damaged.                
   "Poulner," says Mr.Russell, "cannot 
 expand much more. The land to the     
 north is being turned into lakes by   
 gravel extraction{no building}must    
{ever}be allowed to the east within{   
 the{New Forest."}                     </content>
