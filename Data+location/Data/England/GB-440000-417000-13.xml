		<title>13TWO WRAGBY PEOPLE</title>
		<content>  There is a blacksmith in{Wragby}     
 village, but nowadays he is not as    
 busy as in the past since most of the 
 village's residents are elderly and   
 have no need of his services.         
   The stables at Nostell Priory used  
 to provide a big demand for his skills
 , but then they acquired their own    
 blacksmiths to work on site. This     
 meant the Wragby smith lost his major 
 customer.                             
   Not far from the black smith's house
 is {Longley Labrador Kennels,}set in  
 an open area near {Longley Woods }.The
 kennels no longer operate as a full   
 time working business because of a    
 fall in demand and because of health  
 problems                              
   The owner merely keeps the dogs for 
 a hobby. 'Longley' is a prefix which  
 was given by the kennel club.
