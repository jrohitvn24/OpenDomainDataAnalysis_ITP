		<content> Clocktower Square is dominated by the 
 old clocktower which now stands in the
 middle of a park, the only relic of   
 Caledonian Cattle Market. It is       
 dwarfed by the surrounding modern     
 flats and this contrast continues     
 throughout the area. Early Victorian  
 goods depot and terraced houses stand 
 side by side with flats and houses    
 built within the past five years.     
 The area is still devloping - much    
 open space has been made and there are
 sites for new industry ready for      
 rental.                               
 The people provide an equal contrast. 
 Old indigenous population who have    
 lived here for many generations share 
 their space with newer residents from 
 many different countries.             
 The area is well served with transport
 and is intersected by underground and 
 overground railways.                  </content>
