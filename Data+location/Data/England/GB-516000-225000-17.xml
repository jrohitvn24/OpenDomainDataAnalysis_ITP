		<content> "During the 1950's the Parks was      
 meadow-land with cows and horses.They 
 grazed on the lush grass and butter-  
 cups, daisies and mushrooms.They used 
 to stand under our oak tree with their
 heads over the back fence.Once they   
 broke through one of the fences and   
 trampled all over the gardens in      
 Priory Way!                           
 "Many elm trees died in the area a few
 years ago and a number of old oaks    
 have been chopped down too.           
 "In ancient times, the Park was a     
 Roman market and old coins are often  
 found even today.The oak tree is over 
 400 years old.                        
 "35 years ago,Charlton was quite      
 different with a very old public house
 and old cottages opposite.These have  
 been pulled down to make a car-park.  
 The lane to Charlton was just a cart  
 track until about 15 years ago".      </content>
