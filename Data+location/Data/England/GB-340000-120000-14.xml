		<title>14Child's Weekend.Kingsbury.</title>
		<content>{Athene.}On Saturday I cycled to Kings 
 bury church fete with mum.I was in a  
 folk dance team there.I wore a checked
 skirt and a white shirt with a red    
 ribbon.Mrs Marks took some photos of  
 the girls who danced.{ }              
{Martin.}At the weekend we were        
 haymaking at Westport. My brother     
 mowed 5 fields.Then he turned them    
 twice.Meanwhile my father was baling  
 the 15 acre field,which had been cut  
 and turned 2 days before.I helped to  
 put bales by hand on to the trailer.  
{Chris.}On Sunday I went to Wells      
 Cathedral.It was lovely inside.A guide
 showed us around.On the pillars were  
 carvings telling a story about a      
 farmer and an apple tree.Later I      
 bought a candle for 10p,lighted it and
 made a wish.At first I forgot to      
 wish,but mum reminded me.
