		<title>12  I INTERVIEWED GRANDMA</title>
		<content>   My Grandma remembered that she liked
 school and that there was a smell of  
 chalk dust.                           
   They used nylon stockings which     
 lasted a long time.  They had         
 parachute silk underwear in the war.  
   She said that cars often broke down.
 They had running boards which you had 
 to step on to get in the car.  They   
 also had little flaps in the roof.    
 She had an Armstrong.                 
   In the Drapers they had a high desk 
 at the back and you put your money in 
 a basket on a wire and the person at  
 the other end would put your change in
 the basket and send it back to you.   
 They did not have any super-markets.  
 They used to have lots more little    
 shops and some dairies.               
   They had radios but no television.  
 They played hop-scotch, ball games and
 did lots of handstands.               </content>
