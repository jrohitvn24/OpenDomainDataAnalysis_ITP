		<content>  {"'Big cat' may have claimed fresh   
{victim"}is the headline describing the
 latest sighting of the mysterious     
 animal which over the past two and a  
 half years has become the Island's    
 mystery creature. In this latest      
 incident, Mr. R. Kingswell of         
 Rowborough Farm found the carcase of  
 the second of two lambs discovered in 
 circumstances quite unlike any such   
 previous lamb death. "The lamb was too
 big for a dog, fox or badger to kill, 
 and it was eaten. It must have been   
 something pretty big to kill it". He  
 took it to the proprietor of the      
 Island's zoo at Sandown who admitted  
 that it could have been a large       
 panther-like animal. An animal fitting
 this description was also spotted by a
 worker at Cheverton Farm, who followed
 it in a Land-Rover and described it as
 "a large cat with sharp pointed ears".</content>
