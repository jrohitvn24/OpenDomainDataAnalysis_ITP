		<title>01Ashford Carbonell</title>
		<content> The area being looked at by Ashford   
 Carbonell School lies to the south of 
 the county of Shropshire.It is a      
 peaceful rural area with no major     
 industrial development.Ashford        
 Carbonell is an old village with the  
 church dating back to Norman times,   
 a village school of the 19th century, 
 and village hall of the early 20th    
 century. The area has changed over the
 centuries,but only slowly.Many of the 
 cider orchards and smaller fields     
 bounded by hedges have been replaced  
 by larger fields of wheat,barley and  
 grass.However most of the land is     
 still down to farming. The housing is 
 a mixture of very old,old,not so old  
 and new,which has meant that the      
 population of the area has increased  
 over the last 20 years.               
 Many people would consider this area  
 as a good place to live.              </content>
