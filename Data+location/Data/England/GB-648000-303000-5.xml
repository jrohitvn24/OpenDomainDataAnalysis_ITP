		<title>05BRADWELL PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>   The work of the council is carried  
 out by various committees. Here are   
 some examples.                        
   The{Housing and Planning Committee  
 deals with planning applications for  
 new buildings or extensions.          
   The{Community Facilities Development
{Committee}is responsible for the      
 upkeep of the playing fields,         
 footpaths and seats.                  
   The{Poor Marsh Trustees}administer  
 the poor marsh. In 1895 a piece of    
 land, about four acres in all, was    
 acquired by the parish council. This  
 land was let every year for grazing   
 and the money was used to buy coal for
 the poor of the parish every          
 Christmas.                            
   Nowadays, money is given instead of 
 coal. In 1984 six people were given   
 Â£10 at Christmas.
