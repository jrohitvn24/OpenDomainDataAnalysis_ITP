		<title>10INDUSTRY IN GRANTHAM</title>
		<content> Since 1945 Grantham has sited several 
 of its new areas of industry out of   
 its centre, eg the Alma Park complex  
 on hilly land not accessible to the   
 main road, the A1 or to the railway,  
 both of which are to the W of the     
 town. However the land selected for   
 the Alma Park Estate had already been 
 used in World Wars 1 &amp; 2 by the       
 military services &amp; some of the farm- 
 land was not profitable enough to     
 remain as countryside. Most of the new
 sites are occupied by comparatively   
 light industries &amp; 1 or 2 are strictly
 service industries headquarters and   
 stores. The East Midlands Electricity 
 Board complex being a good example.   
 Others like the Stanbrough Press,     
 Grosvenor Furniture,Kontak Engineering
 and Paktronic are new &amp; expanding     
 sites engaged in modern manufactures  
 and sales. It strains local services. </content>
