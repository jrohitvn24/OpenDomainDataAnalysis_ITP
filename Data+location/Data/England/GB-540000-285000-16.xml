		<title>16Chatteris - A Working Day</title>
		<content> My Dad gets up at 7.30, has his       
 breakfast and leaves for work at      
 around 8.15.  He works for Sheaffer   
 Pens and travels to various places in 
 a red Sierra car.  Sometimes he       
 goes as far as Newcastle.             
                                       
 He has worked for Sheaffers for ten   
 years and sells pens to big stores    
 like Boots and W.H.Smiths.  He usually
 gets home about 5.30 and then changes 
 his suit for something more           
 comfortable, before having his tea.   
 At about 7.00 he does his paper work  
 which may take two hours.             
                                       
 He then usually watches television    
 until about 11.45 when he goes to bed.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
