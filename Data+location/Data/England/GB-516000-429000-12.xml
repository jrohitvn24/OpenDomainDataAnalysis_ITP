 By far the larges industrial concern  
 close to the school is the BP Saltend 
 chemical works.  It employs a         
 significant proportion of Preston's   
 working population.                   
 The Saltend site was begun after the  
 First World War and by the 1930's it  
 was owned and run by the Distillers   
 Company limited.  The products        
 included spirit used in the           
 manufacture of alcoholic drinks and   
 acetic acid.                          
 During the 1960's BP bought the plant 
 and began a significant expansion     
 programme making BP Saltend the       
 largest acetic acid making plant in   
 Europe.                               
 The Saltend site was originally built 
 for Green and Co.                     </content>
