		<title>20Strensall - Social Concerns</title>
		<content> In common with most local villages,   
 Strensall has a number of agencies    
 concerned with{raising money.} Some   
 help national charities such as the   
 NSPCC and the Lifeboat Fund.  The     
{village hall}in Strensall is very old 
 and inadequate and a great many people
 have been trying to raise money for a 
 new one for several years.  There are 
 talks about trying to build a new hall
 on the school site to form a{community
{school.} All of the concern is to keep
 Strensall as a community and to       
 provide focal points for people to    
 meet.  The many new residents in      
 Strensall tend to look to York for    
 their shopping and entertainment.  The
{preservation of the local community is
 very important in many people's       
 opinion and occupies the thoughts and 
 efforts of villagers in other newly   
 built-up areas too.                   </content>
