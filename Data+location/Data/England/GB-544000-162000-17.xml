		<content>Green Street Green is on the outer edge
of the South East London suburbs       
bordering the Green Belt,made up of    
woodlands and farmland.                
Although it is now a suburban area it  
has retained some village character.   
It began in the last century as a small
Victorian setttlement outside the      
suburbs of the day.                    
The oldest part now forms a small,     
rather ragged,shopping centre in the   
High Street,where the old and new shops
are mixed with some industry and       
housing. A modern Supermarket has been 
made to fit in well with the village   
style.                                 
The residential section has been       
extended from the old centre in a      
piecemeal fashion in the pre-war,      
inter-war,and post-war phases.
