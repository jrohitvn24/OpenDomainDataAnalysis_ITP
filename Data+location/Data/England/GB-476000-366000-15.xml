		<title>15Scarthingmoor Mill</title>
		<content>   This mill has been in the same      
 family for generations and the present
 owner has run the farm for 39 years to
 date.It takes its name from an old    
{water mill}which was originally used  
 to supply power for grinding grain.   
 The{water source}was a stream behind  
 the mill, partially dammed to divert  
 the stream in the right direction.    
 Although the dam is still there the   
 wheel is no longer in use and the mill
 machinery is powered by{electricity.  
   The present mill has three storeys  
 with a central winch, for hoisting the
 bags of grain. The walls get          
 progressively thinner with height. The
 mill now grinds wheat, barley and rye.
   There is a collection of old mill   
 stones once used in the mill and      
 replaced when they became too worn to 
 be fully effective.
