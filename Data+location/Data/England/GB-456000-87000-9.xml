		<content>  Despite grant aid for farmers to     
 pull up{hedgerows}we found only one   
 example of this in our area. As well  
 as the hedges there is some copse and 
 other woodland so there are plenty of 
 fairly safe habitats for rodents and  
 other{mammals.}We saw rabbits on the  
 North side of Ashey Down and we found 
 evidence of mice and voles on the     
 Downs and in the woodland areas.      
  We saw a{Kestrel}on the Downs and    
 were told of a{Barn Owl}nesting at    
 Whitefield Farm.                      
  The cowman at West Ashey also told us
 that he had seen{foxes}on his farm but
 he thought they came from some        
 distance away.                        
  This also seemed to be a good year   
 for{pheasants}despite the fact that   
 the old gamekeeper's cottage is empty 
 so noone is looking after them any    
 more.                                 </content>
