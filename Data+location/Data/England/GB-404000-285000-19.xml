		<title>19RAG MARKET</title>
		<content>   Named after the parish church of    
St.Martin in the Bull Ring,built by the
De Bermingham family in the 13th       
century,Birmingham's famous Rag Market 
is held in this building.The "Rag      
Alley"is famous for its bargains.For   
example:Christian Dior fancy stockings 
can be bought for 30p a pair,and one   
can buy eight pairs of tights for #1.  
   Traders from as far away as         
Nottingham,Derby and Manchester occupy 
stalls in the "Rag Tag" each market    
day.They can do this because of the    
city's good position in the heart of   
the motorway network.There are over 560
stalls,displaying new and secondhand   
goods of all descriptions.             
   Until recently,the Rag market shared
the building with the secondary        
Horticultural Wholesale Traders and the
Farmers and Growers who now occupy a   
new Wholesale Markets Precinct.        </content>
