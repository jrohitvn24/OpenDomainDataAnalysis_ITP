		<content>   Bishampton is a linear village set  
 in gently rolling hills. Originally a 
 spring line settlement, it has        
 undergone considerable development    
 recently. Of the 202 houses in the    
 village, the vast majority (151) have 
 been built in the last 50 years.      
 twenty-two half-timbered "black and   
 white" cottages still remain from the 
 Tudor period and there are twelve     
 "farmworkers" cottages built between  
 the 18th century and the turn of this 
 century. There are 102 detached houses
 and 100 semi-detached, 147 dwellings  
 have a garage, which is not surprising
 as about 200 cars are owned in the    
 village, most families having at least
 one car and many two.Most children own
 a bicycle and several people have     
 motor-bikes.
