		<title>14DRY STONE WALLING, WYKE AREA</title>
		<content>   In the area, the fences are a       
 mixture of dry stone walls, hedges and
 fences.  Jim Marsh of Elland, was a   
 farmer who learned the art of dry     
 stone walling as part of his daily    
 work.  He is now retired, but uses his
 skill repairing walls for local       
 farmers.                              
   Knowing how and where to split the  
 gritstone and sandstone is an art in  
 itself.  The wall has a base of       
 'footings', and is then built up in   
 two faces with the fragments broken   
 off from the larger rocks used as     
 infil.  Every couple of feet 'through'
 stones are inserted for stability and 
 the wall completed with a row of      
 capstones.                            
   Jim's secret for a strong, hardy    
 wall is a wide base tapering to a     
 narrow top.
