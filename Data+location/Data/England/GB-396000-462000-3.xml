		<title>03THE VILLAGE OF LINTON</title>
		<content>{Linton}is a typical Anglian name which
 means{'Flax Farm'}and for many        
 centuries{Flax}was produced here. The 
 houses are ranged round a{Square      
{Village Green}with{Captains Beck      
 running along the West side of it.{The
{Road Bridge}was built in{1892         
 replacing 2 Fords.{The Pack Horse     
{Bridge}was called{'Redmayne'}bridge   
 because it was said to be built by    
{Mrs. Redmayne}in the{17th century.}At 
 the end of the{Green}is the{'Clapper  
{Bridge'}built with huge Flag Stones   
 but now the Flags are covered with    
 tar. There is a{Ford}on the left hand 
 side of the{Pack Horse Bridge.}The    
 first written records of{Linton}were  
 in The{Domesday Book of 1087.}Today   
{Linton}is little changed with most of 
 the dwellings being adaptations of the
 original ones.
