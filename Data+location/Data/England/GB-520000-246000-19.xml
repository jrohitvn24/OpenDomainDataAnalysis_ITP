		<title>19HOUSING IN SUTTON</title>
		<content> A great range of styles and period of 
 house is to be found in Sutton.There  
 are 3 types of council houses_those at
 the Crossroads having been built      
 following the first world war and     
 those at Clay End and the eastern end 
 of the High Street after the second   
 world war.The majority are 3-bedroomed
 semi-detached homes.There are some    
 bungalows for the elderly.The more    
 modern houses are generally of the    
 executive type many of which overlook 
 the golf course.There are several     
 small Victorian terraces built for    
 farm workers around 1870.On these can 
 be seen the Burgoyne family crest.    
 There are a number of houses of       
 historical interest in the village_   
 The Old Rectory,Church Farm which is  
 part Tudor and part Stuart,Village    
 Farm built in 1630 and several others.
