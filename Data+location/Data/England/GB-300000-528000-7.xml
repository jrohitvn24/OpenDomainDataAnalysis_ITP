		<title>07ST. MICHAEL'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> St. Michaels Church was built in the  
 7th century in Saxon times. In the    
 baptistry of the church, there are 4  
 fragments of carved stones standing on
 a large Norman block. These fragments 
 are the remains of the Saxon crosses, 
 whichhave remained from those early   
 days. They were a gathering place for 
 the Saxons, andthe church was probably
 wooden.                               
 After the conquest,the Normans smashed
 down the crosses and replaced them    
 with a stone church, with proper      
 The Noman church, a very strong       
 building like a fortress, was built in
                                       
 1100 AD.                              
 All of the ancestors of the local     
 Curwen family are buried here, some in
 stone tombs with carved figures on    
 top.                                  
 The church can accommodate 1000 people</content>
