		<content> Guitar class. There is a beginners    
 group and a more advanced group. The  
 notes we play are G, D, and A. Mr.    
 Huddleston teaches us.                
 On Tuesday after school a group of    
 children, from class four only, went  
 to Short Tennis in the school         
 hall. The coaches were Mrs.Holloway   
 and Mrs. Holmes. All the children who 
 took part enjoyed it. James Holloway  
 won the area singles final and Robert 
 Holmes and James Holloway won the     
 doubles.                              
 Our Tennis club has got quite a lot of
 rules. I can only remember one of them
  - if there is an adult waiting for   
 you after 6.00pm and if you are with a
 child then you have to let the adult  
 go on the court. There is a practise  
 wall as well as four courts. They are 
 building a new pavilion to share with 
 the bowling club.                     </content>
