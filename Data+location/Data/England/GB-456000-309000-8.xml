		<title>08THE RAILWAY IN BIRSTALL</title>
		<content> The{Great Central Railway}was opened  
 on 1st Jan. 1847 and ran from         
 Manchester to London. The section of  
 line through Birstall was closed in   
 May 1969. Since then, the track,      
 sleepers, signals etc. have been      
 removed. The line has become a haven  
 for wildlife. Foxes have been seen in 
 the early morning along this track.   
 All the bridges are intact and the    
 route is used for walking, exercising 
 dogs, unofficial motorcycling and as a
 playground.                           
    The line near{Rothley Brook}is     
 working and the section of line       
 between Rothley and Birstall is hoping
 to reopen in 1987. The land is being  
 reclaimed by the{Main Line Steam      
{Trust,}with the help of Charnwood     
 Borough Council and the Birstall      
 Action Team. Preserved steam trains   
 will soon travel to{Birstall Station. </content>
