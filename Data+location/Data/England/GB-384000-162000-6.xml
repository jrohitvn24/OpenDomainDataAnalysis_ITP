		<content> Public transport in this area is      
 generally very sparse and is          
 non-existant in the evening and on    
 Sunday. A bus service runs between    
 Chippenham, Melksham and Trowbridge   
 passing through the villages every 2  
 hours Monday-Saturday, this service   
 ends at 5.30pm. On Wedsnesday and     
 Saturday there is a morning service to
 Bath, giving three hours shopping     
 before returning at lunch time. This  
 shopping bus is well used as the fare 
 is reasonable. The regular service    
 taking passengers to the local towns  
 is little used except early morning   
 and evening when people travel to and 
 from work and school. A high          
 percentage of households have their   
 own cars and cycles. The nearest      
 mainline railway station is at        
 Chippenham eight miles away.
