		<content> This is a village of contrasts in     
 housing.  The farmhouses are hugh and 
 there is also a council housing estate
 of some 20 red brick tile-roofed      
 houses.  Of these, ten are            
 semi-detached and eight are terraced  
 in groups of four, built in red brick 
 with tiled roofs.  Some tenants have  
 bought their council homes in recent  
 years.  There is one bungalow of a    
 simple design in red brick with a     
 slate roof.  Medlar Hall Farm has a   
 very large house, high with large     
 windows, about 150 years old, built of
 handmade bricks with a slate roof and 
 high brick chimneys.  The other       
 fram houses are large about 100 - 150 
 years old.  Most are owner occupied.
