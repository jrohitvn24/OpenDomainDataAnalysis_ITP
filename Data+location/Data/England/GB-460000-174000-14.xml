		<content>  {St. Lawrence's Church,}Tidmarsh,    
 dates from the 11th. century. It was  
 re-opened in 1897 following extensive 
 restoration. The oldest grave is dated
 1777. There is a 150 year old tree in 
 the graveyard.                        
  Until 1984 Tidmarsh (with Sulham) had
 it's own parish priest but it is now  
 grouped with the parish of Pangbourne.
{  St. Stephen's Church}in Upper       
 Basildon was built in 1964. The       
 architect of St. Stephens was Peter   
 Noel Perkins. The ground plan is      
 designed in the shape of a fish, an   
 unconventional and striking design.   
 Perkins wished the church to be the   
 visual focus of the village whilst    
 retaining a family atmosphere. The    
 church cost Â£12,600 to build. Inside  
 hang two large pictures by Stephen    
 Robertson-Roger a local artist.They   
 depict the trial of St. Stephen.      </content>
