		<content> This is a small operation...They buy  
 in timber"in the round"i.e. as        
 trees, from Stansted Estate (now very 
 little due to conservation policies)  
 or other timber mechants in Hampshire 
 or Sussex __ thereby keeping purchase 
 as local as posible.The trees are then
 converted into fencing, garden        
 products, fencing panels, firewood    
 etc.The waste product_sawdust_is used 
 in kennels and stables on local       
 farms.Their products are sold as far  
 afield as London. Woods mainly dealt  
 with are Oak (hardwood).Conifers such 
 as Douglas fir,larch and Scots Pine   
 (Softwood).
