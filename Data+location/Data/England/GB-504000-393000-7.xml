		<content> Of the 168 adults living within this  
 block 98 are in full-time employment  
 though only 1/3 of that number work   
 within the area.Farming is still the  
 largest employer with 36 people,the   
 local duck industry coming 2nd. Other-
 wise there is a remarkably wide range 
 of activities:-council workers,garage 
 mechanics,lorry drivers,factory work- 
 ers,the army,a merchant seaman,builder
 gardener,electrician,engineer &amp; sales 
 rep.with among the females:-shop and  
 office workers,a teacher,hairdresser &amp;
 nursing auxilliary. There is a certain
 amount of casual seasonal work such as
 potato picking,but lack of public tra-
 nsport and the costs of car ownership 
 make travel to part time or low paid  
 work uneconomic even when available.  
 Despite these problems only about 12  
 people are unemployed and at least 2  
 of these have chosen early retirement.</content>
