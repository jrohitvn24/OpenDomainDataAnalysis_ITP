		<content> For{Gobble_Obble}you need 3 or more   
 people. You have to have some lines   
 marked out on a playground or field.  
 You have to pick a place for your den 
 near to the marked lines. One person  
 is chosen to be "It". When everyone is
 in the den at the start of the        
 game, somebody says "All pacmen on    
 alert!" Then everyone has to get out  
 of the den and run along the lines and
 back to their den. They must go to the
 end but dodge the person who is "It". 
 If they catch you and say             
 "Gobble_Obble" you are the next "It". 
 If somebody is in trouble because the 
 "It" has almost got them,they shout   
 "Pacmates!", and the other people who 
 are playing have to try and help by   
 distracting the "It".                 
                                       
{This game is based on a very popular} 
{video game known as Pacman.}          </content>
