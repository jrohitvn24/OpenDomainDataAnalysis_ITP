		<title>04The Village Policeman.</title>
		<content> Law and order is maintained in Scotter
 and{12}other villages by{1}police     
 constable who lives in a police house 
 in {Scotter.}Joined to this house is a
 small office, where he does his       
 paperwork,and a garage for his{panda  
{car}, which he needs to patrol such a 
 large area.The nearest police station 
 is in{Gainsborough}which provides all 
 the specialized backup services he    
 might need. Emergency 999 calls are   
 dealt with at{Gainsborough}or{        
{Scunthorpe}.He works from{9am to 5pm} 
 but is really never off duty. If he is
 away he is not replaced but extra cars
 from Gainsborough patrol his beat.    
   {Crime prevention}rather than the   
 solving of crime is his major         
 responsibility.Therefore he visits    
 schools,clubs,meetings and any        
 functions in the area to get to know  
 people.                               </content>
