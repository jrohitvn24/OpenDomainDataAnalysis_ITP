		<content>   Jill's favourite game.              
                                       
 One of the favourite games that I play
 at home is Sevensy's.This is a game   
 played with a ball.You start by       
 throwing the ball up onto the wall and
 catching it, then you throw it up and 
 let it bounce.It is called Sevensy's  
 because you start on 7 and gradually  
 work down to 1.These are the actions: 
{SEVEN}:Throw your ball on the wall and
 catch it.{SIX}:Throw your ball onto   
 the wall let it bounce and catch it,{ 
{FIVE}:bounce the ball five times.{    
{FOUR:}throw the ball under your leg   
 and catch.{THREE}:bounce the ball onto
 the floor let it bounce on the wall   
 and catch it.{TWO}:throw the ball up  
 in the air, bounce it and catch then  
 repeat.{ONE}:throw the ball in the air
 and catch it.                         
                                       </content>
