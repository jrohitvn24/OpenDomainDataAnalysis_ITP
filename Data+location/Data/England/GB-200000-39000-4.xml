		<title>04Gorran Haven - Fishing</title>
		<content> In the 19th Century Gorran Haven was a
 busy and prosperous fishing community 
 with about 30 boats,60 fishermen and a
 flourishing boatbuilding industry.    
 Today there are only part-time        
 fishermen;6 to 10 boats go line       
 fishing for mackerel,pollack,mullet   
 and bass.About 6 boats go out working 
 20 to 30 crab and lobster pots.All the
 catch is sold at Mevagissey - 5 miles 
 away.In the summer several boats work 
 taking visitors out on angling trips. 
 The reason for the decline in fishing 
 is the modernisation of the industry -
 one large boat with modern equipment  
 can catch more fish in one day than   
 the old boats caught in a week.Hence, 
 the seas around this coast have been  
 overfished and the small fisherman can
 no longer make a living.
