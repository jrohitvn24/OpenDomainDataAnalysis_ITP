		<title>11FISHING IN QUEENBOROUGH</title>
		<content>    My dad has got a fishing boat      
 called Rebecca Rochester. We sometimes
 go to fish down by the{Ferry Bridge.  
 One day I caught a flatfish and 11    
 eels altogether. Sometimes I sleep on 
 the boat. The bed is like a long seat 
 and we wrap up in blankets. We might  
 cook the fish that we catch. I like   
 fried eels but my dad takes sandwiches
 as well. The longest I've ever stayed 
 out there is two nights.              
    My dad goes out fishing about twice
 a week and nearly every weekend. He   
 often takes other people out fishing  
 because the boat is licenced to carry 
 10 people. Sometimes they just stay   
 quite near to{Queenborough}but        
 sometimes they go out by the forts in 
 the{Thames Estuary.
