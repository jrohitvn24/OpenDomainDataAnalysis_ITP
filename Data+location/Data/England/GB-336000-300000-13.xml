		<title>13The Mining Industry.</title>
		<content> Since Roman times there have been     
 mines in the area of Snailbeach and   
 Stiperstones.Recent mining began from 
 around 1760,but the most intensive    
 period of working was in the middle   
 of the 19th.Century.By 1910 almost all
 mining had finished but continued on a
 small scale until the 1950's.So far   
 28 mine shafts have been found and    
 filled.There were quanties of zinc and
 barytes found in the mines and there  
 is still lead.There are horizontal    
 tunnels called adits for the men to   
 enter the mines and the shafts were   
 used for lowering the buckets down to 
 collect the minerals.The mines are    
 visited a lot by tourists.In a survey 
 of local opinion we found that a few  
 people would like the mining industry 
 revived, but a lot of people said no. 
 The majority of the local people are  
 in favour of a small mining museum.   </content>
