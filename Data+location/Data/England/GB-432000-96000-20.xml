		<title>20PROBLEMS IN PILLEY/BOLDRE</title>
		<content> There are few jobs actually available 
 within the area and the amenities of  
 modern living are few.Both these      
 problems could be negated by the      
 provision of a good bus service,as now
 the use of a car is almost essential. 
 Thus teenagers feel they are not      
 catered for and are restricted in     
 their choice of recreation .Housing,as
 in similar villages tends to be       
 expensive.Cheap"starter Homes"are     
 difficult to obtain.Planners put high 
 priority on preserving the essential  
 nature of the area.For instance a     
 proposed oil pipeline tobe laid across
 the area is causing considerable      
 discussion and some opposition.Most   
 inhabitants,from Elanor aged 10 to the
 lady in her 80's and all the others   
 who helped Boldre W.I.to compile this 
 report,take pleasure in the mainly    
 rural nature of Boldre                </content>
