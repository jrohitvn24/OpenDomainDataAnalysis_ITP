		<content> There are eight small brick{bridges   
 across the stream at{Marshside,}they  
 give access to the fields of the      
 Chislet Marshes. They are of different
 shapes and sizes, one has a pointed   
 arch and another is elliptical,the    
 rest are round. Two of the eight      
 bridges have stone arches and parapet 
 tops but the rest are wholly of brick.
 One of the stone bridges is dated{1793
 on the keystone. This date is thought 
 to be that of the construction of     
 these bridges, although they must be  
 the latest in a long line of bridges  
 that have served the community. The   
 waterway crossed by the bridges is the
{North Stream.}It forms the western    
 boundary of the marsh and is most     
 important for the drainage of the high
 ground. The bridges that cross it are 
 essential to both public and farmers.
