 Mr Hirst has been running his farm for
 33 years. He was farming before at    
 Scholes, Holmfirth. He was brought up 
 on a farm. He says that the area has  
 changed a lot because of better farm  
 machinery and more modern farming     
 methods. His farm consists of 175     
 acres, 2 of these are arable, and 173 
 are grass land. 80 acres of this he   
 mows for hay and silage; 93 acres are 
 used for grazing pastures. His land is
 scattered {NOT}in one block. He has 80
 Fresians, used for milking and some   
 charolais for beef. He has sixteen    
 breeding cows and 32 calves. He also  
 has 50 breeding ewes, from which he   
 has raised 92 lambs this year. He buys
 and sells at Penistone and            
 Huddersfield markets. Penistone market</content>
