 rememberance of those who died in the 
 First World War,funded by individual  
 contributions,and even donations of   
 the cost of  single bricks.The        
 extension to that first building was  
 completed in 1981 in order to offer a 
 wider range of facilities, and        
 hopefully enhance its attraction to   
 the community.Membership is open to
