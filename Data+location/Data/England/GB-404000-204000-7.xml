		<content>{  A day in the life of Louise Edwards.
                                       
 Today is the 20th of July in the      
 summer of 1985. I have chosen this    
 date to be a fair representation of a 
 day in my life. My  name is Louise    
 Edwards, I am 15 years old .I live    
 with my mother, father, sister Lisa,  
 who is 14 and my brother Lance, who is
 12. We live in the village of Barnsley
 near Cirencester.  I have chosen a non
 - school day.                         
   I get up at about 9:oo, have        
 breakfast and watch television. I go  
 to work in the Village Pub at 11:30. I
 normally go to Cirencester in the     
 afternoon to meet my friends. I stay  
 with a friend until 6:00 and then we  
 go roller skating at the Sport Centre.
 My mother or father collect me and    
 maybe Lisa and Lance at 10:30. We get 
 home at 10:45,and go straight to bed. </content>
