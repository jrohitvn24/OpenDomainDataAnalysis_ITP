		<content> I'm Karl. My Dad works for a local    
{taxi service}which operates 24 hours a
 day. There are 4 drivers and 4 cars.  
 To order a taxi, you phone the        
 service. They call the driver who will
 collect you.  My Dad sometimes drives 
 to Gatwick airport. We go out in our  
 own car most of the time, but         
 sometimes we use the taxi. My Dad has 
 to go as far as Oxford with some of   
 his fares.                            
 I'm Scott. My Dad works for a local   
{parcels service}providing next-day    
 delivery through a{hub system.}There  
 are 110 depots in this country. My Dad
 picks up parcels and brings them to   
 his unit garage in West Moors. Night  
 trunking vehicles take them to the{hub
 in Kidderminster, where they are      
 redistributed to the depots and       
 delivered to the customers in the     
 morning by the local drivers.         </content>
