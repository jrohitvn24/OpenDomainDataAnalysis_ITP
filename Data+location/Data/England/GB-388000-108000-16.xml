		<title>16Blandford Camp,Near Pimperne</title>
		<content> Near Pimperne is Blandford Camp,      
 one of two major Signals Camps in the 
 country. In l9l4 it was a naval camp  
 and became an army camp in l939. Now  
 there are about 2,000 people who live 
 and work on the Camp. There are shops,
 a Church, a bank, a Post Office and a 
 First School called Downlands.        
 Soldiers are highly trained to provide
 communications for the British Army   
 worldwide.  They have facilities for  
 sports, pitches, a gymnasium, and an  
 assault course.  They have a cinema,  
 social clubs called messes, dances,   
 lectures.  The Corps band plays       
 concerts at home and abroad and       
 parades through Blandford with        
 soldiers with fixed bayonets because  
 they have the freedom of Blandford.   
 The Corps of Signals badge has        
 Mercury, the Royal Crown and the words
 Certa Cito meaning swift and sure.    </content>
