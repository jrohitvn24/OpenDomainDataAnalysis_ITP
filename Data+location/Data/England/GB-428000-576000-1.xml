		<title>01NEW HARTLEY</title>
		<content>    {New Hartley} is on the North East 
 coast of England. It is 10 miles from{
{Newcastle Upon Tyne} and 5 miles from 
 the market town and port of{Blyth.    
     The name{New Hartley}came from{   
{Hartley} which is now part of{Seaton  
{Sluice.}In Hartley there was a coal   
 mine. When this mine closed in{1840}  
 the whole community moved inland to a 
 new mine and village which became{New 
{Hartley.                              
{   }At first there were only 3 rows of
 houses: Long Row, Double Row and Cross
 Row. The village as it is in l985 only
 developed after the{Pit Disaster}of{  
{l862.}Only part of Double Row still   
 stands to show what the earliest      
 houses were like. The rest of the     
 village has been completely           
 redeveloped and has been built since  
 1914.
