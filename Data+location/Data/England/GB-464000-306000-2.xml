		<content> Mr Kirk has a mixed-farm - he keeps   
 dairy cattle and grows crops. Monday  
 started at 5.30 am when he got up. At 
 5.55 it was time to bring the cows    
 into the milking shed to start milking
 at 6.00. He had his breakfast at 8.00.
 At 8.30 he had to fetch 14 heifers    
 from the field and put 22 young calves
 outside. At 9.30 the{Milk Tanker}     
 arrived to collect the morning's milk.
 He had plenty of paper-work to do -   
 VAT and general book-keeping. He had a
 break at 10.30 after which it was time
 to clean out the calf-pen. At 12.00   
 the{AI (Artificial Insemination)}man  
 arrived. At 12.30 pm it was time for  
 dinner. At 1.30 some more calves had  
 to be moved outside. Spring cleaning  
 had to be done at 2.30. At 3.30 it was
 tea-break, and at 3.45 milking-time.  
 Tea-time was 5.30, and at 6.30 there  
 was time for odd-jobs.                </content>
