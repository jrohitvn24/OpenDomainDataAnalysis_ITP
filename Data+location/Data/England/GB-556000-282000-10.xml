		<content> When{Mr.Jakes}was asked for his       
 personal view, this was his answer.   
 'It is a quieter, more intimate type  
 of life. You know virtualy everyone in
 the Village and they know you. You can
 speak to everyone you meet.           
  If you want{Entertainment}such as    
 going to the Cinema or Restaurant then
 you have to travel, to Ely or even    
 Cambridge.                            
 I work in Cambridge (Cambridge        
 Library) and only two others in the   
 Village commute that far. The majority
 tend to work in or near the Village   
 such as Littleport, Ely or Soham'.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
