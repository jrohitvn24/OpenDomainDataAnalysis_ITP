		<title>16Problems of Shopping</title>
		<content> Shopping in the village of Littleton  
 is virtually non-existent. There is a 
 small Post Office which also sells    
 milk but no other provisions. Most of 
 the villagers do their regular        
 shopping in Thornbury which is about  
 four miles away.                      
 In Aust the Post Office also sells a  
 variety of grocery items. However,    
 most of the people we spoke to said   
 they did their shopping in            
 Thornbury,Bristol or at the Carrefour 
 Hypermarket at Cribbs Causeway.
