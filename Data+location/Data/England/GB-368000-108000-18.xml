		<content> This area provides good land for dairy
 farms,all of medium size,100_200 acres
 some with up to 50 acres arable.      
 Cattle are mainly Friesians;there are 
 also 3 Channel Island herds.Friesians 
 prouduce more milk than Channel       
 Islands but quality is lower.The Milk 
 Marketing board pays according to     
 quality.Prices vary at different times
 of the year.                          
 Farmers milk twice a day in milking   
 parlours,where milk travels along     
 pipelines from cows to bulk tanks.    
 It is stored at low temperatures until
 taken by tanker daily for processing  
 at the dairy.In summer the cattle are 
 strip fed on grass.Silage and hay are 
 made for winter feed.Silage is grass  
 which is mown,wilted for a day,chopped
 finely by forage harvester and stored 
 in a clamp in the farmyard.Grass is   
 also dried and baled as hay.          </content>
