		<title>08THE DAY OF A SENIOR CHILD.</title>
		<content>    I am 16 years old. I attend Ryton  
 Comprehensive School. At 9.00 we have 
 registration. First lesson is history.
 We have an essay to write - Improving 
 Landlords and the Enclosure Movement. 
 After Prefect duty at break I go to   
 R.E. and learn about the Sermon on the
 Mount and nuclear disarmament. I think
 everyone should get rid of nuclear    
 weapons.                              
    I go home for dinner.Some people   
 stay and have packed lunches as school
 meals are not popular. Afternoon      
 lessons begin with English.We are     
 reading a poem called "Death on a Live
 Wire",which is very morbid.On Fridays 
 instead of cooking we go to the       
 nursery to help. Last lesson is maths,
 which finishes at 3.35.               
    I am taking 7 'O' levels and a     
 C.S.E. in maths.                      
                                       </content>
