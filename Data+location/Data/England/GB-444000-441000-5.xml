		<content> The{landscape}around Tadcaster is     
 typical of a small country town.In the
 middle of Tadcaster there are{housing}
 estates and breweries, and anybody    
 would think that they were in the     
 mniddle of a large town, but as soon  
 as you get away from that it is open  
 countryside. Close by is the{by-pass} 
 which is very noisy but takes the     
 traffic away from the heart of the    
 town. The town is surrounded by       
 fields, most of which are cultivated, 
 not many being used for grazing. The  
 River Wharfe cuts the town in two and 
 provides good{fishing.}There are a    
 number of very nice walks in and      
 around Tadcaster.
