		<content>   Chinnor has two Primary schools but 
 no Secondary school.                  
   St Andrews C.E.School is the direct 
 descendant of Chinnor C.E. School     
 which had premises on the corner of   
 Station Road until the population     
 influx made this inadequate. New      
 buildings were erected further along  
 Station Road. By 1973, this school had
 over 800 pupils, using the old        
 buildings as well as the new. During  
 1974, a new school was erected in Mill
 Lane, near the large newly-built      
 housing estate. This school opened its
 doors under the name of Mill Lane     
 School in September 1974 with an      
 initial roll of approximately 480     
 children.                             
   At 11 years, children go on to      
 either Icknield, Watlington, or Lord  
 Williams's at Thame. Free transport is
 provided to both.                     </content>
