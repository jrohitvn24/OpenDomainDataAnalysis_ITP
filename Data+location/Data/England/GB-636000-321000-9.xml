		<title>09INDUSTRY IN CATFIELD</title>
		<content> Catfield is a working village. It is  
 the home of both established rural    
 companies and new businesses. Neave's 
 coach firm is based in the centre of  
 the village. The firm has recently    
 taken over council bus routes as the  
 rural services decline. Mixers        
 manufacture mobile buildings while    
 Horizon Craft next door build holiday 
 cruisers. Seamans the corn merchants  
 have a depot next to the mushroom     
 farm. Units on the new industrial     
 estate are operated by Stalham Joinery
 and a packing tray company. Another   
 site is owned by Sea and Land Pipes.  
 Threeways garage is only a service    
 garage now, but batteries, exhausts   
 and tyres can be bought at one of the 
 estate units. Seasonal work picking   
 sprouts and onions is also carried    
 out.
