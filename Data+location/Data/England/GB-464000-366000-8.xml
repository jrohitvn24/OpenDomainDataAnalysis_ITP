		<title>08Opening of Ollerton Complex</title>
		<content>      The Official Opening Day of the  
{Dukeries Complex}started appropriately
 with a large choir of Ollerton and    
 District Primary School children who  
 stole the show with their beautiful   
 singing of a Spring Anthem composed by
 Malcolm Bevan and David Allsop. This  
 was followed by a speech by Bill      
 Morris, Chairman of Notts.County      
 Council who praised Councillor Stella 
 Smedley for being the person primarily
 responsible for making the Dukeries   
 Complex a reality.                    
      There then followed,after slight 
 technical problems, a slide show of   
 the Dukeries Complex.                 
      Councillor Smedley made the      
 opening address and then unveiled a   
 plaque to officially open the Complex.
      A musical finale played by the   
 Dukeries Band ended the proceedings.
