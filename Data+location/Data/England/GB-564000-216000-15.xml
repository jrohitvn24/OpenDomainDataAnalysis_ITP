		<title>15A DAY IN ZOE'S LIFE.</title>
		<content> My name is{Zoe Harte.}I am 11 years   
 old and I live in Lamb Cottage in     
 Howe Street.I go to{Ford End School.  
 Each morning I am picked up by the    
 school bus.When we get into school we 
 have half an hour quiet reading.      
 The day I am describing is Monday.    
 First we have Savings which people    
 save in a Post Office account,also the
 children that have dinners give in    
 their money.After that we do some     
 maths or langauge or perhaps some     
 drawing or a painting. After assembly 
 we do much the same. We finish school 
 at 3:15 and I go home on the school   
 bus.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
