		<title>11SMALL COMPANY, THWAITES</title>
		<content> Mountain Method is a small company    
 that was started four years ago by two
 people.They make waterproof coats and 
 trousers to match, and a few tents and
 rucksacks. They cut about 30 to 50    
 garments at a time. There are roughly 
 four miles of cloth and 250 miles of  
 cotton in stock.                      
 The number of people employed has     
 gradually increased and now there are 
 30. The people who work for Mountain  
 Method work at home and they are      
 called outworkers. The workers get    
 paid so much a garment. All the       
 packing and sending off is done in our
 nearest town, Millom. They are not    
 going to open a factory because they  
 are afraid of going bankrupt.The      
 garments are sold in Ambleside or     
 Hawkshead and big towns like that. The
 owner says that sales go up on a rainy
 weekend!                              </content>
