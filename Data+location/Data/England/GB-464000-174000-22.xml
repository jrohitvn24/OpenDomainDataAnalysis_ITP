<title>22Charters Garage (Was Marshals)</title>
<content>

This is a 2011 update of the article that I wrote in 1986! 'Marshals Garage' has become 'Charters' and are now Peugeot agents. They start work at 7.30am and finish at 6pm. 500 cars are sold a year. The best selling car is a 207, the cheapest a 107 at £7k, the most expensive is an RCZ graphite at £31k, it is also the fastest. 15 people are employed and 70 cars are repaired a week. To enable comparison, if they were still Audi agents the most expensive car would have been an R8 at £92k.   &lt;br />
