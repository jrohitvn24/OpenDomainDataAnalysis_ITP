		<content> Families like wathcing television and 
 nearly everybody has one.  Video and  
 computer games are popular too, but we
 don't all have one.                   
                                       
 The majority of us have bikes and a   
 lot of boys have a BMX.  Most of us   
 have pets, mainly dogs, cats and fish.
                                       
 Although there are lots of cars on    
 the road, we either come to school by 
 bus or some of us walk.  We read      
 books, comics and magazines in our    
 spare time.  Some families like to    
 visit grandparents during weekends and
 families go out during holidays.
