		<title>11LANDUSE AND LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>   The landscape around the villages of
 Highnam and Tibberton is one of       
 undulating farmland.Betwwen the two   
 villages the land rises to a peak of  
 just over 65 metres along a ridge from
 Rodway Hill southwards through Highnam
 Woods.The ridge-top site has been used
 to advantage by the Pinetum.East of   
 the ridge the land is Grade 1         
 agricultural land producing cereals   
 and oil seed rape in 1985,in large    
 gently sloping fields.                
   The higher,more undulating,land     
 south of Tibberton is characterised by
 Grade 3 agricultural land with smaller
 fields and greater emphasis on        
 livestock. Close to Tibberton         
 orchards are significant,whilst the   
 Leadon valley North of Highnam with   
 its poor drainage is given over to    
 pasture.
