		<title>05Boughton House, Kettering.</title>
		<content>   Boughton House is situated 3 miles  
to the north-east of Kettering.        
   There is a fine armoury, notable    
works of art, tapestries and a         
collection of 17th. and 18th. century  
English and French furniture.          
   In Tudor times there was a monastic 
building on the site.                  
   Over a period of some 200 years this
was enlarged stage by stage around     
seven courtyards.                      
   In 1695 the French style addition   
left the building looking much as it   
does at present and there has been     
little real change during the last 200 
years.                                 
   The design is based on Versailles   
and set into the honey-coloured stone  
walls are over 400 windows which       
overlook the parkland, gardens or lake.
    Boughton House creates an          
impressive view from the main A43 road.</content>
