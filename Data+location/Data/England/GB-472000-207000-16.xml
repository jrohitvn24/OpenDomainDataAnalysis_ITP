 We woke at 7.30am and had breakfast.  
 At 8.35 Daddy went to work. He is a   
 doctor and is on call for emergencies.
 My Mum, 2 sisters and I went to do    
 some shopping. When we came back I    
 played with my friend Ian's electronic
 game called "Blockbuster". Then Ian   
 went home and we had lunch which was  
 fishfingers and chips and salad. After
 lunch my sisters went to our{village
