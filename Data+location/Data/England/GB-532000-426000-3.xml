		<content>  There are 6 night clubs,many of which
 are open all the year,although some   
 only open at weekends during the      
 winter months.These clubs are situated
 both in the town itself and on the    
 caravan and chalet parks.Few big name 
 entertainers visit the area and most  
 acts are locally based.               
  The main all purpose venue is the    
 Grand Pavillion.This occasionally     
 attempts to put on big name acts,     
 usually pop groups,although for much  
 of its time it serves as a community  
 centre.Many courses and clubs operate 
 during the day e.g. aerobics, weight  
 -lifting,badminton,yoga,self-defence. 
 Even tea dances are held.It is run by 
 the local authority and since it makes
 a loss it lives with the threat of    
 closure.However it does have its      
 successes,notably the regular holding 
 of antique,trade and craft fairs.     </content>
