		<title>07Bell Ringing.</title>
		<content> On Thursday,13 June, six of us went   
 with Mrs. Fleming up to church to look
 at the bell tower.There we met Mr.    
 Holloway who is the captain of the    
 bells.He took in to the part of the   
 tower where the bell ropes are and    
 showed us how to ring the bells.We had
 to stand on a platform.Mr. Holloway   
 opened the door to the spiral         
 staircase .At first it was dark but as
 we got used to the dim light it was'nt
 as dark.                              
  When we got into the clock tower Mr. 
 Holloway showed us part of the floor  
 that came up for the crane to put the 
 bells up.There are five bells.The     
 oldest one was dated 1520. The newest 
 bells in Woolley Church are the ones  
 that were made in Holland in 1983.
