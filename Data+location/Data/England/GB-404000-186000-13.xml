		<title>13Farming in Braydon</title>
		<content> There are 20 working farms in this    
 section almost all of which have dairy
 herds. 2 also have some beef cattle   
 and 2 have some sheep. One farm grows 
 cereal crops, barley this year 1985,  
 and at least 1 practises organic      
 farming. Most of the grassland is     
 intensivly managed to provide feed for
 the cattle all year round, in Spring a
 top dressing of nitrogen fertiliser is
 applied and the once the grass has    
 grown lush is is cut for silage, often
 2 crops are taken each year, then the 
 cattle are let out into the field for 
 the summer. The silage is stored in   
 large enclosed areas and covered with 
 polythene and is fed to the cattle in 
 the Winter when they are kept inside. 
 Hay is also harvested before the      
 cattle are turned out into the fields.
