		<title>01REF:04040096.AREA REVIEW.</title>
		<content> This is an area bounded by the large  
 conurbations of Bournemouth,Poole and 
 Wimborne.Kinson,on the outskirts of   
 Bournemouth,is densely populated with 
 good community facilities.Despite this
 there are still traces of the original
 village and its green to be seen.The  
 busy Kinson road is bounded by many   
 shops and carries heavy traffic all   
 the year to Bournemouth,Poole and the 
 West.                                 
    In direct contrast the area has    
 much open country laid to horticulture
 and mixed farming.A number of working 
 farms lie in the region.The river     
 Stour winds its way through pasture   
 land providing pleasant meanders,     
 fishing and boating.Hampreston Village
 is a contrast to the housing estates  
 of Kinson.Dudsbury Rings give evidence
 of earlier habitations.
