		<content> Red bricked houses,clean and new,     
 Washing flapping in the breeze,       
 Lawns well tended,flowers too,        
 Shaded by the great oak trees.        
                                       
 Children play between the houses      
 On their bikes and with their ball,   
 Starlings flutter,sensing danger,     
 Where a cats steps lightly fall.      
                                       
 Loudly fall the steps of someone,     
 Taking now a little walk,             
 With their dog,who trots behind them, 
 Friend who with his eyes would talk.  
                                       
 Down the hill are people shopping,    
 Shopkeepers nod and ladies wave.      
 A motor bike comes whizzing past them,
 Will they not our old peace save?
