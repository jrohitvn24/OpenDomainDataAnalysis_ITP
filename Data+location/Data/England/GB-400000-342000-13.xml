		<title>13Entertainment in Cheadle</title>
		<content>The earliest form of entertainment in  
Cheadle took place in a large tent in  
the Market Place,where people watched  
singers,mimics &amp; jugglers.Later the    
Drama &amp; Choral Societies combined to   
produce large scale Concerts to        
celebrate events of local or national  
importance.There were once several     
Cinemas in Cheadle which were later    
converted to Bingo Halls but they did  
not have lasting appeal.Nowadays       
people mainly watch T.V.or Videos      
in their own homes or travel to Hanley 
to the Cinema or the Theatre.The       
Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Society (Producer-  
-Mr.A.Gilbert)has been in existence    
since 1948 &amp; this year's production    
'Oklahoma' was well supported.There    
is a flourishing Dramatic Society.     
Productions take place at the Painsley 
School &amp; Cheadle High Lecture Theatre  
as cheadle does not have a Theatre.    </content>
