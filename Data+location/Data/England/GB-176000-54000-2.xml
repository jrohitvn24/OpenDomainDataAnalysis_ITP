		<content> Our block is basically{farmland}with  
 some villages, hamlets and a corner of
 Perranporth.It also has large areas of
 dune and the corner of a military     
 training area.Most of the farmland is 
 given over to animal rearing and milk 
 production but in the valley areas and
 more protected places you can find    
 crops like wheat,corn and             
 potatoes.There are a lot of{holiday   
{sites,}one in particular is the Perran
 Sands Holiday Village.There is a      
 coastal path for walkers and a        
 dismantled railway.The area is dotted 
 with{disused tin mine workings}and    
 some quarries.There is very little    
 woodland and there is a famous        
 historical site in the dunes called   
 The Lost Church.Close by is the site  
 of the second church which is         
 innundated in sand.
