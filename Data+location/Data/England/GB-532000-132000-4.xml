		<title>04QUARRYING NEAR WEST HOATHLY</title>
		<content> The massive fine grained sandstone    
 which forms the upper part of the     
{Lower Tunbridge Wells Sand}is a       
 valuable building material which has  
 been extensively used. There are      
 several quarries in this area but only
{Philpots}is now working. Stone from   
 the old quarry in the garden of       
{Selsfield House}was used in the       
 rebuilding of{St Swithuns Church, East
{Grinstead}after the steeple collapsed 
 in{1785.}The exposed surface of the   
 sandstone at Philpots shows broad     
 horizontal strata with pronounced     
 vertical joints giving massive blocks 
 occasionally stained red with iron and
 blue-black with silt. Ripple marks and
 sun cracks can be seen and traces of  
 calcite crystals. The stone quarried  
 today is much used in restoring       
 buildings, in decorative stonework and
 for rockeries.                        </content>
