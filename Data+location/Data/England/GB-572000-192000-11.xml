		<title>11    Attitudes</title>
		<content>  Peoples attitudes towards Wickford as
 a shopping centre mostly point in one 
 direction which is that Wickford is in
 desperate need for a department store,
 such as Marks and Spencers or         
 Debenhams.The majority of the shoppers
 in Wickford are local people,and shop 
 in Wickford only because it is near   
 and convenient.The reason why Wickford
 does not attract out side customers is
 because of the lack of parking        
 facilities and the shopping centre is 
 not good enough to warrant customers  
 from out of town.There is also tough  
 competition from larger centres near  
 by such as Basildon and Southend.In   
 general opinion of the public Wickford
 as a whole wastes its potential growth
 as a major shopping centre by placing 
 too many of the same kind of shops.   
 Wickfords development has been met    
 with mixed feelings from the locals.  </content>
