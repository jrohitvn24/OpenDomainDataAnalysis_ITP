		<title>05OTMOOR LEGEND - THOMAS TRYTE</title>
		<content>One dark,stormy evening in December    
long ago, Thomas Tryte was walking home
across Otmoor. Thomas was coming home  
from Beckley Hill.He could see the     
surrounding villages such as           
Charlton,Fencott,Islip, Brill and      
Kidlington.He was walking along the    
Roman Road from Beckley to Alchester   
when he strayed off the path. The      
futher he went the more lost he got.He 
was passing a pond,the wild fowl flew  
off.He cried "Lost!Lost! Lord help me  
or I die!" No one heard.Again he       
cried"Lost!Lost!" Again no one heard.  
Then he heard the curfew   bell at     
Charlton ringing. He thought that  if  
he followed the sound of the bell he   
would find the path again. He found    
the path. When he got home his wife    
and child welcomed him. He bought a    
bell for Charlton as thanks for his    
safe deliverance.                      </content>
