		<title>03YOUNGSBURY ESTATE.</title>
		<content> The most impressive estate in the Rib 
 valley is "YOUNGSBURY" . The house is 
 large and overlooks the valley from   
 the north side. It is set in a large  
 area of parkland,part of which was    
 landscaped by{Capability Brown.}He    
 said of the estate;{"nature had done  
{so much,little was wanting, but       
{enlarging the river".}The estate has  
 apparently changed very little since  
 that time. Coniferous forest has been 
 planted on the edge,to obscure the    
 A.10 from the house. Most of the      
 estates' woodland is commercially     
 managed. A Roman building once stood  
 here and at the 2 tumuli in Hilly     
 field,fine glass vessels and iron     
 objects (now in St. Albans museum)    
 were found. The first record of the   
 present manor was in 1426.The proposed
 A.10 by-pass,threatens some of the    
 land of the estate.                   </content>
