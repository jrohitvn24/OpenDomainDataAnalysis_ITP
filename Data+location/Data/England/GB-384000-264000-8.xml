		<content> In our area there are plenty of broad 
 leaved trees,with oak and ash         
 competing for popularity,orchards join
 some gardens to the houses.The elm    
 trees in this area had been completely
 wiped out by Dutch Elm Disease,and    
 there is an absence of Pine trees.    
 The hedgerows were up to 200 years old
 and no new hedgerows had been         
 established for{60 years.}Many hedge  
 rows had disappeared because of the   
 demand of more crops which means      
 bigger fields,because they are ripping
 out the hedges,this means the wildlife
 will suffer ie mice,which barn owls   
 feed on,and now the barn owls are     
 becoming rare,because of the demand of
 crops is larger better fertilizers are
 added which poison the mice which owls
 EAT.All the hedges we saw were very   
 well clipped so their where no chance 
 of trees growing to substancial height</content>
