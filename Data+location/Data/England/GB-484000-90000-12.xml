		<content>    In Selsey there are a lot of       
{nursing homes. Sick people}come to    
 stay here because there are a lot of  
 big houses that can be made into      
 nursing homes.A nursing home is for   
 sick people who need a lot of care and
 attention.Their{ages}range from{      
{48 to 104}years.The home we visited   
 has a maximum of 23 residents.Some    
 people have to share a room as there  
 are only 14 rooms.They have a bell in 
 their room so that if they want       
 anything they can press it and a nurse
 will come.The residents bring their   
 own belongings to go in their room.The
 residents are{mostly permanent}.Some  
 come from{Selsey},but most come from  
 the{North country}.It costs{Â£160}a    
 week which includes everything except 
 newspapers, hairdresser and sweets.
