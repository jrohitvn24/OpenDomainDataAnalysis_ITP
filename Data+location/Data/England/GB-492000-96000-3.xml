		<content> People are attracted to this area     
 because of the{sea}and the{sea-shore. 
 The beach at{high tide}is{pebble}but  
 at{low tide}there is an expanse of    
{golden sand.}The pebbles were moved   
 here as a sea-defence about 10 years  
 ago.Further along the coast behind the
 beach huts is a{tamarisk hedge}which  
 protected the fields from the sea many
 hundreds of years ago.The{shelving}is 
 quite gentle so the sea is safe for   
 non-swimmers and young children.      
{Bognor Rocks}which can be a danger to 
 boats are situated to the west of this
 area. At this point, known as{Gray's  
{beach,}there are about 117{beach huts.
 Some are used by fishermen ,as they   
 were many years ago ,but others are   
 used by holiday makers.Along the coast
 you will find{cafes,amusements, water 
{sports}and{deck chairs.}You can also  
 find a variety of{sea-shore life.     </content>
