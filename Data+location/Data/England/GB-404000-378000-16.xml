		<title>16A VISIT TO THE BYPASS.</title>
		<content>     On Wednesday 3rd July l985 we went
 to the bypass. We enjoyed our visit &amp; 
 thought it most interesting. We inter-
 viewed Mr. Colliver,the Chief Engineer
 &amp; were most impressed by the trouble  
 he took in answering our questions.   
 Then we were shown around the Chapel  
 end of the project.We went to the     
 bridge that is going to be constucted 
 over the Hayfield Road in Chapel      
 Milton. The concrete supports are     
 4.5metres high taking the road up to  
 the railway above Stodhart Farm.We saw
 where the Blackbrook has been         
 culverted at Castleton Road after     
 being channelled down a new cascade at
 the village of Blackbrook. The bull-  
 dozers,excavators, trucks &amp; cranes    
 dwarfed us as they moved tonnes of    
 earth quickly from place to place. We 
 can't wait to see it when it is       
 finished.                             </content>
