		<title>02The A41 Trunk road.</title>
		<content>  On Wednesday 4th September 1985 we   
 undertook a commercial vehicle survey 
 of the A41 where it passed through our
 block.                                
  We discovered the lorries could be   
 divided into three categories.        
 1. LOCAL TRAFFIC. This included;      
 deliveries to villages and            
 farms,traffic for Kineton ordance     
 depot,animals for Banbury cattle      
 market,traffic for General Foods of   
 Banbury,cement from local cement      
 works, and car parts for Fords in     
 Leamington.                           
 2.OXFORD/BIRMINGHAM TRAFFIC. This     
 mainly consisted of cars,car bodies   
 and car parts for the car industry at 
 Cowley and Longbridge.                
 3.LONG DISTANCE TRAFFIC. This was     
 lorries from the N.W.and N.E. heading 
 for west London or the south coast and
 vice versa.                           </content>
