		<content>  The area is one of{scenic beauty}    
 lying below the{South Downs}and       
 stretching almost to the sea.Despite  
 its beauty there is no one outstanding
 tourist attraction in the study       
 zone.Many{visitors pass through}the   
 area in transit to holiday            
 beaches,Bosham Harbour or perhaps the 
 nearby Fishbourne Roman Palace with   
 its unique mosaic floors.             
  The{Mill and pond at West Ashling}   
 attract a number of visitors          
 especially with its newly developed   
 craft centre.Other visitors may be    
 seen sitting by local streams admiring
 the landscape.                        
  A local concern in the 1970s was the 
 increasing number of local properties 
 being bought as{holiday}homes.This    
 trend has now receded.
