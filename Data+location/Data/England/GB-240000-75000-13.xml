 with some arable farming for cattle   
 food. Corn is grown as a cash crop for
 straw, and to ensure rotation of the  
 land. Other crops include hay, silage 
 and turnips.A sprinkling of pigs and  
 poultry mainly for domestic use - not 
 intensively farmed. Most of the farms 
 are mechanically equipped for normal
