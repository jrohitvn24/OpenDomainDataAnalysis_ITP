		<content> IN GLENRIDDING THERE IS NOT MUCH      
 EVIDANCE OF TRADE . THE GARAGE IS USED
 BY LOCALS AND TOURISTS . THERE ARE    
 THREE SHOPS WHICH SELL ALLSORTS. THERE
 IS A PAPER SHOP AND A POST OFFICE.    
 THERE ARE OTHER SHOPS WHICH ARE USED  
 IN THE BOATING TRADE.  THERE IS ONE   
 SPECIALIST SHOP IN GLENRIDDING WHICH  
 STOCKS CLIMBING EQUIPMENT.  THERE ARE 
 QUITE A FEW BED AND BREAKFAST PLACES  
 BECAUSE TRIPPERS LIKE SOMEWHERE QUICK 
 AND EASY.  THE CHALETS ARE USED FOR   
 FAMILES WHICH WOULD PREFER TO COME AND
 GO AS THEY PLEASED . THE PLUMBERS IN  
 GLENRIDDING DO THE ODD JOBS THAT      
 NEEDS DOING IN THE DALE. HOTELS ARE   
 MAINLY FOR MIDDLE AGE FOLK BECAUSE    
 THEY CANT BE BOTHERED WITH COOKING.   
 MOUTAIN GUIDES ARE GOOD BECAUSE THE   
 FELLS HERE CAN BE VERY CONFUSING.     
                                       
                                       </content>
