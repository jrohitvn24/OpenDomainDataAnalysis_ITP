		<content>   Egerton is served by 3 group        
 practices, all about 5 miles away.    
 For non_urgent visits to the doctor   
 villagers must go by car; a service is
 organised locally for those without   
 transport as buses do not run between 
 these villages.  In an emergency a    
 doctor can reach the village very     
 promptly and an ambulance in 15 mins. 
 There is no community health clinic   
 but health visitors, mid_wives and    
 district nurses regularly visit from  
 each practice.  Neither chiropody nor 
 dental services are available locally.
 Our medical services are adequate, but
 many feel a doctors' surgery could be 
 held perhaps in conjunction with a    
 child health clinic in the village on 
 a regular basis. This would help the  
 least mobile in the community viz. the
 elderly, infirm, and mothers with     
 small children.                       </content>
