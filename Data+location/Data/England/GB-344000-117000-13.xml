		<title>13Changes in our eating habits</title>
		<content>    We did a survey to find out about  
 how people's eating habits had changed
 over the past few years.              
    Most people had changed from white 
 bread to brown or wholemeal and have  
 also changed from ordinary milk to    
 skimmed or semi-skimmed milk.   Most  
 have less sweets now.  They had       
 changed from butter to margarine and  
 they have cut down on salt.  The      
 people we met said they eat more      
 fruit.  When we asked people about how
 much sugar they took, about more than 
 half of the people had cut down on    
 sugar because they were worried about 
 putting on weight.  One or two people 
 had changed the amount of sugar they  
 took and they have also changed from  
 white to brown sugar.  They cut down  
 or changed their eating habits because
 of health reasons.
