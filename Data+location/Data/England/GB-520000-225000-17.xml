 In my spare time I play at the Play   
 Scheme.It is a sort of mobile with    
 four rooms,the kitchen, the main      
 room with games, the video room and   
 the toilets.We also play at the       
 playing fields near my house. There is
 a climbing frame, in the middle is    
 also logs and five trees.I use the    
 trees for goal post. There is a play  
 area in Bude Crescent.Which has a     
 slide, a jump for bikes and a climbing
 frame.We play tennis in the middle of 
 the road and Gary's neighbour moans   
 because it hits their car when we play
 football near my next door neighbour's
 house he moans because it keeps on    
 going in his garden.{
