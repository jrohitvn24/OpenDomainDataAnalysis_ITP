		<title>08HOME FARM.</title>
		<content>{"HOME FARM"}is part of the Youngsbury 
 estate. It extends for over 300 acres 
 of cultivated land and 100 acres of   
 rough grazing. The farm has a flock of
 200 ewes,kept mainly for meat. They   
 also keep some poultry. The main crops
 grown are wheat,barley and oil-seed   
 rape. A lot of machinery is used. This
 includes,a seed drill,harrows,a crop  
 sprayer,4 tractors,a combine harvester
 fertilizer distributors,a plough,etc. 
 Because so much machinery is used,few 
 workers are employed. The farm can be 
 worked by the owner and his son,with  
 additional help from casual workers at
 harvest time. The land on the farm    
 gently slopes down to the River Rib   
 and the soil is a mixture of clays and
 gravels. The sheep are grazed on the  
 land in front of Youngsbury house. A  
 threat to the landscape here,is the   
 proposed A.10 by-pass of High Cross.  </content>
