		<title>13The Fire Station</title>
		<content> The fire station was opened in 1962.  
 There are twelve full-time firemen at 
 the station and fifteen part-timers.  
 The men were called to four hundred   
 and eighty different fires in 1984,an 
 average of nine each week. Apart from 
 these genuine alarm calls they also   
 received two hundred and eighty-two   
 false alarms. The firemen consider    
 this sort of joke to be very dangerous
 because they might be answering a     
 false alarm when a real call comes in.
 During the day the men are busy       
 training and keeping the equipment    
 clean and ready for use. There are no 
 firewomen at the Trowbridge station   
 but there are many in this country.
