		<content>  This is a gentle undulating{rural    
 area straddled between Sway and the   
 outskirts of Hordle to the West and   
 Boldre and Lymington to the East.     
  It consists mainly of{farmland}for   
 cattle grazing , private housing,     
 nuseries and some light engineering,  
 with a stretch of the New Forest      
 itself to the North.                  
  The impression is of a rich fertile  
 land with leafy lanes, reasonably     
 traffic free until you meet the busy  
 A337.                                 
{ Housing}is generally scattered with  
 an assortment of large houses,        
 cottages and bungalows, many tucked   
 away at the end of long drives. It is 
 a broad area between villages with no 
 local shopping facilities and little  
 evidence of public transport.
