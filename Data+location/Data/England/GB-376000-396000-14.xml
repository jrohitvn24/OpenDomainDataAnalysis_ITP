		<title>14Industry in Trafford Park 1</title>
		<content> The area is completely dominated by   
 industry. There used to be a small    
 area of housing at 796 964, with      
 schools and churches. The roads were  
 called 'First Avenue', 'Second Avenue'
 etc. up to 'Twelfth Avenue' and formed
 a compact unit like a village. This is
 now a redevelopment area and industry 
 with car parking will be built on it. 
 There are still a few cafes, banks,   
 newsagents and betting shops at 795   
 963 and 795 966 and they serve the    
 needs of the workers who now travel in
 from outside.                         
 Some industry, such as timber         
 importing, bonded warehousing for     
 tobacco, rubber products and chemicals
 began here because they used the canal
 to import the raw materials but the   
 canal is now virtually closed at the  
 Manchester end.
