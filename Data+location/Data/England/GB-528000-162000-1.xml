		<content>By Neil Riches Thomas More School      
There are many different character-    
istics in our allocated area. The most 
prominent of these is the large amount 
of open space and public playing       
fields.                                
Coming along the Purley Way from our   
school, towards Five Ways, there are   
open spaces along the entire length of 
the road. These playing fields take up 
roughly 1km of squared ground.         
Another characteristic is the large    
amount of light industrial works in    
and around Purley playing fields area. 
There are many small factories and     
large warehouses in this area.         
The other main feature is the large    
amount of residential development      
beyond this zone. This takes up about  
11km of our area especially near Five  
Ways, and it comprises a large prop-   
ortion of high quality housing.        </content>
