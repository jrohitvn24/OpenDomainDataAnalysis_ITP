		<title>13Wychnor Hall and Park</title>
		<content>The only large historic building of    
interest is Wychnor Hall.  This was    
built in the reign of William &amp; Mary   
and some of the stone from an earlier  
hall was used in the construction.  The
fireplace was transferred from the old 
hall.  The building materials are local
stone and oak.                         
Wychnor Hall has been owned by the     
McNeilly family for the last 5 years   
and was bought primarily for the       
beautiful view over the Trent and      
Swarbourne rivers. The grounds         
comprise 44 acres, 15 of which are the 
hall gardens, the remainder being      
leased to a local farmer, Roger Mercer.
The hall is described as a working farm
house rather than a grand mansion and  
has 12 bedrooms.  The main problems    
associated with owning such a property 
are the  dry rot in the cellar and the 
costs of the oil fired heating.        </content>
