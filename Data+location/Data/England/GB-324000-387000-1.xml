		<content>  Welcome to the text pages produced by
 the following schools:{Greasby Junior,
{Greasby Infant, St.Josephs R.C Primary
{Woodchurch C.E and Christchurch C.E   
 Primary schools.                      
 During the{summer(it rained most of   
{the time)of}1985 each school went out 
 into the environment gathering and    
 sorting information.Parents helped    
 with supervision and transport.In     
 school we ploughed through telephone  
 directories,Yellow Pages,and Thompson 
 Local Directories,looking for doctors'
 surgeries,garden centres              
 etc...Probably the most enjoyable part
 was talking to people particularly the
 elderly,who always seemed to have a   
 tale to tell.Of the information       
 gathered only afraction can be        
 shown.We{hope you of the future enjoy 
{reading it as much as we of the 1980s 
{enjoyed putting it together.          </content>
