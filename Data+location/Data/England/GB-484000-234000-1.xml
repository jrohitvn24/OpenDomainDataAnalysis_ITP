		<content>   A5 Watling Street is the Roman Road 
 which runs through the middle of our  
 area.It goes under thew main railway  
 line which is the London to Birmingham
 line.The dual carriageway diversion   
 was built because the old A5 had too  
 many traffic jams.                    
   In the North of our area are the    
 estates of Coffee Hall,Beanhill,      
 Netherfield and Tinkersbridge which   
 were built 10 years ago by the Milton 
 Keynes Development Corporation.Emerson
 Valley and Furzton are the newest     
 estates which are in the North of the 
 area.There are the older ones which   
 are in West Bletchley.                
   The Milton Keynes Bowl is a large   
 bowl shaped area which can hold 50,000
 people.Pop Concerts and American      
 Football are held there.There is a    
 lake called Mount Farm in our area and
