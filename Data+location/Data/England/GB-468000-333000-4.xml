		<content> Colston Bassett has 50 houses in the  
 village, 20 in the Hall grounds and   
 14 scattered around the village.      
 Most of the land belongs to the Le    
 Marchant family who no longer live    
 here.  The River Smite winds through  
 the village which has many trees,     
 mostly horse chestnuts. The National  
 Trust owns the ancient Market Cross . 
 The population is 223. Of these, 20   
 work on farms, 18 work locally, there 
 are 36 pensioners, 28 housewives and  
 76 children under 16.  45 people      
 commute, mostly to Nottingham.        
   The Post Office is the only shop,   
 selling groceries as well. The post   
 box in the wall is marked V.R.        
 Letters are collected twice daily.    
 The bus goes to Nottingham 8 times a  
 day. The Martin Arms pub, unusually,  
 closes on Sundays.
