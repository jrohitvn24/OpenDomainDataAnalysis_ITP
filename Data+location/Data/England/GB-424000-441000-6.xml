		<content> There are opportunities for taking    
 part in almost every conceivable form 
 of cultural,educational and           
 recreational activity in the village. 
 Both churches, the Craven Insitute and
 the local schools are the chief venues
 for these activities.An art club holds
 an annual exhibition in Golden Acre   
 Park.The Bramhope Players entertain in
 the Craven Institute on several       
 occasions each year.The local schools 
 and youth organisations take part in  
 plays,talent spotting and other       
 competitions.The adult community is   
 well served by different societies    
 (such as bridge clubs,men's supper    
 club and 2 women's fellowship)        
 The mobile library visits the village 
 once a week and there are numerous    
 talks,slide and film shows and other  
 such events throughout the year.
