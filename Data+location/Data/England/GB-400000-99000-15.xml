		<title>15GAMES COLEHILL CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content> In the summer we play outside games.  
 I play skipping with my friends.      
 Christopher's favourite game is       
{colours,}two people hold the rope and 
 choose a colour and the two people    
 jumping over the rope say the         
 colour.Madeleine likes{"swing and     
{drop"}.The children run along in a    
  circle. They run to you and you      
 say"swing or drop" and they say one or
 other and we do as they choose.Michael
 likes the game{ghost catchers.}You    
 pretend there is a ghost and you catch
 it. Another friend likes {hopscotch.  
 There are numbers one to ten drawn in 
 boxes on the ground. Someone throws a 
 stone to 1.and then hops to 10.with   
 the stone.You have to get up to       
 10.with your stone.Indoor games we    
 like are Monopoly,connect-four,and    
 stay-alive.We like to play games on   
 our computers.SUSY ROCKALL9yrs.et al. </content>
