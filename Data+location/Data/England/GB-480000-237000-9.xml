		<title>09CHILDREN'S DAY AT THE BOWL</title>
		<content> On Sunday 7th July a children's day   
 was held at the Milton Keynes         
 bowl.There were 1000s of people       
 there.When we first got there we      
 looked around to see what there was.I 
 went on the octopus ride twice.I liked
 the hoopla stool I had 8 goes on it   
 and I won 7 keyrings I went on the    
 pick-a-string and pick-a-nail I won   
 50p. At 4 o'clock they had a countdown
 and let off all the balloons for the  
 second Milton Keynes balloon race I   
 let off one with my sister.Just after 
 they were let off an airoplane went   
 through them.They had 3 sky divers    
 who landed in the arena.They had stunt
 people on motor bikes jumping onto    
 each others bikes.They had donkey     
 derbys for people 5-12 years of age   
 and under 8 stone.
