 size and productivity since it was    
 taken  over by it's present owners in 
{ 1960.                                
 At that time it had a small dairy herd
 of{22}head.The present owners have    
 increased the acreage and improved the
 land,through buying neighbouring      
 land.And land improvement to the soil 
 through drainage and fertilizer,both  
 organic and chemical.This has enabled 
 the herd size to be gradually         
 increased to {140-150}although under  
 common market quota system the herd   
 size is now working at {115}approx.   
   For winter feeding of herd hay is   
 mainly used.The grass over winter is  
 fertilized with dung &amp; chemicals,the  
 grass is cut when tall in summer.The  
 cut hay is turned and when dry baled &amp;
 stored in barn.Barley &amp; Kale are also 
 grown,barley cut &amp; stored kale grazed.</content>
