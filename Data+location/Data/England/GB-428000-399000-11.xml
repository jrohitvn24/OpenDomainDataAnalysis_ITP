		<content> The Old Tavern is one of Crane Moor's 
 oldest houses and it used to be a     
 public house. It was called the       
 Victoria Tavern and Abraham Firth was 
 the owner and landlord. In a          
 photograph of 1898 it had a pointed   
 roof where now it slopes upthe other  
 way,and what is now the side used tobe
 the front.The house is made of stone  
 with little patches of brick and stone
 slates. Some of the stones are        
 blackened because there was a fire.   
 There was astable at the back of the  
 tavern where the travellers could     
 change their horses,but now we have   
 taken it down because we are going to 
 build an extension later this year.Our
 house is in Pog Lane and we look down 
 on Crane Moor village.
