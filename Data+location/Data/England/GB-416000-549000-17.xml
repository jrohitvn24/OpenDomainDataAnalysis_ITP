		<content>  1Many houses built in South Moor     
 about                                 
 100 years ago by the{National Coal    
{Board}for miners,are in a poor state  
 of repair and lack basic amenities    
 that newer houses have.Now there are  
 no coal mines working here so a       
 non-profit making housing association,
 "The Three Rivers",is to work with    
{Derwentside District Council}in a     
 conservation and revitalisation       
 programme to improve the houses       
 instead of pulling them down, as has  
 happened in other communities.They    
 plan to spend about Â£13500 on each of 
 150 houses over the next 5 years, to  
 make them more attractive and         
 comfortable to live in.They plan to   
 rent them at reasonable rates;about   
 Â£16 per week,to people on low incomes.
 This will be helpful in an area of    
 very high unemployment.               </content>
