		<title>07Bawtry New Hall</title>
		<content>  It was opened on 2nd January 1982 by 
 the then mayor of Bawtry, Mrs. Cox.   
 The site was formerly a market garden 
 owned by the Taylor family and part of
 it was sold to raise the Â£47,000 to   
 build the hall. Inside is a large     
 wooden_floored room which is used for 
 yoga and dancing classes, parties and 
 money raising events. A smaller       
 carpeted area is separated from this  
 by a folding partition and has its own
 door to the entrance hall. A hatch    
 from the tiny kitchen opens into this 
 room which is used for the Tuesday    
 evening council meeting. Inspite of   
 careful planning the hall has proved  
 too small and an extension is planned 
 to provide extra storage and kitchen  
 space. A voluntary committee is in    
 charge of the running of the hall and 
 a fee is charged to all users.
