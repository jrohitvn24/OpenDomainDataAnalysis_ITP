		<content>{Eaglesfield Carnival}took place on the
{29th June.}It started on the village  
 green with the judging of the tiny    
 tots in their costumes. These ranged  
 from fairies to a devil. Then came the
 five to ten year olds. They ranged    
 from cave men to chimney sweeps.      
 Eleven to sixteen year olds came next.
 In this group there were only three   
 who entered. I won my section as an   
 American footballer.                  
 After the procession around the       
 village which was led by the{Mechanics
{Band}came the{sports.}There were a lot
 of different races including sack     
 races, egg and spoon, and flat races. 
 Children in the carnival and children 
 that lived in the village got a free  
 tea in a paper bag.
