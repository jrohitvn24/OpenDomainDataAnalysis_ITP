		<content> The majority of dwellings in this area
 were constructed between 1920-1970.   
 Since then, little building work has  
 been undertaken, since the land is    
 desgnated green belt, a small propor- 
 tion is an area of outstanding beauty.
 Most of the farms are much older than 
 1920.A small council estate was built 
  in Ashley Green, &amp; the local author- 
 ity own a large caravan site in Whel- 
 lpley Hill. In recent years, many     
 council houses have been bought by    
 their tennants. A typical private home
 in this area, would stand in its own  
 garden, &amp; would have 3/4 bedrooms,    
 kitchen, two reception rooms. The ma- 
 jority are gas or oil central heating,
 on main sewerage, and many are double 
 glazed. Architectural styles are vari-
 ed, and mostly constructed of brick,  
 some are made of local flint.
