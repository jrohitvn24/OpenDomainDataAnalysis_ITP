		<title>15The Young Farmers Club.</title>
		<content> The{Young Farmers club}consists mostly
 of{young people who live on farms.    
 Every year we have a{competition of   
{drama and singing.}This year it was   
 comedy and we did the evacuation of   
 1943.We had lots of{rehearsals}and    
 then finally it was into Totnes for   
 the first stage of the competition.We 
 got through that,coming first,so it   
 was on to the next round.After that we
{performed at the Festival Theatre in  
{Paignton}where we came last!          
 The young farmers don't only have     
 drama competitions.We have{sheep      
{shearing classes,barbecues,barn dances
{and ram roasts.We also learn how to   
{look after animals.                   
 It is really good fun being in the    
 Young Farmers Club because you've got 
 the chance to learn{public speaking   
 and lots of other activities.
