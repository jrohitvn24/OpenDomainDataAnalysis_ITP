		<title>05Cafe - A.45 Willoughby</title>
		<content>Boys from Barby School interviewed the 
manager of the busy "Sleepy Sausage"   
Cafeteria which is situated at a       
half-way point between the North and   
South of England.  Most traffic is     
bound for London but some is for the   
docks at Harwich and Bristol. The      
busiest times are between 6.30 and 8.00
a.m. and 5.00 to 7.30 p.m. when they   
close.  Lorry drivers may stay at the  
Hostel for four pounds forty pence per 
night this includes parking fees.      
Breakfast is a further one pound forty 
five pence and consists of bacon and   
egg, beans or sausages, bread and      
butter and a cup of tea. Drivers said  
that they looked for good food,        
cleanliness and friendly service.  The 
introduction of the tachograph has     
reduced trade because lorry drivers    
tend to take shorter breaks but keepin 
g a cafe still provides a good living. </content>
