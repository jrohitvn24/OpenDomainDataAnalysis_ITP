		<title>04THE COASTLINE AT AMBLE</title>
		<content> Amble's{coastline}is a{sandy beach}to 
 the south leading to the{Panhaven     
{Rocks}where salt was panned in earlier
 times.{Cliff House}overlooks the      
{harbour entrance,}the{north pier}of   
 which has recently been repaired.     
 Northwards the coastline is again     
 sandy, behind which lies{dunes and    
{marshland,}once the{mouth of the river
 Coquet. Inland the{land is low-lying  
{farmland,}with the exception that     
{Amble itself has grown}towards the    
 coast. To the south a massive crane   
 dominates during the prescence of{open
{cast mining operations.}From Amble    
 harbour,{now denuded of its staithes  
{and colliers}but with its{fishing     
{vessels and sailing craft,}can be seen
 the{ruined keep of Warkworth Castle   
 and the village upstream. The Coquet  
 is{tidal to the weir,}beyond which it 
 begins its{defence of the village.    </content>
