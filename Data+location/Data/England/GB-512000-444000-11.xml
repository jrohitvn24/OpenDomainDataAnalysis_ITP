		<title>11Sigglesthorne Village Shop.</title>
		<content>      Sigglesthorne's present shop was 
 built about 10 years ago.It is the    
{only shop}in the village. Now         
 4 people work there(mostly parttime)  
 They are Michelle Chew,Mr and Mrs     
 Stuffins and Mrs Rowden (my mum).     
      The shop{sells}sweets, wines and 
 spirits, meat, frozen food, newspapers
 vegetables, cleaning materials, and   
 general hardware etc.                 
    Nearly all the{customers}come from 
 Sigglesthorne and Seaton but some come
 from Leven and Hornsea.               
    I think Sigglesthorne shop gives   
 good{service}because it is close to   
 the old people's bungalows plus it has
 got everything you need.              
    Before the actual shop was built   
 the house was a Post Office and a shop
 in the dining room. Mr and Mrs        
 Stuffins who own it now do not know   
 when the house was built.             </content>
