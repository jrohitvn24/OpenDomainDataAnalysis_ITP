		<title>14School Trip,Bradford</title>
		<content>   I thought the trip was great.I liked
 it in the adventure playground.I liked
 the tower best.I went up the tall     
 tower.I was a bit scared,because it   
 was so high.I played with Ben and the 
 two big boys,Roger and Greg.They      
 chased us and when they caught us     
 they put us in prison behind the      
 fence.I found out how to get out.I put
 my foot on a stick and jumped out.Then
 when Roger and Greg caught me again   
 they stretched me.Every time we went  
 over the bridge Roger and Greg        
 captured us,but sometimes I hid under 
 the log cabin.Then they looked        
 everywhere for me.Then I popped out   
 and shouted to them.Greg came and     
 chased me and I fell,but I did not    
 cry.
