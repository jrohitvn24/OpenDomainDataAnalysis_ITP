		<title>13LOCAL INTERESTING FEATURES.</title>
		<content> Apart from the Church at Little       
 Sampford &amp; Spains Hall there are a    
 number of other interesting features  
 in the area.These include the fords   
 across the river &amp; minor streams &amp; the
 road bridge at Little Sampford.Of     
 particular interest are the fifteenth 
 century manor house of Tewes &amp; the    
 Roman villa site at Brickstead by the 
 Great Howe Wood.Tewes is a beautiful  
 example of a yeoman's house,timber-   
 framed with overhanging storey and the
 remains of the old moat.The latter is 
 a common feature of early farmhouses  
 in the area.The excavation of the     
 villa site revealed a typical Roman-  
 British farm complex of the period.A  
 minor feature of interest is the clock
 on the front elevation of Clock House 
 Farm.It was made by John Petit in     
 1778.A handsome timber-framed house of
 1600 is chequers at Little Bardfield. </content>
