 with a strong clay soil.It had a      
 population of 154 in 1800 with a      
 rateable value of Â£900. The population

 The Aldersey family were the principal

 to tenants in 1980.

 stuccoed mansion re-erected in 1811   
 but it became derelict and the site   
 was recently used for 9 expensive     
 private houses.The last member of the 
 Aldersey family left Aldersey in 1985.</content>
