		<title>05INSU INSULATION LTD.,PRUDHOE</title>
		<content> Insu Insulation first came to Prudhoe 
 in 1979 because it was central and the
 majority of Insu's work force         
 live in Prudhoe.                      
 They make insulation for houses and   
 other housing facilities like         
 insulation for walls and the          
 floor. They use Rockwool for          
 insulating cavity walls and lofts and 
 they also use fibreglass for          
 insulating cavity  walls and lofts.   
 They buy their materials from England,
 Wales, Sweden and Denmark.            
 They do a lot of insulating around    
 Tynedale. They get orders for private 
 houses and major builders.            
 Insu  own eight vans, two men work    
 from each van.                        
 Lots of them work away for up to a    
 week around Britain.
