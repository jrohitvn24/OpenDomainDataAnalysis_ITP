		<content>{    The Ramparts of Seaford Head      
    {  Hill Fort }                     
                                       
     These are over 2000 years old and 
 were first constructed during The Iron
 Age.Beneath the{earthen ramparts}is a 
{ditch}which was much deeper than it is
 now.The rampart was 6ft higher,for    
 over 2000 years of wind and rain,of   
 people and animals walking over it,   
 and creatures burrowing in it have    
 acted to reduce its height.           
     When it was occupied there would  
 have been no shrubs near the fort as  
 they would have been used as firewood 
 by the tribesmen.
