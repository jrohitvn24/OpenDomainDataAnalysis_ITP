 6 weeks but he was Deputy Mayor last  
 year.He never dreamt that one day he  
 would be Mayor.His chain of office is 
 made of gold and weighs about fifteen 
 oz.The Mayor likes attending all the  
 functions he is invited to and he     
 enjoys making speeches if the subject 
 is interesting.He finds it a tiring   
 job as he often has to attend 2 or 3  
 functions a day and he even has to    
 work on Sundays.One of his favourite  
 functions was our Sports Day.The Mayor
 doesn't have time to do his hobbies   
 now that he is Mayor but he does like 
 to play bowls.The Mayor's main duties 
 are replying to the letters from the  
 public , going to Council meetings and
 attending the many functions that he  
 is invited to .
