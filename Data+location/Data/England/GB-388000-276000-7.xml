		<title>07Blakedown Ghosts</title>
		<content> There are two ghosts which are        
 well-known around{Blakedown.}One is   
 the ghost of{Cut-Throat Lane}and the  
 other is the ghost of{Ladies Pool.}   
 A boy was said to have been walking   
 along{Cut-Throat Lane}when he saw a   
 hand with a knife move across and     
 down. The strange thing was that the  
 hand was unattached. After he had     
 rounded the next corner where he had  
 seen the hand, there was a dead body  
 sprawled across the ground. The body  
 had had its throat cut.               
 Two old ladies were said to have been 
 walking along the edge of the lake and
 slipped (some people say pushed),fell 
 in and drowned. The lake is now called
{Ladies Pool.}                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
