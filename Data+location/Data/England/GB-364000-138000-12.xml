		<title>12EVERCREECH CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content> Their greatest achievement since 1970 
 was in 1984 ; when they won promotion 
 into the Premier Division of the      
 Somerset{League.}The best overall     
 year,however was probably 1978,when   
 they were promoted from the 3rd       
 division into the 2nd. The club has   
 experienced some difficulties sharing 
 the ground with the village football  
 team.A separate pavilion was built in 
 1973,replacing an older building which
 had burnt down.Ironically{Nigel Cowley
{now a}regular for {Hampshire C.C.C.   
{took all}ten Evercreech wickets on the
 day the old pavilion burned down.
