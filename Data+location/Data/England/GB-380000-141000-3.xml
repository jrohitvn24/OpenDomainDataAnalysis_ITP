		<title>03The Shoot, Horningsham</title>
		<content> Horningsham is a well-known centre for
{pheasant shooting}and about 4000 are  
 shot each year by a syndicate of 15; 9
 going out at a time. The shoots are   
 held on twenty days a year, usually   
 Thursday and Saturday. Between fifteen
 and twenty beaters accompany each     
 shoot.                                
 About 6,250 young pheasants, or       
 poults, are reared and released, aged 
 7 weeks, each year. They are a minimum
 of 22 weeks old when they are shot.   
 During the course of each year 14 tons
 of compounded food and 60 tons of     
 wheat are used to feed the pheasants. 
 The total area of the shoot is        
 approximately 2,500 acres.
