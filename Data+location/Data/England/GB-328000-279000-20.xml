		<title>20Church of England in Clun</title>
		<content> The vicar teaches the Christian faith 
 in the day school and in adult        
 discussion groups. The church in Clun 
 is run by the vicar together with the 
 Parochial Church Council which is     
 elected annually by the church        
 membership. The council elects a      
 secretary and treasurer. The annual   
 meeting elects church wardens who are 
 responsible for the upkeep of the     
 church.
