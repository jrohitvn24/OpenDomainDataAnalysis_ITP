		<title>18THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> IN 1239 a monk called Jocii arrived   
 in Cotgrave and built the first       
 church. When he died he was buried    
 near the twin pillars he designed.    
 In 1346 the church became a chantry,  
 that is a place where songs were      
 sung. In 1412 John Grenlow had a      
 spire built. The villagers were not   
 happy because they were expected to   
 pay for it. In 1900 the new organ     
 was first played.In 1967 the church   
 was completely redecorated, water was 
 piped into the church, the bell and   
 the clock tower treated for deathwatch
 beetle and the hall lit by beautiful  
 chandeliers. The approach to the      
 church was also tarmaced. All this was
 achieved by the villagers giving      
 freely and organising functions to    
 raise the money, so the building that 
 was first built in 1246 continues to  
 grow and prosper.                     </content>
