		<content> In 1985 the small typical country     
 village school with 69 pupils aged 4  
 to 11 will be 143 years old.There are 
 3 classrooms,a small hall,a library,a 
 kitchen which provides school meals   
 and a school house which contains     
 offices &amp; medical room.There is a     
 playing field,an outdoor swimming pool
 &amp; a yard with a netball court &amp; out-  
 side toilet block.Due to falling rolls
 a portable class room was recently    
 sold to provide a clubhouse for the   
 village tennis club.Two women teachers
 commute from Cameley and Pensford;the 
 headmaster from Wells in Somerset.Most
 pupils live in the village but 5 are  
 brought daily from Stowey and North   
 Widcombe by school bus. At the age of 
 11 children transfer to Chew Valley   
 Comprehensive School. The very        
 supportive School Society works to    
 provide extra facilities.             </content>
