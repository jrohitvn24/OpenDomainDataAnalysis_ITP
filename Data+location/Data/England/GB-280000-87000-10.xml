		<title>10LAND AND WILD LIFE DUNSFORD.</title>
		<content> The sloping land still has quite      
 small fields.A few hedges have been   
 taken out to help machine farming but 
 the majority remain.The lanes skirt   
 the fields following the routes of old
 cart tracks.Many hedges are hundreds  
 of years old with a wide vatiety of   
 plant and animal life.Each of our km. 
 squares is mainly farmland but each   
 contains some woodland.Some were      
 planted as game cover,some as         
 windbreaks but many came naturally in 
 awkward corners or on steep slopes.It 
 is unusual to drive along the lanes   
 without seeing a pheasant,a rabbit,a  
 squirrel or a mouse.You may even see a
 hare,fox,weasel,badger or deer.Many   
 different species of birds can be seen
 and heard.
