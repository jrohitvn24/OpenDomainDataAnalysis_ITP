  In the pages of text we have tried   
to represent our "block" as a          
developing area of the Midlands and at 
the same time to illustrate some of    
Cannock's more traditional features.   
After looking at two aspects of local  
history,the Church and the Conduit     
pump,we then turned our attention to   
some of Cannock's amenities.           
Firstly,we were concerned with         
recreational facilities,focusing on    
Cannock's new theatre and leisure      
amenities. Secondly,we considered      
Cannock's industrial development and   
new housing schemes. Finally we looked 
at the provision of communication      
through the media.                     
  To round off the text we took a      
look at Cannock's landscape and listed 
buildngs.                              
                                       </content>
