		<title>09GRETA BRIDGE</title>
		<content> The R.Greta rushes down from Stainmore
 and joins the R.Tees just below Rokeby
 at the Meeting of the Waters.  The    
 Romans forded the river as had the    
 Celts before them.  The present       
 crossing, by a high dual carriageway  
 bridge opened as part of the by-pass  
 of the village in 1976.               
 The by-pass was made necessary because
 the A66 had deviated from the direct  
 line of the Romans and wound          
 inconveniently to the south to cross  
 the river at a splendid Georgian stone
 built bridge (the subject of a famous 
 water colour by  J S Cotman).  The    
 deviation was inconvenient to drivers 
 and residents alike.  The passing     
 motorist hated the mile long meander, 
 especially if he was unfortunate      
 enough to arrive just behind a heavy  
 lorry crawling to negotiate bends and 
 hills.                                </content>
