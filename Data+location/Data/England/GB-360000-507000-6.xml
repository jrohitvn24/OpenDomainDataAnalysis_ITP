		<content>  There are five farms that send milk  
 to Express Dairys at Appleby. A milk  
 tanker comes round every day to       
 collect the milk from the bulk storage
 tanks at each farm. There are ten     
 farms that rear beef cattle and       
 bullocks. There are many kinds        
 including Charolais,Limousin and      
 Hereford. The local auction marts are 
 at Kendal,Penrith, Appleby,Kirkby     
 Stephen and Sedburgh.                 
    There are 11 sheep farms which     
 keep Rough fell, Cheviot, Swaledale,  
 Suffolk and Teeswater flocks.         
    In June and July the farmers get   
 their silage and hay. To make hay they
 cut the grass with a mowing machine,  
 straw it out to dry, row it up, bale  
 it, stook it and lead it in with a    
 bale slave. The bales are stored in   
 barns until needed for winter fodder.
