 Christian House Fellowship in Niton.  
 The Parish Church (Anglican) is a     
 Saxon foundation and has an interest- 
 ing history.The Registers are the     
 second oldest in the Island and date  
 back to the mid 16th.century.There is 
 an interesting monument in the Church-
 yard commemorating Edward Edwards,the 
 originator of Public Libraries.There  
 are regular services and an average   
 congregation of 55.For the young there
 are Family Services and a Tuesday     
 Club.There are regular services at the
 Methodist,Baptist and Roman Catholic  
 Churches,although there are no        
 resident clergy.There is a monthly    
 United Village Service and a quarterly
 Ecumenical Newsletter.Chale shares its
 Rector with Niton.Due to coastal ero- 
 sion,the Church,on the Military Road, 
 is no longer at the Village centre.   </content>
