		<title>12     MASHAM SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    The modern school has four classes;
 two infant classes and the other two  
 junior.There is a large hall,a library
 and an office.There has been some     
 discussion recently about whether a   
 new school may have to be built with  
 the knowledge that 50 new houses are  
 to be built in Masham.                
    Mrs.D.Proud is the school secretary
 and comes in three days a week.       
    Mrs.J.Jackson is the cleaner in    
 charge.                               
    Mrs.Pybus, Mrs.Cook and Mrs.Scott  
 are the dinner ladies.The dinners are 
 brought over from Bedale Primary      
 School in containers.                 
   A new Governing Body of 11 Governors
 has just been established.The school  
 has an active P.T.A. which provides   
 money for things like computers and   
 swimming lessons that we would be     
 unable to afford otherwise.           </content>
