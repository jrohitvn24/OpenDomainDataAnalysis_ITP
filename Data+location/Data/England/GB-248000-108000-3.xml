 land and many of the buildings were   
 until 1958 part of the{Clinton Estate 
 and whilst 90% of the properties are  
 now privately owned, many of the      
 cottages date back over{200 years}and 
 have been carefully maintained or     
 restored.  45% are cob with thatch or 
 slate roof, the cob usually renovated 
 with local stone. Parts of at least 10
 properties include structures over{400
{years}old.                            
   55% of the homes have been built (or
