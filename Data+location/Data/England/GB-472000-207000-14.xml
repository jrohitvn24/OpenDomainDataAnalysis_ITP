		<title>14Shopping Habits in Haddenham</title>
		<content> Most people in Haddenham prefer to go 
 to Aylesbury for their main shopping  
 as there are{good parking facilities  
 and{large shops.}Some people prefer   
 Thame which is nearer, but without    
 such good facilities. A lot of people 
 never shop in Haddenham.              
 Before{most people had cars}the       
 majority of shopping was done in      
 Haddenham, but now people only shop in
 the village for necessities and go    
 further afield for larger items like  
 furniture and clothes.                
 In the nineteenth century there were  
 dressmakers, pedlars, cobblers,       
 blacksmiths and farmers. Now more     
 people work in towns and are prepared 
 to{travel further to shop.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
