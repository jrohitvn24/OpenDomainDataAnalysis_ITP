		<title>01SOUTH-EAST MAIDSTONE</title>
		<content> The area to the south-east of         
 Maidstone is an interesting mix of    
 suburban housing, light industrial    
 development, and agricultural land.   
 The housing varies between bungalows  
 around Otham Hole, council housing at 
 Parkwood and private dwellings, old   
 and new, along the Loose Road. The    
 light industry is centered on the     
 Parkwood Trading Estate. Running      
 through the middle of the area, from  
 east to west, is the River Loose, a   
 modest tributary of the Medway. The   
 millponds near Loose are evidence of  
 the corn, fulling, and paper mills    
 that once worked in this picturesque  
 valley, and there are many signs of   
 old stone quarries. The surrounding   
 countryside, on the Greensand ridge,  
 is mostly given over to fruit farming,
 though there are other crops and some 
 sheep.                                </content>
