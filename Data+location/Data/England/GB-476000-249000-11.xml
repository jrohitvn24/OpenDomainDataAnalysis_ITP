At home I help my Mum in the living    
r om and in the kitchen and the dining 
room. I also watch the television      
and I also watch cartoons.I help my    
Mum hoover and tidy the house and some-
times help to cook.I lay the table     
and wash the dishes.We live in a semi- 
detached house.My mum's room and my    
sister's room is very big but my room  
is small.My best hobbies are collecting
rubbers and stickers and I also like   
reading.I go to Guides every Wednesday 
at Quinton.Sometimes we have weekend   
camps at Preston Deanery.I like to go  
swimming every Tuesday at Roade.I can  
swim 300m and my favourite stroke is   
the breast stroke.I have got a hamster 
and his name is Snuggles.The hamster   
has plenty of exercise on his wheel.   
Snuggles is a tan-colour and she likes 
to eat nuts. Gilian Walton,11 yrs.     </content>
