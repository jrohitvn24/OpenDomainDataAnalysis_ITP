		<content>   We did a survey,door to door,and    
 found that people had many different  
 hobbies. Most popular are gardening,  
 reading,knitting,sewing and television
  Others included tap dancing and wind 
 surfing, and one woman wsa interested 
 in motorbikes.                        
   Many people belonged to skittles    
 clubs and others British Rail,British 
 Aerospace and MENSA (one lady).       
   In school,we found swimming was     
 popular,also cubs and brownies. In our
 class many people had collections -   
 coins,badges,beermats and keyrings.   
   Lots of people had hobbies because  
 they had retired,others because they  
 liked doing it.  One man did martial  
 arts,another bowled, some had children
 thattook up their time. One man said  
 he climbed because it was daring. A   
 woman said she was still trying to get
 used to her retirement.               </content>
