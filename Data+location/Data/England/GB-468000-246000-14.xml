		<content>    We went to the{3 Estate Agents'}in 
 Towcester and asked them why they     
 thought people were moving into this  
 area and how much Towcester was       
 expanding at the moment?              
                                       
    We discovered that many people were
 moving into the area, as it is within 
 easy{commuting distance}to{Milton     
{Keynes.}It is also fairly convenient  
 for those working in{Northampton}and  
{Daventry}and isn't too far away from  
{Oxford. }                             
                                       
    There are about{6 housing estates  
 here, of which{4}have only been built 
 during the last{2-6 years.}New housing
 estates are already being planned in  
 order to cope with the demand. Many of
 the people moving to the area have    
 young families.
