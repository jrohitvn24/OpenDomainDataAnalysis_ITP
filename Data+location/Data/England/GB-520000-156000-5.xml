		<title>05TADWORTH TOURNAMENT:A REPORT</title>
		<content>   Arriving at the{Tadworth Tournament 
 the atmosphere was one of excitement. 
 Some of the competitors had arrived   
 and were warming up. As the races     
 began spectators formed themselves    
 around the edges of the track to cheer
 their team on. The teams were in      
 colours each representing roads       
 throughout Tadworth.                  
   When it came to the three - legged  
 race two girls wearing wellies ran on 
 a false start and could of won. When  
 it came to the real start one of the  
 girls wellies came off and they sat   
 down laughing. Not surprisingly they  
 came last! The trophy was eventually  
 won by Yellow.{It was a day full of   
{fun.}It's the sort of event you would 
 want to enter every year.
