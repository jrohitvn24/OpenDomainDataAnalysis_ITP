		<title>06The Police Force in Bourton</title>
		<content> Bourton-on-the-Water is policed by    
{P.C.Box}and{P.C.Taylor.}Most local    
 people are happy with the policing of 
 the village. The busiest time for the 
 police is at the height of the tourist
 season.{Theft}is not a big problem, as
 most of the visitors are in the older 
 age group. The{drug problem}is        
 different to that in a city in that   
 conditions in the{Cotswolds}are ideal 
 for growing cannabis, and outsiders   
 tend to plant it locally and leave it 
 for 6 months before collecting it.    
{Poaching of deer}is also a problem as 
 venison now fetches high prices.      
 Again, outsiders, especially from     
 Bristol, are responsible. They come at
 sunrise at weekends with their dogs   
 and guns. The two policemen are often 
 called out by{gamekeepers.}Both Wyck  
 Rissington and Little Rissington are  
 visited daily by the police.          </content>
