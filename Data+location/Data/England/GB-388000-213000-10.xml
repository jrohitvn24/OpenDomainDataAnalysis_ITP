		<title>10CHEESE-ROLLING,COOPERS HILL</title>
		<content>TV means that thousands have heard of  
the ancient {cheese-rolling ceremony}. 
A round cheese is rolled down the hill 
- perhaps the yellow discs celebrated  
the midsummer sun in ancient times? The
ceremony may have been started by the  
prehistoric inhabitants of the hill but
it is almost certainly thousands of    
years old.                             
Another {tradition} says that village  
maidens were rolled down the hill in   
wicker cages.They also use maypoles as 
part of their solstice celebrations.   
The ceremony moved to Whitsuntide in   
Saxon times and frenzied races are held
at this time today,often with injuries.
To win you have to run down the hill   
chasing a Double Gloucester cheese     
which weighs 8lb.Hundreds watch to see 
who gets down first and whether they   
are wounded or unscathed.
