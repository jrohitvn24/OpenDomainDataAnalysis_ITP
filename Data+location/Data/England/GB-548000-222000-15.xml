		<content> Within the countryside areas you find 
 that some people work the land and are
{farmers}and their workers.            
 As you reach the villages and out-    
 skirts of Bishop'Stortford you find   
 that there are some facilities for    
 employment in{light engineering}and   
{car maintainance workshops.}Other     
 sources include{local traders}and     
{sales assistants and public services. 
 The{local airport}also provides many  
 job opportunities.                    
 Larger neighbouring towns withdraw    
 some of the work force for a variety  
 of jobs associated with every town.   
 In recent years there has been a      
 predominant growth in the number of   
{commuters}who travel to a variety of  
 jobs in the{City of London}and this   
 has now become an important feature of
 the local employment situation.       
 Unemployment in the area is low.      </content>
