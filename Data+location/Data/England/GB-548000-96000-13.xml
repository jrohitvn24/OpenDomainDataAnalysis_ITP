     Mrs.Goussen has lived in Seaford  
 for a long time.She used live in      
 Seaford,but then after a few years    
 living elsewhere,she returned.In her  
 childhood she studied at a school     
 which is now Church Street School.    
     Before the 1st World War there    
 were just over 6000 people in Seaford.
 There were also 24 Prep Schools.      
     During the World Wars there was a 
 North Camp as far as The Cuckmere and 
 the South Camp as far as Blatchington.
 The security was very "tight".The     
 police came around and checked the    
 permits of the people,if they had     
 expired they were thrown out of       
 Seaford.Many schools were told to     
 move.                                 
     After the 2nd World War there were
 19 Prep Schools and Seaford Head      
 (Senior) was built.                   </content>
