		<title>19CALDER VALE FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> Calder Vale Festival is held each year
 on the second Saturday in June.       
 It was started again in 1969  after a 
 gap of several years.                 
 A new Festival Queen is chosen from   
 the last year in junior school and the
 first year in secondary school, and   
 someone is invited to crown the queen 
 on Festival Day.                      
 The day begins with the procession    
 through the village followed by the   
 crowning on the village green. Later  
 there are stalls and refreshments on  
 the village square.                   
 In the afternoon a band plays a       
 concert while there are children's    
 sports on the green.                  
 There is another procession through   
 the village in the evening with a     
 fancy dress competion.                
 The day ends with the queens placing  
 their flowers on the War Memorial.    </content>
