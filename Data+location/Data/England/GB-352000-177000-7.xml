		<content>    The{Horse Riding Centre}was opened 
 in October l984 by its Patron, HRH    
 Princess Anne.                        
    It provides facilities for the     
{mentally and physically disabled}to   
 gain confidence and enjoyment from    
 riding. It also does research into the
 ways of improving riding for the      
 disabled.                             
    The Centre has an indoor area,     
 temporary stalls for ponies and uses  
 several woodland trails. Further      
 improvements will include a stable    
 block and a reception, a lecture and  
 office area.                          
    About 150 people ride here each    
 week, 135 of these being disabled. The
 other riders come mainly from pupils  
 in the two local comprehensive schools
 who take a{CSE Handmasters course.
