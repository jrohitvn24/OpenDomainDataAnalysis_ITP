		<content>  An interview with Frank Collins.     
  "As today, it was very difficult to  
 find{work}when I left school in{1931  
 and if you got a job the{hours were   
{long and the pay low.}There were many 
 more factories in{Smethwick}then, the 
 main industries being{iron &amp; steel,   
{lighthouse glass,scales}etc.{Canals   
 were used more than now. The{M5 and M6
 did not exist. A lot of{goods traffic 
 was carried by{steam train.}Most      
 people only used the train if they    
 were lucky enough to go on holiday or 
 the occasional cheap day trip. The    
{parks}were nicer, some had{bandstands 
 where{concerts and pierrot shows}were 
 held. That does not happen now.       
  The main{shopping}areas were the High
 St and the Cape, both have since      
 declined.{Bearwood}was and still is a 
 major shopping area."
