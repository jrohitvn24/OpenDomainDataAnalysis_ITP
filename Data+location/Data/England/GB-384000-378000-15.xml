		<title>15THE REX CINEMA</title>
		<content> The Rex was built in{1936 by W.W.     
{Stansby}primarily as a cinema but with
 facilities for theatre productions. At
 present it is run by{John Stansby}with
 his brother organizing the bookings.  
   After the war the role of the Rex in
 the community began to change because 
 of the{increased popularity in        
{television.}The{video market}has made 
 the cinema trade{decline}even more and
 now people only go to the cinema for  
 its special atmosphere.               
   At present the Rex can hold{876     
 people{(338 in the circle and 538 in  
{the stalls)}but this will be cut to   
{300}when the theatre is closed and the
 screen is moved forward. These        
 cutbacks are due to the large overhead
 costs, competition from the{Wilmslow  
{Leisure Centre}who now have facilities
 to stage theatre productions and the  
{Palace(Manchester) re-opened in 1982. </content>
