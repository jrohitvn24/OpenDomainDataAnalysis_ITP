		<content>   Uppermill is the{largest village in 
 Saddleworth, a rural area of great    
 beauty being largely{open moorland and
{enclosed fields.}Saddleworth has a    
 population of about 5,500 and is      
 administered as part of{Oldham        
{Metropolitan Borough.}Local interests 
 are looked after by{Saddleworth Parish
{Council,}an elected body which can    
 advise the Borough Council, but has   
 no direct representatives on it or any
 power to make independent decisions.  
   Until 1974 Saddleworth lay in the   
{West Riding of Yorkshire,}but is now  
 part of{Greater Manchester County}- a 
 subject of great discontent amongst   
 many Saddleworth residents.           
   Saddleworth people are fiercly      
 protective of its{individuality}and   
 work hard to maintain its identity as 
 a community separate from any larger  
 authority.                            </content>
