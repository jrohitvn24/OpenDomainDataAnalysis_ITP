		<title>10Coal Mining.</title>
		<content> The year 1985 is a significant one for
 it will see the end of coal mining in 
 the area.The pit at Pye Hill is to    
 close as is the nearby mine at        
 Moorgreen.Coal mining at Brinsley     
 probably dates from the turn of the   
 19th Century when the completion of   
 the canals opened up the markets for  
 coal.In 1890 the Barber-Walker        
 Co.bought Brinsley Coal mine and much 
 of the land in the village.In 1918 the
 pit was joined to Pye Hill at         
 Underwood so that coal could be       
 brought out of either shaft.In 1930 it
 was also joined to Moorgreen workings 
 but coal ceased to be brought up at   
 Brinsley anymore,it being used to take
 down men and materials.The site was   
 finally demolished in 1965 and the    
 shafts capped.The headstocks are now  
 in the National Mining Museum.A long  
 history of coal mining now ends.      </content>
