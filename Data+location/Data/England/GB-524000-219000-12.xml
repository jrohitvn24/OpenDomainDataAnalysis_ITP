		<title>12Knebworth Railway Station</title>
		<content> The railway line between London and   
 the North was sited over 1 mile away  
 from Old Knebworth, and so when the   
 station was built in 1884 the         
 new village of Knebworth was built    
 around it. The station is well used   
 and has 700 passengers a day, 200 of  
 whom hold season tickets. There are   
 only 3 full-time staff to look after  
 the 4 platforms. 38 trains stop at    
 Knebworth on their journey to the     
 North as far as Royston and Cambridge,
 stopping at 30 minute intervals. 38   
 trains stop on their journey to       
 London, stopping at 30 minute         
 intervals. No Inter-City trains stop  
 at Knebworth, the nearest Inter-City  
 station being Stevenage.
