		<title>01A GENERAL REVIEW OF TREVERVA</title>
		<content> The area provides a rural setting for 
 pastoral farming with a scattering of 
 working and disused granite quarries. 
 The roads are generally narrow and    
 winding which hinder communications   
 and contribute to the remoteness of   
 the area.                             
  The main settlement within the block 
 is a hamlet called Treverva which has 
 a church and a post-office.           
{The block is named after this hamlet. 
  The area has a link with tourism in  
 the form of a caravan and camp site   
 and bed and breakfast establishments. 
  The highest point within the block is
 193 metres above sea level and the    
 area is interspersed with small       
 streams.
