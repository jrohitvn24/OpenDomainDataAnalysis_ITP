		<title>20WOOBURN GREEN-CONCLUSION</title>
		<content>Wooburn Green is an area of great      
beauty in the Wye Valley,with steeply  
sloping fields and lovely woodland.The 
major Geological deposit is chalk and  
flint stones abound.The R.Wye,a        
tributary of R.Thames was used once to 
power paper mills which no longer exist
.It is joined to Bourne End which is   
the end of the R.Wye and is a fast     
growing community.                     
  In 1971 the population was 9,910 but 
had increased to 10,160 by 1981.The    
number of houses in the area have      
increased to 3,844 and this is due     
mainly to single occupants,one parent  
familys and retired people.It is a     
popular residential area because of    
easy access to London,the motorway and 
Heathrow airport.Wooburn Green is a    
pleasant community in which to live.
