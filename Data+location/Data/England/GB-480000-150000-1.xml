		<title>01LANDSCAPE CHURCH CROOKHAM</title>
		<content>        Church Crookham became a       
 separate parish in 1841 and now is an 
 interesting and varied,residential and
 recreational area. Church Crookham    
 is inland and fairly flat. Between    
 Thames Valley and the North Downs,it  
 forms the boundary between the sandy  
 Bracklesham Beds and the heavy London 
 Clays.A large area called Tweseldown  
 is army heathland used for exercises  
 and public recreation.Everywhere there
 are trees. There is fine riding       
 and many horses are kept.In the north 
 Church Crookham joins the small town  
 of Fleet.To  the east lies Tweseldown 
 Common and in the south and west are  
 arable lands.                         
              There are five groups of 
 shops amongst the houses, air force   
 and army housing and Gurkha barracks. 
              A small industrial site  
 is being developed in the south west..</content>
