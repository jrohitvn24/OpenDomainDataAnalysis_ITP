		<content> Cote Farm is three hundred and        
 eighty-eight years old. The present   
 owner has lived on the farm since 1940
 and inherited it from his father. The 
 farm covers three hundred and eighty  
 acres and ninety eight acres are used 
 for growing wheat. There are a number 
 of animals: 110 dairy cows; 15 calfs; 
 35 beef cows; 220 lambs and 200 hens. 
 The cows are fed at 6 a.m. each       
 morning and then milked; the other    
 animals are fed a little later. Four  
 people work on the farm and they have:
 4 tractors; 3 cars; 1                 
 combine-harvester and 1 land-rover.   
 The farm has its own water supply _   
 although today the waterpump is       
 powered by electricity, not wind. Work
 begins at 6 a.m. and finishes at      
 6 p.m.
