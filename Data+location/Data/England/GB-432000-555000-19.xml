		<title>19SOUTH HYLTON RIVER CROSSING</title>
		<content> The area has been the site of a river 
 crossing for many centuries. Some     
 local historians believe this to have 
 been a Roman crossing point. There is 
 a lot of evidence to show the         
 existence of a Medieval ferry crossing
 the River Wear between North and South
 Hylton. Indeed, until the 18th century
 this was the main route between       
 Newcastle and Sunderland.             
 By the 19th century a chain operated  
 ferry for vehicles was in use whilst a
 rowing boat carried foot passengers   
 across the river. In direct contrast  
 the site is now spanned by the        
 towering box-girder Hylton Bridge     
 carrying the A19 Sunderland By-Pass.  
 Opened in 1974, designed by           
 R.Travers-Morgan, the Hylton Bridge   
 now dominates the surrounding area.
