		<title>04LANDSCAPE-RIVER POWER</title>
		<content>In the past the power of the river was 
used to grind local seed to flour,     
Farningham mill produced flour for     
London bakeries until 1900. The        
Domesday Book shows there were 2 mills 
at Eynsford. By Eynsford Ford there is 
an old white cornmill which is now a   
tea-shop. It has 3 grindstones in the  
drive. Last year they pulled down a    
tall chimney near our school which was 
part of a paper mill powered by our    
river. Houses are being built on the   
site. More people want to live in our  
villages. Sometimes the river floods,  
in 1969 it was very bad, it went inside
houses and went 22cm. up our church    
wall. The river brings lots of visitors
to our village. People picnic and      
sunbathe on the grassy banks. Children 
paddle and do pond dipping. It gets    
very crowded.
