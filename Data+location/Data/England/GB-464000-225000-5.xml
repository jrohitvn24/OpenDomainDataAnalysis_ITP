		<content> Changing practices in farming are not 
 only improving crops and livestock but
 they are causing concern to many      
 people as follows:                    
 1.Increased land drainage e.g.plastic 
 pipes laid 3 feet deep in a           
 bed of gravel cause rapid runn off    
 into rivers thus increasing flooding  
 in low lying areas e.g. water         
 meadows.It also is said to add to     
 river pollution.as chemical sprays and
 fertilisers wash into the river before
 they can be neutralised in the soil.  
 2.Use of chemical sprays effecting    
 wild life and possibly food crops.    
 3.Use of hormones in poultry and      
 cattle causing concern as to the      
 possible effects which people may     
 suffer when eating animals which have 
 been so treated.
