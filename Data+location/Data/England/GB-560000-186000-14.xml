		<content>      There are two parishes in our    
 area they are St Peter's &amp; St Francis.
 St Francis is quite a new church , it 
 is 25 years old. There are quite a few
 people who go. About 100_150 people at
 a family service. There are a large   
 number of activities such as:sunday   
 school, pathfinders, bible study &amp;    
 ladies meetings. Also there are social
 clubs. The church is growing &amp; more   
 people are becoming involved in the   
 services. Unlike St Peter's church    
 where only 5 people attend (see page  
 15).
