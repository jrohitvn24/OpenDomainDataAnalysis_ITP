		<title>03Blanche Heriot Legend</title>
		<content> The story set in 1471 is about Blanche
 Heriot and her lover, who was fighting
 in the Wars of the Roses. Captured by 
 Yorkists, he was to be killed at      
 Chertsey Meads, at the ringing of the 
 Curfew Bell, rung every night for the 
 last 600 years. He had one chance to  
 escape death by sending his ring to   
 the King, but the messenger would have
 arrived too late. In order to save her
 lover, Blanche climbed up the bell    
 tower and clung to the clapper. When  
 the bell was rung, there was no sound,
 so Neville, her cousin and lover, was 
 saved.                                
 The Bell, saved from Chertsey Abbey at
 the time of the dissolution, now hangs
 in St. Peter's Church.                
 This legend inspired the writing of   
 two poems and a play.
