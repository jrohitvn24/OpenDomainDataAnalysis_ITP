		<content>    We visited some of the new housing 
 estates on the west side of the B3072 
 between Crab Orchard and Three Legged 
 Cross.The houses have been built over 
 the last 7 years and prices range from
 about Â£30000 to Â£55000.               
    We found that the cheaper houses in
 this area are generally owned by      
 people who worked locally,families in 
 which the father was a builder,       
 gardener ,plumber or carpenter.In     
 families with school-aged children ,  
 the mother too worked locally.        
    Many of the more expensive homes   
 are owned by people who commute daily 
 to work,travelling to Bournemouth ,   
 Poole,Blandford,Fordingbridge or      
 Christchurch.In this group we found   
 company directors,draftsmen,serveyors,
 and those working in banking,computer 
 firms and engineering.Some wives      
 worked locally others commuted daily. </content>
