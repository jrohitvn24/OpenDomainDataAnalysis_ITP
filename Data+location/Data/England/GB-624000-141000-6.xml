		<title>06CLOSURE OF ALKHAM SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  In May 197O a statutory notice of    
 closure was served on Alkham Primary  
 School. Dover MP David Ennals decided 
 to fight for the school to remain open
 and meetings were held with parents   
 and managers. A petition was drawn up 
 which had 1OO% support from villagers,
 this stated that the school closure   
 would destroy the village community   
 and parents objected to their children
 travelling and having unnecessarily   
 long hours away from home. On 28th    
 July 1972 the school closed after 1O7 
 years and thirty local children       
 travelled to a new school in Capel.   
 Transport was initially provided free.
 Items of interest from the school were
 auctioned and the school buildings    
 sold for Â£12,9OO. The buildings were  
 converted into cottages for sale.
