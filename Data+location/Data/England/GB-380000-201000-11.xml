		<title>11A TYPICAL SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> I wake up at ten to eight; get washed 
 and dressed. At ten past eight I have 
 my breakfast (Cornflakes, toast and   
 tea or boiled egg). At twenty past    
 eight I leave for school. I meet my   
 friends in the playground and we play 
 until nine o'clock.Then we go in to   
 school and have Assembly. We have some
 hymns, some prayers and perhaps a     
 story about Jesus. We do              
 English,Mathematics,Social Studies,   
 Physical Education and Religious      
 Knowledge among other things.We have a
 cooked dinner in school.Then we go out
 to play rounders.When we come in we   
 might have handwork or Nature Study.  
 At 3.30 the afternoon bell goes and we
 can go home.We play games outside if  
 it is fine then we have our tea,watch 
 television, have a bath and go to bed.
