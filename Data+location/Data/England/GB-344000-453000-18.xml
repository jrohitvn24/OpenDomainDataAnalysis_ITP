		<title>18The Yacht Basin.</title>
		<content>The yacht basin or marina is one of the
three principal features in the block. 
It covers an area of approximately  a  
quarter of a square kilometre.         
It has, up to the present time, had six
piers constructed where boats are      
moored. Some of them are almost        
permanently occupied by people who have
nowhere else to live. Electricity and  
water are laid on. Large areas are     
available for boat repairs and         
maintenance, and also for boat storage 
in the wintertime.                     
There is a ship's chandlery on the     
premises, and boats are also bought and
sold.
