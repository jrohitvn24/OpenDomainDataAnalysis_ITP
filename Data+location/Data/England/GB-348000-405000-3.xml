		<title>03WHAT WE EAT</title>
		<content> We thought that people in other       
 countries and other decades might be  
 interested and amused or even shocked 
 by the amount and sorts of food we eat
 and drink. This is a diary of what the
 average Junior Shool pupil ate in 52  
 weeks, 1 year.                        
 1092 cups of tea, 728 cans of soft    
 drink(shandy was the favourite). 728  
 slices of cake, 104 packets of        
 biscuits(chocolate was the favourite),
 208 ice creams (mint favourite),728   
 packets of crisps and savoury snacks  
 (least popular flavour, plain). 1820  
 slices of bread and toast, 260,       
 packets of chips and 156 eggs. Our    
 favourite vegetable was carrots and   
 our favourite meal, sausage and       
 mash.  We plan to work out            
 how many kilos of food we eat in 365  
 days.....which should stagger you and 
 us.                                   </content>
