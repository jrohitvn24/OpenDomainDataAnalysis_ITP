 point in this section, Eavestone Lake 
 set in a narrow wooded green one of   
 the lowest.   Between them is High    
 Moor, 500 acres of planted softwood   
 forest.   Streams rise here and flow  
 to the skell and S to the Nidd.   The 
 area is sparsely populated.   A dozen 
 scattered farms and the hamlet of fell
 beck account for the resident         
 population.   One permanent &amp; two or  
 three occasional use caravan sites    
 accommodate people who come to enjoy  
 the beauty &amp; recreational aspects of  
 the National Trust property of Brimham
 Rocks, known for weathered grit rocks

 mixed.   Sheep roam the moors.   Pigs,
 beef &amp; dairy cattle are kept.         
 Pheasants are reared for shooting.
