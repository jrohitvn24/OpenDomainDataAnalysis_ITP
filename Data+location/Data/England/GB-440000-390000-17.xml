		<content> In my spare time I ride my bike. It is
 a red Suziki ER 50. It has five gears 
 and it goes very fast. I also male    
 aeroplanes. The one I am working on at
 the moment is the Senator. My friend  
 and I also enjoy designing and making 
 our own gliders and powered           
 aeroplanes. I take my dog out for a   
 walk and sometimes I go horseriding. I
 enjoy riding because we can canter    
 over the Winterhills. I sometimes go  
 swimming at the leisure centre and go 
 down the slide. When the waves start I
 go down to the deep end with my air   
 bed. My friend Andy and I like playing
 with Technical Lego.  We make all     
 sorts of things from cars to houses. I
 sometimes play on my home computer.   
 My favourite game is Horace Goes      
 Skiing.
