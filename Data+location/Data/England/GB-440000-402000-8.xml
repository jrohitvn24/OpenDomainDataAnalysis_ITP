		<title>08Upperwood Hall</title>
		<content>   Upperwood Hall was built in 1835 by 
 a Mr Beaumont. It has had 3 other     
 names: Wood Hall, Overwood Hall and   
 finally Upperwood Hall. The building  
 was at first a manor house but when   
 bought by a Mr Taylor it was made into
 7 flats. The Hall was not part of     
 Darfield until Ideal Homes bought it  
 and built a large new estate nearby.  
 Living in one of the flats were Mr and
 Mrs Adams. In order   to prevent the  
 old house from being completely       
 surrounded by new buildings they      
 bought Upperwood and have since       
 renovated and modernised its interior.
 In 1974 a school was built next to the
 Hall but it still retains its privacy 
 by means of tall hedges. Mrs Adams    
 keeps her garden in good trim and     
 encourages wild life by leaving part  
 of the garden wild.
