 Our school was given an area to survey
 which is situated 8 miles South of    
 Chichester,on the coastal plain of    
 West Sussex.                          
 The 4km x 3km block consisted of three
 distinct and seperate physical        
 features.                             
                                       
 (1) The Coastal Strip.                
 (2) The Residential Area.             
 (3) The Farmland.                     
                                       
 1. The coastal area surveyed consisted
 of a sandy,shingle beach,that faced   
 South.The beach is safe for bathing   
 and all the other holiday activities. 
 It is very popular with both locals   
 and holiday makers,for its closeness  
 to the village and other amenities
