		<title>06Witherley Primary School</title>
		<content> Witherley School was first            
 established in 1876. It was  then     
 called Witherley National School.     
 Today, in 1985, there are 3 teachers  
 and 65 children. The children live    
 either in Witherley itself or one of  
 the neighbouring villages such as     
 Ratcliffe Culey or Atterton.          
                                       
 Children begin attending the school   
 just before their fifth birthday and  
 they normally leave at the age of 11. 
                                       
 One of the traditions of the school is
 that every Ascension Day, after a     
 service in church, the children       
 receive the gift of a bun, originally 
 paid for from a bequest of a certain  
 Nicholas Bailey, but nowadays paid for
 from church funds.
