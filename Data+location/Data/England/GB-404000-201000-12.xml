		<title>12LIVING HERE IS NICE BUT ...</title>
		<content>  Most people are content with living  
 in the village but many complain of   
 apathy and lack of village spirit.    
 Some older residents feel that life   
 was better when the village was run by
 the Cripps family. There is a certain 
 resentment against newcomers who seem 
 to be turning the village into middle 
 class suburbia. Social divisiveness   
 shows itself in fund-raising          
 activities - buffet suppers v. jumble 
 sales. People complain of the lack of 
 village activities especially for     
 young people, but volunteers to help  
 are very hard to find. Those who do   
 organise things often become          
 dispirited through lack of support. At
 least 12 open occasions have taken    
 place in the school in the last 18    
 months yet 60 village people have not 
 been inside the school apart from     
 using it for polling at elections.    </content>
