		<content> There are 10 schools in the area of   
 Yateley and part of Sandhurst which   
 cater for primary children from 5 to  
 11 years of age.  These are all state 
 schools and two of them are Church of 
 England controlled.    In addition    
 there are many private play schools.  
 When children are ready for secondary 
 education there are four schools to   
 which they might go, two of which are 
 in this grid.  There are also two     
 private schools, one mainly for boys  
 and the other for girls. Both have a  
 department for very young children.   
 The two comprehensive schools are     
 commmunity schools and they both have 
 their own sixth form.   There are very
 many facilities for extra curricular  
 activities, including sports, adult   
 classes and swimming.
