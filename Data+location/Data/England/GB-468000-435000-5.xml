		<title>05Attitudes in N.Duffield</title>
		<content> We surveyed 19 different people about 
 North Duffield.Everybody said that    
 they enjoy living here.The majority of
 people said that there are not enough 
 buses or shops.12 people thought that 
 North Duffield could not be improved. 
 Only 2 people  have lived here all    
 their lives.Some people moved here for
 their jobs,others liked the house or  
 to be with their families.Most people 
 came from Rothwell and Wakefield to   
 work in the new Selby coal field.     
 Others came from places like Wales or 
 Lancashire. Nearly everyone said the  
 biggest change was new houses and new 
 people.We asked whether people thought
 that there should be more for         
 teenagers in the village to do.We also
 asked whether North Duffield should be
 changed in the future.Everyone had a  
 different opinion about that.
