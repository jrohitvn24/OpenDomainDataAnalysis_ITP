		<content> After the Battle of Hastings,William  
 crowned himself king of England.He set
 about dividing up parts of the country
 and giving it to people who had helped
 him.Also this would have been a way of
 making sure the Barons remained loyal 
 to him.One such Baron, called Maigno  
 the Breton,a mercenary,who assisted   
 William, was given the area around    
 Chalfont.It is probable that Chenies  
 was included in this area,although    
 there is no mention of it in the      
 Domesday Survey of 1086.              
 Originally Chenies was called         
 Isenhampstead,a Saxon name.The first  
 mention of Isenhampstead is in 1165   
 when it was held by the               
 Knight,Alexander de Isenhampstead.He  
 was probably the ancestor of Alexander
 Cheyne who lived there during the     
 13th. Century.For many years Chenies  
 was know as Isenhampstead-Cheyne.     </content>
