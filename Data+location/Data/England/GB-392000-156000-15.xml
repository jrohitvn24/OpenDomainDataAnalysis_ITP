		<title>15RECREATION - RETIREMENT</title>
		<content> We came to Keevil because the house   
 offered ground floor accommodation for
 an 80yr old mother. Before long I was 
 asked to be Treasurer of the PCC. Be- 
 sides preparing accounts, there are   
 bills to be paid, contractors to be   
 seen, estimates obtained and active   
 support given to fund raising events. 
 An invitation to become Secretary of  
 the Village Hall Committee extended to
 being custodian of keys, general works
 overseer, poster artist and deputy    
 treasurer with additional respon-     
 sibilities for dealing with heating,  
 lighting and drainage emergencies. I  
 audit the accounts for the Silver     
 Threads (an old peoples group),prepare
 accounts for the Meals on Wheels      
 organiser, and help to record a quart-
 erly Physically Handicapped magazine  
 on tape for the blind.I attend monthly
 meetings of the Gramophone Society.   </content>
