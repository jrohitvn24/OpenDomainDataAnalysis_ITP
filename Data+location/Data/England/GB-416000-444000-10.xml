		<title>10FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> In Otley the majority of families have
  two children. Mostly mother and      
 father both work. Only parents and    
 their children live together. An      
 average house has a kitchen, lounge,  
 dining area, bathroom and three       
 bedrooms. Most children help their    
 parents around the  house. All the    
 families have an evening meal together
 and regular outings.                  
    Most children attend state schools.
 From the age of five until they are   
 sixteen this is compulsory. In this   
 area they attend first school then a  
 middle school; after that in this area
 they go to Prince Henry's Grammar     
 school which is a comprehensive.
