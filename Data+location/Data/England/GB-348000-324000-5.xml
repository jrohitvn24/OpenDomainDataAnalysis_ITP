		<content> The Parish Church of Clive is built   
 from Grinshill sandstone and was      
 erected in 1885-1887, the spire being 
 added in 1892. There was a church on  
 the site however in the days of the   
 first Domesday Book in 1086 and part  
 of this old building can be seen at   
 the south wall. The tower contains a  
 peal of six bells, whilst inside there
 is much carved woodwork in the pulpit,
 pews and screen. The font has a       
 wrought iron canopy and the altar is a
 marble slab on carved wood. The organ 
 was made by Henry Willis in 1887.     
 The present vicar of the church is the
 Rev. W.E. Ward and services are held  
 once a week on Sundays. The           
 congregation usually numbers between  
 15 and 30 people.
