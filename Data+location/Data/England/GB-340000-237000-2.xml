 found rural surroundings helpful in   
 their creative work. The Madley area  
 can boast of three nationally known   
 artists. Pat Griffin is a potter with 
 a distintive style, aiming to reflect 
 the typical British landscape within  
 the framework of a hand crafted piece 
 of traditional pottery.               
   Karlin Rushbrook produces a wide    
 range of hand blown glass from scent  
 bottles to large bowls. Many items    
 have patterns cut into the surface    
 using a sand blasting technique.      
   Glenn Storhaug is a poet who began  
 printing and publishing his own work. 
 Five Seasons Press is now a thriving  
 concern with an international market.
