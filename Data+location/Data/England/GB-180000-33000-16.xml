		<title>16FISHING IN FLUSHING</title>
		<content>    In Flushing there is an active     
 fishing community which with tourism  
 is the major industries. We           
 interviewed Charlie Powell of the     
 Golden Fleece which a 55foot wooden   
 hulled trawler. It is a big boat the  
 average size of a boat being about    
 35feet.                               
    The fish caught off these waters   
 include: mackeral, cod, whiting, ling,
 hake, conger, pollock.                
    There are 5 men working on the     
 Golden Fleece who have a long days    
 work from 6.00a.m. to 8.00p.m.        
 Now fishing is made easier with modern
 equipment such as sonar and the decca 
 system (depth sounder and ship to     
 shore radio)                          
     You can expect a catch of 50 stone
 when trawling. About 10 boats work off
 Flushing most of the crews come from  
 fihing families.                      </content>
