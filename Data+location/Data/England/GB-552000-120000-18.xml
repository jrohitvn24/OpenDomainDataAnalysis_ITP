		<content> In{Blackboys}there are many very old  
 houses and cottages,these are mostly  
 400 years old and have old tiled roofs
 and interesting chimneys.They are     
 often built of sandstone as it was    
 found in the area.They were built with
 huge oak beams as supports,many of    
 which were obtained from very old     
 ships.Then there are several cottages,
 usually in pairs that were built at   
 the end of the 19th century.Several   
 say they were built to commemorate the
 Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria,as   
 was the school house.                 
    There are three new estates of     
 houses.One is called "Mount Pleasant",
 one "The Green" and the other one     
 "Star Lane".These are not unattractive
 houses and though they have increased 
 the villages population,they have not 
 spoilt the look of the village.
