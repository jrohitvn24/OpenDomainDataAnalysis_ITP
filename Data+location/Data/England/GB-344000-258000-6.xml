		<content>    The population is highly           
 concentrated in the two housing       
 estates to the east of the area.      
   These estates contain a wide        
 cross-section ranging from the        
 reasonably affluent to the very poor. 
 On the private estate, most of the    
 people are relative newcomers, coming 
 mainly from the North of England.     
 The population is also fairly mobile. 
   The council estate tenants are      
 mainly native to the area.            
   A lot of people have moved here to  
 live out their retirement in pleasant 
 country surroundings.  The remainder  
 are mainly young families and single  
 parents.                              
   Outside of these estates there are a
 couple of hamlets.  These and other   
 isolated farms are populated by       
 farming families, many of whom have   
 lived here all their lives.           </content>
