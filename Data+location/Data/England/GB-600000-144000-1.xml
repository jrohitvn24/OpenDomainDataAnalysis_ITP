		<title>01 INTRODUCTION TO KENNINGTON</title>
		<content>                                       
 Twenty years ago,Kennington was a     
 relatively small village on the out-  
 skirts of Ashford. The area was nearly
 all agricultural land. Most people    
 worked on the land or in Ashford.     
 Since then, the whole area has grown  
 in population as more and more people 
 have moved from cities like{LONDON.   
 This has meant the building of many   
 houses, council and private.          
{KENNINGTON}has thus had many housing  
 estates built on what was farmland. So
 our village has changed from a small  
 rural village above the floodplain of 
 the River Stour to a fairly desnsely  
 populated residential area. This has  
 necessitated the building of new      
 shools, shops and other amenities. The
 land around all these houses is mostly
 good quality agricultural land.
