		<content> There is little serious crime in the  
 area of our block. Most offences are  
 minor civil violations - allowing     
 cattle to stray onto the highway,     
 speeding, etc. There are burglaries in
 the area due to the high income level 
 of many residents but no high         
 incidence of criminal activity. The   
 area is policed by a community        
 policeman who operates from Saltash   
 Police Station. He patrols his beat by
 car.                                  
 Fire Brigade - The nearest fire       
 service is at Saltash. For serious    
 incidents brigades are called in from 
 both Callington and Plymouth.         
 Ambulance - The nearest service is at 
 Saltash. For serious incidents both   
 Callington and Plymouth services would
 respond.
