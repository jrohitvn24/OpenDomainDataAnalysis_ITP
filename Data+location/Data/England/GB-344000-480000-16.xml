		<content>{Primary and pre-School} No Nursery    
 School in Storth, but a Mothers and   
 Toddlers Group meets for two half-day 
 sesions each week. Some attend Nursery
 School in Milnthorpe.                 
 The majority of the Primary age       
 children attend Storth Church of      
 England School, which has three       
 teachers and about 60 pupils. On the  
 west of the estuary the children      
 attend nursery groups and junior      
 schools in Levens and Milnthorpe.     
{Secondary} Storth children attend the 
 Dallam School at Milnthorpe. From the 
 west of the estuary children travel to
 Dallam or to one of the Kendal        
 schools.                              
{Adult and Further} A few courses are  
 provided in Storth by the WEA. Others 
 are provided by Dallam's Community    
 Education programme. FE and vocational
 courses are available at Kendal.      </content>
