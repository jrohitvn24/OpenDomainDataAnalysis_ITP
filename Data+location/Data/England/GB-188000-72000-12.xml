		<title>12TRADE - SHOPS PART 2</title>
		<content> Some people do all their shopping{once
{a week}and don't go to the shops again
 for several days. A few people only   
 shop during the{half term}and other   
{holidays.}But most people shop evenly 
 through the week.                     
 Some people go to larger stores for   
 their shopping e.g.{Tescos in Truro   
 and the{Co-op in Wadebridge.}People   
 from far away places like{London      
 stay near St Merryn for their holidays
 and{use the local shops.              
 Everyone thought that the bargains in 
 St Merryn were always good but none of
 the shops give away{free gifts.       
 Its about{50 to 50}whether people shop
 in St Merryn for{Christmas}or not     
{No - one complained}about the goods   
 they receive and everyone thought that
 the{prices were fair}for the goods    
 they had bought.
