 televisons,videos and radios.We have  
 very interesting people on the        
 televison like Terry Wogan. We have   
 telephones,tape recorders and many    
 useful gadgets in the home.These      
 include ovens, dishwashers, washing   
 machines, refrigeraters, freezers and 
 vacuum cleaners. For leisure times we 
 have hifi systems and computers. They 
 have become very popular in the last  
 2_3 years. Many people are putting    
 them in their homes. Children enjoy   
 playing space invaders, you can play  
 many games.You either have a tape or a
 disc with the program on. These cost  
 about Â£2.00 _ Â£12.00 If you join a    
 club you get books and games to use.  
 We have computers in school to help us
 with our work. The latest invention is
 the video disc.
