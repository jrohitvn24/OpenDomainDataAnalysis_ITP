 Although the area consists mainly of a
 variety of farms, few permanent jobs  
 now exist on the land because of      
 mechanisation. Fruit and hops provide 
 a large number of jobs for seasonal   
 casual workers but whereas  30-40     
 years ago several hundreds of workers 
 flooded the villages to help pick the 
 hops, even that task is now mechanised
 and few are needed. In Yalding many   
 jobs are provided by Imperial Chemical
 Industries, the workforce being drawn 
 from a wide area. Also in Yalding     
 Messrs Hovells' factory produces      
 candles and receives for packing Xmas 
 crackers and cake decorations which   
 workers have made in their homes.     
 These Xmas crackers and those from the
 firm's Parkwood, Maidstone factory,   
 are despatched from Yalding. Many     
 people commute, some to London.       </content>
