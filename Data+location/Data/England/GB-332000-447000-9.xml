		<title>09FLEETWOOD PARK</title>
		<content>   Memorial Park provides a lot of     
 entertainment and happiness for young 
 and old people. There are tennis      
 courts, and for the elderly people    
 there is a bowling green. There are   
 lots of flowers and near the duck pond
 are many trees. People go to sit in   
 the rose garden and many go to the    
 park to feed the ducks and to enjoy   
 seeing them waddling about. Toddlers  
 go to the park to play on the swings  
 or to see the ducks. There are 10 big 
 swings, 5 small "high-chair" swings, a
 monkey-frame, 3 slides of different   
 heights and a spider's web roundabout.
 It is a pity that the youths vandalize
 the swings and slides. In the middle  
 of the park is a monument naming the  
 people who died in the 2nd World War  
 and on Remembrance Day the park is    
 always full of people. The gardens and
 flowers are looked after very well.   </content>
