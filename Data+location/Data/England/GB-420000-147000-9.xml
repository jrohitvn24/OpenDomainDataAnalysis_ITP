		<content>  We have a sub Post Office in the     
 village with two deliveries a day.    
 Most services can be obtained from    
 this office. The Army also has its    
 own postal service and communications 
 network. The majority of homes have   
 telephones. Telephone boxes are       
 scattered around the village as are   
 post boxes. A garrison magazine is    
 produced monthly by the Royal Army    
 Education Corps and local news comes  
 from a selection of weekly newspapers.
 All the main daily newspapers are     
 received by the newsagents but only   
 one agent delivers house to house. He 
 sends out 700 papers a day; a small   
 proportion compared to the population.
 Other residents purchase their paper  
 daily. Media coverage includes tele-  
 vision and national and local radio.  
 Videos,books and magazines also pro-  
 vide information in our daily lives.  </content>
