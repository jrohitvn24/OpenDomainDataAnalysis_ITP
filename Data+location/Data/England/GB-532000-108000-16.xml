		<content> At the moment,people wear famous      
 brands of clothes like Pringle,Nike,  
 Le Coste,Le shark,Addidas,Puma and    
 Slazanger.These are very expensive,for
 instance a plain Pringle jumper       
 (lambswool)will cost around Â£20.      
    Fashions change according to the   
 weather,and clothing on the continent,
 but most people wear what they like to
 wear,and what is comfortable.A craze  
 from the continent at the moment is   
 florescent socks!Yes,florescent!A     
 little later people started to wear   
 odd socks,and these were worn         
 especially in 1984.Most of our        
 fashions come from America,but this is
 not always so.
