		<title>07A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SAM</title>
		<content> I woke up at 7 o'clock and had some   
 Weetabix for breakfast.Then I went    
 outside and played on my bike.After a 
 while I put my bike away and played on
 my computer instead.First I loaded    
 'Jetpac' and I played on it for about 
 half-an-hour.After that I loaded Manic
 Miner,I played on that until lunch    
 time.For lunch we had Spagetti        
 Bolonesa.When I had finished my       
 lunch,I went to Christians and we     
 played on our bikes at the playing    
 fields.I went home and had oxtail soup
 for tea.After tea I watched Buck      
 Rogers, then I played on our computer 
 until bed time.
