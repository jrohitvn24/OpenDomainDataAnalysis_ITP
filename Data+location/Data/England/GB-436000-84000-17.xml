		<title>17DANGERS OF COMPTON BAY</title>
		<content>{ COMPTON BAY}is a small area of sea in
 the south-east of the{ISLE OF WIGHT.  
  In the past the cliffs surrounding   
 the bay proved to be deadly to ships; 
 lives were only saved by the braveness
 of fishermen and lifeboat-men.The old 
 lifeboat was contained in a shed,and  
 was dragged down the beach by a team  
 of strong cart-horses.Nowadays,the    
 lifeboat shed is used as a garage,and 
 when ships are in trouble lifeboats   
 travel from Yarmouth.                 
  Compton Bay was also famous as a     
 haunt for smugglers,who often used    
 routes leading from{SHIPPARDS CHINE   
 and{COMPTON CHINE.                    
  Today there is little trouble from   
 either ship-wrecks or smuggling,but   
 the people of the surrounding area are
 always prepared to help.
