		<content>    Luckily for the community, crime is
 almost unknown in the two             
 viLlages.Over the year there has been 
 a certain amount of teenage vandalism 
 _ for example, several of the         
 ornamental urns in Howick Gardens were
 overturned and broken and quite       
 recently the graveyard was vandalised.
 The church was broken into just last  
 year but luckily nothing of great     
 value was taken.The only serious crime
 in the district still remains unsolved
 _ a "break in" at Howick Hall;none of 
 the property stolen was recovered.    
    There is a village policeman at    
 Longhoughton and any miscreants are   
 taken to the Magistrates Court at     
 Alnwick.
