		<content>   My hobby is dancing. On a Friday I  
 go{disco dancing}and on a Tuesday I go
 to{ballroom dancing.

   On Sunday I go to play{squash.}It is
 a very tiring game because you have to
 run around a lot and you get very hot.
                                       
   On Tuesdays I go to{Brownies.}We    
 play games. Then we do work for       
 badges. When we are enrolled we get a 
 promise badge. We are the first       
 Hartshorne pack with ten people in it.
                                       
   I like riding my{BMX bike}and doing 
 stunts on it. I can do wheelies and   
 jumps.
