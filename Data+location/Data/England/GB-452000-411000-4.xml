		<title>04Parish Church of Askern</title>
		<content>   For years,perhaps hundreds of years,
 people have worshipped at St Peter's  
 church, in the middle of Askern Market
 Place.Many people go there every day, 
 and especially on Sundays. Early on   
 Sunday Morning, as people approach    
 Askern,they hear the church bells     
 ringing,and they are a pleasant sound.
 On a Sunday there is also a           
 Pathfinders group, a christian organi-
 sation for young people,led in our    
 area by Mr J.J. Bradwell.Most of the  
 people will know him,and he is also   
 helped by other adults.Sunday School  
 also occurs on the same day and this  
 is led by a group of ladies such as   
 the Vicar's wife,Mrs Margaret Noble.  
 The church to most people who go      
 there,is a major part of their life in
 Askern.
