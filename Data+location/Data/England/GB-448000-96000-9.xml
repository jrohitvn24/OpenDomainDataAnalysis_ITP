		<content>     For 100 years{Groves and Guttridge
 have repaired boats.This winter they  
 lifted 70 yachts out of the water for 
 storage and another 150 for cleaning. 
 We saw a 45foot yacht being lifted out
 with a hoist.Straps were placed under 
 the hull to form  a cradle.The yacht  
 was winched up to hang between the    
 legs of the hoist.The hoist had wheels
 so it could move the yacht across the 
 yard.There are lots of other small    
 firms in the yard including a         
 sailmaker,a yacht surveyor and a yacht
 broker.The marina has 200 berths for  
 visitors.This year a concrete         
 breakwater was built to give          
 protection from northerly winds.The   
 marina is close to the High Street.The
 yard and the marina are very busy     
 places during Cowes Week.
