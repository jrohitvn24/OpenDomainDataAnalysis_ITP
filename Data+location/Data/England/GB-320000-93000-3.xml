     The village of Southleigh is the  
 only settlement in the survey block.  
 The village is sited on a small stream
 that flows into the Coly. Southleigh  
 has a population 203 in 1981.         
     The population has remained around
 150 from about 1901,and the small     
 increase in recent years represents an
 influx of retired people rather than  
 an internal growth.                   
     The village has few services,apart
 from the parish church and village    
 hall the only other service is the    
 post office and general store. There  
 was a primary school but this is now  
 closed.Buses are few in thw area      
 resulting in it's isolation.
