		<content> The area covers a rural community in  
 which farming is the dominant form of 
 land use.                             
 Two villages are included; Platt's    
 Heath and Harrietsham. In the         
 south-west corner the once extensive  
 woodland of Kingswood has been reduced
 and new private housing estates built 
 which are the centre of a thriving and
 prosperous community encompassing a   
 new primary school and village hall.  
 The whole area lays between the chalk 
 North Downs and the Kent Ragstone     
 (Hythe beds) forming the inner scarp  
 face of the north-east edge of the    
 weald. The soil is very fertile and   
 drainage is into the river Len feeding
 the Medway at Maidstone.
