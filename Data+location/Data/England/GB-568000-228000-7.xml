		<title>07WALTHAMS CROSS  PART 2</title>
		<content> They first lived in a tied cottage in 
 Little Bardfield where he worked as a 
 cowman. When their present cottage    
 became vacant they moved in and rented
 it for 6 shillings a week, after which
 they bought it.  Today's cars have not
 spoilt Walthams Cross but the narrow  
 lanes have been made wider by cars    
 wearing away grass verges. In winter  
 Mrs. Turner gets snowed in and is     
 unable to get out unless someone      
 clears the road. There was no mains   
 supply of water to the houses until   
 197O. Before this, water had to be    
 collected from a pump a little way    
 down the road. When it came to bath   
 time buckets of water were fetched    
 from the pump and put in a copper to  
 heat. The water was poured into a long
 tin bath.Electricity was brought into 
 the houses in 1951, just in time for  
 Good Friday.                          </content>
