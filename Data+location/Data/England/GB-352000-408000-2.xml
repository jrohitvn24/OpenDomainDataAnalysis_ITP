		<content>      The pace of life in Shevington   
 since 1946 has changed markedly.      
 Then, children could play games on the
 road such as tennis, football and     
 racing.  When traffic started to      
 increase, traffic patrol groups,      
 lollipop ladies and police started    
 helping.  As housing increased the    
 lovely countyrside views were         
 obstructed and as the fields were     
 reduced so were the numbers of safe   
 play areas.                           
      Then, rates were Â£11.12s.0.5d.,  
 and in wages an engineer could earn   
 Â£3.  You could now multiply these     
 amounts by 50 or more.  After school  
 boys would help on a farm, now there  
 are only about 4 farms left.  As a    
 pastime they could also listen to the 
 radio or play the piano, now they     
 watch TV or play with a computer.
