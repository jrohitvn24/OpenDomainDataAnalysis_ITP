{ }This is how you play some of the    
 games.{Elastics}is mainly a girls game
  which involves jumping and bouncing  
  over an elastic band.The main idea of
{ Bulldog} is to get past the person   
 who is 'it' without him touching you. 
  In the game of{Had}you have to choose
  someone to be 'it' then he or  she   
  has to count to 50 and has to touch  
  someone and say 'had' then they're   
  'it'.{Wall Ball}is mainly a boys game
  because girls might just get hurt.The
  boys stand against a wall or fence   
  and one person has to throw a ball   
  against another person and hit them. </content>
