		<title>02Great Ouse River</title>
		<content> The river runs through the centre of  
 the village. It carries much water and
 not a little mud towards the nearby   
 WASH (entering near Kings Lynn).      
                                       
 To help the drainage of the area a    
 pumping station (one of many) was     
 built in 1933 about 1km from the      
 village. This lifts water from all the
 local fields and drainage channels    
 about 3m into the Ouse.               
                                       
 There are drainage ditches (often 2m  
 deep) round the edge of most fields,  
 and local roads - already narrow and  
 twisting - require some care to avoid 
 running down into a ditch.            
                                       
 A major effort is continued to keep   
 all the waterways in good repair, and 
 so avoid flooding.
