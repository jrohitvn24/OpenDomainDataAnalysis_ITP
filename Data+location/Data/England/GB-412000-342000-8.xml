		<content>There are several old people living in 
the villages, one 85 year old living on
his own.  He has had hip and eye       
operations, helped when he came home by
neighbours, relatives and a nurse      
calling most days.  Now he has Home    
Help two days a week.  Also the W.V.S. 
bring a dinner on two days.            
  Another pensioner has a home nurse to
assist her to bath.  The more infirm   
have a Home Care Attendant to help them
to wash and dress, light their fire and
give them their breakfast.  Neighbours 
and relatives helping later.           
  Our local W.I. have a list of members
who will take anyone without transport 
to the clinic or fetch any medications.
Also the Red Cross will loan any aids  
that will help in any way.
