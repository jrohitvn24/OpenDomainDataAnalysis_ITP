		<content> Langore is a small village about 3    
 miles from Launceston.It is the       
 largest complete settlement in our    
 rectangle.As you approach it you can  
 see that Langore is positioned on a   
 hill with houses and fields on both   
 sides of the road.The village is kept 
 clean, tidy and attractive.It is said 
 that the village got its name because 
 it was originally called "Longmoor"as 
 the land on the south side of the     
 village was open moor or downland.This
 name was then shortened to"Longore"   
 and eventually became Langore.The     
 first thing you notice when going down
 the hill into the village is a village
 green.It is now being landscaped and  
 cleared of the trees to make a playing
 area for the children. Climbing       
 apparatus is to be built and an area  
 has been covered in tarmac so children
 can play games.                       </content>
