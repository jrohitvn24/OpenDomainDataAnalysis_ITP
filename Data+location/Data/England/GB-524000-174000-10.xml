		<title>10 Fulham: description of area</title>
		<content>This area could be said to form part of
'inner city' South West london. As such
it has elements associated with inner  
city decay, inner city rehabilitation  
and inner city affluence.              
    The South Bank river frontage of   
North Battersea and Wandsworth         
exemplifies the decline in important   
industry and the residential hinterland
displays commenurate decay and         
re-develpment. Much re-development in  
this locality being in the form of     
tower block estates.                   
   Whilst the Fulham waterfront        
adjacent to the Wandsworth Bridge has  
similarities to that of Battersea, in  
the main, the north bank is markedly   
less industrial in aspect. Hurlingham  
Park and imposing, high priced         
apartment blocks are the dominant      
features.  (continued on page 11)
