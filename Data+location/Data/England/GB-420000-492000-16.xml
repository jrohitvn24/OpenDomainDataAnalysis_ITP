		<title>16PHEASANT SHOOTS,HORNBY</title>
		<content> Pheasants in Hornby wood are reared   
 especially for the shooting season.The
 season is from October 1st to February
 1st.During the close seasons pheasants
 are protected so that the young can   
 grow.The young are reared in pens and 
 fed on small grain.At a pheasant shoot
 there are usually 8 guns (shooters)   
 with 2 guns and a loader each.There   
 are 20 beaters who beat the ground to 
 make the pheasants fly up.The 6 gun   
 dogs retrieve the shot birds.A well   
 organised shoot can cost up to Â£1000. 
 Sometimes food is provided and it is  
 eaten at a shooting lodge.
