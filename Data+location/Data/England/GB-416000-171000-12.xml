		<title>12MEMORIES OF LIFE IN OGBOURNE</title>
		<content> Life was hard fifty years ago.Few     
 huses had bathrooms or hot water and  
 everyone cooked on a coal range.Not   
 all houses had electricity so living  
 rooms were lit by oil lamps, bedrooms 
 by candles.                           
  Most people had more fun with dances,
 whist-drives and summer concert       
 parties in the village hall.People    
 saved money weekly, so that their     
 children could enjoy the Christmas    
 party and go on the seaside summer    
 outing for the day, their only journey
 out of the area.                      
  Children had few toys (marbles,tops, 
 conkers) but the village boys had a   
 band.They collected old tins and      
{"marched around the village bashing   
{them and singing at the tops of our   
{voices".}They sledged in the snow,    
 warming their hands with tins filled  
 with smouldering rags.                </content>
