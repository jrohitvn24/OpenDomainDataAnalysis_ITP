		<content>    This is a brief part of Gloucester 
 news.It is mostly about the area or   
 people.Two to three months ago we had 
 the{county elections.}People said that
 Conservative control would be ended in
 some counties.Glostershire was no     
 exception.For the first time in       
 100_years the Conservatives did not   
 have the majority.The Liberal Alliance
 with backing from Labour took control 
 of the County Council.                
    On the 19th June a policeman had to
 jump out of the path of a car driven  
 by two{burglars}discovered at         
 Gloucester Old Boys Rugby Club.The car
 was abandoned in Horton Road.         
   {Wotton Brook}on the edge of Plock  
 Court Playing Fields has been{polluted
 by black oil.The ducks have gone and  
 the water's filthy.The source is a    
 firm on Eastern Avenue.
