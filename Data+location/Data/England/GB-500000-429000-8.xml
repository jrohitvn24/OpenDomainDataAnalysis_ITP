		<title>08DE LA POLE : PATIENTS</title>
		<content> De La Pole hospital is one hundred and
 one years old. It has always been a   
 pyschiatric hospital being built for  
 that purpose in Victorian times.      
   Its catchment area includes most of 
 North Humberside but most of          
 the patients come from the Hull area. 
 Most patients are admitted for        
 psychiatrc treatment. 474 beds are set
 aside for these problems compared to  
 45 for orhopaedic care, however an    
 increasing number of psychiatric      
 patients are elderly people whose     
 mental problems are a product of old  
 age., rather than the result of the   
 stress of modern life.                
  To care for all these people there is
 a staff of full and part-time nurses  
 equivalent to 638 full timers.
