		<title>06Butterflies in Blean woods</title>
		<content> The woods are one of the few remaining
 sites in England where the HEATH      
 FRITILLARY can be found.  The colonies
 tend to move from area to area in the 
 woods where the larvae feed on common 
 cow-wheat MELAMPYRUM PRATENSE which   
 grows on the edges of rides and in the
 coppiced areas.                       
 Most of the other common species      
 including the brimstone are to be     
 found in reasonable numbers, mainly   
 along the open rides.                 
 Many entymologists visit the area as a
 great variety of insect life with some
 rare species can be studied.  The wood
 provides a convenient stopping place  
 for many invertebrates which may      
 arrive from the continent, therefore  
 totally unexpected species may be     
 seen.
