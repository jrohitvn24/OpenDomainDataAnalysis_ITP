		<title>17ABBOTSKERSWELL CHURCH</title>
		<content> Abbotskerswell's village church dates 
 from the 13th century and has the     
 oldest wooden lych gate in England.The
 crossbeam was replaced in 1603.       
  By the lychgate is a tomb made in    
 the 16 hundreds.There is also a Yew   
 tree which is very old and is by the  
 tomb.                                 
  The church is dedicated to the Virgin
 Mary. While the church was being      
 restored by Captain and Mrs Hare a    
 statue of the Virgin Mary was         
 discovered behind some plaster.       
 John Lee's sister (Mary Lee) is buried
 in the grave yard.                    
  There are two services each Sunday   
 morning as well as a Junior Church    
 (Sunday School).                      
 As with many village churches the     
 number of worshipers is declining and 
 the vicar is concerned for the future 
 of the church community.              </content>
