  This is on a split site surrounded   
 by sportsfields. It has 2 halls       
 2 gymnasia,4 craft rooms,4 homecraft  
 rooms and a number of other specialist
 areas. Sports and other clubs meet    
 after school. There are 4 'houses'    
 Homan,Bannister,Ellis and Cheshire.   
  The school is fed from two Middle and
 6 Primary schools. Within the Lower   
 School there are 8 mixed ability,     
 'house' based registration forms. For 
 lessons these are split into two      
 parallel ability groups which are     
 further split into three or four      
 ability groups for each subject. All  
 children follow the same curriculum.  
  Option choices are made at the start 
 of the fourth year as the children    
 enter the Upper School. The work is   
 now based on examination requirements 
 and houses play a lesser part.        </content>
