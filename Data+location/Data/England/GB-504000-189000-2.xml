		<title>02BOURNE FARM, HAREFIELD.</title>
		<content> The farm is about 1 km. S.E. of the   
 village centre.It is located over     
 London Clay and is mostly pastoral in 
 nature.The size of the farm is 100 ha.
 and it carries 270 cattle-split evenly
 for dairy and beef sales.Recent E.E.C.
 regulations have caused a decrease in 
 the output of milk and this has been  
 the cause of much discontent.A        
 cooperative system operates among the 
 local farmers for the sale of their   
 beef products.                        
 Mechanisation has taken over many jobs
 that were once done by hand and the   
 farm now employs only two workers     
 other than the farmer and his family. 
 As this is totally a livestock farm   
 there is always some task to be done: 
 the result is that farming in such an 
 area becomes a way of life as well as 
 a business.                           
                                       </content>
