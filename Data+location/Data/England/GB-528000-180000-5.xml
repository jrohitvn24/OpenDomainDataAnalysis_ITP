		<content> Corams Fields is a very special park  
 because they don't allow adults in    
 without a child.  They don't allow    
 adults in because they  may take      
 children away and hurt them.  This is 
 a lovely park with a very big football
 pitch with astro turf all over it so  
 if and when you fall you don't hurt   
 yourself.  Corams also have a big     
 space to play in and there is a park  
 for little ones to play with things   
 such as swings with safety bars around
 them and little slides and horses that
 swing backwards and forewards.  They  
 also have a little village which is   
 for under-fives.  The little village  
 has a sandpit, a waterpool and houses 
 with little slides near them.  They   
 have another part for 10's to 16's.   
 When you're 16 you're not allowed to  
 come in without a child.  They also   
 have a pets corner for the 10's part. </content>
