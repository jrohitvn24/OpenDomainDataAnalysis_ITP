   The{granary}was also built in       
 Elizabethan times in{1550.}The inside 
 was plastered to keep the grain dry   
 and fresh.The machinery was kept      
 underneath to keep it in good         
 condition.Both ends of the granary    
 were open so the chaff could be blown 
 away when the grain and corn was      
 threshed.

 fawn colour.They sometimes get three  
 pounds of wool from a fleece.The rams 
 are slaughtered and the lambs sold.The

 soil is all clay so it is fertile and
