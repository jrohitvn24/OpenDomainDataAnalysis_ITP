 cycle ride has been organised in      
 Bradwell. The participants ride twenty
 miles and are sponsored. The ride     
 starts at 11.00 am and finishes when  
 the last person arrives back. This    
 event is usually held on the first    
 Sunday in July. People who are taking 
 part meet at the Bradwell Community   
 Centre.There is a party here in the   
 evening when the ride has finished.

 from Bradwell but also from such      
 places as Gt. Yarmouth, Gorleston,    
 Belton and Fritton.Last year, over
