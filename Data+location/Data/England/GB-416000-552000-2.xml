		<title>02RECREATION-GREYHOUND RACING-</title>
		<content> Originally greyhounds ran in packs and
 were hunting dogs. They were used     
 for coursing hares and were adapted to
 run on greyhound tracks chasing a     
 mechanical hare.Races are usually     
 about \ km although some greyhounds   
 are adapted to shorter distances and  
 longer distances up to 1km.The N.G.R.C
 was formed so that all dogs running   
 under their rules would be registered.
 All greyhounds must be kept to a      
 regular diet and exercised daily,     
 great care must be taken with         
 greyhounds feet and grooming must be  
 done on a daily basis. The feeding of 
 greyhounds is important.Breakfast:milk
 cereal and egg.Dinner:mid afternoon,at
 least 1lb of meat either cooked or raw
 with plenty of vegetables and brown   
 bread mixed in.Very fast greyhounds   
 can be sold for very large sums of    
 money.                                </content>
