		<title>15GAINS PARK.</title>
		<content> Gains Park is a private housing       
 estate. It was started about 10 years 
 ago and is located to the west of     
 Shrewsbury on the A458(T). It was     
 named after a house called Gains      
 Lodge. The school for the children of 
 this estate is called Oxon C.E.       
 School, which was built before the    
 estate. The school is on 2 sites, 1   
 on Racecourse Lane and 1 on the       
 A458(T) which is the road to          
 Welshpool.                            
 I think there should be a shop or     
 supermarket on the site. There is a   
 plan at present to build a            
 Neighbourhood Shopping Centre. The    
 local newspaper reports that building 
 will commence immediately.            
 There are several different types of  
 houses, for example, detached,        
 semidetached, detached bungalows,     
 studio apartments and terraced houses.</content>
