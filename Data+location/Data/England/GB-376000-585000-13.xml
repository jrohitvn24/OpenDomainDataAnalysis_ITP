		<content> Greystead is not so much a hamlet,    
 more a straggle of dwellings          
 stretching from Low to West Greystead 
 (now known as the Moorcock Inn).      
 Formerly there was a school, post     
 office and church.  Now the school and
 post office are closed and converted  
 to private homes.  The telephone kiosk
 has been removed and the church is    
 only used for weddings and funerals.  
 Nowadays most activity centres on the 
 Hott Farm run by the Dagg family and  
 the Moorcock Inn where the Blaylocks  
 are building up a reputation for bar  
 meals.  The Rectory with its two      
 cottages is up for sale and the former
 church institute stands neglected.    
 10 dwellings-8 detached, 2 semi-det:  
  2: working families w/ children      
  2:   "        "     w/0  "           
  4: elderly or retired people         
  2: vacant                            </content>
