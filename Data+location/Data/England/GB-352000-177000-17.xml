		<title>17ST. BEDES "GORAM FAIR"</title>
		<content>  Once a year, St. Bedes has a{fund    
{raising event}for the school called   
{GORAM FAIR.}A chairman is elected out 
 of the{Parent Teacher Association.}The
 person then organises the events for  
 the year.                             
{ GORAM FAIR}has many stalls and side  
 shows eg. Hoop-la, White Elephant,    
 Skittles, etc. Events also take place 
 at GORAM FAIR eg "It's a Knockout",   
 Fencing and many others. The fair     
 raises more money for the school to   
 buy more equipment, because the grant 
 for the equipment is not sufficient.  
{ GORAM FAIR}is also very good because 
 it attracts all the local people. In  
 this area there are not many such     
 events so they are well supported.    
 Lots of people like to help organise  
 our school events which is good       
 because much help is needed.
