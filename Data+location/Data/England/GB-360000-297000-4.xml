		<title>04A day in the life of Helen.</title>
		<content> Every morning I get up and get dressed
 for school. After breakfast I get in  
 the car and go to school. School      
 starts at 9 o'clock. The teacher takes
 the registers and then we have        
 assembly. After assembly we do maths. 
 We have playtime at 10:30. After      
 playtime we do some work. The bell    
 goes at 12:00 when we have lunch.     
 Lunch time finishes at 1:15. We go in 
 and read quietly. After reading we do 
 some more work. The bell goes at 3:00 
 for Bases 1 and 2 to go home and at   
 3:30 we go home. When I get home I go 
 to play with Faye who lives near me.  
 On Tuesdays I go to Brownies in Much  
 Wenlock. On Wednesdays I go to ballet 
 classes at the Sports Centre in       
 Bridgnorth and on Thursdays I go to   
 gymnastics at the Sports Centre in    
 Much Wenlock. At the weekend we go    
 shopping and I play with my friends.  </content>
