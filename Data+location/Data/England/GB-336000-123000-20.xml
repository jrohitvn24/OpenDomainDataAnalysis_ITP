		<title>20Housing in Curry Rivel</title>
		<content> The houses in 1985 have changed       
 considerably since the time of the    
 original Doomsday Book. Curry Rivel is
 a big village with many people moving 
 in and out. The oldest house in the   
 village is Hillards Farm, the house   
 was built in the 11th century. In West
 Curry Rivel the most popular buildings
 are 17th century stone detached houses
 with tile rooves. In East Curry Rivel 
 most buildings are 20th century       
 detached houses made of reconstituted 
 stone with tile rooves. The most      
 common buildings in Central Curry     
 Rivel are late 18th century,          
 semi-detached houses, made of stone   
 with tile rooves. The stone used to   
 make the houses comes from quarries on
 Ham Hill about 10 miles away. The     
 majority of new houses are found in   
 East Curry Rivel and the pre-18th     
 century buildings are in West Curry.  </content>
