		<content> The area is divided into two          
 topographical parts by a fault.The    
 Northern third ,part of the Bovey     
 Basin,is ball clay and sand,and there 
 fore flat.The ridge rising steeply to 
 the South runs from East to West      
 culminating in Ingsdon and Telegraph  
 Hills in the West.Formed from Devonian
 slate and capped by basalt,this upland
 provides pasture which supports dairy 
 farming.Seale Hayne Agricultural      
 College uses much of this land.The A38
 trunk road cuts diagonally through the
 area,bounding the lower S.E.slopes of 
 Dartmoor,and links the area to Exeter 
 and Plymouth.Proximity to the A38 has 
 caused development at Coldeast,Trago  
 Mills regional shopping centre and    
 Youngs Seafoods.Local communities and 
 farms are served by Newton Abbot and  
 Ashburton(secondary),Blackpool(junior)
 and Stover Girls (private) schools.   </content>
