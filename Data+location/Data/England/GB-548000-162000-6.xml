appearance so you have to be careful.  
 At the moment the girls are wearing   
blouses with flowers on and a skirt to 
match.If they have a great deal of     
money  to spend they wear leather      
suits.The boys wear jeans and T-shirts 
in the T-Bag style.T-Bags are shirts   
 ith holes in them and the sleeves cut 
off. Break Dancers wear shiny          
tracksuits and basketball              
boots.Girls sometimes wear a material  
in the shape of a tube that covers the 
whole body.  Some girls and boy wear   
make up, long earings with materials   
in their hair.Some have their hair     
sprayed to match their costumes.       
Others dye their hair with a lasting   
colour.Fashions seem to come and go    
and if you want to keep up with the    
trends you have to be quick.           </content>
