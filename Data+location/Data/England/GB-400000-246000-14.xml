		<content>   By about 1940 Wood Norton was       
 producing about 835 hours of          
 broadcasting,making it one of the     
 biggest broadcasting centres in Europe
   During the war many famous people   
 broadcasted from Wood Norton (too many
 to list).                             
   On the 4th of September 1940 Wood   
 Norton was struck by a great fire and 
 because of a drought water had to be  
 taken from the river.Not long after   
 the fire was put out a temporary roof 
 was put on and things got back to     
 normal.                               
   After the war Wood Norton became a  
 training establishment and now has all
 of the equipment needed.
