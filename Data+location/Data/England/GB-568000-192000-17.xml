		<content> Motor_bikes generally appeal to people
 of all ages. I own a motor_bike of my 
 own. I use it in the back garden of my
 home which is fortunately large enough
 to do lots of jumps and obstacle      
 courses. The bike's top speed is 30mph
 There are four different kinds of     
 racing ; dirt_track racing,general    
 racing, side_car racing and scrambling
 My bike is used for scrambling. You   
 will find that many young people have 
 motor_bikes. It is becoming a craze   
 and I think that what has inspired    
 people, is the B.B.C.'S programme     
 'Kick Start',in which children from   
 about 9 to 15 years try to go over a  
 scrambling course in the fastest      
 possible time. My motor_bike is called
 a'Punch'. It is specially built for   
 young people as it is only half the   
 size of a normal scrambling bike.
