		<content>        Farming is the major industry  
in this area.Most of the land is for   
crops like wheat, barley, peas, beans, 
sugar beet. In some places the         
countryside is open with only a few    
hedges but some farmers have been      
planting more trees recenty.If you     
look on old maps you will see where    
many hedges were.                      
     A farmer in Thwaite told us about 
his farm of 700 acres. He told us that 
he likes living here because he likes  
the peace and quiet of the countryside.
     A different farmer grows          
wheat, barley, beans and corn.He has a 
small farm of about 150 acres. He told 
us that his farm is 600 years old.     
     Another farmer has a farm of 333  
acres.He keeps 80 beef cattle. One of  
the crops he grows is oil seed rape.   
This is used to make margarine.
