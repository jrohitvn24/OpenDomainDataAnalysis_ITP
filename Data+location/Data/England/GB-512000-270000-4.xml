 In our area, very few people have been
 unemployed during the last five years.
 Alarge majority work outside our      
 survey area.The average distance      
 travelled to work is 23 miles, mostly 
 covered by car or train, but one      
 business man flies more than 100,000  
 miles each year,while another man     
 walks only 6 metres to his garden     
 shed.Most of the men have management  
 or executive_type jobs, but other jobs
 include a wood turner and farmers.Many
 people moved to this area because it  
 is easy to commute to Londonand the A1
 is nearby, and also housing is not too
 expensive. Other main places of       
 employment are R.A.F.Brampton and the 
 USAF base ar Alconbury.
