		<title>01Preview of The Northill Area</title>
		<content> Once part of the{Wixamtree Hundred,   
 most of the area, except for the out- 
 skirts of Moggerhanger, now falls     
 within the administrative{Parish of   
{Northill.} The land is low-lying: the 
 highest point is Mox Hill in the West 
 at 68m, the site of underground reser-
 voirs, &amp; the lowest is in the North at
 23m. The soil is fertile, and used for
 agriculture. There is some meadowland 
 and College, Home &amp; Sheerhatch Woods  
 constitute the main areas of woodland.
 The{village of Northill}is fairly     
 small; the church of St. Mary Virgin  
 stands in the centre of a Conservation
 Area surrounded by a public house, The
 Old Rectory, school and village hall. 
 To the north are the hamlets of{Thorn-
{cote,}a group of houses of varying age
 around a green, and{Hatch}with an old 
 farmhouse, and renovated cottages. The
 whole embraces a small rural community</content>
