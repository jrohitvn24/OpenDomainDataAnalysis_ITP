		<title>15Conservation in Shelsley</title>
		<content>   The temperature in the valley is    
 usually recognised as being slightly  
 higher than in the surrounding        
 countryside. Average rainfall 400'    
 above the valley was 2.29" measured   
 over nine years.                      
   The Shelsleys is a clean area as far
 as{water pollution}is concerned.      
 Supplies are monitored at Stanford    
 Bridge and tests reveal virtually no  
 organic or toxic metal pollution, nor 
 any great problem from pesticides or  
 herbicides. Recently increasing levels
 of nitrates now seem to be levelling  
 off.                                  
   Under the auspices of the{Worcs.    
{Trust for nature conservation}a       
 reserve is maintained at{Penny Hill   
{Bank.}General conservation includes   
 mechanical cutting of hedges, cutting 
 verges of only one yard and reshaping 
 river banks.                          </content>
