		<content> At{Michael Syddall School}the children
 do a variety of school work.This      
 includes work on interesting projects.
 The older pupils have recently been   
 working on their{"Birmingham Project".
 We have established links with        
 Somerville Primary School in Small    
 Heath.The school is in central        
 Birmingham and most of the pupils are 
 from the Asian community.Pupils write 
 to each other,and visit each other's  
 school.In 1985 we had our first shared
 visit to a North Yorkshire Residential
 Field Centre.                         
 The school has a strong musical       
 tradition with many children playing  
 instruments.A{school orchestra}plays  
 for assemblies each morning.          
 Each year there is a Cross_Country    
 Race for the Junior Boys and Girls.   
 There are also Infant and Junior      
 Sports Days.                          </content>
