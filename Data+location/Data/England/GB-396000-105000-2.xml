		<content> The land surrounding the village is   
 used for agriculture,forestry, game   
 rearing and recreation and is crossed 
 by a Roman Road.Now there is a network
 of narrow roads serving the village   
 and scattered dwellings and farms.    
 there is one ancient bridge over the  
 River Allen built in the reign of     
 George III. The River Allen is a      
 meandering river which provides       
 water for the mill and meadows for    
 grazing.The river also supports       
 a wealth of wildlife.The predominance 
 of chalk in the terrain allows good   
 drainage and a very alkaline soil.    
 A large proportion of older houses    
 are owned by Crichel Estates,the main 
 land owner in the area. There are also
 two pockets of council houses and the 
 rest are privately owned with only    
 three new buildings erected in the    
 last decade.                          </content>
