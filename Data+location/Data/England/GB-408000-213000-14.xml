		<title>14EMPLOYMENT- A FIREWOMAN</title>
		<content> Miss Manning decided to become a      
 firewoman because in the newspaper    
 there were lots of reports saying that
 there were not enough firemen in      
 Northleach and because of that the    
 station would have to close down.     
  She thought that she could do the    
 job, applied and was put on a course  
 for one month to train to become a    
 firewoman. She was not teased by the  
 men because she was one of two women  
 at Northleach fire station.           
  They get called out about 12 times a 
 month and about 90 times a year. She  
 has driven the fire engine but she had
 to take a special test for heavy goods
 vehicles. The worst fire she had been 
 to was a tractor fire. When they do go
 to fires they have to wear special    
 breathing apparatus.
