		<title>08Witherley Church Restoration</title>
		<content> St Peter's Church has been standing in
 Witherley for 500 years. The spire is 
 156 feet high, and was built in about 
 1350. It has a weathercock on the top.
                                       
 In 1924 the spire was struck by       
 lightning, and it caved in through the
 roof of the church. The Duke of York  
 happened to pass by Witherley, and    
 when he saw the damage that the       
 lightning had done to the spire he    
 gave a donation towards its repair.   
                                       
 In 1985 the church needs repairing    
 again. When Queen Elizabeth the Queen 
 Mother (widow of the same Duke of York
 who later became King George VI) heard
 of this, she also gave a donation to  
 the Restoration Fund.
