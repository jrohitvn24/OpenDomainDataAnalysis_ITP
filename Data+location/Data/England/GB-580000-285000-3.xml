		<title>03SANTON DOWNHAM VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Santon Downham has a population of    
 about 300 and is linked by a crescent 
 shaped unclassified road to the B1107.
 There is some controversy over the    
 name but it is basically Sand_tun_    
 village on sandy soil and Dun_ham_    
 village on a hill or slope, as the    
 surrounding land is gently undulating 
 between 5 and 50m. The village, prior 
 to F.C. takeover, was a feudal estate 
 system centred around Downham Hall,   
 now demolished. The old buildings are 
 mostly near the river, with F.C.      
 housing stretched along the north side
 of the village green.                 
 The population is concerned that      
 whereas attractions like Nature Trails
 bring many visitors, the plans for a  
 commercial caravan site about 2 miles 
 away will bring unwelcome intrusions.
