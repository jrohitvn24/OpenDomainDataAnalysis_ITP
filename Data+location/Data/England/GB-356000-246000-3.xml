		<content> The majority of houses are of red     
 brick but many are also of stone, or  
 of black and white timber and plaster.
 Roofs are mainly slate, and all have  
 septic tanks which the owners are     
 responsible for emptying.  The        
 majority have mains electricity and   
 water although a proportion still have
 their own wells.  Most houses have    
 large gardens.  Houses are either     
 owner-occupied, rented, or tied to a  
 farm - the latter being in the        
 minority.  Rented houses belong either
 to the local authority or to private  
 landlords.  Services available to all 
 properties are postal, telephone, bus,
 milk delivery, bread delivery and the 
 mobile library.  Rates are paid to the
 Malvern Hills District Council.  A few
 houses have been bought for use as    
 holiday homes, and others are rented  
 out as holiday cottages or flats.     </content>
