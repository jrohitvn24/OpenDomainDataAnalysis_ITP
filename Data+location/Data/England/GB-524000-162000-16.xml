		<content> Queen Mary's was opened in l9O9 as a  
 long stay children's hospital, but was
 named in l9l4 when Queen Mary became a
 Patron. 3O years later it became a    
 general children's hospital. In l959  
 it amalgamated with a hospital for    
 mentally handicapped children, forming
 the first comprehensive children's    
 hospital in the UK. It now has 24O    
 mentally handicapped beds, 2O6 paedia_
 tric beds and 26 psychiatric beds. The
 wards are in bungalows set in 9O      
 acres. The mentally handicapped people
 stay even when they reach l7 but the  
 paediatric move to other hospitals.   
 There are units for further education 
 and training and a special one for    
 disturbed residents. Radio Lollipop   
 provides support to patients and      
 staff.A recreation dept. and a toy    
 library provides play therapy aided by
 strong voluntary support.             </content>
