		<title>01Daglingworth Area</title>
		<content>   The 12 square kilometre block we    
 have studied includes the small rural 
 communities of Duntisbourne Rouse,    
 Middle Duntisbourne and the larger    
 village of Daglingworth. Much of the  
 farm land surrounding the villages    
 belongs to the Duchy  of Cornwall, and
 is farmed by tenant farmers.          
   Part of the area is covered by  the 
 woodlands of Daglingworth Park,       
 leading into the Estate of Cirencester
 Park which belongs to Lord Bathurst.  
 These woodlands provide a valuable    
 recreation area, and are open to the  
 public who may walk or ride there.    
   The villages consist mainly of old  
 houses and cottages, built of the     
 local limestone in tbe typical        
 attractive Cotswold style. There are  
 very few modern houses and no housing 
 estates of any kind.
