		<title>10Housing in Kinver</title>
		<content>     There is a variety of old and new 
housing. The High Street contains      
Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian      
Houses. Several have been recently     
restored. The Old Grammar School was   
built in the 17th century and is now a 
house.                                 
     Many modern houses have been built
in recent years and there are some     
small housing estates. Some of these   
are council houses but most houses in  
Kinver are privately owned.            
     There are many more shops and     
banks than ten years ago and public    
houses are very common.                
     The most interesting houses are   
the Holy Austin rock houses but these  
are in the next block to the west.
