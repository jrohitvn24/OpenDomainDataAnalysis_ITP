		<title>03Crowton Hall Farm</title>
		<content>  Crowton Hall is a large dairy farm of
 120 hectares.  The farm is owned by   
 the Wilbraham Estate and Mr. Stubbs is
 the tenant.                           
  Mr. Stubbs keeps 200 cattle and 600  
 sheep.  He buys sheep after the       
 harvest to feed on the barley fields  
 and then he sells them in the spring  
 for meat.  The farm has 100 Friesian  
 cows which are milked in a parlour.   
 Concentrates are fed automatically and
 one man can milk 80 cows an hour.  A  
 good cow will give 6000 litres of milk
 in a lactation.                       
  After birth calves are kept with the 
 cow for 3 days and then they are fed  
 dried milk and concentrates.  The     
 heifers are kept to replace the       
 milking herd and the bulls are sold   
 for meat at 11 months old.  Cereal    
 crops and grass are grown for cattle  
 feed. Silage is made for winter feed. </content>
