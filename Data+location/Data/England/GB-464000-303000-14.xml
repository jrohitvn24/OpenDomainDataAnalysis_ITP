		<content> Our school is called St.Luke's.The    
 original building was opened in 1865. 
 You can read about what used to happen
 then in the log book.It is very       
 interesting.The new building was      
 opened in 1958.The village hall is    
 used for school hall activities.There 
 are 128 children from 4-10 and a staff
 of 5 teachers,including the           
 headteacher,plus a part time teacher  
 who takes French.                     
 Outings from school include a week for
 7 year olds at Church Langton,a field 
 study centre and a week at Woodchester
 in Gloucestershire for the oldest     
 children.Local visits are made to     
 Twycross zoo where the famous chimps  
 who have tea on TV can be seen.We also
 visit famous local houses such as     
 Belton.
