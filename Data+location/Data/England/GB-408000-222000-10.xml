		<title>10GUITING POWER.BROWNIE PACK</title>
		<content>    The Brownie Movement is 75 years   
 old this year. It was started by      
 Olave, Lady Baden Powell. There are 14
 Brownies in our Pack,which meets every
 Tuesday at 5.30p.m. in the Village    
 Hall. Girls can become Brownies at    
 six and a half years old,but they     
 can't be enrolled until they are      
 seven. The leaving age is eleven.     
    Brownies try to help people, and   
 there are also 30 badges which can be 
 worked for. There is a badge called   
 the Venture Badge which we can get if 
 we go on a Pack Venture or a Brownie  
 trip. Some of the other badges are    
 Athlete,Agility,Animal Lover,Artist,  
 Booklover,Craft,Horserider,Hostess,   
 Knitter,Rambler and Sewing.           
    Thinking Day is on 22nd February   
 when we remember our Founder, and     
 Brownies everywhere.
