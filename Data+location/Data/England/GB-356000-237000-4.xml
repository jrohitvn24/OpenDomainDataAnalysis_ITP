		<title>04POLICING IN MORDIFORD</title>
		<content>   In the areas surrounding Mordiford  
 there is one local policeman - P.C.   
 Williams. The local Police Station is 
 run single handedly from Bartestree,  
 two miles away.                       
   West Mercia Police see the main     
 function of village and rural policing
 as providing a law and order presence 
 that villagers can rely upon and      
 trust. However approximately two      
 hundred crimes occur each year in the 
 D-Block, mostly involving criminal    
 damage and burglaries. The age group  
 that causes most problems is that     
 between sixteen and twenty years.     
   A problem particular to this area is
 poaching which occurs mainly in Haugh 
 Woods and along the River Wye, the    
 prime targets being deer and salmon   
 respectively.
