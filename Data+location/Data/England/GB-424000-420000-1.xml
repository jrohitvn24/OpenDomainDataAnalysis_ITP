		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO DEWSBURY</title>
		<content> Bywell, Chickenley and Eastborough    
 schools joined in the survey of the   
 eastern half of the market town of    
 Dewsbury(pop.40,000)and part of       
 Ossett(20,000).Eastborough is a town  
 centre school,Bywell is surrounded    
 mainly by private houses whilst       
 Chickenley is in the middle of a large
 council estate.Dewsbury,situated in   
 the Calder valley,was once the centre 
 of the heavy woollen industry.The     
 textile trade declined however,and    
 many mills have been converted to     
 other uses.The textile industry       
 attracted many workers from India and 
 Pakistan and there is a large         
 immigrant community in Dewsbury.      
 Dewsbury lies close to the M1         
 and M62 motorways.It has a new bus    
 and police station,sports centre and  
 shopping precinct,while 1985 saw the  
 start of its new ring road.           </content>
