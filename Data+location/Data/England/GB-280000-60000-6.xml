		<content>     We went to the Manor House and we 
 saw a stone statue of a Pomeroy lion  
 standing in the forecourt. The lion   
 was over 400 years old.               
                         The Manor     
 House was next to the church  and we  
 went through the cloisters where the  
 monks used to walk.                   
                    During the Second  
 World War the Manor House was used as 
 an Army Headquarters and the roof was 
 covered with camouflage. In the       
 grounds was an old tithe barn with a  
 weather cock on it and the soldiers   
 used it for target practice and       
 riddled it with bullet holes.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
