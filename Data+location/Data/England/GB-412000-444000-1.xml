{west is the open moorland}of{Ilkley   
{Moor}which forms the eastern fringe of
{Rombald's Moor.}This area is a very   
 popular tourist attraction.It is also 
 used as{rough grazing land}for sheep. 
  To the east of the road is an area   
 which forms the southern slopes of the
{Middle Wharfe Valley.}This area is    
{rich pasture farming land.            
  The hamlet of{Burley Woodhead}is a   
 daughter settlement of the larger     
 village of{Burley-in-Wharfedale.}This 
 is a highly desireable area for       
 housing .Most of the{native           
{inhabitants}have now left, leaving a  
 mainly{wealthy  commuter community.   </content>
