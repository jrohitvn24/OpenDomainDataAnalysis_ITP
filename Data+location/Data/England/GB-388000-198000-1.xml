		<content> The area under study is located 3     
 miles from Stroud, 10 miles from      
 Cirencester and 5 miles from Tetbury. 
 The bedrock is Greater Oolite with    
 Forest Marble, being on the dip slope 
 of the Cotswolds.  The only major     
 physical feature is a periglacial dry 
 valley running N-S, just north of     
 Cherington.   The major land use is   
 agriculture with a small portion of   
 M.O.D.land at Aston Down. There are   
 the two nucleated settlements of      
 Cherington and Avening, plus scattered
 farms and associated buildings.       
 Amenities within the area are limited 
 and the car is the major mode of      
 transport.  Many residents were born  
 within the County, local dialect is   
 used in remoter areas and the ancient 
 burial mounds have given rise to a    
 wealth of folklore.
