		<content> Meppershall is long and straggly,     
 built along a ridge top. The recently 
 developed part has moved away from the
 church and Manor House, leaving these 
 set among open fields. The water tower
 is a dominating feature of the        
 landscape.                            
                                       
 Surrounded by fertile ground,         
 agriculture has always been important,
 even today three farms and eleven     
 horticultural nurseries remain.       
                                       
 There is a small factory in the       
 village which also provides work.     
 Nulectrohms Ltd. makes electric       
 componenents and employs thirty-five  
 people.
