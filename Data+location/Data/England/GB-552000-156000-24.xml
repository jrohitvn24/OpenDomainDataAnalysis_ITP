<content>

The Parish Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Kemsing is of  Saxon/Norman origin (circa 1030A.D.) with substantial 14th and 19th century additions, and is constructed of local Sandstone and Flints.  The roof is of red clay tiles.  At the western end of the roof there is a square wooden turret which used to house 3 bells, but this was increased to six during the 1991 Kemsing Festival. This is crowned by an octagonal spire and the whole structure is clad with Canadian cedar shingles, which were re-shingled in 2004. The church organ by Arnold of Orpington dates from 1973.&lt;br />&lt;br />The memorials in the churchyard are varied, some dating from 1665. In the attached burial ground, managed by the Parochial Church Council and the Parish Council, the use of red, black, or dark grey granite or marble, synthetic stones or plastic flowers are forbidden. There are two 19th Century Lych Gates. Fundraising in under way to replace the Church Hall which was built in 1961.   &lt;br />  &lt;br />
