		<title>16Matthew and Clares Houses</title>
		<content>  I am Clare who lives in 'Kemps', the 
 oldest house in Portslade.When we     
 moved in we practically lived in one  
 room, now the kitchen,whilst Dad      
 worked on the front room,pulling the  
 ceiling down to expose oak beams.The  
 main beam has a notch along it,which  
 means it was pre-plague.The timber was
 probably from shipwrecks.He cleared   
 out the fireplace to find a lovely    
 inglenook.He put in a bathroom in a   
 little room under the stairs as we    
 only had an outside toilet and a sink.
 Dad has started on the bedrooms.A     
 staircase goes up and round into a    
 huge attic where my parents will have 
 their room.                           
  I am Matthew who lives in a modern,  
 four bedroomed,centrally heated house.
 It has a dining room and sitting room 
 with a modern fire.Ours was the last  
 house built and the garden was a dump.</content>
