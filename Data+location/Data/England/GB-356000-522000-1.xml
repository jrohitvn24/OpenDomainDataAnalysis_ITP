  The area in the block is a rural one 
 with a cultivated grassland/forestry  
 landscape and includes two            
 villages:Morland and Cliburn and a    
 very small part of Great Strickland.  
 There are no steep hills or large     
 areas of flat land as the relief is   
 one of shallow river valleys and      
 ridges between.                       
     Because of the number of          
 plantations and small woods and the   
 very large number of major trees      
 standing in the hedgerows, it appears 
 that the area is more heavily wooded  
 than it actually is.                  
     Apart from the houses in the      
 villages the area is scattered with   
 isolated farms with the differing     
 range of farm buildings such as       
 barn,milk sheds,machinery store,grain 
 or slurry store towers and farm house.</content>
