		<content>Percy Hacklin took us on a walk around 
the village to show us where all the   
different tradesmen used to be. Over   
the top of Central Stores there are    
lots of little windows where a weaver  
worked. Where the bus stop is was a    
blacksmith. 4, Bell Hill used to be a  
bakers. You can still see the bulge    
that was the drying oven. The baker was
called Father Christmas and he used to 
go round in a horse and cart selling   
his bread and cakes. Down by the bakery
is an old spring where people came down
and got their water using a yoke. Rope 
Way was so called because they used to 
make rope there from one end of the    
road to the other by walking backwards 
and plaiting it all the way. Where Mr. 
Stubbibgton's shop is used to be a     
boot and shoe mender. The thatcher's   
house used to be a carriers that went  
to Banbury twice a day.                </content>
