		<title>07BUS SERVICES APPLETON WISKE</title>
		<content> Appleton Wiske has a United service   
 bus to Northallerton on a Wednesday   
 and Northallerton and Stockton on     
 Saturdays.Return fare is Â£2.00 and was
 thought expensive.Not many people use 
 the service bus,only 4 out of 55 used 
 it once a week,3 out of 55 used it    
 twice a week.Almost half the people   
 surveyed thought the service bus      
 should run more often,3 or 4 times a  
 week and some thought daily.The       
 village has a Mini_Bus which is run by
 a committee.The present Mini_Bus is a 
 15 seat Ford Transit,Use of the       
 Mini_Bus is open to all villagers but 
 only approved persons can drive it.The
 Mini_Bus is used for shopping and     
 pleasure trips and the Scouts take it 
 to camp.Charges are reasonable,the    
 return fare to Northallerton is about 
 50p.The charge varies with the number 
 of people using it.Jeremy Peacock.    </content>
