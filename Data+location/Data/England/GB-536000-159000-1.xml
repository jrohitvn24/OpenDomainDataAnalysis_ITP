Farleigh is in the N.E. corner of the  
county of Surrey. The council wanted   
Farleigh to join the G.L.C.in 1955.the 
people fought this and in 1969 Farleigh
came under the authority of a rural    
church council.There is a village      
green, a tiny church dating back to    
Domesday  times surrounded by          
farmland.There is a ditch around the   
green which stopped cars from spoiling 
the grass as they stopped for picnics  
or walks.The sign posts in Farleigh    
are excellent so you can't get         
lost.There are also footpath maps.You  
have to be very   careful that you     
dont go over the farmers fields as you 
may damage their  crops.There are now  
only two working farms in Farleigh who 
must pay their  rent to Merton College.
