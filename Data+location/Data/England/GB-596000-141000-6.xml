		<title>06Farming in Great Chart.</title>
		<content> In the Great Chart 'D' Block fifty per
 cent of the land is used for farming. 
 The size of farm varies from 300 to   
 700 acres.Most of them are farmed     
 extensively,that is,with few men and  
 many machines.The farms are a mixture 
 of arable and animal.The crops include
 wheat,barley,rape,oats,potatoes and   
 peas,most of which are grown for cash 
 crops.Both dairy and beef cattle are  
 reared.Sheep farming in Great Chart is
 small.The soil types in the area are  
 very variable and the area around the 
 Great Stour is liable to flooding.The 
 farms in the area are affected by the 
 spread of urban development and the   
 new by-pass and some damage is done by
 walkers trespassing on the land.
