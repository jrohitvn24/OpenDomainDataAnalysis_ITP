		<content> Natural elements in the area used for 
 various industrial purposes.          
 The Forest area is mostly deciduous,  
 and the abundance of trees provided   
 fuel for the furnaces of the Iron     
 Masters in Country The Hammer Ponds   
 were so named because water flowing   
 from them was diveretd to work the    
 machinery for the Hammers used for    
 breaking up of Iron stone dug from    
 local pits. The iron was used to      
 produce guns,firebacks and tomb       
 stones, the railings first made for St
 Pauls were cast in Sussex and the     
 horse shoes used by the Cavalry were  
 made in local area of Roffey.         
 Grassland and farmland coverd quite   
 big areas and agricultural produce was
 most probably more abundant than  that
 of the industrial projects. Now many  
 Garden Centres continue this trend..
