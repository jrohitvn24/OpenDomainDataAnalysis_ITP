		<title>20The Future,Marchwood</title>
		<content>{Marchwood is growing rapidly.}Many new
 housing estates are already planned.A 
 new shopping precinct is being built  
 in the centre of the village, and a   
 new village hall and sports centre are
 planned as well.Old peoples' bungalows
 are to be built close to the new      
 Community school.Ironically the       
 village's oldest building, Malthouse  
 Farm,over 250 years old, is being     
 converted into a doctor's surgery.    
      The area is obviously in for many
 changes in the future.                
          .................            
    This study on the Marchwood area   
 was completed by members of classes   
 12C and 12D, of Abbotswood Middle     
 School,Totton, Hampshire in July 1985.
     We would like to thank the        
 numerous people in the Marchwood      
 area who helped us.
