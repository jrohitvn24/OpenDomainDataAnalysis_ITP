		<title>12A MODERN VIEW</title>
		<content>  The opened blinds reveal a wide view 
 full of grass, hedges and trees, and  
 on the near horizon houses stand      
 underneath a pale blue sky. Glancing  
 sideways to broaden my view the ugly  
 sight of mounds of earth dominate and 
 stand out. The huge earth eating      
 machine quickly works its way through 
 the soil, not caring what else it     
 destroys in its path.                 
  A park is seen looking lonely, bare  
 and desolate. The birds gliding on the
 breeze swiftly and proudly make their 
 entrance into my view. My eyes see no 
 poeple, no vehicles. The view seems so
 peaceful without them. But then an old
 woman slowly and painfully walks into 
 view and the excavator begins again to
 chew the earth.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
