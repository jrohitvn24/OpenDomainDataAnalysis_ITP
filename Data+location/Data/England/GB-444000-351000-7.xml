		<content>  {CHAINLINK}- any number of people can
 play. One person is chosen to be 'on'.
 This person has to run after the      
 others and try to touch them. If a    
 person is touched he/she has to join  
 hands with the toucher and try to     
 catch others. As the game progresses  
 the chain gets longer and longer. The 
 game ends when all the people have    
 been touched.                         
  {PEG-LEG}- this is a hopping game.   
 Any number of people can play. Again  
 one person is chosen to be 'on'. This 
 person stands in the centre of the    
 yard on one leg. The other players    
 have to hop across the yard and avoid 
 being touched by the person who is    
 'on'. If they are touched then they   
 must help the person in the centre.   
 The game ends when all the players    
 have been touched.
