		<content> My  semi detached house,built in 1933,
 is due for modernisation soon,which   
 will include central heating.My family
 have lived there for 15 years.The     
 accommodation consists of 3 bedrooms, 
 kitchen,bathroom,toilet,lounge and    
 dining room.There is no garage but we 
 have front and back gardens.My semi-  
 detached house was built in 1971 by   
 Fairview Homes.It was bought brand new
 in 1972, and has 3 bedrooms,bathroom, 
 toilet,kitchen,dining room and lounge.
 The 1981 extension included a garage, 
 study and second toilet.We have oil   
 central heating.There are 10 or 12    
 similar houses nearby.New houses are  
 being built in the village,mainly by  
 Wimpeys.The flat roofed Crittall built
 houses are still occupied providing an
 interesting architectural appearance  
 which is maintained by the local      
 Council's strict conservation rules.  </content>
