		<title>04All Saints Church, Denmead.</title>
		<content>  One of the centres of village life is
 All Saints Church. This was built in  
 1880 in the Early English style when  
 the Parish boundaries were being      
 redefined. It is built from local     
 flint and stone from Bath.            
  The design of the Church is very     
 simple having only a Nave, Sanctuary  
 and Vestries (added in 1959). However 
 there are some interesting features.  
  Near the door is the Font. This was  
 given to All Saints by its parent     
 Church, St. Peter and St. Paul,       
 Hambledon, in 1880. It is of 13th or  
 14th century origin. Another feature  
 we would not expect to find in a      
 Victorian Church is a Rood Screen.    
  Windows in the Church are nearly all 
 Memorial windows. They remember former
 Vicars, Schoolmasters, those who gave 
 ground for the Church and those who   
 fell in two World Wars.               </content>
