		<content> and lavender bags.  All the things    
 should be hand made.  There is a      
 ducking pond in the Market Place.  In 
 the olden days the ducking pond was   
 used for punishing women who nagged   
 and scolded their husbands.  But today
 we duck people for fun.  For example  
 people who do not wear fair costume   
 when they are serving on a stall, get 
 ducked.  There are also stocks built  
 of wood.  The organisers of the Fair  
 put people in the stocks.  The people 
 standing around throw wet sponges at  
 them.                                 
 In the middle of the Market Place a   
 wooden stage is erected so that       
 children and adults can entertain the 
 crowds.  A band comes from Norway and 
 plays brass instruments on the stage. 
 Many people come for a holiday to     
 Alnwick during the fair and they      
 enjoy watching the dancing.           </content>
