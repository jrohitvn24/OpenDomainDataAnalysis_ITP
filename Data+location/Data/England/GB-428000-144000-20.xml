		<title>20VIEWS ON VILLAGE LIFE TODAY.</title>
		<content>  Parents &amp; children of Amport School  
 who conducted the survey found that   
 many think that villages are no longer
 close communities. Farm labourers, in 
 thatched cottages, rarely leaving the 
 village,are no more.Their descendants,
 in council houses, work in Andover.   
 Until they are 11, their children go  
 to the Village School. Then they move 
 to an Andover Comprehensive, make new 
 friends &amp; drift away. Church, School &amp;
 Pub keep alive the village community  
 according to the Amport Post Mistress.
 Mr McConnell, author, added the shop. 
 The shopkeeper insisted that local    
 supermarkets had killed village shops 
 which could only offer a service.This 
 included selling video-cassettes. Many
 loved village life. Mr McConnell said 
 that, without newspapers or radio, one
 could look around the village and say,
 "All's well with the world."          </content>
