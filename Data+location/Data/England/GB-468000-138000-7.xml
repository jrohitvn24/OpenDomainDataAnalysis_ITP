		<content>    During lunchtime we played cricket 
 on the grass and tennis ball          
 football.At 1.00pm we had to do       
 Divinity,until 1.30pm.Then we read    
 until 2.10pm.Then we had play time.It 
 started to rain through it and we had 
 to come in.At 2.30pm we read until    
 home_time(3.30).                      
    I went home and got changed and    
 went to play football.At 6.00pm I had 
 my dinner.I went upstairs,turned on   
 the T.V. and watched it.I got fed     
 up,turned the T.V. off and went into  
 my room and turned the radio on.Then  
 at 9.30pm my mum shouted up the stairs
 "Go to sleep now,"and so I got into my
 pyjamas and went to sleep.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
