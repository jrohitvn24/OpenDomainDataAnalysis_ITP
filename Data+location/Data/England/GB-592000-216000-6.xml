		<content> The farm belongs to Mr. &amp; Mrs. C. G.  
 Coe and Mr. &amp; Mrs. K.Coe. The house   
 was built in the 16th century. The    
 farm was bought from the Round Estate 
 in 1955 - it was rented before this by
 their parents - and the brothers were 
 born there.  They get up at 5.45, feed
 the animals then they milk the cows at
 6.00 am.  At 7.30 am they have their  
 breakfast. They work until dark but if
 the weather's bad they have to stop.  
 There is no other help.  They have 100
 acres of pasture. It is a dairy and   
 sheep farm. They have 45 cows, 15     
 bullocks, 320 sheep,13 rams,500 lambs,
 2 ponies and 2 horses,5 dogs,3 cats.  
 They go to the Colchester market for  
 sheep and Chelmsford for cattle. They 
 buy and sell their animals. They have 
 4 tractors, 2 hay turners, 1 grass    
 cutter, 1 baler, 1 lorry and 1 forage 
 harvester.There are remains of a moat.</content>
