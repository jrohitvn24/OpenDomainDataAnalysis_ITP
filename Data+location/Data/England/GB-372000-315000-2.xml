		<content> We found the average size{family}is 2 
 or 3 children; there are almost no    
 families with 5 or more children. The 
 numbers in our{Primary school}for the 
 last 10 years show a rise from 1968 to
 1976 and since then a gradual fall    
 until this year when it is levelling  
 off again. This is due to an increase 
 in the number of young children coming
 into school.{Playgroup}numbers also   
 have increased since May 1983. The    
 number of{pensioners}who collect      
 pensions at Lilleshall Post Office is 
 90 and some collect from Newport. The 
 reason is probably because there is an
 old peoples' home in the village. At  
 Lilleshall church in 1985 there have  
 been 17{christenings}so far. The least
 amount of christenings at the church  
 was in 1981 when there were only 13.
