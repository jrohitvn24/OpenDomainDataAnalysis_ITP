		<title>03Whipsnade Parish Council.</title>
		<content> The Whipsnade Parish Council consists 
 of seven elected members.The Council  
 meets every two months and its chief  
 duties are to  review all building    
 applications before they go forward to
 the Planning Committee of the South   
 Bedfordshire District Council.The     
 Council also does its best to see that
 all bridleway and footpaths are kept  
 open,also that roads through the      
 Parish are kept as safe as            
 possible.The precept is kept as low as
 possible,but the Parish Council is    
 able at times to help the funds of the
 Village Hall and the Churchyard Fund  
 of the parish church.Any parishioner  
 can attend any meeting and once a year
 there is an open meeting when anyone  
 can put forward any questions to the  
 Council.There is also a Parish Council
 in Kensworth run on similar lines.
