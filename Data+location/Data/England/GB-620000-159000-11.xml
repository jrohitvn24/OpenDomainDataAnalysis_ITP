		<content>{    Rogation Sunday}is still          
 celebrated in a little village called 
 Stodmarsh.                            
     On{Rogation Sunday}we ask God to  
 bless all his crops such as corn,     
 fruit and rape. As well as all the    
 crops we ask God to bless the water. A
 collection of people go round the     
 fields with the Rector blessing the   
 crops with people saying little       
 sentences praying for the crops.      
{Rogation}days are the three days      
 leading up to{Ascension Day.}The three
 days are Monday, Tuesday and          
 Wednesday.

     In the Autumn we bring produce in 
 from the fields and gardens and we put
 it into the church. We have a         
 special service called a{Harvest      
{Festival.
