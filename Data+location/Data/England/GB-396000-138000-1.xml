		<title>01The Landscape of Codford</title>
		<content>   Ours is a nice area in which to     
 live. There are rolling Downs with the
 River Wylye running through the       
 valley. The Chitterne Brook flows     
 through the school grounds and enters 
 the River wylye in Codford. There is a
 main road called the A.36. which      
 splits Codford and spoils it a bit as 
 continuous traffic runs through the   
 village but we hope to have a bye_pass
 built soon. There are a variety of    
 houses in the area, some very old and 
 some modern. Codford is the largest   
 village with Stockton and Sherrington 
 the next biggest villages being much  
 smaller. Our area is mainly fields and
 open grazing land with the ancient    
 earthwork of Codford Circle           
 overlooking the village of Codford.
