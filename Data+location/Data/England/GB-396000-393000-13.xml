		<title>13MOTTRAM - Housing contd.</title>
		<content>    The earlier structures were simple,
but roomy, terraced houses abutting on 
to the street, but as wealth increased 
in the late 19th Century, semi-detached
and detached houses, with bay windows  
and gardens began to appear at the edge
of Mottram and adjacent settlements.   
     In the 20th Century larger pockets
of houses were created on land adjacent
to Mottram Old Hall and on either side 
of Stalybridge Road.  These are locally
known as the Old Hall estate, Roe Cross
Green and Lane Ends estate.            
     Shortage of building land and     
Green belt status of the open spaces   
now only allows for ilnfill of houses  
or conversion of present farm          
structures.
