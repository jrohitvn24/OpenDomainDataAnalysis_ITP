		<title>12INDUSTRIAL ESTATE 2</title>
		<content> oil coolers and compressors. They buy-
 in the raw material, mainly steel, and
 then mke custom made equipment. They  
 are suppliers to the Ministry of      
 Defence, Ford, Renault, Vauxhall, and 
 export to Switzerland and China. They 
 have also supplied motor pumps to     
 brewers, like Whitbread and Guinness. 
   Amongst the other firms on the      
 estate are, a maker of snooker tables,
 employing between 3 and 6 workers. A  
 TV repair workshop with 3 staff, and a
 carpentary-joinery concern, who       
 specialise in supplying wood to local 
 building firms and employ 6 people.   
   Most of the firms were started by   
 one or two people, and frequently     
 without a government grant of any     
 kind. Some like 'Occo' are well-      
 established, while others are clearly 
 of a more marginal type. Heath Hill   
 will clearly remain a small estate.   </content>
