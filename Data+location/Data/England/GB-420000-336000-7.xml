		<title>07LONGFORD MILL</title>
		<content>    In Longford there is an old water  
 mill. It is beside Brailsford         
 Brook. The mill is not used any more  
 but sometimes the wheel turns. The    
 water-wheel is an undershot wheel.    
 The mill used to grind flour and      
 chicory.                              
    The mill pond is part of Brailsford
 Brook.                                
    There is a small white door at the 
 top of the building. A grown-up would 
 have to bend over to go through it.   
 There is a rope-pully that used to    
 pull sacks up.                        
    The mill was rebuilt in 1837. The  
 mill was used as a corn store after it
 stopped grinding corn.                
    The mill has a very big garden. Now
 it is a private house.
