		<content>   We devised a questionaire to try to 
find out what people do in their spare 
time. We printed 75 sheets and stood   
on the Market Hill for about 1 hour.   
Sixty people answered our questions:   
    30 were interested in sport        
    10 were involved in sports clubs   
    21 used Sudbury's sports facilities
       (8 of these lived out of town)  
    18 were in other clubs etc.        
    The activities mentioned were:     
golf,swimming,football,rugby,hockey,   
snooker,tennis,badminton,keep fit,     
squash,bridge,riding,netball,archery,  
basketball,table tennis,bowls,guides,  
WI,Age Concern,Scouts,Majorettes,Quay  
Theatre,CND,St.Johns,Rotary,Church and 
Charity Clubs. Though this is a long   
list from 60 people, there are many    
more activities listed in the town's   
library.      By: Ann Bailey, Helen
