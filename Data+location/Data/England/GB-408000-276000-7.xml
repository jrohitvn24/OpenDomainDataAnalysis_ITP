		<content> There has been much change in the     
 Shirley area in the past 50           
 years,because it is on the urban      
 fringe of the Birmingham area.28% of  
 the housing is less than 10 years     
 old;14% between 10 and 25 years; 28%  
 between 25 and 40 years; and 30% over 
 40 years.The area is affluent, with   
 over a quarter of the housing         
 detached and nearly two thirds        
 semi-detached.Almost all housing was  
 built in the present century,with 8   
 out of 10 being owner-occupied.The    
 prosperity of the area is illustrated 
 by the fact that over 75% of the      
 households have central               
 heating,TV,automatic                  
 washer,freezer,at least 1 car, and    
 over 50% have computers,video         
 recorders and telephones.Several even 
 have their own swimming pools!
