		<title>09Norman  Church in Hauxwell</title>
		<content>   The {ancient church of St.Oswald }is
 situated in the  grounds  of the manor
 house.  In the churchyard  is  a{Saxon
{cross,}reputed to be one of the oldest
 in this country.  It is  engraved with
 an interlaced design. Visitors can see
 crusaders' gravestones  and  a devil's
 door.   Herring-bone masonry  patterns
 the church walls.  The  nave  door and
 chancel arch are Norman.  Inside there
 are two 14th. century effigies made of
 gesso work, an  Elizabethan brass  and
 some very interesting memorials.      
   Locals still talk  about  Hauxwell's
 connection with{"Sister Dora."}Born in
 the rectory in 1825  she  later became
 famous as a nurse in Walsall. Her home
 no longer exists.  The present Rectory
 is  combined  with  Spennithorne   and
 Fingall. Local worshippers are few but
 services occur regularly.   The church
 door is always open to visitors.      </content>
