 and Jockey' which is a game which is  
 played in the following way. First of 
 all you have a partner and one person 
 sits out and they have to blow a      
 whistle. If it blown twice you have to
 run and jump on your partner's back,  
 and whoever is slowest is out. If the 
 whistle is bl0wn once you keep on     
 going around the room and it can made 
 you very hot.

 'Oxford and Cambridge', again you have
 a partner and you sit on the floor,and
 you have a number you have to run down
 the middle and up the side,and the    
 first to complete the run and sit down
 gets points for the team.Another game 
 is called 'key's, in this game you    
 have to tie a scarf around a partner  
 eyes,and they have the keys in front  
 of them.There is a circle of people   </content>
