 Mr. Lowndes has two lorries. He gets  
 up at about 4.30a.m. By 5.30a.m., he  
 is on the weighbridge in the quarry.  
                                       
 Then he goes into the quarry where    
 most mornings he is loaded with tarmac
 and then returns to the weighbridge.  
 He then gets a ticket which tells him 
 where to go. He puts the sheet on and 
 begins his journey.                   
                                       
 He often does 250-300 miles a day and 
 at about 4.30p.m. he is back at home. 
 He then does odd jobs and fills the   
 lorry with diesel.                    
                                       
 The places that he goes to most often 
 are Birmingham, Manchester, Oldham and
 Coventry.
