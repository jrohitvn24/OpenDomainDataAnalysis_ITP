		<content> CONTENTS OF ISSUE 19 - JUNE 1985      
                                       
 The Front Page article offers         
 information about the Withernsea Rifle
 Club. Withernsea is the nearest       
 coastal resort to Burton Pidsea.      
 Page Two is taken up entirely with the
 article on Local History - a new,     
 regular feature. The title of this    
 particular feature is "Our Shrinking  
 Shores" and it is concerned with the  
 villages of Holderness lost to coastal
 erosion.                              
 Regular features spread through the   
 paper include a crossword puzzle,     
 Letter's Column, Diary of Events and  
 Information, a "Birdwatch" Column and 
 a story of "Old Murder". This tells of
 a vicar of Owthorne who was murdered  
 in 1708 by a man he had taken in as an
 orphan; killed because he refused to  
 allow his daughter to marry the man.  </content>
