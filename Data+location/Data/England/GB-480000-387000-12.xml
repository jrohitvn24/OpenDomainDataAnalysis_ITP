		<content> We conducted a survey of the houses   
 that lie within the catchment area of 
 Whites Wood Lane School.We were not   
 able to find out about each house,so  
 we collected a large sample from      
 children at the school.We asked them  
 about the number of rooms,number of   
 people,type of house and whether they 
 had a garage.The average size of a    
 family was four people,although       
 several families contained five or    
 six.Over 70% of families had four,five
 or six people.We were surprised to    
 find that 10% of the families had five
 children.Well over half of the houses 
 had garages,and 15% were              
 bungalows.Almost exactly half of the  
 houses had seven rooms,which includes 
 a bathroom/toilet.40% had six rooms.  
 20%,the largest group,contained four  
 people,had seven rooms and a garage.
