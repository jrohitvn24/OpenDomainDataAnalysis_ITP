		<content> It is only the extreme West of the    
 area which has high density population
 the Shotgate part of Wickford.Battles-
 -bridge and Rawreth villages are the  
 only other population centres.Other   
 housing is mainly scattered and       
 detached,though there are a few       
 isolated terraces.Shotgate is a recent
 development containing a variety of   
 houses from 2 to 4 bedrooms.All have  
 to conform to the Essex Guild of house
 design and are for purchase not rent. 
 Prices are from Â£30,000 upward.Rawreth
 and Battlesbridge have a variety of   
 house styles from cottages to large   
 detached houses in their own grounds. 
 Both have a row of council houses.Most
 houses are farm houses and some e.g.  
 Rawreth Hall must be classified as    
 mansions.There are traces of the      
 plotland development from the start of
 the century;several now modernised.   </content>
