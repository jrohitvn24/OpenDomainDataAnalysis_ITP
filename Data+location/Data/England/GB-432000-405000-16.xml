		<content> As part of our sub-topic we made      
 a visit to Barnsley main post office. 
 It is situated in the centre of town  
 on Pitt Street. The sorting office was
 very interesting: There exists only   
 two machines to help sort the mail;   
 the conveyor which takes the sacks    
 from the yard to the office, and the  
 cancelling machine which cancels or   
 'franks'the stamps. The rest of the   
 work is done by hand. Each postman has
 a duty to perform at the office as    
 well as delivering the mail. There are
 some boxes there where people pay to  
 collect their own letters which we    
 thought was rather strange. Mr Roy    
 Mason M.P has a special box for his   
 mail which then has to be sent to     
 Sheffield to be checked for           
 explosives. Mr Young, who showed us   
 round expected all the mail to be sent
 to Sheffield soon: (cont'd on page 17)</content>
