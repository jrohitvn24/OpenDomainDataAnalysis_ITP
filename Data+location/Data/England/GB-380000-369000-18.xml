		<content> on a{casual basis}during the busy     
 periods. Halmans Nurseries is a family
 run general nursery run with the help 
 of casual labour in the season.       
  The Red Lion{public house}has        
 recently had a new manager and employs
 several people. The{Village Hall      
 employs 1 person.                     
  Most people who live in the Lower    
 Withington area{travel away}from the  
 village to work some to such places as
 Wilmslow, Macclesfield, Congleton,    
 Sandbach, Northwich or Knutsford      
 whilst others go{further afield}to    
 Manchester, Liverpool or the          
 Potteries. The close proximity of the 
 motorway network, stations on the main
 London to Manchester railway and      
 Manchester International Airport means
 that those who need to travel in the  
 course of their work find this area a 
 convenient place in which to live.    </content>
