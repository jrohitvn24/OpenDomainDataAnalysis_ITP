		<title>18Crosland Moor Airfield</title>
		<content> The Airfield at Crosland Moor was     
 built in 1946 as a private airfield   
 for local tractor manufacturer David  
 Brown.                                
  The airfield is now used by private  
 planes belonging to businessmen and by
 people who want to learn how to fly   
 for fun. Up to twelve planes use the  
 airfield each day along with eight    
 other planes that visit it. The planes
 are four seater light aircraft.       
  The busiest day of the week is Sunday
 because people come for their flying  
 lessons. It costs Â£50 an hour to learn
 to fly and takes about 43 hours to    
 gain a pilot's licence.               
  There have been two crashes at the   
 airfield but no_one has been seriously
 injured.
