		<content>The area studied stretches from central
Wolverhampton to the suburban housing  
areas of Newbridge,Compton and         
Finchfield on the western edges of the 
town.                                  
Wolverhampton's centre consists mainly 
of shops and offices surrounded by a   
Ring Road which allows through traffic 
to be diverted away from the congested 
town and allowing pedestrianisation in 
the Mander Centre.Immediately beyond   
the Ring Road is a zone of industry and
poor Victorian terraced housing,much   
altered or demolished,but including the
attractive West Park with lake and     
recreation areas.Outside this zone is  
an area of late Victorian quality      
houses many changed to flats or small  
offices.The outer area is mostly       
residential and contains middle quality
inter-war houses eg.Oxbarn and high    
quality properties eg.Compton.         </content>
