		<content> Stalybridge Wakes , on the Market     
 ground, was smashing. Everyone had    
 finished work for their annual        
 holidays. I have memories of black    
 peas, boxing, boat rides and net      
 boats. There were stalls selling pots 
 (crockery and pottery), and umbrellas.
 When it started on Thursday some of   
 the rides were free. The Wakes lasted 
 until the Monday. Happy Times.' The   
 Wakes celebrations, with fair and     
 carnival, still occur today.
