		<title>18A day at School.</title>
		<content>  The school day follows a regular     
pattern. We start with Assembly, which 
one day a week we prepare ourselves.   
The recorder players play for the      
hymns. At 0930 lessons start which     
take us to breaktime at 1040. A        
quarter of an hour to play and then    
another hour of lessons before washing 
in time for lunch. School dinners are  
cooked in the school's kitchen. After  
lunch we can play chess or use the     
computer; outside if it has been       
raining we are restricted to the       
playground, but for most of the summer 
and autumn terms we  can use the       
school field. We can play ball games.  
We return to the classrooms at 1330.   
The afternoons are more fun as part of 
each are spent in such lessons as Art  
&amp; Craft, Music, Dancing, Swimming - we 
go to Marlow in a coach, Games, P.E.   
and Cookery. At last 1540 and hometime!</content>
