		<title>12Closing Of Wickham School</title>
		<content> Wickham St.Paul's school was built in 
 1852 for sixty pupils.At the turn  of 
 the century there were over a hundred 
 children.When Miss Warren,who we      
 interviewed,attended fifty years ago  
 there were fifty children but when the
 school closed in December 1983 there  
 were only eight. There used to be more
 houses because each cottage was       
 smaller and had more children.        
 Nowadays housing is expensive, and    
 many people educate their children at 
 private schools.The school building   
 was the same as it is now. There are  
 two classrooms - one big room and one 
 at the back for the infants. The      
 closure of the school could mean young
 married couples won't move into the   
 village.The elderly miss watching the 
 children playing on the green, and    
 feel sad that the school is no longer 
 part of the village.                  </content>
