		<content>There  are a  few  outlying  farms  and
cottages but the bulk of the population
lives in one of the three villages.    
{Warmington} has some 300 houses.   The
current electoral roll lists 607 people
over the age of 18.     It is estimated
that the total population is about 800,
a figure that has remained quite steady
over a number of years.       Enquiries
indicate that there are four  residents
with ages of over 90 years.            
{Fotheringhay} is a much  smaller place
with about 200 residents.              
Only a small part of {Tansor} is in the
block  covered  by  this  part  of  the
survey.    This is also  quite a  small
village.
