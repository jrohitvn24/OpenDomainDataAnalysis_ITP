        We saw some lads from my street
 and they came over to talk to us. They
 didn't have anything to eat or drink  
 so we gave them some of ours. When we 
 had finished eating  we decided to    
 have a game of{rounders}but the boys  
 wanted a game of{football.            
     The youngest boy, Jason, hit the  
 ball too hard and it went in the{lake.
 I was messing about and I said I would
 go in for it, so John, the eldest,    
 pushed me in. They all just looked at 
 me and laughed. I got back out and    
 told them I wasn't going for it; I was
 only joking. They told me to go and   
 get it, now I was already wet, or else
 they would push me in again. So I went
 into the{lake}and got the ball.       
     When I got home my friends came   
 for me, but I took some Coldrex and   
 went to bed.                          </content>
