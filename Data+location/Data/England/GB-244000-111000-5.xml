		<title>05THATTON FARM.</title>
		<content> This is a 147 acre farm which supports
 a family of two. Grass is the main    
 enterprise. 40 acres of winter sown   
 barley is also grown. The present     
 owner has kept no stock on the farm   
 for the last thirty years. Only       
 artificial fertilisers are used. There
 are about five acres of deciduous     
 woodland, consisting mainly of oak,   
 ash and birch.  There has been no full
 time labour for thirty years, apart   
 from seasonal labour at harvest time. 
 There is a public footpath through the
 farm.
