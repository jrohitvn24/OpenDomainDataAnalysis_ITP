		<title>16DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> It is Monday morning. I woke up with  
 the sun shining in the window. It     
 looked as if it was going to be a hot 
 and sticky day. I went down stairs. A 
 smell of burnt toast was in the room. 
 I got a bowl of cornflakes and began  
 to eat them. I Read the news paper.   
 The head lines said "rock concert went
 of with a bang". I finished eating and
 had a wash. After that i got dressed  
 and went to feed my rabbit. I got my  
 school bag ready and left for school. 
 We walked up the road and passed all  
 the traffic which was lined up along  
 our road. We crossed on the zebra     
 crossing and went past the cinema. The
 school bell goes at 9 o clock. We went
 in and hung our coat's up. This       
 morning we did maths. Then we went    
 into assembly. We sat right up the    
 back.Gary started to do his meditating
 and every one kept laughing.          </content>
