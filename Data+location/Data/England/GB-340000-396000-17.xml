		<title>17Our School:Park Brow Kirkby</title>
		<content> Our school is called Park Brow Juniors
 in Kirkby. Most of the time I like our
 school. Most days we do Maths and     
 English work in the morning. Sometimes
 we watch television programmes and do 
 some work about them. After having our
 dinner we might do some work on       
 History and Geography or we might     
 paint or go out for a game in P.E.    
 I like school because we do different 
 things all the time and although      
 sometimes I get fed up with working,  
 usually it's not too bad. Our school  
 has a football team that plays after  
 school. I would like to get into the  
 team next year.
