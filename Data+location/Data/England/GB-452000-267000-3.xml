		<content>The entry for Barby in the original    
Domesday book indicates that the land  
was used primarily for agriculture.    
Nothing has changed.  The soil is best 
for grass production and consequently  
two thirds is used for pasture.  The   
remaining third is used for growing    
barley, wheat, oats and oil seed rape. 
Grass is also grown as a crop.  Because
of recent changes in EEC milk          
production quotas, many farmers have   
changed from milk to beef production.  
                                       
A ruined windmill stands at the        
Southern end of Barby and the site has 
undergone an interesting change of use,
for it is being converted into a trout 
farm - no doubt taking advantage of    
several natural springs.  Beyond the   
trout farm on the Daventry Road a      
thriving Nursery Garden has been       
established to supply a Rugby Nursery. </content>
