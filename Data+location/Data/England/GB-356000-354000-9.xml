 Haughton is a farming community with  
 many people commuting to neighbouring 
 towns and villages. A school cook     
 travels five miles to Bickley and her 
 husband is a salesman travelling all  
 over the country. A solicitor and a   
 county council worker have a daily    
 journey of 17 miles to Chester. Some  
 people find work in Crewe - a main    
 railway link - among them a British   
 Rail controller and a pharmacist, who 
 is the wife of a local farmer.        
 Nantwich is another country town 7    
 miles away to which people commute; an
 agricultural engineer and a dress shop
 manageress whose husband is a director
 of a national charity, also a vet has 
 a surgery in Nantwich. Another young  
 man works with computers in Liverpool 
 and we have a tanner working in       
 Birkenhead.                           </content>
