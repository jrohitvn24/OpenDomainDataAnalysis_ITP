		<title>03TRADE_SHOPPING IN HEADINGLEY</title>
		<content>    ON THE 8TH MAY 1985 MY CLASS MADE A
 SURVEY OF THE SHOPS AT HEADINGLEY     
 ARNDALE CENTRE.THERE WERE 26 SHOPS,OF 
 WHICH 6 WERE FOODSHOPS,4 WERE         
 CLOTHES-SHOPS,2 WERE STATIONERS AND 2 
 SOLD ELECTRICAL GOODS.THERE WAS 1 BANK
 AND A POST OFFICE.THE BIGGEST SHOPS   
 WERE SAFEWAYS SUPERMARKET,WOOLWORTHS  
 HOUSE-HOLD GOODS,AND WILKINSONS       
 D.I.Y. FOUR SHOPS WERE VACANT AND THE 
 BOOK SHOP WAS CLOSING DOWN.THIS IS    
 BECAUSE THE SHOP RENTS AND RATES HAVE 
 RISEN BY 10%.BIG SHOPS LIKE SAFEWAYS  
 CAN AFFORD THE HIGH RATES BECAUSE THEY
 HAVE A LOT OF CUSTOMERS EACH DAY,BUT  
 THE SMALLER SHOPS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO
 MANAGE.
