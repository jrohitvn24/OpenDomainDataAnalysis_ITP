		<content> This iron age farmstead of about 16   
 hectares was enclosed by a timber     
 palisade in the 4th century B.C.,     
 which was replaced by a defensive bank
 and ditch in the 2nd century.Inside   
 were 2 large circular huts 48ft and   
 36ft in diameter,made mainly from     
 timber and probably thatched. These   
 were the farmhouses. The many pits and
 small timber buildings were probably  
 used for grain storage. Barley was the
 main crop and the threshing was done  
 on flat areas called{'working hollows'
 and the grain was ground between flat 
 stones. Spinning and weaving were also
 done on the site. The site was        
 excavated in 1938 by Prof.G. Bersu for
 the Prehestoric soc. Nothing can      
 now be seen at ground level. No traces
 of the field system survived,but there
 are good examples of iron age fields  
 in other parts of the Salisbury area. </content>
