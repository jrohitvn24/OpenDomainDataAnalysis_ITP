 people.                               
  Mr Woods did not work in Corringham, 
 he was a workshop super-intendant on  
 the REME estate. He now visits        
 Gainsborough three times a week for   
 shopping and welfare activities.      
  Mr Woods has lived in the same       
 bungalow (which he designed himself)  
 since he came to Corringham.It is     
 quite spaceous and set in a 1/4       
 acre of garden. Mr Woods is a keen    
 gardener.                             </content>
