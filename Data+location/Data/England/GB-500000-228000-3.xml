		<title>03TODDINGTON VILLAGE GREEN</title>
		<content> A{landscape}feature in the centre of  
 Toddington is the Village Green. The  
 water pump (1855) remains. The garage 
 was the old forge. The Memorial is a  
 tribute to the dead of two World Wars.
 Around the Green are many{Georgian    
{houses}e.g. Wentworth House, which    
 reflect the peak of prosperity of the 
 once great market town. The{Town Hall,
 with its Elizabethan walls, still     
 stands, although unused and neglected.
 Next to the Town Hall is a wall of    
 Flemish Bond Brickwork which was once 
 the lower storey of the Cloisters. The
 Oddfellows Arms, Bell and Red Lion are
 old{Inns}still serving refreshment to 
 passers by. The electric station, once
 the animal pound, and a gas house are 
 to be found on the Green. The library 
 is the most modern building on the    
 Green. It stands on the site of an old
 bakery.Fetes are held on the Green.   </content>
