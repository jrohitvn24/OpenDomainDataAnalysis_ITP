		<title>15CASTLEFORD'S TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Castleford provides a local bus       
 service. Most buses go westwards into 
 urban areas of West Yorkshire.        
 Castleford provides a small local rail
 service to Leeds and Goole.These Metro
 trains look and sound like buses.You  
 pay the conductor during a trip. A    
 major freight distribution centre     
 near-by results in about 50-55 freight
 trains per day passing through        
 Castleford on the main line between   
 Teesside and the Midlands. Canal push 
 tugs carry coal from local collieries 
 to Ferrybridge Power station.Barges   
 bring oil upstream from Immingham. A  
 few pleasure boats use the river,     
 particularly on Sundays. A family     
 survey of private transport showed    
 that 66% have cars,61% have pedal     
 cycles,3% have motorcycles and 12%    
 rely on public transport.
