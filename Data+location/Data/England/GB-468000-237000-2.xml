The area surveyed in N.W. Bucks is     
about 90% farmland and open spaces.    
Akeley lies in the S.E. corner and     
Lillingstone Dayrell covers 3Km square.
Landscape is undulating with winding   
roads - the A413 runs from N. to S.    
linking the villages with Buckingham   
and Northampton.  N.W. lies one of the 
fee-paying schools, Charmandean, in    
park and woodland.  Akeley Wood School 
is south and covering 1Km square is the
grounds of Stowe Public School.  Akeley
is on the third highest peak in Bucks. 
The village centre is compact and      
covers .5Km - a very quiet area,       
there being neither shop, church,      
industry nor entertainment and only one
pub.  Akeley has a village first       
school but for how long?
