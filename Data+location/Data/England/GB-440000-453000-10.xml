		<title>10RIVER NIDD</title>
		<content> The river{NIDD}has its source at{GREAT
{WHERNSIDE}.There  is a weir in        
{HUNSINGORE}near a water mill,but the  
 mill is not in use now.There is a     
 bridge here too.Before the first      
 bridge was built there was a ford.Then
 there was a wooden bridge that fell   
 down and about 5 years ago the  new   
 one was built.There are trout put into
 the river upstream from{HUNSINGORE.   
 There are lots of other fish (mainly  
 coarse fish) like chub,dace,pike and  
 perch,gudgeon,minnows and lots of     
 other kinds. On one side of the river 
 the fishing rights are owned by an    
 angling club called Bradford No.1 and 
 on the other side by Harrogate.In     
 winter there is an island in the river
 but on one side in summer it dries    
 up.The river goes down to Nun Monkton 
 where it joins another river and      
 changes its name from{Nidd}to Ouse.   </content>
