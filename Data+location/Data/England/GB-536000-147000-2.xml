		<title>02LAGHAM MANOR,STH.GODSTONE</title>
		<content>{    Lagham Manor}is the first recorded
 by name in 1169. It was then owned by 
 Eustace of Boulogne. In 1262 the Lord 
 of Lagham obtained a licence from the 
 King to fortify his house with a      
 dyke,towers and a stockade. The moat  
 is the largest in Surrey. Soil was    
 brought to{Lagham}to build the 30'    
 high banks. Traces of homestead moats 
 to keep animals safe from wolves and  
 wild boars are easily seen. There are 
 two drawbridges.                      
    {Lagham}suffered severely from the{
{Black Death.}The Lord and almost all  
 the tenants died. The house fell into 
 decay and the settlement around it    
 disappeared.                          
     The present Jacobean house was    
 built in 1662 on the same site as the 
 original manorhouse and using much of 
 the original stone. Oasthouses, and a 
 brew house have since been added.     </content>
