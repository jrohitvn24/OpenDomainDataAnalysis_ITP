		<title>20Gravel extraction, Pevensey</title>
		<content> The beach to the{East of Pevensey Bay 
 has a part in the Duke of Devonshire's
 plans for an{Eastbourne Marina.}This  
 will provide a safe haven for small   
 craft between Rye and Brighton.       
 The necessary Act of Parliament has   
 now been passed to permit a breach    
 of the sea defences.Work has begun to 
 remove valuable{mineral deposits of   
{gravel}before a golf-range,as part of 
 the Marina complex,is constructed.The 
 large excavation is being filled with 
 inert waste and rubble.Although the   
 gravel is mostly moved by conveyor    
 belt along the beach,much is          
 transported by lorries on the main    
 road.Some motorists have had          
 windscreens broken by flying stones   
 despite the constant sweeping of the  
 road by the contractors.
