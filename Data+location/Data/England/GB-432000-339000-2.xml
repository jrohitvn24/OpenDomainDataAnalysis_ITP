		<content> THIS BLOCK OCCUPIES A WEDGE OF        
 ELEVATED LAND LYING WEST OF THE RIVER 
 DERWENT AND EAST OF MARKEATON BROOK.  
 THE HIGHEST LAND,146 METRES, IS FOUND 
 IN THE NORTHERN PART OF QUARNDON      
 VILLAGE, WHILE THE LOWEST LAND,AROUND 
 50 METRES LIES ALONG THE FLOOD PLAIN  
 OF THE RIVER DERWENT. THE MAJORITY OF 
 THE LAND, LYING ON SHALES, IS FAIRLY  
 HEAVY WITH ABUNDANT SURFACE WATER. THE
 SANDY OUTCROPS CAPPING THE HIGHEST    
 HILLS GIVE A DRY SITE FOR THE VILLAGE 
 OF QUARNDON WHICH HAS GROWN INTO A    
 STELLATED FORM ALONG THE RIDGES OF    
 HIGHER LAND.WHILE THE NORTHERN PART OF
 THE BLOCK IS LARGELY AGRICULTURAL, THE
 SOUTHERN PART IS PREDOMINANTLY        
 URBANIZED.
