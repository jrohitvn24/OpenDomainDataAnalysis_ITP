		<content> When I had done all my dictionary Mrs 
 Symonds said " I want you to write    
 about your day" which I'm doing now.At
 play time I played Fox'n gloves with  
 some of my friends.After play I did   
 some more work about my day.We packed 
 up 11.30 and did some music in the    
 hall for harvest.Then we got our lunch
 boxes.I had ham sandwiches a drink of 
 ribena and a bar of chocolate.After   
 lunch  it was play time.I played dog's
 I was a puppy.After play we did       
 games.We did catching and batting.Then
 Mrs Symonds read us a bit about Stig  
 in the Dump.Then it was home time.In  
 the bus I sat next to Joanna.At home I
 changed and did some gardening with   
 Paul.After gardening it was dinner    
 time. I had sausages and peas.After   
 tea I had a bath.At bedtime I wore a  
 night dress and I went to bed at      
 19.00.                                </content>
