		<content> The Whitbread family have been the    
 major landowners in the Parish since  
 18th Century, with records dating back
 to 1314, referring to their connection
 with the area. A large percentage of  
 the farmland in the square is part of 
 the Samuel Whitbread Estate. This     
 Estate comprises 10,800 acres in all, 
 of which 1,000 acres are woodland,    
 6,500 acres are let land with 1,900   
 acres in hand. There are twelve main  
 let farms plus one partnership and a  
 few additional small holdings.        
 Included in the main tenancies is the 
 Bedfordshire County Council who own   
 approximately 1,000 acres which they  
 let for small holdings. There is also 
 a newly opened "pick your own"farm and
 shop situatedon the A600 Bedford to   
 Hitchin Road. Both fruit and          
 vegetables are available here.
