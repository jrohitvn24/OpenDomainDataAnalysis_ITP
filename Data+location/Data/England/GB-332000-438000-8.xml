		<content> There are two special schools in the  
 area;Wyresdale serves the children    
 with severe educational disabilities  
 of a physical and mental nature. The  
 school has 40 pupils and 8 teaching   
 staff. Fylde Farm is technically a    
 community home and assessment centre. 
 The community home offers a home for  
 the rehabilitation of juveniles under 
 17 years who have committed some      
 offence. The assessment centre is a   
 secure institution where juveniles    
 waiting for a court hearing are       
 assessed on their physical and        
 educational abilities. During the     
 three to four weeks they are there,   
 only basic English and Maths are      
 taught. Adult education throughout the
 Wyre District is in the form of Day   
 and Evening classes. Places are much  
 in demand, which far outstrips supply.
