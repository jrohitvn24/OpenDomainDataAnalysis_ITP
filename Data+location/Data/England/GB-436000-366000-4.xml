		<content>  {The Lido}is a man made pond         
 measuring about      .People pay      
 a year to fish there. They can catch  
{perch, pike, rudd, tench, roach, chub,
{bullhead dace and minnows. }There are 
 also a large number of{frogs}and{toads
 in the lido.  Toads are now quite rare
 so at spawning time there is a road   
 sign on Nethermoor Road warning       
 drivers of 'Toads crossing'. The Lido 
 is also  home for water birds such as 
{swans, coots, grebes, moorhens and    
{mallards.}                            
   The Lido is important to the locals,
 not only is it a habitat for wildlife,
 but it is surrounded by woods,        
 grassland and a play area for children
 containing swings and slides. It is a 
 popular area for people to walk their 
 dogs and in the autumn the locals pick
{blackberries}and gather{conkers. }
