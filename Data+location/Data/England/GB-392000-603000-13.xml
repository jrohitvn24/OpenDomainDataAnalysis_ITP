 In the 1920's the Forestry Commission 
 was set up to produce timber after a  
 big loss during the First World       
 War.Planting in the Kidland Forest    
 commenced a lot later, probably in the
 1940's.At one time there were about   
 twelve employed by them in this forest
 and their base was beside Woodhall.The
 industry inthis area has been run down
 over the last few years. There is     
 no-one local employed in the forests  
 now. Any work is carried out by men   
 from Rothbury.When the local office   
 was closed down in 1983, there was a  
 Forester and 5 men employed.          
    Main species of trees planted were 
 Sidka Spruce,Norway                   
 Spruce,Lodgepole,Contorta and Scot's  
 Pine.
