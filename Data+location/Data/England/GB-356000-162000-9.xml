		<content>     In school we have two playtimes   
 everyday, one at 10.40 a.m. lasting 20
 minutes and the second is after lunch.
 The most popular games among the girls
 are hopscotch, skipping, a guessing   
 game called T.V. programmes and       
 mystery games made up by the children 
 with good imaginations. Freeze, Trees 
 and Stuck-in-the-Mud are also         
 favourites with the girls.  The boys  
 enjoy football played with a tennis   
 ball, padder tennis in the summer and 
 also cricket.  Falcon is a fighting   
 game in which everyone pretends to    
 have a sword. To win the game one team
 has to "kill" the other team. The     
 captain of each team is called the    
 hunter. Bulldog can involve both boys 
 and girls who have to run from one end
 of the playground to the other without
 being caught.
