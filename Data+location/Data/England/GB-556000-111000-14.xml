 Little girls at school picking the    
 daises and making daisy chains.       
 Playing ring a ring of roses and      
 skipping round in circles.            
 "Ring a ring of roses,a pocket full of
 poses, a tissue a tissue we all fall  
 down."                                
 Another game was cats got the measles.
  "Cats got the measles,the measles,the
 measles,cats got the measles,the      
 measles got the cats."                
 The girls play chase with the boys.   
 "Ip dip,sky blue,who's it? Not you."  
 This would tell the children who would
 be chasing them. Once you were touched
 by the chaser, you would automatically
 become the chaser instead.
