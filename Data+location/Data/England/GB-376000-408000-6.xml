		<title>06Farming in North Radcliffe</title>
		<content> Radcliffe is an urban area. The       
 population has more than doubled in   
 the last twenty years. This has meant 
 that farmers have a tough time. Most  
 of their land is near the expanding   
 town and has been used for the new    
 housing. The new housing has brought  
 other difficulties. People,mainly     
 children,have run through crops,broken
 fencing or frightened animals.The type
 of farming has been by tradition      
 dairying since grass grows well in the
 local climate,also the towns provide a
 ready market for the milk produced.   
 Some farmers in the area keep other   
 animals such as sheep, pigs or poultry
 and because of the popular demand some
 even keep horses and run riding       
 schools.As one farmer puts it,        
 "Farming near a town has advantages as
 well as disadvantages."Some of the    
 land is rented from Wilton Estates.   </content>
