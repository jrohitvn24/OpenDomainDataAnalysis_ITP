		<content> Okehampton stands on the confluence of
 the East and West Ockment Rivers,     
 where they leave the northern slopes  
 of Dartmoor. Both the rivers are      
 crossed by the A30 trunk road which   
 passes through the town on route from 
 the East to Cornwall. The town is at  
 the centre of a predominantly pastoral
 farming area, although its market     
 closed down several years ago. South  
 of the town the land quickly climbs to
 the Dartmoor National Park. Just to   
 the South West of the stands the      
 Castle, built a few years after 1066. 
 The town is a centre for shopping,    
 employment and education. Although    
 some new industries are being set up, 
 unemployment is higher than the       
 national average, many young people   
 being without proper jobs. The biggest
 local issue is the route of the       
 proposed Okehampton By-pass.          </content>
