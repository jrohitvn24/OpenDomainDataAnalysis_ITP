		<content> At 7.00 a.m. on every Monday in school
 time,I have my breakfast of muesli,   
 toast and coffee and watch "Popeye"   
 on TV AM.After breakfast mummy tidies 
 my hair and drives me to school before
 9.00 a.m.At school I put my lunch-box 
 in the cloakroom and my teacher calls 
 the register in the classroom. We go  
 into the hall with Class 3 for an     
 assembly by our head and come back to 
 work at handwriting,language work and 
 mathematics, in groups.We stop at     
 10.35 for a play outside if it is not 
 raining.At 10.55 we write stories and 
 at 12.00 it is lunch-time and we play 
 until 1.15 p.m.In Summer we have a    
 swimming lesson at 1.15 until 2.00
