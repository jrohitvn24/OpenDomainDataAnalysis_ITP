		<title>09HOUSING AND OCCUPANCY</title>
		<content> This area includes part of Hatfield   
 Broad Oak and High Roding.  There are 
 9 occupied farmhouses; 55 other houses
 - occupants divided almost evenly     
 between farmworkers, local employed,  
 commuters and retired people.  Many of
 the houses are of{historic interest.  
 In {Gt. Canfield}:- 3 are 15C., 9 are 
 16C. and 10 are 17C. others l8C. and  
 l9C.  9 properties are thatched, 3    
 have early 17C. wrought iron casement 
 windows with early leaded glass.      
 Very little {new building} has been   
 allowed in the area which is protected
{Green Belt. }Proximity to Stansted    
 Airport, given Government approval in 
 1985 to expand will undoubtedly alter 
 the blance and volume of housing in   
 this area. Gt. Canfield is Phase 4 of 
{projected development}for housing.
