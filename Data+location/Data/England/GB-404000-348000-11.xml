		<title>11Cauldon Church</title>
		<content>The Church serves Cauldon and Cauldon  
Lowe and is dedicated to St. Mary and  
St. Lawrence. There has been a church  
here since the twelfth century but,    
after a fire in the 1700's, it was     
rebuilt in the 1780's.                 
There are three bells which were cast  
in the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in     
London and the bells are rung when     
there is a service.                    
Today the beautiful old church is faced
with a large restoration programme as  
the roof needs repairing and the whole 
church need re-wiring. The church is   
surrounded by many old gravestones but 
there is now a new graveyard as the old
one is full.                           
There is one priest who is responsible 
for Cauldon along with Calton, Grindon 
and Waterfall. He is in charge of all  
the parishes and arranges the services 
for all four churches.                 </content>
