		<content>{Memories of an Old Resident}          
 Overton has changed a lot in  my      
 lifetime. There used to be a few      
 hundred people living here when I was 
 young (now 4,000 and rising). School  
 used to start at 9.00 a.m. and finish 
 at 4.00 p.m. Some people had to walk  
 miles to school wearing stout leather 
 boots. We had five weeks off in the   
 summer, one week at Christmas, one    
 week at Easter and one week at        
 Whitsun. In July there was a sheep    
 fair. I remember fields covered in    
 mushrooms every year during the       
 Autumn. Now I am old I am looked after
 very well by the community of Overton.
 There's a luncheon club and an over   
 sixties group.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
