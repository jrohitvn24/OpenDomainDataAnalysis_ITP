		<content>   When you are upstairs you can see   
Tower Bridge from the window.          
   The lady who lives next door to us  
is old. She is English and she is very 
kind to us because we don't make any   
noise. There is an adventure park in   
Christian Street where my brother fell 
off a rope and broke his hand, so we   
don't go there any more. We are lucky  
to live near the Highway because every 
year we can see the London Marathon.   
   My teacher at mosque trusts me and  
my friend Koyar. He gives us up to 30  
pounds to change into 10 pound notes.  
He sends me to the shop to get him     
something to eat or to the chemist to  
get medicine.                          
   On Friday I don't go to mosque so I 
play marbles. I've got 500 marbles.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
