		<content> The pupils of St.John's spoke to one  
 old lady born in 1914 in Paradise St. 
 which is part of Peel Way now. Further
 up the street was a{blacksmiths.      
 Before Peel way was built there was a 
 pub and brewery called The Swan. There
 was also a rag &amp; bone shop which used 
 donkeys to collect the rags.          
                                       
 St. Joseph's Catholic School stood on 
 Peter St. Whit walks used to take     
 place then with the Catholics walking 
 on Whit Sunday and the Protestants on 
 Whit Friday to avoid fights.          
                                       
 I started work in the mill at 14 as a 
{weaver}.I worked from 7.45am to 5.30pm
 all week and Saturday mornings for    
 13/6d (67.5p). We did not get holiday 
 pay. When you saw the doctor you could
 pay the bill at 6d (2.5p) per week.
