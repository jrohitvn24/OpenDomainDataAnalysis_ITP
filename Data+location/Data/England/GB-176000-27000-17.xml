		<title>17ATTITUDES IN MAWNAN</title>
		<content> Here are the results of our{interviews
 with over 120 people in the village.  
 Most were either retired or housewifes
 therefore it wasn't a fair sample.    
 Everyone was friendly and eager to    
 answer questions only 3 refused.      
 About half have lived here for over 20
 years. Only one person didn't like    
 living here, everyone else said it was
 a beautiful place to live and to      
 retire to. Most people hope that it   
 will be the same in the{future        
 although they thought it would get    
 bigger and join Falmouth. A few       
 improvements noted were street        
 lighting and wider roads. Nearly      
 everyone liked gardening or a sport or
 walking as a spare time{activity}.80% 
 of people said they were C of E, 4%   
 Catholic and 16% Methodist. 57% said  
 they didn't attend a{church}although  
 many of these also they were C of E.  </content>
