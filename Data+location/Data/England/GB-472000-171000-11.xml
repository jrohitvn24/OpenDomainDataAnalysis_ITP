		<title>11SATURDAY LIFE</title>
		<content>   My dad gets up at 9.30, has a cup of
 tea and gets dressed. He watches      
 television and has another cup of tea 
 with some toast and reads the         
 newspaper. At about twelve o'clock he 
 goes to work. He is a{taxi driver.}He 
 does not come back till seven o'clock 
 and thats when we have our tea. He    
 usually watches T.V. for awhile and   
 then goes back to work again. I don't 
 see him again till the morning because
 he gets home  again at one or two     
 o'clock in the morning.               
   My sister doesn't get up till ten   
 o'clock. She is lazy. When she gets up
 she comes down stairs and has some    
 breakfast. Normally she has a cup of  
 tea and toast or cereal. She gets     
 dressed at about eleven o'clock and   
 sometimes goes to town or perhaps     
 babysits for the lady along the road.
