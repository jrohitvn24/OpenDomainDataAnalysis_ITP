		<content>The lane verges support the greatest   
variety and number of wild flowers.    
These have noticeably increased since  
spraying stopped and the verges are cut
only two or three times a year.        
Primroses and violets are common and   
the white violet is also found.        
Honeysuckle and dog rose reappear on   
the hedges annually despite use of     
mechanical hedgecutters.               
  The River Dove supports a stock of   
wild brown trout and grayling and      
annual stocking with brown trout is    
also carried out.  Water rats can be   
seen also kingfishers and herons.      
There is a small heronry just south of 
the area.  Magpies have increased      
dramatically in the last few years and 
the area is inhabited by tawny and     
little owls.  Brown hares are common   
and rabbit numbers have built up       
sufficiently to be a nuisance.         </content>
