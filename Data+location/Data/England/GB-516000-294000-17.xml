		<title>17Frankie's day - 1</title>
		<content>   First my sister wakes me up at about
 7.30 am., and I get out of bed half   
 asleep.  Then its to the bathroom     
 where I wash my face and brush my     
 teeth.  Then I return to my bedroom   
 and go to my wardrobe where I choose  
 my trousers.  I put these on along    
 with a T shirt, a jumper and a pair of
 socks.  When I am dressed, I go       
 downstairs and pour myself a coffee   
 which I always have black and         
 sugarless.  I then wander into the    
 lounge to watch a bit of 'Good Morning
 Britain' on the television or to look 
 at my horoscope on the Oracle page in 
 the paper.                            
   At 8.30 I leave for school.  Its my 
 job to ring the bell.  After the bell 
 has rung everyone goes into the hall  
 for assembly when a teacher tells us a
 story.  Then its classwork until 11.55
 with a playtime from 10.30 till 10.45.</content>
