		<content> Mr.Parkinson,Chairman of the Parish   
 Council,told us about the letters he  
 receives each month.He gets letters   
 about trees obstructing               
 footpaths,complaints about footpaths  
 from farmers.Letters from people      
 outside the village who want to be    
 buried in Cawthorne graveyard,but only
 people who were born or have lived in 
 Cawthrone,can be buried there.The     
 council has to decide weather people  
 can have extensions built to their    
 houses.First the person writes to     
 Barnsley Council and they send it to  
 Cawthorne Parish Council who decide   
 whether it will be in keeping with the
 rest of the houses.The Council also   
 has to make sure that the buses run on
 time.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
