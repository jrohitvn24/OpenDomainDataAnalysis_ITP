      In 1985 we eat all sorts of      
{food.}I mainly eat Weetabix for       
 breakfast, and ravioli and brown sauce
 sandwiches at other times.  Weetabix  
 is mainly wheat.  Revioli is meat and 
 pasta in a tomato sauce.  Brown sauce 
 is made from dates, mustard, garlic   
 and vinegar.  Other foods are bacon   
 and eggs, mushrooms, peas and         
 tomatoes.  There are lots of meats as 
 well such as shin beef, topside and   
 brisket.  People eat a lot of food.   
 In 1984 there was a{water shortage.}  
 Lots of places were affected.  You    
 could not have a bath, use a hosepipe 
 or flush the toilet a lot.  There are 
 sometimes{droughts}in some countries  
 in the world.  These places have to   
 have food flown to them.
