		<title>02Farming in Ringstead.</title>
		<content>                                       
Ringstead was not mentioned in the     
Domesday Book of 1086,but it is known  
from archaeological findings that there
was a Roman settlement in Mallows      
Cotton to the S.W.of the present       
village.Remains of hamlets have been   
found to the S.W.of Ringstead and these
were the homes and animal shelters of  
people of Mediaeval times.Until        
recently agriculture has played an     
important part in the lives of the     
villagers.In 1869 it was reported that 
wheat,barley,turnips and roots were the
main crops and that the meadow lands   
provided good grass for grazing.With   
the coming of the machine age fewer men
have been employed on the farms and    
instead of work on the farm being one  
of the most important forms of         
employment it is now one of the        
least.                                 </content>
