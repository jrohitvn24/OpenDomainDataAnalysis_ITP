		<title>15Leisure and Recreation</title>
		<content> Leisure and recreation is very        
 important in people's lives today.    
 For the unemployed, it is a way of    
 filling time and making up for the    
 loss of 'job satisfaction.' For those 
 in work, it provides oportunities to  
 relax and to keep physically fit.     
 Squash and tennis are extremely       
 popular as there is a private tennis  
 club in Bridgnorth and a squash league
 at the local Leisure Centre.  Cricket 
 is a sport appealing to many boys and 
 men and the local club runs three     
 teams in Saturday and Sunday Leagues. 
 Bowling is particularly popular with  
 older and retired people - both men   
 and women and there are clubs in High 
 Town and Low Town - the latter on the 
 Bylet Island.  Karate and Judo are not
 so popular as other sports but there  
 are various clubs at the Leisure      
 Centre.                               </content>
