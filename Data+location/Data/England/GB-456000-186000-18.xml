		<title>18Cholsey Church</title>
		<content>We visited {Cholsey Church} because it 
was founded in 986, 100 years before   
the first Domesday Survey. There have  
been 63 vicars. There are different    
styles of windows which indicate that  
the church has been added to over the  
centuries. There is a large yew tree   
outside the main doorway, it has an    
iron band around it as it is in danger 
of falling down. The church is outside 
the village on slightly higher ground, 
away from thw area that used to be a   
swamp. Like most churches it faces     
east. There are many carvings around   
the outside and some are badly faded   
and worn through years of wind and     
rain. The grave of {Agatha Christie} is
in the churchyard. She was a famous    
author of mystery stories who lived in 
Cholsey. She died in 1972.
