     I HAVE LIVED IN THORNTON CLEVELEYS
FOR 5 YEARS.IT IS A SMALL TOWN WITH    
ABOUT 30 OOO PEOPLE. WE HAVE A SMALL   
SHOPPING PRECINCT NEAR AN OLD RAILWAY  
TRACK.THE SHOPPING PRECINCT USED TO BE 
AN OLD RAILWAY STATION.TO THE WEST OF  
THORNTON IS CLEVELEYS .                
     IT IS A MAINLY RESIDENTIAL TOWN   
WITH LOTS OF BUNGALOWS FOR RETIRED     
PEOPLE.THE ONLY BIG FACTORY IS THE     
I.C.I PLASTICS FACTORY.IT ON A VERY    
LARGE SITE WITH LOTS OF BUILDINGS.I    
THINK THORNTON CLEVELEYS IS A VERY NICE
PLACE FOR OLD AND YOUNG PEOPLE;IT      
IS SO CLEAN.                           
     I AM VERY LUCKY TO LIVE HERE THAN 
IN A STUFFY,BUSY TOWN. BY{CLARE EMERY}
