		<title>20AN ELMSTEAD PUBLIC FOOTPATH.</title>
		<content>    The{public footpath}has two        
 entrances, one on{Church Road,}the    
 other on{Crockleford Road.}There is a 
{pond}along the path.                  
    On both sides of the path is a     
{ditch.}At one point the trees make an 
 archway.There were many birds  like   
{thrushes, black birds}and{robins}.In  
 the ditches were many{insects.}We also
 found an old{metal sign}and a         
{motorbike wheel.}In one part of the   
 ditch there was a brick wall with     
 holes in it.                          
    The pond has a tree creeping along 
 the water and then going up towards   
 the sky.Not many animals could be seen
 but there were squirrels.On one side  
 of the ditch was an{apple orchard}    
 with about{50 rows}of trees and on    
 the other side were fields of{barley  
{and{beans.                            
                                       </content>
