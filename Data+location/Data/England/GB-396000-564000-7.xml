   This is a 25 bed hospital providing 
 care for elderly patients,some        
 requiring continuing care,others in   
 for a short period for rehabilitation.
 Day to day medical care is provided by
 Corbridge general practitioners.The   
 hospital is managed from Hexham       
 General Hospital,being part of        
 Northumberland Health Authority.As it 
 needs to save revenue,the Authority is
 considering closing the hospital and  
 reproviding its services within Hexham
 hospitals.There is strong local       
 opposition to the possible closure,led
 by the Parish Council.The Authority   
 argue that the building requires high 
 capital expenditure to bring it up to 
 standard,the local people argue that  
 good standards of medical and nursing 
 care are provided.A decision will be  
 made soon as financial pressures rise.</content>
