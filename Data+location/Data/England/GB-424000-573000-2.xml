		<content> Much of the areaÂ£s early development  
was based on coalmining and farming.   
Farming is still important but the coal
mines have ceased production.Dudley Pit
closed in 1977.The core areas of the   
villages reflect this coal mining past.
All the settlements have areas of      
ribbon development and modern estates  
both council and private.There are some
isolated homesteads both old and new   
separate from the main villages.However
each village still retains itÂ£s own    
identity.                              
 There is little new industry in the   
study blocks but large industrial      
estates exist within the area.Most     
residents work on these industrial     
estates or in Newcastle.Despite        
government incentives it has been      
difficult to attract enough new jobs to
the area to replace those lost due to  
the decline of heavy industries.       </content>
