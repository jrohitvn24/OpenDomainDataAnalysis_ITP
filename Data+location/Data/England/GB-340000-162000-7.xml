		<content> The main railway line from Bristol to 
 Weston-super-Mare passes through the  
 area. This is the main line that      
 serves the West Country reaching as   
 far as Penzance. Originally it was the
 Bristol and Exeter Railway which was  
 opened in 1841. It later became part  
 of the Great Western Railway. There   
 are also the lines of two dismantled  
 railways in the area which had a      
 junction at Congresbury. One was the  
 Cheddar Valley line which was famous  
 for carrying strawberries. The other  
 was the Wrington Vale Light Railway.  
 Today the main line takes Inter-City  
 125 trains. During one school day 13  
 trains passed in the direction of     
 Bristol of which 11 where passenger   
 trains. Towards Weston the number     
 was 17 trains and all were passenger.
