		<title>17Nesley Farm:Near Beverstone.</title>
		<content> Nesley Farm is composed of nearly 600 
 acres of land.125 acres are open      
 grassland for sheep.No silage is made 
 but some of the crop is cut for hay.  
 The main crops are cereals,winter     
 wheat,barley,spring wheat and spring  
 barley.Most of the sheep are          
 crossbreds:the Clun Forest from Salop 
 and the Suffolk Purebred.They also    
 have 660 ewes to use for breeding.They
 have 15 rams at the moment but they   
 hope to buy another 5.So far this     
 year,eight ewes have had quads.The    
 price of a lamb is high this year(up  
 to Â£38).The farmer is being offered a 
 low price for his barley(Â£105 per     
 ton).He has no intention of growing   
 any other crops this year.
