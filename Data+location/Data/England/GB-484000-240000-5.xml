		<title>05MY HOME IN MILTON KEYNES</title>
		<content> Great Linford is quite a big place. In
 Walshes Manor where I live there is   
 only one house which is empty out of  
 about 222 houses. If I want to play   
 out on swings I can just go out of the
 back door; there is a playground on my
 left and right. There is a shop just  
 at the end of the street and just a   
 bit further away is a school. I pass  
 the shop every morning to get to      
 school. Also there is a pond with     
 fish, newts, frogs and tadpoles. There
 are many kinds of fish in the pond.   
 Just at the side of the pond is bus   
 stop.
