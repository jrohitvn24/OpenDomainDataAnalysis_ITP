		<title>10FARMING IN THE KEMPSEY AREA.</title>
		<content>  Mr. Kite of Kites Farm is a dairy    
 farmer at Stonehall near Norton.He    
 owns 90 acres of land and 90 cows.He  
 rents his farm from the Hereford and  
 Worcester County Council.It is not a  
 generational farm.                    
  He has rented the reasonably small   
 farm for over 13 years. He is         
 affected by the EEC agricultural      
 policy in that he is told how much    
 milk to produce and at what cost.     
   Mr Kite sells his milk (which is    
 unpasteurized) to the milk marketing  
 board only for 6 pence a pint (the    
 current price of milk in the shops is 
 21 pence). Mr Kite thinks that this is
 unfair as he has the cost of both     
 buying and feeding the cows as well as
 the upkeep of the land in general.    
   Another problem for Mr Kite is the  
 theft of machinery from his farm and  
 damage to property by vandals.        </content>
