		<content> Mr. J.S.Dakin and Co. Ltd. farm a     
 large arable farm of 4200 acres.The   
 soil and climate of the area are      
 suited to this.                       
                Over the last 60 years 
 there have been changes in farming in 
 the area. The Dakin Company have      
 noticed that farms are now larger,    
 there are more farming companies such 
 as theirs, hedgerows have been taken  
 out and fewer animals are now kept as 
 it is no longer economical. The       
 government controls the price of      
 cereals and gives grants for the beef,
 dairy and sheep sections of the       
 farming industry. The Common Market   
 affects farming prices.               
                        Cereals are    
 sold to local mills. Cattle are sold  
 at Newark market. Dakins have their   
 own transporters.
