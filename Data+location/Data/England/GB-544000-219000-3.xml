Bury Green is an attractive hamlet     
about a mile west of Bishop's          
Stortford.It is reached by a narrow    
road from the A120.The centre of the   
settlement is a large open space with  
carefully mown grass,around which      
houses of different dates are well     
spaced.Other dwellings are built by    
the sides of narrow lanes. The oldest  
house is made from bricks &amp;  dates     
from 1665.It was enlarged in           
Victorian times.Others are timber      
framed &amp; plastered.Roofs are made from 
thatch,tiles &amp; slate.The largest       
buildings belong to the farms which    
have many outbuildings.Some old timber 
barns are in bad condition.There are   
also modern dutch barns built of       
concrete &amp; corrugated iron roofs.
