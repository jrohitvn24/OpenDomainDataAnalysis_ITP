		<content>      There are no doctors practising  
 in Etherley and Toft Hill, so medical 
 care is mainly provided by the groups 
 of General Practitioners in Bishop    
 Auckland.  This means a lot of home   
 visits to people who would have       
 difficulty getting to surgery.  There 
 is a small district general hospital  
 in Bishop Auckland, and two of the    
 Consultants who work there live in the
 village of Etherley.                  
      This area of Durham has a lower  
 life expectancy than the national     
 average for England and Wales, and    
 this is because of several problems.  
 Poor health is linked to the very high
 unemployment rate, a low average      
 income, and a high rate of cigarette  
 smoking.  The older people in the     
 community have health problems partly 
 connected with poor conditions in the 
 past, such as air pollution from coal </content>
