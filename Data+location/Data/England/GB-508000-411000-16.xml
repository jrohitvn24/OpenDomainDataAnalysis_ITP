		<title>16The pub at Kirmington</title>
		<content> The Marrowbone &amp; Cleaver is the only  
 Pub in this square.The publican cum   
 butcher was T.M.Frankish in 1861 and  
 presumably this dual occupation       
 explains the name today.This pub name 
 is noted in the 1871 census.          
 During the last war the 166 Squadron  
 was based in Kirmington,and spent     
 their spare time in the pub.They      
 have a reunion each year and revisit  
 the Pub and Church.                   
 In August 1985 a new Landlord,his wife
 and three children moved into the     
 village and pub.They are fund raising 
 for Chistmas parties for the children 
 and Pensioners.The real ale,Draught   
 bass,is the best in the area,and      
 people come from Grimsby,Immingham etc
 A pint of bitter now costs 80 pence.  
 The lounge bar is well decorated with 
 two real fires in the winter.In the   
 bar,darts  and dominoes are played.   </content>
