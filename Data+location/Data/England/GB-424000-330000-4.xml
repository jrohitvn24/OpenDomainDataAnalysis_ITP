		<title>04A TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> Our main road (A516) provides one of  
 the few links between the M1 and M6   
 motorways. But it is not a            
 satisfactory link, as a lot of heavy  
 traffic goes through our village.It   
 can be very dangerous as a lot of     
 people need to cross the road. We have
 only just had a pelican crossing      
 installed. A few days ago we went     
 outside to make a traffic census.     
 There were more cars in 15 minutes    
 than any other vehicle;  we counted 99
 vehicles going away from Derby and 137
 going to Derby. In one hour, about 9OO
 vehicles travelled through Etwall.    
 Because of all that traffic we need a 
 bypass but it would cost a lot of     
 money and our bypass is low down on   
 the Government's list of priorities.
