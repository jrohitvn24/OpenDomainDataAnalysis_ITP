		<title>09Hollinwood Market</title>
		<content>   At the market there are 40 stalls in
 the open and 2 that are not occupied. 
 All the stalls are made from wood and 
 they are open only on Thursdays. The  
 perimeter of the market is 124m. Most 
 of the stalls sell cards, clothes and 
 books but there are also stalls       
 selling fruit, sweets and other food. 
 One of the stalls was full of         
 different kinds of fish from          
 Fleetwood. There were more women on   
 the market than men. The only men     
 there were quite old apart from the   
 stall holders who were younger. Most  
 people shopped every week. Some people
 went shopping most weeks but some     
 usually went shopping in Oldham Town  
 Centre. Most of the people did most of
 their shopping in Oldham and bought   
 clothes at Hollinwood market.
