		<content> Schools are regularly visited by      
 a school health visitor. She looks at 
 our fingers and in our{hair.}Head lice
 are quite uncommon but are            
 occasionally found. More often, nits  
 are found. These are the eggs of head 
 lice and are cleared up by the use of 
 a shampoo which is given free. Our    
{eyes}and our{teeth}are also looked at 
 in school on a regular basis. Girls of
 ten years of age are able to have an  
 injection against german measles. The 
 school nurse also visits school to    
 show a film and to talk about problems
 which girls experience at puberty. A  
 while ago there was a scare about     
 harmful effects from injections for   
 whooping cough and measles. Some      
 parents refise to have their children 
 vacinated and so these diseases are   
 increasing very slightly.
