		<title>07      A SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> Up in the morning at seven o'clock,   
 Go to the bathroom to have a wash.    
 Back to my bedroom and get dressed.   
 Then to the kitchen for breakfast.    
                                       
 Mam and Dad they enter the room,      
 Switch on the tele and watch TV.      
 I feed the dog; put on my coat;       
 Take him for a walk.Then off to       
                             school.   
                                       
 In the playground I look for my       
                             friends,  
 Hear the bell and playtime ends.      
 Into the class in single file,        
 Take out my tray and read for while.  
                                       
 Register,dinner money, Service, then  
 We start work with paper and pen.     
 Maths, English, Stories and Rhymes,   
 Now its lunch and we have a good time.
