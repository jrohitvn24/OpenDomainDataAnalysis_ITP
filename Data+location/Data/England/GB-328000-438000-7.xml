		<content>{UNCLE TOM'S CABIN}                    
 This inn was the centre of amusement  
 before the famous Winter Gardens were 
 built, and is still a popular landmark
 today.                                
 The original cabin was built in the   
 early 19th century by Thomas          
 Parkinson, who was known as "Uncle    
 Tom". It stood 100 feet above the     
 cliffs to the north of Blackpool and  
 was a well-known meeting place,       
 selling toffee and ginger beer.       
 It was sold to a Mr. Taylor for Â£5.   
 A story says that around this time the
 book "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was written, 
 and a negro bust from a ship's        
 figurehead was washed up on to the    
 shore near to the inn. The bust was   
 hung up with a sign showing the inn's 
 new name. The original inn was        
 demolished as the coastline retreated 
 but the present cabin stands nearby.  </content>
