		<title>04USES OF THE WORFE</title>
		<content> Originally the tributary brooks and   
 the Worfe itself provided a source of 
 power for numerous mills along their  
 banks.The flow was dammed to provide  
 sufficient head of water.In a 2 mile  
 stretch of the Albrighton Brook 4     
 mills combined with several windmills 
 to serve the needs of local farmers.A 
 mill at Cosford was pulled down in    
 1969 and a large house built.         
  On the Ruckley Brook a bone grinding 
 mill was sited on the site of the     
 present railway bridge.It was pulled  
 down because of complaints about the  
 smell.                                
  The other use for the River Worfe    
 besides supplying Wolverhampton with  
 water was to supply the G.W.R. which  
 had a pumping station and borehole at 
 its crossing of the Neachley Brook in 
 order to supply trains en-route from  
 Holyhead to London.                   </content>
