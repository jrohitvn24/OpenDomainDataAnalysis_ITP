		<content> At Aldingham we saw  two  men  putting
 slates  back  on  the roof because the
 pieces of wood  that  were  underneath
 had  gone   rotten   and   they   were
 replacing them.  They  had gone rotten
 because some slates had fallen off and
 rainfall  had  got  into  the wood and
 made  the  wood   damp   and   rotten.
 First you  have  to  put  the  roofing
 timber  on  and  then  put the roofing
 felt  on to protect the wood.They then
 put  the  slates  on. They  shape  the
 slates into shape by chopping it  with
 a special tool like a long bladed  axe
 along the edge of a wooden plank. They
 leave a shape on the  other  end  like
 half of an hexagon  which  has  a hole
 in.It takes them about fifteen seconds
 to shape the slates.Then they nail the
 slates so they over lap like bricks on
 a wall each one covering a crack  then
 the job is done.                      </content>
