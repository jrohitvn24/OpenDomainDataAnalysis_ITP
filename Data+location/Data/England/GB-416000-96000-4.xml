 establishments in the area.           
    The old{RAF radar station}along    
 Ripley road was built during the      
 Second World War and is now used as a 
 Signals Training Centre.              
   {Sopley Camp}is situated along      
 Derritt Lane and was originally built 
 to house troops during the Second     
 World War.                            
    In recent times it has been used as
 a reception centre for the "Boat      
 People" from Vietnam and is now used  
 by the House Hold Cavalry to give the 
 horses a holiday.                     
    The camp has lots of roads between 
 the huts, barns and shelters. A large 
 gate shuts off the Camp.
