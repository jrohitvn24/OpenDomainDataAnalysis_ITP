		<content> Cartgate Cross                        
      North Street, Stoke-sub-Hamdon   
 which is normally a quiet little road 
 becomes a death trap where it crosses 
 the A303. This is known as Cartgate   
 cross. A year ago a girl was KILLED on
 a bicycle trying to cross the main    
 road. There have been 15 accidents in 
 the last five years. Local residents  
 also know of more accidents that      
 haven't been reported to the police.  
 An underpass or flyover is needed for 
 a safe crossing. Another improvement  
 wanted is to make a road along the old
 railway track from the A303 (known as 
 the Cartgate roundabout) into Martock.
 This will stop the heavy traffic going
 through many narrow roads into Martock
 to get to the trading estate. The     
 people in Martock want the old railway
 track made into a road.
