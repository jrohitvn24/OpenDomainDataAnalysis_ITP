		<title>16Villages north of Bedford</title>
		<content> The two most important villages north 
 of Brickhill and Putnoe are Ravensden 
 and Renhold.Both villages consist of  
 many old houses with old age          
 pensioners as owners.They are very    
 quiet villages with many farms around 
 them.There are a small number of new  
 roads with new houses.Many of the     
 houses,old and new,are very           
 large.Sometimes there are five or six 
 bedrooms.                             
 many of the farms are separated by    
 trees-a rare occurence these days in  
 this region.Many horses and ponies are
 kept on the farms even though the land
 may be owned by farmers and the horses
 and ponies by house owners.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
