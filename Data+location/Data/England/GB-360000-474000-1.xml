		<title>01General Review _ Leck area</title>
		<content> This area is in the parishes of Leck, 
 Whittington, and Tunstall. It lies in 
 the Lune valley and is predominantly a
 farming area. It includes the villages
 of Cowan Bridge and Whittington and   
 the smaller hamlets of Overtown and   
 Burrow. The landscape is quite hilly  
 and most farms are mixed rather than  
 specialised, averaging about 100 to   
 150 acres each. All the villages and  
 hamlets have lower populations than in
 the past and the viability of schools,
 shops, churches, bus-services etc.is a
 constant worry. There is very little  
 industry other than the Sheepskin     
 Warehouse company, several haulage    
 firms, builders, and joiners.         
 Ironically a growth in the tourist    
 industry has adversely affected the   
 area for the growing number of holiday
 cottages means fewer full-time        
 inhabitants.                          </content>
