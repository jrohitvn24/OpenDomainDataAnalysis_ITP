		<title>17Sunday in Whiston</title>
		<content>  Sundays are eventful for me because  
I get up very late and take an hour to 
have my breakfast. At 11.00 am I walk  
down to Sunday School at the chapel.   
I stay there until 12 noon.            
  When I come out of chapel I walk home
and my dad meets me at the end of the  
drive in the car because we go into    
Cheadle for me to go swimming at the   
club and dad to play basket-ball with  
his friends. After swimming I go and   
watch dad play basket-ball and         
sometimes if I have got my trainers on 
I play basket-ball too, just at the    
end.                                   
  We get home at about 2.00 pm just in 
time to see Eastenders on television.  
I watch television for the rest of the 
afternoon and then at 6.30 pm we have  
my favourite meal, a roast dinner.     
Later on I go to bed.
