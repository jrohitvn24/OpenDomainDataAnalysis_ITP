		<content> The religions represented in          
 Halvergate and Tunstall are Church of 
 England and Methodist.                
 The Anglican vicar, the Rev. Raymond  
 F. Gibson, is also responsible for    
 Beighton, Moulton, Freethorpe and     
 Wickhampton. Services are held twice a
 month at Halvergate church. There are 
 two other churches in the survey area,
 both redundant, at Tunstall and       
 Moulton.                              
 The Methodist circuit minister for    
 Acle, the Rev. Stephen J. Robinson has
 care of the survey area. There is a   
 chapel at Halvergate to which people  
 from Tunstall attend, where a service 
 is held each Sunday, and a Bible Study
 group monthly. There is also a Sunday 
 School for the children. Both         
 clergymen have a close association    
 with Halvergate primary school and    
 take assembly once a month.           </content>
