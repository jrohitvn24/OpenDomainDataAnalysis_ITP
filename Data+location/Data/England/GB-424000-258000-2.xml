		<content> traders and their skills have         
 disappeared and their dwellings have  
 also become private houses.           
 Barford has a very thriving village   
 hall where the following hold regular 
 meetings. Toddler Group. Play Group.  
 Over Sixties Club, Drama Group, Womens
 Institute and Keep Fit. Scouts,       
 Brownies and Girl Guides meet in the  
 school. Wasperton School is now the   
 village hall and has been temporarily 
 taken over by the County Museum as    
 offices to deal with the local        
 archaelogical excavations. It has no  
 shops or amenities of any kind. The   
 church shares the Rectory with        
 Barford. There is an hourly bus       
 service to Warwick and Stratford, most
 residents are car owners. Tourists and
 business men stay at the Glebe Hotel  
 once the Rectory.
