		<content> Hailes Abbey was a Cistercian House.  
 The Cistercian Order was founded in   
 1098. The Abbey itself was founded in 
 1246 by Richard, Earl of Cornwall who 
 was one of the sons of King John. The 
 Abbey was granted a yearly rent of 20 
 marks by Henry III in 1251. The Holy  
 Blood was given to the Abbey in 1270  
 by Edmund, Earl of Cornwall. The Abbey
 became an important centre of         
 pilgrimage. The Hailes Psalter and the
 Book of the Abbey were produced there.
 But in 1538 Thomas Cromwell, acting   
 for Henry VIII removed the Holy Blood 
 to London, calling it an "unctuous    
 gum, coloured". On December 24 Abbot  
 Sogar surrendered the Abbey. He and 21
 monks were given pensions and wages   
 were paid to 70 servants. The Abbey   
 was pulled down and the stone used for
 local buildings.
