 from{poor to good.}Two farmers owned  
 land on the{old airfield.}No          
 restrictions have been placed on the  
 farmers as the{R.A.F.}do not own it   
 any longer.Runways can be removed but 
 no farmers have broken up runways

 expensive procedure.The most {common

{grew hay and four grew potatoes.}Only
