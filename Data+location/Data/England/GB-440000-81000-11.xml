		<title>11MOTTISTONE VILLAGE AND MANOR</title>
		<content>  Mottistone is a very tiny village    
 with a manor house, church and only a 
 few houses.                           
  The manor is of Saxon origins and the
 church belonging to it was built in   
 the fourteenth century.The present    
 manor building was constructed in 1567
 but it has been extexnded over the    
 years. An earthquake in 1707 caused   
 a landslide and rubble filled one wing
 of the house. When this was dug away  
 in the manor's more recent history it 
 was found that the strong walls had   
 withstood all this even though the    
 windows and contents had been ruined. 
  The manor's rooms have very large    
 fire_places and the family evolved a  
 tradition that after the last winter  
 fire the ashes are left in the grate  
 until the first fire of the next      
 winter.                               
  The gardens are opened once a year.  </content>
