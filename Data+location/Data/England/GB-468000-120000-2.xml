		<title>02THE RIVER MEON</title>
		<content> The source of the River Meon is on    
 South Farm, which is just south of    
 East Meon. At this point the river is 
 quite wide, but narrows as it         
 approaches the village.  The river    
 adds greatly to the character of East 
 Meon, as it flows straight through the
 centre, seeming at some points to     
 divide the village in half. The two   
 parts are joined by a few bridges,    
 although for some of its journey the  
 River Meon disappears under buildings.
 There are many recordings of flooding 
 in East Meon village.  It was         
 especially bad in 1953. Therefore in  
 1955, some alterations were made. The 
 river was widened and deepened. Much  
 of its water is used by HMS Mercury   
 &amp; so it never flows at a very high    
 level these days. Many people fish in 
 the River Meon, mainly for trout.
