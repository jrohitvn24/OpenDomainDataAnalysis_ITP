		<title>10TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> When we did our traffic survey we went
 outside the school. It was a          
 Wednesday, a busy day because there   
 was a market in Market Drayton. We    
 spent an hour doing our survey by     
 counting all the cars, vans and       
 lorries passing our school. We found  
 out that of the vehicles we saw most  
 were cars. There were no motor bikes  
 which is a bit unusual. We counted up 
 to 140 cars and 1 bus in an hour. We  
 only get a bus service through our    
 village on a Wednesday. We also did a 
 speed test outside our school. We     
 spaced ourselves out over 100m and    
 timed the cars as they went by. Some  
 cars were going 90km/h, which is very 
 fast for a small stretch of road. Our 
 village does have a speed limit.
