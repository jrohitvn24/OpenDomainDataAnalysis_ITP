		<title>20The Wheelbarrow Races</title>
		<content> The Wheelbarrow Races began in 1953   
 but were discontinued in 1960 due to  
 a lack of competitors.In 1968 interest
 was revived and popularity of the     
 races sustained.The main event, The   
 Men's Race covers a distance of       
 nearly 2 miles taking the participants
 to the neighbouring village of        
 Micklebring, where at the Plough Inn, 
 the half-way mark, the competitors    
 drink a 1/2 pint of beer. There are   
 races for children of all ages, over a
 scaled down course. Trophies are      
 awarded to the winners and each       
 entrant receives a small financial    
 reward.                               
  The whole village celebrates         
 this event and there are side shows   
 and a Grand Raffle.                   
 The village is proud of the           
 Wheelbarrow Races and hope tradition  
 will long continue.                   </content>
