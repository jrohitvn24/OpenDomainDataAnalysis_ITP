		<content>    The limestone rock garden is one of
 the main features added to the 19th   
 century garden during the expansion   
 after the 2nd world war. The planting 
 is geographical with sections for     
 S.Africa,Australasia,Asia,Europe and  
 N.America,and many of the plants grow-
 ing there are of known wild origin.   
    The sandstone garden contains lime 
 hating plants such as members of the  
 heath family Ericaceae.               
    The original rock garden dates from
 about 1860 (one of the earliest in the
 country) and is now the Terraced      
 garden. It contains a collection of   
 shrubs and dwarf conifers.            
    Many species of ducks live on the  
 lake which was excavated from an old  
 gravel pit and is fed by a small      
 stream from Hobson's conduit. 17 glass
 houses contain the more delicate      
 plants-the Palm house is 45 feet high!</content>
