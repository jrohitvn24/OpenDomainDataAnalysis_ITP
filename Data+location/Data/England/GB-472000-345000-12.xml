		<content> Predominantly professional people,    
 commuting to the Nottingham area, with
 farm workers who have lived in the    
 village most of their lives.          
                                       
 Unemployment is not a problem and all 
 being well the Officers' Mess, Inholms
 Gardens will become an old people's   
 home and may provide some jobs for the
 teenagers soon to be leaving school   
 and not intending to go on to further 
 education.                            
                                       
 The influx of professional people into
 both villages has changed the life    
 style to some extent - it is often    
 very quiet during the day. It also    
 means that houses change hands more   
 frequently. However some of the       
 newcomers have decided they like their
 village enough to put down roots and  
 become long term residents.           </content>
