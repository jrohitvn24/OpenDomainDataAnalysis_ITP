		<title>11BUS SERVICES</title>
		<content> Shipdham is a rural village with few  
 local bus services. At present only 7 
 services pass through daily. Over the 
 last 10 years many services have been 
 withdrawn.  In Shipdham a local coach 
 service has replaced some of these    
 journeys.  Every school day the coach 
 service  collects young children from 
 the outlying villages and delivers    
 them to Shipdham School. Older village
 children are taken to High School in  
 the nearby town. The coach            
 company,Rudlings, also provides 6     
 services every Friday to the local    
 market in East Dereham.               
 These services are vital for residents
 of the village who do not have their  
 own transport.
