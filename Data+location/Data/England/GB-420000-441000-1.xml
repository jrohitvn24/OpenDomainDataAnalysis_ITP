		<content> Our area has 3 schools,{Queensway     
{Primary, Hillton Grange Special and   
{Springfield Special School}and we have
 all helped to do the Domesday Project.
 The block is mainly rural and contains
 hill farms,moorlands,airport,a lake   
 and Yeadon,a small town on whose out- 
 skirts the 3 schools are.It used to be
 in the{West Riding of Yorkshire}but   
 now is in{Leeds and West Yorks.}Woolen
 manufacturing used to be the main     
 industry.Now most of the mills are    
 empty or used for other things and    
 people work in a variety of small     
 industries or in agriculture,business 
 or professions and some are unem-     
 - ployed.Our most famous building is  
 the beautiful{Town Hall over 100 years
{old}and a contrast is Queensway School
 just 13 years old.Yeadon has a colour-
 ful High Street a big{Morrisons Super-
{market,}and an old fish &amp; chip shop.  </content>
