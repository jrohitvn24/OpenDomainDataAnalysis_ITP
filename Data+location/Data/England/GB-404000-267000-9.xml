		<title>09A Typical Day For Me.</title>
		<content>{I get up}at 7 o'clock and play        
 schools. For{breakfast}I have cereal  
 and toast. My dad drives my brother   
 and I to{school}in the car. Then he   
 and my mum go to{work.}Before the bell
 rings at 9 o'clock I line up with my  
 friends. In school the teacher marks  
 the register then the whole school    
 goes to assembly. After this we do    
 mathematics or writing. Best of all I 
 like doing maths. The first playtime  
 is at 10.30am. My favourite{game}is   
 leapfrog. After lunch I have about    
 half an hour to play again. Afternoon 
 school finishes at 3.15pm. I stay for 
 Drama, Craft, Recorder and Rounders   
{Clubs}after school. When I get home I 
 watch television or play on my bike.  
 On Wednesdays I go to 'Explorers' and 
 on Fridays I go to Brownies.{I go to  
{bed}at 8.00pm. Before I go to sleep I 
 do my 'Quest'  which is a Bible Quiz. </content>
