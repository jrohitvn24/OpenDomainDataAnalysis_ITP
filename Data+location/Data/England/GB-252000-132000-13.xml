		<title>13BARNSTAPLE'S LONG BRIDGE.</title>
		<content> The{bridge}was completed before the   
 end of the 14th century,and was       
 probably built by 1200 or earlier.It  
 has 16{arches,}the three{arches       
 at the town end are the{"Maiden       
{arches".}There have been several      
 suggestions for the name,one that     
 maiden ladies raised some money for   
 the{bridge}by spinning and teaching. A
 second is that maidens of the town    
 went to the river at this point to    
 fetch water.It was even considered    
 by some that{"maiden"}is a corruption 
 of{"midden"}or sewer and that the town
 drainage emptied into the river at    
 this point.Since it was built the     
{bridge}has been altered several times 
 to cope with the increasing traffic   
 over the centuries.The seal of        
 Barnstaple{bridge}consists of a bronze
 disc on which is cut a{bridge,}a      
 chapel, a cross and a spread eagle.   </content>
