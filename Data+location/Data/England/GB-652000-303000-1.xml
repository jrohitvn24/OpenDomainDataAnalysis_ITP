		<content> The main shopping area lies along the 
 High Street. There are four fairly    
 small supermarkets, a range of        
 specialist shops and a small shopping 
 precinct where a former store has been
 converted to a number of shop units.  
 The largest supermarket, Fine Fare has
 plans to rebuild on a much larger site
 to the east of the High Street, using 
 an old factory area on the reclaimed  
 marshes next to the river. It's       
 present site is confined and access is
 difficult, the new site will provide  
 some 200 parking places. Local opinion
 is divided as to whether this will    
 take trade from the present shopping  
 areas, or make it more attractive by  
 drawing trade from Yarmouth and       
 Lowestoft. Another shopping area      
 extends along Bells Road.
