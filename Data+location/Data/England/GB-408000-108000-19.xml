		<title>19Farming in Verwood.</title>
		<content> Cattle and arable{farming}are         
 predominant in the area together with 
 some sheep farming. The{Forestry      
{Commission}has worked{Ringwood forest 
 since 1919, with mostly{coniferous    
{trees.}The felled trees are used for  
 fences, posts, and chipboard.{Sand and
{gravel}are dug, leaving dangerous     
 water filled{pits. Rangers}cull hares,
 rabbits and roe deer as they eat parts
 of the trees. Fallow deer are rare and
 sand lizards, smooth snakes, newts,   
 frogs, toads and badgers are          
 protected. Trees are never cut near   
{badger sets.}Fawns should never be    
 moved, as their mother often leaves   
 them for a few hours to look for food.
 Badly wounded animals are killed by   
 the ranger. Part of the land is on 999
 year lease from{Lord Normanton and    
{Cranborne Estates}and the rest is     
 owned by the Forestry Commission.     </content>
