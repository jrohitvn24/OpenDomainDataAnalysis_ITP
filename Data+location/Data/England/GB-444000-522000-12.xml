		<title>12Billingham Town Centre</title>
		<content>  The shopping Centre was built with   
 plenty of space between the shops.    
 There is a bandstand, aspiral ramp to 
 get to the upper shopping level, a    
 playground with slides for children   
 and seats. The Forum Leisure Centre   
 was opened in 1967. It has sports     
 facilities and a theatre. Planners    
 from different towns came to visit    
 Billlingham. The Billingham Technical 
 College is next to John Whitehead     
 Park. This was named after the Clerk  
 to the Council. In the town centre is 
 a grey and black statue of a family.  
 It was unvieled by Her Majesty Queen  
 Elizabeth II on the 19th of October   
 1967.
