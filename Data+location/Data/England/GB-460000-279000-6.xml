 water.Fisherman buy licences to fish  
 there, it has many rare birds nesting 
 around its edges.Ornithologist study

 hides.The fear of losing these birds  
 and wildlife made South Kilworth and  
 surrounding villages form a petition  
 to stop an Olympic standard clay      
 pidgeon shoot being built, at the     
 nearby gravel pits.It was stopped,with
 the service of a local Q.C            
 representing them to a government     
 environmental office.
