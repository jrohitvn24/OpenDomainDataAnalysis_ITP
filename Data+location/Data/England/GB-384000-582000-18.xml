		<title>18FOOTPATHS</title>
		<content>  Around Bellingham there are many     
 footpaths through unspoilt attractive 
 countryside. The village itself is    
 pleasant to walk around with its old  
 buildings,churches and riverside      
 walks.                                
  Leading away from the village is the 
 attractive Hareshaw Lynn already      
 described and of course the Pennine   
 Way passes through Bellingham.This was
 the first of several long distance    
 walks to be reopened in England       
 leading through wild beautiful rough  
 and remote areas.Many people young and
 old are seen trudging along with      
 heavily laden packs perhaps ready for 
 a night at the Youyh Hostel on their  
 way to completing the long journey.   
  Out towards Redesmouth paths criss   
 cross the farmland,one going to an old
 pack horse bridge across the River    
 Rede, a good place to see wildlife.   </content>
