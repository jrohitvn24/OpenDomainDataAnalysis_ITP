		<title>14OLD HALL FARM,TANDRIDGE LANE</title>
		<content>   {Old Hall Farm}is a small mixed     
 farming unit of 45 acres. It is run by
 the Nunn family. They have owned the  
 farm for nine years. For part of the  
 time they lived away from the unit    
 until a new self built bungalow was   
 ready for them to occupy some five    
 years ago.                            
    About forty bullocks are reared on 
 the farm for beef. They are butchered 
 locally and the produce sold from the 
 farm. A few sheep are stocked mainly  
 for their wool. Some weeks before     
 Christmas over 1200 turkeys are reared
 and fattened for the seasonal market. 
 A few acres of land is used to grow   
 barley which contributes towards      
 animal feedstuffs for the farm        
 animals.
