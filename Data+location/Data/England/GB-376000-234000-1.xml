		<content>    The general impression of the area 
 is of grass and trees and a small     
 scattered population.  Mainly in      
 Worcestershire, with a small S.W. area
 in Gloucestershire, the block lies E. 
 of the S. end of the Malvern Hills.   
 9kms to the West is the Severn whither
 drainage flows, except that the       
 Wyndbrook joins the Leadon and then   
 the Severn further South. Woodlands   
 clothe the Hills which rise to about  
 250ms; lower land is undulating       
 agricultural, with some grassy        
 commonland. Dwellings, some very old, 
 some with large gardens, are scattered
 along minor roads, and there are many 
 farms, mostly small. A strong sense of
 identity within  parishes or villages 
 is apparent despite their scattered   
 nature. A major road, A438, runs from 
 N.W. to S.E. and B4208 runs from N. to
 S. through the middle.                </content>
