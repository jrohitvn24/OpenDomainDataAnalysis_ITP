The  Local  Government  is  the  parish
council.    They are elected every four
years by voting from the village people
There are nine councillors who meet  at
least once a month to  discuss what the
people want.                           
One  thing that  they have to decide is
where to put the  street  lights.    If
somebody said that a street light ought
to be put along a dark road the council
would have a meeting.   They would have
to decide whether to put a street light
there.                                 
If people have a problem they can  take
it to the Parish Council who can  speak
for them and tell the District  or  the
County Council  what is  needed  to  be
done. and if it is necessary they  will
pass it on.
