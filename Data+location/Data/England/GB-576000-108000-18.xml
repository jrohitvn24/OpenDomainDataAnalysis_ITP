		<title>18Fund Raising in St.Leonard's</title>
		<content> In these days of cuts in spending in  
 the Public Sector,education and like  
 services have come to rely more and   
 more on fund raising and sponsorship  
 to provide money for many items of    
 equipment etc.One way that is common  
 is the Boot Sale.A charge of Â£5 is    
 made for the use of a space for a car 
 and the owner then sells his own goods
 from the boot.Fetes,raffles,jumble    
 sales are also important ways of fund 
 raising.Sponsoring is widely used.This
 entails getting a business to donate  
 money for a specific object.In return 
 the name of the firm is advertised    
 e.g.on the jacket of a road crossing  
 patrol.This all takes time.Some items 
 thus paid for are videos,sports gear, 
 swimming lessons,library books,       
 curtains,mini-buses,computers and     
 software and assistance towards       
 outings etc.                          </content>
