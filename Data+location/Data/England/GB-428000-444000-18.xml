		<title>18PUDSEY/DISHFORTH MOTORWAY</title>
		<content>  Motorways in Britain were first      
 developed in the 1960s.The M1 was     
 built from London northwards,linking  
 it with Leeds.Industries in North-East
 England have since developed rapidly, 
 requiring a motorway link with the    
 South,avoiding the city of Leeds.     
  In 1973, 2 proposed routes for a     
 motorway,either east or west of Leeds 
 were published.It was intended to help
 industries in W.Yorkshire and the     
 industrial estates in S.E.Leeds.About 
 32000 vehicles per day were expected  
 to use either route.The present A1    
 route would have reached its capacity 
 by the 1980s and would need much      
 improvement in any case.              
  The Secretary of State,after touring 
 the area,agreed on the route east of  
 Leeds,based on the study of problems  
 of the environment and estimated costs
 of Â£90000000 compared with Â£150000000.</content>
