		<content>{Tracing your ancestors}is very        
 popular nowadays. It is quite         
 difficult to trace a long way back in 
 Sheffield, because it is a city which 
 has grown very quickly. People came   
 from all around to live here.         
                                       
    When you start your family tree,   
 you start by asking your parents and  
 grandparents if they know of any      
 relatives you do not know about.      
                                       
    After this you go to the Central   
 Library and search in the Local       
 Archives. The Registers of Electors   
 and Burgess Rolls for the appropriate 
 years can be very helpful. You have to
 take great care with the books, and   
 you can only use a pencil in that     
 room.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
