		<content>   The{grassland}is nearly all         
 permanent pastures grazed by stock    
 with a hay and sileage crop (bagged   
 and clamped) taken off most fields.   
 There is just one dairy holding of    
 Friesians, which are crossed with     
 Limousin or Charolais bulls to produce
 good{beef}cattle, which are reared    
 within yards on the holding.          
   The rest of the{stock}consists of   
 one flock of Clun ewes crossed by a   
 Suffolk and a large number of store   
 cattle and sheep bought in and kept in
 "halves" to be fattened off using home
 grown arable products.                
   A high proportion of{woodland}is    
 contained within the area. This is    
 either managed by the Forestry        
 Commission or by the Harris brush     
 company, for whom the sycamore and    
 chestnut are ideal for paintbrush     
 handles.                              </content>
