		<title>12CLUTTON-old mining district</title>
		<content>     We interviewed Mr.Owen who is an  
 old age pensioner who lives in        
 Clutton.He started working in the     
 mines when he was 16 and finished at  
 27. He worked in Pensford, Bromley and
 Bishop Sutton mines.He did not like   
 working down the mines but he got used
 to it.It was always pitch black, wet  
 and not very nice. There was some     
 lighting along the main haulage       
 road at the bottom of the shaft.At the
 coalface, they had to use candles and 
 then carbide lamps.He earned about 1  
 shilling and 11 pence. There was      
 always foul air down the mines. Mr.   
 Owen then went to work at the station 
 which he liked better because he was  
 in the fresh air. He likes living in  
 Clutton because the people are        
 friendly and he has lived here all his
 life.
