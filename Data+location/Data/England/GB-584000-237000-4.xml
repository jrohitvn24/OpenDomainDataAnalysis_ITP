 THE SITE OF THE FORMER WATERMILL IS   
 OCCUPIED BY A MODERN HOUSE BUT THE    
 MILL HOUSE STILL STANDS.THE MILL POOL 
 IS FISHED BY THE LONDON BANKER WHO    
 COMMUTES FROM HIS HENNY HOME. THE     
 GREENS IN FRONT OF THE SWAN PUB ARE   
 OFTEN OCCUPIED IN GOOD WEATHER BY     
 CUSTOMERS ENJOYING A DRINK OR THE     
 RIVER OR BOTH.THE SWAN WAS USED BY    
 BARGEMEN WHO WORKED THE PAIRS OF      
 BARGES ALOMG THE STOUR NAVIGATION WITH
 THE AID OF A HORSE, TAKING COAL AND   
 LOCAL BRICKS AND FARM PRODUCE DOWN.THE
 NAVIGATION WAS CLOSED AT START OF     
 W.W.1.THE WATER MEADOWS ARE SUSTANTIAL
 AND THE UNDULATING ROAD FROM MIDDLETON
 THROUGH HENNY TO BURES FOLLOWING THE  
 STOUR MUST BE ONE OF THE MOST         
 ATTRACTIVE DRIVES ANYWHERE -BUT BEST  
 OF ALL USE A BICYCLE.
