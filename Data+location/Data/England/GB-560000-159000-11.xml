		<content>     St.George's school was built in   
 1970,then it had seven classes,six of 
 which were being used.Atthat time 200 
 pupils attended the school.They mainly
 came from the Council Estate.         
     The numbers have slowly decreased,
 now there are only ninety pupils left.
 This is because many young families   
 moved into the area when the Estate   
 was first built.Now these children    
 have grown up and few new families    
 have moved into the area.Until        
 recently the school was named after   
 the village. The school at Wrotham is 
 now called St.George's because there  
 is another school in the area called  
 Wrotham School.This meant that the two
 schools got there post mixed up.The   
 Primary school changed its name two   
 years ago.
