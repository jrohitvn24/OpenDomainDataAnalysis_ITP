		<title>15Employment in Brookmans Park</title>
		<content>    Apart from a few local shops there 
 is no employment in the village       
 itself.There is really nobody without 
 work here as all the people in the    
 village have very expensive houses and
 run expensive cars. We did a survey   
 and found that most of the people work
 in London. We looked through the      
 school's list of what fathers did for 
 a living (father's occupation) and    
 found many were company directors,    
 lawyers,doctors,bankers and           
 stockbrokers. There were also one or  
 two shopkeepers who have shops in the 
 village. If people do lose their jobs 
 they do not stay here but move away.  
 There are some retired people who live
 in the village. Most of them have     
 lived here all their lives and have   
 not moved away after finishing work.
