		<title>10Tenants of Southwick</title>
		<content> All farms and houses on the estate are
 owned by Mrs. Borthwick_Norton, they  
 are let to tenant owners. Southwick   
 has its own private water supply, and 
 has a{'lay_peculiar' church,}which    
 means that it is owned by             
 Mrs.Borthwick_Norton. This is very    
 rare, and there is only one other of  
 its kind in the country.              
 The Carter family have been tenants in
 Southwick for nearly 5OO years.       
{Mrs. Annie Carter}lives in the house  
 today, and at{92}she is the village's 
 oldest inhabitant.                    
 As the village is privately owned, all
 houses are let. There are no new      
 buildings, because                    
 Mrs. Borthwick_Norton will not allow  
 new buildings. This is an attempt to  
 keep the village in its original form.
