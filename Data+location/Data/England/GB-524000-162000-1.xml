		<content> The London Borough of Sutton is on the
 southern edge of Greater London with  
 easy access to Central London and the 
 South Coast. It is bordered by open   
 countryside on its southern boundary. 
 Mainly residential in character, with 
 some light industry, the area is a    
 popular choice for commuters. It has a
 wide range of residential properties  
 and many parks and open spaces.       
   Sutton itself has an excellent      
 shopping centre with most of the major
 chain stores represented, plus a      
 variety of smaller shops, restaurants 
 and other services. Sutton's shoppng  
 centre is now partly pedestrian. There
 are good shoppng areas in other parts 
 of the district. There are also good  
 facilities for sport and entertain_   
 ment including Westcroft Sports       
 Centre, Carshalton and the Secombe    
 Centre in Sutton.                     </content>
