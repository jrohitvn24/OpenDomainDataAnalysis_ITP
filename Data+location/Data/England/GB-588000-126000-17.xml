		<title>17Stock's Mill</title>
		<content>  Stocks Mill is a Post mill, it       
 balances and turns on a big post      
 in the middle of the round house.     
 The tail pole was used to turn the    
 mill so that the sails caught the     
 wind; it sticks through the           
 staircase and there is a lever which  
 was used to lift the stairs while     
 the mill was being turned. The        
 Crown Tree is a big beam on top of    
 the Post; when this turned, all the   
 mill turned with it. The sails        
 used to be covered with canvas but    
 they now have wooden shutters. They   
 were sometimes called sweeps. To grind
 flour 2 stones were used; the bottom, 
 or bed stone, did not move and the top
 'runner' stone was turned by a huge   
 cast iron cog wheel attached to a     
 shaft which was turned by the sails.  
 The mill was last used nearly 100     
 years ago.                            </content>
