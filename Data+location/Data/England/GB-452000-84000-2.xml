		<title>02MERSLEY FARMS, NEWCHURCH</title>
		<content> The farming year starts in the{Autumn}
 The fields are ploughed and those     
 crops that grow through the{winter}are
 planted.  These are: garlic, carrots, 
 onions and calabrese.  After the      
{winter,}as spring starts, in{February}
 we plough and fertilise more land and 
 plant potatoes and more carrots.  Most
 of our early crops are covered with   
 plastic to make them earlier.         
 The months of {March}to{October}are   
 the busiest on the farm.  Asparagus,  
 carrots and potatoes are harvested in 
{May,}onions in{June,}garlic in{July,} 
  and sweet corn from{July,}until      
 October. {                            
 The other crop on the farm is peat,   
 dug from the marshes below the Church.
 People use this to put on their       
 gardens to improve the soil. This is  
 dug in the summer and dried.
