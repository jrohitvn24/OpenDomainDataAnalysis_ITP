		<title>16SOCIAL CONCERN-HOUSING</title>
		<content> A major cause of concern in this area 
 of Peterlee is the sub-standard       
 houses.When plans were made in the    
 sixties the Peterlee Development      
 Corporation decided to adopt          
 unconventional Houses.by 1978 however 
 these houses were badly in need of    
 repair.Flat roofs leaked and wood was 
 rotten.That year when Easington       
 District Council took over ownership  
 it agreed to carry out repairs        
 estimated to cost 20 to 40 million    
 pounds.At the present time many people
 are still waiting for repairs.Those   
 who have bought their houses are to be
 charged Â£10,000 each for these.Another
 problem is the pavillion,a large      
 concrete ornamentl structure which has
 become a target for vandalism and a   
 health hazard.The council has blocked 
 off access to it and improved it's    
 appearance.                           </content>
