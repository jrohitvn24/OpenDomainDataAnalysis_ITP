		<content> Living in a sparsely populated area   
 means that people have access to few  
 amenities.  In Smeatharpe there is no 
 street lighting, and refuse is only   
 collected once a fortnight.           
 A Devon County Council Library Van    
 visits the village every two weeks and
 is well patronised, particularly by   
 senior citizens and mothers who chose 
 books for their children.             
 The local baker from Churchinford     
 delivers fresh bread three times a    
 week, while the milkman from Luppitt  
 calls with the same frequency selling 
 dairy produce.  A butcher's van from  
 Hemyock calls twice a week and wet    
 fishman also comes round. A green-    
 grocer delivers fruit and vegetables. 
 The postman delivers the mail in the  
 morning.  Collections are made from   
 the postbox in the morning and        
 after-noon, Sundays excluded.         </content>
