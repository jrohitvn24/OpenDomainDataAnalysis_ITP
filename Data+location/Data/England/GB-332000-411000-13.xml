		<title>13TAX INSPECTOR INTERVIEW</title>
		<content>  I asked the inspector if he thought  
 that more people were paying tax now  
 than in previous years. He thought not
 because more people are unemployed. He
 also said the Budgets had taken lower 
 paid people out of Tax Liability. I   
 then asked him if he thought          
 unemployed people should pay tax on   
 their dole. He answered that he       
 thought that unemployment was a       
 problem that had arisen through high  
 interest rates, therefore the         
 unemployed should not pay tax on their
 dole.                                 
  He told me that the higher crime rate
 was the result of many unemployed     
 people stealing goods but that young  
 hooligans only shoplifted and mugged  
 for want of a better thing to do. He  
 said he didn't know if the Government 
 should try to create more jobs.
