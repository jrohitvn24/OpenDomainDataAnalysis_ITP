		<content> There are many sports clubs in the    
 area such as Cricket, Tennis,         
 Squash, Badminton, Snooker, Football, 
 Running and many more.Walking is a    
 very popular pastime because the area 
 is rural. The Pennines are near. There
 are also Social and Working Men's     
 Clubs and Women's Institutes.         
     Every village has a Community Hall
 where dances and other social events  
 are held.                             
     At home many people do sewing,    
 knitting and gardening.There is a     
 garden centre in Shelley called the   
 Pennine Garden Centre.There are       
 opportunities to compete with         
 gardening produce and  crafts in      
 the neighbouring shows which are held 
 annually. Also in Kirkburton is the   
 Civic Society, which though small is  
 very active.
