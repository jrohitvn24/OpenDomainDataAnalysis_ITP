		<content>   Mr Williams of Mylor Nurseries has  
 been in the agricultural buiseness for
 nearly 60 years.All the crops are     
 imported and exported locally around  
 Devon and Cornwall.The main crop is   
 tomatoes,but also grown are,lettuce,  
 potatoes,cabbage,barley and sometimes 
 wheat.All the tomatoes are grown in   
 Irish Peat bags.The temperature needed
 for a successful crop is 20C in the   
 day,15C in the night.Employed in the  
 nurseries are 8 part workers and 6    
 full time workers.As well as growing  
 vegetables the nurseries also have 3  
 acres of anenomies which is a good    
 Winter crop.The best selling flower on
 the market is Collum Stock.Mostly all 
 of the feeding and watering of the    
 crops is done by machine.
