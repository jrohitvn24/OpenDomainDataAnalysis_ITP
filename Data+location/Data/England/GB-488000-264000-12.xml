I like to play with my lego which is a 
cnstructional toy made of plastic      
bricks which I can make into all sorts 
of models. It has wheels and some of it
allows me to gear my model in          
connection with an electric motor. My  
sister's favourite toy is called 'My   
Little Pony'. It only consists of a    
little plastic horse with a long pink  
mane which she combs endlessly with the
comb provided. The current craze is to 
buy anything so long as it has a       
picture of Thomas the Tank Engine on   
it. I have pocket money each week      
amounting to 55 pence whereas some of  
my friends have as much as two pounds  
fifty. I spend some money on my toys   
and on sweets but most of my toys come 
at birthday time or at Christmas.
