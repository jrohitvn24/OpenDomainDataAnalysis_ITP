		<title>05Anglicans in Colden Common</title>
		<content> The Anglican Church was built in 1843 
 to cater for the growing settlement of
 Colden Common.It is located one mile  
 from the village centre and separated 
 from it by a busy main road.          
 The Church reflects many of the       
 problems facing the Church of England 
 in 1985.An average of 30 people attend
 regularly,rising to 70 on religious   
 festivals.Following the retirement of 
 the last vicar,the parish has been    
 without a full-time incumbent for over
 a year.The newly appointed vicar is   
 anxious to see the Church playing a   
 more positive role in the community,  
 being readily available to all        
 parishoners whether regular           
 worshippers or not.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
