 It is notable that there are few      
 organized clubs in the area.There is  
 the gym club and a lot in Easingwold  
 but most people list their activities 
 as being home-based.For example       
 television,gardening,videos,bird      
 watching,computers,decorating,snooker,
 pets and horses were all popular.The  
 only major exceptions were going to   
 the pub _ two in Raskelf,seven in     
 Easingwold _ and eating out.The       
 reasons for this are probably that    
 with the major activity being         
 farming many families are too busy in 
 the evenings and at weekends to travel
 far or have time for a regular        
 club.Certainly most preferred to      
 travel no further than                
 Easingwold,going to York only when    
 essential and rarely for the          
 cinema,theatre or music it offered.   </content>
