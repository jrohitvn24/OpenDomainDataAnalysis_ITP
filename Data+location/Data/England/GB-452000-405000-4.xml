		<content>    {Scawsby}appears in the Domesday   
 Book. The entry says:-"In{Scalchebi}  
{(Scawsby)}Alsi had five carucates of  
 land to be taxed, where there may be  
 three ploughs. This land belongs to   
 Brodeuuorde(Brodsworth) two carucates 
 inland and three carucates soke. Roger
 has now there three ploughs, and eight
 villanes and five bordars, with three 
 ploughs. Coppice wood four quarentens 
 long and four broad."                 
     In 1379 the monks of Bretton      
 Priory recorded that seven married    
 couples and thirteen single people    
 were living in{Scawsby.}Around that   
 time there was a weekly market and an 
 annual fair but they both died out    
 quickly.                              
     On the 1871 census there were six 
 married couples and twenty-seven      
 single people in{Scawsby.}Not much of 
 a change in five hundred years!       </content>
