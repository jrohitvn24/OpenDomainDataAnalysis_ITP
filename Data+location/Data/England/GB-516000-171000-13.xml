		<content>    The{River Thames}runs for about    
 3 miles through Ham and Petersham. The
 river has atowpath constantly         
 following its bank.The towpath varies 
 in quality and is very liable to      
 flooding.In the main the river runs   
 past picturesque meadows and unspoilt 
 land.                                 
   On the river's journey through Ham  
 and Petersham it passes{Teddington    
{Lock.}This lock plays an important    
 part in controlling the river's flow  
 of water.Without the lock the Thames  
 would probably freeze hard enough for 
 skating almost every winter and at low
 tide in the summer,the river would be 
 reduced to a small trickle.The lock   
 gates are worked by hydraulic power   
 and every time they open 200,000      
 gallons of water pass through. 175    
 million gallons of water flow through 
 Teddington Weir each day.             </content>
