		<title>15SCHOOL IN EPPING ON MONDAY</title>
		<content> Every school morning I awake to the   
 sound of my alarm-clock ringing.At    
 7.30 a.m I get out of bed and go down 
 and have breakfast with my two        
 sisters.For breakfast I have corn-    
 flakes and toast with jam or          
 marmalade.(My nanny makes the jam.)   
 At 7.45 a.m I wash and get dressed    
 ready for school.I always wear the    
 school colours which are green,grey,  
 black and white.My skirt and my jumper
 are grey, my tie is green and white,my
 blouse is white and so are my socks.I 
 am washed and dressed by 8.20 a.m.    
 I pack my bag with my lunch box and   
 project folder which is about an      
 organisation in Epping.I leave by     
 motor car for school at 8.40 a.m.When 
 I get to school I play in the         
 playground until the whistle goes.
