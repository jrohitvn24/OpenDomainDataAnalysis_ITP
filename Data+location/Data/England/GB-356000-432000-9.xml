		<title>09RECREATION IN GRIMSARGH</title>
		<content>                                       
In the middle of Grimsargh there is a  
recretation ground.  It is a big open  
space covered with grass.  It has some 
big trees and a wild pond.  The        
grounds include a play area, a         
football pitch and cricket pitch.      
People interviewed said they bring     
their children to the swngs etc., walk 
their dogs, come to play sports, to    
have picnics. Villagers are satisfied  
with most of the things on the         
recreation ground but one or two       
people would like a cricket pavilion   
and some seats and possibly toilets.
