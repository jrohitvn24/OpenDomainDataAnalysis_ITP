		<title>13Places of Work</title>
		<content>  When we looked at the way our parents
 earned their living we found out that 
 all the fathers worked and that       
 two-thirds of the mothers worked. The 
 occupations of fathers  were very     
 different.                            
{Work place}Most fathers leave earlier 
 in the morning, come home later and   
 more work away from Ticehurst. Just   
 over half the working mothers worked  
 less than a full day. A quarter of the
 fathers work within or very close to  
 the block while nearly another quarter
 work in London. The rest work within a
 radius of twenty miles of Ticehurst at
 places like Tunbridge Wells,          
 Lamberhurst, Wadhurst and Hastings.   
 Most mothers work in the Ticehurst    
 area.                                 
{Transport}One father travels by train,
 the remainder by motor vehicles,      
 mainly cars as do most of the mothers.</content>
