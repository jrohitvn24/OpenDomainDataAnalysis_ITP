		<content>The following pages reflect a typical  
rural area of Staffordshire.This       
particular block is to be found to the 
north-east of Stafford.The villages of 
Weston and Ingestre dominate the area  
and the only real industry to be found 
is on the Hixon Industrial Estate.     
In such a rural area,major buildings   
such as Ingestre Hall and the Balmoral 
tend to stand out.                     
Farming is a very important occupation 
in the area.The Trent and Mersey Canal 
is an important routeway,along with    
roads such as the A51.                 
In rural areas certain families tend to
dominate the community and this is true
of this block eg the Chetwynd family.  
The church plays an important role in  
rural community life and Ingestre      
Church is a fine example of            
ecclesiastical architecture.
