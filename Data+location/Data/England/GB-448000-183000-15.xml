  An appeal for a kidney dialysis      
machine was launched for a Mrs.Lawson, 
a village resident. The machine was    
purchased at a cost of 5650 pounds for 
use in her home. 6 months later a      
suitable kidney donor was found and    
Mrs.Lawson was able to have a kidney   
transplant. She is now at home         
undergoing a course of anti-rejection  
medicine.
