		<title>16THE PEOPLE OF UPPER HOPTON</title>
		<content> Most of the old people have lived in {
{Upper Hopton} for over 5O years. They 
 think the village is lovely and       
 friendly. They remember Upper Hopton  
 when there were more{green fields}and 
 the{new estates}weren't built. They do
 not like the new houses . They worry  
 about vandalism and would like the    
 village{policeman}to come round more  
 often, but most old people are happy  
 with the village as it is. Most of the
 younger people live in the new houses.
 They think the village is{friendly,}  
{peaceful and quiet.}They would like a 
 proper park instead of the{recreation 
{ground.}They think the new houses     
 blend in well with the old  but don't 
 want any more new building. They think
 that the bus service could be         
 improved.{Teenagers}would like the    
 rec. improved. However, they too don't
 want Upper Hopton to change very much.</content>
