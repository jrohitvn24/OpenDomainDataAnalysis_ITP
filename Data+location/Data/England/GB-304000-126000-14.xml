		<title>14NEW GIRL IN WIVELISCOMBE</title>
		<content>  I like coming back to Wiveliscombe. I
 have lived here before, but I was     
 younger and I don't remember much.    
                                       
 Wiveliscombe is one of the oldest     
 towns I know. The council are changing
 it a lot. They are building more      
 houses, and they are making the Square
 very smart and modern. Wivey has a    
 bookshop, and a larger chemist. What I
 do not like about it is that there are
 not as many shops as there are in a   
 town. But I would not like to live in 
 a town again as it is too noisy, and  
 you can hardly cross the road because 
 of the traffic. Wivey is so quiet.The 
 rec. has stayed the same since I was  
 last here.I expected there to be some 
 changes, like climbing frames and     
 roundabouts. I like coming back to    
 Wivey, and I like being a new girl.
