		<content> There are two playing fields in       
 Swinderby.One is situated off the High
 Street and is a play area with swings 
 and see _ saw.The second area is a    
 Playing Field situated in Station     
 Road.There is a full size football    
 pitch on which play the Swinderby     
 teams.There are home and away dressing
 rooms and toilet facilities.There are 
 also swings which are in disrepair at 
 the present time.The Parish Council   
 own the field but the upkeep is in the
 hands of the football club.This body  
 cuts the grass and keeps the field in 
 a good state.During the season two    
 games are played on the field each    
 week.The area is kept in good         
 condition,well drained and the field  
 is playable throughout the whole of   
 the winter months.
