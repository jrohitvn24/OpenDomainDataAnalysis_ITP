		<content>{    The village as seen in 1985.      
   "Our village is very interesting and
 there is always a lot happening. Some 
 of the houses are still thatched and  
 one day when we went out for a walk we
 saw a house being rethatched.         
   Around Hatfield Broad Oak are many  
 public footpaths; it is enjoyable to  
 walk beside Pincey Brook or Mus Brook 
 listening to the ripple of the water  
 over the gravel.                      
   One of the most interesting streets 
 is called Cage End.The name is strange
 but it has a meaning. About 150 years 
 ago there was a cage in this street in
 which people who had broken the law   
 were kept. Cage End is very pretty and
 most of the houses are old, some      
 dating back to Tudor times."  Compiled
 from writing by two children, aged 10 
 and 11, who live in the village.
