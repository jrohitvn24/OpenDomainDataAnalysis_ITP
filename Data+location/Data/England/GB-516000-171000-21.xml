<title>21A slice of life in Ham</title>
<content>

How life has changed in 20 years!  Quaint &amp; bursting with character -everyone wants a slice of Ham. Nothing it seems is too sacred.  Petersham Farm sold and redeveloped, the world famous Cassel Hospital due for closure with some of its 10 acres of prime land already sold &amp; built upon. This17th century  listed building faces Ham Common and is ripe for development.  Petersham Nursery threatened by developers saved by a local man, totally revamped is now a place for 'ladies who lunch' in beautiful surroundings.  The once traditional Hand &amp; Flower is now the Legless Frog with as much charm as it's name would suggest.&lt;br />&lt;br />Traffic pressures have increased significantly in  20 years with constant pressure from Friends of Richmond Park to ban trhough traffic in the park thus putting even more pressure on very narrow roads. Even in the leafy suburbs we're feeling the pressure of 'progress'.   &lt;br />
