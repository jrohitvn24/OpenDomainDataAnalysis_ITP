		<content> CHURCH OF THE IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY
 In 1945 a new Catholic parish was     
 established in Moortown with the      
 purchase of The Grange(a large house  
 with grounds, at Moortown Corner).Mass
 was said in the house and the Corner  
 House was used for special social     
 functions.                            
  In 1949 Fr. McShane bought Broomhill 
 Estate on Harrogate Road and the      
 Sisters of the Cross and Passion took 
 over The Grange.The parishioners built
 a hall whilst the church was being    
 erected next door.Both were opened by 
 Bishop Heenan. The church was built in
 Romanesque style with a tower and a   
 cupola.                               
  In 1976 a new middle school was built
 in the same grounds as the church.St  
 Andrews  RC Middle School caters for  
 the Catholic children in the N. Leeds 
 area.                                 </content>
