		<content> Guides was introduced by Lord Baden   
 Powell.1985 is the 75th year of       
 guiding.Guides is for girls aged      
 between 10 and 15 and there are       
 patrols in the company.There should be
 between 6_8 guides in a patrol.The    
 patrol should have a patrol box, in   
 which should be kept,first aid kit,   
 patrol subs,paper,pens and            
 pencils,books,balls,beanbags,string   
 and lots more.A patrol leader looks   
 after and is in charge of her patrol  
 with a patrol seconder,together they  
 make decisions.I go to Maylandsea     
 Guides,we meet in the Scout and Guide 
 H.Q on Tuesday from 7.30 to 9.00.Guide
 s is very good because we go canoeing,
 swimming and we have activities in our
 Guider's garden,I like going camping  
 best.Latchingdon's guides meet at     
 Latchingdon school from 7.30 to
