		<content> Guiding is a popular activity in      
 Carlton as it is one of the few       
 organised activities for girls in the 
 village.                              
 The Brownie pack was formed in l965.  
 At one time there were two packs, but 
 they recently merged.                 
 The Guide company formed in l963 and  
 is now run by its 4th leader, Mrs M.  
 There are 28 Guides, in 4 patrols,    
 named after flowers. The high-light of
 each year is a week-long camp.        
 The Ranger pack was originally formed 
 by the 2nd Guider, from 1979 to 1982. 
 It has been reformed by Mrs. M. and   
 has 7 members. The first 2 were       
 invested on the Humber Bridge lst     
 April l985.                           
 In July a Carlton ranger will be one  
 of l8 girls representing the UK at an 
 international camp in Jamaica.
