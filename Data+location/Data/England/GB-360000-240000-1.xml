		<title>01TARRINGTON</title>
		<content>   Tarrington lies equidistant between 
 Hereford and Ledbury on the A438.     
   Most of the land lies between 55m   
 and 75m,there is a small outcrop of   
 hilly ground to the South of the area 
 which reaches 175m.The land is chiefly
 used for grassgrowing for the dairy   
 farms. Other crops include apples for 
 cider,hops for beer,peas,seed rape and
 cereals.The grass is usually cut for  
 silage though haymaking is still      
 carried out.                          
   It is a thinly populated area with  
 about 550,mainly centred in Tarrington
 village,Yarkhill or Ashperton.        
   The number of farmworker cotttages  
 has declined rapidly over the past ten
 years,due to mechanisation and the    
 need for fewer permanent farm staff.  
   Most workers commute to the         
 neighbouring towns of Hereford,Ross,  
 Malvern and Ledbury.                  </content>
