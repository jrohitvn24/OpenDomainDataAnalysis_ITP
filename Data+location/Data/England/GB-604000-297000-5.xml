		<title>05Attleborough Bypass</title>
		<content> The bypass was opened on May 16th 1985
  by Mrs Chalker, Minister for         
 Transport, and Mr John Alston, Norfolk
 County Council leader. It took nine   
 months to construct and was built to  
 relieve congestion in Attleborough.   
 The connecting roads from Morley are  
 the old A11 and Silver Street. There  
 were doubts about its safety, and on  
 June 4th 1985 there was an accident   
 between a coach and a lorry in which  
 four people died and many were        
 injured. One garage and a public house
 in Morley have been closed since trade
 has been diverted away.
