		<title>17An Upton Family.</title>
		<content> We interviewed a family in  Upton.It  
 was the{Rowan}family. The road where  
 Mr and Mrs Rowan live is called{School
{Street.}The estate was built by the   
 National Coal Board for miners'       
 families who worked at the local pit. 
 The N.C.B.are selling these houses    
 off. They are sold cheaply, costing   
 about{Â£2,000 to buy}to the miners.    
 Some of the houses therefore are owned
 by the N.C.B. and some are privately  
 owned. The houses they live in are    
 built in brick. The houses are in     
{rows of six.}They all have a back     
 garden and a front garden. There is   
 also a large common in the estate.    
 There is a school next door and a bus 
 stop in front. The estate is tightly  
 knit. Mr and Mrs Rowan get on very    
 well with the neighbours. The         
 neighbours are also very kind to Mr   
 and Mrs Rowan.                        </content>
