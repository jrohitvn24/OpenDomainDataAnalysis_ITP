		<content>{SHIPLEY COUNTRY PARK}                 
 Shipley Park is a large area of open  
 and wooded countryside bounded by     
 Heanor, Ilkeston and Smalley. It has  
 been created out of the waste land    
 left after coalmining which took place
 on Shipley Estate once owned by the   
 Miller-Mundy family. Now the country  
 park is popular for people in the     
 towns, villages and schools nearby who
 want to spend time in the open air.   
{AMENITIES}                            
 In Shipley there are quite alot of    
 facilities for people to come and     
 spend some of their leisure time.     
 There are ponds for fishing; Osbourne 
 Pond, the boating lake and Adams Pond.
 There are plenty of picnic tables in  
 the woodland or on the grassy         
 hillsides. There are alot of people
