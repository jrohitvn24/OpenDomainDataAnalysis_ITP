		<title>03Big Houses in Horsmonden</title>
		<content>There are several big houses in        
Horsmonden.  Broadford is an old manor 
once belonging to the Austen family on 
the Goudhurst Road about a mile from   
the village.  Sprivers is a manor on   
the western side of the village which  
originally belonged to Robert Sprivers 
who died in l447.  It is now in the    
hands of the National Trust with       
beautiful grounds which people visit.  
Shirrenden, another big house quite    
near Sprivers, has not got so much     
land.  Grovehurst is a Tudor manor on  
the eastern side of Horsmonden which   
belonged to the Grovehurst family.     
Spelmonden by the southern boundary was
once owned by John de Spelmonden but   
then was passed on to Rev. Marriott.   
Hale Farm House, Plovers and Marle     
Place are all very large, historical   
buildings lying near each other to the 
South-West of the village.             </content>
