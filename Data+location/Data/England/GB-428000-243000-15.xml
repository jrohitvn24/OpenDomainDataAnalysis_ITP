		<title>15HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> Of all the homes in the three villages
 60% to 80% are owned by the families  
 living in them.Most have coal or oil  
 fired central heating with some degree
 of thermal insulation.                
                                       
 Life revolves around work,television, 
 car,house and garden maintenance and  
 hobbies usually in that order.The     
 financial and time priority given to  
 keeping a car and the independance it 
 gives is second only to the home.     
                                       
 About 65% of working people work      
 outside the immediate locality        
 travelling up to 30 miles away each   
 day.Many wives are in part or full    
 time employment,again most outside the
 villages leaving little time for      
 leisure after household duties.Only   
 20% of homes have children.
