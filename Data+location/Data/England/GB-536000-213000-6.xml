		<title>06EASNEYE COLLEGE</title>
		<content> Just outside Ware is the {All Nations 
{Christian College,}once the home of   
 the buxton family.There are 150 mature
 students from 30 different countries  
 throughout the world studying to be   
 missionaries.Most students are at {   
{Easneye}on a two year course unless   
 they have already had some experience 
 of teaching Christianity.{Anne        
{Dereybekill} was once a P.E teacher.  
 Six years ago while staying with      
 a friend she was told by God to become
 a missionary.She came to {Easneye }to 
 find out if it was the right thing to 
 do.When she leaves the college later  
 this year she hopes to go to India to 
 teach Christianity.
