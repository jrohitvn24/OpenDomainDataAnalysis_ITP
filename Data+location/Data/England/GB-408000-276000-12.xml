		<title>12A SCHOOLGIRL'S DAY CONTD.</title>
		<content>  IN P.E.we have the apparatus out and 
 we learn to do things like stretching 
 and doing twists and turns and        
 controlling the way we move our bodies
 around.After P.E. it is break and when
 we come in we may paint or draw. We   
 then clear away our things and go home
 at 3.30 if there is no club activity. 
  I walk home with my friend Christina 
 who comes to my house for tea on      
 Thursday.When we get home we watch the
 television for a while,later we have  
 something on toast for tea then we get
 changed.At 5.00pm.we go disco dancing 
 at Peterbrook School.There we learn   
 new dances and practise the ones that 
 we know.                              
  I go home in Christina's dad's car   
 and sometimes I watch "Tomorrow's     
 World" and "Top of the Pops".I go     
 to bed at 9.00 and then read for about
 twenty minutes before I go to sleep.  </content>
