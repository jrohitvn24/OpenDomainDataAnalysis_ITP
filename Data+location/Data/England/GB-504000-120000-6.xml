		<title>06THE WEY AND ARUN CANAL</title>
		<content>  The river Arun is navigable for small
 craft only up to Pallingham. In the   
 Napoleonic Wars a means was sought for
 transporting goods from London to     
 Portsmouth without having to sail     
 round an enemy infested coast.        
  The rivers Wey and Arun were linked  
 by a canal, though this did not open  
 until after the wars in the 1820s. It 
 operated only for about 60 years and  
 became uneconomic with the arrival of 
 the railways.                         
  The bed of the canal is now          
 overgrown, treelined and mostly dry.  
 In the NW corner of our block it runs 
 close to the loop of the Arun.        
  The Wey and Arun Canal Trust is a    
 voluntary society which hopes to      
 restore the canal. Some of the farmers
 whose land adjoins the canal support  
 the project but others have formed the
 Old Canal Owners Assn. to oppose it.  </content>
