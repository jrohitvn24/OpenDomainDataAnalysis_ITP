		<title>06FITTON HALL IN FITTON END</title>
		<content>{Fitton Hall}is a large,old,brick_built
 building.It was originally called{"The
{Manor of Fitton",}and was held by Alan
 de Fitton of the Bishop of Ely.The    
 surrounding land was at first very    
 marshy, but by the year 1221, 120     
 acres of the estate had been          
 reclaimed.Over 100 years  later,      
 Agnes, the daughter of Sir Lawrence de
 Flete  married Sir Bartholomew Everard
 and the manor descended into this     
 family, and remained with them for    
 several generations.When the          
 Buckworths took over, the house was   
 rebuilt.By 1728, the manor consisted  
 of 87.5 acres, 5 of which were        
 woodland, 11.5 were arable and the    
 remainder was pasture. In 1824 the    
 property was sold to a silver plater  
 from Sheffield for Â£2,990.A farmhouse 
 has now replaced the old  manor       
 building.                             </content>
