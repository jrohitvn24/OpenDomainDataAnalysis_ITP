		<title>01The Camps.</title>
		<content>{ Castle Camps}and{Shudy Camps}are two 
 small villages in the south east      
 corner of Cambridgeshire.There are one
 or two other scattered communities in 
 the area consisting of small groups of
 houses, for example the eight houses  
 in Nosterfield End.The villages are   
 attractive and have grown in recent   
 years.                                
  This whole area is intensively       
 farmed,with Wheat,Oil Seed Rape and   
 Barley the main crops.Peas and        
 Potatoes are also grown.              
  The countryside is gently            
 undulating,open,with few trees.Fields 
 are large,hedges few.Footpaths        
 abound,but many have been ploughed up.
  Transport is exclusively by road or  
 on foot.Families shop mostly in       
 Haverhill or Cambridge,as there are   
 only three shops in this area.
