		<title>19Jesmond suburb of Newcastle</title>
		<content>    Jesmond is close to the city       
 centre.  There is the large Town Moor 
 to the West.  In Jesmond there are    
 many amenities including a public     
 bath, garages, commercial hotels a    
 branch library and a shopping street. 
 Jesmond has two Metro stations for    
 efficient and cheap transport to town.
 The Dene on the East is a large green 
 park area and gives Jesmond the       
 contrast of city centre access and    
 quiet pleasant grassy areas.          
    The people of Jesmond come from    
 different backgrounds and because it  
 is near the University, hospitals and 
 Polytechnic both professional         
 people and students live there.  The  
 city end has a lot of houses converted
 to offices but it also has Brandling  
 Village a conservation area of        
 gentrified housing.  The North end has
 much larger residences.               </content>
