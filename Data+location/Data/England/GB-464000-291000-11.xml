		<content> My name is Emma. I usually get up at  
 7.30 and after getting dressed and    
 having breakfast I have a play with my
 cat before I go to school.Normally at 
 school we do maths and English in the 
 mornings and in the afternoons we do  
 Topic, painting, sewing, drawing or   
 clay work. We have a 15 minute        
 playtime in the morning and one and a 
 half hours for lunch. Istay at school 
 and play all kinds of games with my   
 friends in my class.When I go home at 
 3.30 I have a drink and play with my  
 cat.Sometimes I go to play with my    
 friends who live nearby. Then when dad
 comes home from work we have tea.After
 tea Iwatch some television or have a  
 fight with my brother. At 7>30 I get  
 ready for bed. When I am in bed Iread 
 for about 20 minutes then my mummy or 
 daddy switches off my light.
