		<content>{Power in the home}in this area comes  
 almost entirely from electricity,     
 although some people use propane gas  
 to cook.                              
{Electricity}is used to light and heat 
 the houses. Things like Economy 7 are 
 used to save cost and conserve energy.
 Economy 7 is when the electricity     
 boards charge less for night time     
 electricity. This is to encourage     
 people to use surplus electricity     
 produced by the power stations at     
 night. {                              
{At the power stations,}most           
 electricity is made using coal. The   
 other sources of energy, in order of  
 importance, are: nuclear power, oil,  
 hydro-electric schemes.               
{The main power for road transport     
 comes from petrol, apart from lorries 
 which use diesel oil and milk floats  
 which are electric powered.           </content>
