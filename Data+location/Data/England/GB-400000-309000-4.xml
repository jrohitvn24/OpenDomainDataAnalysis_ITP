		<content>Two popular playground games are       
marbles and Polo. Marbles is played by 
two people trying  to hit small glass  
or metal balls called marbles by       
rolling them along the playground.When 
you hit your opponents marble you win  
one of his marbles.There are many kinds
of glass marbles.A Bare Lady is a      
clear  glass marble and a Steely is a  
metal ball.A Spec is black with lots of
coloured spots on.Other names are      
Gobbies,Flobbers,Bullseye,Oily, Devil  
and China. In the game Polo one person 
is on and he or she chooses a group    
name such as Shoes,Cars,Trees or Houses
Each person playing thinks of a member 
of that group.If the group is shoes    
and the person on picks sandals,anyone 
who thought of sandals races him       
or her round the playground. The one   
who is back first and shouts Polo is   
on.  RACHEL,VANESSA,MIRANDA, aged 10   </content>
