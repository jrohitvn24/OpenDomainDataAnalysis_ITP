		<content> Two thirds of the land is used to     
 grow                                  
 grass to feed the cattle, sheep and a 
 few goats. The grass is mainly        
 ryegrass and white clover. The few    
 permanent pastures contain cocksfoot, 
 timothy, yorkshire fog and other      
 meadow grasses. Grassland weeds are   
 mainly chickweed, poa, thistles, docks
 and ragwort. One third of the land    
 grows wheat, barley, maize and fodder 
 beet. Weeds and diseases are          
 controlled by spraying. The grain is  
 harvested by combine and is handled in
 bulk. Some straw is burnt but most is 
 baled for feeding and bedding stock.  
 All the land is under-drained with    
 plastic or clay pipes. Adequate lime, 
 phosphate, potash and nitrogen are    
 provided to ensure high production.
