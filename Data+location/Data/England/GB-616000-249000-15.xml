		<content>Originally a Suffolk Longhouse built in
1550 with Victorian additons in 1850.  
There are still Tudor beams inside the 
house. The present owners are not local
and there are only 3 acres left of farm
land which was sold to Manor Farm,     
Henley.                                
1980's - Pleased that despite modern   
technology land still being farmed     
although hedges are getting fewer.     
Owner added that she hoped there would 
be jobs for all in the future.
