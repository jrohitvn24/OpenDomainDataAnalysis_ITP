		<title>16THE LIVE-AID CONCERT</title>
		<content>  Last Saturday 13th July there was a  
 great concert held which was televised
 and seen in 147 countries world wide. 
 It was supposed to be the greatest    
 concert ever to have taken place on   
 Earth. It was a fund raising event in 
 aid of the starving people in Africa. 
 The concert went on for as long as 16 
 hours. From 12 p.m until 10 p.m it was
 held at Wembley Stadium, then it went 
 over to Philadelphia in the USA.      
 Our class on average liked the        
 pop_star Paul Young the best. The     
 pop_stars were very good they worked  
 very hard to raise money for the      
 hungry people. There were crowds and  
 crowds of people watching so everybody
 must have been very nervous. Now      
 people are making donations everyday. 
 Â£50 million pounds has been raised so 
 far, world wide.                      
                                       </content>
