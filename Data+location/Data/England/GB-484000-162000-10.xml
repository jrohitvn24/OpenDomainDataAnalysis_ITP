		<content> A Saturday Out                        
                                       
    After getting up and breakfasting  
 at 10 a.m. we packed a lunch and got  
 ready to go out.                      
                                       
    At 11.15 we went swimming at       
 Bracknell. We stayed for about 3/4    
 hour. Then we went to Virginia Water  
 where we had a picnic at 1 o'clock.   
                                       
    After lunch we had an ice cream and
 walked round the lake and gardens.    
 After a rest we walked back to the    
 car. By that time it was about 5 p.m. 
 so we sat dangling our feet in the    
 water eating another ice cream.       
                                       
    It was then time to return home for
 tea.We spent the evening watching T.V.
