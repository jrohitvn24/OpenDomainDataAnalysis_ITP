		<title>18MOBILE LIBRARY</title>
		<content> The Mobile Library comes to Great     
 Easton and Duton Hill on Wednesdays.  
 It is a yellow van with white writing 
 saying "Essex County Library". It     
 waits near the village hall, arriving 
 between 3.15 _ 3.35 pm and waiting for
 20 minutes.It sometimes stays there   
 longer depending on how many people go
 for books. They get new books twice a 
 month.Some people said they are very  
 exciting books but their mums must get
 them while they are at school.The     
 uniform they wear is black with their 
 own clothes underneath. Most people   
 said they are very friendly people    
 because they don't rush while you are 
 looking for books. I think it is a    
 very good service to have in the      
 country so that people can read books 
 when they want.
