		<title>03THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> The modern village has grown up around
 the Church of All Hallows,which dates 
 back to Norman times.The church tower 
 is 13th century and so is the font.The
 church also contains some interesting 
 bench ends probably 15th century with 
 panels enclosing shields,some of which
 have initials,possibly of the         
 occupants of the pews.                
    In one case there is a rare        
 unmutilated scene of the crucifixion. 
 This is believed to be the better of  
 the only two remaining in England.    
     The north aisle,with waggon roof  
 and granite pillarsdates from the     
 early 16th century.It has always been 
 thought that the granite came from    
 Lundy Island.The graveyard contains   
 many interesting stones.
