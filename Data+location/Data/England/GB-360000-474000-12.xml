		<content>{ROMANS}_ There is a Roman road through
 our block.The Roman General Agricola  
 came north in 79A.D. to conquer a     
 local tribe called Brigantes and so he
 built this road from Ribchester to    
 Carlisle.There is a "Roman British    
 Settlement"midway between Low House   
 Farm (just off our block) and         
 Collingholme Farm .Through a field    
 gate to the left it is quite a large  
 circular site,lots of stones showing  
 through the ground as yet not         
 excavated.                            
{SHOPS AND PUBS}_ There were two Beer  
 Houses the "Red Lion" which now is    
 Temperance Farm and "The Black Bull"  
 which now is Greystone Cottage and    
 which also had a sweet shop in the    
 front room. There was also a          
 Blacksmith,a Cobbler,and the village  
 shop.
