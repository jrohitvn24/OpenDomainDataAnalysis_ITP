		<content>    Bordering on the southern side of  
 the A.35 road and at the top of       
 Chideock hill there is the only garage
 and service station within the area of
 our survey. This is Frodsham motors   
 and it is owned and managed by Mr. and
 Mrs.Frodsham.                         
    There is a large repair shop for   
 vehicles and outside there are three  
 fuel supply pumps 2 for petrol and one
 deisel. The pumps are protected       
 overhead by a canopy and are not      
 "self_Service". An office /shop abuts 
 onto the main building.               
    In addition to normal workshop     
 facilities, including an M.O.T.       
 Testing bay, the garage operates a    
 nationwide recovery service for light 
 and heavy vehicles.
