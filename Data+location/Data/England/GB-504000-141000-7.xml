		<content> This is a stable area with most homes 
 consisting of 2 parents and 2 or more 
 children.  Pets are popular: dogs,    
 cats, horses, goats, hampsters,       
 gerbils, budgerigars and poultry.     
 Domestic activities include care of   
 these pets, gardening, home decoration
 and home alteration.  The level of    
 safety in the home is high.  Most     
 families cook all their meals, growing
 some of their fruit and vegetables.  A
 few families eat out occasionally and 
 also buy convenience foods.  Freezers 
 are popular.  in some large houses    
 there might be a resident staff,      
 including a cook.  Most families are  
 conscious of the cost and nutritive   
 value of food with growing interest in
 wholefoods and vegetarianism.  Home   
 entertainment include T.V., radio,    
 computer games, books, card games.    
 Newspapers reach most homes daily.    </content>
