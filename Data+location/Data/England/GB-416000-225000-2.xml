 The farm is down the{Evesham Road     
 about 1km from Stow. It belongs to the
{Abbotswood Estate.}It is about 1000   
 acres and is a{mixed farm.}There are  
 about 500{beef cattle}and 1000        
 breeding{ewes}which had about 1800    
 lambs this season. Current prices are 
 about Â£500 per head of cattle and Â£43 
 for a lamb.{Crops}grown are wheat,    
 malting barley, oats and fodder beet. 
 Large quantities of hay are produced  
 for cattle feed.                      
 The farm is not typical because it has
 quite a lot of permanent pasture. The 
 fleeces also provide a source of      
 income but the farmer is being pressed
 to increase profits. Intensive use of 
{machinery}has reduced the staff needed
 to work the farm.
