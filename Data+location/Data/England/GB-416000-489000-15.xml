		<title>15CHURCHES AND CHAPELS</title>
		<content>   There is a small church at Finghall 
 dedicated to St. Andrew.The first     
 church was probably built in the      
 1100's,but only small parts of this   
 early church remain.The style is Early
 English.It has a small tower.         
                                       
   The living is now combined with the 
 livings of Hauxwell and Spennithorne. 
 The present rector lives at           
 Spennithorne.About 120 people can     
 attend service.                       
                                       
   There is also a small Wesleyan      
 Chapel at Finghall,erected in 1909 to 
 replace an older smaller chapel,now in
 ruins.

 Chapel was built in 1905.It is still  
 in use today and is situated in Mill
