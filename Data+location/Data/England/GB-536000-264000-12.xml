		<content>   A wide variety of groups cater for  
 leisure needs. These include the      
 Women's Institute, the Mother's Union,
 and the Wives' Club, which each meet  
 monthly, and the Over-60s with their  
 fortnightly meetings. The Sports and  
 Social Club is very active, their     
 Pavilion on the Recreation Ground     
 opening every evening.                
  There are groups for Badminton,      
 Billiards, Tennis and Aerobics, and a 
 keen interest in Bellringing which    
 goes back more than a century.        
  For small children there is the Play 
 Group on three mornings a week, and   
 the weekly Mothers and Toddlers group.
 Older children have Cubs, Brownies,   
 Guides and the Girls' Venture Corps   
 and the Air Training Corps.           
  Perhaps it is not surprising that    
 there are only the two pubs!
