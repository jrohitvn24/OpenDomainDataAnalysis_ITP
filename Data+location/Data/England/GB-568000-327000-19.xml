		<content> The ancient village of Appleton is now
 only a tiny hamlet on the outskirts of
 West Newton. All that is noticed by   
 the casual passer-by, is the ruined   
 church and the rather splendid Water  
 tower which is a feature of the       
 landscape for many miles around.      
                                       
 For many years The Queen of Norway    
 lived in Appleton House, the ruins of 
 which were demolished last year.      
                                       
 Now only about 15 people live in      
 Appleton, most of them working at     
 Appleton Farm.
