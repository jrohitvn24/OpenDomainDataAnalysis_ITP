		<content> The area is split by many hills and   
 valleys running down to Chelfham. The 
 hilltops and flattish valley bottoms  
 are mostly pasture with many mainly   
 deciduous woods clinging to  steeper  
 hillsides. Farms are small,devoted    
 principally to sheep, a few cows and  
 some fattening of bullocks. Any crops 
 grown are mostly for cattle feed. The 
 movement of sheep flocks up and down  
  main road freqently halts traffic.   
 Chelfham Mill School for maladjusted  
 boys, in the shadow of the old Lynton 
 Railway viaduct, run a small mixed    
 farm for training purposes. Lower     
 Loxhore, an offshoot of Loxhore, and  
 Stoke River with its mainly unrestored
 church are small hamlets.Journeys give
 oportunites for wildlife spotting.    
 Herons along the river can be seen    
 from the higher viewpoint of the bus. 
 Wheeling buzzards are frequent        </content>
