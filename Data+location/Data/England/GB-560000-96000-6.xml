		<title>06LAW AND ORDER IN EASTBOURNE</title>
		<content> The summer of 1985 has seen an        
 outbreak of street disturbances in    
 Eastbourne.                           
 These have occurred when the          
 Night_Clubs have closed at around     
 2a.m. They have resulted in assaults  
 on the police and damage to property  
 and parked vehicles.                  
 The police have claimed that the      
 offences are drink related.A number of
 people have appeared in court,some    
 received fines of up to Â£300 and a few
 have received custodial sentenecs.    
 The police have also expressed concern
 about the level of under_age drinking 
 which is taking place in the town.
