		<title>07ASTRO SPORTS CLUB WADDINGTON</title>
		<content>   In lower Waddington there is a      
 modern club called the Astro Club. It 
 is the most popular club in           
 Waddington. More than 1000 people go  
 in a week to drink, play sports or go 
 on the sunbed.The sports include pool,
 snooker, squash, gymnastics, and      
 tennis. There are three courts for    
 playing squash. The owners would like 
 a swimming pool but they cannot       
 because the land they own is too      
 small. Downstairs there is a          
 restaurant and a bar. On Monday,      
 Tuesday and Wednesday the club is open
 12 hours a day and on Thursday, Friday
 and Saturday it is open 15 hours. On  
 Thursday, Friday and Saturday there is
 a disco each night. Membership of the 
 Club costs Â£89 a year and although    
 children cannot join they are allowed 
 in the club with their parents.
