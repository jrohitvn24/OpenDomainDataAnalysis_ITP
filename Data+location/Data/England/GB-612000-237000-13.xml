TABLE TENNIS CLUB Every Wednesday in   
the winter Mrs Dale runs a table tennis
club. They have two table tennis tables
and one snooker table. It costs 20p to 
go each time and the junior session    
lasts from 6.00-7.00.The session for   
older children lasts from 7.00-9.00.   
    Sometimes in the winter Mrs.Dale   
runs discos in the village hall.       
    Many local people spend their      
evenings in one of the three local     
pubs.The Waterloo is a bar rather than 
a pub and is run by Mr Lee the         
shopkeeper.It is very small indeed.The 
pubs are called The White Horse and    
The Wheatsheaf.                        
    At Alton Water Reservoir you can go
fishing for pike, roach, eels ,perch   
and other freshwater fish.You can also 
go windsurfing and sailing.
