		<title>16Life in Bubwith</title>
		<content> We asked a number of old people in    
 Bubwith how the village had changed   
 since World War II. These are some of 
 the things they mentioned.            
 There are fewer shops so people have  
 to travel further to buy the things   
 they need. However there is poorer    
 public transport since the railway was
 closed in 1953. Other changes include 
 the building of a new school and more 
 houses. We think advantages of living 
 in Bubwith are that there is less     
 traffic, so it is quieter than a town.
 There are also  more places to go for 
 walks in the country.                 
 Disadvantages are that there are not  
 so many shops so people have to       
 travel a long way to get clothes etc. 
 There are also fewer jobs for people.
