		<content>  Mr Wykes told us that he went to the 
 school near the church. There were    
 about l00 children from 3 to l3. They 
 did not go to Harrold or Sharnbrook in
 those days. The children walked to    
 school.  Some walked across the fields
 from Farndish and Hinwick Lodge. They 
 brought sandwiches for dinner. The    
 others walked home and back.  There   
 were no school dinners.               
  In the morning they started school   
 with assembly like us. For morning    
 break the played outside in the       
 street. Sometimes a horse and cart    
 passed but no cars.  The small        
 children wrote on slates.  The big    
 ones used to read from the Bible and  
 history books. They sang songs about  
 the Empire. The school trip meant     
 walking to the railway station. We go 
 by coach from school. The headmistress
 had a cane on her desk.               </content>
