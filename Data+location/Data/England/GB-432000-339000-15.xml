		<title>15DAY IN LIFE OF CATHERINE</title>
		<content> AT FOUR OR FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
 I LET MUFFIN IN THROUGH THE WINDOW IF 
 HE IS NOT ALREADY ON MY BED. AT SIX   
 O'CLOCK I AM ALLOWED TO PRACTISE MY   
 INSTRUMENT SO I PRACTISE THE PIANO.   
 WHEN I HAVE DONE ALL MY PIECES AND    
 WORKED THROUGH MY SCALE BOOK I GET    
 DRESSED. IF MUM AND DAD ARE STILL     
 ASLEEP I DO SOME THEORY AND FEED      
 MUFFIN.BY THAT TIME THEY ARE BOUND TO 
 BE AWAKE. WE HAVE OUR BREAKFAST. IF   
 IT'S WARM WE HAVE IT OUTSIDE ON THE   
 BALCONY. IF THERE IS STILL TIME TO    
 PRACTISE THE OBOE I PRACTISE IT, IF   
 NOT I PRACTISE IT AFTER SCHOOL. THEN I
 GO TO SCHOOL. AFTER SCHOOL I HAVE A   
 SNACK BEFORE GOING TO OBOE AND PIANO  
 THE ROOM I PLAY THE OBOE IN IS REALLY 
 NICE FOR PLAYING THE OBOE. MRS SIMMS  
 TEACHES ME THE OBOE.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
