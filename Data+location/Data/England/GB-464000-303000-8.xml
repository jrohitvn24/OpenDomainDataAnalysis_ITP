		<content> Most of the houses in our area        
 are less than 30 years old,but some   
 cottages in the villages are hundreds 
 of years old. The oldest buildings are
 the churches dating back to the 13th  
 century. Most people live in semi-    
 detached or detached houses,but there 
 are some modern bungalows and old     
 folks bungalows.There are two homes   
 for old folk .There are no high rise  
 flats at all,but a few maisonettes.The
 Thurnby Lodge Estate was built by     
 Leicester City Council about 30 years 
 ago and private buiders have been     
 building other estates since.The      
 latest development started this year  
 will provide another 180 homes.For the
 past few years tenants have been able 
 to buy their council houses and many  
 have done so.
