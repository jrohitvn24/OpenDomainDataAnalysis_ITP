		<content>  Mr.Jackson gets up at 6.30am and     
feeds the animals.Then he has his      
breakfast and then goes back to his    
farm and does the rest of the work.He  
has to tell the men what to do.Then he 
gives the cows their breakfast food and
drives the tractor around the field.   
When he comes back from the field      
he does some more work on the farm.If  
the food runs out he would have to go  
and buy some more food for the         
animals.Then he would have to drive    
the tractor into the garage and        
then have a talk with the men they     
could be having problems mending the   
tractor.Mr.Jackson said the jobs have  
got to be finished.
