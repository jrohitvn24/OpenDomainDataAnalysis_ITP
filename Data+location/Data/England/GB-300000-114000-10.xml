		<title>10MIDLAND SCHOOL BANK cont.</title>
		<content> The Midland Bank gave the School a    
 donation of Â£100 which was in         
 appreciation of the school opening    
 the bank, the first such operation in 
 the Tiverton area. With the Â£100 the  
 school purchased a printer for the BBC
 Micro.                                
 On the first day of opening nearly    
 Â£200 was deposited by the children for
 either a Griffin Saver Account or the 
 ordinary School Bank Account. Those   
 with Griffin Saver Accounts received  
 extra interest and a sports bag with  
 various useful items, while the School
 Bank Savers received a maths set, for 
 use in school, and a Bank Account file
 .
