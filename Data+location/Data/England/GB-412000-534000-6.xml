		<title>06Life on the West Road.</title>
		<content> On West Road there are a few          
 swings.Beside the swings is a         
 demolished area which used to be the  
 Pickford and Holland factory.         
 My street is called Lax Terrace,if you
 go further up you come to Hartside    
 school where I sometimes go to attend 
 the disco.                            
 At the bottom of my street there are  
 some agricultural merchants who sell  
 wheat and pet food.                   
 Across the road there is a garage and 
 Norvite Kitchens which appears to be  
 closed most of the time.              
 Next to my house is a field where we  
 all play games.                       
 In my house there are three downstairs
 rooms and four upstairs rooms,so we   
 have a bedroom each.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
