		<title>14BISHOP(CARLISLE): DAILY WORK</title>
		<content>   The Bishop's day begins at about 7am
 when he gets up. He then goes to the  
 chapel in the castle to say his       
 prayers. At 9am he is available to see
 people and arrange interviews. He then
 opens his mail and answers all the    
 letters that need answering. His      
 morning, then, is usually routine.    
   The afternoon is often taken up     
 with community meetings or interviews 
 that last until 5.30pm. At 7.30pm     
 most evenings there is a confirmation 
 service somewhere in the district. He 
 normally finishes work by 9pm.        
   Travel is an important feature of   
 his life. He travels widely throughout
 Cumbria and goes to London once       
 a week to attend the House of Lords.  
   Future vicars often stay at Rose    
 Castle just before they are ordained  
 by the Bishop.
