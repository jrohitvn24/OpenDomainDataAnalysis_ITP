		<title>01Gazetteer  _ Dunnington</title>
		<content>   Our area,east of{York,}in the       
 county of North Yorkshire, is mainly  
 flat, with good farming conditions.   
 Dunnington, the main village, is five 
 miles from York.{Murton}is a smaller  
 village,and nearer York,just East of  
 the York by-pass. The Anglo-Saxons    
 first settled here on a ridge of      
 debris left by an Ice Age glacier.    
    Dunnington has doubled its size in 
 the last fifteen years but has not yet
 become a suburb of York.People are    
 attracted to Dunnington because it is 
 fairly lively and no main roads run   
 through it.                           
    Now it is a commuter village       
 handily placed near York with the     
 York-Bridlington Road on the North and
 the Hull Road a mile away to the      
 south. Dunnington is in the fork of   
 the two which separate where they     
 pass over the York by-pass.           </content>
