		<title>01LANDSCAPE AND POPULATION</title>
		<content>  This area is dominated by the hills  
 of{Trink,Trencrom}and{Trendrine.}It is
 very rural having a low population    
 centred mainly on the three villages  
 of{Halsetown,Nancledra}and{Towednack. 
{ }The area changed gradually during   
 the last ten years because of         
{Government subsidies}to hill farmers. 
 As a result traditional moorland areas
 have been ploughed up and the ground  
 has been fertilised to produce        
 intensively managed grassland.Most of 
 the farming is dairy but there is a   
 move towards more diversification of  
 crops.                                
  There has been an{increase of        
{population}in the area and some of    
 these people have been accommodated in
 buildings which had a former          
 use.Piggeries,stables and farm        
 buildings have been converted into    
 very attractive dwellings.            </content>
