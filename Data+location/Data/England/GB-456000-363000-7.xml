		<title>07The Spa Ponds</title>
		<content>  During the last two years unemployed 
 adults on one year training schemes   
 have been working to improve the area 
 of the Spa ponds which had become     
 dirty and neglected.                  
  The ponds many years ago had been    
 stocked with trout and carp,and were  
 close to{Beeston Lodge,}a large old   
 gatehouse which no longer exists.     
  Two new ponds have been made with    
 islands in the middle to attract wild 
 life.Fifteen different kinds of       
 dragonflies have come over from the   
 nearby marshes,to the ponds.Trees have
 been planted,mainly oak and willow.   
  Unfortunately the area is constantly 
 being spoiled by{vandalism.}Trees have
 been uprooted and water iris have been
 removed to decorate people's own      
 garden ponds.A pair of{swans}decided  
 to nest there last year(1984) but were
 shot at by youths with pellet guns.   </content>
