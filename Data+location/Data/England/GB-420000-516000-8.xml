		<title>08ULNABY HALL FARM</title>
		<content> Ulnaby Hall is a farm of four hundred 
 acres, situated to the south of       
 Walworth at grid reference 226173, at 
 the junction of the B6279 and the road
 leading to Walworth,approximately one 
 mile to the north.                    
 The farm's buildings are situated     
 adjacent to the site of the{deserted  
{village}of Ulnaby. All that can be    
 seen of this formerly sizeable        
 settlement today are a series of grass
 covered hummocks, now grazed by       
 cattle.This can be contrasted with the
 nearby village of Walworth, which was 
 merely reduced in size, not totally   
 deserted during population            
 contractions of the thirteenth and    
 fourteenth centuries.                 
 The farm is held by a group of        
{trustees,}as are four other local     
 farms.                                
                                       </content>
