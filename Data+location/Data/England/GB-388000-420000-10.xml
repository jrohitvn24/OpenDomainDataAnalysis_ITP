		<content>   St. John with St. Michael School was
 opened in 1971 as a replacement school
 for St. Michael's (Shawforth) and St. 
 John's (Facit). In 1971 there were 120
 pupils on roll, but, in common with   
 virtually all schools in England in   
 1985 numbers have fallen, to 76 at    
 present, in spite of this being the   
 only school in Shawforth.             
   The open setting of the school,     
 however, encourages local animals to  
 regularly boost numbers on roll!      
 Farmers' goats, cows, sheep, chickens,
 horses and ducks are part of the scene
 and are accepted by all.              
   On Sundays the school is used as a  
 church (St. Michael's Mission).       
   Although Shawforth is in many ways  
 steeped in the past, modern technology
 has infiltrated the school which owns 
 a Teletext television, video recorder,
 BBC computer, printer &amp; photo copier. </content>
