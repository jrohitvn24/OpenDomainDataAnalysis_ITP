		<title>19Bramdean Village Hall</title>
		<content>  The village hall was built in 1965   
 with money raised by villagers and a  
 grant from the Ministry of Education. 
 It was built on the site of the old   
 village school.  It is let for private
 functions and also used for national  
 and local elections, foot clinic and  
 village clubs, e.g. youth club,       
 Women's Institute, Bramdean Society,  
 over 60's club and bingo.  It is used 
 by the church for the harvest supper  
 and various fundraising events, as    
 there is no separate church hall.  It 
 is run by a committee consisting not  
 only of the trustees but also         
 representatives of every organisation 
 which uses the hall on a regular      
 basis.  It is run as a charity, with  
 rents for use, and various fundraising
 events such as discos, barbecues and  
 car boot sales held each year,        
 providing income for the upkeep.      </content>
