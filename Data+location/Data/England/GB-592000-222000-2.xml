		<content>     The environment in our school area
 has changed a great deal.All the      
 farmland has been sold and new houses 
 built on the land.The new houses have 
 smaller gardens than the old ones,    
 with walls surrounding them.Birdlife  
 has changed since all the{hedgerows}  
 went.Foxes are still seen but have to 
 travel further to find prey.          
    Much of the life of the village is 
 centred round the{schools}the other   
 main centre is Villa Road where we    
 have the{village hall},in which the   
{Playgroup},{the baby clinic}and       
 various organisations meet, the       
{commuinity centre}(which is new and   
 not often used at the moment).{The    
{library}and the {Scout Headquarters}  
 are important.
