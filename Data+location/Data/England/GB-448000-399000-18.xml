		<title>18Transport Mexborough/Denaby</title>
		<content> Denaby/Mexborough is well situated for
 rail,{canal}and road{communications,} 
 and the nearest airport is one hour   
 away at Manchester. Airports are used 
 mainly for holiday travel.{Coal}      
 produced in Cadeby pit can be moved   
 quickly by road,rail or barge very    
 easily to any area of Britain or      
 Europe.Perishable food can be brought 
 here by rail or the motorway from the 
 ports. It would take a matter of days 
 on a barge but by road it would only  
 take a couple of hours.Even London is 
 only two hours away by high speed     
 train. Local{transport}by bus is very 
 cheap. We need cheap transport for    
 people going to work, school and      
 shopping but rates as a consequence   
 are higher. If you are travelling over
 three miles on a school journey the   
 council usually give you a bus pass   
 providing you are under sixteen.      </content>
