		<title>05Warwick Crown Court.</title>
		<content> Justice has been dispensed in Warwick 
 since the 15th Century and in a       
 building called Shire Hall since      
 1571.This early building was replaced 
 in 1676 and again in 1758 when the    
 earlier building became inadequate.A  
 bodyguard for the Judges was provided 
 by the sheriffs but in 1890 the       
 police took over this duty.We have    
 looked at the duties of one Court     
 official, an usher.The usher's duty   
 is to assist as much as possible      
 all people attending court especially 
 jurors and witnesses and to           
 contribute to the smooth running of   
 the court. They obtain the names of   
 barristers engaged in the trials,     
 escort the Judges to and from the     
 courts, administer oaths to witness   
 and to police officers and ensure     
 that neccessary stationery is supplied
 to the jury, and others..             </content>
