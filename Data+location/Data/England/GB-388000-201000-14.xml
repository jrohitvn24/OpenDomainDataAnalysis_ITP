 The church nearest to our school is a 
 Methodist Chapel.It is attached to a  
 hall which is used by the Boys'       
 Brigade and the Girls' Brigade.The    
 Silver Band practise there too.       
   France Lynch Parish Church is also  
 quite close and has a hall a short way
 away.This is used as a Sunday school  
 and is also used for the youngest     
 children of the village as a          
 play-school.                          
   The church on Coppice Hill is the   
 Baptist Tabernacle Church and they run
 a Saturday club which is like Sunday  
 School.                               
   Other Churches are in Bussage,      
 Oakridge and Christ Church,which is in
 Chalford valley.Most of the churches  
 are old and built of Cotswold stone.  
 Quite a few people attend the places  
 of worship in the area.               </content>
