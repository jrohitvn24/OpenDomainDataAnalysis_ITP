		<title>10  An Estate Village</title>
		<content> Yardley Hastings was an estate        
village,and provided farm-workers for  
the "Compton Estate",belonging to the  
Marquis of Northampton.Now that farming
is highly mechanised,it no longer      
requires the same level of manpower.   
As a consequence of this the character 
of the village has changed with many of
the houses being  sold off to people   
who commute to work outside the        
village. The old names of the village  
such as the Whitleys,Robinsons and     
Underwoods are disappearing,names which
have provided a sense of continuity    
with he past .Yardley Hastings used to 
contain almost all the different trades
to make it self sufficient. Today it   
can still boast to having its own      
builders,carpeners, decorators,        
plumbers, and a thriving Thatching     
business                               
                                       </content>
