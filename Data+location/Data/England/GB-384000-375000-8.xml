		<content> St Marys church is very old.The porch 
 and the nave were built in the        
 fourteenth century.Then the tower was 
 added in the sixteenth century.Finally
 the chancel was altered in 1855 by the
 Stanley family who lived at Alderley  
 Park.We have chosen three things which
 we found particularly interesting:    
 1. The stone tombs.They are           
 beautifully carved.One of the Lord    
 Stanleys has a dog at his feet and the
 other is holding a book.              
 2. Two special Bibles. One is called a
 "Vinegar Bible" because there is a    
 spelling mistake,it says "vinegar"    
 instead of "vineyard"The other is     
 called a "Breeches"bible.             
 3.The Stanley Pew. High up above the  
 nave the Stanley family sat away from 
 "the ordinary people"
