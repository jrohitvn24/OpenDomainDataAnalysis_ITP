		<title>19SHOPS IN HESSLE SQUARE</title>
		<content> Hessle Square is the main shopping    
 centre in this area. It has the       
 largest number of shops, including two
 supermarkets, two chemists, one       
 garage, one big newsagency, two public
 houses and one camera shop, plus many 
 other smaller shops. Hundreds of local
 people use the Square for their       
 routine shopping. On Saturdays,       
 particularly, it is very busy.        
 Recently, however, Prestongate has    
 been made into a "pedestrian only"    
 street. Some of the traders have been 
 objecting to this, saying the lack of 
 car-parking in the area is affecting  
 people's shopping habits. Certainly,  
 the opening of a large supermarket    
 (Sainsbury's) on the outskirts of the 
 village has attracted many local      
 shoppers, perhaps because of its own  
 large car-park and because the shop is
 well-stocked and attractive.          </content>
