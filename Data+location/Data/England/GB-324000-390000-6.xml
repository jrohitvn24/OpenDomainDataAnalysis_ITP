		<title>06    LEASOWE LIGHTHOUSE</title>
		<content>  Leasowe Lighthouse was completed in  
 1737 to guide ships safely into the   
 Port of Liverpool.                    
  It was built of brick on a foundation
 of cotton bales which prevented it    
 from sinking into the marshy land.    
  Being 101 feet high, the 'keeper had 
 to climb 130 steps each evening to    
 tend to his lights.                   
  Locals, called 'The Wreckers', used  
 to light fires on the sea-shore. This 
 confused the sailors into running     
 their ships aground where the cargo   
 was plundered.                        
  Recently the lighthouse has become   
 derelict since it was closed after the
 New Brighton lighthouse was built at  
 the entrance to the River Mersey.     
  However, the lighthouse may soon     
 become used again, as a developer     
 plans to convert the lighthouse into a
 public house.                         </content>
