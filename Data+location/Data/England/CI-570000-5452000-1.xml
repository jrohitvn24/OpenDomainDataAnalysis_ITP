		<content>    This, the north-eastern corner of  
 Jersey, is largely unknown by the     
 hordes of tourists who annually invade
 the Island, except for the breakwater 
 at{St. Catherine's Bay,}part of a     
 grand naval harbour which was never   
 completed.                            
                                       
    The coastline of cliffs indented   
 with small rocky bays is largely made 
 up of{Rozel Conglomerate,}a           
 sedimentary rock full of pebbles,     
 which was formed by deposition from   
 flash floods in a mountainous desert. 
                                       
    Inland the area is wholly devoted  
 to farming, both dairy and arable. The
 whole lies in the{Parish of St.Martin,
 which also administers a reef of rocks
 known as{Les Ecrehous,}about three    
 miles to the north-east, on which is a
 small cluster of fishermen's huts.    </content>
