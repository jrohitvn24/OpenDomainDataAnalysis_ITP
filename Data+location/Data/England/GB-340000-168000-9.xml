 Mrs. Hilda Baker,who is a local       
{councillor,}came to talk to us about  
 the {history and future development}of
 Clevedon. She told what her life had  
 been like. She came to Clevedon at the
 age of 17 as a member of the Land     
 Army. She was paid fifteen shillings a
 week by Farmer Marshall, for whom she 
 worked. 15 shillings is equal to 75p. 
 She had to milk cows by hand and      
 generally help on the farm. She told  
 us that the site on which our school, 
 Yeo Moor, stands had once been        
 Tutton's Farm. Mrs. Baker left some   
 deeds with us, dating back to the 15th
 century. We found out that some of the
 new roads in Clevedon are named after 
 important people who used to live     
 here. She also told us that the {     
{Triangle}is going to be developed into
 a{pedestrian precinct.}               </content>
