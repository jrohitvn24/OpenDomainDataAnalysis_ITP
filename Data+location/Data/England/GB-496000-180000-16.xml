		<title>16SALT HILL PARK, SLOUGH</title>
		<content>    Salt Hill Park was made on land    
 donated to Slough by James Elliman,   
 one of our first industrialists, in   
 1906. It was then on the edge of      
 Slough!  All sorts of people use the  
 park - children play after school and 
 tackle the assault course while       
 mothers take small children during the
 quieter daytimes.                     
    People walk their dogs, go jogging 
 or play team games.  Organised sports 
 include football, cricket, tennis and 
 bowls and there is a lot of open space
 and planted park areas. Most people   
 enjoy the park but some felt that the 
 trains on one side and the Bath Road  
 on the other spoil it.                
    One or two uncared for areas with  
 nettles and rubbish don't look very   
 nice.  It would be better to have mats
 under the swings and slides and a     
 first aid post.                       </content>
