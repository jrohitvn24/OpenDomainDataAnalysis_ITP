 The area is famous for its connection 
 with the Pendle Witches.In l6l2 two   
 families, the Demdikes and the        
 Chattox, were tried at Lancaster      
 Assizes and six people were eventually
 hanged for witchcraft. Alice Nutter,  
 also tried but found not guilty, is   
 buried in St. Mary's Churchyard,      
 Newchurch.The Eye of God in the tower 
 of this Church is meant to ward off   
 evil spirits. On Hallow'een people    
 visit the area because of its         
 connection with the witches. On Good  
 Friday l652 George Fox had a vision on
 Pendle Hill which led to the founding 
 of the Quaker Movement and it is now  
 the custom to walk to the top of      
 Pendle Hill on this day. For over 20  
 years a local family have held a      
 Garden Party at their home to raise   
 funds for St. Mary's Church.          </content>
