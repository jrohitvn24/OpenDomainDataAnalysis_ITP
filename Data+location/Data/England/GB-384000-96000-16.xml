		<content>      Winterborne Kingston Cricket Club
 was re-formed in 1950 after the war   
 years. For a long time all the players
 lived in the village,but now that the 
 population pattern has changed,men    
 from many parts of Dorset play in the 
 team,because of connections with the  
 village.                              
      The team is now in Division One  
 of The Dorset Cricket Association     
 League.                               
      A committee,under the            
 chairmanship of Alan Wellstead,one of 
 the original founders of the team,    
 control the activities of the club.The
 team captain is Peter Gale,who also   
 takes care of the wicket and the rest 
 of the ground.                        
       The cricket club also runs a    
 very successful social club open to   
 all residents in the area and         
 providing many forms of entertainment.</content>
