		<content>  This block consists of high, chalk   
 downland in North Berkshire.          
  The land is mainly in the ownership  
 of large estates, and is intensively  
 farmed.                               
  It is designated as an area of out-  
 Standing Natural Beauty.              
  It is bounded on the South by the M4 
 motorway.                             
  The villages of Yattendon and        
 Hampstead Norreys are both small and  
 have few public amenities.            
  The latter is slowly changing its    
 character as outsiders move in.       
  Yattendon, being largely in estate   
 ownership has resisted change.
