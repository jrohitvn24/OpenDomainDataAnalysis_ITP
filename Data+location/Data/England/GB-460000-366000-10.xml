 for Samantha and me(Beverley) to visit
{The Edwinstowe Nursing Home for the   
{Elderly}at 2.00pm on Wednesday the 3rd
 July.We found the guests sitting      
 outside in very hot weather after     
 finishing their dinner.Mrs.Cannon who 
 was in charge introduced us to guests 
 and nurses.The oldest guest was{93}and
 the youngest{62.}                     
     Although it looked large on the   
 outside it was quite small on the     
 inside and only caters for{25 guests  
 at any one time.                      
     In the past it was called{Field   
{House}and belonged to the{National    
{Coal Board.}Built originally by a     
 private coal company it was used as a 
 manager's house. Having been          
 nationalised it is now privatised and 
 not part of the National Health       
 Service but still helps the elderly.  </content>
