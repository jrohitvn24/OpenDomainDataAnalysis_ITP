 New Costessey started developing      
 between the two World Wars.  People   
 came as squatters, and between the    
 more modern replacement bungalows and 
 houses you can still see an occasional
 wooden shack, or even a converted     
 railway carriage.  A lot of more      
 orderly development has taken place   
 since the Second World War.           
                                       
 Recently, a large modern council      
 housing scheme has replaced land      
 formerly covered with 'prefabs'       
 erected as 'temporary' housing in the 
 late 1940s.  A little more land will  
 become available when some            
 structurally unsound 'Airey' houses   
 are demolished.                       
                                       
                                       </content>
