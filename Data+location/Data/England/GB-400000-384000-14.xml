		<content> In New Mills there is a police station
 near the library on Hall Street.      
 Outside it shows posters of people who
 are wanted for crimes. There is a     
 public telephone on the wall for      
 anybody to use. If you lose something 
 the best place to go is the police    
 station. There is a traffic warden in 
 New Mills and if you park on double   
 yellow lines you have to pay a fine.  
 Vandalism is not to bad in New Mills  
 but there is some. Bus stations and   
 bus stops are the worst for vandalism.
 Having a manned police station helps  
 deter hooligans.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
