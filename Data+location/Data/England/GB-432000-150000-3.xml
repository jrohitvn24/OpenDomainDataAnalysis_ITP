		<content> St. Thomas of Canterbury Church       
 Tangley is thought to be on the site  
 of a very ancient place of worship    
 going back to prehistoric times, owing
 to the presence of three{Sarsen Stones
 in the church yard. These stones are  
 similar to those found at Stonehenge. 
 The church was built in about the  5th
 Century and rebuilt in 1875, the tower
 and spire being completed in 1898. The
 apse was re-errected on the site of   
 the old foundations.The tub-shaped    
 font is remarkable and rare, being    
 16th or 17th Century lead. The windows
 at the East End of the church are     
 Saxon  type as are those in the       
 chancel arch which itself is probably 
 Saxon. There is a peal of five bells  
 and also a tolling bell cast by John  
 Tonne in 1522.
