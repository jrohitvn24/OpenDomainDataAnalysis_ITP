		<title>06RELIGION IN CHERINGTON</title>
		<content> At a time of changing attitudes to    
 established religious institutions, it
 was decided to record the affiliations
 and allegiances of children aged 5 to 
 11 in the Minchinhampton, Cherington  
 and Avening areas.  Exactly one third 
 said they attended a place of worship 
 regularly each Sunday.  Just over one 
 third never attend church and the     
 remainder go just occasionally.  When 
 asked which place of worship they     
 would attend if indeed they were to   
 go, 75% named the Anglcan Church, with
 just under 25% preferring the Baptist 
 Chapel. Clearly a wide choice was     
 not available to worshippers, though  
 one family recorded adherence to the  
 Society of Friends, one to the        
 Salvation Army and one to "Chapel".   
 No-one questioned went to the nearby  
 Catholic church.  Only 1 child in 4   
 attended Sunday School.               </content>
