		<title>12ATTITUDES IN KENDAL</title>
		<content>  This block is part of the old county 
 of{Westmorland}which still exists in  
 people's minds, if not on the map. The
 area continues to show{stability,}if  
 not great riches, and its hardy       
 citizens survive depressions both in  
 weather and{employment}with typical   
 Northern disregard for circumstances  
 and events outside their immediate    
 compass. Kendalians are, however, no  
 longer either as isolated or self-    
 sufficient as previously, since the   
{motorway}brings both tourists and     
 vandals from the cities and the{Common
{Market}brings both development grants 
 and farming restrictions.{The average 
{Kendalian}has a strong sense of how to
 live well even though{religious commi-
{tment}has waned with the rise of other
 entertainments and activities. A small
 survey showed that less than a 1/4 of 
 young people feel any Christian faith.</content>
