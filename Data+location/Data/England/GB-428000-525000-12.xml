		<content>****************                       
At 7:00am I got washed and went        
downstairs to read a computer magazine 
"Crash". Next I had breakfast, Weetabix
, toast and coffee, then it was out to 
catch the school bus from the Village  
Green.                                 
  There we played football until the   
bell rang, then we went to our tutor   
rooms for registration. We played      
cricket in our Physical Education      
lesson, next we had Maths where we     
were learning ??????????.              
  Lunch was two sandwiches, a drink, a 
biscuit and an apple. We then played   
football until the afternoon school    
began. We had Chemistry and were       
learning the elements, then in French  
we learnt how to buy French food. This 
brought us to 3:30pm, home on the bus  
and home for tea, an more football     
until bedtime at 9:30pm.               </content>
