		<title>05"MY CHILDHOOD IN ST.IVES."</title>
		<content> An excerpt from an{interview}with an  
 old St.Ives resident.                 
                                       
  "As a child I lived on the{Island,}in
 the house which was then called "The  
 Battery" because of the First World   
 War gun emplacements outside.It had a 
 large kitchen and two bedrooms,all on 
 one floor with very high ceilings.We  
 had no electric or gas and cooked on a
 big Valor paraffin stove.We used      
 paraffin lamps and we also had a large
 Cornish range for heating and cooking.
 My mother ironed with an iron heated  
 on the stove.                         
  My father worked in Penlee Quarry,   
 Newlyn.He walked or cycled to work.He 
 was also unemployed for short periods.
 He then worked as a shotfirer when    
 they blasted down through the Warren  
 to put the new sewers in."
