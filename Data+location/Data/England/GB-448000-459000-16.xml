		<title>16Newton-on-Ouse Feast.</title>
		<content> In the nineteenth century Newton Feast
 was a two-day holiday held at         
 Whitsuntide.All the villagers were    
 involved and the"River King"sailed up 
 the River Ouse bringing more people.  
 Events included a pipe-smoking        
 competition,Punch and Judy show,swing 
 boats and coconut shies.              
    The annual feast died out in the   
 1930s but started again in 1980.At the
 modern feast,held in June,there is a  
 raft race on the river,fancy dress and
 fishing competitions,an ox-roast on   
 the village green and other popular   
 attractions.Stalls,with goods to sell 
 and games of skill and chance,line the
 village street.In the evening a barn  
 dance is held at White House Farm.    
   Money raised at the feast goes to   
 village charities and organisations.
