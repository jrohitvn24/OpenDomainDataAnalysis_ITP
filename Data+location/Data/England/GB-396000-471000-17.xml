		<title>17TREES IN KETTLEWELL</title>
		<content>   There are some fine specimens of    
 trees in the village, many attracting 
 amateur and professional artists.  On 
 the hillsides, if there is a          
 convenient wall, the ash grows well,  
 although in the open and on the       
 limestone screes it can be barked by  
 grazing sheep.  There is hazel,       
 bird-cherry and rowan, with scrubby   
 hawthorn on dry ground.  Evidence can 
 be found of earlier coppicing of      
 hazel, and recent conservation policy 
 is re-introducing woodland coppicing. 
   On the Knipe there is a section of  
 ancient woodland, with low growing    
 bushes, mainly hazel, but some oak and
 hawthorn, probably dating from the    
 Middle Ages.                          
   The National Park, working in       
 co-operation with local landowners    
 have planted several areas, mainly    
 near the screes, with specimen trees. </content>
