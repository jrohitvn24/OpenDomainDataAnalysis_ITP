		<title>18Witchampton Paper Board Mill</title>
		<content> The Mill is on the site of one of the 
 two flour mills mentioned in the      
 Domesday Book. It has been producing  
 paper since the early 1700's. In the  
 early days it was solely operated by  
 water power but automation has now    
 almost taken over. The very early     
 products were made from rope and hemp 
 all being air dried, then wood pulp   
 was introduced and cartridge paper    
 was manufactured.Modern day products  
 include 'Cotacard', paperback book    
 covers, record sleeves, labels for    
 Marks and Spencers and soap wrappers. 
 The mill is now run as a co_operative 
 with Wimborne Council. It employs 50  
 people of whom very few are actually  
 local residents.The siting of the mill
 has resulted in a large number of     
 heavy lorries passing through the     
 village. Other than farming the mill  
 is the only local industry.           </content>
