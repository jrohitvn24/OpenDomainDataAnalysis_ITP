		<title>12Life on an Eastchurch Farm</title>
		<content>     My{home life}is on Connetts{farm  
 with my parents, an older sister and a
 younger brother. I live some distance 
 from other children in Eastchurch     
{village.                              
     I help my dad at weekends with    
 feeding the cows and looking after the
 crops.                                
     In one field, next to the caravan 
 park, people climb over and break the 
 wire on the fence. I help to tie this 
 up but it has to be done frequently as
 these people return, sometimes with   
 wire cutters.                         
     Recently a Jack Russell Terrier   
 got in among our{sheep}and two days   
 later we found a dead lamb.           
     During the lambing season, if I   
 get up early enough, I help feed the  
 sheep and lambs. The snows of 1985    
 made it hard for us and we lost five  
 lambs.                                </content>
