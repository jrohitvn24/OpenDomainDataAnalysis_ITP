		<content>    A large proportion of All Saints'  
 Church was built in the nine hundreds 
 and it is one of the countries best   
 preserved Saxon churches. The first   
 recorded vicar was in 1210. The church
 belongs to the Oxford diocese and four
 weekly services are held. There are   
 various activities held at the church,
 such as a Sunday School, a youth club 
 and flower shows. Underneath the      
 church is a 7th century crypt, which  
 is said to have contained the bones of
 a saint. The church has had several   
 alterations to its structure in 1649, 
 1669 and 1657. Inside the tower are   
 six bells which are in regular use.
