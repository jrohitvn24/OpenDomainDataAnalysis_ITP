		<title>05New Milton Survey</title>
		<content>                                       
 As part of our Domesday Project work  
 we carried out a survey of people's   
 attitudes towards{New Milton.}We found
 that most people liked living in the  
 area and would recommend it to other  
 people.However,some found{New Milton} 
 too busy and said that there were too 
 many elderly people.Most people we    
 spoke to thought that{New Milton}was  
 big enough and disliked the idea of   
 more building in the area.Nearly      
 eveyone we spoke to was satisfied with
 the range of shops in the area and    
 thought that the car parking provision
 was good.They thought that the area   
 was quite well served by amenities but
 that there were not enough amenities  
 providing entertainment,especially    
 for the young.Most people felt that   
 they should be more play facilities   
 for children.                         </content>
