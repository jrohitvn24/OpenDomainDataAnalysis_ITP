		<title>20CRAZIES HILL/WARGRAVE SURVEY</title>
		<content> This{Domesday Survey}has been carried 
 out by children aged 8 to 11 in the   
 Junior Class of{Crazies Hill CE       
{Primary School.}                      
 It was an exercise which employed     
 resources previously unavailable to   
 the children. A video camera was      
 borrowed to record interviews which   
 were then assessed, by the children,  
 for inclusion in the text pages.Local 
 people, parents and governors came    
 to school to talk with the children on
 a greater scale than usual, providing 
 a valuable link with the community.   
 The amenity count and some pages of   
 text were completed with assistance of
 secondary pupils from{The Piggott     
{School, Wargrave.}Crazies Hill        
 children, in particular, used the     
 computer for data handling while the  
 Piggott children concentrated on its  
 use as a word processor.              </content>
