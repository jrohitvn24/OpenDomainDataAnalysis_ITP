		<content> This area of Ramsgate and Broadstairs 
 is a mixture of seaside,light         
 industry,farmland and areas of old    
 and modern housing(council and        
 private) with many busy shopping      
 streets.The decline of the holiday    
 trade(at its peak during the Victorian
 era) and the closure of Ramsgate civil
 airport(now a school,housing and      
 industrial estate) have led to the    
 growth of light manufacturing on 2    
 well defined industrial estates.Arable
 land bordering the area produces      
 mostly root vegetables and brassicas. 
 One cinema,a casino,nightclubs and    
 amusement arcades are the main        
 entertainments in Ramsgate whilst     
 Broadstairs boasts a more leisurely   
 atmosphere for the mainly retired     
 population.Broadstairs offers largely 
 private housing and has a number of   
 buildings of historic interest.       </content>
