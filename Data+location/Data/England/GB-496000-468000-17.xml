		<title>17 Dialect in Weaverthorpe</title>
		<content>   The dialect is a version of the old 
{East Riding dialect.}The village men  
 often use it among themselves. Some of
 the{old words}are still in{common}    
{usage}:- throng for busy, larking for 
 playing, stoggie for wood pigeon,     
 spuggie for sparrow, cleg for horse-  
 fly, leg for throw, manishment for    
 feriliser, weea for where and wer (as 
 in where) for who.                    
   Instead of "Good morning" etc., the 
 local greeting, used mainly by men and
 boys, is "Now then".                  
  {A few old customs survive:}women    
 still give a new baby money at the    
 first meeting, the church gates into  
 the lych-gate are tied up during a    
 wedding and money must be thrown to   
 the children before they are opened,  
 and the family mourners attend church 
 the first Sunday after the funeral.
