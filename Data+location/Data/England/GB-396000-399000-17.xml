		<title>17BUCTON CASTLE &amp; ROMAN ROADS</title>
		<content>                                       
     High on the eastern hills         
 overlooking the River Tame is Bucton. 
 Here are the remains of an early      
 encampment. Although generally        
 described as a Roman Castle; because  
 of its oval shape,its origins are more
 likely to be early British, probably  
 used by sun-worshippers. The          
 traditional rectangular Roman camp    
 shape is missing, although Romans     
 definitely occupied the site, taking  
 advantage both of its strategic       
 position, and its approximate midpoint
 between their camps at{Melandra}near  
 Glossop, and{Castleshaw}above Delph.  
 The site commands views over the south
 part of Lancashire, the greater part  
 of Cheshire, and some considerable    
 distance over the Yorkshire moorlands.
