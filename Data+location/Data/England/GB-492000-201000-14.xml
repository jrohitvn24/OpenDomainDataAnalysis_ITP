		<content>  At Chartridge School we have quite   
good sports equipment and get involved 
in many leagues, such as football and  
netball through the school.We also     
have a Table-tennis league for boys and
girls.                                 
  We have a large sports field.At the  
end of the summer term we have a sports
day.In Chesham there are quite a few   
sports schemes recently new tennis     
courts,new 5 aside football and        
basketball pitches have been made.     
  At Chartridge most boys prefer       
football as thier best sport and most  
girls like table tennis.17 out of 34   
people in our class belong to an       
association to do with sport.Chesham   
United F.C. burnt down and has just    
been rebuilt.Also England football     
teams have been banned from European   
tournaments by U.E.F.A. and F.I.F.A..
