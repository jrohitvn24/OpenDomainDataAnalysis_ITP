		<title>17SHIPTON QUARRY</title>
		<content>  The quarry and cement works are both 
owned by Blue Circle. The quarry has   
an area of 27 acres and is 60 feet     
deep, they quarry limestone and clay   
which makes an almost perfect mix for  
cement.                                
 The works employ 103 persons          
including millers, chemists, instrument
engineers and other jobs,but in 1975   
they had 300 jobs and produced 3 times 
as much.  In 1984 they payed 12,000,000
pounds in redundancy money. The quarry 
produces 360-400 tons a day, which goes
to large companies such as Redland     
Roof Tiles. The factory was built      
in 1929 and  unfortunately they are    
still using a lot of 1920's technology.
They may close down because of bills,  
they pay for coal (22,000tons), gypsum 
(8,000tons) and 15,500,000 units of    
electrity. They work from 12pm-6am     
to get cheap rate power.               </content>
