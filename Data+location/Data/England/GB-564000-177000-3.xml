   At the top of Chadwell Hill stands  
 the crossroads with the church at one 
 corner and a modern library made of   
 wood,brick and much glass at the      
 opposite corner.Across the road is{The
{Crosskeys}:a public house which has   
 become a local landmark and gives its 
 name to the crossroads;and on the     
 final corner stands {Sleepers Farm},a 
 cottage with a thatched roof which was
 built for Daniel{Defoe.               
  The rest of Chadwell is a mix of     
 different{housing.}Among the rather   
 dowdy older properties are two tower  
 blocks of flats,many late 50's council
 houses in good repair,and some modern 
 town houses.There is one              
 weirdly-shaped building: it looks     
 roughly hexagonal.There is also a     
 cemetery serving both Chadwell        
 and Tilbury.                          </content>
