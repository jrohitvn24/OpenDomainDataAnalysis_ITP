		<content> On Thursdays I go to gymnastics at    
 Chequers Gym.When I get home from     
 school I put on my tracksuit and Mummy
 takes me to the gym.We get the        
 apparatus out and do tumble           
 runs,rolls,cartwheels,backward rolls  
 and then with the springboard we do   
 stretch jumps.We enter competitions   
 and we practise hard because we want  
 to win but I haven't won yet.On       
 Fridays at 6.30 I go to Beavers.We do 
 many interesting things.We paint,cook 
 and play football.Sometimes we go out 
 for trips.We have been to the West    
 Midland Safari Park where we saw many 
 animals.Once we wrote to the Captain  
 of Beavers and he sent us a leaflet   
 with a picture of the ship            
 H.M.S.Beaver.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
