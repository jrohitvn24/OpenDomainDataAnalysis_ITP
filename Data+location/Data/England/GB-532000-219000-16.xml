		<title>16BUILDINGS: DANE END &amp; AREA</title>
		<content>{Dane End House}is the largest private 
 house in the area and was built in the
 19th Century. It was at one time the  
 home of{LORD GLADSTONE}but it has also
 been a residential school for foreign 
 students but it is now a private      
 dwelling.                             
 There are a number of timber faced    
 houses in the area and one of these in
 Dane End is called{'THE OLD MISSION   
{HOUSE'}and it used to be the chapel.  
{HUNT'S COTTAGE}was built in 1350 and  
 is probably the oldest house in the   
 area. It was originally a 'hall' house
 and inhabited by an important person. 
 It is thought that the family probably
 moved to{Lordship Farm}(just outside  
 the D-block) in 1650. At one time it  
 was converted into three houses but 30
 years ago it was converted into two.  
 The present owner is carrying out     
 restoration work.                     </content>
