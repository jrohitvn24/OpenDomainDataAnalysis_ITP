		<content> Most travellers stick to the few main 
 roads that cross the Pennines. But the
 seemingly impenetrable hills conceal a
 multitude of villages tucked away in  
 hidden green valleys, or clinging to  
 steep hillsides. The M57 leads on to  
 one such village, called Mottram. Once
 isolated communities, the inhabitants 
 of these villages leading into the    
 Pennines, retain the independent      
 spirit and dogged perserverance of the
 days when even a short journey was    
 hazardous. Mottram used to contain    
 only the traditional stone-built      
 cottages, typical of the area. The    
 heavy stone lintels, made of one      
 enormous piece of stone, were         
 characteristic. The local stone was   
 used for the Church, and for the      
 thirteenth century Old Hall, the      
 oldest remaining secular building,    
 which is now a fish and chip shop.    </content>
