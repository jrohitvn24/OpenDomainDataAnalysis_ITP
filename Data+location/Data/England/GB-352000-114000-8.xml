		<title>08Westland Helicopters Yeovil.</title>
		<content>    Westlands,one of Europe's leading  
 helicopter firms &amp; employing about    
 5500 people, is also a leader in      
 automated machine control.Helicopters 
 at present being built are the Sea    
 King ,the Lynx (Army &amp; Navy versions),
 the W 30 (a 17/22 seat civil airbus), 
 &amp; the EH 101 (due to fly in Dec '86). 
     The company is in something of a  
  crisis at present.An expected order  
 of 27 for the W 30 from the Indian    
 Govt,did not materialise following the
 assassination of Mrs Ghandi.          
     Financial difficulties have       
 followed with a take over bid being   
 made &amp; withdrawn, &amp; share prices down.
 The Company Chairman has resigned &amp;   
 been replaced,and a complete review of
 all activities is being undertaken by 
 top accountants Price Waterhouse.The  
 workforce,(&amp; Yeovil),is nervous with  
 rumours of perhaps 2000 redundancies. </content>
