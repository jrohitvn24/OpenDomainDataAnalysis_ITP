		<title>20The Village School</title>
		<content> The earliest records of the school    
 date back to 1846. In 1960 the school 
 was due to close under the development
 plan but was saved due to proposed    
 remodelling. By 1963 Witchampton      
 school had been refurbished and       
 extended. The teaching space had been 
 doubled and a new auxiliary block     
 including cloakrooms, an office and a 
 kitchen had been added. In November   
 1973 the three tier comprehensive     
 system was introduced and the school  
 became a first school. At the present 
 time there are 38 children on the roll
 this will rise to 47 in February 1986.
 There are two full time members of    
 staff and a part time teacher. In 1983
 the school was made into one open plan
 area with one class base at either end
 of the school with a central resource 
 area. The Head Teacher appointed in   
 1985 is Mrs Denise Whild.             </content>
