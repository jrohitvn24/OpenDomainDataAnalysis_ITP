{      -----------------------         
  Although our area does contain some  
 local industry,situated in Upper      
 Dovercourt,it is in it's nature       
 still mainly a rural and residential  
 environment.                          
  The landscape is one of gentle       
 slopes,and wide sweeping views across 
 the fields.In the distance can be seen
 the busy quay and refinery at         
 Parkeston.While across the river      
 Stour,the county of Suffolk lies      
 revealed.                             
  Twisting country lanes take you      
 through the linked villages of Little 
 and Great Oakley,leading to the small 
 village of Ramsey,which is dominated  
 by it's Windmill.                     
  The area has an interesting past,an  
 is well worth visiting,to catch a     
 flavour of the local history.         </content>
