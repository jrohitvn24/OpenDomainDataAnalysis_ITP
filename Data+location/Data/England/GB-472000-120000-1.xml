		<content> The area lies between the South Downs 
 and Queen Elizabeth Country Park to   
 the south and Petersfield to the north
{Ecology:}Primarily a farming region,  
 the countryside contains large numbers
 of small woods and copses of mainly   
 deciduous trees.  A network of        
 footpaths cover the area.             
{Transport:}The A3 London to Portsmouth
 road crosses the area from the cutting
 in Butser Hill north-east towards     
 Petersfield.  The London to Portsmouth
 railway line also crosses the area.   
{Population:}The main areas of         
 population are the southern outskirts 
 of Petersfield and the ancient village
 of Buriton, which is a conservation   
 area.                                 
{Landscape:}The Petersfield Heath with 
 its surrounding land and Buriton are  
 popular beauty spots.
