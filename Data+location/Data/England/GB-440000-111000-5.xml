    For children of our age the most   
 fashionable clothes shop is Top Shop. 
 They sell clothes made of crinkly     
 materials. The garments look as though
 they need ironing.  You can buy       
 ski-pants, jump-suits, roll-up        
 trousers, loose trousers and body     
 warmers.  You wear snoods around your 
 neck or on your head. Bat-wing jumpers
 are enormous and polo necks are coming
 back into fashion.  Rock and roll     
 dresses have stiff petticoats to make 
 them stand out. Some of the favourites
 for winter are leg warmers, luminous  
 socks and finger gloves. Colours for  
 the winter are black, grey, red and   
 bright colours. For the summer there  
 are mostly pastel shades.{
