		<title>10CUCKMANS FARM</title>
		<content>  The{farm}in Chiswell Green is called 
 Cuckmans Farm. It has been here for   
 roughly 1000 years and belongs to     
 Mr. Pope. He does all the work by     
 himself although he has about 300     
 acres. There used to be seven people  
 working on the farm but now there is  
 only Mr.Pope and a{Contract Labourer  
 for when he needs the help. Mr.Pope   
 used to grow peas and other vegetables
 but now he just grows barley and grain
 which is taken abroad. There aren't   
 any animals on the farm but there used
 to be some sheep,chickens and turkeys.
 He also used to have a dairy herd but 
 now he just has a few geese and two   
 large dogs to give warning of         
 intruders. The machines that Mr.Pope  
 uses are nearly all attachments to his
 tractor but he also has a combine     
 harvester which does the job of       
 several men.                          </content>
