		<content> There are several old and interesting 
 places to visit in our area, but      
 probably the most famous house in the{
{Shibden Valley}is Shibden Hall, in    
 Shibden Park. The park is just south  
 of Stump Cross on our map but the     
 house is shown on the area immediately
 south of ours. The Conservative Club  
 at{Northowram}was once the old Bell   
 School, which was the first school in 
 the area, over 200 years ago. The     
 original bell is still displayed in   
 the club. Several other interesting   
 houses, not open to the public        
 however, include Scout Hall, Upper    
 Shibden Hall, Lee House, and Dan      
 House. The Shibden Mill Inn is also   
 very interesting, and was the scene of
 a Luddite attack, the original mill   
 being burnt down in the early 19th    
 century.
