		<title>11SHOPPING IN NEWTOWN AREA</title>
		<content> The only shop in the area is also a   
 Post Office and Newsagency; it sells  
 groceries, greengroceries, coal and   
 advertsising space. It is one focal   
 point in the community. Newspapers    
 are delivered daily but in some parts 
 milk is every other day. The milkman  
 will also deliver bread, eggs and some
 other products. The butcher,fishmonger
 and baker do make calls  in some parts
 of the area. From a small survey it   
 seems that it is mainly the elderly   
 who make full use of the local shop   
 and their weekly grocery order is     
 delivered. The majority use it for    
 small items but do their weekly       
 shopping in supermarkets in Fareham   
 or Waterlooville. Clothes and durable 
 goods are mainly bought in the larger 
 towns, a few families use mail order  
 catalogues. Farm shops are very       
 popular for fresh food.               </content>
