		<content> The long awaited continuous footpath  
 through the village is now near       
 completion.Following another accident 
 at Merrington's crossroads,a 20 ton   
 lorry ended up in the P.C.Chairman's  
 peony bed.Felling of old,beautiful,   
 but sadly unsafe trees in the Beech   
 walk was the centre of much           
 controversy.Grants have been obtained 
 for tree planting in the Recreation   
 ground .The Square suffers from over  
 use particularly at weekends;schemes  
 being investigated to restrict parking
 The old station has been bought for   
 conversion into a home,causing        
 problems with access to old railway   
 line now designated a public          
 bridleway.Moles continue to make      
 occasional unwanted appearances in the
 cemetery.{Council}meets 1st Thursday  
 each month in Magistrates Court.New   
 plastic wheelie bins emptied Tuesdays </content>
