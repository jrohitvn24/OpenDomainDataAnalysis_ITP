		<title>11Occold School</title>
		<content>The school was built in 1879 on a patch
of land called Glebe belonging to the  
church.The school used to be a church  
school run by the church until it      
became a council school and then known 
as Occold County Primary School taken  
over by the East Suffolk County        
Council.If the land it stands on was   
not sold with the school it must be the
only piece of Glebe land left in the   
parish.An old school stood there before
this one was built but it was a big    
thatched building or perhaps an old    
house.120 children from Occold and     
Rishangles attended the school when it 
was first built. The school today is   
very different.Since then toilets have 
been installed,electric lighting has   
been put in,we have a TV,computer,sinks
drinking fountain and modern furniture.
