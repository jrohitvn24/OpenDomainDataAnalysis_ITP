		<title>07MY FAMILY</title>
		<content> There are four people in my family. My
 dad is a police man and my mum is a   
 secretary. My brother goes to the     
 secondary school and I am in the third
 year of junior school. We live in a   
 large three bedroomed detached        
 house.We have a kitchen, two living   
 rooms and a back garden. We have three
 T.V.s and a computer.                 
 My grandparents were in the war. My   
 uncle is tall and he has a wife and a 
 baby girl. They live about an hour    
 away. My mum and dad have a car each. 
 We go abroad every two years we go to 
 places like Corfu and Spain. The other
 years we stay in England. In my free  
 time I like playing on a computer.    
 Sometimes I go fishing with my dad or 
 brother, I like that a lot. I also    
 enjoy swimming and riding my BMX. My  
 family is very nice.
