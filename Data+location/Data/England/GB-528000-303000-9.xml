		<title>09Thorney Play Areas</title>
		<content>{  Thorney}has plenty of{play areas}but
 not enough{equipment.}We have 3 small 
{play areas}on the newest estate,      
{Chestnut Drive}and{The Maltings,}but  
 nothing on them. There is one{play    
{area}at the bottom of{Sandpit Road    
 with just 2 swings. Thorney has its   
 own park with 6 swings, 1 slide, and 1
 see-saw. For adults there are tennis  
 courts.{Thorney}children want more    
 equipment! I interviewed{Mr Hogg,}my  
 teacher.}He has joined the{'Thorney   
{Play Space Group'.}Other parents got  
 together in{April}to discuss the lack 
 of play areas. They decided that more 
 equipment was needed. They now have to
 discover what the rest of the village 
 think before exploring ways of raising
 money. Many children are at present   
 busy designing their own equipment,   
 and an{architect}is coming to a       
{coffee morning}to look at the designs.</content>
