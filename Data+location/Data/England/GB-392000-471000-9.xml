		<title>09ARNCLIFFE SCHOOL SPORTS</title>
		<content>   In the last week of the summer term 
 Arncliffe School holds a Sports day.  
 The sports are held on the school     
 field.  While the spectators are      
 mainly parents, friends and governors,
 visitors are welcomed too.  The sports
 include serious events like flat      
 races, skipping races, sack races,    
 bean bag races and a relay race.  Some
 races are purely for fun, such as     
 dressing up races, egg and spoon      
 races, parents' and teachers' events. 
   With the small number of children   
 involved, the races are usually       
 divided into heats for four age       
 ranges.                               
   The distance also varies according  
 to the age of the group, the longest  
 distance being three times round the  
 field past the septic tank!
