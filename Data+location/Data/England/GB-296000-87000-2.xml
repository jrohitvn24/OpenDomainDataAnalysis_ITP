		<title>02THE TOWN OF TOPSHAM</title>
		<content> Topsham is situated on the Exe        
 estuary, four miles from Exeter. Near 
 the river there are some Dutch style  
 houses, built of Dutch bricks which   
 were traded by merchants a long time  
 ago. In Fore Street, which runs       
 through the centre of Topsham you can 
 see some examples of Tudor buildings. 
 The road is very narrow making it     
 difficult for traffic to pass. It has 
 plenty of public houses for a small   
 town, providing welcome refreshment   
 for travellers. One of Topsham's most 
 modern attractions is a solar heated  
 open air swimming pool, which is run  
 by volunteers.
