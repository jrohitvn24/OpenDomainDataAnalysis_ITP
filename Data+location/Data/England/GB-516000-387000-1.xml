		<title>01SUMMARY OF 3 WOLDS VILLAGES</title>
		<content> Very rural area on Lincolnshire Wolds 
 _ attractive rolling countryside, 130m
 above sea level, rising from the plain
 &amp; comprising Wolds village of Ludford,
 hamlet of Sixhills on the edge &amp; North
 Willingham at the foot of the Wolds.  
 Population is approx: 389 and that of 
 Ludford is declining _ 311 in 1983,   
 380 in 1961 and 818 in 1861, due to   
 young people seeking work elsewhere as
 agricultural labour needs lessen with 
 mechanisation. Countryside mostly     
 arable farming, a little grazing and a
 few trees (many at Ludford removed for
 wartime airfield) so that artic winds 
 coming off the North Sea can make it a
 cold place in winter but it is an     
 attractive unspoilded area. It is bi_ 
 sected along its length by the A631   
 Mrket Rasen to Louth road.
