		<title>03ST AUBIN'S FORT</title>
		<content>  St. Aubin's Fort is a small walled   
 fortification 500 metres off shore    
 in St. Aubin's Bay. The first fort was
 built in 1542. In the beginning it    
 served to protect the harbour from    
 pirates, and in later years was       
 developed as part of the island       
 defences during the many Franco       
 English wars. Major alterations were  
 made in the 19th C. and during the    
 Occupation of Jersey, 1940-45, the    
 Germans added concrete bunkers and gun
 emplacements.                         
  Since then it has been used as a     
 field study centre for the island     
 schools.  A classroom has been built  
 within the walls, and the keep        
 converted to domestic quarters. It is 
 equipped with bottle gas, water       
 supplied by tanker, and a diesel      
 generator to supply electricity.
