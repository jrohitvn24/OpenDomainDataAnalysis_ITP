		<content> Shenley Farm incorporates a private   
 airfield with a grass runway, used    
 during the 1939-45 war as a forward   
 fighter base, now developed into a    
 complex with flying school, pleasure  
 flights, parachute club and landing   
 facilities for local businesses. A    
 comprehensive RAF war museum is on the
 site and the HQ of the local Air      
 Training Corps for teenage boys is    
 located here. At weekends the airfield
 is packed with visitors enjoying the  
 sights and sounds of the busy little  
 airfield. There have been complaints  
 from some local residents but all     
 activities are strictly controlled. On
 summer evenings the distinctive drone 
 of the parachute plane high in the sky
 makes one look up to see tiny dots    
 fall from the plane to become         
 billowing chutes carrying people      
 gently to earth.                      </content>
