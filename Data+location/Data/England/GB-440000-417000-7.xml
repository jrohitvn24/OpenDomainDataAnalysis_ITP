		<title>07LEISURE IN PURSTON JAGLIN</title>
		<content> Purston is extremely fortunate in     
 having a variety of man made and      
 natural leisure facilities. A council 
 owned sports centre was recently built
 next to the local high school. The    
 people who most commonly visit the    
 centre are predominantly aged between 
 eighteen and thirty. The activities   
 available range from paraplegic       
 basketball and keep fit to martial    
 arts.                                 
   Purston also has a large park which 
 offers a variety of activities        
 ranging from walking the dog, or      
 playing football, to bowls. Purston   
 also has a number of betting shops and
 public houses. One of the most popular
 hobbies amongst older people,         
 however, is gardening and the town has
 number of allotments catering for this
 interest.                             
                                       </content>
