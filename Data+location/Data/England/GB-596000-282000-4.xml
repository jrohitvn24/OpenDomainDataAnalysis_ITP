		<title>04FOREST AND FIELD</title>
		<content> Because a very large part of this area
 is covered with man-made forest, the  
 section given over to farming is not  
 extensive, and is located mainly in   
 the south and east.                   
 The fields, some of them belonging to 
 farms outside the area, are mostly    
 given over to arable crops - wheat,   
 beet, rape etc.                       
 A few sheep and cattle are grazed in  
 small areas and in the north western  
 section there is a large poultry farm.
