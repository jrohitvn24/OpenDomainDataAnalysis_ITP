		<content> Before the turn of the century        
 Thurnscoe was an{agricultural}village.
 Since, the main industry has been{coal
{mining.}There are a few other small,  
 light industries in the area but there
 have been no new industries in the    
 Thurnscoe area in recent years.       
 There is a purpose built{industrial   
{estate}in Thurnscoe but unfortunately 
 only a few factory units have been    
 used. There is a{sewing factory}at the
 East end of Thurnscoe. The Factory has
 been open for eight to nine years and 
 they make clothes for Marks and       
 Spencers. They also make clothes for  
 British Home Stores. There is a       
{printing factory}also called Finley   
 Swiffen and Co. The main thing it     
 prints is raffle tickets. There is a  
 little factory up at the East end that
 mends radios and makes tape recorders 
 called Mchenzie Accoustics.           </content>
