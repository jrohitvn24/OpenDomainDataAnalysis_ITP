		<title>04  Gadgets In My Home</title>
		<content>    In my home I have various eletronic
gadgets.Freezer,washing machine,cooker,
television ect.... However apart from  
my sisters turntable we still lack a   
hi-fi and a video.Sometimes a video can
be very good to have but sometimes if  
people publisise what they've got it   
can lead to a burglary.One element is  
the L.C.D display became when you go   
out,if you don't cover it up when it   
gets dark it covers the room in a emic 
glow.                                  
    I myself have a portable TV,a radio
cassette and a normal radio as well as 
a record player.I tend to like reading 
books beacause they contain more       
information than a TV.A recent fantasy 
called the Box of Delights it was much 
more interesting to read than to watch,
even with the special affects.Books    
are still popular with me. D. Rog
