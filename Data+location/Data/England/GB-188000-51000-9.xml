		<title>09New Mills Pottery</title>
		<content> Mr. Davidson came to New Mills in 1964
 to start the pottery. He{used to live 
{in London}but he thinks it is better  
 living in Cornwall because it has a   
 good climate and it is quiet and      
 peaceful.                             
                                       
 He makes mostly{stoneware pots}for    
 cooking but he also makes{porcelain.  
 He has a metal wheel with an electric 
 motor; it takes about{20 minutes to   
{throw 10 pots}on the wheel. After     
 throwing he puts on handles and lids. 
 Then he bakes the pots in a small     
{kiln,}which he{made himself,}to fire  
 them.                                 
 He sells his pottery in his{own shop  
 in New Mills and in a shop called the 
{'Guild of Ten' in Truro}that he owns a
 share of. He also sells to{other shops
{in Cornwall}as well as to some in     
{London.                               </content>
