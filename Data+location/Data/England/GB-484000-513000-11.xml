 introduction of the 1947 Education    
 Act,the school became a Voluntary     
 controlled Church of England School.In
 1977 the old school was closed and    
 became the Village Hall.The present   
 building had been erected by the      
 N.Y.C.C.. This school wqs opened by   
 the Marquis of Normanby on 20th.May

 transferred from the old school with  
 the staff.                            
 The school now has 62 pupils between  
 the ages of 5 and 11+ years.At 11+
