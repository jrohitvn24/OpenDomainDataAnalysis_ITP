		<title>02The Parish Church</title>
		<content>  The present Parish Church of{St.John 
{the Baptist}was started about 1345 and
 finished by the end of the century.The
 Black Death interrupted building for  
 several years.There have been no major
 additions since then.The main part of 
 the church is built of gritstone and  
 the roof is  covered with lead.Some   
 windows are made of stained glass.They
 show biblical scenes.There is a       
 hexagonal,carved,gritstone pulpit.    
  There are several interesting old    
 tombs. Sir Samson Meveril (died 1462) 
 rests in a marble table tomb in the   
 chancel.There are four other tombs,one
 of which belongs to{Bishop Robert     
{Pursglove}(died 1579).He founded      
 Tideswell Grammar School.This         
 eventually closed about 1932,but the  
 present primary school is named after 
 him.
