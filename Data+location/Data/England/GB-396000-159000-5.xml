		<title>05ST PETER'S CHURCH (2)</title>
		<content> The angel on the right is holding an  
 olive branch.  In the middle window is
 Jesus crowned as King.  Underneath is 
 the Lamb of God.  There is also a flag
 of St George.  At the top there is a  
 hand letting go of a dove. Some people
 who have worked at St Peter's Church  
 have their names in stained glass     
 windows in memory of them.            
    The organ was built by Griffin     
 and  Stroud.  It was built in 1898 and
 restored some time later by George    
 Osmond and Co.  It has two manuals.   
    The altar was in the Lady Chapel   
 origanaly in the Chancel so a new     
 alter was built for the Chancel.  The 
 vestry is where the Choir gets changed
 and there is another room called the  
 sacristy where the vicar gets changed 
 into his robes.                       
                                       
                                       </content>
