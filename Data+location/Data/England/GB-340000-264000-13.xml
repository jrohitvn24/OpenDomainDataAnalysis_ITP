		<title>13LUCTON NEAR AYMESTREY</title>
		<content>   Lucton village lies about 2 mls SW  
 of Aymestrey and is a popular         
 residential area.  It contains 2 farms
 one of 40 acres and the other 220 and 
 some 30 dwellings which includes 4    
 council houses and 5 holiday cottages.
 Although there is no social centre,   
 only one bus a week on Friday (market 
 day in Leominster) no school or shop  
 the residents enjoy their seclusion.  
   In the centre of the village is a   
 church, originally medieval, rebuilt  
 in Victorian times and now converted  
 into a private dwelling which still   
 retains a church-like exterior.       
  Nearby is the former{Lucton School}a 
 private school founded in 1711. The   
 original lovely{Queen Anne}building   
 still stands facing the main road. The
 school was forced to close suddenly in
 1984 due to lack of pupils and        
 consequent financial difficulties.    </content>
