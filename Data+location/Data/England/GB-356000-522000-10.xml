		<content>    MORLAND AREA SCHOOL is a one storey
 building erected in 1974 to replace   
 the Victorian school standing almost  
 opposite.                             
    In 1985 there were four classes of 
 about 20 pupils with a total role of  
 86. The staff consists of the         
 head,Mr.John Davison and three full   
 time assistants.Meals are cooked and  
 served in the school.The school stands
 in its own grounds with a playground  
 and playing field.The view around is  
 superb.                               
    Two mini buses bring in children   
 from Sleagill and Little Strickland.  
    The school is very well equipped   
 with a large library area and is      
 arranged with class teaching areas    
 grouped around a central project/hall.
 It has strong links with the other    
 villages and the Parish Church and    
 village hall  and the community.      </content>
