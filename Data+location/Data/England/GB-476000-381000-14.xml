		<content>{ECOLOGY }North Leverton is on the west
 side of the Trent. The hills to the   
 west protect the area from most       
 heavy snow falls except when from the 
 east. The soil is slow to warm up in  
 the spring but retains moisture in    
 summer because of the heavy clay.     
 Farms are approx 100 hectares in size 
 and generally arable. Footpaths were  
 common  but now are little used.      
 Pollution level low, despite being in 
 sight of power staions. The beck has  
 stickle backs and eels, but being     
 shallow until heavy rainfall water    
 life can change quickly.  The windmill
 has been used to grind corn for over  
 100 years.  Recreation fields are kept
 trimmed and open spaces kept in good  
 order.  It was known as an orchard    
 village but most orchards have been   
 developed but new trees are being     
 planted.                              </content>
