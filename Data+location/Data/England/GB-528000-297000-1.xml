		<title>01THE FENS OF CAMBRIDGESHIRE</title>
		<content> THE AREA SURVEYED BY THE PUPILS OF {  
{COATES COUNTY PRIMARY SCHOOL}IS IN A  
 PART OF THE COUNTY OF CAMBRIDGESHIRE  
  KNOWN AS THE{BLACK FENS}WHICH IS     
 ALMOST ENTIRELY BELOW SEA LEVEL.IT IS 
 AN EMPTY LANDSCAPE,FLAT AND TREELESS, 
 DOMINATED BY THE SEEMINGLY VAST SKY.  
    THE BLACK SOIL IS COMPOSED ALMOST  
 ENTIRELY OF PEAT, AND MAKES THIS AN   
 EXCELLENT AREA TO GROW ARABLE CROPS   
 SUCH AS CEREALS, ROOT CROPS AND SUGAR 
 BEET.THE FIELDS ARE LARGE, FLAT AND   
 CRISS CROSSED BY DRAINAGE DITCHES AND 
 DYKES LIKE THE POLDER LANDS OF        
 HOLLAND. A NETWORK OF ELECTRIC PUMPS  
 ENSURES THE LAND IS NOT FLOODED.      
    UNDERLYING THE PEAT IS A THICK     
 LAYER OF CLAY WHICH IS USED IN THE    
 OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRY OF THE AREA -    
 BRICK MAKING.
