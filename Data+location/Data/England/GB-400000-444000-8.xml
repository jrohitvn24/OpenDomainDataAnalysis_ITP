		<title>08KILDWICK PICNIC</title>
		<content>   On Saturday, June 15th 1985, over 70
 people attended a picnic organised by 
{Kildwick Church Activities Committee.}
 This was a joint effort with the      
 Methodist Chapel and in addition      
 children from the school attended,    
 many of them with their parents.      
   Novelty races were run including a  
 three legged race, sack race and relay
 race. Prizes were awarded to the      
 winners of each race.                 
   Mr. Norris Webb gave a magic show   
 and with some help from the children  
 all his illusions came out right.     
 Parents and children thoroughly       
 enjoyed a game of rounders and        
 following a break for a picnic tea,   
 the afternoon ended with a tug of war 
 event.
