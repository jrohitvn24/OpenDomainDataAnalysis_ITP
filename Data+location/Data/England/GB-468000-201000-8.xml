		<content>Eighty years ago the children of       
Tetsworth used to play cricket, run,   
dance and go to Scouts.Every September 
there was the Tetsworth Feast when a   
fair came to the Village Green, but    
this has dwindled away to nothing. For 
the older people there was the         
Tetsworth Brass Band and the Cricket   
Club. Today the children have to be    
taken by car into Thame for Brownie and
Cub meetings. Within the village there 
are clubs run by the church and a      
Youth Club for 11-18 year olds has     
just started to meet  twice a week.    
The Cricket Club still plays and is    
in the Premier League although there   
a only a few villagers in the team.    
Aunt Sally is played at the Swann Inn. 
There are colt football and cricket    
teams for the boys. A senior football  
team also plays regularly. For the     
ladies there is a thriving W.I.        </content>
