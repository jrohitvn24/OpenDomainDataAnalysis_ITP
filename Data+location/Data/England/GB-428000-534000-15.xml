		<content> An important part of workshop         
 management is carried out by staff of 
 the workshop planning office. The     
 fabrications are the supports made of 
 steel.                                
 The welding compartments are made of  
 steel because if people walk past the 
 sparks will hit them and if it hits   
 the workmen in the eyes they will have
 to go to the medical room. Normally   
 everynew coal face is fitted out with 
 a complete system of face equiptemt   
 including one or more cutter-loaders, 
 a face conveyor, hydraulic roof       
 supports and a stage loader.          
 Many of these items will have been    
 rebuilt in a central workshop.        
 The safety officer has to inspect     
 everything, if everything is alright  
 but if there is one little fault they 
 get it mended.                        
                                       </content>
