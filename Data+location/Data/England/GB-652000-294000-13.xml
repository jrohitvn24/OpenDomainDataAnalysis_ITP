		<content>This church stands at the highest point
in Lowestoft. The spire, which is 50ft.
high, stands on a tower of 70ft.- it   
serves as a landmark for shipping      
entering Lowestoft harbour. The church 
is of dressed flint and limestone and  
stands to the north of the town. In    
1983 the church celebrated its 500th.  
anniversary. The list of rectors dates 
back to 1308. On the north aisle wall  
are memorials to fishermen lost at sea 
and a plaque presented by HMS LOWESTOFT
in 1965. The war memorial chapel       
commemorates 711 men killed in 1914-   
1918 war. The rarest item in the church
is the pre-reformation lectern. The    
font is medieval but the cover was     
added in 1940.
