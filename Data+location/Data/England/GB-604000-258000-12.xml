		<content>The Church of Saint Peter and Saint    
Mary occupies a central site; once     
there were two separate units in this  
place.  Much of the fabric was built in
the 14th century, but it was extensivel
restored in the 19th century. Great    
efforts are currently being made to    
raise money for further repairs.       
       The church has always been      
deeply involved in the community;      
bargains made in the market place were 
sealed in the porch; the vestry was    
used for meetings about the relief of  
poverty and the state of the roads; the
church provided a school. Nowadays the 
involvement has changed its character  
and the present concern is to increase 
the attendance and participation in    
church activities.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
