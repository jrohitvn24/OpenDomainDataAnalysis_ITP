  Ecology  -  Footpaths &amp; Rights of Way
      Within this block there are      
 approximately 3 miles of definitive   
 footpaths.  Most of these extend      
 futher  but only for short distances. 
 As in the rest of the country, these  
 led to and from church, village or    
 places of work and have largely       
 disappeared.  The remaining few are   
 used by ramblers or local walkers and 
 in this area are passable but often   
 with seasonal difficulty as they are  
 used insufficiently to justify their  
 upkeep.                               
      The Rights of Way Committee of   
 the Ross Civic Trust have enlisted the
 help of Parish Councils to try and    
 establish a system of paths which     
 provides less nuisance to farmers by  
 reducing the number of unecessary ones
 crossing their land.                  </content>
