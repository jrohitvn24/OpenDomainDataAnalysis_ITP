		<title>06HOUSING IN A NEW TOWN</title>
		<content> Little land is left rural in this area
 so housing is a  main landcover almost
 everywhere. Bewbush is soon to be     
 completed with high-density estates.  
 So much has been built since the      
 1940's you must look hard for older   
 property in Southgate (larger houses),
 West Green (smaller houses) and Ifield
 (larger village property). New town   
 housing is almost all two-storey. Few 
 medium or high-rise flats can be      
 found. Unusually for Sussex over half 
 the homes are rented from the council 
 but many are now bought by tenants.   
 The most common are council-built     
 homes in short terraces. Some are     
 semi-detached, or flats. Detached     
 homes are less common, always         
 privately owned and expensive. 1950's 
 houses have no garages,and are built  
 by roads or closes. House groups now  
 cluster in walks and closes.          </content>
