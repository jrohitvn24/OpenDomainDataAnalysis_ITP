		<content>  The village is effectively divided   
 into two by the A148 Cromer to Holt   
 road.  Properties to the north of the 
 road are largely set in{woodland}.    
 Most houses are south of the road near
 the church, and are surrounded by     
{farmland. }                           
  Of a significant number of{villagers}
 interviewed, 43% came to the village  
 from outside Norfolk and 39% from     
 within a 10 kilometre radius of the   
 village.  Half have lived in the      
 village for more than 10 years, with  
 one man born in the village 84 years  
 ago.                                  
  Opinion is divided as to whether the 
 village could be improved or not.     
 While some thought{improvements  }    
 (street lighting, shop, public        
 transport, for example) could be made,
 others like it as it is and wish to   
 see{no change.    }                   </content>
