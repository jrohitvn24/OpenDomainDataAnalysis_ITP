		<content> Mrs.Constance Gostello has lived in   
{Chiswell Green}for 50 years and has   
 seen many changes. Her husband died   
 two years ago and since then,she has  
 been without transport. She uses the  
 local shops twice a week because the  
 buses are not reliable and the fare   
 has become increasingly expensive. A  
 visit to St.Albans only takes place   
 when her daughter or a neighbour gives
 her a lift. Mrs.Gostello uses the     
 mobile library which parks in the     
 shopping area once a week and is a    
 member of the Townswomens Guild. The  
 Guild meets monthly in the Church hall
 and has a variety of speakers         
 on subjects ranging from cake making  
 to mountain climbing.Mrs Gostello     
 enjoys acting in the Guild's drama    
 group who perform twice a year for the
 Over Sixties Club as well as their own
 members.                              </content>
