		<title>14Agriculture in Emborough</title>
		<content> The parish of Emborough is            
 predominantly an agricultural area,   
 consisting mainly of family owned and 
 run farms, of 100 to 300 acres, laid  
 down to good pasture, with a few acres
 sown to cereal and root crops.  Milk  
 production is the farmer's main       
 livelihood.  Black and white Freiesen 
 cows can be seen grazing on lush      
 summer grass and in winter, enjoying  
 the warmth of large covered yards     
 which form part of the modern day     
 farm.  These are considered a         
 necessity as winters on Mendip are    
 bleak.  Emborough has its own cheese  
 making factory which takes some local 
 farmers milk.  Small flocks of sheep  
 can also be see on less productive    
 land and some breeding pigs are kept  
 by a few farmers as a secondary source
 of income.                            
                                       </content>
