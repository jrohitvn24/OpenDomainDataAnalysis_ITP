 I got up at 8.15 AM on Saturday, had a
 wash, went downstairs, lay on the sofa
 for about 10 minutes, then had        
 breakfast which was a bowl of         
 Frosties.  At about 8.40 AM I got     
 dressed in my riding clothes and      
 cycled down to Carter's to see my     
 pony.  At 9.15 AM I turned him into   
 the field to graze.  I set to work    
 mucking out his stable.  After mucking
 out I brushed my yard in front of the 
 stable.  Then I went home for lunch.  
 At 1.00 PM I went back to Carter's,   
 groomed my horse then rode him.  I    
 took him down to the field to ride.   
 Then I fed him and went home and had a
 bath at 8.00 PM.  Between 8.00 and    
 11.00 PM I watched television, then I 
 went to bed.
