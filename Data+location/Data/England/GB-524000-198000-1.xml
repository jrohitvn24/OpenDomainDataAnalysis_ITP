		<content> General Description of our 12Km       
 squares                               
 Our Domesday Survey area is divided by
 the M25 motorway which runs across our
 rectangle from east to west.The main  
 east coast railway from London to     
 Scotland runs from north to south     
 across our allocated area.            
 In the north-west corner of our area  
 lies part of Potters Bar.This area is 
 virtually all taken up with           
 owner-occupier housing.               
 The southern part of our rectangle    
 contains Hadley Wood.This is a suburb 
 of London.The houses here are very    
 expensive to buy.Between Potters Bar  
 and Hadley Wood lies a band of        
 farmland.This land is part of London's
 "Green Belt".Included in this "Green  
 Belt"land is the Wrotham Park estate. 
 This old 18th century mansion and its 
 park cover approx.two 1Km.squares.    </content>
