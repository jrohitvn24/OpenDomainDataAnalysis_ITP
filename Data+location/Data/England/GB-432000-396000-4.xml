		<content> Part of our Domesday Survey asked the 
 parents of children in our school     
 which of a number of consumer items   
 they owned. Every one of the surveyed 
 families had a{television,}almost all 
 (96%) had a{telephone,}89% had{central
{heating,}81% a{freezer}and over half  
 (54% and 53% respectively) a{video}and
 a{computer.                           
                                       
 In comparison, patterns of ownership  
 were very different when these parents
 were children themselves. Even then,  
 though, most families (93%) owned a   
 television. However none had a video  
 or a computer. 26% had a telephone and
 less than 18% either a freezer or     
 central heating.                      
                                       
{Times,}it would seem,{have changed.
