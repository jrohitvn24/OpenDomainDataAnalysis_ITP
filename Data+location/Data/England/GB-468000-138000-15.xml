		<content>    When I was five we used to play    
 Kiss Chase.The boys had to chase the  
 girls and kiss us if they caught us.  
    When I was little I used to play   
 Cops and Robbers,a chasing game.We    
 also played Army,usually with British 
 and Germans and sometimes Japanese.   
    When I was eight I used to play    
 hairdressers with my friend Jane.We   
 would take it in turns being the      
 hairdresser and customer and style    
 and plait each other's hair.          
    When I was ten I played Jump the   
 River.If you missed the other bank    
 you would get wet.                    
    We used to play Grass It in a      
 field of long grass.One person        
 counts with his eyes closed,while     
 the others crawl in the grass.Then    
 he has to track them.
