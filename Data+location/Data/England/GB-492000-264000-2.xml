 On Wednesday morning I get up at      
7.30am .I have a wash, get dressed     
and go down for breakfast.I put some   
milk on to boil for my Weetabix.My     
friend, Sarah, calls for me and we     
go up to the shop to collect a paper   
so that my mum can play newspaper      
bingo.When we get back I put my packed 
lunch box in my bag and we walk to     
school.The bell goes at 8.50am. After  
assembly we do Maths and Art.Lunch is  
at 12.15.I have egg sandwiches, a      
yoghurt, biscuit and a drink.We go     
to Dance Club at 12.45.During the      
afternoon we do topic work and         
games.The bell goes at 3.30 and we     
walk home.I have mince, potatoes and   
cabbage for my tea. Afterwards I       
watch televison and go to  bed at      
10.00pm.                               </content>
