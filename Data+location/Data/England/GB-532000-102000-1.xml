		<content>           For an area which loses five
 squares to the sea East Brighton has  
 considerable variety. To the West     
 where it is close to the centre of the
 town it is a densely populated urban  
 area of older housing with some fine  
 Regency buildings and squares         
 overlooking the sea. Further East     
 towards the edge of the town there are
 council and suburban estates both     
 overlooking and lying within the      
 valleys stretching back into the South
 Downs. Downland devoted to farming and
 recreational facilities separates the 
 urban area from Ovingdean, an old     
 village which has now expanded into a 
 commuter suburb. Shingle beaches      
 backed by a promenade with an         
 amusement area form the western part  
 of the coast. The central area is     
 dominated by a marina and the eastern 
 section has chalk cliffs up to 100 ft.</content>
