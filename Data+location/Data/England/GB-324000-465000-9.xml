		<title>09THE BEACH</title>
		<content> Near a fence slightly east of Rampside
 on the seashore the beach consists    
 baasically of shingle. The further    
 towards the sea you go the boggier it 
 becomes and eventually it is a muddy  
 marsh covered in clumps of coarse     
 grass. Here the concrete floord       
 barrier is shattered into huge        
 boulders. The shingle is strewn with  
 litter; old shoes, rusty cans, bags,  
 crisp packets and empty bottles. The  
 father N.E. you go the shingle recedes
 and eventually there is marsh all the 
 way up to the barrier. the marsh is   
 rich in life; little fish live in the 
 pools between the grass clumps and    
 crabs live among the grass. As you    
 turn a corner the marsh disappears and
 the beach becomes a vast expanse of   
 sand and shingle. There is very dense 
 vegetation above the barrier;         
 brambles, hawthorns and many flowers. </content>
