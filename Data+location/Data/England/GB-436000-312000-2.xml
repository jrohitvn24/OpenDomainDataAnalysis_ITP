		<content> The area is under lain by clays and   
 sandstones of the Coal Measure Series 
 with several important coal seems that
 have been worked in the past.In square
 3814 there are remains of shafts that 
 were worked in the 16 and 17          
 centuries.During W.W.2 vast open      
 casting took place in squares 3713 and
 3813.This ground has now been restored
 to agriculture.                       
 The land is mostly west facing. The   
 highest point is Breach Hill(378154)  
 at 147m a.s.l.Several very small      
 streams drain into the Gilwiskaw Brook
 which eventually joins the Trent via  
 the R. Mease and the R.Tame.          
 There is very little woodland left    
 except in squares 3814 and 3814.
