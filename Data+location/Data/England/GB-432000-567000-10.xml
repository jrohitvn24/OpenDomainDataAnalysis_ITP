		<content> Uncle Derek woke all of us up at 9a.m.
 and we all hurried and got dressed.   
 Then we had breakfast of either       
 cornflakes or bacon sandwhiches.Dad   
 took my brother and i to my Aunty     
 Eve's in West Chirton while my sister 
 Margaret went out to play with my     
 cousin and Mam made dinner.At about   
 1o'clock we ate yorkshire puddings,   
 pork,peas,carrots,potatoes and gravy. 
 At about 2o'clock we went out to the  
 leisure pool but to our dismay it was 
 closed,we decide to play outside but  
 it started to rain.At about 4o'clock  
 mam ran us a hot bath after the bath  
 we dressed in our clean clothes.I did 
 violin practice and we all watched    
 cartoons on the video.at about        
 6o'clock we had hot dogs,crisps and   
 cakes .After watching "That's Life" on
 the television it was time for bed.
