		<title>09Homes in Well</title>
		<content> All the homes in the village are      
 comfortable,well decorated,mostly with
 fitted carpets and suitable furniture.
 An open fire is still usual tho' many 
 use background central heating.Most   
 have modern aids-freezers are a boon  
 to store fruit and vegetables from the
 garden. Mixers &amp; food processors are  
 used &amp; several have microwave ovens.  
 Preparing food is very important -    
 home baking is valued - many have a   
 baking morning,and all have 1 &amp; often 
 2 cooked meals a day.Food given to    
 various events is always of a high    
 standard due to W.I. influence perhaps
 or from the older women who were      
 formerly in service.                  
 Mothers seem content to stay at home  
 with young children.No child comes    
 home regularly to an empty house,and  
 no child is overweight.The W.I. meet  
 monthly at Well or Snape.             </content>
