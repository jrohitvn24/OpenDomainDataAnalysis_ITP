		<content>   Two main roads go through Shefford. 
 North to South,the A600 which carries 
 about 5,500 vehicles a day and East to
 West the A507 which carries about     
 6,500 vehicles a day.                 
      The A507 connects the A1 to the  
 M1 and is used by a large number of   
 very large lorries.One vehicle in five
 is a heavy goods vehicle and          
 altogether 12,000 vehicles a day      
 travel through this small town.       
      Both roads have to cross traffic 
 lights in the centre of the town and  
 there are often traffic jams and long 
 delays.                               
      With three schools in the town it
 is very dangerous having such a lot of
 traffic and the townspeople have been 
 trying for a long time to get a       
 by-pass.There are posters all over    
 Shefford which say that we need a     
 by-pass now.                          </content>
