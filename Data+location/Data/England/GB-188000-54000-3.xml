  The Memorial Hall was built to       
 remember the people killed in the 2nd 
 World War. When you are going towards 
 Truro it is on your right just before 
 the crossroads. It is built back off  
 the road with a car park holding 20   
 cars. It is now built of concrete     
 walls and the roof is of tiles, being 
 rebuilt a few years ago. The caretaker
 is Mrs Waters who cleans it and keeps 
 the keys.There are six rooms in the   
 building, the main hall, the boys     
 toilet,the girls toilet, the back     
 stage room, the snack bar room, while 
 out side there is a room in which they
 keep the food. They have Keep Fit     
 there every Thursday and discos once a
 month which start at 7.00 and finish  
 at 11.30. They also have birthday     
 parties and wedding receptions as well
 as youth club meetings.               </content>
