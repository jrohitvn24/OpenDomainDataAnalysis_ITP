 Growth of housing and employment was  
 closely linked to old heavy           
 manufacturing. Its location was       
 contorlled by access to raw materials 
 and river transport. It employed large
 male labour forces in large factories.
 Female employment was in local        
 services, Newcastle City Centre or in 
 "female" trades e.g. clothing. Many   
 females filled so called traditional  
 roles e.g. housewife.                 
 With the collapse of traditional      
 industries there have had to be many  
 major socio-economic adjustments by   
 workers. The only growth has been in  
 service industries and female         
 employment.
