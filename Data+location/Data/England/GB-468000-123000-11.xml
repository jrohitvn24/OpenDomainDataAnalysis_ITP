		<content> Public transport to and from{Langrish}
 is limited to one very infrequent bus 
 service which runs about every{two    
{hours}with the last bus from          
 Petersfield at around seven pm; this  
 service normally costs{eighty pence}. 
 The hamlet of Langrish is dominated by
 the{A272,}making walking by foot      
 dangerous as there isn't any footpath.
 Entertainment in the hamlet is minimal
 for teenagers,but there is a playgroup
 in{East Meon,}and a primary school.   
 There is a close community in Langrish
 as the one place to meet and talk is  
 the church, the other way to keep in  
 touch is the local magazine; "{The    
{Squeaker"} published four times       
 a year by locals, is a free magazine  
 giving news and views about matters   
 in the region. There are plans to     
 divert the lorries away from the A272,
 and the bus service will have to end. </content>
