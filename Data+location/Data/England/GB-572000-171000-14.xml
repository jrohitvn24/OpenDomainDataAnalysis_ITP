		<content> All Plant Operators are taught how to 
 maintain their machines. Should       
 serious faults occur then these have  
 to be repaired by trained fitters in  
 the workshops. Courses are run by the 
 PR&amp;A to train soldiers as fitters.    
 The PR&amp;A courses practice building    
 roads etc, at Lodge Hill. Before they 
 actually carry out real construction  
 work many hours are spent in the      
 classroom using models.               
 The Royal Engineers don't build       
 airfields any more .They do however   
 have a regiment with a responsibility 
 for repairing airfields and they do   
 build runways and pads for Harrier    
 aircraft. All these skills are taught 
 by The PR&amp;A at Lodge Hill.            
 In addition to teaching soldiers from 
 the Infantry and Artillary part of the
 job of PR&amp;A is to teach soldiers from 
 the Royal Mechanical and Electrical   </content>
