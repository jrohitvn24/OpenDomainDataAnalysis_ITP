		<content>   The Digmoor Housing Estate, made up 
of Little Digmoor, Digmoor, Clay Brow, 
and Holland Moor, forms part of the    
Skelmersdale New Town Development and  
was built in the 1960's.               
   The houses are built in rows of     
terraces but differ from one another in
size and design. Some are 3 storeys    
high and there are bungalows and flats.
   Most houses are of traditional brick
but some are prefabricated in concrete.
   Each house has its own small back   
garden which is fenced but front doors 
open directly onto the walkway.        
   The major criticism concerns the    
planning, with houses built overlooking
one another and with no front garden.  
   The majority of accommodation is    
rented but some tenants have seized the
opportunity to buy their own home -    
this can be done even if unemployed!
