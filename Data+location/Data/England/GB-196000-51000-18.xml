		<title>18Village Carnivals</title>
		<content> Carnivals are an important part of    
 Cornish summers. Throughout the summer
 months, people in towns &amp; villages    
 stage their own carnival activities.  
 Fancy dress processions mark the end  
 of each carnival week. After the      
 costumes have been judged, the people 
 join the parade, either on foot or on 
 a decorated float.                    
 In Cornwall there are Fairy Queens and
 Carnival Queens. The Fairy Queens are 
 young girls of about five or six. They
 wear short, frilly, sequined dresses  
 with velvet capes around their        
 shoulders. Usually they ride in the   
 procession in a decorated hatchback   
 car. The Carnival Queens are older    
 girls and they have two attendants    
 each. Their dresses are long and each 
 group have their own choice of        
 colours. The Queens go to many other  
 carnivals hoping to win cups.         </content>
