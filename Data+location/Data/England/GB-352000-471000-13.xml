		<title>13BORWICK HALL (CONT)</title>
		<content> The rooms here are mainly twin bedded.
 A T.V series was filmed here called   
{"The Ghosts of Motley Hall."}It was   
 filmed in the mid 1970's.This was     
 appropriate because the hall is said  
 to be haunted by many{ghosts.}For     
 eg.There is an interesting story about
 two soldiers.Once there was a banquet 
 at Borwick Hall and after it everybody
 went to sit in the library.Under one  
 of the shelves of books was a seat set
 back in the wall.The two men sat on   
 this.After the party they were nowhere
 to be found.They were never seen again
 by anybody.It is said they must have  
 sat on a secret panel and disappeared 
 behind the wall.When the wall was     
 measured it was found that the        
 measurements from the outside were 4ft
 less than the measurements from       
 inside.......
