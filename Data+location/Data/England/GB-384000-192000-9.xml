		<title>09Beverstone Church:Screen.</title>
		<content> The rood screen stands beneath the    
 fourteenth century chancel arch.The   
 wood is very dark and ancient with    
 some golden ornamentation.It consists 
 of three bays with a more recent rood 
 in lighter wood set above it.This was 
 added in 1907.The screen itself has   
 had an interesting history.It was     
 removed in 1842 during the restoration
 ff the church.However,in the 1880's it
 was rescued from the rectory garden   
 where it had been acting as a pergola!
 It has been conjectured that the      
 screen was orginally made up of five  
 bays and that it stood in front of the
 chancel arch.Behind the pulpit there  
 is a doorway leading to stairs which  
 originally gave access to the rood    
 loft.
