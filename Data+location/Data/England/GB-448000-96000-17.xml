		<content>{Saint Mary's},a rare commonwealth     
 church was built in 1657. The Ward    
 family who owned Northwood House and  
 park were devout Catholics. They paid 
 for the John Nash tower to be built   
 in 1874 and for the renovations of the
 body of the church in 1867.           
 The church seats 900 and has two      
 galleries. It has an organ built in   
 1874, a sundial over the glass door   
 dated 1762 and stained glass windows  
 dedicated to families in Cowes.An     
 underground passage leads to          
 Northwood Park.                       
 In East Cowes the{Convent of Our Lady 
 is the home for twelve sisters of an  
 open order who run Holy Cross school. 
 The house is believed to have been    
 built by Sir George Shedden for his   
 bride to be and is still visited by   
 members of the Shedden family.
