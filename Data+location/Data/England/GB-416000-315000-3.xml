		<title>03Customs in Wychnor</title>
		<content>The lords of the manor of Wychnor in   
the middles ages were the de           
Sommerville family.  According to      
tradition they were granted the manor  
by John of Gaunt on condition that they
provided a flitch (side) of bacon to   
any couple living on their own estates 
who could prove that they had not      
argued during their first year of      
marriage.  There were three couples who
claimed the flitch, but two of them    
were found to be lieing.  This custom  
is recorded on the fireplace of the    
present Wychnor Hall.  The fireplace   
is one of the few remnants of the old  
hall and is dated 1337.  There is a    
wooden, life-sized carving of the      
flitch, with the words of the story,   
above the fire-place. The custom fell  
into disuse in the 16th century        
through lack of claimants.
