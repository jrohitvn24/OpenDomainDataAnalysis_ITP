 on land on Stamford Street which      
 formerly held a mill.It could be      
 considered the main entertainment

      It is available for theatre      
 productions, dancing, receptions and a
 great number of indoor sports.Mossley 
 A.O.D.S. hold several productions each
 year.                                 
      During the week many activities  
 take place such as Karate, gymnastics 
 and table tennis. A Disco for young   
 people is held every Tuesday evening. 
 During school holidays play schemes   
 are often held.                       
      A recent extension has increased 
 the size of the stage and now more    
 lavish sets can be built on stage.
