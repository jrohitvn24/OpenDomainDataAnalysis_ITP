		<title>13Junior Red Cross. Woking.</title>
		<content>  Samantha is a junior member of the   
 Red Cross.                            
  We have our Red Cross meetings on    
 Wednesday evenings from 6.15 to 7.15. 
 We do quite a few courses and do exams
 at the end of them. Last year I did my
 First Aid exam and this year I did my 
 Home Nursing exam and got my          
 certificates.Now I am doing my Message
 exam which is sending secret codes.   
  We have lots of outings to Thorpe    
 Park and The Sandpits. We have special
 visits too with our exams like the    
 Fire Station and the Police Station.  
  We have people to see us at the      
 Centre like a Policeman who told us   
 about his work and a Fireman who had  
 come in the fire engine and told us   
 about his work and all about the fire 
 engine.                               
  The Red Cross helps the sick and     
 suffering all over the world.         </content>
