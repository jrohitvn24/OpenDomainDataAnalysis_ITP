		<content>What are the thoughts of a young girl  
after visiting Chatham cemetery?       
It is lonely and peaceful.             
Most of the tombstones are overgrown   
and crumbling.                         
Some are as old as 1824.               
It is sad to see children who died as  
young as two days old.                 
Many headstones have writing with      
"Loving Memory" or "Gone,but not       
forgotten".                            
Lots of graves have green granite      
stone.Some are made of marble.         
More than one person may be buried     
together.                              
A change of mood.                      
On the Delce estate fear of            
unemployment and the gaining of        
material possessions are important     
issues.In Borstal many are keen to     
maintain a village feeling.
