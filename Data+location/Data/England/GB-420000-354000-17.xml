		<content>   All Saint's church, a Chapel of Ease
 of Bradbourne is a simple building    
 consisting of a plain nave and chancel
 with seating for 70.  The building    
 itseld shows  that a church existed   
 here in the days of the Normans, many 
 of the Norman features were 'restored'
 during the last century.  A Directory 
 of 1857 mentions that the church was  
 'renewed &amp; thoroughly renovated in    
 1837 at a cost of Â£80, raised by      
 subscriptions, later directories      
 speak of it being restored at a cost  
 of Â£570 in the 1880s. An unusual      
 feature in the fire place high up in  
 the west wall, used to be a loft which
 provided over-night lodging for a     
 priest from Bradbourne to celebrate   
 early mass, in the days when the      
 church, along with the mother church  
 at Bradbourne belonged to the Priory  
 of Dunstable.There is no burial ground</content>
