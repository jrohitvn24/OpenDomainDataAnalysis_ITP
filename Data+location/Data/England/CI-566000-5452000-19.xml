		<title>19The Legend of St. Martin</title>
		<content>   St. Martin the{patron saint}of our  
 parish was born in Hungary. He later  
 lived in Italy and joined the Roman   
 army.  It was a very cold day when    
 Martin was riding to Amiens.  As he   
 passed through the gates he saw a     
 beggar sitting by the road.  He was   
 very cold and wearing rags.  He begged
 Martin for money but, as he didn't    
 have any, he took his{cloak,}cut it   
 in half and gave half to the beggar.  
 Before the man could thank him, he    
 rode off.  In the middle of the night 
 Martin was woken up by a bright       
 light. Jesus stood by his bed and said
 "You cared for me and loved me. I was 
 the beggar and you gave me your       
 cloak." Martin could not sleep.  He   
 got up and went to the closest church,
 found the priest and asked to be      
 baptised.                             
                                       </content>
