		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO OUR D_BLOCK.</title>
		<content>  Our Domesday block is situated in a  
 rural area and contains part of the   
 village of Ayelsham, and the smaller  
 villages of Nonington, Barfreston,    
 Frogham,Elvington and Snowdown. It is 
 in the south east of Kent close to    
 Dover ,the busiest ferry port in the  
 British Isles, and the cathedral city 
 of Canterbury.                        
  There is very little industry and    
 many of the  inhabitants work at the  
 collieries or on the land.            
  The villages of Elvington and        
 Aylesham were built at the begining of
 this century to house the miners from 
 Snowdown and Tilmanstone Collieries.  
  At the centre of the area is         
 Fredville Estate which covers         
 about 2000 acres and consists of      
 woodland parkland and recreational    
 parkland.                             
                                       </content>
