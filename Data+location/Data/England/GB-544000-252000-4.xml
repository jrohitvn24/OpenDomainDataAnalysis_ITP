		<content>  We asked people questions about      
 themselves and their village. One of  
 these questions was 'What improvements
 would you like to see ?' In reply to  
 this, people seemed satisfied with the
 village as it was. 'Where did they    
 shop ?' Most of those questioned      
 shopped in Cambridge, because as they 
 were in Cambridge sometimes up to five
 times a week, they did their shopping 
 then. Some people said they only used 
 the village shops for buying small    
 items. Another question was 'How did  
 they get around town ?', most of the  
 people questions replied that they had
 cars but old people said they walked  
 and rarely left the village.
