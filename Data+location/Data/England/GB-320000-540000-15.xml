		<title>15Playing out at Fletchertown.</title>
		<content> I come out of school at half past     
 three and I walk home with Tracey,my  
 friend.I ask her if she is going to   
 play out after tea.She usually says   
 yes and that she will come for me.I go
 into my house and throw my coat and   
 bag on to the couch and then I have my
 tea. When Tracey comes we go out to   
 play.Sometimes we play rounders and   
 sometimes we play cricket.After a     
 while I hear my mam shout'Sonia!'and  
 that means I have to go in for my     
 supper.I often have chips,sausage and 
 pop to drink.I go out again when I    
 have finished and then we play        
 rounders at my auntie Elsie's corner, 
 which is the corner between Coronation
 Terrace and South Street.We pick team 
 and this is how we play.You hold the  
 bat and someone throws the ball so you
 have to hit it and run round a square 
 pitch before the ball is brought back.</content>
