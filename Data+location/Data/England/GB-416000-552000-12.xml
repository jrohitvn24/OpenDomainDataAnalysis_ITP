		<title>12ECONOMICS_POCKET MONEY_</title>
		<content> We get pocket money every week.We     
 spend half of it,and the other half we
 save.Of corse we dont buy our clothes 
 and shoes(our parents buy those) but  
 we do buy most of our sweets,comics,  
 stickers etc.Some people save up for  
 jewellery,some people save up for     
 games,some save up for presents and   
 others save just for the sake of      
 saving.We spend quite a lot of our    
 money on going to the swimming baths  
 and sports centre.We buy most of our  
 records and tapes but only now and    
 then.The style of music varies        
 a lot.Most people spend their money on
 things that they can collect for      
 example,rubbers,stamps,keyrings       
 and postcards.Money is also spent on  
 special occasions such as             
 Birthdays,Christmas,Anniversaries,    
 Mothers and Fathers day.At the end of 
 the week we dont have much money left.</content>
