		<title>04SALT MARSHES, WELLS, NORFOLK</title>
		<content>The salt marshes lie to the East of    
Wells and stretch for about 5 km       
towards Weybourne.                     
A line deciduous trees separates the   
farmland from the marsh with its       
distinctive vegetation lining the muddy
and sandy creeks.                      
Between the trees and the sea the marsh
vegetation consists of various grasses,
Sea Aster, Sea Blite, Sea Plantain, Sea
Pink and a small green planed Samphire.
This is a fleshy segmented plant which 
is edible and is gathered and sold     
commercially. Another harvest of the   
sands beyond the marsh is the cockle,  
most famous of which is the "Stukey    
Blue".                                 
Shore crabs are plentiful in this area;
they scavenge for decaying material    
produced in the salt marsh.These and   
other creatures provide food for       
thousands of waders and wild fowl.     </content>
