		<title>10COMBE FARM N HARRIS</title>
		<content> The main enterprises at Combe Farm in 
 1985 were Beef and Lamb production,   
 pig fattening and corn growing.       
 The cattle are mainly Herefords but we
 also have some continental breeds     
 including Charolais, Limousin and     
 Simmental.They are bought on as calves
 and grown on for the butcher to a     
 weight of 250 - 300 kilos. Lambs      
 bought in the Autumn are also fattened
 for the local butcher, but the pigs   
 are on contract to  one of the largest
 grain millers in the area.            
 The harvest this year was particularly
 difficult with a very wet July and    
 August but an unusually dry Autumn    
 enabled above average yields. Oats and
 Barley are home grown for use as      
 fodder. Prices have remained stable   
 for livestock over the year and do not
 appear to have kept pace with price   
 rises in other commodities.           </content>
