		<content> Battle of Ethandune                   
    It is generally accepted by        
 historians that Edington is where King
 Alfred defeated the Danes in 878AD.   
    Following months of lost battles   
 Alfred's army was scattered throughout
 the plain and the Somerset Levels     
 while Guthrum rested his troops to the
 north in Chippenham .Slowly the word  
 was passed around that Alfred would   
 reform his army under the Great Oak   
 (near Warminster) on a certain day and
 march north. Guthrum soon learned of  
  this and marched southwards. It      
 was a race as to who could reach the  
 top of the plain escarpment  first and
 thus have advantage.Alfred did        
 and made camp to await the enemy.     
    The Danes were eventually beaten   
 and chased back to Chippenham where   
 Guthrum surrendered and was baptised a
 Christian.                     {      </content>
