		<content> My mum works at Wardle High School.   
 She is a cleaner and she works from   
 Mon-Thurs because on Friday she       
 finishes half an hour early at night. 
 My mum has lots of friends at Wardle  
 High because she says that there are a
 lot of nice people there.She doesn't  
 mind working there because it is just 
 down the road from our house.         
  At Christmas they have Christmas     
 parties and most of them get a little 
 bit drunk. My mum also knows most of  
 the teachers (so I had better be      
 careful!)I don't like it very much    
 when we have to have tea at 6.30p.m.  
 My mum is not in to cook my breakfast 
 and get me up so I have to do it      
 myself.Every night she comes home and 
 says "I've had a very busy day." We   
 all try to help her.I am looking      
 forward to starting at high school in 
 September.                            </content>
