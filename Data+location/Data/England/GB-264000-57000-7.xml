 There seems to be a big difference    
 between the number of cars travelling 
 east and west.There could be two      
 reasons for this ,they could either be
 making an early start to a holiday in 
 the south west or ,as suggested by the
 greater number of foreign cars        
 travelling west ,they may have been   
 heading for the Plymouth _ Roscoff    
 ferry which leaves mid afternoon.     
{Saturday 6th July}                    
 There is much less heavy transport    
 traffic on Saturdays as most companies
 only work from Mondays to Saturdays.  
 There was much more holiday traffic   
 than in mid week as most people begin 
 their holidays on Saturday.
