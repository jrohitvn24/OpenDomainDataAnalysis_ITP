		<title>18Where We Live</title>
		<content>   We all live in terraced, detached or
 semi-detached houses or bungalows.    
   I live in a semi-detached house on  
 Lakeside Estate. We have a fairly     
 large front garden but only a patio at
 at the back. The house has a lounge, a
 kitchen-diner and three bedrooms.     
    My house is an individual detached 
 house. It has a garden at the front   
 and the rear. It contains three       
 bedrooms, a lounge, a dining room, a  
 big kitchen and porches at the front  
 and the back. We have gas central     
 heating and part double glazing. The  
 garage is at the back.                
    I live in a terraced house, that   
 is, one where other houses are joined 
 on to mine on both sides.The front    
 door is on the street so we do not    
 have a front garden. It is a two      
 bedroomed house. We have an allotment 
 nearby.                               </content>
