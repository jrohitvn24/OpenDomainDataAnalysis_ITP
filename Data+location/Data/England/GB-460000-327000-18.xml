		<content> This nursing home for the elderly     
 opens in late autumn 1985. Set in an  
 acre of ground, it consists of        
 renovated and adapted farm buildings  
 adjacent to a farmhouse (privately    
 occupied). The farmer started this    
 venture when he could not get planning
 permission for residential or         
 industrial development of the         
 redundant buildings. There are 21     
 single bedrooms and 4 double rooms on 
 ground level; ultimately 30 residents 
 will be accommodated. Staff rooms and 
 a guest room are on the first floor.  
 Provision for a small number of       
 couples is envisaged. Several rooms   
 will look out on to a courtyard       
 garden. The public rooms overlook the 
 gently rolling countryside.
