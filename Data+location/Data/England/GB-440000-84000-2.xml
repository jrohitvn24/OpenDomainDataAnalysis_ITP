		<title>02The Village of Calbourne</title>
		<content>       There has been a village in     
{Calbourne}for over a thousand years.  
 The present village is one of the few 
 in Britain that still exists in its   
{traditional}form. This fact generates 
 considerable outside interest in the  
 area. Much of the non-agricultural    
 business is therefore related to the  
 seasonal{tourist trade.}              
       The main attraction for visitors
 is the quaint old street known locally
 as{Winkle Street.}A stream, the{Caul  
{Bourne,}runs the full length of the   
 street of mainly thatched cottages.   
 Most of the village is within a       
 carefully controlled{Conservation     
{Area.}Although conserved externally   
 most of the houses have been          
 modernised internally, including the  
 installation of 'indoor plumbing.' In 
 many cases the work has been carried  
 out by the local builders, Brett Bros.</content>
