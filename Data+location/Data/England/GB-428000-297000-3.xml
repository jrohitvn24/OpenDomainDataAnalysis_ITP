		<content>Atherstone did not escape the results  
of great changes in the 16th century.  
Wealthy families bought monastic lands 
after the suppression of Merevale Abbey
and town friary which at that time were
owned by Mount Grace Abbey in Yorkshire
The availibility of extra land         
alleviated the problems of a growing   
population.600 inhabitants occupied 135
houses built along the Watling Street  
(now known as Long St)and Market Place.
At the end of the century the density  
of population had increased by 50%.This
created more of a food problem and the 
reoccurrence of epidemics.Atherstone   
lost a large number of its population  
in 1558-9 with influenza.Also in 1604  
probably the plague killed 145 people  
and many local families disappeared    
from records after this date.
