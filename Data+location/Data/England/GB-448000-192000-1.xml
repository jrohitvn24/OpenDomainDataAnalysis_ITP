		<content>    Our 4km by 3km block is an area of 
{south Oxfordshire}situated between    
 Abingdon and Didcot.It is bounded by  
 the villages of{Drayton}in the north  
 west,{Culham}in the north east and    
{Milton}in the the south west.There is 
 no town in our D-block but it         
 encompasses a total of four villages; 
 the three all ready mentioned plus the
 village of{Sutton Courtenay.}The{River
{Thames}meanders through the block and 
 because of this the area is low       
 lying.It is characterised by farm land
 and some pasture but mainly           
 arable.Each village has its own       
 Primary school but at the transfer age
 of eleven all children are bussed into
 a Comprehensive school in either      
 Abingdon or Didcot.Our D-block is     
 criss-crossed by minor roads,it       
 contains several farms and a power    
 station.                              </content>
