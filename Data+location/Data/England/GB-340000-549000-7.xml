		<title>07PIG FARM _ WOODSIDE(PART II)</title>
		<content> The pigs which are kept here are a    
 cross betwen a{Large White}boar and a 
 hybrid female.They are specially bred 
 for top quality meat production.      
 Mr.Sinclair,who is in the manager of  
 Cavray's(the trade name of Cavaghan   
 and Gray's) pig farms,said that the   
 biggest problem with intensive pig    
 farming was disease and that his bills
 for the vet's services were           
 "astronomical".Common diseases were;  
 pneumonia,foot and mouth,aujesky's    
 disease,scour and Smedi virus.Smedi   
 virus causes the sows to lose their   
 litter.Mr.Sinclair said that they try 
 to prevent disease by providing very  
 good ventilation,innoculation,strict  
 hygiene and giving visitors protect_  
 ive footwear and clothing.            
 On average Cavray's expect to get 360 
 rashers of bacon from each pig as well
 as gammon,fore and leg joints.        </content>
