		<content>  As you approach the village, the well
 known local landmark,{Stratton's      
{Folly,}can be seen on the skyline.    
 Built in 1789 by Admiral Stratton ,the
 brick tower is 100 ft. high,and stands
 on land 350ft. above sea level.It has 
 135 steps to the top, and there is a  
 room on each floor.It is now a private
 residence.                            
  There are various stories as to why  
 it was built. One theory is for       
 astronomical purposes, another is that
 it was to enable him to see ships     
 coming up the Thames!                 
  Another interesting building is the  
{Manor House.}It has always been a     
 private residence, and was once owned 
 by the famous circus owner, Bertram   
 Mills. The present owner showed us    
 records of rent paid back in the 17th 
 century.                              
                                       </content>
