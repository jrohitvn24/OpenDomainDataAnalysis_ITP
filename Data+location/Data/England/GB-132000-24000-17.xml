		<content> Our neighbour{Mrs. Williams}gets up at
 8am and has a cup of tea. She then    
 has a bath and gets dressed. After    
 this she has a breakfast of wholemeal 
 toast and tea. Then she makes her bed 
 and washes the dishes, and does the   
 rest of her housework. At about 11am  
 with a friend from the Salvation Army 
 she starts her daily visits. These    
 visits are to old people who are sick,
 lonely or disabled. Then on to the    
{hospital}for further visiting of the  
 sick. She has a light lunch at 1pm.   
 The afternoon consists a Salvation    
 Army service followed by a visit to   
 the {Cheshire Homes }at{Marazion.}Then
 sometimes she collects for charity if 
 theres time, she returns home and has 
 an evening meal at 6pm. she then      
 enjoys listening to{Radio Cornwall }  
 while knitting or sewing.
