		<content>  The village predates the Domesday    
 Survey in which it is referred to as  
{"RIETON",}or Rye Farm. It is situated 
 12 Km SE from the centre of Coventry. 
{ The village is cut in two by the A45.
 In former days it was an important    
 staging post. There are around 400    
 dwellings in the village.             
  There is a large number of older     
 villagers and a growing number of     
 younger commuters.                    
  The church is the nub of the village 
 community. Older villagers feel       
{neglected}by the Local Authorities    
 because of the{lack of amenities}in   
 the village, coupled with the{poor bus
{service.}Residents who do not own a   
 car have to rely on the church run    
 "car pool"; or remain{isolated.       
  Older villagers also{feel threatened 
 by the{influx}of "outsiders", they see
 their whole way of life is{changing.  </content>
