		<title>13E.W.KING, SEED MERCHANTS</title>
		<content> E.W.King owns 310 acres of land on the
 Coggeshall road.The company started in
 1923,and now grows runner beans,peas, 
 lupins,lettuce,corn,etc.They have a   
 problem with rabbits,pigeons,(which   
 eat the seeds)and insects.Fences are  
 put up to keep out rabbits and        
 scarecrows fend off birds.Mr.Phillips 
 said that only 5% of King's seeds are 
 English.Monk's Fm.is apparently a     
 small farm compared with ones in      
 California and other foreign places.16
 people work for Mr.Phillips.Monk's    
 Farm used to be owned by the Westerns 
 of Felix Hall.Then in 1914 E.W.King   
 bought the land.He died in 1930.      
 Mr.Phillips has 7 tractors ,and 3     
 combines.20 yrs.ago,there were 18     
 men,and 10 women on the farm. They    
 sell their seeds to companies like    
 Suttons and Hursts.
