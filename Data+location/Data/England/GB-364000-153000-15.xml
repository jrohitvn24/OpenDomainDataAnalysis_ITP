		<content> The Radstock, Midsomer Norton and     
 district museum society held a public 
 meeting on Tuesday to consider the way
 forward. An old mining office in      
 Radstock could house the local museum 
 providing it is made safe. Next week  
 Wansdyke District Council are holding 
 a special meeting at which the Tory   
 leader (David Wilshire) will be       
 questioned about an alleged interest  
 in the Hollies development in Midsomer
 Norton. Schoolboy Jason Self (aged 11)
 picked up a rust-encrusted object frp,
 a stream near his home and took it    
 home. His father realized it was a    
 World War two grenade and called the  
 army experts who took it away for     
 examination. Extracts from Somerset &amp;
