		<content> We were waiting with great            
 anticipation to know the area we had  
 been allocated. It seemed that every  
 new day brought with it a different   
 area which we sometimes shared with   
 others schools and sometimes did not. 
 Finally we embarked on the survey     
 after carefully ensuring that our     
 class had chosen the best option. The 
 "Red Peril" was threatened with a     
 certain driver and it leapt into      
 action, obediently following          
 directions which at times seemed      
 impossible. Down narrow tracks, over  
 bus-passes,along the highways and     
 by-ways we travelled. Not one         
 telephone or post-box was left        
 undiscovered..... pity they were not  
 needed.                               
 Never mind it's finished and so are   
 we.
