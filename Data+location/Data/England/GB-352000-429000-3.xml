		<content>                Preston has a main line
 station and is situated in the middle 
 of the London to Glasgow mainline.    
 Inter_City trains run every hour to   
 and from London. It is a chief place  
 for changing trains for Blackpool,    
 Manchester, Liverpool, Barrow, Leeds, 
 Blackburn and Colne.                  
                The main traffic       
 involves passenger trains running for 
 businessmen, holidaymakers and day    
 trippers. The main freight traffic is 
 steel, coal, cement, raw materials and
 general mixed freight. Oil trains pass
 through Preston Docks on the freight  
 only spur from the station. There is a
 large parcels depot at Preston as it  
 is a key distribution centre for the  
 country. It is also a very important  
 centre for postal traffic.
