		<title>15HALFWAY EGG FARM</title>
		<content>  Halfway egg farm has got 8000        
 chickens. There are four to a cage.   
 The eggs fall down into a trough. The 
 eggs are collected twice daily, at    
 0830 and 1500. 5844 eggs were         
 collected on Sunday, the 30th June,   
 1985. Each day the chickens get       
 through a ton of food. They eat a     
 mixture of wheat, maize, soya bean,   
 barley, protein and grit. Grit hardens
 the shell on the egg. The hens'       
 lifespan is 14 months. Then they are  
 slaughtered and sold to the           
 supermarkets. They cannot be roasted  
 because they are not tender enough, so
 they have to be boiled. Halfway egg   
 farm is next to the Sheppey Court     
 retirement home.
