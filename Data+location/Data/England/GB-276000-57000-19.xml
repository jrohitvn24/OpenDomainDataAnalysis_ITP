		<content> The survey area comes mostly within   
 the area of the parish of Harberton,  
 which has two wards - Harberton and   
 Harbertonford. The Parish council     
 is made up of twelve people, six from 
 each ward. Harberton parish council   
 comes under the South Hams District   
 Council.                              
  Law and order is not considered      
 a problem by residents of the area,   
 although many remarked that some      
 credit must go to a policeman who     
 lives in the village and although not 
 a community officer for the area is   
 very active in local life.
