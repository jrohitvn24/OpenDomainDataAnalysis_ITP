 long ending in a footpath through     
 woods. Contains, highly individual,   
 mainly detached houses and bungalows  
 set well back on their plots, sold to 
 people returning after the war. Most

 recently.A typical home is brick-built
 with all modern conveniences including
 gas and may be using its old asbestos 
 chalet as a garden shed or garage.    
{PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS   
    There are very limited bus services
 to Watford and Hemel Hempstead so most
 people rely on personal motor vehicles
 or pushbikes to travel out of the     
 village. Other forms of communication 
 include a postal service and both     
 personal and public telephones.
