		<title>13Middlestone Moor School.</title>
		<content> Our school is{106 years old.}Part of  
 it is quite modern, but is in need of 
 repair. We sometimes have an invasion 
 of ants from our wall because there is
 an ant's nest there. Our hall is 20   
 years old, it has a stage but it's    
 nothing fancy. Our floors are made of 
 wooden boards. The paint is peeling   
 off things. The heating does not      
 always work. There are{147 pupils}in  
 the school, most of them are pleasant 
 people and we all get on quite well.  
 Our 6 teachers are nice. Our school   
 has been changed recently by the      
 county librarian. He came and made our
 library almost as good as a county    
 library. To say we work in an old     
 school would be right but we use      
 modern equipment such as computers and
 videos. One class has done a play     
 about the making of the original      
 Domesday Book and we have filmed it.  </content>
