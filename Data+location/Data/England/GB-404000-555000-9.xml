 ON SUNDAY I WENT FOR A WALK BY THE    
 RIVER SIDE WITH JULIAN.   FIRST WE    
 HELPED MY DAD GET THE COWS INTO THE   
 PARLOUR THEN WE SET OFF FROM DURHAM   
 FIELD.   WE WERE WALKING IN A WOOD    
 WHEN A PHEASANT FLEW UP AND WE LOOKED 
 IN THE GRASS AND THERE WERE FIVE      
 BABIES.  WHEN THEY SAW US THEY RAN.   
 JULIAN CAUGHT ONE AND HE LET ME HOLD  
 IT.  AT FIRST IT WRIGGLED,BUT THEN IT 
 STOPPED.  IT WAS VERY SOFT. THEN I    
 PUT IT DOWN AND CARRIED ON WE WALKED A
 LITTLE WAY AND WE SAW A DIPPER THEN WE
 CAME TO SOME BIG NETTLES. THERE WAS A 
 TREE THAT HAD FALLEN DOWN.  WE WALKED 
 ALONG IT SO THAT WE WOULD NOT GET     
 STUNG.  THEN WE CAME TO SOME BIG      
 ROCKS, THERE WAS A BIG HOLE, NEARLY   
 AS BIG AS ME, THERE WAS GRASS COVERING
 THE HOLE AND I FELL IN.               </content>
