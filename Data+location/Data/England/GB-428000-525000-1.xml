The relief of the land is relatively   
flat, with a maximum height of 95m     
above sea level. There are no major    
valleys. There is one major river which
runs through the area and it is the    
Skerne. In addition, there is a small  
Woodham Burn which runs through the    
north western part of the area.        
  A large proportion of the land cover 
is given over to farmland which is on  
fairly flat ground. The remaining land 
is given over to settlement which is   
found in the south west part of the    
area. In this region, there are also   
three schools.                         
  Crossing north south through the area
is the A1(M) motorway and a major      
railway linking Newcastle and London.
