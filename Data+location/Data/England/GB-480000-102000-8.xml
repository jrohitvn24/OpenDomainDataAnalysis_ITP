		<content> There are{no factories or offices}in  
 Fishbourne. Most people have to{travel
 into{Chichester,Portsmouth}or even    
{London}to{work.}The only places       
 providing employment in Fishbourne are
 the rest homes,pubs,or small village  
 stores/postoffices and farms.Most     
 fathers are either{professionals}or   
 work as management{executives.}Most   
 mothers work{locally}(Chichester), as 
 housewives,or both. In the past most  
 villagers were employed locally on the
 farms,in mainly unskilled jobs.       
 Although the land is still used for   
{agriculture,}the use has changed to   
 mainly{cereal and grass}crops,with    
 very few people employed.The oldest   
 family in the school,the Scarterfields
 ,owns Leggatts Farm,growing barley to 
 feed their pigs.
