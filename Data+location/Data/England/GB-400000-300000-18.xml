		<title>18SURVEY OF COMMUNICATIONS</title>
		<content>  The following shows the result of a  
 survey of communications used in our  
 area.                                 
 57% Telephone                         
 24% Telephone + extension             
 86% Public phone (5 mins walk)        
 57% Public phones were working        
 90% Public phones had been recently   
 vandalised                            
 62% Found the post satisfactory       
 15% Sent personal letters once a month
    Many people felt the post was too  
 expensive. Very few people sent       
 personal letters, presumably they     
 preferred the phone.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
