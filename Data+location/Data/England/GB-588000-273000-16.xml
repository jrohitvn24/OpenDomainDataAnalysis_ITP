		<content>Honington All Saints church was founded
in Norman times, and still boasts a    
fine Norman decorated entrance .       
It serves the villages of Honington and
Sapiston, the latter having a redundant
church. It is a small building with    
seating for about 60 people, plus choir
stalls. A small organ resides at the   
rear of the building, beneath the      
square bell-tower housing two working  
bells.                                 
The parish comes under the jurisdiction
of Ixworth, and has the unusual        
distinction of being led by a full-time
deaconess.                             
There were at one time two Methodist   
churches, but the Primitive building   
has recently been demolished and flint 
houses built on the site, whilst the   
other, on Ixworth Road, has been       
converted into a dwelling.
