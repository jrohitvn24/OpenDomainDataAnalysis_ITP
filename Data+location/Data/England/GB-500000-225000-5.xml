 Wheat is the grain most widely used   
 for making bread, so it is a very     
 important crop. Wheat is grown on     
 farms, the ear is ground for bread and
 biscuits.Wheat is also made into some 
 animal food.The straw at the bottom of
 the ear is used for animal bedding.   
 Sometimes the seeds inside the ear are
 re _ sown for the following year's    
 crop.                                 
{BARLEY:}_                             
 Barley is a cereal grain. There are   
 many different varieties of it but    
 those grown in Great Britain have     
 heads made up of tiny kernels, each   
 of which is enclosed in a sheath or   
 hull. At the tip of the sheath is a   
 long and brittle spike known as awn.  
 Barley is used for making beer. It    
 also provides an important source of  
 animal food.                          </content>
