		<title>11TWO METHODIST CHAPELS.</title>
		<content> The chapels at Peters Marland and     
 Rowden were built in 1873 and 1905    
 respectively, and became part of the  
 Methodist Church in 1932. The Minister
 takes services at the chapels on a    
 rota basis, with accredited Lay       
 Preachers when he is not available.   
 Rowden has two services every Sunday  
 and special services such as Harvest  
 Festivals which are well attended as  
 many people from other parishes have  
 friends or relatives buried in the old
 graveyard there, and always come on   
 those days. Some chapel members also  
 belong to the Circuit Choir. Peters   
 Marland, with a membership of just 12,
 hold their services fortnightly.
