		<content> Amongst the village services for      
 Collingbourne Kingstone the petrol    
 filling station must rank as the most 
 important as villagers mainly rely on 
 private vehicles for transportation.  
 The filling station supplies the only 
 petrol for a five mile radius and also
 carries out general repairs as well as
 selling used cars. The only           
 competition in petrol sales was       
 formerly at Everleigh but this closed 
 down early l985 along with the        
 adjoining cafe.                       
 The fire, police and ambulance        
 services covering both villages are   
 run on a regional basis.              
 Despite most houses having their own  
 telephone, there is a public telephone
 booth in each village.
