		<content> The cows calve during September,      
 October and November. When a cow has  
 calved, the calves start drinking     
 milk. After the calf has been with its
 mother for 24 hours, it is taken away 
 and drinks milk from a bucket.        
                                       
 A calf weighs about 40 to 50kg at     
 birth. A bull calf would usually make 
 between Â£80 to Â£100 when sold at three
 weeks. The heifers are weaned at about
 six weeks, they are reared on the farm
 and join the herd at two years, after 
 calving.                              
                                       
                                       
 Fleed Farm is 130 acres, but 30 acres 
 is very steep ground. Fertiliser is   
 spread on the fields every month      
 during the summer.If there is not much
 rain, grass becomes rather scarce in  
 the summer.                           </content>
