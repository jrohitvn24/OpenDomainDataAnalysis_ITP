		<title>19THE GREAT BED OF WARE</title>
		<content> The Great Bed of Ware was said to have
 taken 30 years to make by Jonas       
 Fosbrooke for {Edward IV}for royal use
 on state occasions and was completed  
 in 1463.                              
 The bed is 2 metres high,3metres wide 
 and 3 metres long.The bed was first   
 installed at Ware Manor but when {    
{Thomas Fanshawe}moved he discarded the
 bed and it was purchased by a local   
 inn.                                  
 In 1610 Prince Ludwig Friedrich of    
 Wurttemberg stayed in Ware at the     
 White Hart Inn and slept in the bed.  
 In its time the bed has also been in  
 the George,the Crown,the Saracen's    
 Head and Rye House Hotel.It is now at 
 the {Victoria and Albert Museum.}
