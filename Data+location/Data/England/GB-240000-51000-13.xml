		<content>{The Poron Factory.}                   
 The factory opened in 1964.During the 
 war the sites were used for gun       
 emplacements.Two factories were built 
 one either side of the road.In 1984   
 the lower factory was closed.This was 
 due to installing new machinery.The   
 modern automatic machines are 10 times
 faster than the old,so not so much    
 factory space was required.Each       
 machine costs approx Â£40,000 and one  
 man can operate 5 machines.The metal  
 moulds used on the machines to produce
 different shapes are made in Kent,to  
 the requirement of the customer.The   
 factory keeps about 300 moulds so they
 can produce items when the customer   
 requires.40 people are employed,39    
 full time,1 part time.75% are men and 
 25% women.10 (includes 1 part time)   
 are office and managment.The raw      
 materials come from Germany.          </content>
