 illustrated {"Masquerade"}which has   
 some  of his most famous paintings    
 inside.The task in {"Masquerade"}was  
 to follow clues given in the book to  
 find a golden hare which had          
 previously been buried. {Kit}thought  
 it would be found in about 2 weeks but
 it actually took 2 years.In his book  
 now known as {"The Bee on the Comb"   
 the task set  was to follow clues     
 which would lead to the book's        
 title.The prize,a golden bee.At school
 Kit knew he could paint but never took
 it seriously until he was older.
