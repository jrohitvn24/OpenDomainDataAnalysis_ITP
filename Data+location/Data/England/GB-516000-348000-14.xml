		<title>14Housing In South Kyme</title>
		<content>  Predominately 3 bedroomed semi-      
 detached houses, including several    
 Victorian houses with dog-toothed     
 brick course at eaves level, and      
 details picked out in contrasting     
 brickwork. Walls and roofs are        
 generally mellow in colour.           
  New building is tightly controlled by
 North Kesteven District Council. In   
 1980 the South Kyme Village Appraisal 
 was published, clarifying future      
 planning policies.                    
  Majority of homes have large gardens,
 many having been built as farmworkers 
 tied cottages. Some are now privately 
 owned, and a number are uninhabited,  
 due to fewer jobs on local farms.     
  Recently several new properties have 
 been built. 3 senior citizens bung-   
 alows were completed in 1984.  Almost 
 all homes have indoor bathrooms. Old  
 properties have been improved.        </content>
