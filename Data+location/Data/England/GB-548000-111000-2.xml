		<title>02LAUGHTON TRADITIONS</title>
		<content> Laughton has several traditions. Here 
 are some of them.                     
{Stoolball}is a traditional game in    
 Laughton and throughout Sussex. In    
 stoolball you have two white poles in 
 the ground with square boards on top. 
 The bowler bowls six times from the   
 middle of the posts; stoolball is very
 like cricket in some ways.            
 The{School Fete,}with games and       
 stalls, is held every year. My        
 favourite games are Pick-a-pot, the   
 Lemonade Wheel and the Coconut Shy.   
 Each year a different person opens the
 fete.                                 
{Maypole dancing}is held in both       
 Laughton and Ripe. Both villages have 
 a queen: there are four attendants and
 sixteen dancers.                      
 The proceeds from the{Village Fete}are
 shared between the Village Hall and   
 the Church.                           </content>
