		<title>12THE AVENUES,1.</title>
		<content> The housing of this area is of many   
 different styles. Many of the houses  
 are{Victorian}built in the early part 
 of this century. People who have      
 bought the houses  have modernised    
 them or restored them to their        
 original style. Many of them are large
 houses with four or more bedrooms. The
 rooms are spacious and have high      
 ceilings. Some are occupied by        
 families, others are split up into    
 flats for individual people. Many of  
 the houses are student houses where   
 people who are studying at{Hull}      
{University}live.                      
   {The Avenues,}as this area is known,
 is a conservation. There is a         
 Resident's Association which has a    
 committee that works to keep the area 
 in a good state of repair. A resident 
 pays 30p. a year to be a member.
