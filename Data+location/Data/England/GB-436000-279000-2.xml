		<title>02WALSGRAVE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Walsgrave is an historic village with 
 quite a few old cottages still left.As
 I live on the Mount Pleasant estate in
 Walsgrave I see some of these old     
 cottages every day when I walk to     
 school.St.Mary's church in Walsgrave  
 is very old and is one of the oldest  
 in Coventry.I live in a house which is
 about twenty years old.Before they    
 were built it would have been just    
 fields.There are still many fields    
 left close by.When my grandma was a   
 little girl,which was about seventy   
 years ago,there were hardly any houses
 at all in Walsgrave and she used to   
 come here for a day out in the        
 country.But now Walsgrave is most well
 known for its hospital which is one of
 the best in Britain.
