		<content> I live in Brixton                     
My house is a terraced house. It is    
very big. My house has a kichen,a      
sitting room and a living room on the  
first floor. On the second floor we    
have a bathroom, a toilet and two      
bedrooms. On the 3rd floor there are   
two bedrooms. I have 8 people in my    
house. My grandfather sleeps in one    
room on his own. My little brother     
sleeps with my dad and mum. My big     
brother has his own room and I have to 
sleep with my sister.I have lots of    
stairs in my house. My room is at the  
very top. Sometimes I play in my garden
and sometimes I go to the park. My mum 
is very worried when I go out to play  
but I find it very safe.I just have to 
walk 100 yds to get to the park.I dont 
have to walk too far to go to the      
shops.My doctor is very far from here. 
I have to take a bus to visit.         </content>
