		<content> In Dunmow there are 2 Doctor's        
 Practices,we visited the surgery at   
 Rood-End Dr Rawes helped us with our  
 research.The Doctor's surgery is open 
 mornings and evenings Monday-Friday   
 and on Saturday morning.In emergency  
 the Doctor will make home visits,the 2
 Practices share these calls.The       
 District Nurse and Health visitors    
 make rounds to check on new babies,the
 elderly and infirm.There are 3 Doctors
 and  nurses at the surgery,1 other    
 Doctor is based at Felsted.The Dental 
 Surgery is open each weekday.Doctors  
 and Dentists have treated people on   
 the National Health since 1948.It     
 costs children and O.A.P's nothing for
 medical and dental treatment.Adults   
 have to pay a prescription charge and 
 pay a contribution out of their wages.
 If you live outside the town you can  
 get your prescription from the surgery</content>
