		<content>         Our area consists mainly of a 
 small village, a school and the rest  
 of the area consists of farms.        
         Babcary is a small village    
 with a few houses, a pub, a church, a 
 Post Office and not much else as there
 is no mains drainage at the moment.   
         A few people live at          
 Hazlegrove House School permanently,  
 but most live elsewhere during the    
 holidays.                             
         Many of the farms are tenanted
 by a group of tenants and are close   
 together.                             
         Our area is about a           
 hundred metres above sea level and is 
 fairly flat on the whole,except in the
 south-east and the north-west. In the 
 south-east a hill gently rises and    
 Hazlegrove is here, and in the        
 north-west a hill rises more sharply  
 and Babcary is here.                  </content>
