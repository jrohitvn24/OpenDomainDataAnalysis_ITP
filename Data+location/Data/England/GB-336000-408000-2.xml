   Nearly all of the houses in this    
block are connected with agriculture,  
being farmhouses or built as cottages  
for labourers.  The names reflect the  
original owners, or the position they  
occupy, for example, New Cut Farm,     
Narrow Lane Farm..  One or two have    
changed their original purpose, for    
example, one farmhouse is now used as a
Kennels, a labourer's cottage is now   
used by a craftsman - an engraver.     
   One unusual sight was that of a set 
of 4 back-to-back cottages over 100    
years old, now in the process of being 
converted into two semi-detatched      
cottages, the shared back wall being   
removed. The back-to-back house is     
usually associated with development    
in industrial towns.
