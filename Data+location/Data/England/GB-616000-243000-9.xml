		<content> W.H.Smith, Westgate St.               
   W.H.Smith is situated in the centre 
of town. Again it contains mostly      
stationary but has other things for    
example books, computers, newspapers,  
folders, cards and electronic games .  
   The main attraction at the moment   
are computers, they range from small   
Sinclair ZX81's which are useful for   
home computing to big BBC computers    
which are better for business work .   
   W.H.Smith has just been enlarged .  
 Debenhams, Corn Hill.                 
    Debenhams is a department store .It

floor has jewellery, clothes and       
perfumes etc.The 1st floor contains    
mostly bedroom and lounge suites. The
