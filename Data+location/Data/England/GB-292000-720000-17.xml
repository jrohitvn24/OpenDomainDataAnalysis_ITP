		<content> On a farm in Madderty when the harvest
 is finished,they hold a{Harvest Home  
 party. The farmer,his workers and     
 their families have a big meal in the 
 farmhouse.    There is a{Harvest

 Guy for he top of the bonfire. The    
 fire is lit and fireworks are set off.
 We eat soup,crisps and baked potatoes.
 On Hogmanay,New Year's Eve people go  
{First-footing.}It is lucky to be first
 footed by a tall dark man.He should be
 the first person to cross over the    
 door after the bells have rung in the 
 New Year. Friends and relatives visit 
 each other and have a party from      
 midnight till the early morning.
