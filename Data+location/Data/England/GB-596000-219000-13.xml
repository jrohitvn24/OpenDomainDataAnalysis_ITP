		<content>{FRIDAYWOODS _}This is a popular       
 recreation area for local people. It  
 was once the forest of St.Johns Abbey 
 and is probably the only piece of     
 original forest left around           
 Colchester. It is an area of          
 outstanding natural history           
 archaeology and amenity value. Flora  
 and Fauna abound. Early morning in    
 spring the song of the Nightingales   
 can be deafening. Over 200 species of 
 butterfly including the rare Essex    
 Skipper have been recorded.           
{CHARLOTTE'S GROVE _ }planted in the   
 19th century by Sir George Smythe,then
 owner of Berechurch Hall,in memory of 
 his only daughter, Lady Charlotte who 
 died at the age of 33. There are many 
 local legends about the lady and her  
 haunted grotto behind Lethe Grove.
