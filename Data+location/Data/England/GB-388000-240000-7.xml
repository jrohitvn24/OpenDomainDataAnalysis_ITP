		<title>07TENANT FARMER, STRENSHAM.</title>
		<content> This good farmland seemed an          
 infallible investment for a large     
{insurance company}in 1982. Today, farm
 bankruptcies are increasing with small
 tenant farmers most vulnerable. The   
 comforting regularity of monthly milk 
 income (90 cows to 150 acres) is now  
 affected by cuts in{EEC quotas.}The   
 100 acres of wheat provides income    
 once a year with quotas likely in the 
 future. The farm supports three family
 members working long hours. The fourth
 works at the motorway services.       
 The{M5}cuts the farm in half with a   
 tunnel and cutting providing difficult
 access in bad weather. The farmer owns
 a good range of equipment, including  
 his car and pickup. The farm has mains
 water, electricity and telephone and  
 the nearby road systems are excellent.
 The local hunt is allowed on the land 
 for fox and mink.                     </content>
