		<title>15TWELVE,THE SQUARE,LEASINGHAM</title>
		<content> 12,The Square was built in 1650 and   
 was originally only the two downstairs
 but later an upstairs was built. It   
 had an old wash_room with a fire_place
 and an old boiler for washing clothes 
 and they are still there.There is an  
 outside toilet because they did not   
 have a bathroom.There is an old       
 pig_sty for keeping the pigs until    
 Sunday, when one would be killed and  
 eaten for Sunday dinner.There was an  
 old well some_where in the garden and 
 it is thought to be buried under the  
 long concrete path running downthe    
 right hand side of the garden.
