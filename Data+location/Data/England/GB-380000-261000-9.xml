 Most people live in houses with 2, 3  
 or 4 bedrooms. Mains gas is not       
 available so the majority   of cooking
 is done by means of electricity and a 
 smaller proportion by solid fuel or   
 liquid petroleum gas. Home life       
 generally  revolves around the garden 
 by day and the television set in the  
 evening for recreation. Some people   
 grow their own vegetables even though 
 in some instances gardens are quite   
 small. Many families own a domestic   
 deep freezer to store excess home     
 produced food and locally grown       
 produce  thus alleviating daily       
 shopping which is difficult without   
 own transport.Diet is traditional     
 English fare.
