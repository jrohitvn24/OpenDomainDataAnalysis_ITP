		<title>05DALE END PARK IRONBRIDGE</title>
		<content>    The park was the grounds of Dale   
 End House Coalbrookdale, which was    
 used as a police station before TDC   
 turned the area into a park. The area 
 is 6.25 hectares. The Grand Fir in    
 Dale End park is 40 metres high, it is
 the tallest tree in Telford. A rare   
 dragon fly, the club-tail, has been   
 found in the park.                    
    There is a camp site which Telford 
 Social Development Department own. The
 price for a night per adult is Â£1.00, 
 per child 50p. On June 12 1985 Dale   
 End Park will be walked as part of the
 Ramblers Association nationwide       
 JUBILEE WALK. The park warden looks   
 after the wild animals in the park, to
 make sure that they are not harmed.   
 Picnics in the park do not worry the  
 animals because they eat the picnic   
 scraps.
