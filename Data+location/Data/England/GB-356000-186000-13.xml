		<title>13Social Concerns</title>
		<content> The main concern of this area is the  
 motorway around and across the river  
 Severn. Before the present{Severn     
{Bridge}there was a ferry from {Aust}to
{Beachley.}When the plans for the      
 Severn Bridge and the motorway were   
 released people were generally against
 it because of the noise and it might  
 go through their land.Once it was     
 built people got used to it and they  
 began to see the good points of it.   
 The Severn Bridge, through lack of    
 finance has now deteriorated. There   
 are plans for a barrage futher down   
 stream, infact several different      
 plans. The other concern is the quarry
 being extended over peoples' land and 
 more rubbish tips in the area.  Groups
 of people have fought unsucessfully   
 against these plans.
