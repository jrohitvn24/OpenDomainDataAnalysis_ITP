		<title>13POOLSIDE FARM</title>
		<content>                                       
  Mr.Bedson lives at Poolside Farm in  
Madeley. He came to live there 33 years
ago. Before that the farm belonged to  
his uncle Fred Bedson. At one time the 
farm was 95 acres in size, but some of 
the land was sold to build houses on,  
and now there are only 75 acres left.  
  On the front of the farmhouse there  
is  carved a sign showing a clenched   
fist through a crown. This is the      
symbol that means that the place was   
once owned by Lord Crewe.              
  Mr.Bedson doesn't like moles. He lays
traps for them under the ground, and he
has got nine moles hanging on some     
barbed wire by their noses.            
  Apart from the house (which is dated 
1855), he has a small stable which used
to be a pigsty. In the backyard there's
an old shed where some Polish airmen   
supposedly hid during the war.         </content>
