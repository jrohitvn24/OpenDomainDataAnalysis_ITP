		<content> An important area in Sheffield is     
 Bramall Lane football ground. Football
 is extremely popular in Sheffield.    
 Usually there is no trouble but       
 occasionally disturbances occur, which
 damage the area.                      
 Our city also boasts one of the best  
 art centres outside London. Leadmill  
 is an old stable. Here you can find   
 rock groups, fringe theatre, jazz,    
 dance and art workshops.              
 We asked 50 people for their opinion  
 about behaviour at football matches.  
 27% said that players' behaviour      
 contributed to the hooliganism, but   
 55% said not. 95%, of the people      
 asked,felt that alcohol should not be 
 sold at matches.55% felt that         
 membership cards were a good idea,33% 
 disagreed,11% did not know.
