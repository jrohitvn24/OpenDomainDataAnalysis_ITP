		<title>12BULLCROFT COLLIERY</title>
		<content>  The Bullcroft Colliery Company       
 was formed in 1908.The sinking of the 
 two shafts commenced in 1909 and they 
 were completed by November, 1911.The  
 Barnsley seam of coal was reached at  
 662 yards below the surface. The      
 method of working the coal was by     
 long-wall advancing faces.The total   
 length of underground tunnels         
 necessary to service the working faces
 was about 30 miles. When the Coal     
 Board took over there were 1300       
 underground and 350 working on the    
 surface.The colliery was closed for   
 coal production in September, 1970 and
 demolition of the surface was finally 
 completed in 1974.The reason for      
 demolition was it was cheaper to work 
 remaining coal from Brodsworth        
 Colliery.The pit tip has been         
 reclaimed and grassed is used for     
 grazing cattle.                       </content>
