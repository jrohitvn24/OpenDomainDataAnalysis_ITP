		<content> I go to a Brownie pack in Alcester we 
 are called the 1st Alcester pack.     
          We meet every Tuesday at 6.30
 pm and finish at 7.30 pm. During that 
 time we play games and work for       
 badges.                               
         Brownies was founded by Lord  
 Baden Powell's wife.                  
         We have a Brownie handbook    
 which tells us about the badges and   
 other things. Some of the badges we   
 work for are first aid, agility,      
 artist, swimmer, skater, collectors,  
 jester, safety in the home, house     
 orderly, hostess, reader, pet lover,  
 writer and athelete.                  
         We wear a uniform which       
 consists of a yellow tie with a silver
 trefoil on, a brown hat with a bobble 
 on, a brown belt and a brown dress.   
         When you are ten or eleven you
 go up to Guides.                      </content>
