		<title>05THE WOOLPIT LORRY PARK</title>
		<content> My Dad worked at the lorry park,      
 Leggetts Transport. They made a new   
 lorry park near the A45.  There are   
 more lorries than there used to be. My
 Dad thinks there are 50 lorries. I    
 went in the lorry with my Dad and     
 sometimes my Mum came too. We ate our 
 sandwiches in the lorry. The lorries  
 carry bricks and sugar and they go all
 over Britain. The drivers mostly live 
 in Elmswell, Woolpit and Drinkstone.  
 We saw 18 cars parked in the yard, 15 
 lorries and 10 trailers. At the park  
 they have a mechanics' workshop. They 
 have a breakdown service. At night    
 they have guard dogs on patrol. There 
 is a high fence all around the lorry  
 park.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
