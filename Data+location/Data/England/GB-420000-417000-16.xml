		<content> .With the development of man made     
 fibres and cheap imported textiles the
 woollen trade went into decline. Old  
 mills were often taken over by the    
 expanding engineering industry        
 "British Cotton Spinners" became      
 "Fletcher Filtration".Some mills were 
 used by several firms as happened at  
 premises owned by "Lyles Ltd." Other  
 mill buildings have had several uses  
 and are now used by many very small   
 firms as happened at the "Low Mills"  
 which were owned by "Lee Nephew and   
 Sons Ltd." These old premises built   
 on the island formed by the river and 
 the canal are used by a cricket bat   
 maker,a sheet metal worker,a joiner,a 
 motor mechanic, a builder,a painter,a 
 textile waste firm,a caravan servicing
 firm,a waste paper merchant,2 firms of
 joiners and builders,an upholsterer   
 plus several more firms.              </content>
