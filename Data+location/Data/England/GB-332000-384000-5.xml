		<content> No one was allowed on the grass bank  
 of the school playground.  One time   
 a ball went on to the bank, and       
 because I was so tall I stretched out 
 to get it and the bank monitors       
 caught me and I went to have the cane.
{ In the war}we would have to leave our
 classes and go to the{shelters}below  
 the school which were sandbags all the
 way up. There was a little door to go 
 through to get in, a house was bombed 
 a way from school.  We went visiting  
 American soldiers at the docks, and we
 used to say,{"Any gum chum?" }The hall
 on a Sunday was used for{Sunday School
 it was run by{Christ Church,}which was
 next to the school. The superintendant
 was called{Soapy Joe. }When we went   
 home we would listen to a programme   
 called{'Children's Hour'.  In 1941 I  
{was evacuated}to North Wales. I came  
 back after the war.                   </content>
