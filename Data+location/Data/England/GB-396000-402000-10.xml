		<title>10WHIT FRIDAY BAND CONTESTS</title>
		<content>     Whit Friday is a local Holiday.   
 All the Churches in the area hold a   
 procession of witness in the morning. 
 Each church engages a {Brass Band}to  
 lead their procession.                
     As there are a good many bands in 
 the valley on this day, open-air {Band
{contests}are held  in all the towns &amp; 
 villages down the valley.In 1985 there
 were no less than 15 contests with    
 over 100 bands taking part. Five of   
 the contests are in this block.       
     The Bands are adjudicated on two  
 performances. The first being a short 
 street march where deportment only is 
 judged. In the second &amp; main event,   
 the band stand &amp; play a quick step    
 march &amp; points are awarded for musical
 ability. As the contests are spread   
 along the valley each band hires a    
 coach to transport them from contest  
 to contest.                           </content>
