		<title>11LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> From photos dating back to the early  
 1800's we can see Hythe was similar to
 Hythe today but The Marsh and the High
 Street were large dirt tracks and most
 of the traffic was horses and carts   
 and pedestrians. Hythe has a lot of   
 new buildings including a string of   
 shops all owned by the company Hythe  
 Electronics. This company is doing    
 very well in Hythe. There are 3       
 cottages that were extremely run down 
 and eventually became derelict, the   
 eyesore of Hythe, and unless someone  
 bought them they would have been      
 demolished. A young couple, Mr &amp; Mrs  
 Shanks did buy them and do them up to 
 save Hythe's history. There is a      
 Victorian Pier in Hythe. It was       
 started in 1879 and completed about 2 
 years later. Before the pier, a small 
 rowing boat crossed to Southampton,   
 but the ladies got dirty on the mud.  </content>
