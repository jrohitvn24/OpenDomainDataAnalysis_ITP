		<title>12Two Ombersley Shops</title>
		<content>{THE GALLERIES.}The lady who owned The 
 Galleries  told us about her craft    
 shop and tea rooms. It became a shop  
 in 1945 and was first a grocers then a
 bakers. The tea room attached used to 
 be a priest's house and is very old.We
 noted some prices: a picture cost Â£50,
 a china thimble Â£21 and an embroidered
 cushion Â£50. People come to shop from 
 a 40 mile radius. It is closed on     
 Sundays and Mondays.                  
{T.H.CHECKETTS.}Most people who shop at
 T.H.Checketts, the butcher, come from 
 Ombersley.The business was established
 in 1830 and has been owned by         
 Checketts since 1925.The most popular 
 meat sold is beef.These are some of   
 their prices:chicken,89p per lb,lamb's
 liver 99p per lb,mince Â£1.35 per      
 lb,pork sausages,84p per lb.The       
 busiest day is Friday because people  
 buy their meat for the weekend.       </content>
