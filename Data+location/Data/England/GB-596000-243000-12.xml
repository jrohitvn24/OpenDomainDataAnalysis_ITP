		<title>12HOUSING</title>
		<content>The housing consists in part of the    
'original' timber, wattle and daub,    
usually painted white,cream or a shade 
of pink.  There is some thatch, usually
covered in wire netting to preserve it 
against the birds.  There is 'Tudor'   
brick in the area and some of the      
houses have ovens of about that date.  
Some are mediaeval halls that have been
divided into two storeys and have beams
at knee height in bedrooms.            
There are houses which were built when 
the railways brought brick to the area.
They have Welsh slates.  Building is   
limited to occasional high quality new 
houses.  Much renovation, renewal and  
extending is done as the area becomes  
more expensive and select.  Two or more
cottages are frequently knocked into   
one, limiting the inexpensive housing  
stock.
