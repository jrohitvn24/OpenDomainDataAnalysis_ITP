 saw-mill &amp; joiners &amp; it employs a     
 number of local people.{The majority

 There are several self-employed       
 people, mainly in the building trade  
 One family breeds rabbits which       
 provides employment for the father &amp;  
 two sons. There is also a taxi firm in
 the area and a number of people       
 operate businesses from their houses. 
  {Unemployment}is not a real problem  
 in this area though some              
 school-leavers have difficulty in     
 obtaining jobs &amp; often have to be     
 prepared to move out of the villages  
 or to{commute}to London or the larger 
 surrounding towns.
