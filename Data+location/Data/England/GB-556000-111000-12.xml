		<content> On the {Domesday}project my form went 
 to{Hellingly}village. We were split   
 into four groups. The first week my   
 group went to {Hellingly Village      
{Church}St.Peters, St.Pauls. The first 
 recorder vicar there was in the       
 twelfth century, I cannot remember his
 name though. The pews in the church   
 have recently been renewed and I don't
 think the fit very well in the church.
 On the right hand side of the knave   
 there is an iron tomb in the shape of 
 a small woman which was only uncovered
 recently but did not have any remains 
 in it. Outside there is a large       
 gravelyard which surrounds the church.
 I think it must look very sinister at 
 night, but I think it is very pretty  
 by day. I enjoyed my visit to{
