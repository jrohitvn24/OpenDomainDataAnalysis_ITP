		<title>08Employment of Sydling People</title>
		<content> About 80 people of the village are in 
 paid employment.  The most prominent  
 occupations are in the professional   
 or scientific services and in         
 agriculture. Most people drive them-  
 selves to work.                       
 There are 15 self  employed people in 
 the village and most work in Sydling  
 or in close  proximity.  Most people  
 agree that there should be more jobs  
 available in the village.  Suggested  
 employment includes rural crafts such 
 as hedge laying, thatching,  plumbing,
 decorating, carpentry, pottery,       
 furniture making, gardening and motor 
 maintenance.  It was also felt that   
 there should be no concentration of   
 buildings for industry, rather        
 workshops using small amounts of land 
 suitable for individual craftsmen.
