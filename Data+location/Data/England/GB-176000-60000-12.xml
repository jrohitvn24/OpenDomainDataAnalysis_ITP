		<title>12FARMS AROUND CRANTOCK</title>
		<content> There are 3 farms in our area and all 
 have Camping facilities. {Treago Farm 
 grows mainly corn which is stored in  
 corn bins.  These are large cylinders 
 made of metal about 8 metres high and 
 5 metres wide.{Trevella Farm}and      
{Penpol}are both dairy farms and keep  
 cows and bulls.  The size of a farm is
 measured in acres and we found out    
 that Trevella is 460 acres.  All 3    
 farms have proper Cornish hedges which
 separate the fields.  These high      
 hedges are made of stone and earth,   
 topped with turf and are wider at the 
 base than at the top.  Many of them   
 have stood for centuries.  Machines   
 are common on these farms; corn       
 driers, corn crushers and tractors    
 which are used for pulling and power- 
 ing machinery and general transport   
 around the farm.
