 Wednesday June 12 1985                
 __________________________            
 In one half hour this evening around 4
 p.m.one and a half inches of rain fell
 on Maldon causing flash floods.There  
 was much flooding in the town itself- 
 factories,houses and schools were feet
 under water.Because Maldon is on a    
 hill water gushed from the higher area
 to low lying areas cutting off roads  
 to surrounding villages.Most of the   
 traffic was at a standstill.Fire brig-
 ades from nearby towns helped with    
 mopping up.                           
   Our own school St Francis was affec-
 ted-the road and path was two feet    
 under water but no water entered the  
 building.Now,however,a month later the
 beautiful parquet flooring in the hall
 has lifted up.This is probably due to 
 the water not draining away properly. </content>
