		<content> The farms in our area are{Bell Farm,  
{Berry Farm}and{Stoke Farm.} Bell Farm 
 is a{poultry}farm.  Berry Farm keeps  
 stables for other people's{horses}and 
 a few hens, chickens etc..  Neither of
 these farms grow crops.  The land at  
 Berry Farm is used for the horses to  
 graze on.  Some of the fields at Bell 
 Farm are used for the{cows}of another 
 farm to graze on.  Bell Farm and Berry
 Farm are close together and know each 
 other.  A majority of the land in our 
 area is used for grazing cattle and   
 horses.                               
      A few years ago Bell Farm sold   
 part of their land to a{property}     
{developer.} This land was eventually  
 used to enlarge the land used by      
 Wexham Park Golf Club.
