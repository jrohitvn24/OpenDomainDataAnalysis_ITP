 The people that we interviewed feel   
 that in the last five years{Mawgan    
 has not changed much except that a few
 new house's have been built.It is     
 believed that the village is not as   
 pretty as it used to be but regular   
 holiday makers don't seem to notice   
 the difference.The{shop}is open from  
 9am to 6pm but the shopkeeper works   
 from 7am to 7pm with an hour for lunch
 if she's lucky.The villager's get up  
 surpriseingly early considering there 
 is not any traffic or machinary to    
 disturb them.There are a few group    
 activitie's such as a{friendship      
{group,woman's institute}and a{coffee  
{morning}for children and parent's     
 surprisingly the children of the      
 village like to visit the older       
 people.                               </content>
