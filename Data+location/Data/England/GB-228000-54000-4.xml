		<content> The farm settlements have remained    
 unexpanded.The villages demonstrate   
 phases of expansion.Much of the early 
 farm based village remains as private 
 housing.The great enlargement of the  
{1880}is recognised by the tall        
 sometimes multistory semidetached and 
 terraced houses.After{1920}some       
 sustantial bungalows of sea-sand block
 were built. Two terraces of Council   
 housing are still prominent.Less      
 durable holiday homes in timber and   
 asbestos were built in and near       
 Seaton.These are presently being      
 renovated to 1985 standards.          
 Wartime requirements{1939}caused much 
 construction in the village to service
 a large R.A.F. radio location station.
 Postwar these structures were adapted 
 to form the first homes of many new   
 and newly married families who are now
 the backbone of the villages.         </content>
