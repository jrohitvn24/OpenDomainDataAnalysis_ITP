		<content>   The area is South West of Wakefield 
 and includes HORBURY,SOUTH            
 OSSETT,HORBURY BRIDGE and LUPSET.     
   The River Calder runs through the   
 valley and this fact greatly          
 influenced the areas early            
 development.                          
   The M1 motorway has played a similar
 role in its more recent development.  
   The area has some industry and      
 farming but is mainly residential     
 serving the larger nearby cities.     
   The area is rich in history and owes
 its early beginings to the textile    
 industry.                             
    There are a number of noteable     
 historic buildings.                   
    Leisure activities are well catered
 for many different forms of clubs     
 exist for both young and old.
