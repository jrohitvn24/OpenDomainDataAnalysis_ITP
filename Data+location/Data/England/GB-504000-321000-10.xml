		<content> The organ has been repaired.The vicar 
 held a service and after the service  
 there was a barbeque.The Church has   
 two new bells in memory of Lord       
 Ancaster.They were engraved.We went   
 round to see the bells.They were hung 
 up in May.When you touch you get a    
 silvery effect on your hand.In March  
 there was a flag pole put up.Some of  
 us saw the flag pole being put up at  
 the side of the Church.The men nearly 
 dropped it from the top of the tower  
 but they finally got it up.When we got
 the bells the flag was flying in      
 memory of Lord Ancaster.It was flying 
 at half mast.Across the road from the 
 School,some new steps have been       
 built.It is to help anyone who wants  
 to put a notice on the Parish notice  
 board.A garden fete was held on the   
 lawn of Peter Bee's house.The village 
 hall was recently decorated.          </content>
