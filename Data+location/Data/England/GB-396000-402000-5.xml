		<content>  This landmark dominates the landscape
 from all angles. It is situated about 
 282 metres above sea level surveying  
 the old counties of Lancashire,       
 Yorkshire, Cheshire and Derbyshire. On
 a clear day, there is a breath-taking 
 view over the Cheshire Plain to the   
 Welsh Mountains in the distance.      
  Originally a {ROMAN FIRE BEACON      
 it became a lookout post garrisoned by
 the Home Guard during the Second World
 War. Recently it has been sand        
 blasted but the windows and door have 
 been bricked up to prevent vandalism. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
 A pilot using a visual method of      
 approach to Manchester International  
 Airport would use {HARTSHEAD PIKE }   
 as a prominent landmark.
