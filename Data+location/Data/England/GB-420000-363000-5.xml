		<content> Sometimes we use some hard maize. For 
 the sky we use blue petals. For the   
 trees we use green holly leaves. We   
 use lots of different kinds of leaves 
 from trees.                           
 We soak the base-boards in the River  
 Bradford for several weeks and we soak
 the clay too. When we take them out of
 the river we spread the soft clay on  
 the base-board. A Bible picture is    
 pricked out on the clay from a pattern
 drawn by someone in the village. We   
 stick the flowers into the clay.      
 On the nearest Saturday to St. John   
 the Baptist's Day (June 24th.), at    
 five o'clock in the morning, we put   
 the well dressings up. They are about 
 2 metres tall and 1 metre wide. Lots  
 of people come to the village to see  
 the well dressings, so it is a very   
 exciting week in the village.
