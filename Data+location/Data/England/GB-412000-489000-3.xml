 JOBS BETTER AND FASTER AND NEED FEWER 
 PEOPLE TO OPERATE THEM.MOST FARMERS   
 USE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY.CHEMICAL    
 FERTILIZERS AND SPRAYS ALSO HELP THE  
 FARMER TO INCREASE HIS YIELD.MEDICINES
 HAVE IMPROVED ANIMAL HUSBANDRY.EVEN   
 COMPUTERS ARE USED TO ASSIST FARMING  
 PRODUCTION.FARMING IS THE MAIN        
 BUSINESS ACTIVITY.

 COTTAGES,CARAVAN SITES AND            
 ACCOMODATION. OTHER BUSNESESS INCLUDE 
 TWO SCRAP YARDS.APART FROM FARMING
