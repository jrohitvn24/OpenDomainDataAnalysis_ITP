 Sutton is a villageto which a lot of  
 people retire.It is also a holiday    
 resort.It gets very busy around June. 
 We have a permanent population of     
 about 1900 but there are lots of      
 houses which are mainly holiday       
 homes.We have one main street of      
 shops.There are some houses that were 
 especially built for old people.We    
 have a nice beach which is covered in 
 sand but sometimes gets stones and    
 pebbles washed up.Sutton is   a nice  
 place to live.                        </content>
