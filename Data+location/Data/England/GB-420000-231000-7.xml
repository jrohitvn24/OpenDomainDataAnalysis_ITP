		<title>07MORETON- CLINICS AND CHEMIST</title>
		<content> There is one{hospital}in Moreton.     
 There we spoke to a sister and a      
 health visitor about the baby{clinic.}
 About 50 babies are visited each year 
 and they all have their injections at 
 the clinic. There are other clinics   
 where doctors can send a patient to   
 see a specialist. There is an         
{optician}in Moreton who supplies and  
 mends glasses and tests eyes.         
 There is a{chemist}shop and the owner 
 emphasised its importance in Moreton. 
 The{chemist}dispenses about 2,000     
 prescriptions a month. If someone     
 comes to the shop who the chemist     
 thinks is too ill he will send them to
 a doctor. He has to supervise all the 
 time the{chemist's}shop is open.The   
 chemist sells{health foods}which are a
 very important part of his trading as 
 people are looking for alternative    
 ways of staying well.                 </content>
