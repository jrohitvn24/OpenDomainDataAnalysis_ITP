		<title>19NATURAL HISTORY OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> THERE IS A NICE ECOLOGICAL BALANCE IN 
 THIS REGION, WITH MANY NATURAL        
 HABITATS SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF   
 FLORA AND FAUNA. POPULAR WILD PLANTS  
 INCLUDE THE STINGING NETTLE, BRAMBLE, 
 ELDER FLOWER (AND BERRIES) AND WILD   
 ROSES.  MANY OF THESE ARE USED BY THE 
 COUNTRY PEOPLE TO MAKE PRESERVES AND  
 DELICIOUS WINES. ELDERFLOWER CHAMPAGNE
 IS A PARTICULAR FAVOURITE IN MANY     
 HOUSEHOLDS AND IS VERY SIMPLE TO MAKE 
 FROM A FEW FLOWER HEADS, SUGAR, YEAST 
 AND WATER. LOCAL WILDLIFE INCLUDES    
 MANY SPECIES OF BIRDS AND PIGEONS,    
 MICE, RATS, HEDGEHOGS, MOLES, VOLES,  
 RABBITS, FOXES AND SQUIRRELS. THE     
 BANKS OF THE RESERVOIR HOUSE MANY RARE
 DUCKS WHICH THRIVE BECAUSE OF THE LACK
 OF POLLUTION. FOOTPATHS ABOUND WITHIN 
 THIS AREA AROUND SPINNEYS AND SMALL   
 WOODS, ALSO THE RESERVOIR. CLIMATE IS 
 VERY PLEASANT, WITH FEW EXTREMES.     </content>
