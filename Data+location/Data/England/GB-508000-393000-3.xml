		<content> Being a predominantly agricultural    
 area there is little obvious          
 industrial pollution although some    
 concern has been expressed over the   
 emissions from the power stations in  
 the Trent Valley 25 miles away.       
 There are a wide range of wild flowers
 and plants growing in the area as     
 well as wild animals. In general      
 local farmers maintain hedges and     
 woodland well and there appears to be 
 an awareness of the importance of     
 conservation with the exception of    
 the Viking Way footpath the others in 
 the area are little used and poorly   
 kept. The major part of the territory 
 is sheltered from northerly and       
 easterly winds by the Lincolnshire    
 wolds. There is often a marked        
 difference in temperature between the 
 lowland areas and the more exposed    
 higher land.                          </content>
