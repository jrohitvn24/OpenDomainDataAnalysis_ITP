		<title>14CHILDREN'S GAMES CHELMARSH</title>
		<content> I sometimes play games with my        
 friend.We play things like bull dog   
 and stampede.These games are played on
 the playground and you have to get    
 from one end to the other without     
 getting caught by the person who is   
 on.                                   
     We play tennis with the tennis    
 rackets and a ball and these are      
 supplied by the school.               
     We have got 6 swings and a slide  
 on our school playing field.It is not 
 the school's all the time because it  
 is rented off the Parish council.     
     We have got a tree where children 
 play dens in.                         
     Children do lots of running on the
 running track.We also play            
 football,netball,rounders, cricket and
 cross country running.
