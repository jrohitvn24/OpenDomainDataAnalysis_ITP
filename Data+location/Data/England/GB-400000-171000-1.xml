		<title>01 CALNE - NORTH WEST AREA</title>
		<content> Our block is mainly a farming area on 
 the edge of Calne. This area of Calne 
 is mainly a housing estate. There are 
 many gardens and lots of grass.{The   
{Abberd Brook runs through the estate  
{and joins the River Marden at Doctor's
{Pond. This is where Joseph Priestley  
{is said to have discovered oxygen.}Our
 school is named after him. There is   
 also a growing industrial estate with 
 new roads and factories being built.  
 Most of the area is farmland. It is   
 mainly arable with some dairying too. 
 There are sandpits in our block and   
 the gravel lorries drive through the  
 estate with the sand. The village of  
 Compton Bassett is on the edge of our 
 block. About 300 people live there in 
 old cottages. Most of the people who  
 live there are quite old and have     
 lived there all their lives.{
