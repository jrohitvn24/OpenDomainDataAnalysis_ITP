		<title>13Housing in Upottery</title>
		<content>{Upottery and Rawridge}are the two main
 housing areas as most others are      
 isolated farms and cottages.          
  We surveyed the houses in the two    
 villages to find the types of houses  
 and the materials used.               
 The oldest houses were made with      
{stone}or{cob}for the{walls}and        
{thatched}roofs.Sometimes houses have a
 new roof instead of the thatch or it  
 is covered with corrugated metal      
 sheets. Later{stone buildings}have    
{slate roofs}and some of these have    
 been replaced with modern asbestos    
 slates.Two houses had roofs made of   
{wooden shingles.}The{new houses}and   
{bungalows}of{block}with{slate}or{tile 
 roofs are{detached or semi_detached   
 mainly but there are{link}or{terraced 
 houses near Upottery School.One new   
 house is made of blocks with an outer 
 layer of stone to blend with others.  </content>
