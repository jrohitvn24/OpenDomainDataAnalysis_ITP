		<title>07Village Hall</title>
		<content>The village hall was built in 1972 and 
plays an important role in the life of 
the local community. The building is   
located at the centre of the village,  
alongside the main road and close to   
the primary school. It contains the    
branch library, a kitchen and floor    
space large enough for over 300 people.
It can be hired at #2 per hour and can 
be used at any time until midnight. The
hall is in full use throughout the year
except during August when most people  
are on holiday. Here is a list of      
regular activities held in the hall.
