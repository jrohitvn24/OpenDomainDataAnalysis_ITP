		<content>  It was Christmas. My sister woke me  
 up and we talked.At 7.30am we         
 collected our presents and went to    
 mum's room. We both unwrapped our     
 presents and went downstairs and had  
 breakfast.Mum,Dad and little sister   
 unwrapped their presents. We got      
 dressed and drove to my Nanna's home. 
  When we arrived, Nanna and Grandad   
 were in the kitchen and my Aunt and   
 Uncle were in the living room.We sat  
 down and talked while Nanna made the  
 dinner.                               
  At 1 o'clock nine of us had dinner   
 and in the afternoon we watched some  
 films on TV.                          
  We had tea and then my Uncle took    
 Aunty home at about 6pm. At 6.30 my   
 family and I went home. When we got   
 there,we went to Michelle's home for a
 drink.
