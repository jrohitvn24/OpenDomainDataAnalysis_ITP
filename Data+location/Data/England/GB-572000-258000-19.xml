		<content> 1 or 2 new varieties of animals have  
 appeared in the wild state, such as   
 mink, escaping from mink farms.       
 Rabbits are becominmg more numerous,  
 also the mole. Some farmers preserve a
 small acreage for wildlife as         
 spinneys. Hares are found here, also  
 fallow deer, badgers, foxes, hedgehogs
 rats, mice, voles, stoat and weasels. 
 Birds of prey include kestrels, little
 owl, tawny owl, barn owl, crow,       
 magpie, jackdaw. Many migrating birds 
 come over East Anglia to the delight  
 of the many birdwatchers, but the     
 nesting places of the rarer birds is  
 kept secret for fear of egg stealing. 
 All in all, the countryside here is a 
 delight for wildlife. Where else can  
 you see partridges, pheasants, all    
 sorts of finches, the rare fieldfares,
 woodpecker, robin, wren and many other
 animals from your kitchen window.     </content>
