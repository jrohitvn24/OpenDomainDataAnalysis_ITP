		<content> We carried out a small survey to try  
 to find out how people spent their    
 leisure time.                         
 In the villages there are few         
 facilities apart from the public      
 houses and schools which can act as   
 centres. However there seemed to be   
 several clubs and societies which had 
 a fluctuating membership and length of
 life. Most facilities were in Norwich 
 but some were centred in Long Stratton
 and Wymondham.                        
 Most of the leisure pursuits were     
 sports of different kinds, although   
 some were more cultural including     
 theatre, amateur drama, keeping       
 animals, reading, cinema, hobbies such
 as stamp collecting, woodworking,     
 etc.. Disturbingly, many people said  
 either television or doing nothing.
