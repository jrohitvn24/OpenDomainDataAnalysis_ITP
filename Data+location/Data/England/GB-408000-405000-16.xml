		<title>16Tourism - Local concern.</title>
		<content> The BBC series "Last of the Summer    
 Wine" is filmed in the Holmfirth area.
 Holme village and the areas around the
 reservoirs have also been used as     
 locations. Public interest in the     
 programme has meant a huge increase in
 tourism.                              
  Coaches and carloads from all over   
 the country travel to Holmfirth, many 
 using the route over Holme Moss and   
 through Holme village.                
  This has greatly increased the       
 traffic making the main road through  
 the village very busy.                
  "Holme Castle" is a small hotel      
 standing at the edge of Holme village.
 The increase in tourists has resulted 
 in new extensions being built and a   
 number of houses in the village now   
 offer "Bed and Breakfast".            
  Local people are very concerned over 
 this invasion.                        </content>
