		<content> Twenty four pre_school children (17   
 boys and 7 girls) go to the playgroup 
 each weekday morning from 0915 to     
 1215.The group meets in the hall      
 behind St.Richard's church and it     
 costs 95p per child each day.Four     
 adults look after the children and    
 encourage them in pre_reading and     
 number skills. For example,each       
 child's name is printed above its     
 coat peg to help the children         
 recognise their own name.During the   
 morning the children have milk and a  
 biscuit.They take turns to count how  
 many cups of milk and biscuits are    
 needed.There are many toys to play    
 with such as jigsaw puzzles,lego      
 building bricks,4 or 5 tricycles,a    
 rocking horse,model cars and a model  
 garage.The children also enjoy        
 painting pictures.
