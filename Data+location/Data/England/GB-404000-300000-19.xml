		<content> We surveyed 11 year olds to find how  
 they spent their freetime. The most   
 popular occupation was watching       
 television. Some children go to Scouts
 or Guides where they enjoy organised  
 games and the opportunity to become a 
 Queen's Scout or Guide, the highest   
 honour they could achieve. Many       
 people, mainly boys enjoy fishing, the
 country's largest participant sport.  
 Some go by themselves, others travel  
 further afield with fathers or other  
 adults. A lot of children play musical
 instruments. Sport is particularly    
 popular with boys, who can play       
 football or cricket on any piece of   
 open ground as long as there are at   
 least 2 players! Smaller groups enjoy 
 reading, gymnastics, trampolining,    
 drawing and painting. Most enjoy just 
 "playing out"!
