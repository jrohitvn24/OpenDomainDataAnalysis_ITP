		<title>16SHEEP IN HOOK GRAVEYARD</title>
		<content> This summer has seen considerable     
 local comment on sheep being used to  
 trim grass in the village graveyard.  
 The story has been in both local and  
 national newspapers and there have    
 been heated interviews on radio and   
 television.The sheep were moved into  
 the churchyard by the Parochial Church
 Council. Many villagers have said the 
 sheep have damaged graves and eaten   
 flowers.Mr Don Graham,whose family has
 lived in Hook for over 30 years, and  
 has his father buried there has       
 threatened to take the matter to the  
 Bishop of Winchester.Eventually the   
 sheep were moved out but churchwarden 
 Mr John Morgan has hinted they may be 
 brought back next year as they were a 
 cheap way to keep the grass down.Since
 the arrival of the sheep numbers of   
 tended graves have apparently gone up 
 from 5 to 23!                         </content>
