		<content> This block lies just inland from the  
 South Dorset coast.An area of rolling 
 countryside it has superb views from  
 the hilltops of the surrounding area. 
 A rural area,it is largely            
 agricultural although in the South    
 East corner there is,for these parts,a
 large cluster of buildings which forms
 the Royal Armoured Corps Gunnery      
 School at Lulworth Camp.              
 It is an Area of Outstanding Natural  
 Beauty with woodland,rough pasture and
 arable land.                          
 Only two roads can be found,both      
 running North/South within the        
 block.One skirts Marley Wood and leads
 to Daggers Gate,the other forms part  
 of the road from the coast to Wool.   
 Walking to other parts on footpaths   
 and bridleways one is aware of an     
 abundance of wildlife,which flourishes
 largely undisturbed.                  </content>
