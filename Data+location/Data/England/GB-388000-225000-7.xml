		<title>07Canal:Conflict In Use.</title>
		<content>  Mr.Pitkin had hoped to restore the   
 Canal and make it work properly.This  
 would have cost a great deal.A Canal  
 Trust was set up to finance the       
 clearance + repairs of the project.   
 Mr.Pitkin wanted to run educational + 
 pleasure trips on the Canal when it   
 was restored.                         
          The Canal was partially      
 cleared.This destroyed much of the    
 wildlife + disturbed the habitat of   
 many wild animals.Local people,who    
 lived near the end of the Canal also  
 began to object about the disturbance 
 the renovation made.                  
          In June 1985 the Canal Trust 
 decided to abandon the plans for      
 renovation because it was so expensive
 They sold the Canal to the            
 Gloucestershire Conservation Society, 
 who plan to make the Canal into a     
 nature resort.                        </content>
