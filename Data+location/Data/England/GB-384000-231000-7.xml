 This small part of England is still   
 so dominated by the local manor that  
 there is a great deal of feeling and  
 opinion related to very local issues. 
 The  Forthampton Court has always been
 an important integral part of the life
 of the people and this is changing    
 only very slowly.                     
 Apart from owning most of the land and
 many of the houses, the Yorke family  
 were responsible for the church and   
 even the routes taken by some of the  
 roads. They also built the current    
 working men's club (there is no public
 house in the village).                
 It is probably this hold by the       
 Yorke's which has helped to prevent   
 the area being destroyed by new       
 developments such as housing estates. 
 It has also had an effect on local    
 employment.                           </content>
