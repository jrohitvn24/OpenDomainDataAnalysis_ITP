		<title>14LOCAL HISTORY  W'B'NE VALLEY</title>
		<content>     This  area  rich  in   prehistoric
 monuments, especially Bronze Age round
 barrows or tumuli.    They are on high
 ground for example on the upper slopes
 of Bronkham Hill  and Rew Hill.   Many
 more  have  been  almost  flattened by
 ploughing. There are several neolithic
 long barrows.   There are very clearly
 defined  sets   of   medieval    strip
 lynchets;    long    narrow   terraces
 arranged in flights on the hill sides,
 especially  on the  south side  of the
 Winterbourne valley and  south-west of
 Steepleton village.  Hardy Monument is
 a  stone  tower  built  in  1844  as a
 viewpoint in memory of  Admiral Hardy.
 The  Church  of St.Michael  is  mainly
 medieval with modern additions.  Built
 in to the exterior of the  south wall,
 a  flying angel  is  carved in a stone
 block, generally believed to be Saxon.
