		<title>03   MY DAY    2.EVENING</title>
		<content> When school is finished I walk home   
 for my tea.Tuesday is my favourite day
 because I do lots of activities.After 
 my tea I walk to the{Sports Centre}.  
 At the Sports Centre I play badminton 
 for 45 minutes,after that I go        
 swimming in the swimming pool for an  
 hour.When I come out I walk up to the 
 school for our{activity club}.When I  
 get there I go into the hall where I  
 am given a choice of what to do. There
 is a wide range of activities. We play
 small board games,table tennis,       
 computer games,pool or knitting. I    
 usually play table tennis or computer 
 games. There are also refreshments    
 like bottles of pop and sweets. At    
 7.30 we have a disco for half an hour 
 until I go home.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
