		<content> Little Weighton,in the Parish of      
 Rowley,is a small rural village.The   
 nearest towns are Beverley(10km) and  
 Hull(12km) and many of the villagers  
 travel to these towns to work.Beverley
 is becoming popular with tourists and 
 Little Weighton has one of the few    
 camping/caravan sites in the area     
 which is an indication of its         
 picturesque qualities.                
 The population is not dominated by any
 particular age group.There are quite  
 good facilities for a village of its  
 size(pop.900),and there are good      
 facilities for shopping and recreation
 within short distances from the       
 village,although private transport is 
 becoming more of a necessity in order 
 to take advantage of them.
