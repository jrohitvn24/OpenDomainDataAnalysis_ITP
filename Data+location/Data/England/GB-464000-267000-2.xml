		<title>02EAST HADDON  SITE</title>
		<content>East Haddon is situated to the North   
West of Northampton. It is sited on a  
ridge in an area of undulating         
grassland. The soil is a mixture of    
sand clay and is of largely glacial    
origin. This too accounts for the      
undulating nature of the land.         
                                       
The village is sited to the North of   
the A428 Northampton to Rugby road.    
                                       
The village is of the "Ribbon type"    
giving the impression of a long drawn  
out development.Few houses are sited   
off one of the four roads.             
                                       
There is no river within the village.
