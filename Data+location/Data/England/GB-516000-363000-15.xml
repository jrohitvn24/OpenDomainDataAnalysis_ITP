 There are a lot of organised clubs in 
 Woodhall Spa for children.Some of them
 carry on to teenage clubs such as     
 guides.Of course they cost some money 
 but they're great fun.                
 There are other forms of occupations  
 that are not clubs such as paper      
 rounds that you get paid for          
 doing.There is a park in the village  
 with an outdoor swimming pool and a   
 paddling pool for the young children. 
 The park also contains many other     
 interesting things to do including    
 facilities for numerous sports.There  
 are many acres of woodland both in the
 village and nearby for the children to
 play in.
