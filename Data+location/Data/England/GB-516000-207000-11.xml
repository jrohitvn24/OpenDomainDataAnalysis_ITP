		<title>11GAMES WE PLAY:ST.ALBANS</title>
		<content> These are games people in our class   
 play in the playground.{TENNIS, COPS  
{AND ROBBERS, PICCADILLY, RUGBY,       
{CRICKET, FOOTBALL AND SKIPPING.}The 2 
 most popular games are tennis and     
 football. Most of the girls play      
 tennis and most of the boys play      
 football. Some games are very unusual 
 and some people don't know them.  My  
 favourite game is skipping and I am   
 the only person who likes skipping a  
 lot. My best friend likes playing cops
 and robbers. The most uncommon game is
 Piccadilly. One person hides while the
 others stand at a post and count to   
 100. Then they run between 2 posts and
 the other person runs out and tries to
 catch them between posts. If he       
 succeeds he shouts "Piccadilly".
