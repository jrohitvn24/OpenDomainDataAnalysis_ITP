		<content> The main road carries an almost       
 ceaseless flow of traffic to and from 
 Gloucester especially on market days  
 (Mondays and Thursdays) when you can  
 see livestock carriers from the       
 2-small-animal size up to             
 double-decker multi-animal ones.The   
 bus route between the Forest of Dean  
 and Gloucester runs along the main    
 road here while away across the common
 is a railway-line carrying trains     
 between Gloucester and Chepstow.      
 Cyclists need care because of the     
 narrowness of the road for the volume 
 and speed of the traffic it carries   
 and the "backwash" from the           
 lorries.When the Severn Bridge is     
 closed to high-sided vehicles because 
 of strong winds,that traffic comes    
 along our road if travelling between  
 South Wales and the South-West of     
 England or the London regions.        </content>
