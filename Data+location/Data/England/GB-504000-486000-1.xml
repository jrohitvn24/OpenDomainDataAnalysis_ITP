		<title>01Break Dancing</title>
		<content>{Break dancing}is a 1980's form of     
 dancing.{Break dance}is done on the   
 floor by using your back and nearly   
 every part of your body, but only on  
 the floor. {Body popping}is a kind of 
 movement but not on the floor using   
 your hands and feet making waves up   
 your body. The craze came from the    
 U.S.A. In Scarborough the good        
 breakers go to the {Hip Hop Square.}  
 It is in Town behind the Library and  
 all the best breakers and poppers go  
 there. They bring a very loud tape    
 recorder called a power blaster and   
 play special music. The square walls  
 have lots of specially sprayed        
 grafitti saying things like {Hip Hop  
{Beat }and{Breaking.}Most breakers wear
 jackets which are slippy and good for 
 breaking. They are called Mileta, Nike
 and Riki jackets. It makes a colourful
 scene.                                </content>
