		<title>01    A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>  In the morning I get up at 7.30 and  
 have{breakfast}of cereal,toast and    
 butter. I get dressed and at 8.30,my  
 mum or my Auntie Sue take me by car to
{school}.We go in the hall at 9.00 for 
 prayers. We do tables test and some   
 Maths and we go out to play at 10.30  
 to run about. We go back inside and as
 the day goes on it comes to 3.15 when 
 I return home. If the weather is      
 bright,I go to the beach at L'Eree to 
 have a swim in the sea. If it is less 
 sunny I go to look at the{German      
{bunkers}by the slipway on L'Eree      
 beach,they are damp and dirty now but 
 put up during the German occupation. I
 live just across the road from the    
 beach so I can go whenever I like. On 
 L'Eree beach I enjoy making holes in  
 the sand or playing on the{drainage   
{pipe}.Sometimes I go fishing with my  
 dad in his boat.   By {Hayley Piriou }</content>
