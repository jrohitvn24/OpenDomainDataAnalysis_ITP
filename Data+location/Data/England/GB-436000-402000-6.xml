		<content> COAL MINING IS THE MAIN INDUSTRY OF   
 THE AREA AND IN OUR SCHOOL OF 126     
 FAMILIES 56 HAVE ONE OR MORE WORKERS  
 IN THE MINES. ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO   
 THE MINERS RETURNED TO WORK AFTER THE 
 LONGEST STRIKE EVER WITHOUT ACHIEVING 
 ANYTHING AND SO WE ASKED OUR FATHERS  
 AND BROTHERS WHO ARE MINERS WHAT THEIR
 FEELINGS WERE. THEY SAID THAT SOON    
 THERE WILL BE NO MINES AROUND         
 BARNSLEY. THE NATIONAL COAL BOARD WAS 
 OUT TO CLOSE THEM DOWN.  THEY SAID    
 THAT ALL DOMESTIC HEAT WOULD THEN BE  
 PROVIDED BY GAS AND OIL. NONE OF THEM 
 THOUGHT THEY WERE BEING PAID ENOUGH   
 FOR WHAT THEY DID, AND ALTHOUGH IT IS 
 A RISKY JOB THEY TRIED TO FORGET THE  
 RISKS. IF THEY WERE HONEST THOUGH, THE
 RISKS WERE ALWAYS AT THE BACK OF THEIR
 MINDS.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
