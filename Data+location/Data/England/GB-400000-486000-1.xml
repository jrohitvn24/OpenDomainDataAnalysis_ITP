		<title>01INTRODUCTION MID-WENSLEYDALE</title>
		<content>     Our area is in the Yorkshire Dales
 National Park which covers 680 square 
 miles.  It is the third largest       
 National Park after the Lake District 
 and Snowdonia. Our area includes part 
 of Wensleydale and part of Bishopdale.
 It is an area of outstanding natural  
 beauty and many people come to spend  
 their holidays here enjoying the      
 scenery, walking and sharing the      
 amenities of the countryside. Many    
 local people are involved in tourism  
 but the most important industry is    
 farming. Most farms are hill farms,   
 producing sheep for the meat market   
 and for wool. There are some dairy    
 herds, mostly of Friesian cows, where 
 farms have suitable grazing. Much of  
 the land is upland and of poor quality
 There is no arable land.Most buildings
 are of stone. Dry stone walls are a   
 feature of the landscape.             </content>
