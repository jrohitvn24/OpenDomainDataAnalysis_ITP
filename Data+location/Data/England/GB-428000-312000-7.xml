		<content>  The housing in Donisthorpe is of     
 varied appearance.Along the main      
 street,one struggles to see two houses
 alike.Most of the dwellings date from 
 the early part of the century and     
 reflect the equitable building climate
 of that time. The result is a village 
 of well constructed buildings of      
 individual architecture.              
  There are two small council estates  
 of terraced, rendered houses. There is
 also a strip of modern bungalows. The 
 most curious feature concerns a rather
 imposing dwelling of three stories on 
 the Moira Rd, for it has had a        
 spacious bungalow built in its front  
 garden.                               
  Netherseal presents a different      
 character. Around a nucleous of       
 large sandstone Edwardian dwellings   
 an expanse of modern 3 and 4 bedroomed
 houses have been constructed.         </content>
