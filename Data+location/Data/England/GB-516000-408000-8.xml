		<title>08A MODERN KEELBY BEDROOM</title>
		<content> I LOVE TO PLAY IN MY BEDROOM BECAUSE  
 THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO.NORMALLY IF I  
 AM ALONE I PLAY ON MY PORTABLE        
 TELEVISION WHICH SERVES THREE         
 PURPOSES.THE TELEVISION IS USED WITH  
 MY ATARI GAMES MACHINE,COMPUTER AND   
 ON ITS OWN AS INTENDED.               
        .MY MOST FAVOURITE POSSESION   
 IS MY STEREO DECK AND CASSETTES. THE  
 MOST USELESS OBJECT THAT I OWN IS MY  
 CODE KIT.MY MOST EXPENSIVE POSSESION  
 IS MY COMMODORE 64 COMPUTER WHICH IS  
 VERY USEFUL AND ENJOYABLE.MY BEDROOM  
 IS NOT VERY TIDY BECAUSE THERE IS SO  
 MUCH STUFF AROUND.THERE ARE SO MANY   
 ELECTRICAL GADGETS THAT MY DAD HAD TO 
 BUY SPECIAL 4-WAY PLUGS TO FIT THE    
 SOCKETS.EVERYTHING IN MY BEDROOM IS   
 RED AND WHITE BECAUSE I AM A LIVERPOOL
 F.C. SUPPORTER.I HAVE LIVERPOOL       
 WALL-PAPER AND RED CURTAINS WHICH     
 DECORATE MY SPACIOUS ROOM .           </content>
