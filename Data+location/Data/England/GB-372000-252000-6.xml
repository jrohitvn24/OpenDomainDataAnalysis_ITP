		<title>06FOX FRUIT FARM continued</title>
		<content>  Early in 1984 Fox Fruit built a      
 freezer amd processing room.They had  
 enlarged their business to include    
 the processing of soft fruits.They do 
 not grow these themselves but buy from
 local farmers as well as from abroad. 
 Fruit comes from Yugoslavia,Poland and
 from as far away as New Zealand.When  
 the fruit arrives it is frozen, then  
 inspected for leaf and other          
 impurities, graded for size and colour
 and packed,in the processing room,    
 into 18 kilo boxes. It is then retuned
 to the freezer where it is stored     
 until sold. It is sold to food        
 manufacturers throughout the country. 
  Ten women are employed in the        
 processing room,working from 8:30 to  
 4:30pm.Because the room is chilled    
 they were provided with "Moon-boots"  
 last winter.It was very cold work then
 but very nice on hot summer days.     </content>
