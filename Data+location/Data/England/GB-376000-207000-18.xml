 The current owner of Fromebridge Mill 
 is interested in a project to make    
 electricity from the weir and to      
 further modernise the plant.          
                                       
 The mill used to have a row of six    
 cottages for the workers. Several of  
 these have been modernised and one of 
 the employees lives in one of them.   
 The office manager lives in Gloucester
 and travels to work.                  
                                       
 The mill is actually owned by a Greek 
 who lives in Athens. On a day to day  
 basis the mill is run by his wife.    
                                       
 The mill has a farm attached which    
 raises beef cattle.
