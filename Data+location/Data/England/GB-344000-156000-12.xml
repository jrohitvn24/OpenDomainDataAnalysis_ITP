		<title>12Transport problems.</title>
		<content> If you have your own car you can      
 travel where and when you like but if 
 you rely on public transport you      
 sometimes have problems. Buses travel 
 approximately 1,144 times through the 
 village of Shipham in a year.But this 
 means only one bus to Cheddar twice a 
 day from Monday to Saturday and one   
 bus to Bristol twice a day from Monday
 to Friday.So as part of our survey we 
 e done a vehicle census just          
 outside the school for 15 minutes on  
 two different days.The results        
                {C   L   B    T  V

{C:Cars,L:Lorries,B:Buses,T:Tractors,V:
{Vans. }From this it is possible to see
 that cars are the most common means of
 transport whether it is in the morning
 or afternoon.
