		<title>12Oil Seed Rape</title>
		<content> The first type Oil Seed Rape is the   
 one mainly grown in the British Isles.
 The minute seed is planted in well    
 prepared ground in August; by December
 it has grown approx. 38_46cms. It is  
 susceptible to extreme frost, but of  
 more concern are the pigeons, they can
 quickly destroy a crop even when they 
 do not particularly like it, but have 
 nothing else to eat, a deterrent "gas 
 banger" is used which is let off at   
 intervals, any time of between 4      
 minutes and 40 minutes.               
   Growth restarts in February/March   
 time and by May when the flowers      
 appear the plant stands 120-160cms    
 high, growth is roughly 15cms per     
 week. Although supposedly             
 self-pollinating sun is appreciated   
 during this four week flowering       
 period, for the bees to assist the    
 process, and from June onwards to     </content>
