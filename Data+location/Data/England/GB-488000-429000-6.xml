		<title>06MORE OF A SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content>      We were sitting down, it was fish
 fingers, chips and peas.              
      I was only allowed to go out at  
 dinner plays.  It was a sunny day, we 
 were playing "Block", Michael was it. 
 Me, Stephen, Stuart and Daniel, we all
 hid in the bushes.  We  went in we    
 did some silent reading, then we did  
 some topic, we have to write about The
 Domesday Book 1986.  Soon it was time 
 to go out, Mrs.Stothard said we could 
 play football. I bought some football 
 stickers off Richard Sutton for 30p.  
 It was nearly time to go home.  When  
 the taxi had taken us home, I got     
 changed and went to my Grandad's farm,
 I fed my little bullocks, I fed the   
 big ones as well.  I said "I'm going  
 to get my tea, I'll come back later." 
     I had beef mash and carrots.
