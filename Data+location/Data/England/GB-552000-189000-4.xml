		<content> A random sample of 100 families was   
 taken. 52 mothers work, 15 full time, 
 37 part-time. Of these 30 do          
 secretarial work, 13 work in shops, 2 
 run their own business, 1 is a nurse, 
 3 do domestic work, 1 works in a pub  
 and 2 work at home.                   
 In the 100 sample, 97 fathers work at 
 the following occupations. 3 run their
 own businesses, 7 are policemen,3 work
 in education, 10 hold managerial jobs,
 10 work in finance, 4 work in         
 telecommunications, 3 are in the      
 printing trade, 1 is a physicist, 1 is
 a solicitor, 16 work in offices, 1 is 
 a jeweller, 1 is a fish merchant, 2   
 are surveyors, 8 are drivers, 10 work 
 in building trades and 17 are in      
 industry. The discrepancy of 3 is not 
 due to unemployment but to single     
 parent families.
