		<content> The oldest areas of housing in{Belper 
{and Milford}are the cottages on both  
 sides of the{Derwent}which housed the 
{Strutt employees.                     
 These homes, now in an area of        
 conservation, were built between{1785 
 and{1790.}The Park's Council estate   
 built in{1956}offered homes to many   
 miners and foundary workers.          
 The largest residential areas of      
 Belper, built between {1962 and 1985, 
 extend eastwards from the Derwent.    
 Many of Derby's{British Rail and Rolls
{Royce}staff live in these homes       
 alongside those who work locally. The 
{population today is 18,000.           
 Farmers and professional people live  
 in{Hazelwood Village.}There homes are 
 built of stone and are luxurious and  
 expensive.
