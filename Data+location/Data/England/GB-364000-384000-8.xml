		<title>08CAMSLEY GRANGE FARM</title>
		<content> My name is Lesley Wright and I live   
 on Camsley Grange Farm which is on the
 outskirts of Lymm and Thelwall.       
 The farm occupies an area of 47 acres 
 and our stock consists of 4 cows and 5
 calves, 16 horses, 5 geese, 4 ducks   
 and one hen.  As pets I have 2        
 rabbits, 2 goldfish, 3 cats and 4 dogs
 one of which is a fevocious alsation  
 which acts as a guard dog.            
 On the farm the cows are used for     
 breeding and the calves are sometimes 
 sold at Chelford Market.  One of the  
 mares, an ex-race horse, is now too   
 old for breeding but one of her foals 
 was sold as a race horse.  Eight of   
 the horses are known as 'Liveries'.   
 Their owners pay for food and         
 stabling.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
