I opened my eyes to find a dog ready to
pounce on me!                          
I dressed and went downstairs followed 
by my dog Dream.After breakfast I      
helped Mum to feed the pups with       
sixteen weetabix and puppy milk.Next I 
went for a ride on my horse Flicka and 
afterwards cleaned my tack.            
For dinner I had cheese sandwiches and 
a cup of coffee.I watched television   
when suddenly I had an idea! I would   
build another jumping course.It took me
ages for the poles and stands kept     
falling on top of me! Once I had       
finished I caught Flicka again and     
spent the whole afternoon jumping him  
at tea time I gave him oats,pony nuts  
and mollichop and returned him to his  
field for the night.
