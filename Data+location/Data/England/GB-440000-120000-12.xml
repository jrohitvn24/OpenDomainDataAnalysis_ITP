		<title>12Hiltingbury - What We Found</title>
		<content> While walking around Hiltingbury the  
 children soon discovered the variety  
 and diversity of their environment.   
                                       
 The house styles which date from the  
 early 1900's to the present. Mostly   
 detached properties but also          
 including blocks of 4 storey flats.   
                                       
 The local shops were as they expected 
 but the small businesses were a       
 surprise. An Amusement Arcade         
 Supplier, and Illuminated Sign Maker  
 and a supplier of Freezer Packaging   
 materials all nestled into the        
 landscape.                            
                                       
 The land itself which ranges from     
 residential to open fields, conifer   
 plantations to small deciduous copses 
 all blended together into their own   
 locality.                             </content>
