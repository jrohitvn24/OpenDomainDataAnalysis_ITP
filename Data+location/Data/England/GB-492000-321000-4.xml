		<content>   The present green was laid in 1931, 
 and leased from a Mr. Doubleday until 
 1938 when it was sold to the club at a
 sum of Â£1.00 per member.The four rink 
 green has been extended this season by
 fifty per cent ,although the two new  
 rinks will not be playable until 1986.
 The club is affilliated to the        
 Grantham and District bowls           
 Association and compete against       
 fifteen other teams in a league.      
 Friendly matches are also played      
 against teams from a wide area        
 stretching from as far North as       
 Newark,to Rhyall and Cottesmore in the
 South. Inter club competitions are    
 held to determine singles,doubles and 
 triples champions annually.Younger    
 people are now taking up the sport,   
 disproving the saying that 'Bowls is  
 an old man's game! The oldest member  
 of the club is 78,the youngest is 14. </content>
