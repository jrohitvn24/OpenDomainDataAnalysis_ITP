		<content>    Duffield has{two}railway lines     
 running through it.The main line      
 from{London}through{Derby}to          
{Sheffield}and a branch freight line   
 to{Wirksworth.}It also has a local    
 station.                              
    Duffield is on the part of the line
 from{Derby to Matlock}which is testing
 a new multiple-unit train called{"The 
{Sprinter".                            
   {At Easter 1985}there was a special 
 passenger journey.It was from{Duffield
{to Wirksworth.}It was special because 
 only stone had been carried on that   
 line for at least twenty years. There 
 had been speculation that the branch  
 line would close altogether but this  
 one experimental passenger service    
 proved very popular and showed that   
 the line had tourist traffic          
 potential.
