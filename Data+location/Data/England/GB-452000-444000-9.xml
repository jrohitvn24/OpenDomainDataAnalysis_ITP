		<title>09House Prices in Bilbrough</title>
		<content> The price of housing in Bilbrough     
 reflects the inflation of the last 20 
 years.Many new houses have been built 
 since the war.The earlier ones 3/4    
 bedroomed detached houses in brick    
 originally cost between Â£5000 and     
 Â£8000.They sell now at Â£50 000 plus.  
 The larger ones costing Â£10 000 to    
 Â£12 000 have increased in price like  
 wise.                                 
 The Executive type houses currently   
 being built are in the Â£80 000 to     
 Â£90 000 range.None of these have much 
 land.An older house in the village    
 once part of the old orphanage has    
 just been sold for Â£130 000.It had    
 been modernised.The Manor House now on
 the market is priced at Â£300 000 for  
 the house and outbuildings alone.The  
 estate land can be bought separately.
