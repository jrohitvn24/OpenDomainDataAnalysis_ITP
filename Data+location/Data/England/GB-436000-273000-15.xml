		<title>15A PERSONAL VIEW OF RYTON</title>
		<content>{The Blacksmith's Arms}is the oldest   
 pub in the village,the{Landlord, Derek
{Warrington}said:   "As a newcomer.....
 I find the locals friendly and in the 
 main older.The customers provide their
 own entertainment,such as darts.  I   
 notice that the younger people tend to
 drink together in one part of the pub,
 away from the older.It seems a shame  
 that the old and young find it hard to
 mix.I'm sure the youngsters could     
 learn a lot by talking to some of the 
 wise old characters. I have also      
 noticed a marked presence of{"family" 
 in the village.{It seems that many are
{born, live and die in the village.}I  
 have learnt to be diplomatic, as it is
 important you say the right thing in a
{small closed environment}such as we   
 have.The{unemployed}do not come in and
 so miss out on an important source of 
 friendship and support."              </content>
