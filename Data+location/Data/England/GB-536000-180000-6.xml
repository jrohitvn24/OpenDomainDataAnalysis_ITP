		<content>The standard of our housing has a great
effect on our health.The effects of    
insecure and badly maintained housing, 
overcrowding and lack of amenities are 
apparent to all who experience them.   
But if you are homeless or live in a   
hostel,it is almost impossible to get  
the health care you need.GPs may refuse
to have you as a patient and hospitals 
may not treat patients who would norm- 
ally see a GP.Treatment may not be     
effective if you have to return to the 
same conditions that caused the illness
Sometimes people may even be afraid of 
you because of your appearance or they 
might be suspicious of you because you 
are unkempt and dirty.
