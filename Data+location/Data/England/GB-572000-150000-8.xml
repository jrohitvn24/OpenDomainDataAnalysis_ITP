		<content> Linton Hospital was originally built  
 as the local workhouse in 1776.  At   
 present the hospital consists of three
 parts: 8 wards for geriatric patients,
 a day hospital for elderly patients   
 who visit the hospital during the     
 daytime only and Twyford House which  
 is a unit for physically handicapped  
 patients.  The whole hospital has 222 
 beds and approximately 400 staff.     
                                       
                                       
 The hospital is forecasted to close   
 over the coming year or so with 2     
 wards transferring to the Maidstone   
 Hospital in November 1985, 2 wards to 
 Preston Hall in March 1986 and the    
 remainder in late 1986.  The ambulance
 control for the whole of Kent is due  
 to be centralised at Linton Hospital  
 in the future.
