{  }A Besom is a broom made out of     
 wood.He gets a{hazel}stick and cuts it
 to size.Then he makes a point on the  
 end with an axe.After that he strips  
 the bark off with a{spoke shave}and   
 smooths it with a{smooth shave.}That  
 is the handle made.                   
    To make the brush part he gets a   
 handful of{birch twigs}and bends them 
 in half.That is the middle of the     
 broom,called the dolly. Then he wraps 
 some more twigs around it.After that  
 he ties wire around it and trims the  
 edge with an axe.Then he puts a nail  
 in to hold it together.               
    Mr.Nash is famous for besom brooms 
 because{Wembley Stadium,London Zoo}and
{Buckingham Palace}purchase them.      </content>
