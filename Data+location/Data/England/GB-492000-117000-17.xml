		<title>17A WALK ON THE DOWNS</title>
		<content> I went with a Warden on the Downs     
 looking at orchids, the egg,          
 twayblade, common spotted &amp; fly       
 orchids. There was a flower called the
 bugle with petals shaped like a bugle.
 There is salad burnet which is edible 
 &amp; tasted like cucumber. There are many
 footpaths &amp; from some of them you can 
 look right down the valley. The woods 
 are covered with bluebells &amp; there are
 so many that the wood looks as if it  
 has a carpet. The Downs are covered   
 with trees &amp; some have fallen over, &amp; 
 have got ivy all over them. We are    
 very lucky because there are so many  
 wild flowers to see &amp; we use lots of  
 books so we can identify them.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
