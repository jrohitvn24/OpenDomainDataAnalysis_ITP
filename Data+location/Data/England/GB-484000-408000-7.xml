		<content> Westcliff is about 24 years old.      
 I live in Ripon Close just in front of
 Scotter Road. All of the houses are   
 joined together.                      
 West of Scotter Road there are woods  
 and Brumby Common Nature Reserve.     
 Westcliffe is scattered about with    
 litter which spoils it. Vandals pull  
 out planks of wood from fences and    
 write on walls.                       
 There is a good side to Westcliffe the
 people are friendly and helpful.      
 There are a lot of trees and grassy   
 places which children can play on and 
 the shops aren't far away.            
 Scotter Road is in use 24 hours a day.
 From the sirens, it seems as if there 
 is always an ambulance, fire engine or
 police car going down the road.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
