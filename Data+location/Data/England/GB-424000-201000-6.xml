		<title>06The Doctor in Langford</title>
		<content>  The local doctor has his own practice
and the only person that works with him
is his wife.He took over the practice  
eighteen months ago.He has a surgery   
in Langford and also in some of the    
surrounding villages.                  
  The doctor sees about two hundred    
patients every week and about ten      
percent are children. He sees more     
people in the winter than at any other 
time during the year. He gets called   
out at night about three or four times 
a week. He sends approximately four    
patients a week to hospital.(The John  
Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford).He visits
patients at home everyday of the week. 
He usually works fourteen hours a day  
and is on call all the time. He rarely 
catches anything from his patients. He 
perscribes over two thousand different 
kinds of medicine every year.
