 The area lends itself to              
 agriculture.Crops vary according to   
 factors such as soil-type,pH and      
 aspect.The soil closest the river is  
 very sandy if not graveley.The pH     
 falls markedly over 500 feet.The      
 climate is rather severe with an      
 approximate temperature range of -20C 
 to +28C air temperature over the past 
 four years.The ground usually remains 
 frozen at 1000 feet from mid-December 
 to early March,with snow lying on at  
 least 30 days.One can expect several  
 blizzards in a normal winter during   
 when roads become completely blocked.
