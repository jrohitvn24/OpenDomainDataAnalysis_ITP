		<content>  Life today is much better than in    
 1920.BMX bikes and computer games have
 taken the place of bowler hoops and   
 whips &amp; tops.School is also quite     
 different though we still have to     
 cross the yard to the toilet_the      
 teachers do as well!!_and we have to  
 trek round to the village hall for    
 lunch.We do a lot of finding out for  
 ourselves in lessons and we have a    
 computer to help us as well as our    
 teachers.At home most of us have a    
 car,a T.V.,hi_fi and even video.In    
 September we all move to a brand new  
 school in Leyburn.
