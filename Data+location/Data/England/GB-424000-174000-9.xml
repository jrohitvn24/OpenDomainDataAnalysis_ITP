		<title>09FOOD &amp; COOKERY</title>
		<content> People pride themselves on their      
 cooking skills using both British and 
 foreign recipes. Traditional dishes   
 prepared from home produced foods are 
 popular. Many grow fruit and          
 vegetables in their gardens to        
 supplement a wide variety of          
 commercial crops and imports. Many    
 worry about diet, food additives etc  
 in pursuit of weight reduction or     
 better health. Most meals are eaten at
 home, but occasional restaurant and   
 take-away meals fill gaps or mark     
 special events. Public houses provide 
 a range of snacks and meals. Fish and 
 chips, ice cream and snacks are       
 available from several shops.         
 Most children eat a midday meal at    
 school and join the family for an     
 early evening meal. Local shops stock 
 a wide variety of foods. Milk is      
 delivered to each house 4 times a week</content>
