		<title>14OUR VISIT TO THE FARM</title>
		<content> It was a good job we has our          
 wellingtons on, because the path to   
 the farmyard was muddy where the      
 tractor had left its clay trail.  Oh  
 what a smell - as we got closer you   
 could tell there were cows around, or 
 else they had been around.  It was    
 overpowering at first but, like the   
 farmer we got used to it.             
 The farmer showed us round.  The      
 milking parlour was spotless and full 
 of glass octopuses.  The tubes from   
 jars dangling down waiting to catch a 
 cow.                                  
 In the yard there were sheds with some
 small calves in and others with two   
 huge bulbs.  The farmer shouted at    
 some lads to get away from the bulbs, 
 but they had already decided to do    
 that.  The farmhouse was like a       
 mansion with a moat around it.  In the
 moat ducks swam quietly.              </content>
