		<title>06A Day in Bilson Infant Sch'</title>
		<content> On Monday at 9 o'clock when Mrs Oaten 
 does the register we do our news.After
 this we do our pink book. In these we 
 write about our families. In our white
 book we do things like writing down   
 who sits next to each other. After we 
 have done our white book we line up   
 for prayers and then we sing a        
 hymn. Miss Drewett asks if anybody has
 got a birthday. We give them 6 little 
 claps if they are 6 years old. We go  
 out to play at quarter to 11. After   
 play we do our Fletcher book, we do   
 things like sharing, adding and taking
 away. At 12 o'clock we have our       
 dinner. After dinner we make our model
 wigwams and canoe for our Indian      
 project. At half past 2 we go out to  
 play. After play we tidy up and then  
 Mrs Oaten reads us a story.
