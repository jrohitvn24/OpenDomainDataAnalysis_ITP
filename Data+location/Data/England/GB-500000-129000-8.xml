		<title>08 THE COKELERS</title>
		<content> In 1850{John William Sirgood}walked   
 from Clapham to Loxwood with his wife 
 and his hand cart to preach the       
 Gospel.His fame spread as he preached.
 He was reputed to have remarkable     
 powers as a faith healer and even to  
 have raised someone from the dead.    
 After opposition from the local       
 churches{he decided to form his own   
{sect, named the Cokelers or the       
{Dependants}They set up the{Combination
{Stores}in Loxwood  and ran them on    
 co-operative lines. The Stores have   
 now been demolished. The Cokelers kept
 very strict rules and marriage was not
 encouraged.  It is said that the name 
 "Cokelers" came from their custom of  
 serving cocoa after meetings. Few of  
 the sect are still living. Those who  
 are left live in "The Retreat" in Spy 
 Lane, a building which has its own    
 Chapel and burial ground.             </content>
