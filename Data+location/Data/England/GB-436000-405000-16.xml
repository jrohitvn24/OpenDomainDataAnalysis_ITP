		<title>16MORE CARS THAN LORRIES</title>
		<content> We did not see many lorries as we saw 
 cars because some long vehicle (lorry)
 are not allowed on certain road is not
 wide enough.  We don't see many       
 coaches as public buses because it's  
 too busy.  We see public service buses
 a lot because that is the way a lot of
 service buses go to get in to         
 Barnsley.   We didn't see many pick up
 trucks because they only collect      
 dustbin in the morning. We only saw 5 
 private coaches because day trips only
 go away at weekend mostly.  We saw    
 more vans than lorries because work   
 men use vans more than lorries because
 they are small and easier to use.     
 Most firms use vans with the firms    
 name on the side to advertise.  We    
 didn't see any push bikes at all.  I  
 think Pontefract Road is a very busy  
 road.
