		<title>05MAIN FARMING TYPES</title>
		<content>    The East is used as permanent      
 grassland for{dairy and beef cattle.  
 There are also some Smallholdings of  
 land used by{market gardeners. }The   
 produce is sold in farm shops and on  
 Ashton Market.                        
   {Deer}are kept by one farmer in     
 Daisynook but in the Woodhouses area  
{pigs}are the main concern.  This is   
 one of the most intensive pig         
 fattening areas in the North.  There  
 are over{20,000}pigs in the area.     
 Main reasons for this are the huge    
 amounts of waste food available       
 (increased by the "sell by dates" on  
 most food products) and the huge local
 market for pork and bacon products.   
 Most farmers in the area are contract 
 farmers who sell to {WALLS}who have a 
 factory nearby. Recent problems with  
 smells have been reduced by using new 
 equipment to boil food.               </content>
