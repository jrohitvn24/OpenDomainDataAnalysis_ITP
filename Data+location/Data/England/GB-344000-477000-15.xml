 Arnside is well served by both rail   
 and bus services.  There is a regular 
 rail service on the main line from    
{Barrow}which connects with the        
{Glasgow - London}line and{Lancaster - 
{Leeds}line at{Carnforth.              
 The bus service is mainly between     
 Arnside and{Kendal}via{Milnthorpe     
 although there are some bus services  
 which travel to{Lancaster}via         
{Silverdale}and{Carnforth.             
 Neither the rail nor bus services are 
 very well used by the local population
 unless they are travelling long       
 distances as most people in Arnside   
 have cars.  The road network is very  
 complex between Arnside and the south 
 but there is a good road to Milnthorpe
 and easy access to the M6 at Farleton.
