		<content> We struggled up an everlasting        
 greeting road to a humbled corner     
 shadowed over by terrific hung down   
 grappling.   Trumps of silent cattle  
 passing by through a grazing field of 
 lambs.  A sharp headed barb wire with 
 a rotting gate and a slip of trees    
 with leading down path with a bog at  
 the sides at a silent farm.   Down a  
 country lane and steep hill going down
 nearly breaking each bone in our body 
 and we came to a park.   First we sat 
 down playing sardines and listening to
 Colonel Stokes about the nature around
 us.   We were on our way, led by a    
 silent stream feeling hot and damp as 
 well.
