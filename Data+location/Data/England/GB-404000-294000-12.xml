		<title>12  BODY-POPPING</title>
		<content> At weekends and in the evenings many  
 young people spend their time moving  
 to music in a way called{body-popping.
 We put flat cardboard boxes on the    
 pavement and play a special kind of   
 music on tape recorders which we call 
 "Rasta-Blasters". Here is how you do  
 some of the moves.{LOCKING}you make   
 quick moves and have a short pause in 
 between.{BACKWALK}where you walk      
 backwards sliding your toes and       
 raising your heels alternately.{      
{BROOMWALK}this is like the Backwalk   
 but you move round in a circle.       
{HEARTBEAT}you move your hands palms   
 inwards, to cross your heart, then    
 push your chest out.{EGYPTIAN}to do   
 this you move like an eastern dancer  
 only jerkily. Most body-popping moves 
 you do standing up, but you can kneel 
 down in some moves too.               
                                       </content>
