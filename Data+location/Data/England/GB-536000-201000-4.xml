		<title>04Industry In Cheshunt</title>
		<content> The main industrial centre in this    
area is down Delamare Road.The main    
type of industry is light industry such
as engineering and printing.           
 A hundred years ago the main industry 
in Cheshunt was glasshouses,Cheshunt   
had good soil,plenty of water and was  
in easy reach of Covent Garden.By 1953 
there were 1,200 acres of land under   
glass.The most important glasshouses   
were those run by Rochfords.They       
concentrated on growing plants.Today   
only 600 acres are under glass.        
 A new industry to develop in Cheshunt 
is Tesco.Tesco have built a superstore 
at Brookfield Farm.They also have      
offices and warehouses down Delamare   
Road.They have brought alot of jobs to 
this area.From a survey of 30 people   
most worked in offices.Only 1 was      
unemployed.This is unusual since there 
are 3 million unemployed in the country</content>
