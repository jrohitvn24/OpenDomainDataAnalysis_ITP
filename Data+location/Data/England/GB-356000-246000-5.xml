		<content> Homelife revolves around the family.  
 The working day is normally eight     
 hours for five days a week.  Men and  
 women work on the farms or commute to 
 local towns.  Weekends and evenings   
 are leisure time with people visiting 
 public houses, watching television,   
 listening to the radio or visiting the
 village hall where a number of        
 activities go on to suit all ages.    
 Most people have large gardens and    
 gardening is a popular pastime.       
                                       
 Most people go away once a year on    
 holiday, sometimes to resorts abroad. 
 Cars are used for transport and some  
 people ride motor-cycles or bicycles. 
 Many people own a pet - a dog, cat,   
 bird or even a ferret.  Only dogs     
 require a licence, though a farmer's  
 working dog does not require one.
