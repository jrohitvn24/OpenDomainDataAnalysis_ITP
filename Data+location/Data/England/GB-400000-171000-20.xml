		<content> The Henage family owned the village   
 for more than 200 years, until it was 
 bought by the Co-op which sold it to  
 the villagers in 1930.They had to buy 
 their own houses or move away from the
 village.The population is now about   
 300.The church is the oldest building,
 being 800 years old.It has a screen   
 and a half hour glass to time the     
 sermon.One of the oldest cottages was 
 built in 1642.The school was closed in
 1963. There is a small shop which is  
 also the Post Office and sells        
 everything you need.A bus service     
 connects Compton Bassett with Calne,  
 Swindon and Devizes.Farmland surrounds
 the village and many people work on   
 the farms. Some used to go into Calne 
 to work in Harrises before it         
 closed.The school had a wood behind it
 and the children used to play a game  
 called "Fox and Hound" like tag.      </content>
