		<content>   {Mrs. Mills}was born in 1925 and has
 lived in{Kingsley Road}for 34 years.  
 She has been our school lollipop lady 
 for 31 years. She took the job because
 a little girl was knocked down and    
 Mrs. Mills met a policeman who needed 
 someone to guide the children safely  
 across the road. She told us that she 
 gets up every day at 5.00a.m. and goes
 to see her elderly neighbour. She     
 arrives at school at 8.00a.m. and     
 returns home at 9.00a.m. after making 
 sure that the children are safely     
 inside the school gate. She returns in
 the afternoon to make sure that the   
 children are also on the school taxi  
 safely. Our school is on a very busy  
 corner.                               
    In l982{she was awarded the B.E.M. 
 for long service. She now sees        
 children into school whose parents    
 came under her care years ago.        </content>
