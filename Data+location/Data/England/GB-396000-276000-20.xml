		<title>20Annual Holidays</title>
		<content>     On a school survey into just where
 people go for their holidays it was   
 found that 41% of families still can  
 afford to go abroad for their         
 holidays.                             
     The most popular spot for         
 continental holidays, both with the   
 children and their parents is still   
 the popular resorts of Spain.         
     Those that do not go abroad still 
 look for an annual holiday by the     
 sea-side. This means that most        
 families prefer to holiday in either  
 Cornwall or Devon because they can    
 expect to get more sunshine than if   
 they holiday elsewhere.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
