 In Rawcliffe Bridge there is a factory
 called Lin Pac.  It started in 1890.  
 To start a factory there had to be    
 water and people.                     
 The first factory was built at Louth, 
 it was there because there was        
 suitable land.  Later on a factory was
 built at Featherstone.  In 1976 that  
 factory burnt down.  So Lin Pac built 
 one at Rawcliffe Bridge.  At Rawcliffe
 Bridge Lin Pac make things out of     
 corrugated Cardboard.  They make boxes
 out of the cardboard.  At Lin Pac 200 
 people are working.
