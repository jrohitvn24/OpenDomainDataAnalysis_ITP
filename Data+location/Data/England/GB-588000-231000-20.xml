		<content>    A lot of people are concerned about
 the loss of bus links around north    
 Essex.                                
    These have been replaced by        
 Eastern National's "country car".These
 so called "country cars"(Peugeot      
 504S)cost Â£10,000.The cheapest single 
 decker bus costs Â£40,000 and the      
 double decker bus costs Â£70,000.      
    The country car service is mainly  
 for old age pensioners and one car    
 families when the father takes his    
 car to work.                          
    The villages which are going to be 
 served with the "country car"service  
 are:Great Tey, Little Bromley,        
 Easthorpe, Fingringhoe, Little Bentley
 and Tendring.The "country car"service 
 runs in and out of Colchester three   
 times a day from 9:00 a.m.to 3:30 p.m.
    Mt. Bures will also be served by a 
 "country car" service in the future.  </content>
