		<title>06THE FLOWER FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> This festival is a collection of      
 flower arrangements based on a theme  
 inside the church,for people to come  
 and look at and enjoy.The idea for the
 flower festival was started by a lady 
 called Mrs Banting,and she now        
 organises the event.They first decided
 to hold it in 1982.Every 3 years since
 1982 we have had a flower festval in  
 our local church which is St Matthews.
 This year the flower festival was held
 on June 21,22 and 23.It is not always 
 on the same day or month.Last time it 
 was held in July.The theme this year  
 was Hymns of Praise.Some of the hymns 
 illustrated were Bread of Heaven, All 
 Things Bright and Beautiful and       
 Jerusalem.The money which was raised  
 paid for plaster-work in the church   
 which is urgently needed.Flowers were 
 grown and people came from many places
 for this special occasion.            </content>
