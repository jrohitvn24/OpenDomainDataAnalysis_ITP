		<content> A large part of the area is           
 residential,the oldest house we saw   
 was built in 1740-a detached house on 
 Gilbert Bank. The houses on Redhouse  
 Lane are terraced houses  built in    
 1865(Church Terrace) 1887(Church      
 Villas) 1902(Brookfield) and 1915. On 
 Brookfield Avenue there are 3 police  
 houses, a pair of semi-detached and a 
 detached house. Most were built after 
 the second World War.A wallpaper      
 factory has been pulled down and in   
 its place a new estate is being built 
 called Churchfields. 120 houses will  
 be built. The prices of these houses  
 range from Â£23,800 to Â£35,000. The    
 houses at Lowick Green are 4 years    
 old mainly bungalows, detached or     
 semi detached houses.  At the bottom  
 of Mill Lane there are some mobile    
 homes,4 years old, owned by E Ogden a 
 local farmer.                         </content>
