		<content> There are about 16{bungalows}and they 
 were built in 1964 and 1965. They were
 built on Stanton Court's ground by a  
 man called{Bill Kew.}Stanton did not  
 have any main drainage until 1971 when
 they laid it for the service station. 
 Before that it smelt. The bungalows   
 were built on an orchard and Mr and   
 Mrs King owned it. Mr Bill Kew came   
 from Dunley near Bristol. He sold 12  
 and a quarter acres which were        
 building plots one by one, he built   
 them by order as plots were sold. He  
 was a small builder, he sub-contracted
 plumbing, plastering and heating. The 
 first bungalow he built was the one on
 the corner, he built it for a show    
 house and he lived in it. Mr Kew later
 moved to Kington Langley. When he had 
 completed the 12 bungalows most were  
 purchased by{RAF}officers.
