		<title>17The Shireoak.</title>
		<content> It is generally accepted that the     
 village of{Shireoaks}is named after a 
 tree, or trees, near the village,     
 which stood at the meeting place of   
 three shires,{Derby,Notts}and{Yorks.  
 The original tree, which was very     
 large, having a spread of ninety four 
 feet,survived until 1800 and may      
 have been replaced by one until 1864. 
 Another was not planted until 1951 but
 it unfortunately died and another was 
 planted in{Jubilee Year,}1977, by the 
{Mothers Union.}This tree stands around
 5m tall at present. Due to boundary   
 changes the present tree does not     
 stand on the original site, which was 
 further to the east than it is today. 
 It is not thought that the{Shireoak   
 was ever used for any traditional     
 events, such as the{Mayday Morris     
{Dancing}at the{Todwick Trysting Tree, 
 but has been an unusual boundary mark.</content>
