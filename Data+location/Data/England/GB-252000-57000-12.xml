		<title>12   IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE</title>
		<content>   In our area ninety three per cent of
 people like where they live.Thirty    
 per cent of people think that there   
 should be more facilities for         
 children.Fifteen per cent would like  
 more sports facilities.Ten per cent   
 wanted a community centre,some more   
 shops and better roads.Thirteen per   
 cent of people would not like any more
 building and ten per cent even said   
 they could not think of a way to      
 improve the area where they live.     
 Only seven per cent do not like the   
 area they live in.                    
   It is estimated that there are about
 one thousand children living in this  
 survey area.The only facilities       
 available to them are two small parks,
 and clubs and societies held in       
 school buildings.                     
   All children surveyed said that the 
 facilities should be improved.        </content>
