		<content>    The Mendips are a lovely place to  
 go horse riding. Although there are no
 riding schools in this particular     
 area, the country lanes make a        
 pleasant hack.                        
    Gymkhanas are held at many local   
 venues including Binegar, Emborough,  
 Charterhouse and West Pennard.        
    If you wish to join a pony club the
 main one is Mendip Farmers based at   
 Priddy. The local hunt is also the    
 Mendip Farmers similarly based at     
 Priddy. Point to Point races take     
 place frequently in the spring at the 
 racecourse just to the east of Nedge  
 Hill south of Chewton Mendip.         
    Although there used to be a        
 blacksmith in Chewton Mendip until a  
 few years ago, horse owners must now  
 employ a travelling farrier.
