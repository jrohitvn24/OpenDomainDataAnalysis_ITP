		<title>13Traffic Problems, Turvey</title>
		<content> In 1984 the A428 had an average daily 
 traffic flow of 6450, 18% are heavy   
 goods vehicles. The road is fairly    
 straight within the village, speeds   
 are high despite the limit, yetthere  
 are many concealed entrances and      
 footpaths are narrow. Those who live  
 on the main road have to tolerate the 
 noise and suction of passing traffic, 
 fear of vehicles mounting the pavement
 and the hazard for car owners of      
 entering or leaving their homes. Spray
 from the salt and rain blackens the   
 walls and windows and erodes stone    
 walls and paintwork. The Parish       
 Council have a Road Safety Committee. 
 A By-pass is being considered for     
 after 1991, whilst aware of the       
 benefit of this, they have recently   
 been considering the disadvantagesto  
 some, such as loss of trade to        
 businesses.                           </content>
