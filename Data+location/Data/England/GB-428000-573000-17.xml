		<title>17Our School</title>
		<content> Our{school opened}on 26th May 1873.   
 The{first head}was Mr. Henry Keir and 
 there were 164 children. Today our    
 head is Mr. Fenwick and we have 190   
 children aged from 4 to 9 years. The  
{building}used to be two separate      
 schools but now it is one. We have 6  
 classrooms, and 1 hall. Our kitchen is
 too small to cook food, so we have our
 meals delivered in a van from Astley  
 High School. Our{schoolday}is in 3    
 parts: 9.00 am to 10.30 am, 10.45 am  
 to 12 noon and 1.15 pm to 3.15 pm. We 
 have a morning break and a lunch      
 break. We have to finish at exactly   
 3.15 because many children have to get
 a special bus home. This means that   
 the lunch break is very busy because  
 all our{clubs}happen then. The most   
 popular are Recorders and Science     
 Club. We have a choir which does a    
 show in the Summer term.              </content>
