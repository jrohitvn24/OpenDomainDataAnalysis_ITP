We sent out 350 questionnaires and 62% 
of the ones that were returned said    
their parents had {employment} in      
London.I think so many people work     
there because we live in a commuterbelt
area.There are also alot of jobs in    
London.There are many other places     
where people work,and a large number   
of these are within a 20 mile radius   
of Chalfont St. Peter. There is not    
much {unemployment} here,and it is a   
very wealthy area.                     
   Our questionnaire also included a   
section about {housing}.There were     
three subsections 60% of those         
returned said they lived in detached   
houses, 22% said they lived in         
semidetached houses.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
