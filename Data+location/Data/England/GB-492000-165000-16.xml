		<title>16LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> Sunninghill is an Anglo-Saxon name and
 with it comes a mountain of history   
 waiting to be told.Through the ages   
 Sunninghill/Sunningdale have been     
 places to come and enjoy the clean and
 salutory waters.In Regency times the  
 area was an important Spa and the     
 atmosphere was one of music,dancing   
 and refined splendour.This was not so 
 in the 17th Century when people came  
 to the area to escape the effects of  
 the deadly plague.With Windsor Great  
 Park on its doorstep the area         
 maintains its links with Royalty. Road
 names give a clue to some the pastimes
 pursued by the gentry e.g.Kennel ride,
 Huntsmans Meadow etc.Apart from name  
 evidence the local history may be     
 revealed by other "clues"e.g. Norman  
 arch in Sunninghill Church and        
 Broomhall Farm-formerly Broomhall     
 Nunnery dissolved by Henry V111.      </content>
