		<title>16WORK IN A RURAL AREA.</title>
		<content>   Not many years ago the main type of 
 employment in this area was farmwork. 
 However, with the increasing use of   
{machinery, computer technology}and    
{higher wages,}there are fewer workers 
 required on the farm.                 
   Many of the farmers whom we visited 
 now employ fewer workers than they did
 about ten years ago, some only half   
 the number.One farmer said that he has
 kept the same work-force, but has now 
 doubled the size of his{dairy herd.   
   Today's agricultural worker is more 
 likely to specialize in some aspect of
 farm work or management, rather than  
 be a general labourer. Farming today  
 is very highly skilled work.          
   The{population}of this rural area is
 changing as country people move to the
 towns looking for other jobs,while the
 town people move out,prefering to live
 in the quieter rural areas.           </content>
