		<content> well looked after.  There are a few   
 shops including newsagents,           
 hairdressers and an ICI petrol        
 station.  The most interesting one was
 a dog-grooming parlour.               
                                       
  {    Station Road}is a little bit    
 better.  The houses are still terraced
 and have small front gardens.  At the 
 end of the road is{North Road Station 
{and museum. }The station is an "open  
 station" and was deserted.  The walls 
 are covered with graffiti and the     
 rails and platform are strewn with    
 rubbish.  The museum was also         
 deserted.  People have to pay to get  
 in.  The rooms are full of grandfather
 clocks and things used in old         
 stations.
