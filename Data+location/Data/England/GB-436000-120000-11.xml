		<title>11Hilliers Nursery (contd)</title>
		<content> Mr. Wicken's favourite job is in the  
 office. The other things that Hilliers
 sell are barbeques, deck chairs and   
 garden furniture and accessories. The 
 nursery was once much bigger but now  
 covers two acres. Hilliers future plan
 is to knock down the old green house  
 and extend the car park. They have    
 greatly improved the layout of the    
 plants and shrubs. There seems to be  
 one for every letter of the alphabet! 
 Mr. Wickens does not believe in       
 talking to the plants to make them    
 grow!
