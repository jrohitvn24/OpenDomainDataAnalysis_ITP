		<title>02CULMSTOCK BEACON</title>
		<content> The south-west point of BLACKDOWN     
 COMMON is called CULMSTOCK BEACON, on 
 which stands a unique BEEHIVE BEACON  
 HUT said to date from Armada times, if
 not earlier.  This Beacon Hut was used
 for lighting fires as a warning of    
 advancing enemies, for example, 'The  
 Spanish Armada' and was one in a chain
 of fire signals.  Nowadays, fires are 
 lit in the Hut in celebration, such as
 the ending of the War and the Queen's 
 Silver Jubilee in 1977.               
 About 50 acres of land on Culmstock   
 Beacon have been given to the people  
 of Culmstock, in perpetuity, for      
 their enjoyment and recreation. Lying 
 in an area designated as one of       
 outstanding natural beauty, there is  
 an abundance of flora to enjoy - the  
 Beacon clad in bell-heather and ling  
 is a sight to remember! Signs of flint
 stone quarrying can still be seen.    </content>
