		<title>06OLD BUILDINGS IN EDGEFIELD</title>
		<content> The importance of farming historically
 is shown in the splendid 16th &amp; 17th  
 century farm buildings which still    
 remain. Edgefield Hall has had many   
 additions and alterations but the core
 is Tudor and the Tudor porch still    
 stands. Old Hall Farm,reputed to have 
 a priest's hole, is a substantial E-  
 shaped building of the early 17th     
 century, recently taken over as the   
 base of a small wood-working industry.
 The Mount, The Pyghtles, and the      
 building now used by Edgefield Pottery
 give an impression of great prosperity
 in the 16th &amp; 17th centuries, but     
 Canon Marcon's memoirs tell of great  
 poverty in tiny labourers' cottages:  
 he tells of doorways less than 5 feet 
 high and vertical ladders leading     
 to upper floors. Some of today's      
 cottages were originally several      
 dwellings now put together.           </content>
