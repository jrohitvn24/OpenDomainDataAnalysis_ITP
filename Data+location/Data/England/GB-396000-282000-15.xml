		<title>15Windsor High, Halesowen</title>
		<content>    My present school is Windsor High. 
 It is situated in Richmond Street.    
 There are about 900 pupils and 68     
 teachers.                             
    Halesowen Schools have changed     
 during the last two years. Originally 
 this school was called the Richmond   
 High School for Boys. It has combined 
 with the Walton High School for Girls 
 and now has pupils aged from 11 to 16.
    At the moment the school is having 
 a lot of new buildings. A new gym,    
 creative studies block, lecture       
 theatre and an all-weather pitch.     
    The school puts on a lot of        
 activities like hill climbing, pony   
 trekking and indoor tennis, and trips 
 such as one to France that has just   
 taken place. Some of these have been  
 recently affected by teachers strikes.
