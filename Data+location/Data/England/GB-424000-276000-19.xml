		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE OF TRACY</title>
		<content> I got up early on Sunday morning. Mum 
 and Dad were still in bed. Mum got up 
 and made our breakfast. Dad stayed in 
 bed. I brushed my teeth and put on my 
 Brownie uniform, which is a brown     
 dress with a yellow tie. Brownies are 
 all girls. Mum and I went to church on
 the bus. A bus is a large vehicle     
 taking passengers to places for       
 payment. We didn't have Sunday School 
 that morning. Sunday School is where  
 you learn about Jesus. The choir were 
 there. The choir is a group of people 
 who sing together. After church we    
 went to my Grandma's before going     
 home. After dinner we watched         
 television. This is where pictures    
 move on a screen. At night I had a    
 bath. A bath is where you wash your   
 hair and your body. I stayed up until 
 8 o'clock then I brushed my teeth and 
 went to bed.                          </content>
