		<title>15The Putnoe Area</title>
		<content> Some of the main features in this area
 are Mowsbury Park and the golf        
 course.Mowsbury Park covers about 5   
 acres and has been kept well.It has   
 tennis courts,bowling greens,football 
 and cricket pitches.The majority of   
 the park is grassland with Putnoe     
 Woods next to it.This has not been    
 kept very well but it does have a     
 large variety of plant and animal     
 life.On the north edge of the woods is
 a stream that separates it from the   
 golf course.The main school which     
 serves this area is Mark Rutherford   
 Upper School.This currently  has about
 850 pupils and 52 teaching staff.Since
 there are fewer children living in the
 area the main concern at the moment is
 the proposed merger of Mark Rutherford
 and Pilgrim Upper schools.
