		<content> This district of valley and hills must
 surely be some of the most beutiful   
 countryside in Shropshire. It is a    
 rural farming area, sheep cattle, both
 for milk and beef, a turkey farm and  
 beekeepers. The valley has rich,      
 fertile soil with the river Corve     
 running alongside.  It provides       
 grazing ground, and arable land where 
 crops of cereal and oil seed  rape    
 are sown in autumn Two narrow steep   
 roads led from valley to bent, each   
 has a chapel one derelict, one        
 transcendental meditation, many old   
 cottages, farm houes, and an old      
 school now the village hall. Woodlands
 abound conifer and hardwood not well  
 cared for. Some small shafts from an  
 attempted copper mining in 19th       
 century. An abundance of wild life    
 animals, birds, flowers.
