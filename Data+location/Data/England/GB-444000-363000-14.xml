		<title>14PEOPLE'S FEARS AT HARDWICK</title>
		<content>  Here in an area where it could almost
 be thought time has stood still, the  
 everyday worries of the inhabitants   
 are very much rooted in the present   
 day. The fear of{redundancy}looms     
 heavily over those employed in        
 businesses and the problem of         
 unemployment generally is a great     
 concern to all.                       
  The possibility of a{nuclear war     
 provides for some a nagging irritation
 and is accompanied by an{abhorrence of
{violence}in all its forms.            
  However, because many of the         
 inhabitants are farmers it is the     
{weather}which causes them the greatest
 anxiety. This is a particular worry   
 after such a poor summer as this one  
 in 1985.                              
  Changing attitudes also worried some,
 especially the dictatorship of{greed  
 and the{lack of respect}for authority.</content>
