		<content>{Lanscape. }The soil is clay, subsoil  
 clay and marl with outcrops of        
 TIlestone and Cornstone. The landscape
 is thus undulating with many small    
 streams forming small valleys some    
 with steep inclines.Small copses,     
 isolated old oaks and orchards stil   
 syrvive to provide varied  scenes.    
{Buildings.}Several Farmhouses,        
 cottages and barns are Listed         
 Buildings ( mainly late 17th. or early
 18th. century.)They have walls of     
 local Sandstone, some with Timber     
 Frames and rooves of stone tiles or   
 slates. Internally there is much      
 exposed oak and some particularly fine
 old Staircases.Later and more         
 Contemporary buildings are mostly     
 brick built with slate or tile rooves.
 Many modern farmbuildings have steel/ 
 concrete frames, concrete walls,metal 
 or wooden cladding and asbestos rooves</content>
