		<title>10THE ROMAN VILLA,SPARSHOLT.</title>
		<content>  The remains of a Roman villa were    
 excavated by Hampshire Field Club in  
 1965 in West Wood which is part of    
 Crab Wood.Crab Wood is a nature       
 reserve just south of Sparsholt.      
  The most important discovery was a   
 mosaic which is nearly complete.The   
 mosaic is in Winchester Museum.The    
 design consists of a star in the      
 middle surrounded by a key s-shaped   
 pattern and a twisted rope pattern.A  
 square plaited shape surrounds it all.
  In 1978 the school  wanted a badge.  
 While at a service at the church a    
 teacher saw the mosaic design on a    
 kneeler,and altered it for the        
 school.The three sports day teams are 
 named after the shapes on the mosaic. 
 They are Star,Key and Rope.The school 
 sweatshirt and T-shirt have the mosaic
 design on them.
