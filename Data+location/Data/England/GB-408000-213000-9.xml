		<content>   The school buildings are vested in  
 the church but are controlled by the  
 county. Present figures are 3 staff,  
 plus 1 part_time for 2 days and a     
 remedial for 1/2 a day. The school has
 a hall, playground and swimming pool  
 and the use of the town's playing     
 field. The school has many clubs eg.  
 netball, football and recorders.      
 Parents and sixth form girls from the 
 Grammar School help in the classes. In
 the last 5 years the number of pupils 
 has dropped from 120. There has also  
 been a change in the Head Teacher.    
 This summer they are having new       
 terrapins with the old buildings being
 demolished: Also there is the         
 possibility of extending or re_siting 
 the school to provide for any extra   
 pupils resulting from the new         
 developments planned.
