		<title>06Interview with Cllr. R. Hall</title>
		<content> Mr.Ron Hall has been a councillor in  
 Redcar since 1949. He has seen Redcar 
 change over the years. At one time    
 Redcar had its own council and in 1968
 Redcar became part of Teesside.       
 Mr. Hall was elected Mayor in 1971.   
                                       
 In 1974 Redcar became part of         
 Cleveland. Mr. Hall was asked whether 
 Redcar was a better place to live in  
 when it had its own council.          
 Mr. Hall thought that Redcar was      
 better when it had its own council    
 because all the rates collected in    
 Redcar were spent on Redcar alone.    
 When it became part of a bigger       
 council, money had to be spent over a 
 larger area and therefore Redcar      
 didn't get as much attention. Mr. Hall
 also felt that he had more personal   
 contact with the people of Redcar in  
 the past.                             </content>
