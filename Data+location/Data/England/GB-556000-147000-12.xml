		<content> From an interview with a local retired
 couple,we learnt the following.       
 During the war,about the only formal  
 wear was uniform,but when on leave the
 men wore dinner-jackets or tails for  
 dances.When at home,men wore Oxford   
 bags(very wide trousers with turn-ups)
 with jackets or blazers.The women wore
 long-waisted dresses and slightly     
 thicker-soled shoes than today.Before 
 the war the women's hairstyles were   
 cloche hats which had a low brim      
 covering the ears.Men's hats were     
 called trilbys and they were very com-
 mon.In the streets,most men wore      
 suits,usually pin-striped and either  
 black or grey.The women wore long-    
 waisted dresses,floppy hats and shoes 
 with fairly high heels.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
