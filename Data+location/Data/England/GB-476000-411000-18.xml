 ITSELF. SOME FARMERS KEEP{CATTLE}AND{ 
{PIGS}, BUT MAINLY THEY GROW{CEREALS}  
 AND{ROOT}CROPS. SEVERAL FARMERS HAVE  
 CHANGED OVER TO GROWING{"PICK YOUR    
{OWN" CROPS}SUCH AS STRAWBERRIES, AND  
 PEAS WHICH GO FOR PROCESSING.         
  IN GENRAL FEWER PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED  
 IN AGRICULTURE WITH THE INTRODUCTION  
 OF MODERN MACHINERY SUCH AS{POTATO    
{HARVESTERS}AND{PEA VINERS.}           
  MANY FARMERS HAVE REMOVED HEDGES TO  
 FORM LARGER FIELDS.THE SMALLER FARMERS
