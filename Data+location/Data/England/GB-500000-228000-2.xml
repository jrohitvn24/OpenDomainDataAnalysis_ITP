		<title>02LANDSCAPE OF TODDINGTON</title>
		<content>     The rural{landscape}of this area  
 is dominated by the Toddington Manor  
 Farms. This is arable land with woods,
 lakes and Manor grounds. The most up- 
 to-date farming methods and machinery 
 are used. In contrast, there is a     
 collection of vintage farm machinery  
 and some rare breeds of sheep,cattle  
 and goats. Recently the {Manor}itself 
 has been renovated and the grounds    
 restored to their former beauty. There
 is even a cricket pitch there.        
 An interesting feature of Toddington  
 is Conger Hill which is possibly the  
 remains of a motte and bailey{castle}.
 According to legend a witch can be    
 heard frying pancakes beneath the hill
 on Shrove Tuesday.                    
 Another feature of Toddington is the {
{village pond}which was incorporated   
 into a Memorial Garden after the      
 Second World War.                     </content>
