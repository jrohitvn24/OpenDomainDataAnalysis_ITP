    On June 12th, 1985 Father Breandan 
 McDonald celebrated 25 years in the   
 priesthood, which was of great        
 interest to the local community, and  
 preparations for celebrating this     
 event started as far back as March    
 1984. A variety of fund-raising events
 were organized and a Jubilee fund was 
 set up in order that a cheque could be
 presented to Father to show how much  
 local people thought of him.          
    On Tuesday 11th June Father        
 celebrated his first mass of          
 thanksgiving for his Silver Jubilee,  
 this mass was prepared and read by the
 Junior 4 children of Holy Family      
 School. Two Hundred and twenty invited
 guests attended the mass, they        
 included the Mayor and Mayoress of    
 Trafford and some representitives of  
 local parishes and organizations.{    </content>
