		<content>Puppies are chosen at 6 weeks old and  
will be kept in a bed with warm straw  
or shredded paper.They should be fed 4 
times a day because they are growing   
quickly.Two times a day the meal should
be cereal with milk and no sugar and   
the other twshould have liver and meat 
mixed with meal,which has all the      
vitamins and minerals in it.The meat   
and meal should be soaked in hot gravy.
After the meal the puppy should have a 
drink,probably water and milk mixed.   
  When the puppy is settled in,the     
owner can try teasing the puppy with an
old rag.Hopefully the puppy will catch 
hold of the rag and start shaking it   
violently.This means he is getting     
interested.The next stage is to tie a  
piece of string to the rag and pull it 
round the garden,so the puppy gets     
keener at chasing it every day.
