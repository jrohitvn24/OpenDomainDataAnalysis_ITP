 The Vicar of Weedon Lois, Wappenham &amp;

 be used for special occasions,  ie:   
 Christenings, by permission of the oc-

{WESTON BAPTIST CHAPEL}                
 Built in 1780 at a cost of Â£250 for   
 site &amp; buildings, Weston Chapel serves
 15 villages at present.  Every Sunday,
 Morning Service is taken by the

 40 adults &amp; 30 chldren attend.  The   
 venue for evening service rotates be-
