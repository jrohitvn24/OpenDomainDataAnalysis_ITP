		<content> All the farmers prepare land by       
 ploughing, harrowing + the use of     
 artificial fertilsers and slurry.     
 If the farmers grow crops they        
 practise field rotation.The land      
 icluding grass is sprayed to remove   
 docks and thistles or harrowed.       
 The crops are planted in the autumn or
 late march and early April,with seed  
 obtained locally from West Cumberland 
 Farmers.Harvesting is from May to     
 November.The cash crop are sold       
 locally at the farms.
