		<title>01In and around Lacock</title>
		<content> Lacock is in the north of Wiltshire.  
 It is near Melksham, Corsham and      
 Chippenham.  The{River Avon}runs      
 through Lacock and it is quite deep.  
 It is a nice peaceful village and lots
 of{tourists}come to visit it.  They   
 come to see the{abbey, the church, the
{lock-up, the National Trust shop and  
{the tithe barn. The National Trust    
 looks after the village.  There are   
 quite a lot of pubs and a few shops.  
 There are tea-rooms opposite the Red  
 Lion.                                 
 This is a very rural area that relies 
 heavily on{tourism.}Amenities in the  
 area are for the tourists and there   
 is little provision for the           
 inhabitants themselves.
