		<title>05NORMAN THELWELL THE ARTIST</title>
		<content>{     Norman Thelwell,}the famous      
 cartoonist, came from the outskirts of
 Liverpool and has now come to live at 
 Heron's Mead in {Timsbury.}           
      He has written an autobiography  
 and a book about his garden which he  
 has landscaped.  The first book he    
 wrote was{Angels on Horseback}which   
 was published in 1955.  At that time  
 he was teaching in the Wolverhampton  
 College of Art.  Norman Thelwell has  
 published around thirty books.        
      In his school days he says he    
 was only good at art.  Norman         
 Thelwell's cartoons are mostly a      
 comment on the relationship between   
 animals and their owners.  Mr.        
 Thelwell thought that he would have a 
 lot of competition in this art field  
 but found that no one else            
 concentrated on this subject.
