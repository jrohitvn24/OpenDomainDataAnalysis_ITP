		<title>08THE VILLAGE OF SNELLAND</title>
		<content> Snelland is an isolated rural         
 community of about 70 inhabitants.    
 There are 27 dwellings including some 
 modern bungalows and 6 council houses.
 There are almost no amenities-just a  
 telephone box and a letter box. There 
 is no public house, club, school,     
 village hall or playing field.        
                                       
 The village is visited by mobile shops
 including butcher, baker, milkman (4  
 days a week) and library van (every   
 two weeks).  National and local       
 newspapers are delivered daily.       
                                       
 The postman uses a van and not only   
 delivers letters and parcels but also 
 takes letters and will cash giro      
 cheques at Langworth Post Office if   
 asked to do so by householders who    
 cannot make other arrangements.
