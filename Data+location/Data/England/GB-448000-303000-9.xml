		<title>09A Garden In Kirby Muxloe</title>
		<content> We went to visit a lovely garden.It   
 belonged to Mr and Mrs LeMay.We looked
 at the lawn and we could see the      
 ridges and furrows from when the land 
 was ploughed,long ago.Mr and Mrs LeMay
 told us that they needed to spend 5   
 hours on the lawns and 5 hours on the 
 garden each week to keep them looking 
 nice.They had lots of lovely trees and
 a very old hawthorn hedge in the      
 garden.They also had a vegetable      
 garden which I found the most         
 interesting.They grew:-               
 rhubarb,mint,black currants,runner    
 beans,raspberry,cabbage,strawberry,   
 onions,lettuce,carrots,beetroot,broad 
 beans,potatoes,brussel sprouts,and    
 cauliflower                           
      We felt the compost heap and it  
 was quite warm.We could even see steam
 rising from it.Mr and Mrs LeMay were  
 very kind and gave us drinks.{Sarah G.</content>
