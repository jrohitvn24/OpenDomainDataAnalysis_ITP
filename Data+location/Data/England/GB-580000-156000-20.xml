		<title>20HOPES AND FEARS</title>
		<content> I consider myself fortunate to live in
 this beautiful part of Thurnham. From 
 our garden I look out across many     
 thousands of acres of farmland - a    
 peaceful place to retreat from the    
 bustle of everyday life. It is        
 difficult to think ahead but the thing
 that frightens me most is war. I am   
 not pacifist, indeed quite the        
 opposite, but I hope my son may grow  
 up into a peaceful world. Perhaps the 
 energy put in by young people to      
 raising vast sums of money to help the
 starving can be turned into evergy to 
 bring peace to the troubled places of 
 the world eg. Lebanon, India, Ireland.
 Can the young bring to the world a    
 less warlike outlook? I wish I could  
 help to show people that violence is  
 not the answer to all their problems.
