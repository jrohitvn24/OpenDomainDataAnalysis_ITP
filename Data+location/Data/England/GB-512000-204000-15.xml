		<content>{Chiswell Green}is called a 'village'  
 although on the map it seems to be    
 part of St.Albans. The village has, in
 fact, very definite boundaries and a  
 strong sense of identity. There is an 
 active, non-political,{Residents      
{Association}which looks after the     
 general well being of the area and run
 a variety of functions throughout     
 the year. They have organised a system
 of road stewards who may be called    
 upon should someone be in need of help
 or advice and they produce a newsleter
 quarterly to keep the residents       
 informed. The school and church       
 provide the main meeting places either
 for discussion or social events. The  
 shopping area is centrally placed and 
 most daily requirements are catered   
 for.There are three{recreation areas  
 providing play, sport and allotment   
 facilities.                           </content>
