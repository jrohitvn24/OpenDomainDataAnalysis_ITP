		<title>11LIFE ON THE DOLE</title>
		<content>{*** A personal View by TICO TRIKIC ***
      The title of this look at unem-  
 -ployment is not really appropriate.  
 As someone unemployed, I do not live a
 LIFE, it is more like trying to exist 
 on the small means available from the 
 state. Life without work leaves a void
 which is very difficult to fill. Like 
 most unemployed, I trained for a      
 trade, which as well as work was a    
 form of social life, which cannot be  
 replaced by leisure time.             
      Entertaining the children becomes
 very difficult. When employed we had a
 car and most weekends and holidays we 
 went on trips (if only to Bradgate    
 Park or the woods). Now we are rest-  
 -ricted to local parks or the canal. A
 trip to the coast is an event which   
 takes weeks of budgeting for. Facilit-
 -ies for the family unit of unemployed
 is very limited.                      </content>
