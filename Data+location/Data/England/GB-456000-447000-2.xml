		<content> The main streets in both Dringhouses  
 and Woodthorpe are wide and the houses
 have space round them while the       
 streets off the main roads are not so 
 wide as there is less traffic.It is   
 safe for children to play but as usual
 great care should be taken .          
 Woodthorpe tends to be a 'young'      
 population and as yet there is no     
 need for residential homes for the    
 elderly. In Dringhouses there are     
 flats and houses especially for the   
 elderly but they are incorporated with
 the other residents houses.
