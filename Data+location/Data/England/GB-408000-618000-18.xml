		<content>  The school itself has had extensions 
 of cloakrooms and canteen. Storage    
 heaters have replaced black-leaded    
 stoves; vinyl floor covering, carpets 
 and lowered ceilings have been added. 
  Basic mathematics, reading, writing  
 are taught in addition to a wide range
 of other subjects; computer studies,  
 rural science, technology etc.        
 Climbing frames have been installed to
 widen the range of physical activities
 Traditions are also upheld like crafts
 and maypole-dancing.                  
  The children take part in the local  
 community, delivering their harvest   
 gifts to the elderly and sick, baking 
 them short-bread and inviting them to 
 join in school functions and Nativity 
 plays. They visit other schools to see
 Theatre Companies perform or for      
 sport.
