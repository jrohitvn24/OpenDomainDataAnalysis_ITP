		<content> The roads around our block are not    
 very wide so that when lorries come   
 through there is not very much space. 
 There are pot holes which need filling
 in. In the winter the roads are deep  
 in snow and the villages are often cut
 off for short periods.                
 The only main road is the B4077,      
 Tewkesbury to Stow on the Wold,road.  
 The nearest motorway is 15 miles      
 away(M5) and there are mainline       
 railway stations at Moreton in Marsh  
 and Kingham, both of which are about  
 10 miles away.                        
 There is a daily bus service to       
 Cheltenham and a weekly bus to Moreton
 market.
