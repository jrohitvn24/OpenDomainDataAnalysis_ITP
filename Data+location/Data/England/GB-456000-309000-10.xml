		<title>10TREE PLANTING IN BIRSTALL</title>
		<content> A tree planting scheme has been       
 organised by the Parish council and   
 the tree warden, Mr. Boden. Trees are 
 being planted because there are a lot 
 of dead and dying trees in the area.  
 180 have been planted so far, all of  
 them in public view.                  
   {The Methodist Church}is making a   
 book, which contains{information about
{the trees,}where they are planted,    
 what type they are and who paid for   
 them to be planted. The information   
 has been hand written in beautiful    
 script.                               
    Various types of trees have been   
 planted including Eucalyptus, Scots   
 Pine, Purple Beech and Wild Cherry.   
    This type of activity has been     
 going on for a number of years all    
 over the country, not just in         
 Birstall, following the destruction of
 so many elms from Dutch Elm Disease.  </content>
