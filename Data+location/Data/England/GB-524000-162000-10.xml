		<content> As a child I used to play skipping    
 with a long skipping rope stretched   
 across the road in Culvers Way with my
 friends.  We played quite happily for 
 days on end without seeing one car to 
 spoil our game. If we did it was quite
 an event. This type of game would be  
 unthinkable now as there are large    
 numbers of cars using Culvers Way.    
   One especially nice treat for me as 
 a child was when my father used to    
 take me to Mill Lane - outside the    
 Lord Palmerston Public House to see   
 the Morris Dancers.This was a regular 
 local treat for all the family, one   
 that is sadly missed by me now.       
   Carshalton Hand Laundry used to be  
 between North House and West Street.As
 children we used to see all the sheets
 hanging out to dry on what appeared to
 be hundreds and hundreds of washing   
 lines.The laundry no longer exists.   </content>
