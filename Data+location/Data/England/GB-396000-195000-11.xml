		<title>11THE WESTERN LANGUAGE CENTRE</title>
		<content> The{Western Language Centre}had been a
 farm, then a doctor's surgery and     
 finally a library for books on the war
 before it became a language school. 35
 qualified teachers work at the school 
 and six languages are taught:{English,
{French, German, Italian, Spanish and  
{Portuguese.}Students of 11 nations    
 come to study here. The courses are   
 normally from 1 - 16 weeks long for   
 private students and groups. The      
 students stay with host families or in
 Hotels. The students are all in       
 technical or managerial jobs and      
 industrial visits are included in the 
 study programme. For relaxation and   
 variety, the school organises theatre 
 visits, tourist trips, folk singing,  
 pub visits, parties and sports.
