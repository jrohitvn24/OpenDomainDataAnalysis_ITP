		<title>08BADGERS IN ST.WENN AREA</title>
		<content>  In{Blackhay woods}we found a{badgers 
 sett in some brambles and we started  
 to break them down. We managed to get 
 in by the sett. It smelled funny.     
                                       
  I started to count the{exits.}I      
 managed to count{eighteen.}We did not 
 see or hear any{badgers}but there was 
 a big hole in a hedge about six foot  
 above the ground some distance away.  
 There was also a toilet there.It was a
 hole dug in the ground. Near the exits
 there was straw and hay where the     
 badgers had changed their bedding.It  
 was interesting to see all this.      
                                       
   We also saw some scratching on the  
 trees. It was not near the{badgers    
{sett.}They do that to mark out their  
 territory.
