		<content> Before 1935, there were not many      
dwellings in the area, apart from large
houses,cottages for estate and farm    
workers.There were a few timber-framed 
chalet bungalows, often built by their 
owners on huge plots of land.Living was
primitive, as there were no roads,     
drains,lighting or water,although wells
were easily sunk in the clay.          
Residential development really dates   
from 1927,when a builder called        
Christmas bought land cheaply, and put 
up many small two-bedroomed bungalows  
in Bricket Wood.He provided his own    
water-supply and sewerage system.In the
same village,in 1955-6,Blackboy Wood   
Estate was built by Handley Page       
Aircraft Co.Ltd (established at nearby 
Colney Street).After that,as           
communications with London and other   
towns was excellent, the area developed
rapidly.                               </content>
