		<title>11FARMING</title>
		<content>  The area surveyed is mainly devoted  
 to agriculture. The farms are usually 
 between 2-300 acres and are concerned 
 with stock rearing both sheep and     
 cattle. This means that the land cover
 is intensively managed grassland with 
 some rough pasture on poorly drained  
 land especially in the north along the
 flood plain of the River Irthing. Some
 crops such as rape and turnip are     
 grown and grass is cut for hay.       
 Although there are some dairy herds,  
 the majority of cattle are            
 Fresian-Hereford cross bred for meat. 
 All stock is sold at 2 years old. The 
 cattle are kept outside for most of   
 the year while the grass continues to 
 grow but are brought inside for       
 winter. The cows calve during January 
 and February whilst the cows are      
 inside and then all the cattle are    
 taken outside when the weather permits</content>
