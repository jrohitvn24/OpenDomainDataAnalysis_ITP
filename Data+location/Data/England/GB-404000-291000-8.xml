		<content> St.John the Evangelist,Perry Barr is  
150 years old and is the oldest church 
in the area.At present it is being     
restored as it in urgent need of       
preservation due to weathering.The     
graveyard is overgrown and is also     
being attended to.A local firm,        
Sandicliffe,has agreed to sponsor      
restoration work from the sale of each 
new Ford car.  St.Matthews was built   
out of the living of St.John's church  
in the late 1930's.The original        
building is now used as a church hall  
and a modern 7-sided building was      
consecrated in 1964. There is an       
active congregation of about 80        
communicants each Sunday with services 
held in the chapel every day.  Perry   
Beeches Methodist Hall has a thriving  
congregation and so too does the       
Baptist Church,with a Boys Brigade band
