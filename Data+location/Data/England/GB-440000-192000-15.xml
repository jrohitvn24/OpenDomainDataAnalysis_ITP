 The church was built in Norman times. 
It has an old Norman door way. There is
also a Norman door way leading out to  
the grave yard. Inside the church there
are two Saxon coffins. There are some  
old stained glass windows. On the      
floor near the altar there are several 
fine brasses of old Hanney families.   
{Saint James the Less}                 
 Saint James the less was an old church
in East Hanney, but two years ago it   
was sold and converted into a house.   
The grave stones are still around the  
garden.                                
{The Mission}                          
 The mission in East Hanney is a free  
evangelical church. They have services 
on Sunday's, Sunday school, and a      
Tuesday club. In the summer holidays   
they are running a bible club.
