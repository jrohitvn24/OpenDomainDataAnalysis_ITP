		<content>The area is divided into two main      
groups-1) council built homes and 2)   
privately owned homes. Many people     
living in council houses are now buying
their homes rather than renting. There 
are three old established residential  
areas-1) Pye Green 2) Greenheath and 3)
High Town. All these areas have been   
expanded with new housing developments.
New council houses have been built and 
older houses re-modernised. A large new
estate of privately owned properties is
being built at Richmond Hill on land   
between Greenheath Rd and Pye Green Rd 
linking these two  areas. The majority 
of houses are semi-detached with some  
detached houses and bungalows. There   
are no multi-story blocks of flats. All
homes have indoor bathrooms and toilets
with hot and cold water.All homes have 
a minimum of 5 rooms,the majority have 
7 or more rooms.                       </content>
