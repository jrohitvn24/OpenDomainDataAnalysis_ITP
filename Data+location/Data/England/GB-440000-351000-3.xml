		<content>   On Sunday morning my sister and I   
 went to Sunday School straight after  
 breakfast. When we came home we had to
 tidy our bedroom and help mum get the 
 dinner ready.                         
   After dinner it was my sister's turn
 to wipe the dishes, while I played on 
 our skateboard with my brother. We all
 went a walk right round the reservoir 
 then we had tea early.                
   Sunday night we had a quiz game then
 I went in the bath.My dad went to work
 so I watched football for him.Mexico  
 won 1_0.Then at 9 o'clock I went to   
 bed.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
