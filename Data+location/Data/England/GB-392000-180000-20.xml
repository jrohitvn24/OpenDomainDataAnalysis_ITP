		<content> During one lifetime the way of life of
 people in this area has changed       
 dramatically.Generations of families  
 worked on the land.Modern technology  
 has changed that.Labour intensive     
 farming has given way to mechanised   
 farms run by one or two men.At the    
 same time transport has improved      
 beyond anything imaginable a hundred  
 years ago enabling people to commute  
 daily to London or Bristol.Televised  
 local and national news bulletins have
 replaced the shared newspaper which   
 took a week to be passed around the   
 community,having been brought from    
 Chippenham by a Nestles worker.The    
 ownership of the land has changed from
 the vast Draycott Estate to a number  
 of individuals.People no longer need  
 to be servile.This community is very  
 much part of the modern world.
