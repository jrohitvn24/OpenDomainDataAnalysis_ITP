		<content>     We ran out of deisel so we pushed 
it to the petrol station and we filled 
up the tank.  Whenever I go on the     
school bus it smells of perfume.  We   
have a driver on our bus.  We have     
curtains on our little minibus.  It is 
bumpy across the moors.  We can see    
through the windows.  We have a radio. 
There are speakers so we can listen to 
the music. We have a floor on our      
minibus which squeaks a bit when you   
walk on it. There are nineteen seats   
and one emergency door.                
{Wetton and Grindon Fetes}             
     The Wetton fete this year was held
on 29th June.  Although it rained, a   
lot of people turned up and crammed    
into the old schoolrooms.  There were  
competitions like Guess the weight of  
the bull and a fancy dress.  Wetton    
fair is being held on the playing      
fields this year.                      </content>
