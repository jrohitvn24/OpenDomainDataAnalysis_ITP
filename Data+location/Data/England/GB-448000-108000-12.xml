		<title>12     Strawberries</title>
		<content> Strawberries have always played a     
 major role in our community. From     
 around 1864 the surrounding areas     
 started to grow them.The main strain  
 of strawberry in this country is      
 Gauntlet but others also include      
 Talisman,Vanguard and Soverign.       
                                       
 In the months of May,June and July    
 almost everybody is involved with     
 picking,packing and selling.          
 Nowadays most strawberries in the area
 are brought on under glass,because the
 Hampshire strawberries have to be on  
 the market before the Kent counties,  
 when the Kent strawberries are put on 
 the market it is flooded and there is 
 no selling room for Hampshires.       
                                       
 Some of the strawberry growers have   
 had their business's past down over   
 the generations.                      </content>
