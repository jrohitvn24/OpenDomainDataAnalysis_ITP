		<content>      The name Marden is a legacy      
 of the Iron Age Celts, the Cymry, or  
 Welsh tribes who inhabited some of the
 many hillforts prevalent in this      
 region.The name Marden is derived from
 Mawarddin (Maurdin, Maurdyn, etc.),   
 themselves corruptions of Mawr Ddinas,
 Welsh for a large fort. As the reputed
 headquarters of Offa King of Mercia,  
 Sutton Walls, is in the Parish of     
 Marden it might seem connected with   
 this. Etymologically, however, it     
 appears to owe its origins to Dinmore 
 Hill, as Dinmore is another variation 
 on the theme of Dinas and Mawr. The   
 roots of the village of Marden go a   
 fair way down into the soils of time. 
 Soil is really the keyword for this   
 area as it contains some of the       
 richest farmland in the country.      
 Marden is surrounded by little        
 hamlets, all one-time farming centres.</content>
