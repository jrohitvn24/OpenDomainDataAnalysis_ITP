		<title>07SOLTON MANOR FARM</title>
		<content> The farm is mentioned in the original 
 Survey of 1086 where it is called     
 Soltone but the settlement predates   
 this. The name derives from the Saxon 
 for "Muddy pool farmstead". Situated  
 in a hollow in the chalk a dew pond   
 was the possible reason for the       
 collection of water. Today it is no   
 longer family owned as most farms in  
 the area are but by a combined based  
 in Folkestone. Originally a mixed farm
 with cattle,sheep and cereals it has  
 changed to producing mainly oil seed  
 rape,with some livestock. This is     
 undoubtedly due to the large subsidy  
 that the E.E.C. place on the crop. The
 whole area is now yellow with the     
 flowers in the early summer. A highly 
 mechanised farm the farm manager      
 no longer lives in the farmhouse which
 has been sold for private occupation.
