		<title>01LIFE ON DANESHOLME</title>
		<content> I live on the estate called Danesholme
 .I live at 53 Norse Walk.It is a part 
 of the old part of Danesholme.It is on
 the outskirts near Copenhagon         
 Road.Near my house is the new shops.  
 There is the library,newsagents,the   
 chemist,the Co-op,an Off Licence and a
 pub.Life is pretty easy going because 
 the school,shops and bus stops are    
 very near.The estate is quite new.The 
 school is very good because it has a  
 lot of different things going on.There
 are clubs for children,scouts and cubs
 down at te old farm house.There is a  
 park with swings and a good adventure 
 course.Life is very nice on           
 Danesholme.We have got friendly and   
 helpful neighbours.We all get on well.
                                       
 Occaissionally some stupid people come
 and cause trouble and do damage to the
 area,sometimes the police come.       </content>
