		<title>17Methodist Chapel, Farcet</title>
		<content>   We went to visit the Methodist      
 Chapel in{Farcet.}The buiding was put 
 up in 1908.In the foundations is a jar
 containing the names of children who  
 helped to collect silver three-penny  
 pieces to provide money for the       
 building.Before the present chapel was
 built,people met together in a        
 building in Middle Street.This is now 
 a house.                              
   In the chapel there are seats for   
 about one hundred and fifty people.As 
 well as two sevices each Sunday there 
 is a Sunday School, and a chidren's   
 group meets on Thursday.The minister  
 who takes the services has a chapel at
 Whittlesey too.The chapel is heated   
 with a coke-burning stove.At the back 
 of the chapel is a school room and a  
 kitchen.
