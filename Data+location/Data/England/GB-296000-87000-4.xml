		<title>04INDUSTRY IN TOPSHAM</title>
		<content> The building of large industrial      
 estates in Exeter has meant that many 
 of Topsham's industries have moved    
 away to better premesis. Until 1984   
 there was a clock factory in the heart
 of Topsham which made modern clocks   
 and employed craftsmen to repair old  
 clocks and watches. Likewise, a small 
 glove factory making gloves for       
 industry has moved away. On the quay  
 the fish factory still operates,      
 processing and smoking fish for local 
 use and for export. There is a depot  
 which handles crates of lager and a   
 boatyard which builds and repairs     
 boats by hand. Some of Topsham's small
 industries include a doll-maker, a    
 furniture maker and restorer , a shoe 
 repairer and a tailor.
