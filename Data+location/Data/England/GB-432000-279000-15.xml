		<content> At the Puran Masih (Full Moon) it is  
 our custom to celebrate Guru Nanak's  
 birthday. People from all over the    
 British Isles come to Coventry every  
 month.The Guru Granth, the Holy Book, 
 is read for 2 and a half days. When it
 is finished there are prayers and     
 songs.Fresh, colourful flowers are    
 thrown over the Granth together with  
 many colourful cloths.Then Baba Ji,   
 the High Priest,sits on the           
 platform.He preaches and tells stories
 from the Granth.You listen carefully  
 and you can always find a meaning for 
 yourself.You think if you are living a
 good life and how you can improve to  
 be nearer to God.We thank God,ask Him 
 to bless the food,we pray then we go  
 to the dining room to eat, meet our   
 friends and talk in our language,     
 Punjabi.                              
                                       </content>
