		<title>08BUS SERVICES IN DEARNE AREA</title>
		<content>{Wombwell Bus Station}is the one that  
 deals with the services in our area.  
 24 buses run through Goldthorpe each  
 day.  The bus fares are the{cheapest }
 in the country, a child can travel    
 nine miles for just 2p and it is also 
 very cheap for adults.                
 There is not really a lot of serious  
 vandalism in our area but buses are   
 written on and damaged in small ways  
 quite often.                          
 The bus service is quite good as they 
 run frequent bus services on time.
