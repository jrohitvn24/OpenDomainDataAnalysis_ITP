    The Mendip Hills are worth         
 approximately Â£30,000,000,000         
 containing as they do, 40,000 million 
 tons of limestone. The potential      
 environmental damage is enormous.     
    For many centuries stone has been  
 quarried on the Mendips. When         
 quarrying first started, the stone was
 only used locally for buildings and   
 tracks. Most of the Mendips' natural  
 crags and small cliffs are modified in
 a special way, especially in places   
 where the stone was used for building.
    Later as transport improved,       
 quarries grew in size and number to   
 supply stone for roads, bridges and   
 railways as well as buildings. The    
 largest and best known quarries on    
 Mendip are at Dulcote, Vobster, Gurney
 Slade, Water Lip, Emborough, Windsor  
 Hill, Under Wood and Draycott.        </content>
