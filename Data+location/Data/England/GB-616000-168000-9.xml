		<title>09OLD PEOPLE IN HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> Of the profusion of homes for the     
 elderly in Herne Bay some are classed 
 as nursing homes with qualified nurses
 on the staff and these homes admit    
 people with medical problems. Nursing 
 homes cost up to Â£280 a week while the
 regular old people's homes varied     
 between Â£100 and Â£170 per week. When  
 people's money had been used up the   
 State would continue to pay the bills.
 Some homes usually had vacancies but  
 for the ones with a good reputation   
 there would usually be a waiting list.
 If old people were capable they would 
 be free to go round the town during   
 the day and if confined to the home   
 they might watch T.V., knit, play     
 cards or read. The age range of these 
 people would usually be from 70 to 100
 years. Facilities offered in these    
 homes included lifts, hoists and mini 
 buses.                                </content>
