		<title>14LEISURE TIME IN WIMBORNE</title>
		<content> My Mum and Dad play tennis in their   
 spare time, my Mum also plays darts.  
 Dad likes photography, he develops    
 films himself and mounts them into    
 slides. My brother Derek enjoys       
 fishing at the Stock ponds and in the 
 river at Wimborne. He also uses a     
 metal detector and makes things with  
 his electric set. On Monday evenings  
 he goes to Cubs. I like knitting and I
 go to athletics coaching. After school
 I play football, rugby and rounders   
 with my friends. On Thursdays I go to 
 Brownies and cycling proficiency. Mum 
 knits a lot of things for the family. 
 When I go to bed and when I wake up in
 the morning my favourite occupation is
 reading a book. My hobby is collecting
 postcards, I have mounted 365 cards   
 into a book and I have a few more as  
 well.
