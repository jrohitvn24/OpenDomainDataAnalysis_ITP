		<title>01Around Todmorden Moor</title>
		<content> The area is basically{sandstone and}  
{millstone grit.}The stone has been    
 quarried locally and still is today on
 a relatively small scale.The stone has
 been used in local housing and mills  
 and the poorer quality stone has been 
 used in the past in dry stone walls to
 enclose the open{moorland}as rough    
 pasture for the{sheep farming}which is
 predominant in the area.The land is   
 very poor quality and a local area is 
 known as{Sourhall}due to its poor     
 nature.In the past much of the area   
 would have been covered in{deciduous  
{forest}but this has long since        
 disappeared although the forestry     
 commission has recently begun to      
 re-plant the area in pine trees.Very  
 few roads cross the moor and the      
 houses are very scattered being farm  
 dwellings in the past but more        
 recently being private houses.        </content>
