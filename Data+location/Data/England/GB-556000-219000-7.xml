		<title>07THE A120</title>
		<content> The A120 is one of the busiest roads  
 in Essex.  It stretches from          
 Puckeridge to the outskirts of        
 Colchester and it cuts Takeley into   
 two pieces.  It is very dangerous and 
 there is only one safe place to cross.
 This is at the traffic lights but even
 there the lights are green for only 30
 seconds.  Elderly people and mums with
 young children are frightened to cross
 the road.  The pavement is so narrow  
 in places that the suction from heavy 
 lorries could affect your balance and 
 on wet days the spray soaks           
 pedestrians.  Noise is another problem
 for those who live near the A120.     
 Accidents happen frequently, causing  
 long tailbacks; these accidents often 
 occur because people exceed the 40 mph
 speed limit.  This is how we see the  
 A120 but with the expansion of        
 Stansted Airport, its use may change. </content>
