 Coulter Electronics is situated in    
 Marsh Farm, which is very unusual     
 because this is a housing area.It is  
 the only industry in Marsh Farm.      
 Coulter Electronics moved into the    
 purpose built factory several years   
 ago from Harpenden because they needed
 more room. They manufacture specialist
 hospital equipment to do with         
 Haematology.                          
 The company employs approximately five
 hundred workers in this very modern   
 fctory. The products are distributed  
 throughout the British Isles and the  
 rest of the world.
