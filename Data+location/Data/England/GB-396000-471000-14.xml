		<content> Scargill House - Once privately owned,
 this is now a Christian Guest House   
 and Conference Centre.  It is a fine  
 stone-built complex with a            
 Scandinavian type chapel, clearly     
 visible on the  Conistone road out of 
 the village.  Since 1958 it has housed
 a community of young men and women    
 working together who share their faith
 with visitors and friends.  There are 
 ninety acres of woodland and meadow,  
 backed by limestone outcrops.Up to 90 
 guests can be catered for in beautiful
 accommodation, extended to include an 
 octagonal lounge and new bedroom      
 blocks.  "Specialised" weeks are      
 organised for all ages.               
   The Community often share in worship
 in the village church, and help with  
 activities as far as their commitments
 allow, inviting villagers each year to
 a specially devised party.            </content>
