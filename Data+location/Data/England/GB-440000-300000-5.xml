		<content> Several properties have undergone     
 extensive renovation, a particular    
 example being Church Farm, a l6th     
 /17th century, two storey, timber     
 framed farmhouse with outbuildings,   
 which although previously neglected is
 now restored to pristine condition.   
 Directly opposite the Church stands   
 Jasmine Cottage, built in 1865 as the 
 schoolroom, it continued as such until
 the 1940's when the school closed and 
 the cottage was adapted for           
 residential occupation.               
 Church Cottage is a fine example of   
 mediaeval architecture.               
                                       
 The more modern properties of Cadeby  
 are mainly of bungalow configuration, 
 the most interesting of which is      
 generally held to be Wilderness House,
 with its unusual flat roofed structure
 and tree screened frontage.           </content>
