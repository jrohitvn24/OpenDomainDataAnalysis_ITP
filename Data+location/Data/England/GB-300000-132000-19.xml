		<title>19FARMING AND HORSES</title>
		<content> Most of the farms in the area own some
 machinery. All will have a tractor    
 although some of these are quite old, 
 at least 25 years.                    
 Larger machinery such as balers       
 and combines may be hired and we even 
 saw a mobile sheep dip. This was a    
 large lorry that drives round to the  
 fields where the sheep are so they do 
 not need to be brought to the farm for
 dipping. A policeman has to check     
 each dipping session to see that the  
 sheep have been properly treated.     
                                       
 In addition to the gymkana run by of  
 the local farms there is also a pony  
 club meeting in July near King's      
 Brompton Common. In spite of the      
 isolated position this was very well  
 attended in 1985, we saw at least     
 twenty horse boxes in the field.
