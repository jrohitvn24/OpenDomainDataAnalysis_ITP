		<content> The two primary schools we visited    
 were Collingham and East Keswick. Most
 children like school because of       
 playtimes. They do P.E., English and  
 Scottish Maths. Scottish Maths is a   
 maths scheme that goes from the       
 beginning to the end of primary       
 school. Pupils do topics in Reading   
 and Artwork. Outside the classroom    
 they plant seeds and go swimming. the 
 class numbers vary from 20 to 30      
 pupils per class. Pupils don't like   
 Writing. They like Reading and        
 Artwork. Special events include       
 Christmas parties, coffee mornings,   
 Easter egg competitions, fetes,       
 jumble sales, maypole dancing, pig    
 roasts and strawberry fayre.
