		<title>16Beverley Beck</title>
		<content> On Beverley Beck most of the boats are
 motor cruisers,there are a few yachts 
 and very few dinghys. You can see     
 cargo ships on the River Hull;a few   
 from Beverley,but they come mainly    
 from Whitby. On the Beck there is one 
 light ship and a new wharf which has a
 crane on it. Beside the Beck there is 
 an art gallery next door to the       
 lock-keepers cottage. The lock is not 
 used very regularly these days so the 
 lock-keeper has more free time to     
 follow his own interests.             
      Alongside the Beck there is a    
 boat-yard that builds and repairs     
 barges and other boats. On the Beck   
 itself you can see swans, ducks and   
 one goose.
