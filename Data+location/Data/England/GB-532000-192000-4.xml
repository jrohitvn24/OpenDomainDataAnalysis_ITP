		<content> Hairstyles come and go. Most of the   
 styles are to do with a flicked       
 fringe. The most common one is called 
 a wedge and the common colours for    
 hair is brown and blond. Although you 
 do get the odd pink or green colour,  
 but that is only really "punks" that  
 wear it.                              
 Long hair is in fashion for girls who 
 are under twelve, but over that age   
 there aren't many girls with hair     
 below their shoulders.                
 All boys styles are the same, that is 
 the normal short back and             
 sides.Occasionally you see a boy with 
 hair below his shoulders, but that    
 isn't very often.
