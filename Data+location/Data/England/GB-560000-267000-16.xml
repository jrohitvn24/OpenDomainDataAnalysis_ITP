		<title>16Buses. Fordham to Burwell.</title>
		<content>   There are 8 buses a day going from  
 Fordham to Burwell. The first one is  
 at 08.01 and the last at 18.40. There 
 are 10 buses going from  Burwell to   
 Fordham. The first is at 07.16 and the
 last at 18.55. There are not any      
 real bus stops in our area but you can
 stand on the road and stick your hand 
 out and the bus should stop. They use 
 double deckers and single deckers.    
 The double decker can hold 74 people  
 and the single decker 53 people. The  
 fare is 85p for adults and 43p for    
 children. There were 9 people on the  
 bus that left Burwell at 13.31: 3     
 teenagers, 4 ladies and  2 men. 3     
 people travelled on the bus every day.
 For one person it was the first time  
 they had been on the bus. Most people 
 got off at Fordham or Soham. They were
 going home from work or school.
