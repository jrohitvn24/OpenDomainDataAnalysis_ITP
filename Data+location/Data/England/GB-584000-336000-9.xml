		<title>09NORTH CREAKE LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> This is a pre-Conquest village, with a
 Saxon Lord in the days of the Danelaw.
 Of the three Norman Manors, two are   
 now in the possession of Cambridge    
 University Colleges; the third is the 
 property of Earl Spencer.             
 There were two medieval churches, St  
 Michaels, ruined at the Dissolution,  
 and the existing St Mary's Church.    
 The latter was rebuilt in its present 
 form in the fifteenth century.        
 The outlines of two of the Manor      
 Houses may be traced in fields        
 opposite the Church.  This suggests   
 that the original settlement was      
 developed in this area, alongside the 
 River Burn.  The village spread was to
 the North, so the Church is close to  
 the Southern boundary of the parish.  
 N Creake is a good example of a linear
 village, the pattern being similar to 
 that shown on a map of 1600.          </content>
