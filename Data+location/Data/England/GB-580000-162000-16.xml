 Hartlip is a beautiful village in the 
 heart of Kent.Here lives the head of a
 large building company.He was         
 interviewed and asked to comment on   
 house building today.He said thet     
 there is a trend away from building   
 big estates.New houses today fall into
 3 groups.Firstly starter homes for    
 young people qualifying for 100%      
 mortgages.These homes are fully fitted
 &amp; there are few extras to find.       
 Secondly homes for retired people with
 wardens nearby.Previosly homes for the
 elderly were council owned.Thirdly    
 larger houses with luxury             
 facilities.These may be copies of     
 period houses. Planning restictions   
 are now strict. Tax has to be added to
 extra building work.However many      
 extend rather than have the expense of
 moving.                               </content>
