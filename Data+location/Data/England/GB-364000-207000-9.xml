		<title>09SEVERN VALLEY WOODWORKS</title>
		<content>   This is one of the few light        
 industries of the area and is situated
 alongside the A48 trunk road. It      
 employs 42 people and produces        
 packing cases to house rifles and     
 warheads (Ministry of Defence) and    
 pallettes (for Heinz - major producer 
 of food - not local). The woodworks   
 use only softwoods, all from other    
 countries (Russia,Poland,Sweden,      
 Ireland,Canada) and it uses 4 forklift
 trucks and 2 lorries (32 tonnes).     
 Various saws are used: bandsaw (10ft  
 long),circular (6ft diameter) and     
 modern methods are employed for       
 joining wood together - high-velocity 
 nail guns.Fifteen packing cases and 20
 pallettes are made, on average, each  
 day. The woodworks, still known as    
 'the coffin works', is housed in four 
 different buildings each used for a   
 different aspect of the production.   </content>
