		<title>06PRINCIPLE FEATURES EASTLEIGH</title>
		<content>  The predominant feature of Eastleigh 
 is the railway which is given a full  
 page.                                 
  Through the centre of the block ,to  
 the east of the town is the{River     
{Itchen}which is a typical Hampshire   
 trout stream.                         
  There is a interesting remnant of the
 canal age still existing.The{Itchen   
{Navigation Canal}is still a waterway  
 but there are no surviving locks.It   
 can be traced from Southampton to     
 Winchester.                           
  The centre of Eastleigh is at present
 undergoing great changes.A large      
 covered shopping precinct is planned  
 for the future and a lot of old       
 buildings are at present being        
 demolished to make way for it.
