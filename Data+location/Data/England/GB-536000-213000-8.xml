		<title>08LIVING IN WARE</title>
		<content> In Ware the shops are really          
 interesting.Some of them used to be   
 inns.I like looking at the shops at   
 weekends and reading books to find out
 what they used to be.In the summer I  
 like going fishing with my dad at the{
{Priory}.In the winter I see {Ware Town
{Football Club.}Best of all I like {   
{Ware Week}.There is a fair,a fete,a   
 fun run and you can go up {St.Mary's} 
 bell tower.                           
      {Ware} is a very old town dating 
 back to pre_Domesday times.Every trip 
 into the town is a trip into the past,
 which makes it very pleasant.{Ware}is 
 still a town of small shops.Many      
 modern shops are behind old shop      
 facades.During the last decade much   
 has been done to preserve the old     
 buildings and enhance its appearance. 
 We have country fresh air and we are  
 near to{London}.                      </content>
