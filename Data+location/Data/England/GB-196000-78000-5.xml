		<title>05The Coastguard</title>
		<content>      Port Isaac coastguard is paid    
 from government taxes. They get Â£1.85 
 an hour.People phone 999 and are put  
 through to Falmouth. Then Falmouth    
 phone Mr.Castle,the local coastguard, 
 and when they say "Immediate" it      
 means a life saving call.             
 Other ways of finding out if people   
 are in danger is by the radio or      
 flares. If 1 maroon is set off it     
 means the cliff rescue team must go   
 out, if 2 go off it means the life    
 boat must go out and 3 means they     
 both go out. On a cliff rescue the    
 helicopter from Culdrose or Cavanah   
 goes out, the lifeboat goes out, the  
 ambulance and the cliff team all go   
 out.If you are swimming or have fallen
 in and are in danger they swim out.   
 There are 18 part time coastguards.The
 coastguard covers the beaches between 
 Tintagel Head and the River Camel     </content>
