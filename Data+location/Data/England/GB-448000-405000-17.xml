		<content> The{bus}fares in our area are cheap   
 anyone over five years old pays two   
 pence until they are sixteen.Old age  
 pensioners have free passes to travel 
 anywhere on the{bus}.Running through  
 our area is part of the M1 motorway.  
 Also there is a demolished{train}track
 that had not been used for many years.
 There are a lot of heavy lorries all  
 over the coutry roads.They are mostly 
 coal{lorries}and large mining         
 equipment as well as large farming    
 machinery.The{lorries}are using our   
 country lanes and riding through the  
 little villages.There were lots of    
 police conveys about during the miners
 strike.The Five Lane Ends at Pickburn 
 is very dangerous as well as the      
 junction at Marr.All the roads in our 
 area have to carry a lot of traffic   
 and apart from the main Doncaster to  
 Barnsley road aren't really suitable. </content>
