		<title>13Footpaths South of Oakley</title>
		<content> Several numbered{bridleways and foot- 
{paths}are clearly signposted and used 
 frequently for leisure. One bridleway 
 runs north from{Southwood Farm}and    
 skirts the west of Kempshott until it 
 joins{Kempshott Lane.}A footpath      
 skirts the south-westerly edge of     
{South Wood}across fairly high farmland
 with good views to the north-west. It 
 passes the eastern fringe of{Bull's   
{Bushes Copse,}crosses the railway     
 line, via a bridge, then into Oakley, 
 emerging opposite the{Post Office.    
 A bridleway runs from east to west of 
 the area crossing{Pardown}and skirting
 the north of Bull's Bushes Copse      
 before going on to{Steventon.}Seven   
 other shorter paths are located within
 the area including those at Kempshott 
 Park crossing the golf course and the 
 motorway,{Oakley Park,}South Wood,    
{Breach Farm}and three at{Peak Copse.} </content>
