<title>25The Ark, Tadcaster</title>
<content>

The Ark Museum finally closed in 1989 due to inability to pay the rent to John Smiths (then owned by Fosters). Artefacts were returned to John Smiths, the Castle Museum, York, and Doncaster Museum (whence came the famous sturgeon). Some items were returned to private lenders and societies. Other items went into storage where they still reside (10/10/2011). A mortgage was arranged to buy the building. Fosters then withdrew the offer for sale and the Ark stood empty until the Town Council bought it in 1992 for use as an office and meeting place. Thus expired the only museum in Selby District.   &lt;br />
