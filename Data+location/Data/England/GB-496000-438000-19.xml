		<content> In the last few years everyone has    
 become aware of the conflict between  
 modern farming and wildlife           
 conservation. FWAG (Farming and       
 Wildlife Advisory Group) was set up in
 the 1970's to try to make farmers     
 aware of the problems, to give        
 practical advice to farmers wanting to
 accommodate wildlife on their farms   
 and to educate the public. North      
 Humberside FWAG  was the first group  
 set up, its meetings being held at    
 Bishop Burton College of Agriculture  
 and attracting farmers from all around
 the county. A FWAG advisor has this   
 year been appointed to visit farms and
 advise farmers.  A seminar on land use
 was held at the college in November,  
 1985 and attracted over 60 people. It 
 was chaired by the TV personality,    
 author and landscape architect, Chris 
 Baines.                               </content>
