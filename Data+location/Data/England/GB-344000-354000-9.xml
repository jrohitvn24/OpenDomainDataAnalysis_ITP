		<title>09Our Visit To A Pheasantry</title>
		<content> When we were in the park we were met  
 by the children of the gamekeeper who 
 are two pupils  at our school. When we
 got to the bank above the pheasantry  
 we could see lots of wire fencing     
 everywhere. There are about 1-2 acres 
 of pens. Around the wire is an        
 electric fence to keep the foxes out. 
 First we went to look for the hidden  
 eggs.I found an egg which had been    
 pecked by a jackdaw or magpie.  Next  
 we saw two of the chickens which we   
 had reared in school in March which   
 are now three months old. After       
 collecting the eggs they are washed   
 and this is a complicated procedure.  
 The eggs are put in a basket then into
 a bucket of hot water with detergent  
 in it. A machine shakes the bucket and
 the eggs come out shining. After three
 weeks in an incubator the eggs hatch  
 and the day old chicks are sent away. </content>
