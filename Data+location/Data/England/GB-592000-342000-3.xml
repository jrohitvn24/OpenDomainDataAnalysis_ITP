		<title>03STIFFKEY RIVER WELLS NORFOLK</title>
		<content>The river poses an interesting         
question.                              
Instead of a flood plain,leading to a  
marshland estury with the mouth pushed 
to the west by longshore drift,there is
a narrow gorge in which lies the       
village of Stiffkey,within 2 kms of the
sea.                                   
The contours in grid squares 9343 and  
9442 indicate the normal shape of a    
river mouth  in 1953 the sea inundated 
the marshes as far as GR 945 424.These 
facts seem to sugest that the river may
once have flowed to the sea this way.  
Why was it deflected?                  
Perhaps at the end of the Ice Age, ice 
blocked the area of the old mouth and  
the dammed up water found a spill way  
over the watershed to the east, carved 
a gorge and a new course for the river.
