		<title>15FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.</title>
		<content>   July 1985.                          
                                       
   The only development in the area at 
 present is the further extension to   
 the{Saltergate}Estate on the western  
 side of the area. This now stretches  
 up the Skipton Road nearly to         
 Killinghall Moor Farm at Four Lane    
 Ends (the junction of the A59 and the 
 B6161).                               
   Future plans at present being       
 discussed include the building of a   
 northern-bypass across the north of   
 the Bilton area and futher housing and
 and industrial and commercial         
 development along the route.  As this 
 is in the present{Green Belt}between  
 Harrogate and Knaresborough this is   
 being vigorously opposed by residents 
 of this area.                         
                                       
                                       </content>
