		<content>  The railway through Alne is mainly   
 used by passengers. It is a track for 
 diesel locomotives but later it will  
 be electrified. There are four lines, 
 two to the North and two to the South,
 they connect the South of England to  
 Scotland and pass through York.       
                                       
                                       
 The survey was carried out between 2  
 and 3pm for 5 days. On average we saw 
 4 inter-city express trains a day, 3  
 coal trains and 1 tanker train,most   
 trains were travelling South.         
   At one time there was a station in  
 Alne and you could catch a train to   
 Easingwold but now the site is used as
 a builders yard and parking for       
 a haulage firm.
