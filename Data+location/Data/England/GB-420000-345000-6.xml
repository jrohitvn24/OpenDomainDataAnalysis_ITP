		<content> As you come down{Yew Tree lane}after  
 you pass the{church and hall. }On     
 the left stands the{school,}built in  
 1873.The{church}built it for the      
 education of 140 pupils.This is quite 
 astonishing when you see the amount of
 room provided inside.At present there 
 are 46 pupils.The bell and tower still
 remain on the roof of the             
 building but are no longer in use.At  
 the back of the{ school}is a play     
 ground which is used by the           
 children.It has a climbing            
 frame,hopscotch and two pitches for   
 school games.In the centre the old    
 toilet has been turned into a place   
 for storing equipment.                
                     {The school}is not
 only used for educational purposes,   
 nearly every Tuesday evening a youth  
 club is held in{school}for{Bradley    
 teenagers.     {by Lucy Eade          </content>
