		<content>   The  woodlands  and  farmland  of   
 Clifton  Hampden  support  a  great   
 variety  of  wildlife. Many  different
 kinds of birds can be  seen  including
 nightingales, treecreepers, nuthatches
 and the greater spotted woodpecker.   
 There are  also woodcock, pheasant and
 partridge  as some  of the woodland is
 still managed for shooting.           
                                       
   When the Nuneham Estate was owned by
 the  Harcourt  family it was very much
 kept for sporting activities. Herds of
 both  monkjack  and fallow  deer are a
 reminder of those times.              
                                       
   To the north of Clifton Heath  there
 are disused brick pits which provide a
 wet  marshy  habitat for newts, frogs,
 moorhens and other marsh dwellers.
