		<content>{Public transport}does not meet the    
 needs of those residents who do not   
 own cars. Too few drivers use the     
 car-park and so streets become        
 congested and the original peace of   
 the village is destroyed.Residents are
 also concerned about the sapling      
 outside Baldersons' Cafe. This was    
 planted to replace the original,      
 diseased tree, but now over-hangs the 
 road.                                 
{Tourism.}Residents feel the Thatch    
 Cottage should be open to the         
 public.Others think there are too many
 souvenir shops in the area.           
{Shops.}The opening of a new           
 supermarket has already led to the    
 closure of one of the two             
 supermarkets.
