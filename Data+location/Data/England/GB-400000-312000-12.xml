		<title>12MY TOWN: HEDNESFORD</title>
		<content>  I am thirteen and I have lived in    
Hednesford all my life. At first I     
lived in Sharon Way on a fairly new    
estate.Now I live in Green Heath Road. 
Hednesford is a small town and people  
go further afield to work.             
  In the town centre there are 3       
chemists, 2 supermarkets, several      
greengrocers and shoe shops.There is an
open market,several public houses,clubs
and a wine bar called "Raffles".       
  The only places for teenagers in     
Hednesford are the park and the police 
disco held at the Aquarius, the        
community hall. In the summer holidays 
teenagers have nowhere to go and so    
they "hang around".                    
  I would not expect passers by to stop
at Hednesford. It is nothing special   
but quite adequate for the people who  
live here.
