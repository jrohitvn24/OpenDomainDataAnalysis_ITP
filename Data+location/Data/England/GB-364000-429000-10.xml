		<title>10Something to see</title>
		<content>  A local point of interest is{"the    
{tank"}, named after its original      
 function to supply a "head" of        
 water for the local water supply.It   
 has attracted many people             
 over the years, from dog walkers to   
 gangs of adolescents. It can be       
 approached very easily from Revidge   
 Road, with more effort uphill from    
 halfway up Lammack Road or with effort
 and a possible element of danger,     
 skirting the edge of Blackburn Golf   
 Club and up and over tussocks of      
 grass. Once there any effort is       
 forgotten at the panorama spread      
 below. In the centre of the concrete  
 platform, is an observation table.    
 Pray for dry weather, and with the    
 engraved lines as a guide you may see 
 Blackpool Tower or Ingleborough in the
 Yorkshire Dales. This is an altogether
 worthwhile afternoon outing!          </content>
