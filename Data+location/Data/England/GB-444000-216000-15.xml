		<title>15PARK FARM BLENHEIM WOODSTOCK</title>
		<content>  Blenheim estate owns 11,500 acres of 
land, Park Farm farms 3,800 acres of   
this including 800 acres of amenity    
woodland and 1,000 acres of commercial 
woodland. The part of their farm which 
is in our area is mainly used for      
sheep, this land goes to make up their 
1,700 acres of grassland. They also    
grow barley and rape. They employ 5    
herdsmen and 1 relief herdsman,        
1 shepherd, 1 stockwoman and 8 tractor 
drivers. They own 8 tractors, 2        
loaders, 4 muck spreaders and 5        
combines. They have 600 fresian cows,  
and 1.100 ewes who produce 2,000 lambs 
a year. They try to avoid using too    
many chemicals because of the expense  
but they have to use fungicides because
their use of nitrogen makes the plants 
more prone to disease. The rape has to 
be sprayed once with an insecticide.   
The tourits are not a problem to them. </content>
