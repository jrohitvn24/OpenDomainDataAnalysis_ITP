 This mill is in Ickornshaw,a small    
 hamlet off the main road. They use    
 aluminium to make garden              
 furniture.Some of the aluminium is    
 from scrap and some is bought as new. 
 It comes from Jamaica and America.It  
 is melted in a furnace which is at 700
 degrees.It is then ladled out into    
 moulds made of sand,then allowed to   
 cool.The workers have to wear goggles 
 to protect their eyes from the heat   
 and the sparks.The furniture is       
 painted using static electricity,which
 works like a magnet spray.The colours 
 are mainly white and black.The chairs 
 and tables are then placed in an oven 
 so that the paint sets hard,it takes  
 about 20 minutes.The mill used to be a
 cotton mill.The pattern for the       
 wrought furniture comes from          
 Ironbridge.                           </content>
