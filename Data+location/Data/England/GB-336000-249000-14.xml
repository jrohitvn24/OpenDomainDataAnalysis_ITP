 now falling down.                     
{Garden:Front}                         
    We have two gardens one on either  
 side of the house.We call the smaller 
 one the front garden.In the front we  
 have now a "Weeping Willow"but before 
 there was just a shed.                
{Garden:Back}                          
    This is about half an acre.In it we
 have two main garden patches,one we   
 use for strawberries which we sell    
 every yearand also a vegetable        
 patch,where we grow,runner            
 beans,sprouts,cabbages etc.My father  
 built a chicken pen which was built on
 the side of a brick shed.We later     
 found this was the origenal toilet.The
 toilet consisting of a brick frame    
 with a small hole in it.The shed has a
 slate roof.We have 3 apple trees the  
 rest is grass.                        </content>
