		<content>   The unique character of this area is
 derived from it's outstanding natural 
 beauty and the wealth of buildings of 
 architectural interest interacting.   
   The hills are of solid chalk, often 
 containing intriging marine fossils.  
 In one or two places the chalk gives  
 way to patches of reddish brown soil, 
 with flints of up to 30cm dia. making 
 ploughing difficult. The flat tops of 
 the hills are used for arable farming,
 but sheep and grazing occupy the      
 majority of the land. In the past     
 there were large estates with         
 parkland. The evidence of this is the 
 many mature Oak and Beech trees that  
 the cows now graze under.             
   The River Nailbourne rises in       
 Lyminge and flows through the valley. 
 There is still evidence of the Elham  
 valley railway, which ran closely     
 parallel to the stream.               </content>
