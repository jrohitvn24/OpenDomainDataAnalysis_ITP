		<content>{Toffee Apple}- is a game for five     
 people What you have to do is to say a
 rhyme and you have to say 'Toffee     
 Apples' in it. e.g. I went to the shop
 to get some sweets and when I saw some
 lovely red apples I bought them. I    
 took them home with some toffee and   
 made some 'Toffee Apples'. Then you   
 have to run away before you get       
 touched. This can also be called      
 'Poison'.                             
{45 Bonker}- is a game for any number  
 of players. The more the better.      
 What you do is one person is          
 ON and the rest have to run off and   
 hide. Then the one who is ON has to   
 count to 45 and when they get to 45   
 they say 'Ready' and  have to try and 
 get them out before they get home. If 
 you see someone you say 45 Bonker out.
 The first one caught is ON next.
