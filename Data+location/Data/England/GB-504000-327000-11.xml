		<title>11VILLAGE LIFE, K.UNDERWOOD</title>
		<content> The most notable village event in     
 Kirkby Underwood is the Annual Garden 
 Fete and Clay Shoot in June, arranged 
 by the P.C.C.,to raise money to pay   
 the church quota. There are many      
 stalls and competitions on which to   
 spend freely, including the coconut   
 shy, bowling, beanbag throwing and    
 rifle range. Â£935 was raised in 1985. 
                                       
 The present Village Hall is housed in 
 the former primary school, closed in  
 1971 and bought by the village in     
 1973. The Hall is run by an annually  
 elected committee of villagers and    
 funded by generous donations and fund-
 raising events when necessary.        
                                       
 The two main users of the Hall are the
 Parish Council, which meets four times
 a year, and the Women's Institute     
 which meets Tuesday evenings monthly. </content>
