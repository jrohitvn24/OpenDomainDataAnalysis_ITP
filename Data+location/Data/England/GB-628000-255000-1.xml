		<title>01 LANDSCAPE of WICKHAM MARKET</title>
		<content>                                       
Wickham Market stands on a hill        
overlooking the Deben valley, on the   
old A12 London to Gt. Yarmouth road.   
Formally an important market town, it  
had until recently known a long period 
of decline. A new bypass has taken the 
heavy traffic out of the village       
centre. This, coupled with numereous   
housing developments has revitalized   
retail trade to the point where traffic
is again a problem in the centre. A    
modern health clinic and care home for 
the elderly lie near the old union     
workhouse. New buildings mingle in with
the old giving a varied pattern of     
archicture. The large village primary  
school, formaly an area school, marks  
the boundary the new estates and open  
farmland. Arable crops dominates the   
countryside and the motorcar is the    
most popular means of transportation.  </content>
