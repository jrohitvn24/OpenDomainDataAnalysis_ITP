		<content> Stanhoe's own school was closed in    
 1979 and the building sold as a       
 private house.  Since then the infant 
 and primary children have been taken  
 by mini-bus to Burnham Market.  At    
 present there are 12 children.        
 Although the Burnham school has a     
 playgroup on the premises it has not  
 proved possible to provide transport  
 from Stanhoe for the under 5's.  Some 
 parents with cars do, however, take   
 their children to it.  At 11 years all
 the pupils move to the Alderman Peel  
 High School at Wells where there are 9
 from Stanhoe this year.  At 16 they   
 can move to the Sixth Form Centre at  
 Fakenham.  For both of these a bus is 
 provided.  The Norfolk College for    
 Arts and Technology also attracts some
 teenagers but students have to arrange
 their own transport.
