		<content> First we went to Mill House to        
 interview Mrs Butter.  She said       
 "footpaths started by farmers taking  
 their grain to be ground at the       
 mills".  Then we interviewed a        
 young lady . She said footpaths are   
 useful because they are safer than    
 walking on the road. Another old lady 
 said footpaths are not useful because 
 it encouraged strangers to come to    
 the village and she didn't like       
 this.  Most of the footpaths are      
 closed and their are no identification
 boards to show where they begin or    
 the direction they take.  One of our  
 group was hit by old lady who insisted
 that the footpaths, clearly shown on  
 our map, did not exist.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
