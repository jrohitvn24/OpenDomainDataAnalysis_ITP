		<content> Many people crowded to Woodford to see
 the annual Woodford Air Show.This year
 was the special 60th anniversary show 
 organised by the Royal Air Force      
 Association for their                 
 charity.Approximately 75,000 plane    
 spotters and flying enthusiasts were  
 there with their picnic baskets to    
 watch the display.                    
  The show was opened by Flight        
 Lieutenant John Watts of the R.A.F in 
 a Catalina Flying Boat.This was being 
 shown at Woodford for the first time. 
  Vulcan bombers made a welcome return 
 to the show in a display with a       
 Lancaster bomber.There was also the   
 Battle of Britain Memorial flight,the 
 Navy's Sea Fury and Sea Hawk and as
