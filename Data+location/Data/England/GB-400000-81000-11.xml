		<title>11STUDLAND NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content> Studland National Nature Reserve      
 consists of an area of{heathland,     
{woodland,marsh,sand dunes and beach } 
 to the North of Studland village.The  
 Reserve,1560 acres,was set up in 1947 
 to protect the environment.           
  Four hundred years ago the first     
 seamen's charts showed that the       
 sandunes were shifting eastwards.     
{Little Sea}(A fresh water lake) was   
 formed in this way,but other smaller  
 ponds were created by bombs exploding 
 in the war.                           
   A full time warden,with help from 2 
 estate workers,looks after the reserve
 which is open to the public.{Nature   
{trails}are marked out,a{Bird Hide}is  
 positioned by a lake and booklets on  
 local wildlife are available.School   
 parties can be catered for.
