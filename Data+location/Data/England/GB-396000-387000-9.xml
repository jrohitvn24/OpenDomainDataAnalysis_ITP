		<content>  Three generations ago 37.5% men and  
 67% working wives worked less than 1  
 mile from home. 38% men and 25%       
 working wives travelled between 1 and 
 5 miles and only 4% men travelled over
 10 miles from home.                   
  One generation later the largest     
 proportion of men and working wives   
 travelled between 5 and 10 miles. A   
 small group travelled over 30 miles.  
  Now most fathers travel between 10   
 and 30 miles and 75% go by car. 51.5% 
 of working mothers travel between 1   
 and 10 miles, but a large group live  
 less than 1 mile from work.           
  People like to live in the area and  
 don't mind how far they have to travel
 to work.
