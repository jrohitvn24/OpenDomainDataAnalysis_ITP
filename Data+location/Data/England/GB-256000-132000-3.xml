		<title>03THE TRIP TO LEFFMANS FACTORY</title>
		<content>   The first Leffmans factory was      
 founded 50 years ago.The factory that 
 we went to in Whiddon Valley was      
 founded in 1981.They make             
 underwear.They pack 100 boxes a       
 day.The manager's name is Mr. Stone,he
 has been there for 2 months.          
   Work starts at 8:15am and ends at   
 4:50pm with \ an hour for lunch.They  
 mostly use cotton and nylon.They      
 supply Marks and Spencers,Debenhams,  
 Dorothy Perkins and Gossards.In the   
 factory they have 160 to 180 machines.
 They employ 125 people.Only 5 are     
 men.They all have 30 days holiday a   
 year.In the factory it was very       
 noisy,and the machines were very      
 dusty.The canteen was good and overall
 the factory was clean.
