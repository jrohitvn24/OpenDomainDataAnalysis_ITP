		<content>   The Domesday block is a very        
 isolated area with only scattered     
 farmhouses and edges of settlements of
 Braithwaite,Laycock and Sutton.There  
 are no bus routes.The nearest shopping
 town is Keighley with chain stores,   
 banks and supermarkets.Each of the    
 villages does have its own limited    
 shopping facilities with grocery      
 stores and post offices.Bradford is   
 the nearest city and can be reached by
 train or bus from Keighley.           
   For the children living close to    
 Sutton or Steeton each of these       
 villages has its own primary school   
 and at the age of 11 they progress to 
 South Craven School,Cross Hills.      
 Braithwaite also has its own primary  
 school and pupils progress to         
 Highfield Middle School and Greenhead 
 Grammar School in Keighley.
