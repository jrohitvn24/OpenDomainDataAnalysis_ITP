		<title>09Walmore Common</title>
		<content> The primary school and houses on      
 Walmore Hill have views to East       
 and West from their ridge:across to   
 the West we see a line of hills at the
 edge of the Forest of Dean and,in     
 between lies the large, saucer-shaped 
 low-lying area called Walmore Common  
 which gets flooded frequently in the  
 winter and spring months.Cattle and   
 some horses graze it during the summer
 and autumn and it supports a variety  
 of wild plants,birds and              
 insects.Herons fish for eels in its   
 ditches.The commonest trees in its    
 surrounding hedges are Willow and     
 Hawthorn.Damselflies frequent the     
 reeds in the minor dyke but the major 
 dyke is kept fairly clear.Part of this
 flat land within its encircling hills 
 has been drained and is farmed,for hay
 mostly;the rest is rough pasture.
