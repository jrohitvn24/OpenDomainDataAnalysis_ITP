		<title>01EVERSHOLT</title>
		<content> This very scattered village is located
 to the east of Woburn Park. It is     
 unusual in that each part of the      
 village is an 'end'. According to the 
 guide to the local area produced by   
 the Mid Bedfordshire District Council,
 it has numerous ends and not much of a
 middle. This sums it up rather well.  
                                       
 The village has about 450 inhabitants 
 spread between the various ends which 
 probably came about when squatters    
 formed small isolated settlements a   
 few hundred years ago. The name       
 Eversholt is of Danish origin and     
 means 'home of the boar'.             
                                       
 The church is mainly 14th and 15th    
 century with a few remains back to    
 Norman times. There are Edwardian     
 murals and glass.
