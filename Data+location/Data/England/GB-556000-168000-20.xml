		<title>20AN 11 YEAR OLD'S LIFE</title>
		<content>    I am an 11 year old boy and was    
 born in West Hill Hospital in Dartford
 and have lived all my life in Paddock 
 Close, South Darenth. There are 4 in  
 our family, and my dog Taffy. Tracy,  
 my sister is 18 years old. My Nan     
 lives opposite in a flat; she moved   
 there in November 1983.               
  Dad leaves early to go to work, he is
 a bookseller and visits many places.  
 Mum takes me to school, Tracy to      
 college and then goes to work. On     
 Saturday Tracy works in Dartford Coop,
 and on Sunday works at the old peoples
 homes in the village.                 
   I am going to Wilmington Secondary  
 School in September.
