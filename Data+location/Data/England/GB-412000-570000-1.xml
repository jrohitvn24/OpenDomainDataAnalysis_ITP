		<content>        Just over half of our block is 
 farmland,owned by 5 different farmers.
 A public footpath crosses the fields  
 between{Darras Hall and Medburn.     }
          The dominant residential area
 is the executive housing on the{Darras
{Hall Estate.}Our 2 schools, which draw
 from this catchment area,are in this  
 block.{Medburn}is a small,rural hamlet
 comprising only 30 dwellings.         
        A comprehensive shopping parade
 of 14 units is opposite the schools.  
 Nearby is a modern{Presbyterian church
 and an old wooden Railway Station     
 Building.Two market gardens are still 
 in business,many others having been   
 sold to developers for residential    
 properties.{Public open spaces}include
{Ponteland Park,Old Railway Line path  
{and the Recreation Field,}known as    
 "The  Flush".
