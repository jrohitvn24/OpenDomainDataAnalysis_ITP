		<title>11Collingbourne Area Ghosts</title>
		<content> Collingbourne Kingston boasts the     
 legend of a black dog with fiery eyes 
 that lives in Collingbourne Woods and 
 punishes wrong do-ers. It's first     
 victims were two robbers who killed an
 old couple on the Bath Highway and    
 chased by the neighbours tried to take
 refuge in the wood.                   
 People in Everleigh tell of a man who 
 once a year is seen in Everleigh Woods
 measuring the Sarson Stones. Because  
 of this he is known locally as the    
 "Man who Measures".                   
 Also at the Crown at Everleigh doors  
 open in front of you as if by unseen  
 hands and you are led to a room with  
 no other exit and there is never      
 anyone there. This is supposed to be  
 where a woman had been murdered.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
