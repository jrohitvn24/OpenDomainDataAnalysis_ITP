   This interesting old house is       
 situated in Gotham's village square.  
 It was built in 1210 and stands in    
 four acres of ground. Beside the Manor
 are the stables which have been       
 converted into a deep-freeze room.    
 There remains a lead pump, dated 1857,
 which can be seen behind the house.   
   The loft is murky and beside the    
 door frame is a plaster wall,inscribed
 with numerous builders' names. The oak
 roof timbers originated from old      
 sailing ships.                        
   There is a tunnel,leading to the    
 church, which was used as an escape   
 route by the  priest.                 
   The Sheppard family have lived at   
 the Manor since 1918,and have made    
 various alterations during that time.
