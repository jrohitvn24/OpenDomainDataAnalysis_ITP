		<title>13Weekley Church, Kettering.</title>
		<content>  The church of St.Mary the Virgin is  
in a walled churchyard next to Boughton
Park and serves both House and village.
  It overlooks a village green on which
there is a memorial "To keep in mind   
the Great War and those from this place
who gave their lives."                 
  Oddly the south porch of the church  
is Norman, the tower and spire are     
Decorated yet the nave, arcade and body
are Perpendicular.                     
  There are monuments to the Tudor     
Montagus.  Of note are those of two Sir
Edwards: one is in alabaster with a    
Latin epitaph; the later one graces a  
six-poster tomb with his wife.         
  Many visitors come to ring the six   
bells the heaviest of which is the     
tenor which weighs 8 cwt.              
  Regular services are conducted by the
incumbent who serves Geddington and    
Weekley.                               </content>
