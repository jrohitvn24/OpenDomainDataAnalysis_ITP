		<content> Although the village is situated on a 
 very busy road linking the east coast 
 ports with the M1 and Birmingham      
 complex, it has a very limited bus    
 service linking Rugby (14 miles) and  
 Market Harborough (4 miles). Apart    
 from buses taking mainly school       
 children morning and afternoon, there 
 are very few buses in each direction  
 daily; the last one returning from    
 Market Harborough at 5.10 p.m. About  
 30 people say they use the bus        
 regularly, which might be daily for   
 work or weekly for shopping. It       
 therefore isn't surprising that there 
 are about 100 cars and vans in the    
 village plus about 50 bicycles, 11    
 motor bikes, a tandem, a tricycle and 
 a moped. About 50 out of the 80 houses
 have a garage and 9 cars regularly    
 park overnight on the Village Hall car
 park.                                 </content>
