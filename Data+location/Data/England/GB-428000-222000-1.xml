		<title>01CHURCHILL SUMMARISED</title>
		<content>  Churchill is a Cotswold village of   
 some 400 residents. It is dominated   
 by a large church built on the hill,  
 and is constructed mainly of stone.   
 It is overwhelmingly a residential    
 village, commercial activities being  
 peripheral, with the exception of     
 farming.   It is not large enough to  
 support a school, and its proximity to
 the market town of Chipping Norton    
 means that a village shop is not      
 viable.   However within five miles it
 can boast of good local facilities ,  
 trains, buses, supermarkets, doctors, 
 vets, even a small theatre/cinema.    
  This is a sought-after village for   
 those who can afford the rather high  
 property prices and have their own    
 transport, but those without find the 
 local bus service limited.  There is  
 some council housing, intended for    
 young families and the elderly.       </content>
