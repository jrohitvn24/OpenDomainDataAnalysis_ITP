   The Policeman for this area is      
stationed in the village of Roxwell.   
Much of his work involves visiting the 
areas of Roxwell, Mashbury and Good    
Easter by car. There is little crime in
the area due to its small population.He
acts more as a public relations officer
than an actual crime prevention.The    
majority of his work is concerned with 
the needs of the elderly and solving   
domestic quarreling.The only crime     
reported in the first six months of    
1985 was the theft of a small amount   
of money.
