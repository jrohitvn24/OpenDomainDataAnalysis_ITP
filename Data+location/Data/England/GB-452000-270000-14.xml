  The Barby Players are alocal amatuer 
 dramatics society.  They perform in   
 the village hall.  Their productions  
 are put on for four days, the         
 Wednesday usually being a charity     
 night. This is an evening suit        
 occasion. The players perform two or  
 three plays a year.  They have got a  
 very good name and people come from   
 then whole area to watch them.        
{                                      
{The Kilsby Show}                      
  This is a show put on once a year by 
 the tennis club. Again it runs for    
 four nights with one night as a       
 charity night. The script is written  
 by local people and can take the form 
 of a pantomime or a continuous play.  
 This is far more of a fun event than  
 the Barby plays but still involves a  
 lot of practice and scenery  making.  </content>
