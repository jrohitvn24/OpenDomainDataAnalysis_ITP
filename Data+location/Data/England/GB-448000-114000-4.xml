		<title>04A COUNTRY ROAD</title>
		<content> At the side of the road is a grass    
 verge 2 metres wide which is          
 regularly cut by the Council to       
 improve motorists vision.             
 Grasses,clover,dandelions and         
 many other wild plants grow on it.By  
 the side of it is a ditch 0.5 metres  
 wide for drainage.The road is wide    
 enough for two vehicles to pass,one in
 each direction.In a survey we found   
 that cars were the vehicles that used 
 the road most,but there were also some
 lorries going to a local Depot.The    
 colour of road signs is white with    
 black writing and a red surrounding.To
 separate  vehicles going different    
 ways there are white lines,5 metre    
 lines with a 2 metre gap apart down   
 the middle of the road.The road       
 surface is made of small stones,stuck 
 together with tar which is known as   
 Tarmacadam.                           </content>
