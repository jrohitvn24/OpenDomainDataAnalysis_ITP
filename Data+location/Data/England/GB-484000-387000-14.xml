  Robert's teacher is called Mrs.      
 Marcroft. His favourite subjects are  
 writing stories and reading books. He 
 likes sport and plays in defence in   
 the school football team. His         
 favourite team is Manchester United.  
  School finishes at half past three   
 and he gets home at four o'clock. The 
 first thing he does when he gets home 
 is to throw off his shoes, get changed
 and go into the living-room with a    
 drink to watch children's television. 
 After watching television he goes to  
 feed his many pets. These are a goat, 
 three rabbits, two dogs, nine fishes  
 and a cat. Most evenings he makes Lego
 models and plastic aeroplanes. He also
 collects badges and plays with his    
 train set. On Thursday evening he goes
 to the 3rd. Gainsborough Cubs Pack at 
 White's Wood Lane.     {See next page.</content>
