		<content> In Woodleigh there was once a tailor, 
 a thatcher, a cobbler, a baker, a     
 grocer, a miller, a mason, a rector,  
 a postmaster, a letter carrier and a  
 school teacher. These crafts and      
 trades are now no longer part of the  
 village.                              
 There was once a shop, an inn, a      
 school and a church. Now there is just
 the church, with the vicar dividing   
 his time between three other          
 neighbouring churches.                
 The old school is now used as a parish
 hall and the post office is just a    
 quiet thatched cottage.               
 Apart from the daily school bus there 
 are no services, just a public        
 telephone box and a letter box.       
 Several new detatched houses were     
 built a few years ago, but Woodleigh  
 is probably quieter now than it was a 
 century ago.                          </content>
