		<title>20GRIM'S DYKE GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content> The club is named after a ditch (or   
 dyke) believed to start in            
 Cambridgeshire.It was opened in 1910  
 by SIR WILLIAM GILBERT,their first    
 president.At that time there were 9   
 holes,there are 18 now.80 acres are   
 grass and 3 are trees.The club's 600  
 members pay a membership fee of       
 Â£276+VATfor men and Â£210+VATfor women 
 (double first year).The grounds almost
 meet those of Hartsbourne Golf Club.  
 Their main trophy is a priceless medal
 presented by SIR WILLIAM GILBERT.It   
 resides almost permanently in the     
 safe.Juniors are encouraged to take a 
 group lesson on Saturday afternoons.  
 The Club has a "MEN ONLY" bar which   
 shows how few women play golf! They   
 are trying to encourage more lady     
 members to join.
