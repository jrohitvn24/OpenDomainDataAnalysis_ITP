		<content> The Rest Home for Horses in Whitchurch
 provides a quiet,peaceful home for 120
 donkeys,ponies and horses during their
 retirement.Animals come from different
 backgrounds and for different reasons.
 Three old pit ponies who had worked   
 in the South Wales Collieries are     
 enjoying a well earned retirement.    
 Bloom,used to draw the Lord Mayor of  
 Bristol's carriage,whereas Mike pulled
 a gypsy caravan.A piebald,named Tiny, 
 found a home at Whitchurch after a    
 spinal injury.Three donkeys from      
 Weymouth sands,Beau,Noggin and Pepper 
 aged 20- 24 years now live in         
 Whitchurch.The Rest Home for Horse is 
 open to the general public on Sunday  
 mornings.Income obtained from fund    
 raising events,such as the Summer Fete
 and the Christmas carol concert held  
 in the stables,contribute to the      
 success of this venture.              </content>
