		<title>16HORBURY PEOPLE'S HOLIDAYS</title>
		<content> Many people from Horbury go to Spain  
 for their annual holidays because it's
 cheap and they want to get away from  
 typical English weather!              
 The first foreign holiday I went on   
 was to Arenal,on the Spanish island of
 Majorca.We caught an aircraft operated
 by the Dan-Air company from Manchester
 Airport.On the plane we were served   
 with a cooked breakfast of            
 bacon,eggs,baked beans and tomatoes.  
    On Majorca we stayed at the Hotel  
 Salama,which was quite big and had a  
 swimming pool.While we were there we  
 went to a barbeque where there was    
 Spanish Flamenco dancing and          
 traditional guitar music.We ate       
 roasted chicken with tossed salad and 
 had a choice of wine or fresh fruit   
 juice.We hired a car but had to cancel
 a trip to the north of the island     
 because it's brakes were not good.    </content>
