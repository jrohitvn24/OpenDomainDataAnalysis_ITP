		<content>The favourite game in our school is tig
of which there are many forms. Some of 
these are circle, chain and bulldogs.  
In circle you can stand in one of the  
painted circles on the yard for a count
of ten without being tug. When you have
been caught three times you are on.In  
chain tig you join hands until there   
are four of you and then split into    
two. In bulldogs you try to run across 
the yard and if tug you join the ones  
who are on. Skipping and jumping in and
out of a loop of elastic to songs are  
popular with the girls. We like snakes 
and ladders, chess, cluedo, draughts,  
battle-ships, snap and card games.     
Rounders is the most popular team      
game. Releasio is a form of hide and   
seek but when seen you race to the     
post to free  ones who have been       
caught.
