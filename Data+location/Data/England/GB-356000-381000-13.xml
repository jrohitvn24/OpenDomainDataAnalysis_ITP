		<title>13A comparison of two farms</title>
		<content> The dairy farm at Commonside has 5    
 local labourers, one the farmer's son.
 The average day is on of 12 hours     
 starting with the milking at 6.30am.  
 this takes until 8.30 then the        
 rest of the time is spent on the      
 arable crops. Rape seed covers 68     
 acres, 225 acres are wheat, 33 spring 
 barley ,112 of winter barley and the  
 rest grass. In the harvest season they
 can work anything up to a 20 hour day.
 The combine harvester cost Â£38,000 and
 also has tractors with various tools  
 for different jobs. They do their own 
 mechanical repairs and need to get 10 
 years out of them because of cost. The
 animals are bought/sold at Beeston    
 Market with calves being sold at 3    
 weeks. Evening milking starts at about
 4.00pm for a similar time as the      
 morning session.
