 EITHER BACK TO THE MEMBERS OR TOWARDS 
 RENOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF         
 PREMISES.BECAUSE OF THIS THE CLUBS ARE
 GENERALLY CHEAPER THAN THE PUBLIC     
 HOUSES.EACH CLUB IS MANAGED BY A      
 COMMITTEE ELECTED BY THE MEMBERS,FROM 
 THE MEMBERSHIP.IT IS THE COMMITTEE'S  
 RESPONSIBILITY TO ORGANISE FINANCE,   
 EMPLOY STAFF AND SUPERVISE

 CONCERT HALL AND STAGE AND SO PROVIDE 
 SUCH ACTS AS SHOWGROUPS,SINGERS OR    
 DISCOS.CLUBS HAVE TEAMS FOR DARTS,    
 DOMINOES,POOL AND SNOOKER.THE TEAMS
