		<title>18    The Changing Village</title>
		<content>  In the 70's and 80's there has been a
change in the life style of the village
and both Great Haseley and Milton      
Common have been affected.             
  The building of the M40 brought about
significant changes and introduced a   
new commuter type of villager attracted
by the pleasant cottages and quiet     
environment of Great Haseley.Many of   
the farmworkers cottages were sold off 
as the farms became less labour        
intensive with the introduction of     
large farm machinery.At the same time  
many local authority houses were sold  
to tenants and the average age of the  
village became significantly higher.In 
particular the child population shrank 
and the school numbers dropped from    
over 100 to 40.
