		<title>11A DUNSCROFT FAMILY DAY OUT</title>
		<content>   We set off at half past seven in the
 car and arrived in Scarborough at half
 past nine.                            
   We were caught in a traffic jam for 
 ten minutes.We eventually parked on   
 the sea front.                        
   Mum and I went shopping whilst my   
 Dad and brother went fishing with the 
 dog.We met up at one o'clock for our  
 dinner.We ate ham sandwiches and      
 coffee.Afterwards we climbed up to the
 castle,had a look around,climbed down 
 again.It started to rain so we ran    
 into the amusement arcades.           
   Whilst it rained _(typical)_we      
 played on the(Space Invaders game.)   
   Later we drove home.At home we      
 watched a film called(ALLIGATOR_not   
 very frightening_)after which we went 
 to bed!
