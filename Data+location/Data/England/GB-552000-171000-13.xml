		<title>13LIVING IN DARTFORD</title>
		<content>These are childrens views of Dartford. 
  The pleasures of Dartford are that it
has a big swimming pool, quite a lot of
parks and a very big library. There is 
also a Saturday market. The main       
problem of Dartford is the traffic that
is very dangerous. Dartford is very    
untidy and there are too many pubs     
around. Shops are closing down and     
others opening all the time. There are 
many shops in Dartford such as         
Sainsburys, Bejams, Co-op to name but a
few. There are also quite a few shoe   
shops like Manfield, Curtess and       
True-Forms. The quality of the shops is
quite good, but the town could be      
improved by having a few more fashion  
shops. The indoor centre is very good  
and at Christmas they have lots of     
decorations. They have a few seats     
where people can meet. There is an     
outdoor market on Thursday &amp; Saturday. </content>
