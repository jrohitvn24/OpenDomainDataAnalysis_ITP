		<title>02FARM BUILDINGS IN HAUGHTON</title>
		<content> -----------------------------         
 There are nine tenanted farms in      
 Haughton district under one ownership.
 Rent reviews are held every three     
 years and under present rules the     
 tenancy may be passed on to the son.  
 Two other farms belong to two         
 different owners, one a business man  
 the other is part of a large estate.  
 Some so-called farms are now private  
 houses with an acre or two for a      
 horse, the owners being business      
 people. Land from some of these farms 
 has been put to adjoining farms.      
 Cottages once attached to farms are on
 the whole no longer tied. There is a  
 group of six council houses.          
 The two largest houses known as Halls 
 are set in extensive grounds, two     
 other Halls are farmhouses.
