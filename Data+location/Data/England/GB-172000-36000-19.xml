		<title>19Stithians -  Developments.</title>
		<content> Water is important to Stithians. Now  
 we have the reservoir just outside the
 village and the water used to be used 
 for powering mills and other machinery
 in Kennall Vale. People came to live  
 here because they worked on the farms,
 in the mills or the nearby mines.     
 Nowadays the mills are all closed     
 along with the quarries although some 
 people still travel to work in the    
 mines that are left open. Few people  
 work on the farms because of          
 mechanisation.                        
 Now people come to Stithians for peace
 and quiet and ease of travel to a     
 number of nearby towns. Building of   
 new houses is going on all the time   
 and we think that the population will 
 grow and that the school will get     
 bigger too. Most of us think that we  
 will move away eventually because     
 there is not enough to do here.       </content>
