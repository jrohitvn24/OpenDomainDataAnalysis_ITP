		<title>19CHILDRENS ATTITUDES,S.LEEDS</title>
		<content>  We asked a number of thirteen year   
 olds about their attitudes to living  
 in the Hunslet area.                  
  Many of them said they found living  
 in Hunslet very dull, as there are    
 very few leisure activities in the    
 area apart from the Athletic centre at
 Jack Lane.Other than that they have to
 go to South Leeds Sports Centre for   
 weight training,swimming,judo or      
 badminton or into the City Centre for 
 cinimas or large shops.               
  Two of the people we spoke to have   
 been in trouble with the police.They  
 found life so boring that they had    
 committed minor acts of vandalism.    
  Some children had plans for the      
 future.3 would like to enter the armed
 services,and 4 want to go on to       
 further education.Most feel very      
 depressed about the future and feel   
 most of them will be unemployed.      </content>
