		<title>12UNEMPLOYMENT IN SHEFFIELD</title>
		<content>                                       
 Many middle aged people have lost     
 their jobs and cannot get others.A    
 large majority of school leavers will 
 find no employment,and have to face   
 problems of lack of finance,boredom   
 and frustration.Nor are things likely 
 to improve in the near future.        
  The Local Council in Sheffield allow 
 the unemployed free use of all its    
 facilities.                           
  And finally,one small success story  
 for our area.The Manpower Services    
 Commission administrates Job Centres, 
 Youth Training Schemes and and Skill  
 Centres,has moved its national        
 Headquarters here from London,because 
 the ground rent is much cheaper.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
