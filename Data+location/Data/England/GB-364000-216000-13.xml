		<title>13FIELD STUDIES AT MITCHELDEAN</title>
		<content>   The Wilderness Field Study Centre   
 stands near the edge of a hilltop, 850
 feet above sea level at the north     
 eastern edge of the Forest of Dean.   
 There is a magnificent view eastwards 
 over the hill ridges around           
 Mitcheldean and May Hill, and beyond  
 to the Malvern Hills, Severn Plain,   
 and distant Cotswolds. There is great 
 variety in the local rocks, and the   
 whole area around Mitcheldean is a    
 classic one for demonstrating the     
 relationship between geology and      
 vegetation, flora, land use, and human
 activities both past and present.     
   The house, which was built in 1824  
 became a Field Study Centre in l968.  
 There is a Director of Studies, with  
 an assistant, and up to 52 resident   
 students can be accommodated, together
 with up to 6 staff. There are also    
 facilities for day visits.            </content>
