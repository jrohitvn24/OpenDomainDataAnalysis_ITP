		<title>02NO PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS...</title>
		<content> There are no public swimming pools but
 there is Lancing college pool which is
 open to some people.                  
  Further along the A27 is Shoreham    
 airport and across the A27 is Lancing 
 College.                              
  Shoreham airport is on the Shoreham  
 and Lancing border and mainly takes   
 light aircraft and has an all weather 
 runway.                               
  Last year the Good Year airship was t
 the airport.                          
  Lancing College is an extremly good  
 educational establishment and so is   
 Boundstone Community College,which is 
 one of the secondary schools in the   
 country.                              
 Lancing has adequate shopping         
 facilites but they are rather boring  
 for young people.It was reported that 
 Lancing is the biggest village in     
 England but I don't know if it is.    </content>
