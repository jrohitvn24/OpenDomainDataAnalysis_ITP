		<content> Housing in Skelton is varied with     
 every century from the 17th onwards   
 having some representation in age if  
 not in distinctive style. Houses,     
 bungalows, farmhouses of brick, stone 
 and the modern block built with       
 plaster/shale covering indicate the   
 variety to be seen.                   
 There are 10 Council Houses in        
 Skelton, 6 old peoples' bungalows and 
 a small modern development of 18      
 private bungalows in Phoenix Park.    
 Most houses have reasonably sized     
 gardens which are generally quite     
 productive and are kept in good order.
 There is no new development taking    
 place at present a stable situation   
 being reached following the Phoenix   
 Park development of the late 1970's.
