		<content>Traditional dairy industry on Stanford 
meadowlands declined due to changing   
agricultural policies of E.E.C.. Milk  
quotas were introduced, resulting in   
increased beef farming with a majority 
of dairy farms turning to beef, sheep  
and arable.                            
British Friesian are the most popular  
breed for milk and beef. The average   
herd size is 130, attended by one man. 
Tankers collect milk, which is taken to
Didcot for redistribution. From twelve 
farms surveyed, two still keep dairy   
cows. Calves are usually allocated 50% 
dairy, 50% beef, leaving a declining   
number of followers (heifers to take   
over from older cows).                 
BEEF FARMING.Grassland predominates.   
Trational breeds are crossed with      
European= bigger, leaner, faster       
growing animals= bigger profits. Some  
farms grow and mix their concentrates. </content>
