		<title>19A DAY IN NANCY'S LIFE</title>
		<content>{Every school day}I get up at ten to   
 eight, dress, wash and go downstairs  
 to have breakfast with my Mum and Dad.
 Next I help let out our hens and ducks
 and feed them.Then I brush my teeth   
 and go to school with my Mum.In the   
 winter we go in the car and in the    
 summer we walk.{School starts at      
{9.00am}but some of us get there       
 early.During the day{we work in the   
{classroom at different things}and have
 several playtimes.Between 12 noon and 
 1.00pm it is dinnertime.On Wednesdays 
 all the juniors go swimming.{At 3.00pm
{we go home.}When I get home,I wash,put
 on old clothes and go and play until  
 the children's programmes start on    
 television.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
