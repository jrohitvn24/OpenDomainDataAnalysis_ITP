		<title>04Living  in Sydling.</title>
		<content> Life for the population of Sydling    
 revolves around their familiess and   
 their homes.  The young mothers  tend 
 to stay at home with their babies     
 until the children  reach school age. 
 They help run playschool and a few    
 work at home or have a part time job  
 in the village. Nearly half the       
 village population are over 50 and    
 almost a quarter are over 65. A high  
 proportion off the villagers have     
 lived here less than eight years and  
 the majority have lived here less than
 15 years. There are 18 people whose   
 parentage is entirely Sydling  stock  
 and 4 whose fathers were born in the  
 village (1890-1900).                  
 Sydling is inhabited mostly by country
 folk but the newcomers tend to come   
 from cities or large townss. It is a  
 friendly and welcoming village and    
 mostpeople join in all social events. </content>
