		<title>20LITTLEPORT VILLAGE COLLEGE</title>
		<content> 1986 sees the{closure}of the village  
 11-16 school and the transfer of all  
 its pupils to the new college at Ely. 
 They will travel the 5 miles daily by 
 bus. The present buildings will be    
 used by the primary school. Reducing  
 numbers have seen the school reduced  
 to less than three form entry. Sixth  
 form students already travel to Ely.  
 The school was originally called the  
{Martin School}after a local family. It
 was opened in 1956 and became a       
 community school and comprehensive in 
 1972.                                 
 Pupils and teachers of the 1985 first 
 year contributed to the{BBC Domesday  
 Project in their Humanities lessons,  
 interviewing local people, counting   
 amenities, travelling by minibus to   
 complete the land-use survey and      
 typing in the information on the      
 school's computers.                   </content>
