		<title>07Brass bands in Queensbury</title>
		<content> The brass band tradition started with 
 the mill providing a brass band for   
 its workers rather than sports        
 facilities. A brass band consists of  
 brass instruments plus percussion.    
 Some instruments are silver plated to 
 protect the brass, which is a soft    
 metal.                                
 (Quennsbury has five brass bands, all 
 of national importance.) All take part
 in national contests, three have made 
 records and appeared on television and
 radio. Through the educational system 
 all children have the opportunity to  
 learn a brass instrument.             
 All the bands, which include (Jayess, 
 Queensbury Music Centre, Versatile    
 Brass) and the (Scout Band) are self  
 supporting financially and have their 
 own distinctive uniform.
