		<content> This block is well served with public 
 rights of way and they are mostly in  
 good condition, though farmers        
 sometimes seem reluctant to           
 reestablish footpaths after ploughing.
 It is possible to follow almost the   
 whole length of the Loose Valley along
 the stream and it makes a very        
 pleasant an untaxing walk. Crossing   
 this east-west route is the line of an
 old Roman road which ran from         
 Rochester through Maidstone and on to 
 Hastings; parts of it are still marked
 by footpaths and lanes. Another       
 attractive route with extensive views 
 over the Weald passes through         
 Loddington Farm and follows the       
 Greensand Ridge. The Maidstone branch 
 of the Ramblers' Association, the     
 Loose Footpaths Group, and the Suttons
 Strollers all organize regular walks  
 in this area.                         </content>
