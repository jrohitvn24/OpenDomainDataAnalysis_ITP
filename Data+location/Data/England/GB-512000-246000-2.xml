		<content> Mox Hill breaks the monotony of the   
 otherwise{flat landscape of Northill, 
 with its many woods &amp; mostly arable   
 land with some meadows. Most fields   
 are bordered by hedges and trees. The 
 area has{2 tributaries of the Ivel}and
 some man-made{reservoirs and ponds.   
{Houses}are of various architectural   
 styles,{many typical of their era,viz.
 The Grange(Queen Anne), Highlands Farm
 (Georgian),the pre-war council houses.
 There are some 16th and 17th century  
 timber-framed thatched or tiled houses
 (mainly extended),e.g.Cowhovel Row and
 The Old Brewhouse. Many private houses
 have been built postwar, but few prior
 to 1930. The only{mansion}is Park Hos-
 pital. All pre-1800 and other unusual 
 houses have been{listed Grade II}in   
 1985, e.g. house on stilts, lapboard  
 house. Cottages in Sand Lane &amp; a Tudor
 thatched one at Budna need renovation.</content>
