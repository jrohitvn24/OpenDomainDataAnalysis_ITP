		<title>15Trees,flowers in Leverton</title>
		<content> In the original Domesday survey it was
 recorded that there were 110 acres of 
 "underwood".It is doubtful if we could
 manage to record 10 acres in 1985.    
 There are some patches of standard    
 trees but Dutch elm disease disposed  
 of many large specimens which are only
 slowly being replaced.Several of the  
 trees are quite ancient but healthy   
 and make a contrast to the flat       
 landscape.Wild flowers,however,are    
 becoming rarer as modern verge cutting
 equipment is used to keep the         
 roadsides clear.Very few are allowed  
 to seed and consequently only low     
 growing plants are succeeding.Cow     
 parsley,hogweed,vetches,trefoils and  
 bindweeds can still be found but much 
 of the flag iris has now vanished.    
 Small areas of ground are left natural
 and wild plants can be found there if 
 you are prepared to look carefully.   </content>
