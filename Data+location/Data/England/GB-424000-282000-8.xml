		<title>08Meriden-Housing.</title>
		<content> Meriden lies in Green Belt land, so   
 any housing development in the area is
 strictly controlled. The village      
 contains a mixture of council and     
 privately owned dwellings, and has    
 developed in a linear fashion along   
 the length of the old Birmingham to   
 Coventry road.                        
                                       
 Any new housing development in the    
 area is either "infill" in the        
 existing development, or it involves  
 the construction of new property on   
 land which was originally built on,   
 but where the dwelling that stood     
 there has been demolished.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
