		<content> The thinly scattered population is,   
 almost without exception engaged in   
 agriculture.The houses are mainly     
 farmhouses attached to family farms   
 Work is on the family farm and few    
 farms employ outside workers. A couple
 of people are employed in activities  
 associated with agriculture such as   
 milling,and a few others have jobs in 
 local manufacturing or professional   
 work, the latter combining their jobs 
 with part-time farming.               
     It is an area where women have not
 traditionally worked outside the home 
 or farm environment, and this is still
 evident today. Only a couple of women 
 work and these do so in a part-time   
 capacity. The farmers' wives carry out
 the usual household tasks occasionally
 helping on the farm and two of them do
 Bed and Breakfast trade.
