		<title>10FARMING</title>
		<content>   There are 21 farms and 3 market     
 gardens in our area. 7 farmers have a 
 milk quota, one produces only eggs,   
 the rest grow wheat, barley and       
 potatoes, and keep sheep and beef     
 cattle. Most own their own farms which
 are mainly under 250 acres. Two farms 
 are over 500 acres. The dairy farmers 
 grow fodder, beet and most make silage
 to feed to the cattle in winter.      
  On the three market gardens, only one
 man works full time; the others have  
 jobs as well. Lots of the Chartist    
 Bungalows have 2 or 3 acres and many  
 people keep hens, goats and a few beef
 cattle but they do other jobs as well.
 There are also other small holdings of
 between 5 and 20 acres but the owners 
 all do other jobs. Some people keep   
 bees.
