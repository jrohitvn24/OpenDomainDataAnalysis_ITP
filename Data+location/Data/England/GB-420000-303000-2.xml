 The {wheat} seed is crushed to make   
flour. From the flour you can make     
bread and cakes. To make bread the     
flour is made into dough and left to   
rise before it is cooked. Then the     
bread is sent by lorry to shops where  
people buy it to make toast and        
sandwiches.                            
 Farmers keep {cows} because we can get
milk from them and from milk we can    
make butter, cream and cheese.         
 {Sheep} and cows are used for meat.   
They are taken to the slaughterhouse   
in a big  lorry where they are killed  
and the flesh is cut up to be sold for 
meat.
