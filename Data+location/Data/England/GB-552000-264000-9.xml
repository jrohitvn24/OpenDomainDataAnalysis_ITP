		<content> Climate and Weather                   
                                       
 The climate is marked by continental  
 features - extremes of temperature and
 a low annual rainfall of 21" which    
 falls all year, although a summer     
 maximum is associated with            
 thunderstorms. February is the driest 
 month, July the wettest. Prevailing   
 winds are south-westerly.             
                                       
 Footpaths                             
                                       
 Footpaths run along the banks of      
 Swaffham lode and the River; the very 
 few that cross arable fields are      
 unmarked and ploughed over. Some are  
 signposted and the Parish Council     
 keeps a record of them all.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
