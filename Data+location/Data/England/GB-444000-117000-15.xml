		<title>15FAMOUS PEOPLE IN EASTLEIGH</title>
		<content>  It was difficult to find one obvious 
 person who has been famous who has    
 links with Eastleigh,but there are    
 many who have helped the town to grow.
  One was Mr A.H.Quilley who served on 
 the local and county councils for many
 years he was chairman of the Education
 Committee and even had a school named 
 after him.He was a Freeman of         
 Eastleigh and went to Buckingham      
 Palace to receive an M.B.E.from the   
 Queen.Mr.N.F Norris also received an  
 M.B.E.from the Queen. He said the day 
 was memorable,the Queen had something 
 special to say to each person,a lot to
 remember despite an aid at her side,  
 prompting.He was asked not to shake   
 her hand too hard as she shook so many
 hands each day.Besides breakfast      
 before he left home MR Norris had     
 nothing to eat until he left the      
 palace at about 2'oclock.             </content>
