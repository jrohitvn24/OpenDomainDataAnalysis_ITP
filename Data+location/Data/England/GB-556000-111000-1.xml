		<title>01Introduction to our area.</title>
		<content> Our 12sq.kms covered the northern part
 of Hailsham in East Sussex and the    
 surrounding villages of{Hellingly,    
{Horsebridge,and Lower Dicker.}Hailsham
 is a market town of some l7000 people,
 but the picturesque village of        
{Hellingly}is the main settlement in   
 our area. The land was mainly forested
 and in later times iron and brick     
 works were found including an old     
 pottery. Todays economy is based on   
 mixed farming. The inhabitants are    
 either retired, farmers,commuters to  
 various parts of Sussex or workers in 
 a few local industries. Hellingly     
 derived its name from{'hill dwellers' 
 being situated just north of the      
 marshes. Although present during the  
 last Domesday survey it did not       
 register. Its growth has been steady  
 with many old and beautiful farms.Two 
 mental hospitals are todays features. </content>
