		<content> This single line section of the       
 Waterloo to London line was once      
 renowned for the steepness of its     
 incline - often necessitating an extra
 engine being added to the train at    
 Seton Junction. With modern diesel    
 engines and shorter trains there now  
 appears to be no problem. After       
 crossing the flood plains of the River
 Axe this section of the line is very  
 attractive being built on the slope of
 the hill above the Umborne Brook.     
 There is not a great deal of traffic  
 on this line as the Exeter-Paddington 
 line is considered to be the major    
 rail route from London to the south   
 west. In Victorian times, especially  
 at Bank holiday times, this line was  
 very busy with day trippers going to  
 Seaton and alighting at the long      
 closed Seaton Junction station at     
 nearby Shute.                         </content>
