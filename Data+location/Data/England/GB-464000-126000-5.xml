		<title>05EDUCATION IN PRIVETT</title>
		<content> The 5-11 year old children of the     
 Privett area used to attend the       
 village Church School until 1970, when
 numbers declined and the school       
 closed. The designated schools are now
 at Froxfield for infants and at       
 Langrish for juniors, who travel to   
 school by mini-bus.Some parents choose
 to send their children to Ropley      
 Primary School when there are places  
 available and in this case they are   
 responsible for their transport. At   
 11-plus the children transfer to      
 Petersfield Comprehensive School which
 has a sixth form, or to Eggar's School
 and the Sixth Form College in Alton.
