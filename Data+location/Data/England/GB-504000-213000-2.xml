		<content> The land in the East of our area is   
 mainly cereal crops,however,on the    
 West is more pasture.There are many   
 farms as it is agricultural.There are 
 a few patches of woodland,mainly      
 deciduous trees.The only villages are 
 part of Flamstead,the outskirts of    
 Markyate and a small residential area 
 called Jockey End.The relief of the   
 land is gently rolling hills.The      
 A5(main road) runs from London to     
 Holyhead and passes through our area, 
 otherwise there are just tracks and   
 narrow lanes.The only river is the Ver
 which flows alongside the A5.The      
 animals are a mixture of sheep,pigs   
 and cows.The soil profile is mainly   
 chalk underneath and either Batcombe, 
 Winchester or gravel on top.
