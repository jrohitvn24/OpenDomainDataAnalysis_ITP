		<title>13MORE CLUBS IN N.FERRIBY.</title>
		<content>  The{DRAMA SOCIETY}was first started  
 by The W.I. in 1948.Mrs.Johnson was   
 the producer then and for the next 21 
 years.First they used a little room   
 at the back of the bakery.However for 
 the last 2 years they have rehearsed  
 at Oddfellows Hall.Membership costs   
 Â£5 to join, but is free for those     
 under 18.Their last play was "Hay     
 Fever", a comedy.                     
  The{WOMEN'S INSTITUTE}started in 1925
 when women decided to form their own  
 society. We interviewed the President,
 Mrs. Pinnock, a member for four years.
 Members meet every month at the       
 Village Hall from 7.30p.m. till about 
 10p.m.They have talks ranging from    
 mugging to wildlife.At Christmas they 
 do plays and pantomimes.Ladies over 60
 dress up as fairies.The W.I. hope for 
 more younger members in the future.
