 twice weekly in the village hall.For  
 more serious illnesses there are      
 cottage hospitals at Swaffham and     
 Thetford and a modern well-equipped   
 general hospital at Kings Lynn. The   
 elderly are cared for at home or in   
 private residential homes within 20-30

 dentists etc are available in the     
 local towns.Children have a full      
 medical in their first year at school 
 and any problems encountered are      
 referred to their parents for further
