		<content>                                       
 In Cleobury there is a Police Station 
 which is un-manned because we don't   
 get much trouble here. It has got two 
 constables, P.C. Cadwallader and P.C. 
 Carpenter and Sergeant Evans. These   
 people pop in occasionally to see that
 things are all right. We are in the   
 Bridgnorth rural area.                
 There is also a Magistrates' Court in 
 Cleobury which meets on the first     
 Friday of every month. The court sits 
 in the library and, when it meets, the
 bookshelves are pushed against the    
 wall. Above the court chairs there is 
 a coat of arms, which tells us that   
 the court is in the Queen's service.  
 There is a Juvenile Court for children
 over 11 and under 17. This Court meets
 on the last Friday of every month.    
 There are four magistrates who sit at 
 each session.                         </content>
