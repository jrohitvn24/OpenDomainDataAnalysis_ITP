		<title>05Horton Priory Sellindge 1900</title>
		<content> In 1912, Horton Priory was purchased  
 by Mr.J.J.Cairnes who had made his    
 fortune from gold mining,cattle and   
 shrewed investments in America.By this
 time the building was in poor repair  
 and he spent much money restoring it  
 and adding an East Wing on the        
 probable site of the original church  
 and cloisters.In 1940 the building was
 commandeered by an anti-tank regiment 
 for defence against invasion by the   
 German army.The house became the      
 officers residence until 1944 when it 
 was returned to Mr.Cairnes and his    
 family.In 1950 Mr.Cairnes died and    
 left the property to his daughter who 
 by now had married Brigadier Gore.They
 are now the only residents of Horton  
 Priory which is their private home and
 is not open to the public.Many of the 
 architectural features of this house  
 are felt to be unique.                </content>
