		<content> Besides {managing the Park Deer and   
{Pheasant programme}, the {Head Keeper 
{and 5 assistants} must {control }the {
{pests in Wychwood }to allow the young 
{planted trees} to become established  
 for the {future}. Indigenous {Fallow  
{Deer}do the most {tree damage} and    
 damage crops too. Their numbers are   
 large but unknown because they move   
 around. They are {shot in Winter from 
{high seats with telescopic sights on  
{deer rifles. 130}were {killed}last    
 year.{ Grey Squirrels strip young     
{Beeches }and are also {controlled.}   
 Predators on eggs and young birds are 
 kept down. {Mink}, a vicious newcomer,
 are appearing.{Magpies }have increased
 greatly recently to the detriment of  
 small birds. {Carrion Crows, Stoats,  
{Weasels and Foxes }are the other main{
{predators,} who need to be kept in{   
{ecological equilibrium.}              </content>
