		<content>  Agriculture in the area is generally 
 of the mixed variety,ie livestock and 
 cereals. Whilst this may be through   
 choice, it is also dictated by the    
 terrain of the land.                  
  The cereals sown include winter      
 barley, wheat, oats and rye. Some of  
 the latter is specifically sown for   
 the local thatcher and is harvested   
 with an old reaper and binder in order
 to preserve the stalks.               
  The livestock are split 50/50 between
 sheep and cattle, with the latter     
 split 50/50 between beef rearing and  
 milking.                              
  A battery chicken farm is situated at
 Locks Drove.                          
  Shooting of pheasants takes place on 
 most farms.
