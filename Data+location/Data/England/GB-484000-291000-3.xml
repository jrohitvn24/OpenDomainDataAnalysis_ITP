Rockingham Castle is a very imposing   
building.Part of the castle dates back 
to the Normans.It is situated on the   
crest of a hill overlooking the Welland
Valley.It has always been a family home
and still is today,though it is open to
the public for two afternoons a week.  
Today it is the centre of the vast     
Rockingham estates which is largely    
given over to Farming.Recently it has  
been the focal point of a B.B.C. seris 
set in the English Civil War.Its       
influence on the area has and still is 
very considerable.
