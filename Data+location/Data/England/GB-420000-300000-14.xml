		<title>14 Environmental Problems</title>
		<content> Many trees have been planted in the   
Glascote area to replace those damaged 
by vandals. Vandalism has become a     
problem to our nature. Many saplings   
have been destroyed on purpose.        
 Recently Linear Park lake was drained 
and dredged. Many surprising items     
were found, even a moped! Our beautiful
lake continues to be used as a rubbish 
tip. The swans and our lake are at     
risk! The local canals are in a similar
state. Very little water life can be   
found in the dirty water.              
 A road has been proposed through our  
local park  which is causing much      
concern for many people. A lot of the  
nature will be destroyed and although  
it may ease traffic, it will spoil our 
surroundings.
