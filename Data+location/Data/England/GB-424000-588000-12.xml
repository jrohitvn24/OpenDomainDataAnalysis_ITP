		<title>12THIRD HOUSE FARM</title>
		<content> Third House Farm is near Ashington and
 can be aproached by the Ashington to  
 Woodhorn or the Woodhorn to Linton    
 road. The farm is aproximately 300    
 acres in size and has many animals    
 including Danish Blue cows, poultry,  
 bullocks but most of the farm is used 
 for agrigultural purposes. Buildings  
 on the farm include a silage clamp, a 
 covered cattle shed, open pens,       
 chicken coops, an empty wooden        
 building, some cottages and a farm    
 house. The farm house was built about 
 the turn of the 20th century out of   
 stone. The farm cottages were built   
 before the Second World War and were  
 also built of stone. The purpose of   
 the covered cattle shed is to house   
 the cattle and store food. The farm   
 land is mainly land reclaimed from the
 N.C.B spoilheaps which increased it's 
 area. The N.C.B still owns the farm   </content>
