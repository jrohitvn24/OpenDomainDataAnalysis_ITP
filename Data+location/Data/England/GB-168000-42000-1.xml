		<content>  This block includes the Northern part
 of Redruth, the surrounding           
 countryside and the villages of  North
 Country and Mt. Ambrose. The A30 trunk
 road crosses the block. The town (pop.
 43000) has a mainly pre-war           
 centre,dating back to the hey-day of  
 copper mining in the 1850's, a large  
 post war council estate and some      
 modern housing estates. The           
 surrounding countryside is mainly     
 permanent pasture supporting small    
 herds of beef and dairy cattle. There 
 are many disused mine shafts and      
 engine houses. South Crofty Mine in   
 the West of the block is the nearest  
 working mine and a major local        
 employer.The Cardrew Industrial Estate
 also provides employment for many     
 Redruth men- most of the businesses   
 being light industry or tourist       
 related.                              </content>
