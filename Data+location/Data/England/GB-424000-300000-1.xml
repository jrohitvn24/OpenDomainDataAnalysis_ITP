		<title>01POLESWORTH AND DORDON</title>
		<content> Polesworth is situated on the River   
                                       
 Anker at a fordable point.There was   
 a nunnery built here originally but it
 was later the development of          
 coalmining that led to its further    
 growth.More recently people have      
 been attracted from the Birmingham    
 area to private house building.The new
 M42 motorway may well add to          
 Polesworth's importance.              
          There are two markets held in
 Polesworth.A weekly outdoor market and
 on Bank Holidays a market is now held 
 at Hermitage Hill                     
          Dordon is very much a village
 centred on the colliery.It has coal   
 board and council estates and workers 
 have been attracted to the area from  
 all parts of the country. The         
 brickwork are no longer in use.The    
 whole area is surrounded by farmland. </content>
