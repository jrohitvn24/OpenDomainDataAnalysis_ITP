The older people remember going on the 
train for their holidays or on special 
excursions to the sea-side.They used   
the train to go shopping,to go to the  
pictures and some went to school in    
Wellingborough by train each day.It    
took football  supporters to           
Northampton,the return ticket was 9d   
(4p).The trains also carried coal and  
limestone to the steel works.          
In 1930 the whole station was burnt    
down,but was rebuilt later.The Royal   
Family used to come through Ringstead  
on their way to Barnwell.              
Unfortunately the line was closed in   
1965.
