		<content>                                       
                                       
Our block is part of the district of   
Richmondshire in the county of North   
Yorkshire. The area we studied is very 
much a rural area,there are only two   
small settlements;Kirby Hill and       
Washton,and a few isolated farms and   
houses.Most of the land is above 250   
Metres,much of the south and west of   
our block being moorland and used for  
rough grazing.                         
 Farming is the principal economic     
activty of this area, in the past few  
years there has been a shift to arable 
farming where the land is suitable.    
Most of the land is used for grazing   
sheep and cattle.                      
 There are sizeable areas of private   
woodland in our block.Much of the west 
of our area is used by the Army.
