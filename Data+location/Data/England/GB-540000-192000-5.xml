		<title>05TRANSPORT IN BUCKHURST HILL</title>
		<content>   The roads in this area have two main
 purposes,a) to move traffic in &amp; out  
 of London,b)local use.There are two   
 roads which deal with the first.the   
 A11 goes from London to Newmarket. It 
 is an old coaching road,so has a      
 number of old coaching inns,such as   
 the Horse &amp; Wells pub at Woodford.It  
 is busy road carrying mostly cars as  
 the heavy traffic now goes on the     
 M11.The motorway runs parallel to the 
 A11 up to Cambridge.It runs along the 
 R.Roding Valley. Running in between   
 these two roads is the under ground   
 central line.We have 3 stations in our
 block.B-Hill, R.Roding &amp; Chigwell.This
 service is used alot by commuters &amp;   
 causes problems with car parking,     
 especially in Queens Rd in            
 B.Hill.Buses run regulary,though fares
 are expensive.
