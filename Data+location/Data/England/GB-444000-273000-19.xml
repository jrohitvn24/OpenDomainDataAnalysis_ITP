		<title>19Church Lawford Aerodrome 1</title>
		<content> Church Lawford a village close to Long
 Lawford has a disused airfield        
 within it,although to say it is not   
 used id not strictly correct as it's  
 runways are used as a training ground 
 for truck drivers.Part of the rest of 
 the airfield is used by the Royal     
 Observer Corps. as a local            
 headquarters.Most of the original     
 buildings are still in place and still
 occasionally used for military        
 storage, though very rarely now.      
  The aerodrome seems to have been     
 built some time in the early 1930's   
 and initially it was a private        
 airfield which seems to have as a     
 claim to fame the fact that planes    
 like 'The Flying Flea' performed      
 stunts there at several air shows.    
 Other attractions at these shows      
 organised by Sir Alan Cobham were     
 gliding and parachuting.              </content>
