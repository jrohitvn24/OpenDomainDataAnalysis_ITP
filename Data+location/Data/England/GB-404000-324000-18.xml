		<title>18THE VILLAGE FETE</title>
		<content> On Saturday I went to the fete at the 
 lowers. I dressed   up as an old      
 fashioned princess with a tall hat    
 with a veil coming down the back. Just
 before the procession started I was   
 given a collecting box. When the      
 procession started I collected money. 
 I got left behind because I was busy  
 collecting money. When the procession 
 was over I gave my box in. I sat      
 outside the tennis courts and watched 
 the horn dance. It was very good. Some
 horn dancers had brown horns and the  
 others had white horns.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
