		<title>10RECREATION IN STAMBOURNE 2</title>
		<content>   The Conservative Association holds a
 summer fete and a Village Supper.     
 Whist drives take place in the village
 hall. Fund-raising events for the     
 church, such as fetes, perform a      
 social function. The Stambourne       
 Singers, a small chamber choir, meet  
 in the house of members living in     
 Stambourne, but all the other members 
 come from other villages.             
  For all other leisure and recreation 
 facilities, villages travel to nearby 
 towns. The nearest sports centre and  
 swimming pool is at Haverhill, cinema 
 at Halstead, theatre at Sudbury. The  
 major centres of Cambridge, Bury St.  
 Edmunds, Colchester and Chelmsford are
 all about 25 miles away. There are no 
 buses to or from Stambourne in the    
 evenings.
