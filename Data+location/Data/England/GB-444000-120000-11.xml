		<title>11THOUGHTS ON CRESTWOOD CENTRE</title>
		<content> One person who regularly uses the     
 Centre looks at the North Eastleigh   
 development as a 'village' because it 
 is smaller than a town but larger than
 a hamlet and when she visits the      
 complex it's like going down to the   
 village hall to meet the local        
 neighbours.Another person thought that
 the building when lit up was like a   
{'Cruise Ship"}passing in the night for
 he could hear disco music being       
 emitted and along with the people     
 attending Keep Fit, Ballet, Meetings, 
 Classes, and the Bar Lounge, it all   
 contributes to an exciting nightly    
 entertainment programme. My favourite 
 description was that the red building 
 was their{'Space Centre'}with their   
 own house as the satellite and from an
 architectural point of view you could 
 say that the sunshaped building emits 
 heatrays and attracts people inside.  </content>
