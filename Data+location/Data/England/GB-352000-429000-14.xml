		<title>14PRESTON'S UNIQUE CLASSROOM</title>
		<content>      Children at Kennington County    
 Primary School start their education  
 in a classroom which is the only one  
 of its type in the world. Erected in  
 1974 the ICOSAHEDRON is made of fire- 
 proof material. Because of its shape  
 it is nick-named the 'Bubble'. It has 
 20 sides, each made up of 3           
 equilateral triangles. The windows are
 all along the bottom but don't open.  
 The air conditioning keeps it from    
 being too hot or cold. The outside is 
 unpainted and needs no maintenance.   
 The inside cannot be spoilt by        
 vandalism. At present there are 35    
 children, a teacher and a nursery     
 assistant. The children learn to read 
 and write, enjoy painting, watch T.V. 
 programmes and practise plays for the 
 school. The children love being in the
 'Bubble' with it's feeling of space   
 and safety.                           </content>
