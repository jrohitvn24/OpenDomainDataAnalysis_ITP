		<content> The building of the police station    
 was started in 1973 and was finished  
 in 1974. The official opening was 18th
 March 1974. The old police station    
 was where  Social Services is now     
 standing on  Roman Bank. The new      
 police station is a building  on Park 
 Avenue and is the tallest building in 
 Skegness.The pay of the first police  
 constables was 75p a week. In 1929    
 they were getting paid Â£1.05 then in  
 1938 it went up to Â£4.47 a week.      
 Altogether there are ten cells,6 for  
 men,2 for women and 2 for juveniles.  
 The police have 3 police cars out in  
 the summer and 2 in winter. In the    
 police station there are two dog      
 kennels.In Skegness the most trouble  
 occurs on Bank Holidays and there are 
 5 in a year, but 26 to 30 more men    
 come to patrol the streets.
