		<content> In our area we have a Brick Works at  
 Selborne.The Brick Works make bricks  
 partly by hand.The factory is fairly  
 small and does not produce mass       
 bricks.The factory is                 
 quite old.It is not very central and  
 it is not very near to any means of   
 transportation either.Another         
 Industrial works is the Trading Estate
 in Whitehill,it is quite big but is   
 not all that busy.The Trading Estate  
 is quite new to Whitehill and is built
 in a very modern style.At the back of 
 the building the Army practice with   
 their tanks and other Army            
 vehicles.The estate has roughly forty 
 factory units which store things and  
 manufacture things.But in our area    
 there are only twenty two factory     
 units.The grid reference for the      
 factory units 794 349.
