		<content> Mrs Thorpe the school secretary is a  
 member of the W.I. She remembers her  
 Mother helping during the war with W. 
 I. work. All surplus soft fruit was   
 collected from all the villages in the
 area, taken to Whixley Hall where it  
 was made into jam to be sold to local 
 shops. They used primus stoves to     
 boil the jam because there was no     
 electricity in the washhouse. Some    
 villages took surplus produce to York 
 Market each Saturday morning to sell. 
 The W.I. nowadays meets once each     
 month at Whixley Village Hall. They   
 have speakers, demonstrations and     
 competitions.They cater for village   
 activities such as fetes and sports.  
 They have joint meeting with other    
 groups in September. The officers at  
 the moment are Mrs.A. Watson,         
 President and Mrs P. Orton,Secretary.
