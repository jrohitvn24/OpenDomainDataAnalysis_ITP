		<title>02MATERNITY HOSPITAL, HULL</title>
		<content> Hedon Road Maternity Hospital serves  
 the large population in this area. It 
 is very busy.There are some smaller   
  hospitals, public and private        
 to assist it.                         
 Hedon Road is the best equipped of the
 hospitals and emergencies from the    
 others are brought here.              
 The buildings were first used as a    
 "Fever Hospital" but as the general   
 health of the country has improved,   
 due to better food and medicine, and  
 centralised maternity hospitals could 
 now offer a safer place for having    
 babies than the home its designation  
 was changed.                          
 Recently their has been a (small)     
 trend to stay at home and have the    
 baby naturally instead of in the      
 depersonalised, sterilised theatres of
 the hospital.                         
                                       </content>
