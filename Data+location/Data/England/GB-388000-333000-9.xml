		<title>09The Canal at Stone</title>
		<content>As the Trent and Mersey canal passes   
through Stone,we went along to see it. 
In the olden times the canal was used  
for pulling cargo.Now it is used for   
holidays and pleasure.On the canal     
there are two bridges and four locks.  
The Southern lock is called the Star   
lock and the Northern lock is called   
the Top lock.There is a shop which     
sells equipment, boats, sweets, ropes, 
shoes and maps.We questioned three     
people.Two of them were on holiday     
and the other person was also just     
going for pleasure.The Star Inn is by  
the Star Lock and the Rising Sun Inn   
is by the Top Lock.There are two boat  
yards in Stone where boats can be hired
for holiday cruising.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
