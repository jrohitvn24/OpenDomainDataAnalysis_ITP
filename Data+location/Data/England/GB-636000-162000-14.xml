		<content>The local police force has over 100    
personnel and covers the Ramsgate area 
Sandwich and rural area.The station is 
over 100 years old and has 7 cells.The 
most common local crimes are petty     
theft and shoplifting but nearly half  
of the crimes are solved.Busiest times 
are  Friday and Saturday nights because
of disorderly behaviour after pubs     
close.We told Chief Inspector Wall what
our parents survey had found-that they 
were worried about the increase in anti
social behaviour,aggression &amp; violence 
of youngsters.Children as young as 7   
are involved in crime.One of the main  
causes is lack of discipline at home.  
Crime is increasing everywhere and the 
policeman's job is becoming more       
difficult. The public attitude of "I   
don't want to get involved" is very    
unhelpful to the police and allows     
criminals to escape conviction.        </content>
