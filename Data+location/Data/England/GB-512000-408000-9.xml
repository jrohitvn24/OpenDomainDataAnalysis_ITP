		<title>09LIFE IN A VILLAGE</title>
		<content> As part of the project we did a study 
 of the people who live in the village.
 Most people go shopping to Grimsby    
 each week to do their shopping.Quite  
 a number of husbands accompany their  
 wives when they do the weekly shopping
 There is only one shop in the village 
 which serves as a post office as well 
 The shop sells most of the every day  
 needs of the people such as groceries,
 newspapers,sweets and cigarettes.     
 There is a mobile butchers van which  
 comes around the village once a week. 
 There is also a mobile library van    
 which visits the village weekly. A    
 very long time ago there was a variety
 of shops in the village but these have
 long since gone with the greater      
 mobility of the people, many of whom  
 have cars. This year the shop has been
 robbed twice. Once the safe was stolen
 The culprits were never found.        </content>
