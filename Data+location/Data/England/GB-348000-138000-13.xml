		<content> Most families in Glastonbury rely on  
 their cars for transport in their     
 everyday life. Many have to travel out
 of the town for work and shopping.The 
 bus service,limited and expensive, is 
 the only public transport.            
{St. John's Infants}and{St. Benedict's 
{Junior}schools provide for Primary Ed-
 ucation, whilst{St. Dunstan's}offers  
 Comprehensive Education for 11 to 16  
 year olds. Those students who wish to 
 continue their education must then    
 transfer to the{Tertiary College}in   
 Street.  Certain courses are only     
 offered at colleges in Taunton, Yeovil
 and Bridgwater.                       
 Glastonbury's slower pace of living   
 attracts many elderly people who wish 
 to spend their retirement in tranquil 
 rural surroundings, away from the rush
 and tear of city life.
