		<content>     THE HOLDERNESS PLOUGH COMPANY     
     The Holderness Plough Company is a
 firm of Agricultural Suppliers, now   
 owned by the Elswick-Hopper Company of
 Lincolnshire. It employs eleven       
 people.                               
     Originally one of the village     
 blacksmith's, they later began to make
 ploughs. The owner at that time was   
 called Stamford and he made a plough  
 specially for the Holderness area. It 
 became well known as the Holderness   
 Plough, and so did the company.       
     After the Industrial Revolution,  
 they became agents for making and     
 repairing all kinds of farm machinery.
 They now act as agents for tractor    
 companies from all over the world.    
     Nowadays, they only make small    
 items such as storage bins, pipes and 
 wrought iron gates.
