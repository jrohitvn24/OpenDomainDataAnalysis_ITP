		<title>17DAY IN LIFE OF PAULINE (11)</title>
		<content> I wake about 7 I amble downstairs to  
 find breakfast and my mum.Mum goes to 
 work at 8.30 and we go to school.I    
 stop off at the school pond.After the 
 whistle we scramble into school.I go  
 to the hall to play my recorder in the
 orchestra.The morning I might spend   
 doing Maths, English, Topic, Science, 
 Art, Music or whatever.We have a break
 at 10.30 and lunch at 12.On Fridays I 
 eat quickly as I have Nature club,    
 news of plants and animals and the    
 back breaking and knee scratching     
 affair of gardening. During the       
 afternoon we may have P.E. and story  
 which is my favourite. We bundle out  
 of school at 3.30 but I stay on for   
 science club which is riddled with    
 computers, printers, experiments and  
 robots! After a hurried dinner I go to
 Guides at 7 then have a quick supper  
 before bed which I am glad to see.    </content>
