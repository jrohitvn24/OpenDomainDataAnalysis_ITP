  June 4th. 1985.                      
                                       
 Today my day is going to be milking   
 because it is his turn.               
  We have about one hundred cows so I  
 have to wait till dad comes in.       
  On Mondays my mum goes to choir with 
 Mrs.Morrish but I don't think she is  
 going today because Mrs.Morrish is in 
 hospital.                             
  My mum does go to work but not this  
 week because she is having a holiday  
 from work because the ladies at       
 Kirdford Growers are cleaning at the  
 moment.She does the sorting out of the
 apples and she gets paid a lot of     
 money.                                
                                       </content>
