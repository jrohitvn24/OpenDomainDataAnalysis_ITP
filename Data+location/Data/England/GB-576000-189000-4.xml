		<content> The area has a variety of habitats,   
 but two predominate, namely copse     
 woodland and hedged arable fields. The
 remainder comprises plotland          
 development and housing estates.      
{Wildlife }includes badgers, foxes,    
 squirrels, and a wide variety of bird 
 life although some well developed     
 hawthorn copse is being destroyed to  
 accommodate housing.                  
 There are two areas of common land    
 still surviving from the Middle       
 Ages:the Great Common and the Little  
 Common. Large oaks dominate the       
 former, with the grass ground cover   
 being controlled by the council       
 gardeners.                            
 The area is a dry one averaging 630mm 
 of rain per year and a slightly higher
 incidence of frost being on a n orth  
 facing slope.
