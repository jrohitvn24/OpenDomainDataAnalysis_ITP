		<content>  {Shopping facilities in Gt.Broughton.
                                       
         The shops in Gt.Broughton sell
 a variety of goods. People rely on the
 shops for everyday things and are able
 to buy bread,fresh fruit,vegetables   
 and meat. Dairy products are sold in  
 two shops. Stationery and gifts are   
 sold at the Post Office. Ice-cream,   
 sweets and soft drinks are on sale in 
 all three shops.                      
                                       
        Most people walked to the shop.
 One person came on their bicycle. Some
 people shop locally, weekly, daily or 
 casually. One person said they shopped
 for ice-cream mostly and one girl said
 sweets. Others just said daily        
 groceries. Most people visit large    
 supermarkets in Stokesley or          
 Middlesbrough and told us that they   
 would miss the local village shops.   </content>
