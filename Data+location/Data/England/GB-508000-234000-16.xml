 Wrest Park is situated close to Silsoe
 where the countryside is typically    
 flat with views of the Chilterns. The 
 estate is leased to the N.I.A.E. who  
 take pride in their role of preserving
 the house and gardens as a National   
 Monument.In the early 1900's Wrest    
 Park was the residence of the American
 Ambassador, while during the l914-18  
 war it was used as a military hospital
 In 1947 the Ministry of Public        
 Buildings and Works aquired the estate
 Wrest Park is famous for its Gardens. 
 The Great Garden of which the Pavilion
 is the most dominant feature was laid 
 out by Thomas Archer, in the formal   
 manner and altered by 'Capability     
 Brown between l758 and l760. There is 
 also an Orangery.                     </content>
