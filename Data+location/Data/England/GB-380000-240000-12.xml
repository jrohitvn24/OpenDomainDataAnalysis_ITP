		<title>12Hanley Castle Parish Council</title>
		<content> The Parish Council serves the         
 community and makes representation of 
 the needs of this area to the Malvern 
 Hills District Council.(Controlling   
 body for this area.) The Council meets
 four times a year,its venue           
 alternating between Hanley Swan       
 Village Hall and Hanley Castle High   
 School. Perhaps the most important    
 change in Hanley Swan has been the    
 alteration of the cross roads in 1982.
 The Parish had been pressurising the  
 County Council to alter this dangerous
 road junction, as it had been the     
 scene of several deaths and numerous  
 minor road accidents during the last  
 twenty years. Their efforts on behalf 
 of the community were rewarded and    
 happily since the alteration there    
 have been no "crashes" at the cross   
 roads by Hanley Swan pool.They have   
 planted trees to beautify the area.   </content>
