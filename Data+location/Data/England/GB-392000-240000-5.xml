		<content> After the wheat has been stored, it   
 goes to the mill. At the mill it is   
 stored until it is needed to make     
 animal feed. Hay is made in June and  
 July. From 40 acres of grass you can  
 make 4500-5000 bales of hay. Most hay 
 is used to feed dairy cattle, sheep   
 and horses. Barley straw is sold as   
 cattle feed and wheat straw is sold   
 for cattle bedding. The main costs in 
 growing arable crops are fertilizers  
 and sprays. The main weeds you get in 
 corn are wild oats, black grass,      
 clover and may weed, and the main     
 weeds in grass are thistles and dock. 
{Mr. Dyson's Market Garden:-}Mr. Dyson 
 told me that he has six 2000sq.feet   
 greenhouses, one 1200sq.ft greenhouse 
 and a 6000sq.ft greenhouse that moves.
 He moves it three times a year. He    
 grows vegetables which he sends to    
 market. Some he sell locally.         </content>
