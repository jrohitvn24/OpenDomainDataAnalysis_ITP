		<title>05ECOLOGY - FARMING</title>
		<content> There are 5 farms in the study area, 3
 are mixed and 2 solely arable.  They  
 vary in size from 400 to 600 acres.   
 The flat land on the plateau has      
 shallow limestone soils and is devoted
 to mainly cereals, with some sheep.   
 The valley soils rear beef cattle.    
 Barley and wheat have the greatest    
 acreage, with some oats, turnips and  
 potatoes.  Wheat yields about 2 1/2   
 tons per acre with heavy use of       
 fertilizers.  Extremes of weather do  
 occur with winter blizzards and summer
 drought being the main hazards, though
 not in 1985.  The arable farms have   
 massive investment in machinary, but  
 are no longer the main source of      
{employment}in the village.  Two farms 
 have prestigious farmhouses which     
 suggests prosperity.
