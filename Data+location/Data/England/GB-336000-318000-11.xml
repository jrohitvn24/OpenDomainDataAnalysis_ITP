		<title>11NESSCLIFFE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school is not very big.  It has   
 only about 6O children.  Some of the  
 children come from abroad and live on 
 the army camp.  We only have three    
 classes.  Our teachers are called Mrs 
 Brittain, Miss Campbell and Mrs       
 Nugent. The outside of our school is  
 brick, it used to be tiled.  In       
 March they put in bricks instead and  
 new windows even though the school is 
 not very old.  We have a big field to 
 play football on and a concrete pitch 
 to play netball and football.  In the 
 corner is a climbing frame. Before the
 school was built there was another    
 school on the main road.  It is about 
 22O years old.  They stopped using it 
 in l965.  It is built of sandstone and
 had a bell on top which rang for the  
 start of school.  Before the school   
 there was a chapel called St Mary's of
 the Rocks built there.                </content>
