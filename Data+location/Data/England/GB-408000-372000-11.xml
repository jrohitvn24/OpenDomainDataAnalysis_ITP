		<title>11KING STERNDALE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>       In the village, the only        
 occupations available are in farming. 
 Most of the villagers work in the     
 nearby quarries or they travel outside
 our 'block' to work. They go to work  
 in their cars; {there is no public    
{transport at all.}The people who      
 haven't got cars rely on their        
 neighbours.                           
      {There are no shops in the       
{village, not even a little corner     
{shop or a post office.}There is one   
 telephone box opposite Green Farm.Most
 of the villagers do their shopping in 
 Buxton once a week. There is no       
 playing area for children.            
       At the moment, there is an      
 enquiry being conducted about{Tarmac  
{Quarry's plans to extend its workings.
 The villagers don't want the face to  
 be only 50 feet from the ends of their
 gardens.                              </content>
