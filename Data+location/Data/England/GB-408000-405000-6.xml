		<content> 1.  After tea I have a cornet lesson  
 with my Dad.  On Tuesday and Friday   
 evenings I go to band practice with   
 Hade Edge Band.  There are lots of    
 brass bands around this area.         
                                       
 2.  When I arrive home from school I  
 collect the house key from our        
 neighbour, as my Mum is still at work 
 at that time.  My brothers attend the 
 local Primary School and they arrive  
 home at 4.00 pm.  My Mum comes home at
 4.15 pm and she then makes tea for us.
 We have to take turns to help wash the
 dishes.                               
                                       
 3.  The Youth Club is from 7.00 pm    
 until 9.00 pm.  It costs 5 pence to   
 get in.  There is a disco room, a     
 games room and another where you can  
 bake.                                 
 4.After tea I practice violin or piano</content>
