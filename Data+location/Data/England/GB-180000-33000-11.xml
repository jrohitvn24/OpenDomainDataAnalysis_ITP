		<title>11LOCAL CHARACTER MRS SOULT</title>
		<content>     We interviewed Mrs.Kay Soult who  
 lives in Flushing. She is a local     
 charactor,who has been in Cornwall    
 all her life. First of all she taught 
 at Flushing Primary School. Then the  
 Goverment made a rule that all        
 children over the age of eleven had to
 go to a secondary school. This was    
 situated in Penryn, but until the new 
 school was built they used temporary  
 buildings down at the quarry in       
 Falmouth. In 1961 Penryn Comprehensive
 School was opened. Mrs.Kay Soult came 
 to this school with all the children. 
 Here she taught the remedials.        
 Mrs. soult retired in 1981 after many 
 happy years of teaching.
