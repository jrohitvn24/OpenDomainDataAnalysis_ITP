		<content>The local community policeman is well  
known, but is not a resident in the    
area. He is based in Eccleshall. If    
necessary police from Stafford are sent
for to deal with any major crime. For  
example, Stafford police investigated  
and found a local arsonist who was     
responsible at various times for,      
vandalising the church, trying to set  
fire to Bishop's Wood and burning      
down two barns.                        
In recent years there have been several
burglaries in the area, and in each    
case thieves stole antiques.           
Apart from the odd poacher, there is   
very little crime in the area. There   
are no concentrations of young people  
to lead to vandalism or rough          
behaviour.
