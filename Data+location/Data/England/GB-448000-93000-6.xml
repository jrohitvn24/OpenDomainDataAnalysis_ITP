		<content>     3.30 pm                           
           At 3.30 I went home from    
 school in the car.  When I got home I 
 got a phone call from Elizabeth.  She 
 asked me if I wanted to go to her     
 house for tea.  I said "Yes", so my   
 mum took me to her house. We played in
 the back garden for awhile, then we   
 had tea.  We had mince, potato and    
 peas.                                 
    7.00 pm                            
           When I had finished it was  
 nearly time for me to go home.  When  
 it was 7.00 I went home and watched   
 telly for awhile.  I saw Tomorrow's   
 World, Top of the Pops and Little and 
 Large.                                
                                       
    9.00 pm                            
           At 9.00 I went to bed.
