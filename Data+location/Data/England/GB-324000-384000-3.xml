		<title>03A typical day in my life</title>
		<content>     This morning i woke up at 7.45 to 
 go to school. I got ready and went    
 down stairs for my breakfast. Once I  
 had finished my breakfast, I brushed  
 my hair and went to school with       
 Catherine.     When I got to school,  
  Mrs.Thomas took the register and we  
 lined up to go down to the hall,where 
 the radio broadcast was on.           
     When we came out,we all went back 
 to the classroom to do some work. At  
 playtime,we all went out onto the     
 field. The whistle went and went to do
 my prefects duty.Then we came inside  
 and carried on with S.M.P.(maths)     
 which we do nearly every day. Later,we
 did local studies and played rounders.
 When I got home I had my tea and at   
 7.30 I watched T.V until bedtime.
