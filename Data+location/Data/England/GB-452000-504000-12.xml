		<title>12I Like Great Broughton</title>
		<content> I like living in{Gt. Broughton}       
 because it is in the country and I    
 have lots of friends. There is not    
 much to do in form of entertainment   
 during the holidays.                  
     However the hills  are nearby  so 
 it is not difficult to go for a walk. 
        My dad often goes down to play 
 tennis at the sports club. I usually  
 go when there is a tournament on      
 because there is a good chance that   
 other children will be there.         
        In {Kirby}there is a church    
 with lots of big trees growing round  
 . There is an {old school}which is now
 being converted in to a house.        
      Down {Kirby }road there is an old
 hall , this is the oldest building in 
 the area.                             
      Busby is a small village. It has 
 12 houses and a telepone booth.
