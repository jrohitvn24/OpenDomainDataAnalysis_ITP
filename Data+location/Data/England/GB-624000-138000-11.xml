		<title>11CAMPING SITES IN CAPEL</title>
		<content>   There are eight camping sites in the
 Capel area,including two in the       
 Warren. In addition three local farms 
 allow summer camping.                 
   The oldest camp in the Warren,now   
 run by the Camping and Caravanning    
 Club,was set up well before the Second
 World War next to a railway halt(now  
 no longer in use).Apart from one      
 residential caravan site,the rest stay
 open from April to September,offering 
 transit and long stay facilities.     
   Capel_le_Ferne is very popular for  
 camping because.........              
 a)It is on the A20 near the Channel   
 Ports.                                
 b)Dover and Folkestone are popular    
 holiday resorts but do not have       
 campsites themselves.                 
 c)It is near the sea,has very good    
 views towards France and is a base for
 East Kent,Canterbury and Romney Marsh.</content>
