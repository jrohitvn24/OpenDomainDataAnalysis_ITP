		<content>   Before 1913, when a flying boat base
 was established at Calshot Spit, the  
 area was fields and marshland. Calshot
 today is a small village with two     
 Communities, split by the road to the 
 beach. Calshot Close area to the east 
 is used as married quarters for the   
 army based at Marchwood. Tristan Close
 on the west is the original R.A.F.    
 quarters. This is also where the      
 people of Tristan da Cunha lived when 
 they had to flee their island because 
 of volcanic action in 1961. Each      
 estate has its own community club with
 activities for adults and children who
 also have their own play areas. There 
 is a general store, P.O. and a garage.
 St. Georges chapel has a service each 
 Sunday. The Flying Boat Inn which     
 serves food and drink was the original
 officers mess. The stony beach near   
 Calshot has weekend huts for tourists.</content>
