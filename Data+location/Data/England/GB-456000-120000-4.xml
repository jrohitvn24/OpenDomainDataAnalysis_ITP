		<title>04FARMING IN CORHAMPTON FOREST</title>
		<content> Farming in this area is mostly arable.
 There is a dairy farm, beef cattle and
 a small number of sheep brought in for
 winter fattening and a stud farm.     
 Arable crops other than wheat and     
 barley include, oil seed rape for     
 vegetable oil, grass for seed and     
 linseed. Some arable land is devoted  
 to cover crops such as kale and maize,
 for pheasant shooting.                
 Some very steep fields are under      
 cultivation.Most farms have a large   
 dryer unit for crops.                 
                                       
 STRAW DISPOSAL: Through lack of demand
 for thatching and livestock use, straw
 has to be disposed of through         
 controlled burning in the fields.It is
 sad that local authorities and modern 
 villages do not allow for this product
 to be processed: ground down for      
 feeding stuff or building materials.  </content>
