		<content>     Land rises to 122m. N.E. of West  
 Wickham. Lowest point 83m. N.W. of    
 West Wickham, where there are disused 
 chalk pits (Now being filled).        
     Undulating farmland, interspersed 
 by small deciduous and mixed woods of 
 1-3 hectares. Evidence of the removal 
 of hedges. Hedges bordering the roads 
 of blackthorn, elder, hawthorn, etc.. 
 Little evidence of wild flowers.      
     Small mammals such as hares, bats,
 foxes and snipe have been seen, also  
 bred pheasants,horses,goats,falcons.  
     There are 17 kilometers of foot-  
 paths in the region although these are
 not always accessible, due to farmers 
 ploughing them up.                    
     Pollution problems include noise  
 from low flying military aircraft,    
 some stubble burning and aerial spray-
 ing of crops.                         
     This is generally a dry cold area.</content>
