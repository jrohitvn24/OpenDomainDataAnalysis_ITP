		<content>  We have about fifty to eighty        
 five{houses}in our area,nine are{farms
 ,the dates when they  were made vary  
 in age.                               
 There are four different kinds of     
 houses;detached,semi-detached,terraced
 and bungalow.                         
  Fifty new{houses}are going to        
 be built in the field next to Turpits 
 Lane in the near future.              
  The old fort is a house in a way     
 because people sleep there.           
 The area we are covering is big but   
 there are not many houses in it       
 because of the type of land.There can 
 not be many houses built anyway       
 because the area is close to the blast
 area for BP.                          
  The largest house in the area is     
 Borreas Hill which used to be a manor 
 farm.                                 
                                       </content>
