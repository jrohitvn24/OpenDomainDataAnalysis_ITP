    Ulley Hall Farm is an arable farm  
 of four hundred and seventy one       
 acres.It is situated at the east end  
 of Ulley and the large farmhouse was  
 built by Sam Burke in 1718.The present
 farmer is Mr.Longford,who like the    
 other farmers in Ulley is a tenant    
 farmer.Most of the land is still owned
 by Lord Halifax.                      
    Being an arable farm a great deal  
 of equipment is required to keep the  
 farm working.The combine harvesters   
 are owned by the farmer and cost      
 around thirty five thousand pounds    
 each.They also own huge grain drying  
 plants,tractors and rollers.The grain 
 drying plants are a great help to the 
 farmer should the weather at harvest  
 time be bad.Helicopters are used to   
 spray fertiliser on the crops.        </content>
