		<title>13Changes in 48 years in Skeg.</title>
		<content> My Gran lives at 36 Seaview Flats and 
 she has lived in Skegness for 48      
 years.She came to live in Skegness    
 when she was 15 years old.She has told
 me about some of the changes she's    
 seen in Skegness.On Lumley Road the   
 fronts of Victorian shops were        
 more impressive.There were no slot    
 machines and roads were much quieter. 
 It was often busy at nights because of
 the night trips. There used to be     
 Butlins Amusements were Bottons is.The
 Hotel on South Parades are now flats. 
 Parade Cinema is the Penny  Parade    
 Amusements and the Centre Cinema is   
 the Bingo Club on Roman Bank across   
 the road from the Library. The pier   
 had shows and a theatre. On Seaview   
 car park there were shops and and an  
 African Village. One day a man put his
 head in the lion's mouth and the lion 
 killed him.                           </content>
