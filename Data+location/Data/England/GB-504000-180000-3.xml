		<title>03GRAND UNION CANAL</title>
		<content> Over 2 million people nationwide use  
 the Grand Union Canal for recreational
 purposes such as fishing,jogging,     
 walking and in some place canoeing.   
 The trouble with fishing is all the   
 tackle obstructs walkers and joggers  
 on the narrow towpath although        
 it is used as an everyday pedestrian  
 highway.Pleasure cruising has         
 increased in the last 10 years.The    
 activity seems to favour the summer   
 months while in winter it is          
 relatively quiet you can hire a boat  
 for leisure orr to take you from one  
 place to another.The nearest place to 
 hire a boat is at the Packet Boat     
 Basin,Cowley. However the canal is    
 used for employment purposes such as  
 carrying cargo,scrap metals and farm  
 products.
