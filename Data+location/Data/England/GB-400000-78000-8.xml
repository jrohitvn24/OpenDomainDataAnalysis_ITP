		<title>08A DOCTOR'S LIFE SWANAGE</title>
		<content>   My Dad is G.P. in Swanage. He starts
 his day at 7.00am by going to mass. At
 8.00am he goes to the Cottage Hospital
 to see his hospital patients. He then 
 goes to the Health Centre and does    
 his morning surgery. He sees about 20 
 people with tummy aches, sore thoats, 
 bad chests and many other problems.   
   After morning surgery he makes house
 calls to all the people who are too   
 ill to go to the Health Centre. He    
 then dashes home for some lunch. Most 
 afternoons he makes more home visits. 
 He takes evening surgery at 4.30pm    
   On Tuesdays he spends all day at the
 Cottage Hospital operating. On        
 Wednesdays he sees all the pregnant   
 mothers.                              
   In the summer he has an extra       
 surgery to see all the holiday makers 
 who are taken ill during their        
 holidays.                             </content>
