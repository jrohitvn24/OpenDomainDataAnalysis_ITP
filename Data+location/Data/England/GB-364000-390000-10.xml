		<title>10Living in Birchwood</title>
		<content>{Birchwood Newtown consists of 3       
 villages,Locking Stumps,Oakwood and   
 Gorse Covert.Most people have moved   
 into Oakwood in the last 4 years.They 
 came because they wanted a            
 cleaner,healthier environment for     
 their children. They like the open    
 spaces,the greenery and the quiet.Most
 came from urban areas like Greater    
 Manchester and Merseyside but others  
 are ex-Armed Services families.       
 The chief criticisms are roaming      
 dogs,lack of footpaths on the main    
 roads,poor provision for the          
 pre-schoolchild and no swimming       
 pool.The rented houses are            
 spacious,modern and conveniently      
 situated.They have central-heating    
 and large gardens.Many are now buying 
 the houses.The private houses are also
 well planned.There is a wide choice   
 withprices ranging fromÂ£20000 toÂ£45000</content>
