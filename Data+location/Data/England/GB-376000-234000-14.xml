		<title>14BUILDINGS IN THE BERROW AREA</title>
		<content>{DOMESTIC:}The sector is rich in half- 
 timbered buildings, mainly 17th       
 Century, but some much older, mostly  
 modernised. There are a number of red 
 brick houses of Georgian type and some
 built in the 19th and early 2Oth      
 Century but few built since the 1939  
 war. {FARM BUILDINGS:}Combine the     
 ancient with the modern, many barns   
 rebuilt on ancient bases and at least 
 one Cruck-beamed barn still standing, 
 this at Holiday Farm.                 
{PUBLIC BUILDINGS:}The Duke of York    
 Inn- possibly a 17th Century Pilgrims'
 Inn; the School- built in 1846, now   
 used as a Village Hall; Hollybush     
 Church- a small simple stone-built    
 towerless church; St. Faith's Church- 
 part Norman, simple lines, unspoilt,  
 stone and rubble masonry, impressive  
 "embattled" tower and 14th Century oak
 porch.                                </content>
