		<content> In Kingston, Bishopsbourne and the    
 immediate surrounding areas, there is 
 mains drainage but septic tanks are   
 still used in the isolated dwellings. 
 Refuse is collected weekly. Telephones
 and electricity are available to all, 
 but mains gas only reaches the two    
 villages. Practically all homes would 
 have hot and cold water and bathroom. 
 The newer houses, and those which have
 been modernised, have central heating,
 using either gas, electricity, oil or 
 solid fuel. Most households contain   
 the more usual electrical appliances, 
 e.g. vacuum cleaner, washing machine, 
 iron, hairdryer and refrigerator. Deep
 freezers prove particularly useful in 
 rural areas. Less common were dish-   
 washers, tumbler dryers and micro-wave
 ovens. T.V. and/or radio appear in all
 homes, and vidoe recordering machines 
 are gaining in popularity.            </content>
