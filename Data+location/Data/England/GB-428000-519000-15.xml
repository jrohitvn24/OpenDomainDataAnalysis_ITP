		<content>     The major issue which has provoked
 action from the people in the area is 
 over the{dangerous state of the A167  
 road since a serious accident took    
 place at the turn-off for Brafferton. 
 Local people have been agitating for  
 changes to make the road safer because
 the road junction lies just below the 
 crest of a hill and the fast moving   
 traffic makes it difficult to cross   
 safely.                               
                                       
    An{inspector}did visit the site and
 recommended levelling the hill but as 
 thus would have meant the demolition  
 of some cottages it was not regarded  
 as practicable or acceptable.         
                                       
    Traffic bollards have been         
 installed tnd improved the position   
 but the issue remains a grievance.
