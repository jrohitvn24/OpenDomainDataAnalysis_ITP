		<content> Swaffham is a small market town in    
 West Norfolk.It is situated on the    
 crossing point of the A47 trunk road  
 and the A1065.                        
 The block is a contrast of rural      
 farmland and the town itself.         
 The town is situated around a large   
 Market Square, dominated by the Market
 Cross which is surmounted by the      
 figure of Ceres.The buildings around  
 the Square are mainly Georgian,       
 although there are both older and more
 recent examples.                      
 On the highest part of the town, just 
 off the Market Suare is the Fifteeth  
 Century Church of S.S. Peter &amp; Paul.  
 To the South of the Square there is a 
 mixture of residential, schools and   
 factories, giving way to open fields  
 and forests.
