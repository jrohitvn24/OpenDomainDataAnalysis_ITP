		<title>10Blean Bird Park</title>
		<content> In Blean Bird Park, started ten years 
 ago by the present owner is a         
 collection of birds mostly belonging  
 to the parrot family.                 
 On this twenty acre site are over six 
 hundred parrots, the largest          
 collection in Europe.  Some of these  
 are free-flying in the park.          
 The collection includes macaws,       
 cockatoos, parakeets, owls, soft      
 bills, peacocks and pheasants with an 
 emphasis on breeding pairs to help    
 those species in danger of            
 extinction.Some of the parrots talk to
 the visitors. The chestnut trees,many 
 of them very ancient are much         
 appreciated by the nesting            
 woodpeckers.                          
  The owner has recently had problems  
 with continuation of planning consent 
 for the Bird garden which is visited  
 by thousands of tourists each year.   </content>
