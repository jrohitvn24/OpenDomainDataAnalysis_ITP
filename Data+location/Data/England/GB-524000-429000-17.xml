		<title>17BURTON PIDSEA VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>  Plans for a prefabricated hall were  
 put before the people of Burton Pidsea
 in April, 1953 and construction began 
 in November of the same year.  The    
 Memorial Hall was opened on March     
 31st, 1954. In 1950, Mr. T. Harrison  
 had donated a piece of land, next to  
 the hall's proposed site, for use as a
 playing field.                        
 The Hall is very well used for a      
 variety of purposes. It provides the  
 premises for the Child Health Clinic  
 and Blood Donor Clinic. Sports'       
 Groups, Children's Groups and Clubs,  
 Church Groups and Farming and         
 Horticultural Societies are all       
 regular users of the Hall. It is also 
 open for social events. One of the    
 major events of the year is the       
 Carnival which takes place for the    
 sole purpose of raising funds for the 
 Memorial Hall and Playing Field.      </content>
