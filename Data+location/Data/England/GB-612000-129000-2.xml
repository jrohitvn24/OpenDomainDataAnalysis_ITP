		<title>02MY DYMCHURCH LIFE STYLE</title>
		<content> I live about 1 kilometre from the     
 village of Dymchurch. There are no    
 shops around me, with the exception of
 a farm which sells eggs and goats     
 milk, and a petrol station which sells
 sweets and garden supplies. At the    
 back of my house there is a dyke and a
 field, then the R.H.D.R. train track. 
 When I start at Southlands Secondary  
 School I will travel by the miniature 
 train. I am only about half a         
 kilometre away from the sea. I have   
 many friends living nearby.There is a 
 waste ground where we enjoy BMX       
 cycling,fishing and making camps. We  
 often go down to the sea to swim and  
 play with our dinghys in the pools. I 
 believe that I am very lucky to have  
 the beach and the countryside for my  
 leisure activities.
