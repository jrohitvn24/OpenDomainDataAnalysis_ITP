		<title>10INDUSTRY IN INKBERROW.</title>
		<content> There are not any factories in        
 Inkberrow,but many of the people make 
 things.Sometimes they make things at  
 home like cards made out of flowers.  
 The flowers are dried and pressed and 
 they have special sticky stuff over   
 the top.Some ladies sew things like   
 tea cosies,aprons and oven gloves and 
 other things for the kitchen.People   
 can go to shops in lots of other      
 places like Stratford-upon-Avon and   
 even London,and buy them.They look    
 like little cottages with material on 
 the roof to look like thatch.They even
 have flowers round the doors.The name 
 on the bag is THIMBLES of INKBERROW.  
 Some people do out work from factories
 in Alcester.There is a dairy on the   
 main road.Milk is delivered here from 
 Birmingham and then the family deliver
 it round Inkberrow and local villages.
