		<content> The following are impressions gained  
 from local residents about the way the
 village has altered over the past few 
 years.                                
                                       
 "The village has grown dramatically in
 the last ten years, although School   
 Lane has not changed much since the   
 war. Three ponds in the village have  
 been filled in. One was on Manor Farm 
 yard and is now a building site".     
                                       
 "Five or six lime trees were removed  
 from the main street and we think it  
 would be nice to replant some".       
                                       
 As a part of this survey we           
 interviewed one local resident who    
 gave us some detailed memories of the 
 village.     Continued on next page.
