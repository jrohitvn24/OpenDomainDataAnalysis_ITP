 115 acres of specimen trees which was 
 started by the late Sir Harold Hillier
 in 1953. At first 10 acres were       
 planted around Jermyns House, but when
 nursery operation moved away from an  
 adjoining area in 1961 the Arboretum  
 expanded yearly until it filled the   
 present site in 1979.                 
 In1976 the Arboretum was made into    
 a charitable trust to secure its long 
 term development.Responsibility for   
 the trust was accepted by Hampshire   
 County Council in 1977.               
 The Arboretum is open to the public at
 weekends and on Bank Holidays.        
 There is also a garden centre which is
 open throughout the year.
