		<title>19ONE BOY'S DAILY LIFE</title>
		<content>    I get up at 8:00a.m.get a wash and 
 brush my teeth.I then go into my      
 bedroom and get dressed.I go down     
 stairs and have my breakfast.Then     
 I get everything I need for school    
 and get my money from my mum and      
 set off for school. When I get to     
 school I play cricket and when the    
 bell goes I rush in and get my dinner 
 mark and start working. I go out to   
 play 3 times a day,early break time,  
 dinner break time and last break      
 time. When school has finished I go   
 home and have my tea and go out to    
 play until 9:00p.m.and have my supper 
 and watch television and go to bed    
 ready for the next morning.
