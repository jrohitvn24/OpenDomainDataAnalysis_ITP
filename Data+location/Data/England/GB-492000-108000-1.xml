		<content> The area contained within our block   
 consists mainly of woodland and       
 agricultural land. It is a hilly area,
 being mainly in the foothills of the  
 South Downs, with a beautiful rolling 
 landscape. The main agriculture is    
 concerned with livestock (sheep and   
 cattle) and cereal/grass production.  
 But it is the Beech Woods which are   
 its main attraction. These offer      
 beautiful walks and the opportunities 
 for studying wildlife.                
 The village of Eartham is in the      
 centre of the area and has a 12th     
 century church and a public house, The
 George Inn, which has a restaurant    
 attached. It is a typically 'Sussex'  
 village with many flint and brick     
 houses. It is mainly an agricultural  
 village with a population of less than
 100 people.
