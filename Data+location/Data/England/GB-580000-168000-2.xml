		<content> The area is predominantly covered by  
water and marshes but farming is a     
significant activity on almost all     
suitable land.On the Motney Hill       
peninsula the land, leased from the    
water authority, is mainly used for    
arable crops especially wheat and      
barley but a hay crop is taken from    
low-lying water meadows on the eastern 
side.South of the coastal road there is
a 1Km belt used mainly for tree        
crops,apples, pears, cherries with some
strawberries.North of the coast road   
extending to the sea wall there is     
rough graziing for a few sheep and     
horses.Farms are generally small and   
some of the land is in smallholdings   
producing fruit and vegetables for     
local consumption. Almost all this land
is classified Grade 1 by the Ministry. 
The emphasis on horticultural crops is 
typical of much of North West Kent.    </content>
