		<content> The study area is a plateau at around 
 700' above sea level near the crest of
 the Cotswolds.  It slopes gently from 
 west to east and is etched by the     
 valleys of several small streams, of  
 which the most important drains a     
 network of valleys to the N.E. towards
 the River Frome at Stroud. The plateau
 surface is formed of Tresham Rock,    
 part of the Great Oolite.  It is dry  
 open scenery  interupted only by dry  
 stone walls and occasional copses.    
 The deeper valleys reach down into the
 Cotteswold Sand.  Much of the valley  
 side land below 600' is affected by   
 landslips caused by periglacial       
 conditions during the ice age.  The   
 valley sides provide variety with     
 larger fingers of woodland and the    
 scenery justifies its inclusion in the
 Cotswold "Area of Outstanding Natural 
 Beauty".                              </content>
