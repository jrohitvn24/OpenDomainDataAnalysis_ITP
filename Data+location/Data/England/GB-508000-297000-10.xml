		<content>  Stibbington Field Studies Centre is  
 owned by Cambridgeshire County Council
 and is a centre for county schools to 
 use for both residential and day      
 visits.  The centre contains bedrooms,
 dining and social areas as well as    
 classroom facilities.                 
  Most of the Centre's visitors are    
 from the Peterborough area.  Every    
 year more than one thousand children  
 stay at the Centre and a further      
 thousand come for day visits.         
  The Centre's courses are mainly      
 concerned with Environmental Studies, 
 but there are also courses in Biology,
 Geography, History, Outdoor Pursuits, 
 Conservation, Photography, Video      
 and Art.  Most of the places used for 
 study are within easy walking distance
 of the Centre.
