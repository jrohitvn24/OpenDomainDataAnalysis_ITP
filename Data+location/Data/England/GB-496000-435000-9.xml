		<content>  ABOUT 92% OF OUR AREA IS PRODUCTIVE  
 FARMLAND,4% WOODS AND PARKLAND USED AS
 PHEASANT SHOOTS,THE OTHER 4% BEING THE
 VILLAGE.                              
  THE LAND TO THE EAST IS HEAVY CLAY   
 LOAM RISING THROUGH A MEDIUM LOAM TO A
 SILTY CLAY LOAM,WITH FLINTS,ON THE    
 HIGHER WOLD.NEAR THE VILLAGE THE CHALK
 IS 16ft BELOW THE SURFACE SO HEAVY    
 LAND IS DRAINED.MANY FARMS HAVE UNUSED
 WELLS AND OLD PONDS,ALL NOW USE MAINS 
 WATER OFTEN EVEN LED TO THE FIELDS.   
  THERE IS LITTLE VANDALISM,BUT SOME   
 TRESPASS AND PEOPLE DISTURBING ANIMALS
 WHILE WALKING THEIR DOGS.             
  ONE FARM ISN'T WORKED BY THE RESIDING
 FAMILY,THIS IS PART OF A COMPANY AND  
 WORKED FROM ANOTHER FARM.2 OTHER FARMS
 ARE WORKED AS ONE UNIT BY BROTHERS.   
  THE FARMS AVERAGE 290 ACRES,WITH 26.5
 ACRE AVERAGE FIELDS,1 MAN TO 109 ACRES
 AND 1 TRACTOR TO EVERY 96.6 ACRES.    </content>
