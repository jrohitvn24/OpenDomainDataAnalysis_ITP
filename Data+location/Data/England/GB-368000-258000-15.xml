		<title>15TRANSPORT AT TEDSTONE</title>
		<content> There are two roads in this area, one 
 south to north from Whitbourne Ford   
 to Clifton-upon-Teme and the other    
 south to west from Whitbourne to      
 Tedstone Wafre. The rest of the area  
 is served by farm tracks, drive       
 entrances etc. In a severe winter     
 these roads are liable to be          
 completely blocked by heavy snowfalls.
 There is no railway line and only one 
 bus a week services the area except   
 that two school buses take secondary  
 school children to Bromyard and       
 Worcester City. The main forms of     
 transport are private cars, tractors  
 and farm machinery.
