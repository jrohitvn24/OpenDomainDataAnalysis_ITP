		<title>06      POLLUTION</title>
		<content>{Pollution}is chemicals, rubbish, waste
 etc. Rubbish and waste is usually     
 found in rivers, streams and marshes. 
{Chemicals}are found in the air and the
 main contributor in this area is the  
 coalite which pumps loads of coal dust
 and chemicals into the air every day. 
 Another very big cause of air         
 pollution is the{exhaust fumes}from   
 cars, buses, lorries and other land   
 vehicles.                             
         About sixty years ago         
{pollution}was very rare unlike today  
 when it is very common. We went on a  
 walk on the 26th June 1985 and found  
 out that{87%}of all the streams and   
 rivers we saw were polluted and only  
 13% were not polluted. We found       
 plastic bottles, rubber tyres, tin    
 cans, a bucket and glass bottles in   
 just one stream.
