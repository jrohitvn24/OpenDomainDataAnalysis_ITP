{Authority}remains that which was      
 established by the{1944 Education Act 
 which stresses selection at ll+.      
 There are two boys Grammar Schools in 
 this Survey area;{Altrincham Grammar  
{School}opened in l9l2 and St. Ambrose 
 College, a Roman Catholic foundation  
 of the Christian Brothers. Both of    
 these schools have close links with   
 the many{Preparatory Schools}which are
 so important to the area. Altrincham  
 Grammar School for boys boasts        
 excellent sports facilities, which    
 include five rugby pitches and the    
 survey team from our{Secondary Modern 
 school were also impressed with the   
 science labs. In l985 a scheme of     
 reorganisation was announced by the   
 Authority and it is proposed to merge 
 the Girls Grammar onto this site: is  
 this the reason for the re_decoration?</content>
