		<title>08Biography Mr White a farmer</title>
		<content> Mr. White will have lived on his farm 
 for 47 years in January 1986. We found
 out that the farmhouse floor, which   
 was laid when he moved in, is made of 
 animal knuckle bones. The name of his 
 farm is Cornshay Farm. Although he is 
 now retired he has still got one      
 tractor and all the bailing equipment 
 except for a bailer which he used to  
 borrow when he needed it. The farm    
 house has moose's antlers over the    
 entrance.
