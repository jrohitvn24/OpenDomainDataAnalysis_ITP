		<content>       {Kenton family                  
  It is very difficult to select one   
 family as each family does something  
 different. Our selected family has two
 children at our school. They have     
 lived in Kenton about ten years. The  
 father's work takes him all over the  
 South West and Kenton is close to the 
 motorways and main roads which helps  
 him to go about his work. The mother  
 is a nurse and is the local midwife   
 for the district. She delivers babies 
 in Kenton and three other villages.   
 Both adults said "we wanted to live   
 in a village and be part of it so we  
 moved to Kenton."All the family belong
 to local clubs.They all say they enjoy
 living here.
