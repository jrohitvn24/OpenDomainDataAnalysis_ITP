		<title>14 The New A45 Bypass</title>
		<content>                                       
 The A45 Bypass opened in November     
1980  was intended to take heavy       
traffic away from the village of Earls 
Barton,Great Doddington and Wilby. The 
villagers of Earls Barton are          
thankful and relieved that the new     
road skirting the housing estates of   
the village has taken traffic away     
from the village centre through which  
it is now quieter and safer to walk.   
However the link road is very busy and 
noisy particularly from large          
container lorries early in the         
morning. In Doddington the farmers are 
concerned that they have lost good     
agricultural land even though those    
who lost land were compensated. All    
the villagers are happy now that the   
village road is quieter.
