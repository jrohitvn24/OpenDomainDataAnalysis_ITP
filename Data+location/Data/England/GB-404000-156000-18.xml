		<title>18A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> we are going to do in the morning and 
 then it is soon time for assembly.At  
 lunchtime some people have school     
 dinners and some eat a packed lunch in
 Mr.Jenkins room.I have a packed lunch 
 in the hall and chat with the people  
 on my table.After lunch we are set new
 work and finish off the rest of our   
 work.At half past three we go home.I  
 go home and watch television until    
 five o'clock.At five we have tea which
 is usually sausages and mash.At a     
 quarter to six I get changed for      
 Cubs.I am a sixer in the Red six.We   
 play tig until 6 o'clock and then     
 Akela calls"Pack,pack,pack!"We all go 
 into a circle and do the Grand        
 Howl.Then Fred of Baloo does the subs 
 which is 15p.We play games like       
 "Convoy" or "Catch football".At 7.30  
 we go home and I go to bed at 9.
