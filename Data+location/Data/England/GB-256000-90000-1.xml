		<content> South of the valley of the West       
 Okehampton the land quickly gains     
 height, rising to the high ground of  
 northern Dartmoor. The lowest part of 
 this area near Meldon is about 200m.  
 above sea level, while Yes Tor stands 
 at 619m., only 2m below Dartmoor's    
 highest point, High Willhays. Most of 
 the area is wilderness country, only  
 the north-west edge being intruded    
 upon by farming, quarrying and water  
 catchment. The wild areas have a dual 
 use as rough grazing and army ranges, 
 Okehampton Camp being at the northern 
 edge of the area.                     
 Much of the area is relatively        
 inaccessible, with the road to Meldon 
 Dam and the military loop road the    
 only entry for vehicles. There is good
 walking as there are less bogs than   
 some parts of the moor. Sometimes the 
 area is closed by army firing.        </content>
