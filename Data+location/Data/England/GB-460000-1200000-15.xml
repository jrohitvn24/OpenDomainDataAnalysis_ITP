		<title>15Ponies in Uyeasound.</title>
		<content> Years ago there were horses in        
 Shetland but the horse ate so much    
 grass that there was not enough grass 
 for them.The Shetland ponies were so  
 small that they did not eat much      
 grass.Their coats grew thick to keep  
 them warm.                            
   Crofters and farmers keep Shetland  
 ponies for their enjoyment.Little     
 profit can be made from their sale.   
   I have two Shetland ponies.One of   
 my them is called Kizzy and the other 
 is called Shandy.Kizzy is chestnut and
 Shandy is brown and white.I keep them 
 in a field.I put water in a baby's    
 bath.They need water every day.I try  
 to groom them every day in Summer     
 too.Kizzy is five years old and Shandy
 is three years old.
