  Morrison's is a hypermarket.It has a 
 car park with 440 spaces,8 for        
 disabled people.There are 5 petrol    
 pumps.Inside,there are other shops    
 like a chemist,baker,wine shop as well
 as the big store itself.It sells      
 mostly food but also gardening things 
 and stationery,electric appliances    
 etc.The most expensive single item is 
 a colour TV which was Â£239.95.The     
 people who work in Morrisons mostly   
 work five days but they have different
 hours.When we went it was Wednesday   
 morning which is not very busy        
 compared with Fridays.We were         
 surprised tht more males were shopping
 than females.The majority were        
 local.People like Morrisons because it
 is easy to get to and everything is   
 under one roof.                       </content>
