		<title>15TEAM SPORTS IN BIBURY</title>
		<content> Bibury Football Team play at their    
 ground near Aldsworth Road.Games are  
 played on Saturdays but the clubhouse 
 is open some evenings.The team        
 originally consisted of players from  
 the parish but today only 6 come from 
 Bibury. The 1st x1 play in the Glos.  
 Northen Semior League and the 2nd x1  
 for the Cirencester League. Bibury    
 Cricket Club play most summer weekends
 on Ladyhill. The turf came from Bibury
 Race Course in 1929. The whole pitch  
 and pavilion were enclosed by a fence 
 in 1974 to protect it from the sheep. 
 Vehicle access was gained in 1985     
 after 16 years of parking on the old  
 football pitch. The clubs highlight in
 1981 was a game versus Warwickshire   
 led by Bob Willis,an England team     
 member, which included most of the    
 Warwickshire team.
