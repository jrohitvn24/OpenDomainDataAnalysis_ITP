		<content>   There are 40 people working in the  
 Swanage Health Centre. There are:     
 6 doctors, 8 receptionists, 2 nurses, 
 2 chiropodists, 3 health visitors,    
 5 district nurses, 1 midwife,         
 1 community health clerk, 4 community 
 health nurses, 1 speech therapist,    
 1 social worker, 1 psychiatric nurse, 
 1 dentist, 1 dental nurse and         
 3 cleaners.                           
   The present building was built in   
 1982 and is made of red brick. There  
 are 8,500 people in Swanage and if you
 include the surrounding villages the  
 total population comes to 11,000.     
 However in the summer this increases  
 to over 50,000 and these people have  
 to be catered for in the Centre.      
   Pre-school children are injected at 
 the Health Centre. These injections   
 prevent: measles, polio, whooping     
 cough and diptheria.                  </content>
