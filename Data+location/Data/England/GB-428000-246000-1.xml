		<content>     Our area is an agricultural area  
 with mainly arable farming .It is     
 situated in south of Warwickshire and 
 is part of the area which in earlier  
 times was called The Feldon.It still  
 reflects this description although    
 there are still very limited wooded   
 areas.                                
       We have three residential area  
 those of Pillerton Hersey,Pillerton   
 Priors and Fulready.Although farming  
 the area very few of the population is
 involved in the industry.             
      The population is divided between
 the retired and those whose           
 occupation take them away from the    
 villages during the day .Pillerton    
 Priors in particular could be         
 described as a dormitory for the      
 surrounding towns.
