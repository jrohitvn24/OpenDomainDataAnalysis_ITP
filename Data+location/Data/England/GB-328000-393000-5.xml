		<title>05THE "DIPS" AT NEW BRIGHTON</title>
		<content> On summer days the Dips on King's     
 Parade are full of people - though    
 they never seem crowded.              
 If there is a breeze, stunt-kites     
 whirl in fantastic loops and dive over
 games of cricket and football and     
 multi-coloured tents spring up to     
 complete the holiday picture.         
 In winter the Dips are very           
 different. They are bleak and         
 windswept with few people to be seen. 
 Sometimes strong winds and high tides 
 combine to produce towering waves     
 which thunder against and over the    
 sea-wall, flooding the summer         
 playgrounds which become mini         
 marine-lakes.                         
 It is to be hoped that the new sea    
 defences, financed by the E.E.C.      
 and complete this year, will prevent  
 flooding of the Dips in the future.
