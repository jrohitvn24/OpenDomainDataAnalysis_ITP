		<title>07BOATING IN LERRYN</title>
		<content>      Adjacent to the river in{Lerryn  
 there is a village green and a car    
 park. This makes it a very popular    
 spot for picnicers and people who wish
 to launch small boats, when the tide  
 allows. Groups of disabled visitors   
 come from{Churchtown Farm field centre
 at{Lanlivery,}as it is easy to move   
 disabled adults and children from     
 their mini-buses into their boats.    
      Several boats have their moorings
 at{Lerryn,}but they can only be used  
 for two hours either side of high     
 water, for the rest of the time they  
 are stranded on the mud. Boat owners  
 often take their boats down river on  
 one tide and bring them back on the   
 next.                                 
      Visitors should note that at high
 water, on spring tides, the roads next
 to the river in{Lerryn and Golant}and 
 the car park in{Lerryn}flood!         </content>
