		<content> In the block are about 20 farms       
 ranging from 3 acres to 600+ acres.   
 The smallest is a specialised poultry 
 unit growing no crops and is atypical.
 Otherwise the area is divided roughly 
 55/45 between grassland &amp; arable. 60% 
 of the farms have a dairy herd as the 
 main source of income, generally      
 supported by livestock rearing(beef &amp;/
 or sheep). Mostly, grain &amp; grass are  
 grown for fodder. All farms are of a  
 similar mixed pattern, the various    
 enterprises being so interdependent   
 that it is not possible to say which  
 is the main one. 60% of the farms are 
 owner occupied. Most of the rest are  
 rented from the Burwarton Estate. 50% 
 have been in the same family for more 
 than one generation, &amp; of the rest    
 several will be passed to sons who are
 already working on the farms. 80% of  
 workers are the farmer's own family.  </content>
