		<content> COPPICED HAZEL IS PREDOMINANT AND     
 ALMOST AS COMMON IS SILVER BIRCH.     
 ALDERS ARE GROWING NEAR THE STREAM    
 WHICH FLOWS THROUGH THE WOOD. IT IS   
 SLOW, CONTAINING CLAY AND STONES, AND 
 FAIRLY SHALLOW. MANY CHESTNUTS HAVE   
 HONEY SUCKLE CLIMBING OVER THE TRUNKS.
 SOME ELDER AND THE OCCASIONAL ASH, OAK
 AND BEECH CAN BE SEEN. BRACKEN, FERN  
 AND BLUEBELL SEED PODS ARE SCATTERED  
 ON THE FLOOR AND THERE IS AN          
 OCCASIONAL COMMON SPOTTED ORCHID.     
 SPEEDWELL, YELLOW PIMPERNEL, STINGING 
 NETTLE AND MOSSES ARE IN A GROUP      
 TOGETHER NEAR THE MANY BURROWS OF THE 
 RABBITS. ALSO NEARER THE STREAM IS    
 GROUND ELDER. OTHER PLANTS ARE BUGLE, 
 BUTTERCUP, DEAD NETTLE AND HAWTHORN.  
 SCRAPED BARK ON THE GROUND GIVES      
 EVIDENCE OF SQUIRRELS AND WE SEE LACE 
 WING, SPIDERS, WOODLICE, BEETLES,     
 BUTTERFLIES, FLIES AND SLUGS.         </content>
