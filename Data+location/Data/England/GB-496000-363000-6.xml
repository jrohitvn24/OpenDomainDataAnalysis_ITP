		<title>06CHILDREN IN WADDINGTON</title>
		<content>   Although Waddington is surrounded   
 by countryside it is nearly all       
 farmland and there is nowhere in the  
 countryside that children can play.   
 In upper Waddington there is a small  
 playground with swings, a slide and a 
 "witch's hat" and in lower Waddington 
 there is a small playground in the    
 corner of a sports field but these are
 usually broken. Apart from these there
 are only the public playing fields    
 where children can play safely.       
   A group of typical 10 and 11 year-  
 old children spend their spare time   
 riding bikes or roller skating in the 
 streets, playing football, collecting 
 coins or writing  stories. They attend
 guides, netball, tennis, swimming     
 clubs and play at the Astro Club but  
 most of them think the youth clubs    
 in both upper and lower Waddington    
 mainly cater for the older children.  </content>
