		<content> Catts Place, Paddock Wood             
 This property was mentioned in the    
 original Domesday Book                
 Catts place was given to one Hugo de  
 Catt by one of the monarchs, and is   
 still in the ownership of descendants 
 of the original family on the distaff 
 side.                                 
 The house has not really been altered 
 much although bathrooms have been     
 added                                 
 There is about 16 acres of land with  
 the house                             
 Wayside Cottage                       
 Originally a farm cottage dating from 
 1700 but has been added to and        
 modernised over the years and now has 
 a Granny Annexe                       
 It stands in 3 acres of land
