		<title>18Shopping in Alrewas &amp; Barton</title>
		<content>There are no shops in Wychnor, but     
Alrewas has a variety of shops along   
Main Street.  Food can be bought at the
Post Office, Dickenson's Stores, the   
Co-op, the Tudor Bread &amp; Cake shop or  
Coates the butcher.   There is a       
Nu-mark Pharmacy, a fish and chip      
shop, a newsagents, a bank and an      
antique shop.  People tend to shop     
in one of the nearby large towns'      
supermarkets and only buy locally if   
necessary.  Older people and women at  
home are the main customers. Main      
Street is much quieter now since a     
by-pass was opened in 1984.            
The shopping area in Barton is a small 
housing estate service.  There is a    
newsagent, a grocer, a discount        
hardware store, a hairdresser and a    
Chinese take away.  The main shops are 
elsewhere in the village and are       
changing quickly.                      </content>
