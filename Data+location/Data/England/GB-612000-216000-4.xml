 Tang Hall is a home for the elderly.  
 Before it was this it was a blind     
 home.These people started the buisness
 9 months ago.In Tang Hall their are 12
 old people.The oldest person is 85 and
 the youngest person is 60.Most of the 
 people come from London and East      
 Anglia.Mr Leivesley has 8 people      
 working for him,and they come to work 
 at 8.00 in the morning.He does all the
 decorating and the gardening and it   
 looks very nice from the outside.There
 are 9 bedrooms but some people share  
 because the bedrooms are very big.They
 also take the people for rides in the 
 van and the workers take them for     
 daily walks.
