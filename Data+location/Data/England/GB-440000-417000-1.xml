		<content> The area covered by our D-block is    
 one of considerable contrasts. At one 
 end stands{Nostell Priory,}an elegant 
 eighteenth century country house set  
 in beautiful grounds. At the other end
 of the areas the predominantly mining 
 community of Purston Jaglin           
 Featherstone, characterised by rows of
 uniform houses and typical of many    
 mining towns in our region.           
   Between these extremes lie acres of 
 farmland amongst which are found      
 quiet hamlets such as West Hardwick   
 and Hessle.                           
   The pit head at Ackton Hall         
 Colliery, jutting incongruously up    
 from the surrounding expanse of fields
 and agricultural land, presents a     
 strange but not untypical feature of  
 this region.
