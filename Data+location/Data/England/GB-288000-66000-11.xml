		<title>11LIFE IN COFFINSWELL</title>
		<content> The population has changed a lot over 
 the past few years. Years ago there   
 was a school and the cottage called   
 Appledoor was a shop.Now there is no  
 demand for them because children are  
 educated in Newton Abbot and people   
 shop at "Tesco Super Store"in         
 Kingsteignton.Business people living  
 in the village work in Newton         
 Abbot.People of Coffinswell are middle
 class citizens compared with the      
 people of Kingskerswell.The land      
 surrounding Coffinswell is rented or  
 owned by people who live in the       
 area.The area is not the sort of place
 where tourists would go out on the    
 town and buy sticks of rock.Anyone    
 visiting the area would go in for     
 things like horse riding or walking   
 The area in &amp; around Coffinswell is   
 picturesque,quiet &amp; pleasant.
