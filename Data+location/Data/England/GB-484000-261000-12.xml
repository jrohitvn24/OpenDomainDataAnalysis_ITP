		<content>The Factories of Messrs Barker.        
The name Barker means : one who        
collects oak bark for use in the       
process of tanning leather.            
The first known factory belonging to   
the Barker family was in London End. A 
Photograph exists showing the factory  
and its workers in circa 1890.From this
site the company moved to premises in  
Station Road.This new factory was built
in 1880 and soon the original works was
sold (c.1900).After several            
developments to the Station Rd site, a 
vast new factory was begun to          
accommodate all shoe making processes  
under one roof.                        
  The scale of the building has shaken 
many villagers as the proposed factory 
has grown.It can be seen from all      
directions but on balance is accepted  
by the majority as employment prospects
are enhanced.                          </content>
