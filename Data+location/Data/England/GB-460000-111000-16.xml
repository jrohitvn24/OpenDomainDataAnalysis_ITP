		<title>16LIVING IN THE NEWTOWN AREA</title>
		<content> Advantages: Most people mention love  
 of the countryside, its beauty, peace 
 and cleanliness. The community spirit 
 and friendliness are also important   
 factors. Some families mention the    
 school with its small classes and     
 others the closeness to large towns   
 with their amenities, the motorway,   
 the sea and the continent.            
 Disadvantages: The main concern was   
 lack of amenities (entertainment,sport
 etc.) and the high cost involved in   
 visiting them. Secondly the lack of   
 mains drainage and the irony that if  
 it was laid then the area might well  
 be developed to an undesirable extent.
 The biggest single issues are lack of 
 public transport and the lack of speed
 restrictions on Newtown's through     
 road.                                 
 Most people are concerned that the    
 village life should remain unchanged. </content>
