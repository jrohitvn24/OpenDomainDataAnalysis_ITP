		<content> Four burglars broke into our school a 
 few nights ago. They tried to get in  
 with crowbars and did a lot of damage 
 to many of the doors. The police said 
 there were three men and one woman.   
 They stole a casette recorder and a   
 good deal of food from the kitchen but
 they did not touch the television set 
 or the computer. They cut up our cooks
 sandals which was particularly        
 vicious. I don't like being in school 
 knowing that robbers were here it sort
 of gives me the creeps. The police    
 came and checked the school for       
 fingerprints. They took Mr Corbey's   
 fingerprints but I don't think they   
 suspect him because he's our a        
 Headmaster and he seems to be an      
 honest sort of chap. They were seen   
 leaving the school in the early hours 
 of the morning by the butcher but the 
 police haven't caught them yet.       </content>
