 With the development of the area as a 
 'tourist resort',an information centre
 was opened by the National Park's at  
 Ingram.Here they have booklets on this
 and other areas of                    
 Northumberland.There are also several 
 displays of things such as            
 landscapes,animal skulls,animal       
 footprints,wild animals and the valley
  in ancient times.You can also buy the
 usual souvenirs.Opposite the centre is
 St Michael's Church.There is a small  
 car-park.                             
      The information centre is        
 attached to what was the wardens house
 .There are now plans to move the      
 centre closer to the road which serves
 the valley.This move is at present    
 being opposed by the locals.
