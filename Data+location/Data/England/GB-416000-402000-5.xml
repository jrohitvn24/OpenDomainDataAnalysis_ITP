		<content> Early in this century in this area    
 there were three schools to teach     
 children throughout their school lives
 unless pupils had the good fortune to 
 go to Penistone Grammar School.       
 Dunford{Hazlehead School}was opened in
 November 1900 with 27 pupils and 2    
 teachers. There was a school at both{ 
{Carlecotes}and{Townhead.}By 1902 there
 were 83 children on roll as the result
 of Carlecotes school closing and 48   
 children been transferred. Until 1952 
 it was an "all age" school at which   
 time children over 11 years of age    
 were transferred to Thurlstone. From  
 1957 these children went to{Penistone 
{Grammer School}which had become a     
 Comprehensive school. In 1963 Townhead
 school closed and transferred children
 brought the roll to 83 rising briefly 
 in the mid 1970's to about 120. In    
 1985 there are now 48 children.       </content>
