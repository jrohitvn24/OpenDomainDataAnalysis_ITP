		<title>09A day in my life by James L</title>
		<content>   I awake at five past eight every    
 morning.I have a wash,get dressed and 
 have my breakfast.Then I clean my     
 teeth,comb my hair,put my lunch into  
 my bag and go to school.              
   When I get to school,I go in or I   
 play football.When the whistle goes,we
 line up.If we are the first line      
 ready we get a House Point.When I     
 get in I take off my coat and go into 
 the classroom.                        
   After I have done my work,the bell  
 rings and we go out to play.When we   
 come back from play we do some        
 maths,then have dinner.               
   In the afternoon we might have art, 
 P.E. or other work.Sometimes we have a
 fourth year meeting and then we go    
 home.                                 
   There are 5 pubs in Halling.I live  
 in a pub so I don't get much sleep.
