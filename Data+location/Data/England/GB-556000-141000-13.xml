		<title>13LIFE IN A RIDING SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   The stable owner arrives at 6.30am. 
She feeds, waters and mucks out the    
stabled horses.Sometimes she puts the  
horses into a field.She sweeps the yard
and at 8.00am friends sometimes come   
round to help.If they do they get out  
the school horses from the field.      
People pay to learn how to ride.The    
first rides begin at 9.00am and finish 
at 2.00pm.The horses are taken back to 
the field.The stable owner then sweeps 
out the yard and the stables.At about  
3.30pm the friends leave and at about  
5.30pm the stable owner checks all the 
horses and then goes home.Later on in  
the evening she comes back to check    
all the horses again.                  
    It is mostly girls who like to go  
horse-riding.Most instructors take     
their pupils out in the country lanes  
where they ride their horses.Those who 
have just started ride in a paddock.   </content>
