		<content> The{doctor's surgery}is in Bell       
 Street.There are four doctors who     
 regularly work there.If you are       
 ill,you phone up to make an           
 appointment to see the doctor.He will 
 have a look at you and may give you a 
 prescription which you take to one of 
 the two chemists to get your          
 medicine.If you are seriously ill,he  
 might send you to{hospital}at Harlow  
 or Bishop's Stortford,and if necessary
 you will be kept there until you are  
 better.In the same grounds as the     
 surgery there is a clinic where old   
 people and young children are         
 treated.In attendance there are       
 doctors and health visitors and       
 sometimes a chiropodist.Next door     
 there is a kitchen where "Meals on    
 Wheels" are cooked for old people.Two 
 dentists share the same surgery in the
 square.                               </content>
