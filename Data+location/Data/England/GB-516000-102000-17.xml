		<content> We carried out a survey on leisure and
 recreation in four classes acoss the  
 age groups in our shcool.Both adults  
 and children were asked to send       
 returns.After one week we carried out 
 an analysis of the replies.We gained a
 certain amount of information about   
 the activitys that people do in their 
 spare time.We found the most popular  
 activity was watching  television for 
 adults and children.The least popular 
 was volleyball for children and       
 adults.Our survey included spectator  
 sports as well,for adults snooker was 
 the most popular,football was the most
 popular for children.The most unusual 
 leisure activity was subaqua diving , 
 this is where you swim underwater with
 a mask,aqualung and flippers.
