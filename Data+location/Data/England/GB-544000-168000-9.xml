		<content>Tillingbourne Green is in the middle of
a large housing estate.It is not far   
from Orpington or Bromley.The Green has
its own parade of shops which serve the
local community.The shops around The   
Green include a post office and        
hardware store,a chinese take-away,a   
firm that sells water softeners,a      
greengrocers,a small supermarket,a     
hairdressers and a newsagent.If there  
were a bakery and a chemist it would   
help to meet the needs of the          
community.St.Mary Cray station is      
nearby and the railway line runs       
through the estate.It is a main line to
Victoria Station in London.            
The Green is used as a play area.It    
has a few claims to fame.Lady Silkin   
and Ted Willis used to live in Amherst 
Drive,one of the first roads to be     
built.Also,the Red Devils parachute    
team has landed on The Green.          </content>
