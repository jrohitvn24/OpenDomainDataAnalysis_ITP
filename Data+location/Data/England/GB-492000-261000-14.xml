		<title>14Santa Pod</title>
		<content>   About forty-five years ago there was
 a war on and Santa Pod was an         
 airfield.  Now the airfield is used as
 a drag racing strip.  The strip is a  
 quarter of a mile long.  When it is   
 hot they need to put water on the     
 track so that the rubber does not     
 burn.                                 
   My Grandad owns the airfield.  He   
 lives in a bungalow.  Some of the     
 things from the war you can still see.
 You can see some old air-raid shelters
 and huts.  My Dad rents some of the   
 buildings.  You can see a painting of 
 a bomber in one of the buildings.
