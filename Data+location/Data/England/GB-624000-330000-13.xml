		<title>13ROADS NEAR OUR SHOOL</title>
		<content> We found that there was one bus on    
 Saturday going to North Walsham from  
 Aylsham.It costs 63p.The bus services 
 have been cut such alot that most     
 people have cars,or have to rely on   
 friends and the community bus if they 
 live in the villages .Most of the     
 children in our school go to school on
 a coach.There are lots of coach firms 
 which run buses to larger places for  
 shopping etc.                         
 The B1145 is a very busy road near our
 school.Lots of people go to work at   
 the towns.In January,it snowed so much
 that this road was blocked and we had 
 a day off school.                     
 This road goes through part of        
 Banningham,and right through          
 Felmingham which is where lots of     
 children from our school live.It is a 
 long village,built along the road.
