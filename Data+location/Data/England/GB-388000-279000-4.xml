		<content>   At this time,Hagley had no post     
 office.Letters were brought by a      
 postwoman from Stourbridge,and twice a
 week,a carrier took parcels and       
 passengers to Birmingham.             
   Most original Hagley houses stood   
 near the crossing of the road linking 
 Stourbridge and Bromsgrove to         
 Halesowen. No road from the{Forge     
{Garage}to the main A458 roundabout    
 existed.The garage was then the site  
 of a blacksmith's shop,and next to it 
 was a{cattle market}which usually     
 opened on Mondays. As the Stourbridge 
 road neared the market,one turned left
 to Halesowen,or straight on to        
 Kidderminster, via the{Lyttelton      
{Arms.}At this junction was a drinking 
 fountain, which was moved in 1929 to a
 piece of waste ground opposite the    
 traffic island,near to the{War
