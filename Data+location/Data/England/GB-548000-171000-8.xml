		<title>08Social Survey</title>
		<content>   On Tuesday 11th June we went to the 
 'Grove' in Footscray to do our social 
 survey of the local area. We were     
 split into 3 groups. We asked 20      
 questions to 50 householders. It was a
 weekday, so many people we asked were 
 retired. Most people we asked had     
 lived in their houses for over 20 yrs 
 &amp; everyone owned their house except   
 1. Nearly all the houses had 3-4      
 bedrooms. The men had skilled jobs and
 didn't work locally. Out of 50 people 
 only 4 didn't have a car. Most people 
 thought that their social amenities   
 were poor &amp; schools good. To the      
 political question, most people       
 answered that they voted Conservative.
 Nearly everyone used the Footscray    
 Meadows for walking. Most of the      
 people thought the roads poorly.      
 We can conclude that people here are  
 well off, well educated Conservatives.</content>
