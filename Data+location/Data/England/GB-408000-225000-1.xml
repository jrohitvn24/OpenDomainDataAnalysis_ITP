		<content> Our 'D' block covers the hamlets of   
 Barton,Kineton,Castlett and Bemborough
 as well as part of the villages of    
 Temple Guiting and Guiting Power. As  
 we are part of the North Cotswolds we 
 have many hills,rivers and woodlands. 
 The River Windrush rises just to the  
 north of the block and flows into the 
 Thames near Oxford. The land is mainly
 arable land although there are several
 flocks of sheep,tree plantations and  
 herds of bullocks. Most buildings are 
 made of local stone with slate roofs  
 and houses have large gardens. Many   
 people take coach tours of the area   
 and the local inns cater for the      
 visiting driver.                      
 Most of the young children go to      
 Temple Guiting School whilst those    
 over 11 years go to either Westwood's 
 Grammar School or Bourton Vale        
 Secondary School.                     </content>
