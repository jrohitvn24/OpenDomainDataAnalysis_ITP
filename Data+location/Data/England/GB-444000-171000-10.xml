		<title>10BARLEY MALTING</title>
		<content> On the larger farm an old tythe barn  
 has been adapted to fit the needs     
 of a modern farm by a corrugated iron 
 addition and the installation of a    
 drier. Before the grain can be stored 
 it is dropped into a pit,goes through 
 a pre-cleaner that gets rid of large  
 and small refuse,then goes on either  
 to a final cleaner or through the     
 drier.This can handle 7 tonnes an     
 hour.The crop has to be harvested in  
 good condition and a critical         
 temperature of 13 degrees centigrade  
 must be maintained for barley         
 otherwise malting will fail.Inside the
 barn there are 4 separate sections 3  
 used for storage and 1 for machinery. 
 Storage is important because this     
 farmer holds grain until he can get   
 the best price.Modern additions to the
 old timber structure have caused      
 problems.                             </content>
