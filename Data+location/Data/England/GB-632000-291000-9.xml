		<title>09Unemployment in Ditchingham</title>
		<content>  With manual workers now probably less
 than half the total labour force &amp;    
 automation affecting manufacturing    
 industries there seems little         
 likelihood of a drop from 11% of those
 now unemployed.IN Ditchingham young   
 people have been the worst affected.  
 On the Windmill Green estate (30      
 council houses) there are atleast 4   
 younster of 18,19 years without jobs. 
 One girl having followed a manpower   
 services course at Lowestoft full time
 for 12 months then worked at a chicken
 factory for eight weeks,an old peoples
 home for 4 months, was made redundant 
 &amp; has had no job since. She is now    
 nineteen &amp; though not unintelligent   
 singularly lacking in motivation.There
 has been a steady shift from manufact 
 uring to service industries,so perhaps
 it is in this area that young people  
 may see most hope for the future.     </content>
