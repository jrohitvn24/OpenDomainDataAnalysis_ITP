 Maggoty Johnson's Wood.Maggoty's Wood 
 was named after Mr. Samuel            
 Johnson.Samuel was a court jesyer at  
 Gawsworth Hall which still exists. In 
 the Hall Samuel was known as Lord     
 Flame.Samuel is buried in Maggoty's   
 Wood,which is why it is named after   
 him. He came to be buried there       
 because he said "I shall shoot an     
 arrow up into the air and where ever  
 it lands I shall be buried."          
 The wood is really called Maggoty     
 Johnson's Wood, but we call it more   
 often Maggoty's Wood.                 
 The wood is wned and maintained by the
 National Trust.
