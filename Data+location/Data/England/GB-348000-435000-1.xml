		<content>The area is occupied by dairy farms    
with some  small areas of housing.     
North-South road and rail routes pass  
through the eastern part of the area   
where most of the population lives.    
Other houses are scattered throughout  
the area which covers most of Barton   
and parts of Woodplumpton and Catforth.
                                       
Most changes have been gradual but two 
small developments of post war housing 
to the east of the main road through   
Barton have brought people to the      
area. A few other houses have been     
built or barns converted but few       
additional houses have been            
constructed in the last ten years.     
                                       
There is some employment on the local  
farms, market gardens, hotels and      
garden centre but many people travel   
about five  miles to work in Preston.  </content>
