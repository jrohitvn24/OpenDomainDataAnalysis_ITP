		<title>02FARMING AND LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> Most of the area that extends north of
 Luton is used for arable farming. The 
 section that we surveyed contain      
 roughly six farms covering an area of 
 approximately seven square kilometres.
 In this area there are two or three   
 villages and the farms tend to be     
 situated on the edge of the village.  
       The farm boundaries in the south
 extend right up to the Luton border   
 and this land is currently under      
 threat as the town grows northwards.  
 During the last ten years a           
 considerable amount of farming land   
 has been built upon and farms such as 
 Little Bramingham Farm have been      
 swallowed up by the growth of the     
 town.This process is likely to        
 continue over the next few years as   
 the town expands further northwards.
