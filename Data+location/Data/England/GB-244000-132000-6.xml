 She had her "jelly bean" shoes on,    
 they are quite fashionable but{Mr     
{Little}thinks they aren't very

 the steepest of the sand dunes and    
 turn around at the bottom and run back
 up again.{Jason Smith}set a new

  Towards the end of the walk we looked
 at an artificial pond, it didn't look 
 man made as it blended in with the    
 surrounding area. We saw lots of{     
{Dragonflies, Newts}and{Water Beetles.}

 further information, see pages 12_13).
