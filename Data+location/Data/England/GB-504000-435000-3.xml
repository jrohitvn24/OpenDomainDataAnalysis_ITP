		<content>     Away from the main road are {     
{Dunswell Lane}(going west to          
 Cottingham) and{Ings Lane}(going east 
 to thre River Hull).{Dunswell Lane}is 
 a mixture of old cottages and         
 recently-built bungalows, especially  
 near{Barmston Drain},a popular angling
 spot.{Ings Lane}nursery is actually a 
 garden centre, well used by visitors  
 from Hull.Further produce is supplied 
 by two farms within the village.      
     The local primary (4-11) is       
 Dunswell school (opened 1881) situated
 on the main road and next to the      
 public house,the Coach and Horses.    
 There are 59 children, three teachers 
 and a secretary in cramped buildings  
 with a small playground.  However the 
 few functions held in the village     
 occur at the {Institute}not far away.
