		<content>    Due to local factories extending   
 their depots it has resulted in the   
{squirrels}moving nearer Eastham Woods.
 There are,at present,150 grey         
 squirrels,although the harsh winter of
 1982 killed a large number of the     
 population.They are pests because they
 steal eggs from nests and they eat the
 bark off the trees.The wardens cannot 
 kill any of the squirrels because the 
 land is protected.                    
   {Partridges}and{hares}have now all  
 disappeared because they ate all the  
 scrub and vegetation.                 
    The{bat}population among others has
 increased during the last 10 years.   
 They live in the hollows of the trees.
 Bat boxes have been put up to increase
 the population of the pipestrelle bat.
    The white-letter Hairstreck        
{butterfly }has declined in numbers    
 because of the lack of elm leaves.    </content>
