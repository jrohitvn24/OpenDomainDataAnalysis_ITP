     The playgroup in Methwold is held 
 on Tuesday and Thursday mornings from 
 9.30 until 12.00 in the village hall. 
 It is run by a supervisor and two     
 mother helpers.                       
      On Tuesday 23 April we visited   
 the playgroup to talk to the parents  
 and children. There  were 9 children  
 at playgroup that morning, 8 children 
 lived in Methwold and 1 child lived in
 Whittington. 3 children liked playing 
 in the shop, 3 children liked playing 
 with the cars best,2 children liked   
 playing in the sand and 1 child liked 
 playing with the bricks. 5 children   
 were looking forward to going to      
 school but 4 were not.
