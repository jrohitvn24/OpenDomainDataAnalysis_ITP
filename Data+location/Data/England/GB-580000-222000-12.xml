		<content>{*}The hedge was approximately 4ft.    
 high,but had recently been cut by a   
 mechanical cutter as the top was very 
 rough and ragged.This section of the  
 hedge was made of hawthorn,elder and  
 hazel.At the bottom there were        
 nettles,grasses,clover and brambles.  
 When we looked at the surface of the  
 soil we found spiders,flies,ants and a
 beetle.We looked in the hedge for     
 nests without finding any.The hedge   
 faced east.If it had faced north,one  
 side would be shaded from the sun,so a
 different population of animals and   
 plants would live in it.              
{*}We used a method to decide the age  
 of the hedge devised by Dr.Max Hooper.
 For every proper species of tree in   
 the hedge it is reckoned to be 100    
 years old.                            
{*}We estimated the hedge to be 300    
 years old.                            </content>
