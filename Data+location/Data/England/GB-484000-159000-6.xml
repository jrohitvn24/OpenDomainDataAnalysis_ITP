		<title>06Entertainment in Camberley</title>
		<content> The{cinema}is on the outskirts of     
 Camberley. Inside it has been divided 
 into one large and two smaller        
 cinemas. It is also used as a bingo   
 hall.                                 
                                       
 We have a{Civic Hall,}which is used   
 for discos, plays and art exhibitions.
 It has a large car park next to it.   
                                       
 Night life in Camberley does not      
 amount to much, but there are two     
{disco type clubs,}one of which my     
 mother remembers dancing in when she  
 was a girl.                           
                                       
 Most of the young people go a few     
 miles away to Fleet, Frimley Green or 
 Bagshot where there are{Country Clubs.
                                       
 We also have an{arcade}of video games.
