		<title>15Lower Tadmarton Village (1)</title>
		<content>Lower Tadmarton is a little {hamlet} in
a valley. It has very few buildings,   
although it has an {agricultural       
factory} and 5 people are employed     
there. There  is a lovely {brook}      
running through the back of some       
gardens. It also runs through the back 
of a farm. It used to run through the  
middle of a field to a water wheel and 
so the farm is called Â£The Mill'.      
There is a public Bridleway through a  
field. There are lots of dry-stone     
walls. There is also a {dry-stone barn}
that is still in perfect condition.    
One of the houses that is   called     
Â£Rosegarth' is where one of the        
teachers from our school lives. Some   
of the houses are old and some are     
modern. You can see which are old      
because either they are made of        
{Hornton Stone}, or they have small    
windows, or they have a thatched roof. </content>
