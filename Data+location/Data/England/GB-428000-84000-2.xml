		<title>02DAY IN LIFE OF 9YR OLD</title>
		<content>  I wake up at about 6am,read for about
 an hour and a half,then I turn on the 
 radio,get up and get dressed.I play a 
 game or read until mum calls me for   
 breakfast.I nearly always have corn-  
 flakes and a piece  of toast,then I go
 upstairs and wash,and clean my teeth  
 and pack my bag.Then I go and call for
 Nicky to go to school.At school the   
 first thing we do is go to assembly   
 where we sing hymns and pray.When we  
 come back up we do maths or English.At
 10:30 we go out and you can buy       
 peanuts.When we come back in we carry 
 on with our work.At 12:00 we have     
 lunch and then we go out to play. When
 we come in we sing.We say our prayers 
 and then we go home.When I get home I 
 ride my bike,watch TV or play with    
 Nicky.At 6pm we have tea. After tea I 
 watch TV until 8pm when I go to bed.
