		<content> Nestled down by the quiet River       
 Stiffkey,Great Walsingham has a       
 population of 480.There has been a    
 post office for over 75 years.We also 
 have 2 churches,{St.Peters}and a{     
{Methodist Chapel}.There are three     
 farms in the village.I live next to   
 one.There is the stump of an old      
 windmill.We think there is the flint  
 base of an old watermill.There are the
 remains of the first flint            
 church.There are two village          
 greens,one has a lot of lovely        
 flowering cherry trees.On the other   
 outside{Berry Hall}grows a{Restoration
{oak}.Berry Hall was at one time a     
 partly fortified manor house.It used  
 to be moated.The ladies who run it    
 have a lot of foster children.Near the
 green with the cherry trees stands a  
 foundry.     by Neil Halls
