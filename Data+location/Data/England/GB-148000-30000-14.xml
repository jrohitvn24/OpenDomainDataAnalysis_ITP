		<content> British Airways operate the only      
 public{helicopter service}in the      
 country from just outside Penzance to 
 the{Isles of Scilly.}It takes 20      
 minutes to fly 27 passengers and their
 luggage about 40 miles to St.Mary's.  
 The Sikorsky helicopter, travelling at
 140 m.p.h., makes about 12 flights a  
 day and carries around 80,000         
 passengers a year. It uses 100 gallons
 of kerosene for one return journey. It
 is crewed by two pilots and a steward.
 The helicopter is manoevered to face  
 into the wind for vertical take-off.  
 Once airborne it is much noiser than  
 an aeroplane and there is a lot of    
 vibration. For economy, only one      
 helicopter is in use at a time and    
 maintenance staff work late hours and 
 Sundays to keep it in operation. A    
 return ticket costs about Â£27.
