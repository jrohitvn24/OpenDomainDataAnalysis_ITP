 beech,are 250 to 300 years old.a few  
 trees in the park have been pollarded 
 and many trees have been              
 coppiced.Pollarding is when half the  
 tree is cut down and several thin     
 branches sprout out.A coppiced tree   
 is cut right down and several thin    
 branches also sprout out.The warden   
 coppices some trees to give others    
 more room to grow.In the past the     
 branches were used for fencing and hop
 poles.
