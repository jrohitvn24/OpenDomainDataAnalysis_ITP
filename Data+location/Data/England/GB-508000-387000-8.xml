		<content> Traditionally, local industry has been
 largely concerned with providing      
 services for the surrounding          
 agricultural fraternity. This         
 continues with machinery distributors,
 suppliers of general farm requirements
 fencing etc. together with fertiliser,
 seed and feedstuffs stockists. The    
 major employer in the town is a       
 manufacturer of plastic boxes for a   
 variety of specialist uses- such as   
 first-aid cases. Other industries,    
 some on the District Council sponsored
 industrial site, are printing,        
 packaging, saddlery, deep-sea fishing 
 equipment, deep- freeze storage and a 
 number of road-haulage companies, some
 of which are one-man concerns. There  
 are a number of other 'service' in-   
 dustries including 7 motor engineers  
 and an area office of the Milk        
 Marketing Board.                      </content>
