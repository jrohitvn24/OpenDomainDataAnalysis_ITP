		<title>04PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>   We telephoned seven members of the  
{parish council.}We found out that they
 are choosing a new governor from      
 Frettenham  .                         
    They are going to permit building  
 on Spixworth mushroom farm.           
   All of them said it was a very      
 enjoyable.They work up to thirty hours
 a week or sometimes not even an hour  
 per day.                              
   The workings of the parish council  
 are that they plan everything,they can
 employ people and they make sure the  
 streets are clean .                   
   You have to live in the village     
 to be picked for the parish council   
 ; if one person retires from the      
 parish council then they pick a new   
 councillor.There are twelve people    
 on the parish council.
