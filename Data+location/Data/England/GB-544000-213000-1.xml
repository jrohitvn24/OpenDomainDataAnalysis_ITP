		<content>  The area includes many farms.        
 Hardings,Groves,Crumps and Actons     
 being but a few. Most of the area is  
 High Wych which used to be part of    
 Sawbridgeworth Parish (the name 'High 
 Wych means High Woodland). At the time
 of the Domesday book Sawbridgeworth   
 was held by Geoffrey de Mandeville.   
 Sawbridgeworth was inherited by the   
 de Sayes in 1186 (Sayes Park Farm     
 being all that remains of their       
 estate).The town of Sawbridgeworth is 
 only partially included in the        
 area.Sawbridgeworth is on the A1184   
 from London to Cambridge.Most of the  
 area is farmland but some of it is    
 being built on by developers like the 
 White Post Field/Highgate Grove       
 development.
