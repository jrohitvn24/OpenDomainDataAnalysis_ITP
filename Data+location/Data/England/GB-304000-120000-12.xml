		<content>             The Pub.                  
       The public house at Appley is   
 called The Globe. It is a very old    
 building and has been a pub for at    
 least a hundred years and has been in 
 the same family for much of that time.
       The Globe is the social centre  
 for the area and becomes quite busy in
 the evenings. There is a garden for   
 the children to play in.              
       Nearly every week skittles are  
 played in the pub's skittle alley     
 between different teams.              
               Fetes                   
       We hold a number of fetes each  
 year. The church fete this year was at
 Stawley Mill. There was a treasure    
 map,Pick a Straw, Spin the Wheel, a   
 bottle stall and a book stall. Mrs    
 Henson was selliong home made cakes.  
 There were trout in the river next to 
 the garden.                           </content>
