		<title>16Horses at Whitehouse Farm</title>
		<content>   Mrs. Jackson, a horse trainer at    
 Whitehouse Farm, has 9{thoroughbred   
{horses.} The fields are her father-in-
 law's.  Not all the horses are hers,  
 she just trains them.  Her father-in  
 law, also a trainer, shares a piece of
 land which they call "the gallop".    
   Her husband and daughter help run   
 the stables, with a stable boy.  Their
 only machinery is a horse lorry.      
   There is a set timetable: the horses
 are fed four times a day, on oats, a  
 few racing nuts and hay.  They are    
 exercised every day, mostly galloping 
 and over a few jumps.  There are 8    
 stables, but in non- season most of   
 the horses are turned out to grass and
 only 3 stables are used.              
   The house was rebuilt four years ago
 since it was falling down.  Mr.Jackson
 helps train, although he is in a wheel
 chair through a bad riding accident.  </content>
