The Little Chef Restaurant has been    
standing for 11 years by the busy      
A45 Newmarket By-pass. In the summer   
time the busiest day is Saturday and   
in the winter it is Wednesday. They    
start at 7.00am and finish at 10.00pm. 
Altogether they have 14 staff. The     
food comes from Pine and May and it is 
delivered 3 times a week. They have    
approximately 1500 customers a week.   
The site belongs to B.P garages. The   
name Little Chef was made up by a man  
called Lord Forte and it now belongs   
to the Trust House Forte group of      
hotels.
