		<content> The average acreage of farms in our   
 area is 223 on 5 farms.  These are    
 mixed farms and all but one(600 acres)
 were of less than average size for S. 
 Oxfordshire.  We visited the largest  
 farm and it has 467 acres of arable   
 land growing 339 acres of wheat and   
 128 acres of barley.  There are 120   
 head of beef cattle. A few geese and  
 chicken are kept.  From questionnaires
 to the five farmers we found a total  
 of 128 dairy cows and 144 beef cattle,
 while there are 541 acres of wheat and
 barley and 370 acres of grassland and 
 4 acres of woodland.  No vegetables or
 fruit were grown.  The average size of
 field was 17 acres. All farmers had   
 mains water, fences, hedges and trees.
 There were 18 barns, 1 silo, 11       
 tractors, 1 combine, 7 ploughs and
