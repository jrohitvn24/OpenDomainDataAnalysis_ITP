		<content> Sycamore farm is a small farm in the  
 village of{Helme}.It consists of 39   
 acres of good pasture land carrying   
 approximately 40 head of{beef}cattle. 
 No crops are grown other than hay     
 and silage for winter feed.The        
 stables are rented out for livery.    
                                       
 In{spring}, fertilizer is spread on   
 the land to ensure good crops of hay  
 and silage in the{summer}.In late     
 April, cattle are turned out into the 
 field.Two crops of silage are cut,one 
 in summer and one in{autumn.}         
 Muck-spreading, any ploughing and     
 reseeding are carried out. The cattle 
 are brought in for the{winter}months  
 and fed with silage and barley.All the
 hay made in the summer is sold,mainly 
 to livery stables.
