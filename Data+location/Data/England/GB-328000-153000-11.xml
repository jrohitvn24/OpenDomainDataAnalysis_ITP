		<title>11THE BREAN LEISURE CENTRE(2)</title>
		<content>   Other activities going on during the
  eek in the open arena include,an open
air market,Greyhound racing,Donkey     
Derby's and other events.              
   Inside the leisure centre is the    
farmers tavern.It has a bar and a      
dancefloor.It is well furnished.You can
buy food there as-well as drinks.There 
are also a couple of amusement         
machines.                              
   There is a small club for           
golfers.You can go into the club and   
bar if you are a member.We asked a few 
people what they thought of the centre.
   We asked people if they'd been to   
the leisure centre before.Most of them 
had.They also said it wasn't very      
crowded there,it was quiet,but there is
enough to do.The trade was quiet,not   
many there only weekenders.This was    
probably because the weather was       
bad.                                   </content>
