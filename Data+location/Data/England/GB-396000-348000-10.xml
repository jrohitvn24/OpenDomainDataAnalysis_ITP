		<title>10Wetley Rocks Old Tyme fair</title>
		<content>Each year around the Wetley Rocks and  
Consall area there are spring and      
summer events. One such event is the   
olde tyme fayre at Wetley Rocks. This  
fayre has all kinds of different stalls
like the tombola, cake and food stall. 
There is also a fancy dress competition
for all ages which consists of dressing
up in olde tyme clothes.               
All the money goes to certain charities
in the area, like the local church.    
This fayre is in May and traditional   
maypole dancing by the local children  
is one of the main attractions. The    
parades and Troop dances come from     
outside the area.                      
Wetley Rocks is quite a small village  
so nearly all the villagers come to    
this fayre as well as people from the  
Werrington area.
