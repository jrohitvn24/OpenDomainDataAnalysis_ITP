		<content> Geological ages ago the Thames bed was
probably something over a hundred feet 
higher than at the present time and the
river flowed over this terrain from    
what is now Pangbourne direct to       
Henley, where it was joined by the     
Loddon which to-day enters at Wargrave.
                                       
*************** {WELLS} ***************
It may be inferred therefore that wells
were both important to the community   
and costly to dig, because they had    
necessarily to be deep. Dunsden Well,  
which has now been sealed and provided 
with a canopy to protect the remains of
the original winding gear made by the  
firm of Wilder, was dug in 1878 to a   
depth of one hundred and fifty feet,"at
the expense of Susanna Caroline Palmer 
and Isobella Crawshay for the          
inhabitants of Dunsden for ever", to   
quote the commemorative tablet.        </content>
