 other exhibitions and rallies. there  
 is a steam collection at hollycombe   
 which includes roundabouts and a small
 railway and is open to the public on  
 bank holidays and sundays in the      
 summer.every church organises a summer
 fete or christmas bazaar to help its  
 funds, as do other organisations such 
 as schools,clubs and village halls.

 year an auction. the horticulture     
 society has an annual flower show, and
