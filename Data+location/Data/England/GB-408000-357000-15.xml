mainly young people.  The instruments

tenor horn, trombone, cornet and       
trumpet.  At the moment the band play  
for their own enjoyment but, they hope

     {The Warslow guide pack} was      
formed  in 1982 and has 10 members and 
two leaders.  They meet in the school  
hall on Fridays from 6.45p.m. until    
8.15p.m. Their time is spent playing   
games, working for badges or going on  
hikes. The pack has a link with the    
Ashbourne guide pack with whom they go 
camping every so often.  To raise      
funds for the pack and for charity,    
the guides have coffee evenings and    
sponsored events.                      </content>
