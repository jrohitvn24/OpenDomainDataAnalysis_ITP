		<content>The land around the school is formed of
sandstone overlain by glacial deposits 
after the last ice-age.It is a         
landscape of low hills and valleys     
which have been cut by numerous small  
streams feeding into the river Rea.The 
school is on the eastern side of one   
such small valley.                     
 The natural vegetation is deciduous   
mixed woodland although this has been  
masked by the housing developments with
their formal gardens.                  
 The climate is temperate and is       
affected by the prevailing south       
westerly winds.
