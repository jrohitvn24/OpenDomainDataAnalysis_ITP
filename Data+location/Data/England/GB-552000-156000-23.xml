<title>23Kemsing School Centenary</title>
<content>

Kemsing School is situated in the centre of the village. In 1985 it has celebrated its centenary. &lt;br />&lt;br />It opened in 1885 with a roll of 75. Attendance in those early days fluctuated greatly with the harvesting and hopping season.  &lt;br /> &lt;br /> Fenella, a pupil at the school now, tells us about a typical day in 1985: &lt;br /> &lt;br />  School begins with registration and assembly at 9am. Until playtime at 10.30 they work at mathematics. After a short break is English, a story to write, poetry, grammar work or reading. Dinner is at 12 until 1.10pm.  The afternoon work is art/craft, projects and sport. School finishes at 3.15pm. School clubs include Netball, Football, Swingball, Tennis, Cricket, Rounders and Swimming. &lt;br /> &lt;br />Whereas the number of students had been falling, the school is now over-subscribed and a new Head Teahcer was appointed in 2003.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Many families have moved away from Kemsing to find jobs and cheaper homes. &lt;br /> &lt;br />
