		<title>16MARWOOD S. MARWOOD SPORTS.</title>
		<content>    When my Grandad was a boy Marwood  
 Sports was a big event but it didn't  
 take place for many years.Then the    
 Marwood Sports and Social Committee   
 was formed so that we could celebrate 
 the Queen's  Silver Jubilee in 1977.  
 I was 4 then and we had sports and a  
 fancy dress for the children. We were 
 all presented with a mug from a horse 
 box by Mr.R.Balment.(I have still got 
 mine.) We also had tea.               
    Every year since then there has    
 been a Sports Day in May with  stalls 
 and sideshows. In the evening there is
 a Disco.At the sports for the last    
 couple of years there has been a      
 bouncy castle.                        
    The sports are now held at Chapel  
 Farm and the main event is the three  
 villages race. About 40 people run    
 through Guineaford,Kingsheanton,and   
 Prixford.There is a winners cup.      </content>
