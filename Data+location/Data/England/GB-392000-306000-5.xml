		<title>05FARMING SHIRE HORSES</title>
		<content>The most interesting farm in the area  
is Saredon Hall,a mixed farm of 400    
acres where the owner has been breeding
shire horses for 21 years.At the       
present time he has 17 shires and has  
won many awards at the annual Shire    
Horse Show at Peterborough.His 3 year  
old filly "Pure Gold" won the best mare
in Britain 1981.The horses are kept    
outside and graze happily with the     
cattle and sheep.They are used on the  
farm to cart feed to the other animals,
to harrow and for light haulage.The    
farmer has a complete set of horse     
drawn implements for use on the farm.  
The foals are sold mainly at home but  
have been exported to Ireland, Canada  
and America."Sandringham Snowflake" by 
his stallion "Saredon Emperor" was     
exported by the Queen to America.
