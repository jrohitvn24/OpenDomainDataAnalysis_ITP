		<title>10LUDFORD _ HIGH STREET FARM</title>
		<content> Typical Farm of this area. 189 acres  
 around farmhouse and another 106 else_
 where. All arable and crops of Winter 
 Wheat &amp; Barley, Oil Seed Rape &amp; Peas  
 in roughly equal proportions. 8 Acres 
 of pasture used occasionally when     
 calves bought at week old &amp; fed to    
 strong stores level, say 9_10 months &amp;
 then sold to go to Marshes area to    
 fatten. Because of elevated position  
 cattle could never fatten satisfactor_
 _ily and similarly Spring sown cereal 
 crops would never give a good return  
 as they could be up to 3 weeks later  
 than in warmer areas.For these reasons
 it is known as a 'Late Farm'. Local   
 saying is 'If eyesight good enough one
 could see the Urals'.Farmer is Vintage
 Motorcycle enthusiast and he and Wife 
 active community leaders _ Chuch      
 Warden and she President of Women's   
 Institute &amp;c.                         </content>
