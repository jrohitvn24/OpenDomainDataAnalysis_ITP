		<title>11Places to play in Spennells.</title>
		<content>    On the 1974 map we were given,     
 Spennells is shown as "the Bogs".     
 There were no houses then.  All our   
 class of 9 year-olds play  by the     
 stream and in Bluebell Wood.  People  
 jog and walk dogs there.  When the    
 Worcestershire Conservation Society   
 takes over the wood and marsh, our    
 school will help them.                
    All the roads are dead-ends and are
 named after birds.  We use the alley  
 ways between the roads to get around  
 on our bikes.  It takes longer by car.
 We have dens our mums don't know about
 by the building-sites. There are three
 play areas, two recreation fields, a  
 BMX track, but only one Portakabin    
 shop.  We go to Captain's Pool to feed
 the ducks.  The wild geese there wake 
 us up when they fly over.
