		<content>{Two very old houses}stand out as worth
 a mention.                            
{Poplars Farm}on the A46 dates mainly  
 from{1661}and a sundial on the south  
 wall links it  with the Gwinnett      
 family who also erected an identical  
 sundial dated 1665 on the south wall  
 of the Parish Church. The farm        
 building is now derelict, the subject 
 of a{preservation order,}but the owner
 cannot be traced.                     
{Church Farm}is part timber-framed, has
 been well maintained and dates from   
 the{late 17th century.}It is still a  
 thriving farm.                        
 Other old properties, late 18th       
 century, early 19th century, are      
 centred mainly around the junction of 
 the A46 and Leckhampton Lane and some 
 are scattered along the A46 to the    
 south of this junction.
