		<title>14AN 8 YEAR-OLD'S DAY</title>
		<content>    On a typical day I get up out of my
 bed. I go downstairs, and have my     
 breakfast which is cereal with milk. I
 go into the bathroom and have a wash. 
 I clean my teeth with a toothbrush and
 toothpaste. I get dressed in my school
 uniform. I get to school at 8.45. I   
 play a game of tig with my friends.   
 Tig is a running game where you chase 
 someone and try to tig them by        
 touching them. The whistle goes at    
 9.00. First I do mental arithmetic,   
 then we have assembly. I do hand-     
 writing and maths before playtime, and
 have a story before lunch. After this 
 I do more work, finishing with a story
 after last playtime.                  
    When I get home I do my homework if
 I have any. I like tea time because my
 whole family sit down together to eat.
 Sometimes I help with the washing up. 
 At 8.30pm I go to bed.                </content>
