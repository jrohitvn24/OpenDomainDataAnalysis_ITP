		<content>   I live on a building estate which is
not quite finished.One building company
has completed 48 houses and 3 are being
built.They started building the houses 
in 1983.They would like the estate     
finished by June 1985.Most houses have 
4 bedrooms but 12 rooms altogether.    
   One house takes about 13 weeks to   
build.They start work at 8 O'clock and 
finish at 5 O'clock.The prices vary    
from #44,750 to #61,000.               
   On the estate there is a Co-op      
Superstore,a Hairdresser,a Newsagent,a 
Chemist,a Public House,a Petrol Station
and a Community Hall.Parties and Discos
are held there.There is also a park    
being landscaped.                      
   The whole estate is being developed 
by many companies,and is one of the    
largest housing developments in the    
country.The area is being surveyed to  
incorporate this area on an O.S.Map.   </content>
