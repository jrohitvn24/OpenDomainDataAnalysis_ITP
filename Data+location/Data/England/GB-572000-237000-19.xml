		<title>19Traffic in Gt. Yeldham</title>
		<content> The A.604 road, which passes through  
 Gt.Yeldham,connects the industrial    
 Midlands to the East Coast ports of   
 Harwich and Felixstowe.It is therefore
 a relatively busy route, certainly the
 principal road in this block.A recent 
 traffic survey undertaken on a weekday
 morning revealed an hourly flow of 214
 vehicles,about one-third of which were
 commercial vehicles.A 40 m.p.h. speed 
 limit operates through the village    
 which we felt was reasonable because  
 visibility is quite good but we       
 believe that this limit is often      
 ignored, especially along the hill    
 near Gt.Yeldham School.This is a cause
 of concern to the staff of the School.
 The road has been subject to surface  
 water flooding and improvements are   
 now in hand to remedy this.These works
 cause traffic delays at busy times.
