		<content> Shildon, as any town, has its share of
 crime but recently various schemes    
 have been introduced by the Police    
 with the cooperation of the community.
 One of these schemes is known as      
 'Neighbourhood Watch'. The idea is    
 that residents keep their eyes and    
 ears open for suspicious behaviour    
 etc. and report these to an appointed 
 neighbour who has volunteered to act  
 as a liaison with the Police. A pilot 
 scheme has been set up and has proven 
 to be worthwhile. Other areas are now 
 being set up in the town as Police    
 manpower permits.                     
 Another scheme to combat break-ins and
 vandalism to schools is called        
 'Crimewatch'.Schools in the scheme are
 fitted with burglar alarms and        
 children are made aware of this.The   
 scheme is working well,in conjunction 
 with the Community policeman in school</content>
