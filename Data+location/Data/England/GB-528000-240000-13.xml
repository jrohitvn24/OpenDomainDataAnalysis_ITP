		<title>13Church Choir cont....</title>
		<content>  When we walk up to the choir         
 stalls,the boy holds a cross and we   
 all follow him.The sopranos file into 
 the choir stalls first,then the altos 
 go opposite the sopranos then the     
 tenors and basses at the back of the  
 sopranos have to use two stalls       
 because there are so many.The vicar   
 ,rector,leaders and the conductor go  
 at the end,we usally go two by two.   
  When we have finished the service we 
 walk out again and we go into the     
 vestry and say a prayer and undress   
 (we wear our robe over the top of our 
 clothes).We have drinks of tea and    
 cakes,biscuits.                       
  We go to King's College every year   
 there are many choirs who sing we all 
 join together and sing.It's good fun  
 because we walk through closed roads  
 walking to the college and everybody  
 takes pictures.                       </content>
