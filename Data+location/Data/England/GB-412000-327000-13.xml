		<title>13Draycott show</title>
		<content> Since 1905 there has always been an   
 annual agricultural and horticultural 
 show. At present it is kept going by  
 the hard work and interest of the     
 people running it.                    
                                       
 One of the main attractions is the    
 Show Tent which contains the          
 competition entries, which range from 
 flower arranging and dress making to  
 best vegetables and wine making. There
 are also childrens' competitions      
 including picture making, handwriting 
 and fancy dress.                      
                                       
 The most popular sideshows are the    
 Punch and Judy, tug of war, tossing   
 the sheaf (a bale of hay is thrown    
 over a horizontal bar, using a pole)  
 and the six aside football            
 competition.                          
                                       </content>
