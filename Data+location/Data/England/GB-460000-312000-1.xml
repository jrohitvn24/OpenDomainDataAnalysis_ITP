		<title>01Introduction to the area</title>
		<content> A large section of this rural area ,  
 caught between the Soar and Wreake    
 valleys,is farming land ,mainly       
 arable.A clay base  causes flooding,  
 and above this are terraces of sand   
 and grave. Some light industry thrives
 giving jobs to some of the three and  
 a half thousand people.The great Roman
 road,the Fosse passes through from    
 south to north as does the Midland    
 railway line.Village primary schools  
 serve younger children,while the older
 ones have a state Upper school and the
 public school.Politcally,this has     
 always been a Conservtive area,and is 
 run by Charnwood District Council,who 
 control planning,housing and refuse   
 collection. Cossington and Ratcliffe  
 have a restraint order on them to     
 prevent growth.East Goscote is a self 
 contained village built new thirty    
 years ago.By Mrs Elsie Dakin.         </content>
