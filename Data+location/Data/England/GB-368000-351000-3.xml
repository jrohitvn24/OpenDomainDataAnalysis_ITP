		<title>03A DAY IN THE LIFE OF RACHAEL</title>
		<content> Saturday is a special day because I go
 to French lessons. When I'm there, my 
 mummy is in town, and my little sister
 Sarah is at Tap or Ballet dancing.    
 Daddy wil be washing his new car.     
 Grandad will be cuddling our black cat
 with the white blob on the end of his 
 tail. His name is Jason. I like to    
 play with my friend Wendy on a        
 Saturday as well. We like to play with
 the cat, when we are in the mood for  
 it. For dinner we have chicken and    
 chips. Saturday night s good for the  
 television. I like the Terry and June 
 programme and also Only Fools and     
 Horses, Juliet Bravo and the Noel     
 Edwards Late Late Breakfast Show, also
 a couple of other programmes.
