		<title>07THE COWICK ORDINANCE</title>
		<content> Cowick, for a brief period became the 
 unofficial seat of Government in 1323.
 Edward 11 called a meeting of his     
 council at Cowick and hammered out an 
 agreement with his ministers known as 
 the Cowick Ordinance. The purpose of  
 this document was to introduce graeter
 efficiency into the keeping of the    
 Royal accounts.                       
 An indication of the importance of    
 this piece of legislation can be      
 gleaned from the presence of the      
 Archbishop of York, The Bishop of     
 Exeter, The Earls of Kent, Pembroke,  
 Norfolk,Arudal and Surrey.            
 In order to make the Manor House fit  
 for the meeting building operations   
 costing over Â£300 were undertaken.
