		<content> Much of the chalk downs has been put  
 down to arable crops, but the slopes  
 still reflect remnants of downland    
 turf and the associated flor -        
 orchids, yellow rattle, harebells,    
 cowslips, campion etc., which attracts
 the chalk blue and orange tip         
 butterflies.  One can also find the   
 brimstone, peacock, red admiral,      
 tortoiseshell and gatekeeper          
 butterflies.  There are badgers and   
 adders, and rabbits are once more     
 grazing here, their return helping to 
 inhibit the encroachment of shrubs and
 course grass.  There is a wide variety
 of birds, including woodpeckers,      
 yellowhammers, gold crests, linnets,  
 and fen birds, including the          
 cornbunting can be seen.
