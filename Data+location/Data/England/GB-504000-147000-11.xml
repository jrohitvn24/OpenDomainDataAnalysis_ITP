		<title>11SHERE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Shere C.of E.First School has 42    
 pupils in July 1985. It is a split    
 site with three buildings. The oldest 
 building was built in 1842, today this
 is the school hall. The school        
 helper,Mrs.Askew brought her parents  
 Mr.&amp; Mrs.Woods into the school to talk
 to us.                                
   They both came to Shere school as   
 pupils in 1927. Today they arrived in 
 a 1938 Austin Seven convertable car   
 which we all enjoyed looking at.      
   Their daughter,Mrs.Askew and her    
 daughter came to Shere school as well.
   We asked if the school has changed? 
 The buildings have not changed.  The  
 present hall used to be used for wood 
 work and cookery in the 1930s.        
 Children from other villages came into
 use these facilities when they were   
 aged between 12 and 14 years.
