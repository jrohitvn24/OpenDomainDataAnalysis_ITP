		<title>03LIFE IN A TOWER BLOCK.</title>
		<content>{I live in Cottingley Heights,the}high-
 est block of flats in Leeds,having 24 
 storeys.                              
{As the lifts often breakdown,I am     
 glad that my flat is on the ground    
 floor. The flats were opened in       
 April,1972 by Alderman Bellow,Leader  
 of the Leeds City Council.I do not    
 like living in the flats because pets 
 are not allowed and I would love to   
 have a dog.{I have a key which opens  
 the main door to the flats.When my    
 friends call they have to speak to me 
 through an intercom system,and then   
 I press a button in the flat which    
 opens the main door.{The view from the
 top of the flats is fantastic.I can   
 see all over Leeds,and on a very clear
 day,York Minster is visible,26 miles  
 away.
