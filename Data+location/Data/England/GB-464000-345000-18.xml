		<title>18MOTOR-CYCLING.A RACE VISIT.</title>
		<content>  My favourite sport is motor-cycling  
 and my favourite riders are Randy     
 Mamola,Eddie Lawson and Freddie       
 Spencer.                              
  Last year I went to the British Grand
 Prix.During one race there was a bad  
 crash and 2 riders came off their     
 bikes at 100mph.All the people with   
 cameras rushed to take photos whilst  
 the other riders were still going     
 round the track at about 150 mph.     
  The race organisers didn't stop the  
 race until 3 laps later.The race was  
 delayed for about thirty minutes while
 the track was cleared.Sadly both      
 riders were killed in the crash.      
  I watched two other good races;one   
 with 250 cc bikes and one with 350 cc 
 bikes competing.
