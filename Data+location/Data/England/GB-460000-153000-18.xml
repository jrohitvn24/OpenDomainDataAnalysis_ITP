		<content> This is an area steeped in the history
 of man.  There is evidence of         
 Neolithic activity. Bronze Age man    
 inhabitied the area.  The debris of   
 Iron Age settlements are to be found. 
 The Roman/Romano British presence is  
 in evidence both in building and      
 artifact remains.  The area is        
 traversed by an important Roman Road  
 linking Winchester with Silchester.   
 The area was documented in the        
 Domesday Book and contains            
 archeological evidence of Medieval    
 settlements. The church at Sherborne  
 St. John dates from circa 1150, that  
 of Monk Sherborne is of similar date. 
 The history of the area in the Tudor  
 and Tudor period is entwined with the 
 fortunes of the owners of the Vyne    
 Estate, which were at the highest     
 level. The area increasingly became   
 linked with Basingstoke from then on. </content>
