		<title>09LIVING IN CHURCH STRETTON</title>
		<content>    I think{Church Stretton}is a nice  
 place to live. There are plenty of    
 walks and it attracts lots of tourists
 every year.                           
    The views are very nice all the    
 year round. The hills look especially 
 beautiful in the autumn when the      
 trees' leaves change colour. Then it  
 looks like a blanket of many colours. 
    In the winter people say it is     
{'Little Switzerland'}when snow        
 sparkles on the tops of the hills     
 which seem like mountains.            
    Most of the people are friendly    
 which is very nice. I like going to   
 Church Stretton Primary School because
 most of my friends go there.          
                                       
    I like living in Church Stretton.  
 I don't think I ever want to move.
