		<content>     St Peter's church is quiet and    
peaceful like any other church.It is   
shaped like a cross.St Peter's church  
has a tower which is quite tall.       
     Churches are very popular.Some    
people go to church everyweek.Church is
very important for some people.        
     When we walk inside the church a  
man gives you your hymn book.Then we go
and find a seat and listen to the vicar
who talks about Jesus.Then we have     
prayers and sing hymns.                
     St Peter's church is at the side  
of Stapenhill Gardens.There are some   
pretty flowers in there.               
     People have weddings and          
christenings in the church.At Christmas
our school go to the church and we have
a christmas service.We sing christmas  
carols and each "year" sings a song.   
     Vicars are friendly,they are just 
like anybody else.                     </content>
