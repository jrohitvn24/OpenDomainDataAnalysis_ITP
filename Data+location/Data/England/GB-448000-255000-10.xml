		<content>{Village.}Sheltered by steep hillside  
 to east; small fields, unkempt hedges 
 &amp; copses. Wide range of tree species, 
 only 25% were elm &amp; died. Variety of  
 nest habitats encourage rarer birds   
 (green finch, song thrush). New lake  
 at The Manor improving landscape &amp;    
 wildlife value. Footpaths well used.  
{Surrounding Countryside.}Intensive    
 arable farming in large fields; few   
 hedgerow trees, 60% were elms &amp; died, 
 smaller ash &amp; few oak left. No woods, 
 lakes; few meadows, spinneys; neat    
 hedges; fox &amp; occasional badger; only 
 common birds. New copses provide cover
 for 1000 pheasants. Single cut of road
 verges increasing botanical interest. 
 Few use unmarked, unattractive paths. 
{Noise.}Little traffic; occasional low 
 flying jet or late pub closing.       
{Pollution.}Only September stubble     
 burning; coal &amp; wood fires in winter. </content>
