		<title>13FARLEIGH HOUSE: FARLEIGH</title>
		<content>{ FARLEIGH HOUSE}WAS BUILT IN 1800 AND 
 REBUILT IN 1890. IT WAS A PRIVATE     
 HOUSE UNTIL 1970, WHEN IT BECAME A    
 SCHOOL FOR DYSLEXIC CHILDREN. THERE   
 ARE 72 PUPILS: 60 BOYS AND 12         
 GIRLS. THE COLOUR OF THEIR UNIFORM IS 
 BROWN AND CREAM. THEIR LESSONS ARE THE
 SAME AS IN AN ORDINARY SCHOOL, BUT    
 THEY DON'T LEARN ANY FOREIGN          
 LANGUAGES. ALL THE CHILDREN BOARD AT  
 THE SCHOOL. THEY HAVE 9 WEEKS' HOLIDAY
 IN THE SUMMER, AND 4 WEEKS AT EASTER. 
  IN THE HOUSE, THERE ARE 24 BEDROOMS  
 AND 8 BATHROOMS. OTHER FACILITIES     
 INCLUDE A T.V ROOM AND A GAMES ROOM.  
 THEY MOVED INTO THIS HOUSE IN 1970    
 BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH ROOM 
 AT THE PREVIOUS SCHOOL IN BECKINGTON. 
  THE AREA SURROUNDING THE SCHOOL      
 CONSISTS MAINLY OF GRASSLAND, OF WHICH
 THE SCHOOL OWNS 24 ACRES.
