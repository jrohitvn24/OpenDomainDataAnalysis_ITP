		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> On Sept  20th.  I went to Butlins at  
 Minehead. We had a go on a ghost      
 train. It had a blue FLUORESCENT light
 shining on a ghost through a door     
 which goes down a hill . Then I went  
 on the Big Dipper and went up until I 
 was in the  air .We went on the space 
 invader. It was dark .It went up then 
 down very fast.I went back to our     
 caravanette for a meal. We  went back 
 to the fair  and  went on the rockets 
 which  went round and round .We got on
 the cable cars that took me to the    
 other side of Butlins and went on the 
 small motor bikes. I ran into the     
 straw bales.I enjoyed the big wheel   
 and finally the water boats.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
