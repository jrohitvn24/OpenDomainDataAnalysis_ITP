		<title>12FARMING  DARTMOOR</title>
		<content>      Farmers no longer keep pigs for  
 salted and smoked meat.They use more  
 convenience foods.They keep chicken   
 for eggs and cats and dogs for pets.  
      The women worked hard at hay-    
 making and harvest time.When they made
 hay ricks they thatched them with     
 rushes tied with hay ropes which they 
 had twisted.Now machines bale the hay 
 and combine harvesters process the    
 wheat.They used to work from 6a.m.to  
 10p.m.but machinery has made life     
 easier.During {World War Two}and      
 before horses were used for pulling   
 carts and ploughs.Horses were shod at 
 Ashburton or Widecombe.After the war  
 tractors replaced horses.The smithy   
 and carpenter's shop at {Buckland}used
 to provide gatehangings,wheelbarrows  
 and tools but they are now private    
 homes as is the schoolroom.Children go
 to Widecombe or Ashburton schools now.</content>
