		<title>07JERSEY ROYAL POTATO (1)</title>
		<content>    The Jersey Royal potato year starts
 in October. The seed potatoes, which  
 were harvested at the end of June,and 
 tipped into trays in lofts and sheds  
 with plenty of ventilation, are now   
 graded into four sizes. Each potato   
 has its shoots broken off, and they   
 are then 'stood' individually in      
 trays, which are stacked in single    
 rows to allow light and ventilation to
 ensure even growth of the new young   
 shoots.                               
                                       
    In January or early February the   
 fields are ploughed to clean them, and
 fertilizer is evenly spread over them.
 The soil is then broken up into a fine
 tilth before the potatoes are planted 
 (in February), and the fields are then
 sprayed to prevent weeds growing.
