		<title>10A Primary School Day</title>
		<content> I was excited when I went to school   
 this morning.We were going up to the  
 6th form college to do our            
 'Games'.It's great fun!After          
 assembly,at nine o'clock, we finished 
 our maths then got our games kit.We   
 walked to the college and were having 
 races around the running track in the 
 grounds.The whole class was exhausted 
 when we walked back to school.We had  
 missed morning playtime,which is      
 usually at 10:30,because we come back 
 late.There was 15 minutes till lunch  
 time,we did maths till it was time for
 lunch at 12 o'clock.After lunch we    
 finished drawing our wild             
 animals.Afternoon break was at        
 2:15.After break we finished drawing  
 and then composed a poem.School ended 
 at 3:30.
