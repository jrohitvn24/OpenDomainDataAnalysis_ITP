		<content> The area is one of sharp contrasts.   
 Military activity at St Mawgan has    
 given rise to the establishment of a  
 Peace Chapel near Trebarber farm and  
 Bank holiday protests by C.N.D. groups
 lead to an influx of tents and police 
 reinforcements. Porth reservoir       
 supplies the massive summer population
 and has not failed in recent droughts 
 and affords pleasure to anglers and   
 yachtsmen. The large Chapel dairy farm
 provides other liquid sustenance. The 
 railway branch line has often been    
 threatened since the days of the      
 Beeching axe but provides a skeleton  
 service in winter and is still heavily
 used in the holiday season -hence its 
 survival. Quintrell Downs which has   
 recently seen substantial residential 
 development doggedly retains its      
 individuality.
