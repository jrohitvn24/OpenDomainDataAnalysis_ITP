<title>19Hemel Hempstead: A town in decline</title>
<content>

Since the mid-1980s, many of the features of the town have declined or disappeared. We now have no hospital and must travel to Watford. Dacorum College of FE is now part of West Herts College and is very run down. The Pavilion, the only decent sized entertainment centre, has been demolished by the council who have no plans to replace it. The town's parks and gardens look tattier and more unloved every year. The paddling pool in Gadebridge Park has been closed down, to save a paltry Â£15k a year. The Water Gardens in the town centre are a disgrace. It''s overrun with Canada geese, which eat every scrap of greenery and defecate everywhere. They should be culled.   &lt;br />
