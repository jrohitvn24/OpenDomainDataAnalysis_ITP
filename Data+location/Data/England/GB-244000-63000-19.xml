		<content>   The Maristow side of the river can  
 be approached at low tide by crossing 
 the concrete footbridge or the road   
 ford at Lopwell Dam. The access roads 
 are very steep, but some Plymothians  
 come down at the week-end. The        
 agriculture is large scale arable     
 farming and some dairy farming. There 
 ia a considerable area of marshy land.
   Maristow House is owned by Lord     
 Roborough and is a family             
 seat,although no longer occupied. It  
 has suffered three fires in its       
 history and the last one, arson,caused
 damage amounting to 1.5 million       
 pounds. It has been temporarily       
 covered and the house is having       
 woodwork affected by dry rot removed. 
 The only room untouched by the        
 disastrous fire was Lord Roborough's  
 father's study.The surrounding land   
  is used for Scout and Guide camps.   </content>
