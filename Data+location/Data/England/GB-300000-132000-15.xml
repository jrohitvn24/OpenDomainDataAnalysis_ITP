		<title>15THE INCLINE</title>
		<content> Just passed the chapel near Ralegh's  
 Cross you enter the Exmoor National   
 Park and on the right hand side of the
 road is the famous incline. This is a 
 relic of the days of iron ore mining  
 in the Brendons and the iron used to  
 be transported by rail down this mile 
 long man made slope for shipping to   
 South Wales.                          
 The remains of the winding house can  
 still be seen as can the foundations  
 of a row of miners cottages long since
 demolished. This is also the end of   
 the now demolished Brendon Hill       
 railway and you can still see the     
 remains of the station.               
                                       
 The mining reached its peak about a   
 hundred years ago and apart from the  
 incline little trace of it now        
 remains.                              
                                       </content>
