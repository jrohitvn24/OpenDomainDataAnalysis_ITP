My name is Thea Pitchers.I am eight    
years old and I go to Brownies. We     
are all from seven to ten years old    
and we are going to Guides when we are 
older. We all make a special Brownie   
promise. This is the promise."I promise
that I will do my best to do my duty to
God, to serve the Queen and to help    
other people and to keep the Brownie   
Guide Law." Then we all have a game of 
skittles. The work we do is this. We   
work for badges and we collect for     
the R.S.P.C.A.                         
   My name is Matthew Caton and I go to
Cubs. We go to Cubs at half past six.  
We go to learn things like how to get  
badges and how to light fires. We learn
how to cook on camp fires and how to   
pitch tents.We have our meetings in    
a small hall with four rooms.
