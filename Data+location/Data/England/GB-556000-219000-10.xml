		<title>10THE OLD RAILWAY</title>
		<content> Until 1955 Takeley had a passenger    
 railway which was built in 1869 to    
 connect Bishop's Stortford with       
 Witham.It remained open to goods until
 1965 when it was used mainly to       
 transport bananas to the Geest factory
 at Little Canfield.The rails have now 
 been taken up and the track makes a   
 pleasant bridle path. However this may
 have to go to make a way for a road   
 scheme as has been done at Great      
 Dunmow.At present it does provide a   
 sanctuary for both people and animals 
 away from the bustle and noise of the 
 main road.Today however this quiet may
 often be destroyed by the noise and   
 danger of motor cycles.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
