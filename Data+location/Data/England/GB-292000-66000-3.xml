 including red campion,arum lily,      
 buttercup,dandelion,valerium,wild     
 violets,groundsel,celandine,cow       
 parsley and poppies.A family of house 
 sparrows were nesting in the old court
 house.Other birds seen were blackbirds
 ,blue tits,kestrels and black headed  
 gull.There is a Judas tree growing in 
 the grounds of the Court House Hotel. 
 The animals and plants are all healthy
 because there is no pollution to spoil
 the plants or the area.The footpaths  
 are well cared for and the hedges grow
 wild.The beaches are clean and not    
 spoilt by man.
