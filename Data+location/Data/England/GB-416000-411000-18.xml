		<title>18THE SHOVEL WORKS</title>
		<content> The original Richard Carter shovel    
 works was built in 1740. It covers    
 over an acre of land and employs 17   
 people. Ever since 1740 it has been in
 the Carter family. When it was opened 
 other plants were opened but they have
 all shut down since then. Around      
 12,000 shovels, 8,000 handles and     
 about 12,000 hammer and axe shafts are
 made a month, all of which are sold.  
 During the miners strike the sale of  
 shovels dropped, as 75% are sold to   
 the NCB. All parts of the shovels are 
 made at the works. The main materials 
 used to make shovels are steel and    
 aluminium. The shovel works do their  
 own deliveries as long as they can get
 there and back in a day. Otherwise    
 they take the deliveries to Birmingham
 or Carlisle so the next leg of the    
 journey can be done. Also the works   
 send exports to Canada and Nigeria.   </content>
