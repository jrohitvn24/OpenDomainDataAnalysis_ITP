		<title>18Fight to save Weston School</title>
		<content> In both 1981 and 1984 local parents   
 mounted campaigns to save the{Village 
{School}from closure by Oxfordshire    
 County Council due to falling rolls.  
 The threat to the stone and thatch    
 school where Weston children had been 
 educated for over 130 years roused    
 strong feelings in the community on   
 both occasions.  This was reflected   
 in packed village meetings and noisy  
{demonstrations}in Oxford.             
                                       
 In 1981 parents argued successfully   
 that the cost of bussing children to  
 another school would hardly undercut  
 that of keeping Weston School open.   
 By 1984 the number of pupils had drop-
 ped from 23 to 9 and it was considered
 unlikely to rise above 20 in the fore-
 seeable future.  Following the retire-
 ment of the Head Teacher the school   
 was closed in December 1984.          </content>
