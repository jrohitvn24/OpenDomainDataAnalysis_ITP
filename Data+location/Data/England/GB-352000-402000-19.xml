		<title>19A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> My alarm goes off at 7.30a.m. and I   
 get up out of my bed and have a wash  
 and clean my teeth.Then I put my      
 school uniform on and go down for my  
 breakfast which is a cup of tea.Then I
 go for the newspaper.At 8.45a.m. I set
 off for school.My dinner-time is spent
 at school.School finishes at 3.45p.m. 
 When I get home I have my tea and then
 watch television for a couple of      
 hours.After that my evening is spent  
 playing sports.My favourite sports are
 football and cricket,which I play on  
 Lamberhead Green school fields.I then 
 have my supper which is normally just 
 a light snack of toast and biscuits.I 
 usually eat this while watching       
 television.I frequently read for an   
 hour in bed before going to sleep.
