		<content>CREETING ST. MARY CHURCH               
  This building, mainly of flint, was  
founded in Norman times. The North     
doorway dates from this period and     
the porch from Tudor times. The font   
dates from 1462. The church was        
heavily restored in the 19th century.  
  Church services vary each week. The  
present priest-in-charge is Canon      
Paul Davison, The Vicarage, Needham    
Market, Suffolk.                       
WEST CREETING ST. PETER CHURCH         
  The present building dates mainly    
from the 13th and 14th centuries,      
though there is a Norman door in the   
North wall. The church was restored in 
the 1800's. There is an interesting    
St. Christopher wall painting. The     
font is Perpendicular.                 
  Church services vary each week. The  
priest-in-charge is Rev. Brian Baker,  
The Rectory, Earl Stonham.             </content>
