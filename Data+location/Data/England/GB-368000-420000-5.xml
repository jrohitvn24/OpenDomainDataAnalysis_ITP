		<title>05Leisure and Recreation</title>
		<content> After completing the survey about     
 leisure &amp; recreation in Darwen,we     
 found that a large majority of people 
 used the leisure centre in Darwen,only
 a small percentage travelled outside  
 the town to other centres.Darwen      
 leisure centre seems to be used at    
 least once a week on a regular basis  
 for a variety of activities.By far the
 most common activity is swimming.Many 
 of the people thought that the centre 
 was a good one,though it could be made
 better by having a wider selection of 
 activities,by opening longer,more     
 flexible hours &amp; by having better     
 facilities.Most people enjoy doing    
 some sporting activities in their     
 leisure time,even though they don't   
 have much leisure time to play        
 with.Other activities people enjoy    
 doing include,gardening,reading,D.I.Y 
 .and visiting other places.           </content>
