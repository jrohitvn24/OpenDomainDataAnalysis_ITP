		<content>  Old{Orpington} is centred around the 
{Priory} and the {Saxon church}. Both  
these buildings are constructed of     
local flint and stone. A saxon sundial 
was found when a new extension was     
being built for the church. The Priory 
dates from the {12th century}, being a 
manor house and not a monastic         
establishment. Today it is the local   
{museum} and is surrounded by          
{gardens} and ornamental ponds         
supplied by {underground springs}.     
The church was extended in 1957 to     
cater for the increase in the number   
of parishoners. Two other large houses 
were to be found in Orpington, {Bart   
Hart House} and the {Walnuts}. These   
houses have now been destroyed to make 
way for redevelopment.
