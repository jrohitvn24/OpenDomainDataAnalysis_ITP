		<title>07BOOKIE'S CLERK FROM GRAFFHAM</title>
		<content>   I interviewed a clerk who likes his 
 job because he enjoys gambling and    
 likes horses.  His favourite jockey is
 Lester Piggot and his favourite horse 
 is Njinsky.  His favourite course is  
 Goodwood because of the scenery.  He  
 lives in Selham.  When he is at work  
 he writes down all the bets and works 
 out the liability of each horse and   
 the figures, then he calculates what  
 they will win or lose in each race.   
 He thinks that 15 is a good number of 
 horses to have in a race for          
 betting. He begins work at 1.30 p.m.  
 and finishes at 5 o'clock.  He travels
 all around the country and lived in   
 London before he moved here.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
