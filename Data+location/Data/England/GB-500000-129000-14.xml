		<title>14PLAISTOW CHURCH AND CHAPEL</title>
		<content>{The Church is called The Holy Trinity.
 It was built in 1856. In the old times
 a little boy pumped air into the organ
 quite fast, then the organist could   
 play. There is one bell in the church,
 and a very old man rings it. People   
 who attend the church kneel on        
 hassocks made by lady members of the  
 church. They are embroidered with     
 pictures of boats and swords. There is
 no graveyard in the church. If people 
 want their relatives to be buried in a
 churchyard they have to go to{Kirdford
{Church}which is three miles away.{This
{is the sister church.                 
                                       
{The Chapel}was built in 1907 by the   
 congregation, with bricks donated by a
 local lady. It is a Baptist chapel.   
 About 12 people attend a fortnightly  
 service.
