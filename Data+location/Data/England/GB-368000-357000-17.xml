		<content>   This used to occupy two buildings,  
 one a single-room 'hall' that was the 
 old school, and a newer               
 multi-classroomed building that is now
 the main school.  Several years ago,  
 the other building (now an annex), was
 dropped from use.                     
   Although the sign still remains     
 outside the annex, it is slowly but   
 surely falling into a state of        
 disrepair.  It is reminiscent of the  
 old country schools that can still be 
 found in some parts of Britain.
