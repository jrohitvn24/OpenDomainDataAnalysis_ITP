		<title>11The Fox public house, Ousden</title>
		<content> The village pub is always a popular   
 meeting place and the Fox is no       
 exception, not only with local people 
 but with some customers coming some   
 miles to enjoy a drink. It has two    
 bars, public and saloon, and a very   
 nice garden where one can sit in the  
 summer months. Many of the regular    
 customers enjoy various games such as 
 cards, dominoes or darts and there is 
 a pool table. In the saloon bar there 
 is a piano, and now and again they    
 have a sing song. During the week,    
 various foods are served from a packet
 of crisps or peanuts to a full meal.  
 The landlady holds the pub licence in 
 her own right; but the Fox is actually
 owned by Greene King Brewery, as are  
 most of the pubs in this area.
