		<title>13LIFE IN NEWNHAM</title>
		<content> Newnham is a very small hamlet.There  
 are no services in the village apart  
 from the church.                      
 The most important people in the      
 village are the Farr family. They own 
 most of the farmland around Newnham   
 and a brother and sister own the two  
 largest houses.Some people in the     
 village call Mr. Farr the "guv'nor".  
 Newnham is a very quiet place.If you  
 like living in the countryside it must
 be ideal.But you need a car or a good 
 bike to get anywhere.                 
 Standing in Newnham you would never   
 believe that the busy A1 dual         
 carriageway passes about 1.5 Km. from 
 the hamlet.                           
 It is a very traditional farming      
 community though there are a few      
 non-farming families who have moved   
 in.                                   
                                       </content>
