		<title>17WATER LANE ALLOTMENTS</title>
		<content> About two miles from our school there 
 are some allotments. They were opened 
 in 1922. There are one hundred and    
 thirty nine plots either five or ten  
 rod (one rod equals three square      
 yards). To have an allotment costs    
 5Op. per rod and most people have five
 or ten rods, but a few people have    
 more than one plot. You are allowed 1 
 shed on the plot and it must be twenty
 square feet floor area. To get a plot 
 you need to apply to the council. Most
 people grow vegetables on their plot  
 but you can grow flowers.             
 There are very few overgrown plots    
 because if you do leave your plot to  
 run wild then the council will reclaim
 it. Most people walk to the allotments
 and live within half a mile. Most of  
 the allotment holders are retired     
 people who visit the allotments almost
 every day in summer.                  </content>
