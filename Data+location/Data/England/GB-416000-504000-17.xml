		<title>17TRAFFIC NEAR GILLING WEST</title>
		<content> Gilling is situated near the{A66}north
 of Scotch Corner.The{A66 is very busy 
 because it is a major road leading to 
 Scotland. We went to the top of       
 Gilling Bank and did a traffic count. 
 In half an hour we counted{139        
{vehicles travelling North}and{147     
{vehicles going South.}Some of the     
 traffic was travelling very fast.     
 Our local Parish Council is very      
 concerned about the{speed of traffic  
 at the{Gilling turn-off.}The Parish   
 Council want a{deceleration lane}on   
 the A66 where the{Gilling/Melsonby    
{road}crosses at present. This would   
 make{traffic flow more easily, and    
{safely,}to and from Gilling.          
 Before this can happen the necessary  
 land has to be purchased. The Parish  
 Council hope that this scheme will be 
 started in{1986.
