		<title>15Kettlesing - At Prayer</title>
		<content>   There are two religious establish-  
 ments within the block.  The Anglican 
 church at Felliscliffe (above         
 Kettlesing village) was built in 1897 
 by local benevolence, and now has no  
 resident minister, but is served by   
 the vicar of Hampsthwaite.            
   Kettlesing Methodist Chapel was re- 
 built in the 1930's, and is opposite  
 the site of the older chapel (now a   
 house) built in 1790, one of the      
 oldest Methodist chapels in Nidder-   
 dale. It reflects the strong Weslyan  
 tradition amongst the former farmer/  
 weavers.  It it believed there were   
 other temporary chapels before this,  
 notably at Longscales, above Kettle-  
 sing.                                 
   Both churches now suffer from       
 dwindling and aging congregations.
