		<content>Our school is called Ribchester C.E.   
school,it is quite small,it only has   
38 children and two teachers. It was   
built in 1871 with a new extension in  
1978. It  is a Church of England       
school. The school has only three      
classrooms and a hall. We visited St   
Peters and St Pauls school in the      
village,to ask some questions. They    
have eighteen children and four        
rooms they also have two teachers.It   
opened about 130 years ago. All the    
children will go to our school in

ask some questions. There are          
twenty-four children. Their mums stay  
with them. The children are aged 2-4,  
go to Playgroup on Tuesdays and        
Thursdays from 9.30- 12.00 . They
