		<content> This part of the coast was constantly 
 eroded by a scouring tide which rises 
 to more than thirty feet.             
 The shore is protected between        
 Clevedon and Weston Super Mare by a   
 double bank or sea wall. The inner    
 bank which is a very old one was not  
 an adequate protection when tides     
 were particularly high or in storm    
 conditions .History relates some very 
 spectacular inundations, the worst    
 was in 1606 when many people drowned  
 and the water lay to a depth of 5 feet
 for ten days.                         
 The outer sea wall was constructed at 
 the end of the Second World War by    
 prisoner of war labour and is a rock  
 and concrete construction which only  
 fails to stop flooding on very rare   
 occasions,and means that animals can  
 use the pastures all the year round.
