		<content>    There is no longer any police      
 station in our area, but a community  
 policeman is attached to Mannamead and
 parts of Peverell and he is in        
 communication with Crownhill Police   
 Station.                              
    The Mutley area has no such cover, 
 but if summoned, panda patrols will be
 sent from Charles Church police       
 station in the city centre.           
    There is only one traffic warden,  
 who covers Mutley Plain and parts of  
 Peverell.                             
    We also identified twenty three    
 firms of solicitors, although we were 
 not able to ascertain the exact number
 of solicitors employed in these firms.
    The area has a fire station at     
 Greenbank. There are four fire engines
 and the firemen work in shifts of     
 fifteen men.
