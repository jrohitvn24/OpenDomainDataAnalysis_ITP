		<title>20CRAIGNANT OLD QUARRY</title>
		<content>      A planning application has been  
 made to the local council  to use     
{Craignant old quarry}as a{waste dump.}
 Local people are very anxious about   
 this proposal. The people we          
 interviewed said the roads were much  
 too narrow and bendy to take heavy    
 goods vehicles. Others were upset     
 about its effect upon the wildlife of 
 the area and the ugly scar it would   
 make on the landscape. Most of the    
 local people have signed a{petition } 
 and  sent it to the council strongly  
 objecting to the use of the quarry as 
 a dump.
