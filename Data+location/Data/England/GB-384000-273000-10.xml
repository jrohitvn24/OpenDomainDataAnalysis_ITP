		<title>10Spennells Estate.</title>
		<content>    A school survey showed that        
 families moving onto the new Spennells
 estate, South of Kidderminster, were  
 attracted by cheap, "up-market"       
 houses, and the availability of self  
 build schemes.  38% of families moved 
 from other parts of Kidderminster, and
 46% came from the West Midlands and   
 Birmingham.  53% of the men commute   
 back to this area daily, and only 28% 
 work locally.  The male unemployment  
 rate is 9%, mainly on the council     
 estate.  67% of households have       
 children under 18, and few of these   
 have relatives within a 10 mile       
 radius.  The birth-rate is high, and  
 only 4% of houses have people over 60.
 28% of women are employed, mainly in  
 local part-time work.  Of the 203     
 children at the First School, 9%      
 belong to single-parent families or   
 have step-parents.                    </content>
