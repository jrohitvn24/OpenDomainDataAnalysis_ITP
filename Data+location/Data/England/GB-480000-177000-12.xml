 parts. It has 12 rooms, a Theatre and 
 Studios.                              
                                       
 In{1924} it was bought by {Ivor       
{Novello} who lived in it until his    
 death in 1950.                        
 He wrote the well known song{" We'll  
{gather lilacs "}while living there.   
 He left it to the Actor's Benevolent  
 Fund who ran it as  a home for actors 
 until{1954.}It was then sold and      
 turned into flats.                    
                                       
 In {1964} the present owners purchased
 it and turned it into a {Drama School.
                                       
 The school still uses this property   
 but is so popular for the education of
 budding actors and actresses that they
 also use buildings in Maidenhead.     </content>
