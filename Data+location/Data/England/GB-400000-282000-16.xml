		<content>   Sgt. Reynolds from Bournville Lane  
Police Station talked to us about      
police work on beat 26 in B2 Division. 
Every hour the police get about 80     
calls for help. In March 1985 the most 
common crime was house breaking. Crime 
is increasing in this area; more cars  
have been stolen or broken into this   
year &amp; more people have been attacked. 
Instead of using a blackboard to       
record  crime figures, police now use  
computers.  As well as solving crimes  
the police help the public in many     
ways. They give advice about           
protecting  property against thieves.  
Our local police come into school to   
teach us road safety &amp; to warn us      
about dangerous places to play in this 
area. Sometimes they bring their dogs  
&amp; vehicles to show us and equipment    
such as handcuffs, truncheons and      
radios. Our police are friendly.       </content>
