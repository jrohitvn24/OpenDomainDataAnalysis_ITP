{Penhale Army Training Camp}was built  
 in l938 and during the Second World   
 War was used for artillery supplies   
 and for training American soldiers    
 with coastal guns.  On 7th July, l940,
 the camp was bombed and 7 people were 
 killed instantly.  Later 24 more      
 soldiers were killed as they checked  
 other bombs which had been set with   
 timing devices.  Today the camp is    
 used for training all kinds of        
 soldiers such as Cadets, Territorial  
 Army, Marines and the Navy.           
                                       
 Some of the land has been sold to the 
 National Trust for use as a car park. 
 Of the remaining 2000 acres, l0l      
 buildings occupy 500 acres.  When full
 to capacity the camp can accommodate  
 800 persons.
