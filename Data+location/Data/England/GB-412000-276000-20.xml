		<title>20A Solihull Health Food Shop.</title>
		<content> We visited a{health food shop}which   
 has recently opened. The shop sells   
 vitamin pills, beans and pulses, dried
 fruit, nuts, non meat products and    
 food in which artificial colourings   
 and additives are not used. We were   
 told that more women than men used the
 shop, but people were becoming more   
 aware of the importance of natural    
 food which is not much more expensive 
 than mass produced processed food, and
 much better for you.Mr. George, the   
 owner, said he also sold herbal       
 remedies for people to treat their    
 illnesses the natural way.
