		<content> There are 3 farms near our school in  
 Marshalswick.{Oak Farm}is an all      
 arable farm and the crops grown are   
 oil seed rape, barley and winter      
 wheat.{Beech Farm}was a mixed dairy   
 and arable farm but now it is entirely
 arable. Mr. Letts is the farm manager 
 and has worked there for 2 yrs. He    
 looks after the crops and does odd    
 jobs around the farm. The farm is also
 part of St. Albans Sand and Gravel Co.
{Nashes Farm}is owned by Mr. Sherriff. 
 It is a mixed farm covering 214.5     
 hectares. Wheat, barley, oats and     
 field beans are grown. Since the      
 Jersey Farm Estate has been built lots
 of sparrows come to eat the crops.    
 Cattle are also kept. Each cow has a  
 calf and adopts a second one to look  
 after. Mr. Sherriff enters his bulls  
 into a lot of competitions and they   
 often win.                            </content>
