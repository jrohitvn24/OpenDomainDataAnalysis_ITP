		<content> In our family my brother has to get up
 at 7:00 in the morning and gets       
 dressed.He goes down the stairs and   
 has his breakfast.Then he sits down in
 the armchair and watchs T.V. He has to
 catch the bus at 8:00 so he goes down 
 to the square at 7:50 , then he will  
 be in time to catch the bus.I get up  
 at 8:00 get dressed and go down stairs
 to have my breakfast.When I have had  
 my breakfast I have to take the dog   
 for a walk.That takes quarter of an   
 hour so I'm just in time for school.  
 On Saturdays and Sundays we usually   
 get up about 10am and have our        
 breakfast at 10:30.For the rest of the
 day we usually find something to do or
 we go out to play.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
