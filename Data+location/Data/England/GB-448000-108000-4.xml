		<content> to the public.Before the second World 
 War the the hard and foreshore was    
 just mud &amp; marsh right up to the road,
 but during the War the American forces
 reclaimed what is now the hard and    
 used it to repair their patron landing
 craft.                                
 Today the foreshore is fronted by a   
 carpark and a stony area with benches 
 were people can sit and watch the busy
 activity of the river .At the entrance
 of the carpark a poster warns of      
 rabies,a precution which must be taken
 in all ports and seafronts areas.     
                                       
 Visitors can sit on the hard ,and     
 watch the boats,going up and down the 
 river.                                
 The dinghies stored in the foreshore  
 pound balong mostly to Hamble river   
 Sailing Club members but still        
 permission must be obtained           </content>
