The primary school in this area known  
as Draycott-in-the-Moors is Draycott   
Manor County Primary School. Children  
aged between 4 and 11 attend this      
school of about 100 pupils. Currently  
in the year beginning September 1985   
there are 4.5 staff including the      
headmaster Mr.M.Clark and the deputy   
Mr.R.Rawson.                           
                                       
During these difficult times of falling
school rolls it seems that Draycott    
Manor has reached its minimum number of
pupils. The signs are that there will  
be a slow increase over the next few   
years.
