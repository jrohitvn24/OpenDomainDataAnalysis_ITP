		<title>04TRANSPORT PROBLEMS IN HANLEY</title>
		<content>In Hanley's town centre the one-way    
system has been congested because the  
Severn-Trent Water Authority have been 
laying new water mains.They have partly
been laid because of the Eastern Bypass
under construction.The route of this   
new road can now clearly be seen       
because of the derelictions,demolition 
and destruction.There are a lot of     
fumes,smoke and dust from the rubble   
and it is putting a different          
atmosphere into Hanley.Terraced homes  
have disappeared.The birthplace of     
Captain Smith of the Titanic in Jasper 
Street has been demolished and the home
of Reginald Mitchell the Spitfire      
designer.History is disappearing.      
Some people believe the new road will  
help traffic and pedestrians in the    
city centre, while others look on and  
wonder.                                
                                       </content>
