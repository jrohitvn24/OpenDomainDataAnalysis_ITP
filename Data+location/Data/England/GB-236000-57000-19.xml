		<title>19TREMATON WATER SUPPLY</title>
		<content> Trematon seems to have changed little 
 in size for centuries.There are houses
 dating from medieval times and others 
 rebuilt on earlier foundations.One of 
 the restricting factors to growth was 
 the supply of water.Trematon Hall,1800
 had its water pumped from a stream by 
 an{hydraulic ram}which also supplied a
 few neighbouring homes until the      
 advent of piped water.The main source 
 of water for the village was a well,  
 still standing by the road.By the well
 is a notice -{"Privately owned well   
{used  by the people of Trematon by    
{courtesy of the owner prior to the    
{supply of piped water in 1957".}Since 
 then a few houses have been built     
 including 15 bungalows in Townswell   
 Close.However even with the{holding   
{tank at Winston Beacon}the water      
 pressure is low,there will be no more 
 building in the foreseeable future.   </content>
