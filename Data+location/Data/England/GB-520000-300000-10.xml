		<title>10EYE BYPASS 2</title>
		<content> The Government doesn't want the bypass
 to go the South route because they    
  ill have to pay the farmers for their
 land, lay their own foundations and   
 the route is longer. People who have  
 houses next to the railway track don't
 want it to go the North route because 
 the by pass will be right next to     
 their house. My friend ,Matthew       
 Bagster , has a gate leading out on to
 the railway track. If the pass is made
 via the North route, I don't think he 
 will want to open his gate to a main  
 road. The bypass might even be a Dual 
 carriageway. So these are the         
 arguments and questions about the     
 bypass for{Eye.}The people of{Eye }are
 in suspense until August when the     
 government will decide which way the  
 by pass should go.
