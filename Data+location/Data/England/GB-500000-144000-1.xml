		<content>    Our area is mainly farmland and it 
 includes the villages of              
 Bramley,Blackheath and Wonersh.       
    We have several hills,the highest  
 of which is called Chinthurst Hill.   
 It is 394 feet above sea level.Much of
 the other land is grazing or woodland.
 This is mainly coniferous.            
    This area is situated 30 miles     
 south-west of London and 3 miles      
 south-east of Guildford.              
    There are many commuters living in 
 the area because our grid is within   
 daily travelling distance of London   
 and Southhampton.                     
    We have an A road passing through  
 Bramley,all the other roads are       
 secondary.                            
    There are six farms and six schools
 in this area.
