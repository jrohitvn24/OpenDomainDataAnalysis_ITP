		<title>14COVENTRY AND ASHBY CANAL</title>
		<content> We spent two afternoons walking the   
 canals to discover the farming done in
 the fields by the canal. We found that
 many hedges have been removed as we   
 were using a map with the old field   
 boundaries marked on it. Our field was
 covered in 'spoil' from the quarry and
 was therfore not farmed. On the other 
 hand some fields which were once      
 quarried, then filled in with rubbish 
 have now been returned to agriculture.
 Using the old field patterns 1 field  
 was ploughed, 9 fields were growing   
 barley, 15 field were grassed, some   
 having horses and cattle in them. 17  
 were wheat. Quarring for granite is   
 still done and has caused very large  
 holes in the ground. There is also    
 evidence of disused canals, which in  
 the past have served the mining       
 industries of the area.
