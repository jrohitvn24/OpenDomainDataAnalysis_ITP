		<title>07The Guides</title>
		<content>  Guides in 1985 is good. We go out on 
lots of trips. Yesterday, 23rd June we 
went to Oxford City football ground to 
celebrate 75 years of Guides. There    
were about 600 people there.On 27th    
June we are having a  party at our     
headquarters.                          
 We meet in the community hall from    
7.00 - 9.00 o'clock every Thursday.    
 Our leaders are called Harry and Mo;  
they are both ladies.                  
 Sometimes we do work for badges but   
most of the time we play games. We go  
out on nature trails, sometimes we are 
sent out to collect leaves, as many    
kinds as possible. The person with the 
most leaves does the drinks and washes 
the cups; most people dont try hard    
because they don't want the job.
