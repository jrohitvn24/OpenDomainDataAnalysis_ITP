		<content> Busk Lane is a busy route from Church 
 Fenton to Ulleskelf and beyond,passing
 the main gate of R.A.F.Church Fenton. 
 The military base,after a dormant     
 period,was reactivated about 6 years  
 ago,which led to an increase in       
 traffic. Over 5 working days per week,
 about 15 tankers deliver jet fuel to  
 the base. In addition,about 85 other  
 vehicles pass through the main gate   
 each week.                            
  Bus service 493 from Pontefract to   
 Tadcaster and York runs along Busk    
 Lane, there are 9 services per weekday
 each way,less on Saturday and none on 
 Sunday. On Mondays only, a private bus
 makes the return trip to Selby for    
 market day. School buses take over    
 11's to Sherburn High School or       
 Tadcaster Grammar and under 11's to   
 Church Fenton primary school.
