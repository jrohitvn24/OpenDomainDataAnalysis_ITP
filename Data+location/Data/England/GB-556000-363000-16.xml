		<title>16Weekend in Skegness</title>
		<content> At the weekend I had a great time. On 
 Friday night I went with the Boys'    
 Brigade to archery lessons. To get a  
 gold you have to shoot the arrow into 
 the middle of the board. Austen got   
 twenty golds and I got seventeen. On  
 the last lesson the man said that we  
 would be having a  competition.       
 When I got back from archery lessons I
 went to the caravan site to see my    
 friends. I had supper there and went  
 home.                                 
 In the evening my brother Simon,      
 Sanchica, Ann-Marie, Samantha and I   
 went to the pictures. We went to see A
 VIEW TO A KILL. It was a bit far      
 fetched because there was an office   
 that turned into an air balloon. Next 
 Saturday I am going to see Police     
 Academy 2. On Sunday I played         
 football.                             
                                       </content>
