		<content> grows it's leaf &amp; stem in the light   
 days of the year, &amp; only forms it'S   
 bud &amp; flower as the days begin to get 
 shorter &amp; darker. Therefore 2 of the  
 controls we use to flower crops A,Y,R,
 are light &amp; darkness.the light being  
 ordinary electric light bulbs which   
 are switched on to give a long summer 
 day &amp; make the plants think it's      
 spring &amp; summer so the plants would   
 grow leaf &amp; stem only,&amp; would not     
 flower. The second control is darkness
 and the way we make it dark is by     
 drawing across a curtain &amp; switching  
 off the lights,which would then make  
 the plants think it was a short winter
 day and it would start to form a bud &amp;
 eventually a flower. you can see from 
 this that you cangrow a flower that   
 can be cut any day or date of a 365   
 day year by the use of light which    
 will give the length of stem desired  </content>
