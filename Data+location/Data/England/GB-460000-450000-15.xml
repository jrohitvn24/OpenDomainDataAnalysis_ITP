		<content> HORSERIDING.  EMMA BEDDINGTON. AGED 10
      In my free time I enjoy going    
 horseriding.  I have my own pony and  
 my friend and I ride together.  We go 
 in a car to the riding school.  On a  
 typical day our riding teacher might  
 be taking a pony into the stables when
 we arrive.  One of the girls who works
 there taks Tommy, my horse, out of the
 stable and helps me mount.  Our       
 instructor gives me hints as we ride. 
 Usually towards the end of the lesson 
 we jump our fences.  When we do Tommy 
 takes firm charge and goes over the   
 jumps TWO AT A TIME!  He is a golden  
 colour called Palomino.  We ride for  
 an hour, then dismount and return our 
 ponies to the stables.  I remove      
 Tommy's saddle and bridle. Often he   
 tris to squash me against the wall.
