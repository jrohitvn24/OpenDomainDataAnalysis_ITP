		<title>12STIBBINGTON AREA TRAFFIC</title>
		<content>  The major traffic feature of this    
 area is the A1 trunk road which skirts
 the village of Stibbington.           
  The A1 is extremely busy day and     
 night. On average 290 vehicles travel 
 south along the road every fifteen    
 minutes. The twenty five kilometre    
 stretch of road between Stamford to   
 the north and Sawtry to the south is a
 well known accident blackspot area.   
  Most villagers in this area own cars 
 but there is little traffic congestion
 as most cars are garaged and people   
 use them for going to work.           
  The village of Ailsworth was by far  
 the busiest of the four villages      
 because it lies alongside the A47     
 which is the major route from the A1  
 to Peterborough, and also from the    
 East Midlands to the ports of the East
 coast.
