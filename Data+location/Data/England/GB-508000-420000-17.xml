		<title>17GOXHILL PLAYING FIELD.</title>
		<content> The Playing Field is next to the      
 school at North End. It is a long     
 narrow strip of land just over the    
 width of a football pitch. In its     
 length two football pitches could be  
 fitted. The narrow entry to the field 
 is from the car park outside the      
 school's gates. The field has had a   
 football pitch and a children's slide,
 witch's hat, climbing frame, swings   
 and rocking horse on it. The Goxhill  
 Playing Fields Association has        
 recently been formed and they are     
 using the Barton Community Programme  
 Scheme workers to put in a BMX Fun    
 Track near the entry to the field.    
 This is incomplete but so far loads of
 earth have been brought in; the turf  
 removed from the field for the track; 
 upright tyres put in to the ground to 
 make the edges of the first part of   
 the track.                            </content>
