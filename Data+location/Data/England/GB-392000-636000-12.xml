 now used as a field study centre,part 
 of the Outdoor Education Service      
 serving schools from Northumberland,

 Over 1800 children ,mainly 14-18 years
 old,stay at the castle in a year and  
 undertake field work in mainly        
 Geography,Biology and Environmental   
 Studies. The wide range of            
 habitats,historical sites and areas of
 geographical interest close to the    
 castle, from coast to                 
 mountains,and the layout of the castle
 buildings make it ideally suited for  
 use as a field study centre.At        
 weekends the Castle is used as a      
 residential venue for in-service      
 training courses and conferences for  
 Northumberland's teachers.1500 adults 
 stay every year.                      </content>
