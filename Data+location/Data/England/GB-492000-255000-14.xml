 There has been a bridge over the River
 Ouse at Harrold since Roman times. The
 present bridge dates back to the l3th.
 century.                              
 In the middle part of the bridge are  
 four arches.Each arch was the         
 responsibility of the Lord of the     
 Manor of each of the parishes which   
 met at the bridge, viz.Odell,         
 Chellington, Carlton and Harrold.     
 The arches of the first three villages
 were made of stone and pointed; that  
 of Harrold was wooden and square..!   
 Nowadays the bridge carries much      
 traffic and traffic lights have had to
 be installed.
