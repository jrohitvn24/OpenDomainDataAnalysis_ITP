		<title>10St Nicholas Church,Britwell</title>
		<content> Britwell's place of worship is St     
 Nicholas Church, which was rebuilt in 
 1867 on the site of a Norman church.  
 it is made of brick and flint and it  
 has a bell tower on the roof.  The    
 Rector now is Reverend Membury.  There
 have been forty nine rectors since    
 1234.  The first incumbent was Warin  
 de Schirebourne.  The earlist date for
 someone to be buried in the graveyard 
 was in 1574.  He was called Mr Browne.
 He had seventen children.  Some of his
 children did not survive to the age of
 six.  Nowadays hardly anyone goes to  
 church on a Sunday.  Mr Membury said  
 the conregation is only six, but there
 is a service every Sunday.  Mr Membury
 has only been a Rector for three      
 years.  Before he became a Rector he  
 was a worker priest in industrial     
 training, a headmaster for seventeen  
 years and a missionary for eleven year</content>
