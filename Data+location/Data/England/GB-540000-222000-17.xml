		<content>   UPP HALL                            
                                       
  Upp Hall probably has the largest    
 amount of ghosts in this area they    
 range from malignant poltergeists to  
 harmless apparitions which roam the   
 hall undetected.                      
  Perhaps the most bizzare and         
 frightening happenings occur in the   
 kitchen which involves a ghost which  
 lifts kitchen utensils such as knives 
 and cleavers into the air and hurls   
 them around the kitchen when anyone is
 present.                              
  There is also, in one of the         
 bedrooms, a ghost which was bricked up
 behind the fireplace because her      
 husband wanted to keep her from the   
 outside world. This ghost is said to  
 be heard moaning some nights.
