		<title>18RISELEY OVER SIXTY CLUB</title>
		<content>      The club is simple,unpretentious,
 and open to all members of the village
 who have reached the qualifying age!  
 Its aim is to provide a monthly get   
 together with some form of            
 entertainment. Typical recent examples
 have been a talk on antique musical   
 boxes,a visit by a singing group of   
 school masters from Bedford School,and
 a Derby Day Special,at which other    
 staid members of the committee acted  
 as bookmakers and tic-tac men.  There 
 is an annual summer coach outing,and a
 Christmas Party.                      
      Volunteer helpers supply tea,and 
 the club raises money by bring and buy
 sales and a store at the village      
 bazaar selling a wide range of items  
 made by members.A mixture of self-help
 and local support,including generous  
 help from the five bells darts players
 enables club to stay finacially able. </content>
