		<content> This is the first ruralarea south of  
 London. Three quarters is in Surrey   
 the rest in Kent. The southern slope  
 of the North Downs is mainly covered  
 by deciduous woodland. The more       
 fertile valley, on the lower Greensand
 is partially cultivated but mainly    
 grassland.                            
 There is a small residential area, a  
 corner of Limpsfield, a peripheral    
 dormitory area of London, other       
 scatterd houses are mainly linked to 6
 farms. One large Esatate, the Titsey  
 Foundation Charitable Trust has       
 woodland walks open to the public.    
 Close to the A25 is a group of        
 industrial firms producing, sand,     
 mortar and roofing tiles. Recently a  
 firm has been drilling to determine   
 the extent of an oilfield discovered  
 near Godstone.
