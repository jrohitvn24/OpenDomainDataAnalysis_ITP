		<title>03Farming in Stevington</title>
		<content> Of the seven farms in Stevington four 
 are solely arable.One farm combines   
 growing barley and wheat with the     
 rearing of beef cattle,having at this 
 moment sixty Charolais cows.There is a
 herd of fifty-four Aberdeen Angus beef
 cattle and thirty-five ewes plus ram  
 on another smaller farm.The greatest  
 variety in the farming line is carried
 on by the only pig breeder in the     
 village.As of now the pig unit        
 consists of thirty breeding sows and  
 their piglets and gilts making up two 
 hundred and ten animals in all.As well
 as wheat and barley this farmer goes  
 in for market gardening,growing crops 
 of brussels sprouts,runner beans,     
 leeks,sprouting broccoli and potatoes.
 Three farmers from neighbouring       
 villages also own fairly small amounts
 of land in Stevington.
