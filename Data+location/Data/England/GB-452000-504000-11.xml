		<content>      Today my alarm woke me up as I   
 had just started to nod off. Pulling  
 back my sheets, I stumbled out of     
 bed, went downstairs in my nightie    
 and opened the door to the kitchen. A 
 sunny{Monday morning}met my eyes. A   
 piece of toast popped out the toaster 
 which I buttered and ate. Upstairs I  
 went and changed into my jeans and    
 jumper. Normally I would put on my    
 school clothes but today there was no 
 school. Downstairs I packed a picnic. 
      11.00 and we were picked up to   
 go to the point_to_point. Passing     
 Burtree Caravan Centre,we turned into 
 the road,and saw people eating lollies
 which made me feel hungry. Inside at  
 last with food and drink in front of  
 me. The voice of the man on the       
 mircophone boomed out. After the      
 races, we looked at the car boot sale.
 Then the journey home was set ahead.  </content>
