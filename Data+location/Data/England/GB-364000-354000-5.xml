		<title>05A village policeman.</title>
		<content> We interviewed a policeman from       
 Worleston. He starts duty at different
 times everyday. He wears a navy blue  
 uniform and a pale blue shirt. In the 
 summer if the weather is hot he is    
 allowed to take off his jacket and    
 roll his shirt sleeves up. On his     
 uniform he wears his idenity number   
 3213. He drives a police van which has
 radios and accident equipment in it.  
 He is responsible for patrolling 3,000
 acres. The main crime is burglary     
 which happens mostly at night. His    
 office is a room in his police house  
 so people can contact him easily.He   
 does not have a police dog but if he  
 needs one he radios for a dog and dog 
 handler. A country policeman has to   
 deal with criminals like poachers and 
 vandals who do not obey the country   
 code. He sometimes has to help the    
 town policemen.                       </content>
