		<title>17KILLIGREW SCHOOLS</title>
		<content> There are two schools sharing the same
 site in{Chiswell Green.}One caters for
 aged 5-7 children and the other is the
 junior section for children up to 11  
 years. The name of{'Killigrew'}was    
 adopted when a combined school moved  
 from St.Stephens church hall to a new 
 site in Chiswell Green. Admiral       
 Killigrew had been a resident in the  
 area in the past although the family  
 moved to Devon and formed much        
 stronger connections there. There is  
 an active{parents association}which   
 raises funds for both schools through 
 a variety of social events to appeal  
 to both children and adults alike.In  
 past years they have provided the     
 money for an open air{swimming pool}in
 the school grounds which is in        
 constant use during the holiday when  
 it remains open for family use.
