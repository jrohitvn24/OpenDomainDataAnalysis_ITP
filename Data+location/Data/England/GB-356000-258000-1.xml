		<content> Reaching 600ft at its highest point,  
 this area occasionally becomes        
 inaccessible in bad winter weather.   
 Primarily a farming area, the         
 population however now includes a     
 number of people commuting to nearby  
 towns and cities, and some retired    
 professionals. There are some good    
 examples of church, domestic and      
 agricultural architecture from the    
 15th, 18th and 19th Centuries. Many   
 previously rather poor dwellings have 
 been pleasantly and well converted to 
 a good modern standard.  The          
 population has remained much the same 
 numerically for many centuries, but   
 unfortunately a lack of young children
 within recent years has made the small
 primary schools unviable. There is    
 travelling involved for all services, 
 the majority being by private car.
