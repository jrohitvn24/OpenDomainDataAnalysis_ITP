		<title>11GARTREE PRISON_FOXTON</title>
		<content> H.M.Prison Gartree was opened as a    
 category C prison in 1966.It was built
 on a former R.A.F.airfield.           
 In 1972 it became a maximum security  
 prison.This meant that with the       
 construction of a wall and the        
 addition of close circuit T.V.cover   
 +dog patrols Gartree was equipped to  
 hold some of Britain's most notorious 
 criminals.                            
 The current population is 304         
 including 47 "high risk"prisoners.Over
 a third of the total population are   
 serving Life sentences.               
 The prison has its own education      
 block,hospital,workshops,playing      
 fields,gymnasium and church.Each      
 inmate has a single cell.Indeed apart 
 from no freedom inmates do have a     
 better standard of life than some     
 people outside the wall.
