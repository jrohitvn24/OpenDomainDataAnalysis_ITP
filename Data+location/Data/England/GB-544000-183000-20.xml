		<title>20THE DOMESDAY SURVEY</title>
		<content>   To begin, our teacher, Mr. Gunn,    
 explained what we would be doing, then
 we got into the mini-bus. There were  
 13 pupils from my class and 2         
 teachers-Mr. Gunn and Mr. Jacobson.   
 When we got to the right place we were
 given count-sheets and split into     
 groups. My group had to count all the 
 recreation facilities like parks and  
 sports grounds. We used a photo-copied
 map and walked around the area we were
 surveying; two of us looked for the   
 things we wanted to count and the     
 other one wrote down what we saw.     
   At the end of this all the groups   
 came back and we returned to school.  
 In the class we entered the numbers   
 onto a master sheet. Another class    
 will use these numbers to enter them  
 onto the computer, then everything    
 will be sent away to the BBC.
