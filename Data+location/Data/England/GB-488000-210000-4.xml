		<content>   In the southern part of our area we 
 have at least two square kilometres of
 woodland consisting of a mixture of   
 deciduous and coniferous trees.       
   The Norway Spruce is the main       
 coniferous tree,it has many uses      
 including paper pulp, ladders sides   
 and rafters. Larch is used for railway
 sleepers and fencing.                 
   The beech is the main deciduous     
 tree. It is a large strong tree       
 growing up to 30 metres tall.         
   In Aston Clinton there are a lot of 
 trees and plant life. At Green Park   
 there are some wild flowers which you 
 can see along the nature trail. Behind
 the Sports Complex some young horse   
 chestnut saplings are growing. As you 
 go down the entrance to the           
 Complex there are Wellingtonias, with 
 red spongy bark. As you walk down the 
 various roads you see many flowers.   </content>
