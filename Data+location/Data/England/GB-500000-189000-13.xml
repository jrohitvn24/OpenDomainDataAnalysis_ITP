		<content>Part of the old Chalfont Estate situ-  
ated near the Misbourne, the plant is  
centred around the old Manor House     
currently being renovated.Part of a    
Canadian company operating worldwide,  
it employs 300 local staff mainly doing
research.There are 3 main groups of    
research:development and quality       
control of foils and metallic          
materials;additive of aluminium oxides 
to various products ie polishing com-  
pounds,china,glass,spark plugs,ceramic 
colours and glazes to give increased   
hardness;the latest line of research is
the additive of aluminium hydroxide as 
a fire retardant and smoke suppressant 
in carpets,rubbers,plastics,cable      
coverings and motor vehicle components.
One disadvantage at the moment is that 
the additive makes the product brittle,
further research is being continued.
