		<content> If going to church is considered to be
 a middle class activity then this     
 could explain the poor attendance at  
 the areas three churches, being       
 essentially working class. Iwade,     
 Bobbing and Milton are ecclesiastical 
 parishes, but only Milton has its own 
 vicar, who has maintained isolation by
 refusing to be combined with another  
 parish. Meanwhile, the satisfactory   
 grouping of Iwade, Newington and      
 Bobbing was ended three years ago in  
 1982 resulting in the pastoral care of
 Iwade becoming the charge of a vicar  
 of a Sittinbourne parish, with Bobbing
 being in a similar position. The three
 churches are magnificient buildings of
 the 11th and 13th centuries, needing a
 lot of maintenance which is a heavy   
 burden on the small congregations. The
 population would claim to be mainly   
 Church of England.                    </content>
