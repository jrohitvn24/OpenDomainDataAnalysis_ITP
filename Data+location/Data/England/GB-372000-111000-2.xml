		<content>   Blink twice and you have missed the 
 village which is either side of half a
 mile of the A357.The village is       
 approached from the east by crossing  
 the{River Lydden,}marking the boundary
 between Bagber and Lydlinch,via an    
 18th-century stone bridge.This is one 
 of several in the county bearing a    
 warning plaque which states that      
                                       
   " ANY PERSON WILFULLY INJURING ANY  
  PART OF THIS COUNTY BRIDGE WILL BE   
  GUILTY OF FELONY AND UPON CONVICTION 
  LIABLE TO BE TRANSPORTED FOR LIFE    
  BY THE COURT                         
                         T.FOOKS "     
                                       
   To help preserve the bridge, an     
 ungainly metal bailey bridge has been 
 erected alongside it taking the       
 traffic travelling eastwards.
