		<content>    In the 1950's the main change on   
 the farms was that horses were        
 superceded by the mechanical age.     
 Instead of the farmer having horses   
 and employing grooms the farmer now   
 had tractors and tractor men. The work
 of twenty farm labourers was now done 
 by three, which accounted for the     
 decrease in village population at this
 period. Many of the young men of the  
 village went into industry after their
 National Service. The only horses seen
 in the village were used mainly for   
 hunting and pleasure. Though there was
 a horse drawn carrier's van which     
 travelled to Cheltenham three times a 
 week, taking three hours to get there 
 and four hours for the return journey,
 which was uphill. Even this stopped   
 when the new coach service started    
 late in the 1950's.
