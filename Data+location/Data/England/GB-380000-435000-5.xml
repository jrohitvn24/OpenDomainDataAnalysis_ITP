		<title>05SHOPS IN FENCE</title>
		<content>    Fence village is a very quiet and  
 boring place.Apart from the bypass,it 
 is well away from noise and industry. 
  As it's name suggests, Fence was     
 once the border to the Forest of      
 Pendle in which the King kept his     
 deer.The village has 3 shops,churches 
 and pubs.Fence is surrounded on       
 three sides by beautiful countryside  
 with the equally pretty villages of   
 Barley and Newchurch near by.The      
 village has a Green Slate shop, a     
 H.A.P.P.A. &lt;Horse and Ponies          
 Protection Association>,a Sports Club 
 and a small park.When standing outside
 the old mill,looking down the village 
 you can see where the old Co Op once  
 was and where the Post Office         
 is.Looking up the village you are able
 to see the Village Shop which sells   
 sweets,alcohol and some groceries.You 
 can also see the Methodist Chapel.    </content>
