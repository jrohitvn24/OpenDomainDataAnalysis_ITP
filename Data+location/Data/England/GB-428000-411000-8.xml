		<content> Bretton Hall once belonged to a rich  
 family called the Beaumonts.It is a   
 big house with a park around it.      
 In 1949 it was sold to the West Riding
 County Council to become a college of 
 the arts.There are eight hundred      
 students working there at the         
 moment.Some are going to be           
 teachers.Others are studying arts     
 subjects like painting, music and     
 drama, and taking other short courses.
     We met Mr. Pearce, a lecturer, in 
 the stable block and sat round a big  
 table to ask questions. Then we went  
 for a walk in the park.We ran through 
 the long grass by the lake and onto   
 a bridge.We went back through the     
 Yorkshire Sculpture Park and saw some 
 of the sculptures.
