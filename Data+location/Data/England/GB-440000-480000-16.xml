		<title>16Thirsk Auction Mart</title>
		<content> Thirsk Auction Mart is one of the     
 largest one-day marts in Europe. They 
 can now handle about 5OOO animals and 
 they are expanding. The animals and   
 dealers come from all over the        
 country. There are two big selling    
 halls and a show ring. The cattle are 
 driven through a weighbridge into     
 the show ring and are sold separately.
 They are sold at so many pence per    
 kilogramme.The sheep and pigs who also
 go over automatic weighbridges as     
 they enter the hall are sold in pen   
 loads as the auctioneer walks on      
 planks laid over the pens. The        
 auctioneer talks so fast that you can 
 hardly understand him.He sells a cow  
 in about 25 seconds and a pen of sheep
 in about the same time. The buyers bid
 by winking, nodding and by using      
 special signs. {T.Dewar/P.Cruickshank
