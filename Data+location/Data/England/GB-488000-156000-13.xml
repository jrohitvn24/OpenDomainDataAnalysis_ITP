		<title>13Two Schools in Frimley</title>
		<content>   Frimley Green C of E Middle School  
 was opened in 1868 for 88 children    
 from a wide area, as Frimley Green was
 not highly populated then. The need to
 extend, to cater for a much increased 
 population locally, was carefully done
 during the past year to preserve the  
 elegant appearance of the school.     
   There are now 190 pupils aged 8 to  
 12 years. Many sports are played and  
 children learn all subjects, including
 use of the computer at least once a   
 week. Older pupils have one hour's    
 homework each night.                  
   Burrow Hill School, set in 2\ acres 
 of beautiful grounds, is for children 
 with problems at home. Most come from 
 Inner London. The 40 pupils live at   
 school and may go home on alternate   
 weekends and for holidays. Many extra 
 activities, like nature trails, are   
 organised for them at weekends.       </content>
