		<title>19A Typical School Day</title>
		<content> On a typical day at school we have    
three main lessons. The list of the    
week's work is on the notice board and 
we have three of the four areas of:    
Maths, Creative Writing, Project work, 
and Literacy Skills. We have playtime  
at 10:45 to 11:00 and lunch from 12:00 
to 1:15. Home time is 15:30. We have 30
in our class but work in groups of 7or8
 On Wed, we have Hymn Practice at 9:00,
then my group have Maths. We mostly do 
a Maths card and some work in"Fletcher"
books. After play we have Creative     
Writing and might write a story or poem
or letter. On Wed my group have Art and
we might draw some berries that we got 
on the walk or paint or make something.
At 14:00 we have football practice and 
then there is a short time left for a  
story to be read to us before hometime.
 This term's project has been all about
Cogges etc. for the Domesday Survey.   </content>
