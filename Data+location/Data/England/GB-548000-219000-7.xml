		<title>07LIFE IN STORTFORD IN 1939</title>
		<content> Lisa Rowe tells us of a day in the    
 life of her father in 1939.           
 In 1939 my father was 5 years old.    
 This would have been similar to an    
 average day in his life.              
 He would wake up early and with his   
 dog Jock he would collect the eggs on 
 our farmyard. After a fresh egg for   
 breakfast, he would walk the half mile
 into the village to the village       
 school. In winter, if the road was    
 clear enough my father still had to   
 walk there as there were no cars. Dad 
 came home at lunchtime and then went  
 back to school.                       
 At this time we had prisoners of war  
 working on our farm. There were       
 Germans and Italians.                 
 In summer when Dad came back from     
 school he used to get a lift from our 
 carthorses which pulled the haycarts.
