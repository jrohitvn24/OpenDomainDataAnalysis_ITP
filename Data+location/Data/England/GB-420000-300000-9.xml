		<content> Our survey showed that slightly less  
people were going on holiday this      
year than last.The most popular holiday
areas were North Wales and Cornwall.   
Less than one tenth of our survey said 
they were going abroad. The most       
popular resorts were Skegness,Great    
Yarmouth and Weston Super Mare. Most   
people go away in August,usually for a 
week. The majority now travel by car.  
Very few travel by train. We found the 
most popular accommodation was a       
caravan followed by a hotel. We asked  
groups of people where they would go   
for a day out from Tamworth. Amongst   
adults the most popular choices were   
London and York. Amongst children the  
chices were Drayton Manor,Alton Towers 
and Gullivers Kingdom at Matlock.
