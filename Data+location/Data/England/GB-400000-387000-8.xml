		<title>08THE VILLAGE OF ROWARTH</title>
		<content> Rowarth has just one shop and that    
 is a post office.There used to be a   
 church but that was knocked down.It is
 a little countryside village.The      
 Childrens Inn used to be called the   
 Hare and Hounds where coach riders    
 would stop overnight and change their 
 horses for the Manchester to Derby    
 coach road.There is an old monastery  
 which is now a farmhouse.A monk is    
 buried under the floor of the barn.   
   The Hare and Hounds was used until  
 1928 now it is a childrens holiday    
 home.The little mill pub is in Rowarth
 It was once a corn mill.Further up the
 road there is an old water mill but   
 there is no longer a water wheel.There
 is a mill pond which runs smoothly    
 until a fast flowing drop.Lantern Pike
 overlooks Rowarth.There are no trains 
 or buses going to or from Rowarth so  
 you would need your own transport.    </content>
