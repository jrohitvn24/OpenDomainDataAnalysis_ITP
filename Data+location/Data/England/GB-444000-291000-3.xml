		<content>{PIGGY-BACK FIGHT}: This game does not 
 have any rules.You carry someone on   
 your back.Then you knock other similar
 pairs over.The last pair standing are 
 the winners.{                         
{                                      
{FIVES}: You can play with as many     
 people as you like.You need a football
 and some goals.The goalkeeper starts  
 off with seven points and everybody   
 else starts on five.The players have  
 to try and head or volley the ball    
 into the goal.A volley is when you    
 kick the ball without it bouncing     
 first.If they succeed in scoring,the  
 goalkeeper losses one point.However,if
 the players score without it being a  
 volley or a header the person that    
 kicked it is in goal.The same applies 
 if the ball goes wide.When someone    
 gets nought they are out.
