           FRAMPTON                    
 Frampton is considered to be one of   
 the prettiest villages around  Boston.
 The village is grouped arouned the    
 church and consists of private houses,
 Frampton Hall ,a large country house  
 built in 1725,and a public house ,the 
 Moore's Arms. As at Wyberton the      
 village itself has grown only a little
 but has developed rapidly along the   
 Spalding to Boston road whichis beyond
 the limits of this survey.            
 The church was St. Mary was mentioned 
 in the Domesday survey, although it's 
 thought that that church was built of 
 wood.The fine tower with it's early   
 broach spire was built in the twelth  
 century and the remainder of the      
 church was rebuilt in 1310.
