		<title>14RELIGION2 - NORTH TAWTON</title>
		<content>{THE PARISH CHURCH OF ST.PETER.        
 The building is partly{Early English  
 and partly{Perpendicular}in style.    
{The nave}is the earliest part probably
 dating from the{12th. century}while   
 the north and south aisles were added 
 later,between{1340}and{1440.}         
{The Tower}which also probably dates   
 from the{12th. century}is surmounted  
 by an oak shingle truncated{spire.}The
 top of the spire was damaged by a fire
 which swept through the centre of     
 North Tawton in{1834.}                
 The effects of the{Civil War}can be   
 seen;two statues are missing from     
 their niches over the north door and  
 southern wall of the tower and only   
 small pieces of{early stained glass } 
 remain in the north aisle windows.    
 There is a{gallery}in the west end but
 the{screen}was removed in about{1740.}
 Small{vaults}exist beneath the church.</content>
