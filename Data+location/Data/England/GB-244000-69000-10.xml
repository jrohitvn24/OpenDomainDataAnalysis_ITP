		<title>10TAVISTOCK WOODLANDS</title>
		<content> Almost all the woods in this area are 
 managed by{Tavistock Woodlands Estate.
 The owner is{The 7th Earl of Bradford 
 and the manager is{Roy Dyer.}43 people
 work on the estate.In our area there  
 are about 100 hectares of woodland but
 the estate is much larger.            
{  }In our area there are both         
 deciduous and coniferous woodland.The 
 main species are Beech,Douglas Fir,   
 Western Red Cedar,Larch,Scots Pine,   
 Western Hemlock and Oak.About 30,000  
 trees a year are cut down and 70,000  
 planted.                              
   A new saw mill has just been opened.
 Most of the wood is sold to farmers   
 and builders.                         
  {Mr.Dyer }said that the worst problem
 is rabbits.At Christmas some trees    
 are stolen.There are also many old    
 mine shafts in the woods.
