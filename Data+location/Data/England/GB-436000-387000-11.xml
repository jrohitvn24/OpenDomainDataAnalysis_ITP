		<content>   Grimesthorpe Road follows the line  
 of a Roman road from Buxton to Don-   
 caster, passing through nearby Winco- 
 bank Hill, the site of a{Roman}hill   
 fort, and an earlier Iron-age fort.   
  {Grimesthorpe}takes its name from a  
 later Norse settlement. In Victorian  
 times terraced housing was built in   
 the area to house workers from the    
 local steel wirks.For many years there
 was a close knit community with its   
 own pubs, primary school and shops.   
   In 1972 a new middle school was     
 opened to replace the old village     
 school and gradually most of the      
 housing was cleared to create a{green-
{belt}between houses and factories. A  
 new private estate has been built     
 around the new school and a few small 
 factory units have also been built    
 nearby.
