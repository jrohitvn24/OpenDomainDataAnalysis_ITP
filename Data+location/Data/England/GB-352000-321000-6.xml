		<content>{The parish church of St.Mary the      
{Virgin}was built by the Normans in the
 early 12th century using stone from   
{Grinshill quarry.                     
  We read in the Domesday book that    
 there was a church and a{priest}in    
 Shawbury and we believe the present   
 church was built on the same site.This
 site is in the centre of the village. 
 The church is in the{diocese of       
{Lichfield.                            
  Later in the 14th century a new      
 chancel was built and a new tower at  
 the west end.Not long ago the church  
 bells were restored after being left  
 for 50 years.                         
  In 1985 there is one priest and a    
 deacon.On Sundays at 8.00am the       
 celebration of the holy{Eucharist}    
 takes place and a sung Eucharist is at
 11.00am.                              
                                       </content>
