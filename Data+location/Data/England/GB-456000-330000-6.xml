		<content> In{RUDDINGTON}there are many different
 sports clubssuch as {Football, Bowls, 
{Athletics, Boxing, Tennis, Badminton. 
 Some of them practice in{ELMS PARK}and

  My name is Louise Kenton and I go to 
 the Athletic Club.You can do lots of  
 things such as high and long jump,    
 hurdles,discus and shot putt.You can  
 go running round the track and do     
 exercises.You can buy Sports clothes  
 like track suits and spikes from Mrs. 
 Sayers. It costs just three pounds to 
 be a member.Its on Tuesdays from      
 5.45p.m. to 7.00p.m. and on Sundays   
 from 10.00a.m. to 11.14a.m.           
 I enjoy the high jump and the long    
 jump most of all. {
