 Bickleigh, well publicised as a       
 tourist attraction, provides, in the  
 complex of buildings at the bridge, a 
 photographer's delight. Guests from   
 all over the world stay at Bickleigh  
 Cottage Guest House. Americans favour 
 it, but a typical June page from the  
 visitors' book might well include     
 entries from India, Australia, Chile, 
 Korea and Austria. The Fisherman's Cot
 Hotel is much enlarged from the       
 original cottages of the turn of the  
 century; there are now 20 bedrooms    
 (more planned) and 2 dining rooms. The
 Trout Inn, also thatched, has a con-  
 tinuous history as a village hostelry.
 Bickleigh Mill is a museum, farm and  
 craft centre, preserving traditional  
 activities and animal breeds from     
 loss.
