		<title>15ALLESLEY HALL</title>
		<content> A house has existed in Allesley Park  
 since the 17th century although       
 tradition suggests that a castle      
 originally stood on the site, but was 
 destroyed by fire in 1146.            
                                       
 Thomas Flynn built the first (Allesley
 Hall) on the present site in 1660. His
 wife, who inherited the hall, sold    
 everything including the hall, the    
 park and property in the village of   
 Allesley to Henry Neale in 1692. Neale
 added a new entrance and drive to the 
 hall. Later the hall became a boys'   
 boarding school.                      
                                       
 At the beginning of this century the  
 hall was in possession of the Iliffe  
 family. In 1910 W. Iliffe altered the 
 house considerably with the addition  
 of gables and chimneys.
