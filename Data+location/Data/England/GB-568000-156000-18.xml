		<title>18A Playground Game - Kent</title>
		<content> One of the games we play in the school
 playground is called Colour Bulldogs. 
 To play this game you have to have two
 lines a few metres apart with one     
 person who is IT in the middle and all
 the other people who are playing      
 standing just behind one of the lines.
 The person who is IT calls out a      
 colour, say Pink, and anyone who is   
 wearing either Pink clothes or shoes  
 can walk straight across to the other 
 side without being had. Anyone who    
 hasn't any Pink on, has to get to the 
 other side quickly without being      
 caught. If they are caught then they  
 are also IT and there are now two     
 people IT. They then choose another   
 colour and start again.
