		<content>{HORSE ACTIVITIES}It is not an ideal   
 area for horse riding. Twisting narrow
 lanes and large farm machinery make   
 the lanes dangerous. There is only one
 bridleway and this is in deep mud in  
 Winter. The Leonard family keep four  
 horses and take part in Pony Club     
 activities.They employ a part-time    
 groom.                                
{EAST HOATHLY FOOTBALL CLUB}Mr.A.Jenner
 runs the football club. They play 28  
 matches a year, Mrs.Fairhurst coaches 
 them. The Football Team is also the   
 Cricket Team. There has been a club   
 for 100 years now, playing 2          
 tournaments a year, one for juniors   
 and one for the men.                  
{CRICKET}The Cricket Club was founded  
 in 1759, 37 years before the          
 foundation of the M.C.C. All matches  
 are "friendlies" against nearby       
 village teams.There is a Junior side. </content>
