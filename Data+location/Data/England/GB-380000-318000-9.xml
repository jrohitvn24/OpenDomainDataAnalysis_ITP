		<title>09The role of the vicar</title>
		<content>  The vicar has the responsibility for 
the life and work of the church in the 
parish. He helps to lead the worship of
the congregation in church. He teaches 
the people the Christian faith and     
prepares them for confirmation. Also he
conducts services of baptism, holy     
matrimony and burial. He visits the    
sick and old people in their homes and 
takes them Holy Communion.             
  He goes to two schools in the parish 
to take their assemblies and he serves 
on their governing bodies. People in   
hospital in Stafford are visited. The  
vicar helps with various organisations 
both within and outside the church.    
  The vicar's role in the community is 
quite important and he represents the  
church within the community and helps  
the church to give service to the      
community. The church is concerned     
about unemployment and violence.       </content>
