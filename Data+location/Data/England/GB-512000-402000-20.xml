		<content> first human victim - a mason working  
 on a monument.                        
    The farmer said that one morning   
 the mason came across the  field to   
 chip off a piece of the stone sack for
 a souvenir because he would be going  
 away after finishing the building of  
 Pelham's Pillar.                      
    He came in the morning, took his   
 memento and went back to put the      
 pinnacle on the tower which was to be 
 finished. Suddenly he fell from the   
 top and killed himself. Incidently or 
 ironically, the dictionary definition 
 of memento is ' reminder that death   
 must come '.                          
    A few years ago a man from the     
 local frozen food factory came and    
 took a piece off and he was injured   
 that same day when they were moving   
 the viners.Later that day he was      
 injured in a road traffic accident!   </content>
