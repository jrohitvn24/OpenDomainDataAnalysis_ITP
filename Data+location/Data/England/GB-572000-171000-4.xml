		<content> Woods.It therefore makes owning a car 
 essential to most residents living    
 away from the two bus routes.         
  Employment in the area is limited to 
 work on the nearby farms and some     
 seasonal work on the fruit farms.The  
 Barracks employs about 300 civilians. 
 Most people who live in the area      
 either work in the Medway towns or    
 commute to London.Up to recently a    
 large number were employed at the BP  
 Oil refinery mentioned earlier or at  
 Chatham Dockyard.Both these major     
 establishments have now closed down.  
 Education on the Hoo Peninsula was re-
 organised in 1977.The Primary schools 
 in the area are now 5-9 First Schools,
 one at Chattenden and one at Cliffe   
 Woods which also has a Middle School. 
 Chattenden children transfer to Hoo   
 Middle School.All the Middle Schools  
 feed the Hoo 13-18 Upper School.      </content>
