		<title>03Raithby Village.</title>
		<content>    I live in Raithby, a small village 
 situated two miles from the market    
 town of Spilsby. There are no shops   
 left in the village now, but there    
 used to be a post office, a bakers    
 shop, a laundry and a blacksmith's    
 forge.                                
    It is not very long ago that       
 everybody who lived in the village    
 also worked here. Most people used    
 either to work on the estate for the  
 squire or on one of the two farms. The
 others worked in the shops. Today,    
 everybody works outside Raithby except
 the two farmers.                      
    There is in the village a church,a 
 chapel, an inn and a village hall that
 used to be the old school.            
    I live in a big house which was    
 converted from a barn in a farm yard  
 The yard is now our garden.
