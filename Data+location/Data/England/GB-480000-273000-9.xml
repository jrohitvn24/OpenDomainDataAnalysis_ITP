		<title>09THE CORNER SHOP,BROUGHTON</title>
		<content>ON FRIDAY, 28th JUNE WE INTERVIEWED    
THE NEW OWNER OF THE CORNER SHOP.HE    
HAS WORKED IN OTHER SHOPS LIKE         
NEWSAGENTS, GROCERIES AND CONFECTIONERY
SHOPS.A LADY OWNED THE SHOP BEFORE     
THE PRESENT OWNER AND HIS WIFE.THE     
NEW OWNER DOES NOT LIKE MUCH ABOUT HIS 
JOB.HE HAS HAD THE SHOP FOR            
FIVE AND A HALF MONTHS.IT OPENS AT     
8.00a.m. AND CLOSES AT 9.00p.m.EXCEPT  
SUNDAY,WHEN IT OPENS AT 9a.m.IT IS     
OPEN EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR EXCEPT      
CHRISTMAS DAY.THEY SELL LOTS OF        
EVERYTHING. THE BUSIEST DAY IS SUNDAY  
BECAUSE THE OTHER SHOPS ARE CLOSED.THE 
LEAST BUSY DAY IS WEDNESDAY BECAUSE    
MANY CUSTOMERS ARE PAID ON THURSDAY SO 
THEY HAVE NOT GOT MUCH MONEY LEFT BY   
WEDNESDAY.THE WORST PROBLEMS ARE:      
SHOPLIFTING AND OLD PEOPLE BEING       
FUSSY.THE ITEMS THAT ARE STOLEN MOST   
ARE SWEETS AND CHOCOLATE.              </content>
