		<content> Although some of the farms in the area
 have been passed down in families     
 there is now only a small proportion  
 of residents born in the area.        
 Most people with jobs have to travel  
 to Ripon or Harrogate.                
 There is a transient group of young   
 professional families taking advantage
 of the good Primary school and        
 catchment area for Ripon Grammar      
 School.                               
 There are many retired people enjoying
 the good housing and pleasant quiet   
 country atmosphere.                   
 A large minority of houses are        
 occupied by one person as these       
 elderly people gradually die, although
 the average age of retirement is      
 decreasing as many more are taking    
 early retirement.
