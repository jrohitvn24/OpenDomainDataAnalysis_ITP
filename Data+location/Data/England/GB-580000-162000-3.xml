		<title>03EVENTS ON PARKWOOD</title>
		<content>      There  are  many events that take
 place on Parkwood Green. Fairs are the
 most popular and they are usually held
 in the school holidays or at weekends.
 Usually there are about 100-200 people
 who attend each event and an enjoyable
 time is  had  by  all. On the 6th. May
 1985 there  was a  free fair. The food
 was at  quite  reasonable prices - hot
 dogs - 25p, beefburgers - 30p  and the
 drinks were reasonable too. There were
 inflatable  castles  for  the  younger
 children to  play  on. Boot fairs  are
 regular   events   also.   These   are
 organised  by  the  schools'  Parents'
 Association  to  raise extra funds for
 the  school  children.  There are many
 activities  there and lots  of  stalls
 selling odd bits and pieces.
