		<content> Harbottle during the Middle Ages, when
 England and Scotland were separate    
 kingdoms, was with Norham a major     
 stronghold in Northumberland - more   
 important even than Newcastle. After  
 the Union,the castle was used as a    
 "quarry" for the new Harbottle Castle.
   The area is mainly involved in      
 farming, the chief  interest being in 
 sheep,with some cattle and the        
 production of crops such as barley and
 turnips to support them.The south-west
 of the area is moorland and forestry. 
   The working population which was    
 intensive in agriculture has now      
 greatly reduced because of modern     
 methods and mechanisation.            
  Because of better transport          
 facilities,people can now travel away 
 for their work and leissure.
