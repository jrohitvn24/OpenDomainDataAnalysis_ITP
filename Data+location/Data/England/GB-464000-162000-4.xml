		<content> The Fire Brigade, renamed Royal       
 Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service     
 (1985) is stationed in West End Rd by 
 Dad's Shop (since 1974) and consists  
 of 10 retained firemen, including a   
 baronet. The old station in The Street
 is now used as a G.P.O. Sorting       
 Office. Firemen wear yellow light     
 weight helmets, fire proof winter     
 tunics (Â£80), yellow waterproof       
 leggings and steel protected safety   
 boots. 6 men (maximum) go out each    
 time. It takes 4 years to train a     
 fireman. There are about 25 calls in a
 quiet month. Peak times are in October
 (chimney fires) and in dry summers. In
 last years drought firemen regularly  
 watered young trees on the fairground.
 This year the Fire Brigade is sharing 
 organisation of the Mortimer Horse    
 Show(for National Benevolent Fund)    
 with Mortimer Cricket Club.           </content>
