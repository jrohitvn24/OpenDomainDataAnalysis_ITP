 ABBOTSHAM WESTWARD HO LONDONDERRY AND 
 MORETON PARK ESTATES                  
                                       
 situation at N.E.tip of a bay which is
 part of a more extensive sea area     
 known as Bideford  or  Barnstaple Bay.
 There are three main areas of         
 habitation  (1) Abbotsham   (2)  A    
 part of Westward Ho  (3) New housing  
 estates at Londonderry  Farm and      
 Moreton Park.                         
 Otherwise the area is rural and       
 maritime. The climate is equable and  
 the scenery varied and beautiful.     
 The  principal  occupations are       
 agriculture and tourism. As would     
 be expected large numbers of people   
 retire in the area. Abbotsham         
 and Westward Ho serve as dormitory    
 villages for people who  work in      
 Bideford and Barnstaple.              </content>
