 Skerries has{dances}in winter and a   
 person who is going to get married has
 a{reception}in the hall. Skerries     
 people have other people from Shetland
 to come and entertain them with       
 concerts. The young people have{discos
 occasionally at weekends.             
 At the beginning of the year we have a
 buffet supper to present the sports   
 trophies. In winter people play each  
 other at{badminton, pool}and{snooker. 
 They also play{tabletennis}and they   
 have a{bowling}tournament in January  
 and the older people play bowls.      
 There is very little{outdoor sports   
 but we hope to get a multicourt.
