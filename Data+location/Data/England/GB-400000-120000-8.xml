		<title>08DAIRY FARMING: BOWERCHALKE</title>
		<content> One dairy herd of 145 cows and 25     
 'followers' is run on the 94 acres of 
 the stipulated area. This is          
 fertilised by farm effluent and       
 chemicals.                            
 BREEDS - Friesian crossed with        
 Canadian/Dutch Holstein. Artificial   
 Insemination is used except for the   
 heifers which run with a bull.        
 In winter, cows are kept in modern    
 housing in deep litter; from November 
 cows remain outside in the daytime,   
 only feeding on kale. They then have  
 about 2 months under cover until early
 March, when they spend the days       
 outside on rye and silage. By April,  
 grass is suitable for 24hourly        
 grazing. Feed is supplemented.        
 "CONTRACT MILKING": One dairyman is   
 employed. Milk is sold to the Milk    
 Marketing Board direct. They carry    
 out daily tests.Milk is top grade.    </content>
