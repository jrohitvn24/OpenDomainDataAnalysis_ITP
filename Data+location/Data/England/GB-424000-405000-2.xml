		<title>02DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> Our area was mostly farmland. We      
 spotted wheat, barley and potatoes    
 being grown.Many of the fields were   
 grass, for animal fodder.Most of the  
 grain growing land was owned by the   
 Cannon Hall estate. The numerous      
 other farms were on a much smaller    
 scale. They ranged from about 2O acres
 to 4O acres. Some farmers rented more 
 fields from Cannon Hall estate when   
 they were needed. Nearly all were     
 mixed farms with a number of dairy    
 cows, chickens and goats.             
 There were quite a few woodland areas 
 which were mainly deciduous and       
 unmanaged. There were a number of     
 small streams running through the area
 and half a dozen springs also in      
 evidence. Many farms farms had wells  
 from these, though few were in use.   
 Two disused mills and millponds were  
 found at Gunthwaite and Cawthorne.    </content>
