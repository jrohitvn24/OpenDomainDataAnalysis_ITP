		<title>10Bonfire Night in Chobham</title>
		<content>{Bonfire Night}is celebrated on the 5th
 November on Chobham Green in Burrow   
 Hill. 1000 people parade through      
 Chobham village of which 300 carry    
 torches. The{torches}are thick pieces 
 of firewood with material soaked in   
 paraffin which is set alight at the   
 appropriate moment. Approximately     
 10,000 people attend bonfire night.   
 The organisers are Mr James and Mr    
 Robottom.{Fireworks}come in all shapes
 and sizes from small{sparklers}which  
 you hold in your hand to{rockets}which
 break up in the air. There is a very  
 large{bonfire}which takes several     
 days to build. The displays of        
 fireworks are colourful, noisy and    
 dazzling to watch. Some people own    
 portable food bars and they bring them
 along to the occasion. Other people   
 sell luminous necklaces.
