		<title>13A Game we Play at School</title>
		<content>    Many games are played at school,   
 but this is one of our favourites,    
 called{'Nuts and Bolts':} one person  
 stands in the  middle and is 'it' and 
 chooses someone to run.  The runner   
 may then call one of four things:     
{'Nuts'}and he runs on his own;        
{'Screws'}and he chooses someone to run
 with him;{'Nails'}and he chooses two  
 people to run with him; and{'Bolts'}  
 and everyone goes.  If he is caught he
 helps the person who is it catch      
 everyone else.  If he gets across then
 everyone else tries to get across.    
  The last person caught is it.  The   
 people who are it must stand ten yards
 from the home area at each end of     
 the ground, which is where the        
 runners have to try and run to.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
