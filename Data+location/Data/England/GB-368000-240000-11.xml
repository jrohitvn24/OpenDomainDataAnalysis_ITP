		<title>11WITHERS FRUIT FARM CONT.</title>
		<content> This is a well patronized{fruit farm  
 and the{prices for 1985 for fruits}are
 as follows:- Raspberries, strawberries
 logan, tay, blackberries 36 pence per 
 pound, gooseberries 20p, blackcurrants
 25p, red currants 30p, apples and     
 pears (many different varieties) and  
 plums 15 - 20p per pound.             
 However{95% of the fruit}is sent to   
 the local{Wye Fruit Co-op in Ledbury, 
 which is a subsiduary of{Home Grown   
{Fruits of Canterbury.}From here soft  
{fruits are marketed}straight to the   
 shops and apples and pears are put in 
 a{special cold store.                 
 Fruit is not grown for jam etc. as the
 price barely covers the picking costs.
{Three full-time men are employed}and  
{40 pickers}during the season, usually 
 housewives and school leavers, who    
 are slower, but more careful with the 
 soft fruit than the travelling people.</content>
