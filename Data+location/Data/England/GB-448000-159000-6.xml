    The family are very keen on nature 
 conservation and the estate contains  
 200 acres of woodland which are the   
 home of many forms of wildlife        
 including deer.The deer are mostly    
 small roe deer with a few barking     
 deer.They are not kept as game,but to 
 add to the natural beauty of the      
 environment.                          
    The copses are mainly oak and ash  
 but future plantings will include     
 beech and wild cherry to add more     
 colour.
