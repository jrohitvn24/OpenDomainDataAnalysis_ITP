		<content> Childrens' games become more grown up 
 as children grow older. A child of    
 five or six might play ring-a-roses,  
 dolls and ted, shops, hairdressers,   
 dolls houses, schools, and many other 
 games. Older children might call these
 games babyish. Children of between ten
 and twelve wouldn't really play as    
 much as younger children, but they    
 might play the following: bat and     
 ball, football, talk, races, Queeny,  
 skipping, tag, catch, sunbathing,     
 hoops, hopscotch and quite a few      
 others. Thirteens to adults usually   
 play board games, like chess, Monopoly
 and more. Old people don't usually    
 play much, they just watch T.V. or    
 read. My favourite games are board    
 games, because they are nice and      
 quiet. Good for rainy days!
