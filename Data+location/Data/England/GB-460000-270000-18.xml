In Class 3 at West Haddon School 12    
children out of 18 have a home         
computer.                              
                                       
  The most common computer is the      
Spectrum 48k.There is also one         
Commodore 64,one B.B.C., one Acorn     
Electron, one Osborne, and one         
Philips. The favourite game for the    
Spectrum is "Jet Set Willy" which is   
about a man called Mr. Willy who has   
just bought a mansion and he hasn't    
explored it properly yet. He has just  
had a party and he has to clear        
everything up before he can go to bed. 
The computers are kept mostly in the   
bedrooms but some are kept in living   
rooms or a study, and one is kept      
under the T.V. The average time the    
computers are used is 9 hours a week.
