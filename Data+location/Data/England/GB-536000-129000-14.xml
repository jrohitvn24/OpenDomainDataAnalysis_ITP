		<title>14Highbrook - Buildings</title>
		<content> Several buildings date from the late  
 16th and early 17th century. It was an
 area of smallholdings each with a     
 farmhouse whose occupants often needed
 other sources of income to subsist.   
 When the land passed from monastic    
 hands at the dissolution the new      
 owners often improved their homes.    
 Many timber-framed buildings remain.  
 These have mostly been carefully      
 restored and extended in succeeding   
 centuries. Local cladding materials   
 are mostly brick and clay tiles but   
 there is some use of local sandstone  
 and Horsham slates for roofing. There 
 are three Oast houses, two in         
 Highbrook of which one remains        
 unconverted.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
