		<content>{A Day in the Life of Briony Dixon     
                                       
      On Saturday,the 20th. of July    
 1985 this was one day in my life.     
      I got up and got dressed into my 
 blue and green dress. Then I had my   
 hair washed my Mum. After that I went 
 down stairs to have my breakfast. My  
 Dad has his breakfast before us       
 because he goes to work. After        
 breakfast I did some of my Maths. My  
 Mum is 32,my Dad is 36. My Dad works  
 at Gillets,an engineering firm,down   
 the Creek. I am 8 years old and my    
 sister,Esther,is 6. My best school    
 activity is swimming in which I enjoy 
 doing a handstand with legs straight  
 over. My name is Briony Dixon.
