		<title>10Doodle Bug on Dedworth.</title>
		<content> On a brilliantly, sunny, midsummer's  
 day in{1943}my father took me for a   
 bicycle ride to see some friends. I   
 was promised a ride on the swings as I
 cuddled up behind my Dad on the{comfy 
{seat on the back of his bicycle.}We   
 passed the milkman with his horse and 
 float and a few cyclists but no cars. 
 On our journey we looked out across   
 fields and the first of the many farms
 there were at Dedworth. The smell of  
 new mown hay, cows, horses and the    
 heady perfume of roses filled the air.
 Dad pedalled along with an occasional 
 question as to whether I was          
 comfortable and then suddenly the     
{idyllic peace was shattered}with an   
 awful{boomp-boomp-boomp}noise that    
 came from overhead, yet seemed to echo
 from inside you. I glanced upwards and
 saw a long cigar-shaped black object  
 with a fin at the back of it.         </content>
