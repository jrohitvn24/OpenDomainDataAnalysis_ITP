		<title>16WILMINGTON VILLAGE - GENERAL</title>
		<content>  The village of Wilmington lies to the
south of Dartford and although often   
included in information on Dartford    
retains its identity and its rural     
nature. The village is surrounded on 3 
sides by farmland, the urbanised area  
of Dartford forming the fourth. The    
Parish of Wilmington is one of the     
largest in the country. The history    
of Wilmington dates back to pre-Roman  
times, Neolithic flint tools have been 
found in the area. The area was also   
famous for its cherry orchards.        
  The Wilmington Society concerns      
itself with the preservation of the    
village atmosphere. Its aim is to      
retain the land between Dartford and   
Swanley as an area keeping its         
agricultural viability and the green   
appearance of areas around settlements.
It is for each of us to oppose         
urbanisation here.                     </content>
