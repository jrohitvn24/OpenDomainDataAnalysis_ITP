		<content> My name is Nick Warhurst and I come   
 from Hillbourne Middle School.I am in 
 the fourth year and we are taking part
 in the Domesday project.On the trips  
 we were broken into eight groups.Two  
 groups went on a trip at a time and   
 each group had two trips.We went in   
 the mini-bus.Most of the groups saw a 
 lot of heathland and residential      
 areas.Our group did a survey on Corfe 
 Mullen and from the reservoir we could
 look over Poole Harbour,our area,and  
 most of Poole.After we had been on two
 trips we had to make a map with       
 different coloured sticky paper using 
 a key.
