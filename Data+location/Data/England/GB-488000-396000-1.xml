		<title>01SCOTTON &amp; NORTHORPE SUMMARY</title>
		<content> This is a rural area, lying roughly   
 midway between the market town of     
 Gainsborough (10km SW of Northorpe)   
 and the steel town of Scunthorpe (12km
 N of Scotton). Northorpe (135         
 inhabitants) and Scotton (450) are far
 from being domitory villages. The land
 is devoted almost entirely to farming,
 but very few people living here are   
 involved in agriculture;  many work   
 outside the area. Travel is mainly    
 by private car; little public         
 transport remains, but Scotton is on a
 bus route.   The railway running SW-NE
 across the eastern half of the area is
 now reduced to single track and       
 carries goods only. {Scotton, Land-   
{scape and Buildings, Population,      
{and Local History (except place names)
{are entered under Block 04880399, as  
{most of Scotton lies in that area.
