		<content>    Each resident pays Â£135 a week for 
 a place. Practically all are sponsored
 by local authorities or by the DHSS.  
    The centre has an income of Â£2.6   
 million a year, all of which is       
 ploughed back in.                     
    The residents are paid for any work
 they do. The Government disregards the
 first Â£4 a week they earn but beyond  
 that they start to lose benefit.      
    The school staff consists of 13    
 well qualified full time teachers and 
 includes specialists in Art, Home     
 Economics, Drama and Music. On the    
 residential side there is a total of  
 23 full time child_care staff.        
    The school takes children of both  
 primary and secondary age. There are  
 links with the local college of       
 further education and older children  
 are involved in work experience       
 programmes.                           </content>
