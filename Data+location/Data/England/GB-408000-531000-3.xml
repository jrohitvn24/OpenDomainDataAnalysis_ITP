		<title>03INDUSTRY-HAMSTERLEY FOREST</title>
		<content>   Hamsterley Forest was established as
 an early development of the Commission
 aiming in 1922 to build up Great      
 Britain's strategic reserve of timber,
 Hamsterley particularly providing     
 pit-props for the Durham Coal field.  
   In the plantations there is a wide  
 range of commercial species,          
 concentrating on softwood timber;     
 Norway and Sitka Spruce, Pine, Douglas
 Fir, Larch and Western Hemlock. Some  
 areas are planted with two species;   
 oak/larch.  The major planting,       
 commenced in l927, is now being       
 harvested as mature trees.  The forest
 provides employment for 13 men of whom
 5 live in the forest and each activity
 is supervised by a head of department.
 In addition there are usually about 8 
 men employed by contractors. The      
 production is now predominantly       
 used for saw logs and pulping.        </content>
