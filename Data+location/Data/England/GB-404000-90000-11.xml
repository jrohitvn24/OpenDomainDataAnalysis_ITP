		<title>11A Day in the Life of Zoey</title>
		<content> On Thursdays I get up and go down the 
 stairs and I have some breakfast, then
 I get washed and dressed, brush my    
 teeth and brush my hair.If there is   
 time I play for a bit,then at half    
 past 8 I take my lunch box and a bag  
 for my swimming and go to school.     
 When I get there we have the register 
 then we do a bit of work before we go 
 swimming.  I can do front crawl and   
 backstroke and breaststroke.  When we 
 get back it is playtime.  After play, 
 we do a bit of work then we go to     
 dinner-play and afterwards, we have   
 our dinner and then we go out to play 
 again. After play, we have silent     
 reading, then we do a bit of work     
 until playtime. We do a bit more work 
 then until it is hometime.            
 When I go home sometimes I just play  
 then I go and have my tea.  At half   
 past 8, I go to bed.                  </content>
