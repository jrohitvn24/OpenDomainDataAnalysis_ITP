 If the development occurred,          
 Warfield's individuality and          
 countryside would be spoilt. The major
 increase in the volume of traffic     
 would cause problems like pollution.  
 A recent survey showed that 84% of the
 population chose to spend their       
 leisure time in the countryside.      
 Villages like Warfield and Binfield   
 are a target for developers, rural    
 land being cheaper than central city  
 sites. If this particular area becomes
 over developed, the villages will     
 merge into Bracknell, losing their    
 friendly atmosphere and so increasing 
 social problems. By continually       
 building in South East England,       
 pressure is put on the depressed      
 Northern areas, so detracting industry
 from the regions most in need of it.
