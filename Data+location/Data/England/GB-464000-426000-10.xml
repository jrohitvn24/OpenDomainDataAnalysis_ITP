 Camblesforth County Primary School    
 Classes One and Two were shown round  
 Drax Power Station by some of the men 
 that work there. We were shown around 
 the construction site and the station 
 itself. The Power Station uses coal   
 from the Selby Coal Field. The coal is
 brought by train to the coal plant. It
 drops from the waggons through the    
 track to a conveyor belt on which it  
 is taken into the station. There are  
 about three trains an hour. The coal  
 is powdered and fed into the boilers. 
 The powder is burnt to heat the water,
 and the steam this produces turns the 
 turbines which generate the           
 electricity.
