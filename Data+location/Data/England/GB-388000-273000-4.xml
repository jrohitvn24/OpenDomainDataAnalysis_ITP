		<content> The main street in Chaddesley Corbett 
 has not changed much in the last 300  
 years. The original line of houses is 
 still there with the houses standing  
 on plots of land that are drawn in    
 early maps. Over the years additional 
 houses have been built by the local   
 authority and by private builders. The
 old school and workhouse have been    
 converted into flats. Some houses are 
 owner occupied and some rented.       
 There is very good provision for old  
 people, in the alms houses and council
 bungalows, with a resident Warden on  
 call to look after them.              
 There are some families with school   
 aged children but many tenants and    
 home owners are middle aged and       
 elderly.                              
 Properties are highly priced as       
 Chaddesley Corbett is a prestigious   
 village.                              </content>
