		<title>13FARMING IN NEWTOWN AREA</title>
		<content> The area contains 498 hectares of farm
 land, farmed by 14 farmers with areas 
 between 13 -88 hectares. 10 are owner 
 occupiers of 240 h.: 4 farmers have   
 tenanted all their land and 2 supple- 
 ment their own land by tenanting. The 
 largest landlords are Winchester      
 College and Southwick Estate. In 1985 
 61.5h.were cereal crops,4.5h. potatoes
 and 3h. vegetables. The remaining 429h
 were grass for haymaking, grazing or  
 making sileage. One farmer sells the  
 turf for lawn making. The heavy clay  
 soil is reflected by the large area of
 grass supporting 533 beef cattle,210  
 milking cows and 101 young stock for  
 replacement. They have to be taken off
 most fields in the winter to prevent  
 damage to the grass crop by poaching. 
 There are two pig farms ,two horse    
 breeding units and a few sheep, goats 
 and poultry are kept.                 </content>
