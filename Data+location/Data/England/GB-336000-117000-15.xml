 At Hallowe'en time every year there is
 a Punkie Night.We have competitions   
 such as Fancy Dress &amp; Best Decorated  
 Pumpkin.We have many stalls &amp;         
 refreshments are sold.In November the 
 Junior class took part in the B.B.C.  
 Time &amp; Tune concert in the Colston    
 Hall in Bristol.I played my violin &amp;  
 some other children played their      
 recorders.We had a Christmas Bazaar in
 December selling clothes,toys &amp; books.
 We all took part in a Christmas       
 concert for our parents.At our        
 Christmas party we joined with Shepton
 Beauchamp school to be entertained by 
 a magician.After that we had our tea &amp;
 everyone was given a card &amp; a present 
 from under the Christmas tree.
