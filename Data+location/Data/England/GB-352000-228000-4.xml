		<title>04HOARWITHY CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Italian style church at Hoarwithy 
 provides an unusual feature in this   
 typical Herefordshire scene.The       
 original Chapel of Ease was erected in
 the 1840s,but when the Rev.william    
 Poole became vicar he decided to      
 enhence the plain building.By 1888 the
 unique church with its cloisters and  
 camponile tower,designed by a London  
 archetect,has been built around the   
 existing chapel.The ornate interior is
 decorated with mosaics,marble         
 columns,wood carvings and stained     
 glass windows.The church built of red 
 sandstone has not weathered well,and  
 the mosaics are in need of            
 repair.Restoration of ST. Catherine's 
 commenced in 1971 with further work   
 completed in 1980.Services are held   
 monthly,attanded by a small but       
 enthusiastic congregation.
