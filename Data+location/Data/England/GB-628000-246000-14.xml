		<title>14SEWAGE WORKS AT SUTTON</title>
		<content>{It is rather a surprise to find in    
{such a rural area of farmland and     
{woodland, two large sewage works.}    
                                       
  It is also surprising in an area of  
  such beautiful hedgerows, with       
  rabbits playing almost oblivious to  
  one's presence, to be suddenly       
  deafened by the noise of a pack of   
  fighter aircraft passing overhead.   
                                       
 But therein lies the reason, a        
 community of many thousands of        
 american personnel at R.A.F Woodbridge
 live and work there, completely       
 self-contained, out-of-view among the 
 trees with their own schools, shops   
 and , of course,                      
                                       
     {even their own sewage works!     
                                       
                                       </content>
