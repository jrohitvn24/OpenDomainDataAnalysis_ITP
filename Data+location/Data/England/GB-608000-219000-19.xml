		<title>19ECOLOGY OF THE REGION</title>
		<content> THE AREA WAS ONCE HEAVILY WOODED  AND 
 A WIDE VARIETY OG TREES ARE STILL TO  
 BE FOUND, BOTH INDIGENOUS AND         
 INTRODUCED. MUCH OF THE AREA          
 IS LOW-LYING, WITH AREAS OF WET, PEATY
 LAND AND SALT MARSHES BOARDERING THE  
 EAST OF THE REGION. THERE IS A        
 PROFUSION OF WILD FLOWERS TO BE FOUND 
 IN ENVIRONMENTS RANGING FROM HEATHLAND
 TO WOODLAND. ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE     
 HEDGES HAVE BEEN REMOVED TO CREATE    
 LARGER FIELDS, THERE ARE STILL MANY   
 ROADSIDE VERGES WHICH OFFER A SUPER   
 HABITAT FOR WILD FLOWERS AND          
 CREATURES.  RABBITS, HARES, FOXES,    
 DEER, AND ALL COMMON WILD BIRDS ARE TO
 BE FOUND IN THE REGION. KESTRELS ARE  
 PARTICULARLY COMMON. THE CLIMATE OF   
 THE REGION IS GREATLY INFLUENCED BY   
 ITS PROXIMITY TO THE EAST COAST AND   
 COLD WINDS ARE A PARTICULAR FEATURE.
