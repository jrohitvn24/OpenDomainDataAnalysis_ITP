		<title>10SCORES - LOWESTOFT</title>
		<content>One of the characteristics of LOWESTOFT
is the many flights of steps or roads  
leading down from the main roads       
especially the High Street, Yarmouth   
Road, and the shopping area leading    
down to the commercial area of the     
Denes. These roads are called 'SCORES' 
as in the early days they were just    
dirt tracks and looked like the        
scratches made on the skin of a        
side of pork.                          
The land at the foot of the scores was 
protected from sea erosion by the      
building of a concrete breakwater and a
sea wall.                              
The scores were always connected with  
the fishing industry - eg.Rope Walk.   
Part of the area is still used for the 
drying of fishing nets today.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
