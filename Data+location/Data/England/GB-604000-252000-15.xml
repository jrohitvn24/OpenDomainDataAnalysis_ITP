The Rector of Barking is also Rector of
Battisford and Ringshall, and is       
assisted by two lay readers. The       
services for the three churches are on 
a monthly rota with one service in each
church each week except for the fifth  
Sunday when there is a combined        
service.                               
Battisford has a similar attendance    
to Barking but Ringshall is smaller.   
The joint Sunday school is held each   
Saturday from 9.30a.m. to 11.00 a.m.   
for 3 - 10 year olds, and is called    
"Saturday Special".                    
The Free Church at Barking is also well
attended, both at their Sunday services
and their Sunday School and Youth Club.
They also provide entertainment during 
the school holidays.
