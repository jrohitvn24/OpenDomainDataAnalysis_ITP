		<title>05Pubs in Braunton.</title>
		<content> Most of the public houses in Braunton 
 date from the{18th or 19th century.   
 Here is a list of most of them:The    
 London Inn,The Agricultural Inn,The   
 Mariners Arms,White Lion,The George,  
 The New Inn,The Black Horse and The   
 Williams Arms.{The Mariners}is        
 so called because all the master      
 mariners used to drink there.{The     
{London Inn}is named because it is     
 situated on the old main road to      
 London.{The New Inn}is probably the   
 oldest pub.Any pub called the New Inn 
 probably goes back to the days of     
 Queen Elizabeth the 1st.Inns were then
 introduced as places where you could  
 drink,eat and stay the night.This was 
 a new thing and thus they were called 
 New Inns.{The Agricutural}was named   
 after the farming business, and the   
 farmers who probably used it on market
 days.                                 </content>
