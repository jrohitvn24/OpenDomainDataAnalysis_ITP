		<title>12MARWOOD N. THE SCHOOL TODAY</title>
		<content>    Our school,MARWOOD C.P. SCHOOL,was 
 built about 110 years ago.One of the  
 unusual things about it is  we        
 actually ring a hand bell for the     
 start of school and the end of        
 playtime.There are about 75 children  
 in 3 classes.Mr.Brooks is the         
 headmaster.                           
    In our class there are 27,8_11year 
 olds and the infants are in the same  
 school.The windows are high which is  
 typical of Victorian Times partly so  
 that children wouldn't be distracted  
 by things going on outside the        
 classroom.                            
    Our school has not got a uniform   
 but there are T-shirts and sweat      
 shirts with the school emblem on them.
    Our classrooms have high ceilings  
 and they get very cold in winter.The  
 toilets also can freeze and sometimes 
 the school closes in snowy weather.   </content>
