		<content>   The Infant and Junior Schools are   
 on separate sites, and both have      
 experienced falling roles.  There is a
 proposal to close the Infants building
 and amalgamate the 2 schools at the   
 Junior School site.                   
   The Infants School was purpose-built
 and opened in 1969. It is open-plan   
 andd spacious inside. There is an     
 outdoor stage, concrete play          
 equipment,and different environments  
 for wildlife.                         
   When the school opened, there were  
 225 pupils. Now there are 95.         
  Construction of new classrooms at the
 Junior School site has already begun. 
 The proposal to close a 16-year old   
 school has, of course, caused great   
 controversy in the village. Despite a 
 recent political change on the County 
 Council, it looks likely to go ahead.
