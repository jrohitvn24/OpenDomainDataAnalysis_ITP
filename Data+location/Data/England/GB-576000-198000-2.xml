		<content> "My Mum goes to work at 9.00 to 5.30. 
 We go shopping every week to a        
 supermarket. When I grow up I am      
 hoping I can be a pilot of British    
 Airways. My house is in a builders'   
 yard. In the school holidays I go with
 my Dad to help. My Dad is a builder. I
 like to play in the sheds in the yard.
 This year we are going to Yorkshire   
 for a holiday. Our school is a Church 
 of England school with 44 pupils and  
 two classes. We have an outdoor       
 swimming pool that is heated by solar 
 panels. We start school at 9 and      
 finish at 3.05. My Mum is kind because
 she buys me things. At school my      
 teacher says I am a good worker. My   
 hobby is collecting badges and        
 rubbers. My Dad works as a gardener.  
 He starts at 8.30 and finishes at 5.  
 My Mum is a housewife. She does the   
 washing, cooking and cleaning.        </content>
