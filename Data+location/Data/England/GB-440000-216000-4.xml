		<title>04PHEASANT FARM</title>
		<content>There is a pheasant farm in Blenheim   
park. The gamekeeper showed us elastic 
bands attached to the wings of the     
pheasants,to stop them flying up.They  
peck each others feathers to get the   
protien from the tips. The pheasants   
are moved to a fresh piece of grass    
every two days to stop them getting    
dirty. The pheasants lay many eggs     
which are taken away, cleaned, and     
checked to see if they have any        
moisture which determines if it is     
worth trying to hatch them. They are   
put in a paddle incubater then into    
another incubater which tilts them     
every hour and then they are put in a  
still air incubater for the last four  
days of the twenty four days.          
There is a pheasant farm on the estate 
for game hunting and for income.
