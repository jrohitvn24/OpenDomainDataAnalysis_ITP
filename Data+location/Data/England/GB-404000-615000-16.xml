		<content> Mrs Dryden is our school caretaker.   
 She has lived in this area all her    
 life and when she was a girl she lived
 at Crawley farm. She came to school   
 with her husband to talk to us.       
 She told us that when she was young   
 they had no electricity. They used    
 paraffin lamps or candles. When they  
 were going to bed, they took their    
 candle upstairs, got comfortable, then
 blew out the candle.                  
 In those days the Antique Shop next to
 our school was a church. People used  
 to ride to church on horseback. The   
 stone steps for mounting the horses   
 are still there outside the building. 
 The church stables are now used as    
 private garages. Mrs Dryden was late  
 for her wedding because she had to    
 wait for the train to pass by on its  
 way to Coldstream. Now there is no    
 railway and the track is disused.     </content>
