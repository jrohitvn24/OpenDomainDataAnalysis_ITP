		<title>15CANAL, THATCHAM.</title>
		<content> The Kennet and Avon Canal sometimes   
 joins the River Kennet but more often 
 than not makes its own way from West  
 to East on the south of Thatcham. The 
 canal was originally opened in 1810   
 extending from Reading to Bristol. In 
 1841 the Great Western Railway was    
 opened and it was not long before     
 traffic on the canal started to       
 decline.                              
 The canal is now being restored and   
 only 3 stretches require attention    
 before it can be opened to traffic    
 entirely from the Bristol Channel     
 right through to the River Thames at  
 Reading. One of these stretches is in 
 the Thatcham area. It comprises the   
 length between Monkey Marsh Lock and  
 Midgham Lock.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
