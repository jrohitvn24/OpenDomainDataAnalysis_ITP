		<content>    This area includes much of the     
 Brighouse town centre, the industrial 
 area, a number of housing developments
 (both local authority and privately   
 owned) and large tracts of open land. 
 It touches Elland on its westernmost  
 side, the outskirts of Huddersfield on
 the South and Clifton on the North    
 East side of the town. The population 
 of Brighouse is about 35000.          
    Local industry includes light and  
 medium engineering, brickmaking and   
 flour  milling. Industrial control    
 valves, made in Brighouse, are sent   
 all over the world. Textiles,formerly 
 its mainstay, are now in a state of   
 rapid decline. The twin silos of      
 Sugden's flour mill dominate the local
 skyline, as they have for more than a 
 century. Other landmarks, former      
 textile mills, have been destroyed by 
 fires during recent years.            </content>
