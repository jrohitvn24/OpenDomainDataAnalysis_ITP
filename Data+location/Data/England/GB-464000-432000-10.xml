		<title>10South Duffield - recreation</title>
		<content>      Children in South Duffield are   
 not very pleased with the villagers   
 because they have been refused a      
{playing field.                        
{                                      
      There is nowhere to play in South
 Duffield except the road, and a       
 meeting was held in June 1985 to      
 discuss having a playing field. But   
 villagers voted not to have one,      
 because they all thought it would be  
 near their homes.                     
                                       
     If a site could have been found   
 out of the village they would have    
 voted for it. But the only field      
 available is near the centre of the   
 village, and most people voted against
 it because they did not want the noise
 and the nuisance, and making a        
 playing field would cost too much.
