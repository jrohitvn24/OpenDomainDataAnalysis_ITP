		<content> The Snaith/Cowick area has strong ties
 with the chemical company Croda. The  
 company whose early manufacture of    
 lanoline was at Rawcliffe Bridge,     
 moved its headquarters into Snaith in 
 1946. The building situated opposite  
 St Lawrence Church was in fact the    
 former Vicarage. The company          
 experienced major growth in the post  
 war period and in 1955 found itself   
 short of accommodation. It came to the
 attention of the Board of Directors   
 that the owner of the nearby Georgian 
 Mansion, Cowick Hall, intended to     
 demolish it but was being prevented   
 from doing so by the Historic         
 Buildings Council. The Hall, which had
 been a country seat of Viscount Downe,
 was used mainly for storage. The      
 Directors were successful in          
 negotiating a lease and consequently  
 took possession of the Hall and park. </content>
