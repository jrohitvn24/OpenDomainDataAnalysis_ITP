		<title>01THE BRIDGWATER AREA</title>
		<content> The area covered by this block        
 depicts the industrial, commercial and
 rural nature of Bridgwater. It is a   
 busy market town with one very large  
 factory, which is the major employer  
 for the area. At the time of this     
 survey several major changes are      
 taking place .A new{shopping precinct 
 is in the process of construction and 
{new roads}are being built to ease the}
 traffic congestion in the town centre.
 Several of the town's established     
 industries have closed during recent  
 years and smaller industries,         
 employing up to a dozen people, are   
 opening up on the two industrial      
 estates on the outskirts.             
 The annual{Carnival}is watched by     
 people who travel from all parts parts
 of the country and the skill and      
 artistry of the various "gangs" is    
 greatly admired by all.               </content>
