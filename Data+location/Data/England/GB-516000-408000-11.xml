		<title>11A SCHOOL DAY IN KEELBY</title>
		<content> On a school day I go downstairs to    
 have my cup of tea and my breakfast   
 (Special K or Coco pops.)My sister    
 goes to school then.She has to walk to
 the bus stop with her friend,then she 
 gets on the school bus.She has to go  
 by bus as her school isnot in Keelby  
 but in Healing.I shall go there       
 when I am 11.After she's gone to      
 school and I've finished my breakfast 
 I clean my teeth.Then I get my school 
 basket ready and go to school.To get  
 to my school I have to walk to the top
 of our road,cross over,walk down      
 Wivell Drive and the school is across 
 the playing field.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
