		<content>     When I got home on Friday, I went 
 upstairs and listened to some pop     
 music. Then I went out to the shed to 
 feed my four dogs: Manix the Jack     
 Russell, Tim the Bulldog, Jumbo the   
 Rottweiler and Buster the Alsatian. I 
 took Manix for a walk because he is   
 the smallest. Then I had My tea:_ egg,
 spaghetti and chips.                  
     Afterwards I called for Julie and 
 went for a bike ride to the canal.    
 When we got back to Julie's house, her
 mum said I could sleep the night. So  
 we dashed down to my house to ask my  
 mum. She said yes and gave us a bottle
 of pop, a bag of crisps, a chocolate  
 bar and 20p each.                     
     The next morning we got up and    
 watched a video. We didn't get dressed
 until one o'clock. I had dinner with  
 Julie and then went home.
