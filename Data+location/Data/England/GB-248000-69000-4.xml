		<content> The farmers in our area do not use the
 most modern machines,because the farms
 are small and the equipment is        
 expensive.Most farm work is done by   
 tractors.Special attachments drop     
{fertiliser}onto the soil near the     
 seeds.A mechanical lime spreader has  
 spinning discs which spread lime over 
 the soil to make it fertile.{Weeds}are
 a nuisance to the farmer.They grow    
 quickly and stop his crop from        
 growing.To get rid of them he uses a  
 sprayer filled with{weedkilling       
 liquid.The sprayer is usually a       
 plastic tank attached to a long pipe  
 with holes in.Another useful          
 weedkilling device is the flame gun.It
 is carried along and it burns out     
 weeds with a scorching flame.Modern   
 dairy farmers at{Sortridge Farm}use   
 mechanical devices to milk cows       
 hygenically and efficiently.          </content>
