		<title>12DISUSED QUARRY</title>
		<content> Carn Grey, a disused quarry, is 200m  
 above sea level. From the tor-like top
 there are magnificent panoramic views 
 of mid-Cornwall. It was used as a     
 general dumping ground until a few    
 years ago when it was transformed into
 a nature reserve by a group of school 
 children. It has a lake stocked with  
 trout and surrounded by willow trees. 
 The steep sides of the quarry are a   
 favourite haunt of snakes, such as the
 adder, and the surrounding moor is    
 well-populated with rabbits and other 
 small mammals.                        
                                       
 Despite its natural beauty, the area  
 is under new threats from motorcycle  
 scramblers who cut up the quarry floor
 with their tyre tracks. Fresh attempts
 are being made to restore the area to 
 the quiet splendour achieved by the   
 schoolchildren.                       </content>
