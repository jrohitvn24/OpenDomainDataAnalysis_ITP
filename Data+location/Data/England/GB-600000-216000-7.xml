		<title>07LANGENHOE HALL FARM</title>
		<content> We went to{Langenhoe Hall Farm.}The   
 farmer grows wheat on his farm . He   
 starts planting in September with a   
 seeder. He uses his TW25 to spray and 
 seed and plough.When the wheat is ripe
 in August the combine harvester cuts  
 it down.                              
                                       
 The farm covers 900 acres, most of the
 fields being large, upto 100 acres in 
 size. From a harvest of about 2500    
 tons, some of the wheat is sent to    
{Ipswich}and some to{London}and some is
 exported from the Hythe Quay in       
 Colchester.                           
                                       
 Some of the land near the river is    
 unsuitable for growing wheat and this 
 land is used for grazing cattle.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
