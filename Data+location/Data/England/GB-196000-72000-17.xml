		<title>17THE JOHN BETJEMAN CENTRE</title>
		<content> We should be proud to live in an area 
 that has been so influential in the   
 poetry of a{Poet Laureate}and that he 
 chose to be buried here in Cornwall   
 within a short distance of his        
 cottage.                              
{Wadebridge Concern for the Aged}has   
 been preparing for 10 years to build a
 centre for retired people whose       
 numbers grow  even larger.            
 Nobody likes to be thought to be old  
 because most people feel young at     
 heart though their bodies may show    
 evidence of the passage of many many  
 years.                                
 For this reason it was thought to be  
 an appropriate idea to name our centre
 after{John Betjeman}and call it{The   
{John Betjeman Centre}.The centre will 
 be comfortable and provide facilities 
 for friendship and learning.
