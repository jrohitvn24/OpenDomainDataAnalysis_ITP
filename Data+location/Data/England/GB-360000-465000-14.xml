		<content> On May 13th, 1985, we went to Higher  
 Broadwood Farm. We asked the farmer's 
 wife about the qualities necessary for
 her work and she said that they were  
 strength, not minding dirt or mud, and
 being a good cook. She has two Jacob's
 sheep, one of which has two lambs. She
 uses their brown, black and white     
 fleece to make wool which she weaves  
 into sweaters. When the farmer came   
 home for lunch, we asked him some     
 similar questions. He said that you   
 need to love animals and be prepared  
 to stay up with them when they are ill
 or pregnant.                          
 The farm consists of two houses, a    
 milking parlour, a barn, some cubicles
 for cows, a sheep dip, a slurry pit, a
 dairy, a maternity building and a hen 
 hut. In front of the garden is a field
 for growing the family's vegetables.
