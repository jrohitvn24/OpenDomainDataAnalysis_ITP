		<title>10CLOSURE OF THE BEET FACTORY</title>
		<content>      The closure of the Ely Sugar Beet
 Factory on the  19_2_81 dealt a blow  
 to our area's employment. It meant    
 the loss of 215 full time jobs and    
 130 casual workmen employed during the
 "Campaign" from September to February 
 when the beet is harvested and        
 processed. The National Union of      
 Agricultural and Allied Workers were  
 strongly opposed to its closing but   
 they knew their case was hopeless.The 
 British Sugar Corporation said that   
 the factory had to close because it   
 was too small,the machinery was       
 out-of-date and it produced           
 only raw sugar.They had already       
 modernised three larger factories     
 within a fifty mile radius.The        
 employees were given redundancy       
 payments or their company pensions.
