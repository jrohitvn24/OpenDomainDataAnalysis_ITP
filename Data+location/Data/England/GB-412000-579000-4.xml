		<title>04NORTHUMBRIAN DIALECT</title>
		<content> The Northumbrian dialect as spoken in 
 Whalton and the immediate area varies 
 little from that of a century ago.    
 However, with the demise of many of   
 the old village families and the      
 influx of more business and           
 professional people together with the 
 modern education system, the broad    
 accent is heard less nowadays. In fact
 a true Northumbrian dialect speaker is
 almost regarded as a 'turn' at a local
 concert. The dialect is produced by a 
 flattening or broadening of the       
 vowels. Real Whaltonians invariably   
 leave off the 'g' in such words as    
 goin', hangin' etc, and use 'aa'      
 instead of I. They are also prone to  
 use 'a', as in canna, when meaning    
 cannot. Whalton becomes Whaaltun as   
 opposed to Whaatun which was used in  
 the last century.
