		<title>06A Day In The Life Of ...</title>
		<content>  I go to school every day exept       
 Saturday and Sunday.Every monday I get
 up really late and have to wizz down  
 stairs remembering what day it is.    
 After breakfast I go back upstairs    
 and get dressed.My mum is 32 ,my dad  
 38 and my sister is 7.I go down to    
 school on my BMX.In our class there   
 are only 9 children.In the whole      
 school there are only 30 children and 
 2 teachers.My friend are Douglas who I
 sometimes fall out with an Spam,Alex, 
 Adam,Stephen,Ben and Matthew.At play- 
 time we play football.After play we do
 SMP maths.For dinner I bring a packed 
 lunch and then go out to play football
 again.In the afternoon we do English  
 and the teacher reads us a story.Then 
 I go home and watch TV till tea-time. 
 After tea I watch TV a bit more then  
 play with my Lego.I go to bed at 10 o'
 clock and read for about half an hour.</content>
