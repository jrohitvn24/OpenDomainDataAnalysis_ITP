		<content> I belong to the{church choir}and we   
 sing at a lot of services. There is   
 also a{junior choir}which I belonged  
 to when I was younger - their{practice
 is at church from 6.20 - 7.20 each    
 Friday night; the main choir practice 
 follows from 7.30 - 9.00. There is    
{evensong}and{morning service}every    
 Sunday except once a month when the   
 junior choir sing at the morning      
 service. There are also{weddings}that 
 we sometime sing at.{Christmas}is a   
 very busy time for us and so is{Easter
 time because there are a lot of       
 services for us to sing at. In the    
 summer holidays we don't have to go to
 the services. This year the choir went
 on an{outing}to Winchester.
