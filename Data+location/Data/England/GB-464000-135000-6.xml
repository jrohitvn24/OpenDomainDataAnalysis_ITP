		<content>        Medstead School is linked to a 
 many schools in the UK by means of the
 Times Network for schools.            
                                       
        In particular the school is    
 twinned with Audley Junior School,    
 Birmingham. This is a large inner city
 urban junior school, completely       
 different from Medstead.              
                                       
        Both schools belong to the IBM 
 PCs in schools project, and children  
 from the two schools communicate      
 regularly by means of the Times       
 Network.                              
                                       
        Children from Audley School    
 have visited Medstead and stayed      
 overnight with their penfriends, and a
 return visit is planned for 1986.
