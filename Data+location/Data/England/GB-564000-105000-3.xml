		<title>03Smuggling on the Marshes.</title>
		<content> The{Pevensey Levels}and the           
 surrounding areas have long been      
 famous for{smuggling.}We discovered   
 that the eighteenth century is often  
 thought of as the golden age of Sussex
{smuggling.}It would appear that nearly
 everyone was involved in one way or   
 another and it is not difficult to    
 imagine the smugglers bringing the    
 goods stealthily across the{marshes.  
 Our school is in{Hankham}and we know  
 of houses in the area where smugglers 
 were "welcome" in the olden days and  
 where there are disused smuggler      
 tunnels. The house opposite our school
 is called{The Dog House.}It received  
 its name because the original cottages
 were occupied by the customs men and  
 they were known as{Watchdogs.}Their   
 job was to hunt down smugglers on the 
{marshes.}The house is owned by Mr.Gow,
 Member of Parliament for{Eastbourne.  </content>
