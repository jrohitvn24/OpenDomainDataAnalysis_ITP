		<title>15TRAVEL TO SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    Most people live in Bishop's       
 Stortford, although there are many    
 living in the local villages. Most    
 people travel to school by bus or     
 coach. Several people travel by car, a
 couple from Essex travel by           
 train for part of their journey.      
    In my form of 34 children their    
 home settlements were:                
 *Bishops Stortford (17) *Thorley (3)  
 *Bury Green (2)  *Harlow (1)          
 *Hunsdon (1) *Elsenham (1) *Albury (1)
 *Berden (1) *Standon (1) *Henham (1)  
 *Much Hadham (1) *Furneux Pelham (1)  
 *Stansted Mountfitchett (1)           
 *Farnham (1) *Hadham Hall (1)         
    There is a good deal of choice in  
 Education with 2 Girl's, 1 Boy's, 2   
 Mixed and a Catholic School in the    
 local area. There are also private    
 schools.
