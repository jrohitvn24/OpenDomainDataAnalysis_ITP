		<content>    Most families in the valley own a  
{car.}Ulverston and Ambleside are the  
 nearest shopping centres which are    
 about 11 miles away. Some people like 
 to go to bigger towns like Lancaster, 
 Kendal and Barrow.                    
    There is an alternative to using a 
 car and that is the{postbus.}The      
 postbus is a red post office van which
 delivers the letters and it also      
 carries pasengers. It comes twice a   
 day.The post bus is licensed to carry 
 up to 11 pasengers. It will pick you  
 up or drop you off anywhere along its 
 route. On school days you can catch   
 the{large bus}which takes the         
 secondary school children to          
 Ulverston.                            
    Old people are often given lifts by
 friends who have cars. They also have 
 outings by bus paid for by Age Concern
 and the OAP committee.                </content>
