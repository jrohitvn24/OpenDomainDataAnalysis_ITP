 Both New and Old Costessey are mainly 
 dormitories for people who work in the
 Norwich area, although there are a few
 light industries along the south side 
 of the Dereham Road (A47).  There is  
 farmland between Old and New          
 Costessey, and beyond Old Costessey,  
 but this provides little employment   
 these days.                           
 The main industry in Costessey in the 
 last century was brickmaking, which   
 was quite a flourishing business;  of 
 course, farming provided more         
 employment then, too.  A sizeable     
 number of people in Costessey run     
 service industries from home          
 (decorating, building, skip hire,     
 etc.).
