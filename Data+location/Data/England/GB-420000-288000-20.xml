		<title>20Footpaths around Coleshill.</title>
		<content> There are still many footpaths from   
 Coleshill into the surrouding         
 countryside most are from the town to 
 the outlying large farms.They are     
 hundreds of years old and wereused by 
 farm workers to get to work.Nowadays  
 we use them for leisure.The tracks and
 footpaths are used by people for      
 walking or exercising their dogs.They 
 are well trodden,well marked by       
 signposts and not difficult to walk.In
 Shushtoke this was not always true.   
 Some farmers had planted crops over   
 the path and althougth it was well    
 signposted it was impossible to walk. 
 Other pastures had electric fences    
 around them.Some were clearly marked  
 but impossible because of mud,animals 
 and farm machinery.In Maxstoke paths  
 are used little difficult to walk.    
 However,this beautiful area can still 
 be enjoyed by walking.                </content>
