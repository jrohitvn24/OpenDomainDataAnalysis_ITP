		<title>02Mr Marchant the Pig Farmer.</title>
		<content>{Mr Marchant }has been a pig farmer for
 10 years. After studying at college   
 for two years he spent two years as a 
 pig man, about 7 years in pig farm    
 management and in 1984 bought his own 
 farm. He has 21 acres of land,17 acres
 of which he crops (Winter Wheat). He  
 has about{750 Pigs}altogether, about  
 110 being{Breeding sows}and{5 Boars.} 
 About{2,600 piglets }are born each    
 year. They are sold after about 10    
 weeks. The pig food comes from a mill 
 in Oxford. It is mostly Wheat and     
 Barley and Bean meal,Fish meal which  
 has plenty of protein, and Milk       
 extract for the young ones. The       
 hardest part of Mr. Marchant's job is 
 getting the {sows}to farrow at the    
 right time, he has not the room to    
 cope with too many piglets. He starts 
 work around 7:30am and finishes his   
 day about 7:30pm.                     </content>
