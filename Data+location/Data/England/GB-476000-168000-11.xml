		<title>11   HOUSING ON WOOSEHILL</title>
		<content>  Woosehill is an expanding housing    
 development built on agricultural land
 .Once the land was released for       
 housing,groups of developers bought   
 sites,capitalising on the many        
 advantages of the location and its    
 easy access to direct routes to London
 for commuters.                        
 There is a lot of variety in both size
 and style of housing.This ranges from 
 small flats and terraced houses,      
 designed as starter homes for the     
 newly married or single,to large,five_
 bedroomed,family homes.Architectural  
 styles vary considerably.             
 The development is served by a spine  
 road,a large supermarket,a community  
 centre and a primary school.Older     
 children attend secondary schools in  
 Wokingham and district.
