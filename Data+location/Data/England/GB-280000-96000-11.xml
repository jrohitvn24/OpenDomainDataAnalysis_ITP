		<content> We went through the gate and went     
 down a steep driveway to the convent, 
 it is really like a large house. We   
 went in and looked at some slides with
 most of the things on it that the     
 nuns did.Like doing bees honey and    
 gardening,and it also showed most of  
 the flowers they had. We went out into
 the garden it was 3 acres altogether. 
 it had about 4 ponds with             
 water forgetmenots. A little further  
 on was the vegetable patch in it was  
 lettuce, carrots, cabbages, peas,     
 broad beans.The nuns do  all their own
 farming they even have their own      
 tractor to use.They use every piece of
 land for growing crops and vegetables,
 keeping chickens,bees and usually pigs
 and sometimes cows. Pheasants come and
 steal some of their crops!            
  We then went inside to meet all the  
 sisters.There are six of them.        </content>
