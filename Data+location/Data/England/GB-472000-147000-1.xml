 OUR BLOCK IS A RURAL AREA. THERE      
 ARE A PAIR OF TWO SMALL VILLAGES, LONG
 SUTTON AND SOUTH WARNBOROUGH, AND A   
 PART OF A SMALL ESTATE OF MARRIED     
 QUARTERS. THE HOUSES IN THE VILLAGE   
 ARE MAINLY QUITE OLD BUT THERE IS     
 ONE SMALL MODERN DEVELOPMENT.THERE ARE
 NO EXTENSIVE SHOPPING FACILITIES,OR   
 RECREATIONAL AMENITIES AND NO INDUSTRY
 EXCEPT FOR FARMING WHICH IS MIXED.    
 MOST OF THE LAND IS OPEN ROLLING      
 COUNTRY SIDE WITH A FEW CLUMPS OF     
 TREES AND HEDGES. THE R.A.F. AIRFIELD 
 COVERS MOSTOF THE LAND TO THE NORTH OF
 THE BLOCK AND THIS IS FAIRLY FLAT AND 
 OPEN. THERE ARE GOOD ROAD AND RAIL    
 LINKS ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY WHICH    
 MAKES LONDON,  40 MILES TO THE E.N.E.,
 EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO COMMUTERS WHO    
 LIVE IN GREAT NUMBERS IN THE AREA.
