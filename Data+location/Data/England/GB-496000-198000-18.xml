		<title>18 A DAY OF AN 8 YEAR OLD</title>
		<content>In the morning I get up at 6.30.I am   
woken up by my father as I have't got  
an alarm clock.I am downstairs by 7.45 
and I pack my lunch box.Then I have my 
breakfast.I have toast  and hot        
chocolate. Then I feed my rabbit.I then
put my coat on and travel to school by 
car.I am usually at school early.When I
am working I like to talk a bit.My     
favourite work on Friday is Fletcher(  
a maths scheme).After that I go out to 
play after which Mrs Farr reads me a   
story.Then we go home.At home sometimes
Ihave a friend to play or I go out to  
play. I go to bed at 8.30pm.When I have
changed into my pyjamas mummy reads us 
a story.Sometimes before that we have  
a bath. Kate aged 8
