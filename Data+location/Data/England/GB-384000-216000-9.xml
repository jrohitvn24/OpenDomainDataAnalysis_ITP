		<content>{My Church:}I go to Trinity Baptist    
 Church.We sing a hymn,then pray,then  
 another hymn followed by an offering  
 and then another hymn.The man preaches
 about the Bible and I became a        
 Christian so I was saved.             
{My Sunday School:}On a Sunday morning 
 I get up early to go to Sunday        
 School.My mum takes me.I started      
 because I am a Christian.I was saved  
 from sin.We do lots of things and do  
 plays about the Bible,like walking on 
 water.After Sunday School we go into  
 church and are blessed.               
{The Mosque:}I{have}to go to church.It 
 is no ordinary church,it is a mosque. 
 It is the most important thing for the
 Moslems,who worship Mohammed,"peace be
 on him".When we are in the mosque we  
 have to read our Subuck.When we read  
 this to our teacher and we do not know
 it we get the stick.                  </content>
