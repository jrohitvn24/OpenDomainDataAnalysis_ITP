		<title>12Parish Council.Middleton</title>
		<content>  Middleton and North Runcton have     
 Parish Councils which provide things  
 like bus shelters,cutting of the      
 village green(North Runcton), and     
 upkeep of the playing field and       
 churchyard(Middleton).                
  There are nine parish councillors at 
 Middleton and six at North Runcton.   
 They are local people,{elected}every  
 four years and unpaid.  Each Parish   
 Council meets every month.            
  Parish Councils raise money by{local 
{rates}and also sometimes receive      
 grants from District and County       
 Councils. An important part of their  
 work is concerned with getting        
 District and County Councils to       
 improve their services to the village 
  The Parish Councillors we spoke to   
 said that they liked serving the      
 village but that few people are       
 willing to become councillors.        </content>
