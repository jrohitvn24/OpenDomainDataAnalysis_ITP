		<content> Other than those involved in farming  
 most people go out of the area to     
 work. Some people work in Totnes but  
 others travel as far as Plymouth,     
 Torbay, and Dartmouth. Those who      
 choose to live in the area and travel 
 to work tend to be professional       
 people, particularly among the younger
 families.                             
                                       
 Although there is some unemployment   
 seasonal part time work connected with
 tourism or farming is available.      
                                       
 A few people are self employed in a   
 "handy man" capacity.
