		<content> Yesterday was a public holiday.I got  
 up at 9.45am,went downstairs to the   
 kitchen and let the dog out into the  
 garden.I then got washed and dressed  
 and had my breakfast of Alpen,juice   
 and toasted cheese.I played my        
 favourite tapes on the stereo till    
 lunchtime when I had soup,toast and   
 juice.Mum and I then drove to the     
 clubhouse to play golf.We played 6    
 holes.I did not play well!We then went
 visiting a friend of Mum's for a while
 and I started weeding the garden      
 when I arrived home.I took my shoes   
 and socks off and my dog pinched them!
 Soon Dad shouted,"Tea." For tea we had
 spaghetti bolognese. After tea I      
 watched a programme on televison      
 called 'The World's Strongest Man' and
 then a film called'Hawk the Slayer.'
