		<title>20The Nicky-Nack</title>
		<content>{There are several stories of how the  
{Nicky-Nack got its name. This is one. 
   One day, a man drove along the road 
 with his horse and cart on his way    
 from market. He saw an old lady and   
 stopped to give her a lift. As they   
 rode along he heard a strange noise   
 --- 'nickety-nack, nickety nack' ---  
 He turned around and saw that the old 
 woman was really a man. He had a knife
 and was fingering it as they rode     
 along, obviously up to no good. He    
 thought that the man was going to     
 murder him so he pushed him off the   
 cart and rodeon quickly. But the      
 noise continued. It was the noise of  
 the horses shoes on the cobbled road  
 outside of the inn. They went ---     
 'nickety-nack, nickety-nack' --- on   
 the cobbles.
