		<title>12GULVAL CHURCHTOWN</title>
		<content> Gulval has a{Parish Church,}so the    
 part of the village near the church is
 called{Churchtown.}It is named after  
{St.Gudwal}who first brought           
 Christianity to the area. Parts of the
 Church were built in Norman times. The
 stonework is granite with stained     
 glass windows. The lychgate leads into
 the original churchyard which encloses
 the church. Burials take place in the 
 larger churchyard across the road.    
                                       
 Some of the houses surrounding        
 the church were built about 100 years 
 ago by the Bolitho family, who owned  
 much of the land in the area. The     
 former blacksmith's forge has been a  
 private house for 80 years.{Landicla  
{Manor}is recorded in the original     
 Domesday Book, and a modern house on  
 the site still has the same name.
