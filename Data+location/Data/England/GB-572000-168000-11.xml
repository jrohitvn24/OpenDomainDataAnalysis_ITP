		<title>11A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>  When we got home we turned on the    
television to watch the programme      
'Wonder Woman'. Then l had a drink of  
tea and had my dinner which was        
potatoes,sausagemeat and beans.  l     
finished my tea and cleared the table. 
At 6.55 we went to see my cousin and   
Granddad up at Shawswood (the old      
people's home).                        
  Later l arrived back home.I got ready
for bed at 9.01. My Mum read me another
chapter of the Â£Folk of the Faraway    
Tree'. After she had finished l turned 
off the light at 9.15 and went to bed.
