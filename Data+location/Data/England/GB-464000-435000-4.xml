		<title>04Riccall Disused Airfield</title>
		<content>A local man's first job, at the age of 
fourteen, was working on the runway. He
said that the first aeroplane to land  
at Riccall was a Lancaster Bomber which
had flown from Aldershot. Its landing  
was intended to test the runway.       
However by the time the Lancaster      
touched down, the sun had melted part  
of the runway's surface. The surface   
cracked on impact and it had to be     
re-surfaced! During the war,the        
airfield was used for storing bombs and
ammunition a included a bomb-dispersal 
unit.The site of this unit is now      
Beaumont's scrapyard.A few years ago, a
de-activated bomb was found in the     
scrapyard. Also during the war, part of
King Rudding Lane was closed so that   
ammunition could be moved in safety.
