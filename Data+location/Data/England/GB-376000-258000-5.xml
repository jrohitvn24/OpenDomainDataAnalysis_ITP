		<title>05WICHENFORD VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content>{Wichenford's population is varied.    
 There are many{elderly residents,}and 
 with the housing estates, quite a few 
{young families.}New private homes have
 been built by{Worcester businessmen.  
{Life styles also vary.}Traditionally a
 farming community, many{farmers}and   
 farm workers still enjoy the village. 
 The Council houses are occupied by    
{town dwellers}who use Martley, Hallow 
 and Worcester more, and new residents 
 tend to{commute to Worcester}where    
 their children attend{private schools.
 Some interesting{house restoration}is 
 seen in older buildings, one fine     
 example is{The Forge.}This 350 year   
 old{farm house}has been carefully re- 
 constructed;{wooden beams}are exposed 
 and{wattle and daub}infill repaired   
 with brick. The original{smithy}is now
 a{Granny flat,}and an old{cider press 
 is set into the garden as a pond.     </content>
