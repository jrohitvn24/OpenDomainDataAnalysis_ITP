		<title>05THE STONEBOROUGH CENTRE</title>
		<content>   Opened late in 1976,{Stoneborough   
 (763556) soon established itself as a 
 major focus of Maidstone's shopping.  
   There are 3 main shopping levels,   
 connected by lifts, escalators and    
 stairs,and a permanent security staff.
 The pressure on Maidstone's other car 
 parks was eased by the centre's spaces
 for 1040 cars,260 of them on the roof.
 The roof also has office facilities.  
   Despite the centre's attractions it 
 has not become the pre-eminent        
 retailing centre. W.H.Smith has just  
 moved from{High Street}premises to the
 pedestrianised part of{Week Street,}  
 which was originally less favoured    
 than Stoneborough. Tesco has opened a 
 new hypermarket at{Lunsford Park}and  
 closed its supermarket in the Centre. 
 Meanwhile the new{Broadway Centre}over
 the bridge further complicates likely 
 future developments.                  </content>
