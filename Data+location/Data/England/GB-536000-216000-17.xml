		<title>17HIGH CROSS SCHOOL FETE.</title>
		<content> The annual summer fete took place on  
 Sunday 23rd June. The weather was dry 
 and sunny. The fete started with      
 lively music played by the Ware Brass 
 Band. There was a total of 38 stalls, 
 including "lucky-dip", "white-        
 elephant", "coconut-shy", "tombola",  
 "bingo", etc. In addition, there were 
 delicious cakes and ice-creams for    
 sale and it was possible to have pony 
 rides and have your face painted!. St.
 John's church was open, and was       
 colourfully decorated with flowers,   
 and the St. John's Ambulance service  
 were on hand, in case of emergencies. 
 The fete opened at 2-30pm and cost 20p
 to enter. It took place on the village
 school field, and refreshments were   
 available in the school itself. It was
 an enjoyable afternoon, being a       
 typical English village summer fete.
