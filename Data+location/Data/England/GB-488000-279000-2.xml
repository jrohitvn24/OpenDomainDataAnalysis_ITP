		<title>02The Duke of Buccleuch</title>
		<content>    Walter Francis John Montagu Douglas
Scott is the 9th. Duke of Buccleuch and
11th. of Queensberry.                  
    Buccleuch is pronounced Â£Buck-loo'.
    There have been Dukes of Buccleuch 
since 1663 when the title was created. 
    The present Duke was born on 28th. 
September 1923 and took on the title in
1973.    Unfortunately an accident has 
confined him to a wheelchair but this  
has not prevented him from leading a   
very full and active life.             
    He takes a keen interest in the    
Boughton Estate and his Scottish       
properties.                            
    His Grace's wish that people should
share the delights that Boughton House 
and Estate can offer has been much     
appreciated by all who visit and       
especially the many school parties     
during Estate open days.    2500       
children visited on two days in 1985.  </content>
