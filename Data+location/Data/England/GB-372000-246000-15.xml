		<content> The farm is divided into 2 parts.One  
 part is limestone and the other       
 sandstone.The limestone area is used  
 for grazing and some is woodland.There
 are 800 ewes and 20 rams.The farmer   
 hopes that each year the ewes will    
 produce 1300 lambs.Each lamb will be  
 sold for Â£40.The sheep are Cole Bred  
 and Suffolk.Also they keep cattle on  
 the farm for meat.They have mostly    
 Fresian and Holstein.They spend their 
 whole lives in barns.On the sandstone 
 side,wheat,barley and oats are grown, 
 also swede which will feed the sheep  
 and maize for corn on the cob.The     
 wheat is grown to make bread.Barley is
 for cattle feed.Oats are grown for    
 sheep feed.There are six tractors and 
 one combine-harvester.Only four men   
 are needed to work on this huge       
 farm,which is about 400 acres.
