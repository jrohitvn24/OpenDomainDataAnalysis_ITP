		<content>{ST. MARK'S CHURCH}is a modern Church  
 of England building. It was           
 established in the 1960's as a        
 temporary building to cater for the   
 new Queensway estate. A permanent     
 building was completed in the late    
 1970's and the Church is now an active
 part of the community in this part of 
 Wellingborough.                       
 Church of England services are        
 conducted by priests who after a      
 period of study at theological college
 are ordained by a Bishop. After a time
 of apprenticeship in a parish as      
 curate to the priest, it is then      
 possible for an ordained person to    
 have charge of a parish of his own.
