		<content>   Of the original industries only one 
Brickworks remains. This has had       
complete new plant installed though the
clay is now brought by road from a site
a few miles away.                      
   Of the new industries the small     
firms seem to be thriving and          
increasing in number. The principal    
ones i.e.longest surviving, are in     
light engineering and welding - making 
specific parts for the Aero industry,  
mining and welding equipment; others   
specialise in contract work.           
   Other factories are as varied as    
their numbers making: Choc Ices, Cans, 
Pizzas, Cardboard Boxes, Cosmetics,    
Greetings Cards, Plastic Containers,   
Disposable cups, Crisps, Varnish,      
Cleaning Materials, Cement, Packaging  
   The majority of employees are women 
working days and nights, very often on 
a part-time basis                      </content>
