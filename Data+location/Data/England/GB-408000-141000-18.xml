		<title>18TRAFFIC COUNT ON THE A303.</title>
		<content> A traffic count was made at           
 Winterbourne Stoke Hill on the A303,  
 which is a single carriageway main    
 trunk route between London and the    
 West of England.                      
 The count was taken at peak holiday   
 time on a sunny Saturday morning in   
 August 1985.                          
 The count of vehicles in both         
 directions per hour was as follows:   
   Cars travelling West      =  934    
   Caravans travelling West  =   60    
   Coaches travelling West   =    4    
   Lorries travelling West   =    0    
   Cars travelling East      =  806    
   Caravans travelling East  =   52    
   Coaches travelling East   =   12    
   Lorries travelling East   =   78    
 The traffic was flowing quite steadily
 at approximately 40 m.p.h. with no    
 major hold ups.                       
                                       </content>
