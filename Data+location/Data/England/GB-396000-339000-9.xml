Blythe Colours is situated seven miles 
south of the City of Stoke-on-Trent in 
the village of Cresswell, a peaceful   
little place which has a church, a pub,
a few small farms and a community of a 
hundred or so people. Winding it's way 
through the fields is the river Blythe 
which is the main reason  why Blythe   
Colours was built there. What is now a 
vital twenty acres of industrial and   
commercial activity was once the site  
of a waterwheel and a small brick shed 
housing a few grinding pans.           
                                       
Now their products are transported all 
over the world by road, rail, air and  
sea.
