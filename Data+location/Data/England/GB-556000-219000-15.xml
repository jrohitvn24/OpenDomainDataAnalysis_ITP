		<title>15LITTLE CANFIELD, THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Little Canfield no longer has any     
 shops or retail outlets, the school   
 has closed as has the Post Office and 
 the village has become an isolated    
 community.  Several of the cottages   
 are now owned by weekenders and the   
 old community spirit is dying away.   
 Small country cottages have been      
 bought as investment properties       
 renovated, extended and sold at very  
 high prices beyond the means of the   
 local working population.  There is   
 still a village hall which provides   
 accommodation for local groups to     
 socialise, and at present acts as     
 the church. There are also allotments 
 at Little Canfield which are carefully
 tended by local people.
