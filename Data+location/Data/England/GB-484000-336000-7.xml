		<content> The fields in our D block are mainly  
 arable. The fields vary in size from  
 six to forty acres. The main crops are
 barley, wheat, oilseed rape and peas. 
 When the corn is harvested it is sent 
 to Swallow's corn merchants in        
 Grantham. Grass is grown for silage   
 for cattle feed. Peas and linseed are 
 used as break crops on light ground,  
 and oilseed rape is used as a break   
 crop on heavy ground. In the grass    
 fields there are mainly cattle which  
 are kept for their meat.  The farmers 
 in our D block use modern machinery   
 such as combine harvesters, tractors, 
 bailers, sprayers and fertilizer      
 spreaders.  Modern machinery means    
 not many people are employed on the   
 farms. At Breeder Hills Farm (300     
 acres) there are two full time workers
 and one student.
