		<title>11SHOPKEEPERS IN WADDINGTON</title>
		<content>   Shopkeepers in Waddington have a    
 difficult time becouse many of the    
 local people do much of their shopping
 at the big stores in Lincoln. Some of 
 the shops in lower Waddington have    
 closed down recently and the shops in 
 upper Waddington have found things    
 particularly difficult because of the 
 reduction in servicemen at R.A.F.     
 Waddington. Some shop assistants have 
 been made redundant.                  
  In order to compete, the shops tend  
 to concentrate on things other than   
 food and to provide items that the big
 shops do not. There are several fancy 
 goods and wool shops in Waddington,   
 for instance.                         
   Also, to attract custom, the        
 shopkeepers must be willing to keep   
 their shops attractiuely arranged and 
 to spend time chatting with their     
 customers.                            </content>
