		<content>      St. Blazey is a town of council  
 owned houses, leased to the people who
 cannot purchase their own home. Some  
 houses have been bought by the        
 inhabitants, and look better than the 
 rest, whih are a little dirty, due to 
 the couclil being the only people to  
 redecorate them.                      
      The majority of land cover is    
 farmland,and very small communities   
 called hamlets.                       
      In the Par area, the land is very
 low, maybe only a few metres above    
 sea-level,but near to St. Blazey, the 
 land rises and in fact the town is on 
 a gentle hill. In the North and West  
 the land is very hilly, but is flatter
 to the South and East.
