		<content>{As in any transition area}between an  
 inner city and the suburbs,a region of
 very mixed population will occur.This 
 area is no exception.Around the       
{University}there is a region of       
{transient population}as would be      
 expected.In a questionnaire asking    
 students for how many weeks a year    
 they lived in Birmingham over{75%}of  
 those asked said they lived in the    
 area for between 30-35 weeks a year,  
 just under 2% for between 36-40 weeks 
 and for the whole year only 8%.However
 this type of population in the Selly  
 Oak area contrasts with the areas of  
{Bournbrook and Moseley}where          
 population is more stable and         
 predominately middle class.This region
 also has a very high proportion of    
 immigrants who originally came from   
 the{Indian sub-continent}and the{West 
{Indies.                               </content>
