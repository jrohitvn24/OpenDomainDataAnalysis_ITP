		<title>14The River Ure</title>
		<content> My dad owns a marina which is called  
 Tower Marine.It is a small private    
 place where you can buy or sell boats.
 The marina can run out to the river or
 out to the canal.The river used to be 
 used for transport when there were no 
 cars but is now used for pleasure.My  
 grandad helps my dad in the shop so   
 it's really a family buisness.Potters 
 sand and gravel firm have a barge to  
 dredge the river for sand.The river   
 Ure runs from the Yorkshire Dales     
 through Boroughbridge down to the     
 river Ouse and into York.The pollution
 from the engines kills all the fish   
 and lead weights from fishing are     
 swallowed by swans and that kills     
 them.The river is used for different  
 uses and we should help to look after 
 it.
