		<content> Mr. Tom Richardson is the River       
 Bailiff on the River Wye in Monsal    
 Dale. He has been employed by the     
 Chatsworth Estate for eleven years.   
 His 'beat' consists of the stretch of 
 the River from Cressbrook Mill to     
 just above Ashford in the Water.      
   His job is to patrol the river to   
 check on the birds the plant life and 
 the fish stock. Fishing is strictly   
 limited to people with permits and Mr.
 Richardson spends time checking       
 permits, meeting the fishermen and    
 offering advice.                      
 Each day he write up detailed notes on
 the days fishing.                     
 He also keeps in touch with local     
 farmers and works in conjunction with 
 the other river bailiffs and the Peak 
 District Ranger Service.
