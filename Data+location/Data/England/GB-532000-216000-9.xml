		<content>The Company applied for planning       
permission to dig the quarry. It was   
granted and they bought the land       
freehold from Downfield Farm. Then they
purchased a washing and grading plant  
which was erected on the site.Boreholes
were sunk through to the chalk which   
lies under the gravel to obtain water. 
In all the plant uses 20,000 gallons of
water a minute from the boreholes and  
the River Rib, which is recycled.      
Dragline and hydraulic excavators dig  
out the sand and gravel which is now   
transported to the washing and grading 
plant by 20ton dumper trucks.          
Previously conveyor belts did the job. 
Eleven men work on production and six  
more on the lorries. There is a manager
and one or two office staff. Training  
is given to young men. Work conditions 
and safety have improved over the      
years.                                 </content>
