		<title>02Trays Farm,Compton Dundon</title>
		<content>    Trays Farm is situated up a small  
 hill in Compton Dundon and is owned by
 Mr and Mrs Napper. It covers 180 acres
 of grassland and is a dairy farm with 
 90 Friesian cows and a few heifers    
 kept for beef.                        
    They employ one man from the       
 village as well as their two sons and 
 combine with another farm for silage  
 making, so avoiding the need for      
 employing other workers at certain    
 times in the year.                    
    The farm has a great deal of       
 equipment including four tractors and 
 trailers, one forage harvester and one
 bailer.If all their machinery was     
 bought new it would be worth Â£90,000. 
    The farmhouse itself is 350 years  
 old with a 12th Century chapel and a  
 17th Century barn on the side.
