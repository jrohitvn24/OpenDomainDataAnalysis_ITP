		<content>    The branch line to Stanley Flint   
Mill was a private line running        
alongside the main line for about a    
half a kilometre then it crossed over  
the Caldon Canal and through the fields
into the mill.To cross the canal a     
turntable bridge was erected.This was  
secured lengthways along the centre of 
the canal to allow boats to pass it on 
either side,and when needed for use, a 
plank was placed from the bank side to 
the centre of the bridge to allow a man
to cross and release the safety        
catches.The bridge was then turned by  
pulling and when in the right position 
the safety catches were set in their   
stops on the bank and towpath.The train
carried on across.Then the turntable   
was reset to its original position,and 
the operator returned to the bank      
across the plank.There are still the   
remains of the bridge there today.     </content>
