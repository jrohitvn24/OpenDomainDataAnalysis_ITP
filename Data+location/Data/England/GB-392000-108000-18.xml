		<title>18JOBS IN TARRANT VALLEY</title>
		<content> Because our block is mainly farmland  
 we guessed that most people who worked
 would be connected in some way or     
 other to agriculture.An old man we    
 talked to said that 50 years ago      
 nearly everyone in the houses or      
 cottages was a farm worker but that   
 this had changed.Machines had taken   
 over so fewer men were needed.Of the  
 people we asked about half were       
 working on farms,a lot worked in      
 offices or factories in Blandford,    
 Wimborne &amp; Poole while 1 person went  
 to London to work in an office and    
 only came home at weekends.Six people 
 worked at the Langton Arms public     
 house and and at the Crown in Tarrant 
 Hinton.There was one author,a post man
 and a director of a big firm. There   
 were also lots of retired people      
 especially in Tarrant Monkton.
