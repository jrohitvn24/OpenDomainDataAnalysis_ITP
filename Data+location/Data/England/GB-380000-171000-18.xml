		<content> Many things in the village of Colerne 
 have changed  during the last 900     
 years.                                
 There used to be a lot more woodland  
 and fields which have now been taken  
 over by housing estates. But there are
 still many things which remain how    
 they were 900 years ago, which include
 some of the hedgerow, streams and     
 rivers, footpaths and badger sets.    
 The eastern part of our area has been 
 declared a place of natural beauty so 
 any future building will be limited by
 the council.                          
 Colerne Park has recently been        
 protected by the Wildlife Fund, a few 
 years ago it used to be private but   
 now is open to the public. The        
 landscape is constantly being changed 
 by man, as this survey is being       
 compiled a few fields are being dug up
 for a water-pipeline.                 </content>
