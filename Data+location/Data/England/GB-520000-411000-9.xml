		<content> Mostly arable land, consisting of     
 Wheat, Barley, Oilseed Rape, and      
 Vining Peas. The small amount of      
 grassland produces beef cattle and fat
 lambs. Field sizes are usually 10     
 acres or much larger. Average yield   
 per acre of crops: Winter Wheat 3tons,
 Winter Barley 55cwt, Oilseed Rape     
 25cwt, Vining Peas 25cwt. Technology  
 plays an important part in producing  
 yields and great reliance is placed on
 artificial fertilizer and chemical    
 sprays. Land Drainage is also most    
 important and channels are regularly  
 cleaned. Most fields have been        
 underdrained. The majority of farms   
 are well equipped with machinery,     
 including diesel powered tractors from
 50HP to 150HP. Harvested produce is   
 usually stored on the farm after      
 harvest and sold during the year. App.
 employment is 1 man per 200 acres.    </content>
