		<title>02Culcheth Carnival</title>
		<content> In June every year there is a Carnival
 in Culcheth. There is a big procession
 of different floats all round the     
 village. The best dressed float won a 
 prize.  Some were funny, such as one  
 with pirates on who were squirting    
 water at everybody, and pretending to 
 drink beer. Other floats were         
 make-believe, like Humpty Dumpty and  
 Little Bo Peep. The procession ends on
 the field over the road from the High 
 School, and then the Carnival fair    
 starts.                               
 There are funny stalls like wet a     
 wally, when you throw a ball and if   
 you hit the container full of water it
 tips all over the wally(idiot!). These
 stalls are round the field's edge. In 
 the middle are activities such as     
 Morris dancing, a Brass Band, a Punch 
 and Judy show, and weight lifting.
