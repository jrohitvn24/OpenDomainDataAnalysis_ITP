		<content>  I rise at 7.30am I put on my school  
 uniform, a navy blue jumper, grey     
 skirt and white blouse. I go and get  
 my breakfast which is cereal. I eat my
 breakfast on my own. I have a wash and
 brush my hair. I walk to school with  
 my friends.                           
  At break I like playing a game called
 SPIDER. One person stands still and   
 the others hold onto his jumper and   
 keep on saying "SPIDER". Then when he 
 wants he says "poison in the bottle   
 123". Then you run, when he catches   
 someone he holds their hand. If there 
 are four caught, they can split into  
 two's. The game ends when there is one
 person left. That person is it and the
 game starts again.                    
  School ends at 3.30pm. After school I
 call for my friend Debbie and we go   
 out to play.
