		<title>05JOBS IN WANSFORD AREA</title>
		<content>  From our questionnaire we found that 
 74% of the householders had jobs,24%  
 were retired and 2% were unemployed   
 obviously unemployment is very rare in
 this area.  Most of the people who    
 have jobs, work in Peterborough and   
 some even work in London.  Some people
 had employment in the Wansford area,  
 these included the butcher, policeman,
 antique dealer, hotelier and          
 agricultural workers.  The majority of
 the people in this area had well paid 
 jobs: engineers, accountants, company 
 managers, eye surgeon, solicitors and 
 they often work at home.  The people  
 who work furthest away from Wansford  
 and Yarwell generally work more hours.
 The average working person leaves     
 Wansford at 8.00 am and returns at    
 between 6.00-7.00 pm.  34% of the     
 people in Wansford area have another  
 worker in the household.              </content>
