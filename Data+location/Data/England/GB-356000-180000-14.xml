		<title>14A Patchway Family's Day</title>
		<content>   I usually get up first and wake my  
 sister up. We get dressed and go in   
 the garden to play tennis till 8.00am 
 when the rest of my family wake up.   
 Then my mum makes breakfast and then  
 we eat it and start to play tennis    
 again, whilst my mum washes up and my 
 dad studies. My brother watches me and
 my sister playing tennis. At dinner   
 Tom, Alice and I then eat our dinner  
 and mum and dad too.                  
   After dinner the whole family sit   
 down and watch television, then my dad
 goes up and studies for the rest of   
 the day, while I have a bath. After   
 that my brother has a bath and then my
 sister. My mum then makes tea and we  
 all sit down to eat it. We then all go
 to bed.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
