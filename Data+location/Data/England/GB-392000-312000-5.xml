		<title>05Hailing Dene and the Library</title>
		<content>The Hailing Dene is situated on the    
Cannock Road. It used to be an old     
house until it was changed for all of  
Penkridge to use. Now it has many      
rooms. Room 1 is a hall and is used for
wedding parties etc.. The Parish       
Council also meet here and disco       
dancing classes are held. The fourth   
and sixth Penkridge brownies have their
weekly meetings here.Some other brownie
packs meet in the other rooms. There is
a room where unemployed have their     
meetings. Weight training takes place  
in a small gymnasium. Other facilities 
include a bar selling beer and spirits.
We also have a Library near the        
Hailing Dene where you can join and    
borrow books providing you take them   
back on time. The Library is open 5    
days a week, closed on Sunday and      
Monday.
