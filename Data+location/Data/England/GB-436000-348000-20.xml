		<title>20HEAGE CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> The Carnival takes place in June and  
 was revived nine years ago.I look     
 forward to it.After assembly and      
 judging of floats the band heads the  
 parade around the village to the      
 school field.Each year has a special  
 event.This year it was a circus with  
 a trapeze artist,clowns,dogs,ponies,  
 llama,bear performing in the ring.    
 There were various stalls and         
 raffles.The band played in the ring   
 before the circus.A village girl was  
 chosen earlier at a disco,to be       
 carnival queen for the day with four  
 attendants.It involves all the village
 organisations with inter-club and pub 
 competitions.                         
 WELL DRESSING. "Preserving the Past"  
 was the second annual Well Dressing at
 Brook Street.Flower petals,bark,seeds,
 and leaves fixed on a bed of clay     
 depicted Crich Tram Museum.           </content>
