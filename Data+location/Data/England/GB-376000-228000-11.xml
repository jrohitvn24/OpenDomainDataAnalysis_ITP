		<content>  The largest house in our block is the
 Down House, a large mansion, but it is
 not open to the public. The smallest  
 houses are one bedroomed flats built  
 by the Council in 1980. The Council   
 also built flats for elderly people at
 Johnstone Close. There are 24 flats   
 and a warden who looks after the      
 residents.                            
  There were originally 80 Chartist    
 bungalows built in 1848 for working   
 people. Only 60 are left now. Since   
 1945 many new houses have been built  
 including a private estate of 40      
 houses, built 10 years ago, called    
 Compton Close. The Council also built 
 many other but most are privately     
 owned now.                            
  One of the oldest houses is called   
 Staunton Court. It was owned by Dick  
 Whittington's brother and was built in
 the 14th century.                     </content>
