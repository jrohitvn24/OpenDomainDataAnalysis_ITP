		<title>15MENDIP HOSPITAL 1</title>
		<content> The hospital was built at a time when 
 large mental institutions were seen as
 a means of removing people suffering  
 mental illness from the community, to 
 a place where they could be confined, 
 if not cured. "Mendip", as it is      
 locally known, stands on the N.E. edge
 of Wells in extensive grounds, which  
 with Victorian thoroughness, were used
 to grow vegetables and raise animals, 
 thus providing a healthy diet and     
 therapeutic exercise. The total area  
 of "Mendip" covers{300 acres}and was  
 purchased for{Â£35}in the middle of the
 l9th century.                         
 The hospital's early history was      
 focused on the treatment of local     
 people who worked in the{lead mining  
{industry}and suffered from the effects
 of heavy metal poisoning. This role   
 declined along with the industry.
