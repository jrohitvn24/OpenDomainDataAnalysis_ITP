		<title>03FARMING AND LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> The landscape of the farms we looked  
 at was mainly fields which grew cereal
 crops such as wheat and barley. There 
 were also a few grazing fields with   
 cows and horses grazing in them,there 
 were one or two ponds with ducks in   
 them.There were seven farms in the    
 area with some just in the boundary   
 because of their fields. The farms    
 were all old except for a relatively  
 new Aubers Farm which is situated in  
 Lower Sundon. The farms buildings or  
 barns appeared to be poorly maintained
 with holes in the roofs and walls,    
 some were abandoned.The land survey   
 was gently undurlating and all of it  
 was suitable for farming.Most of the  
 fields were about 4-5 acres and were  
 connected by roads which were of a    
 very poor quality.
