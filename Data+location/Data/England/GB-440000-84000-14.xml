		<content> A{HORSE DRINKING TROUGH}near the east 
 wall of the Sun Inn is dedicated to   
 the memory of Sir Barrington Simeon   
 who died in 1909.  Now it is used to  
 grow flowers.  The{VILLAGE PUMP}had   
 its roof restored to celebrate the    
 Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth 2nd in    
 1977. This is opposite the entrance to
 School Lane and is no longer used as a
 water supply. The{WAR MEMORIAL}was    
 erected in 1920 on the village green  
 south of the church to remember those 
 who died in the Great War from l914 to
 l918 and later names of the dead of   
 the war from 1939 to 1945 were added. 
 The{LONGSTONE}on the Down north of    
 Mottistone Church is believed to be   
 the oldest of man's constructions in  
 the Isle of Wight, it is also known as
 the Speakers Stone.
