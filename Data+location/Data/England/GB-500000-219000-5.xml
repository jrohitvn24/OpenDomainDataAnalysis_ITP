		<content> We  questioned fifty four people in   
 Dunstable. Twenty four were men,      
 thirty were woman. Quite a few people 
 did not own a car. The majority of    
 people owned foriegn cars but a       
 British company was in the top three. 
 Many drivers owned fairly new cars.   
 Most drivers have their cars serviced 
 at a garage but a suprising number    
 service their own cars. Most people   
 use four star petrol. Almost every    
 driver is disgusted with the price of 
 petrol. Most people use their car for 
 work, shopping and lesiure. Most      
 people like to use their seatbelt but 
 some break the law and dont wear it.  
 Almost everyone thought their driving 
 test was easy. Most people passed     
 their driving test at the first       
 attempt. Two thirds of the adults     
 didn't own a bicycle. Those who did   
 didn't use them very often.           </content>
