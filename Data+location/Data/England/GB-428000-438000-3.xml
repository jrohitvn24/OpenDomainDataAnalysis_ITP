		<content> PRIMARY SCHOOLS- This kind of         
 schooling follows straight after a    
 nursery in Leeds. The age range is 5  
 to 9 years.Most primary schools have a
 set uniform,but it is not always      
 compulsory.There is a choice between  
 school dinners and packed lunches from
 home in some schools.                 
 Pupils can learn many subjects        
 including Maths and English but       
 usually the lessons are not scheduled 
 in a timetable.Pupils are  set        
 in classes at random, not according to
 ability.                              
 The schools differ in time eg. some   
 start at 9 am. until 3.30pm.The       
 capacities of the schools are between 
 200-500 children.
