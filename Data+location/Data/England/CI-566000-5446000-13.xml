		<title>13The Merton Hotel</title>
		<content> During the war the hotel was used as a
 hospital for the German airforce, now 
 it is the{largest hotel}in our area.  
 Between June and September the Merton 
 takes in about{700 guests.}There is a 
 large extension being added to the    
 hotel this year. They have put in     
 tennis courts, a table tennis room,   
 squash courts and a Jacuzzi by the    
 pool. We have seen the workmen        
 working, building and painting the    
 inside and outside of the Merton. A   
 lot of children who live nearby use   
 the pool at the Merton. They have four
 diving boards, a ground-level one, a  
 three metre, a five metre and a ten   
 metre.
