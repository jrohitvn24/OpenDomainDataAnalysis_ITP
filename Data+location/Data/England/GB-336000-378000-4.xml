		<title>04  Eastham - St.Marys School</title>
		<content>    The school is in the middle of     
{Eastham Village}opposite St.Marys     
 Church.It is called {Eastham St.Marys 
{(Controlled) Primary School.}This     
 means that the school belongs to the  
 church but they give their permission 
 for the Local Authority to use it.    
    The building is mainly built from  
 sandstone and timber.Most of the      
 windows are very small and high up.   
    Inside the school there is a       
 shortage of space.For P.E. classrooms 
 have to be cleared so that they can   
 use the floor.There are carpets on    
 most floors because the old           
 floorboards splinter very easily.     
    In all of the school there are 79  
 children and only 3.5 teachers.       
    Behind the outside toilets there is
 a garden and play area which has been 
 designed by the children.
