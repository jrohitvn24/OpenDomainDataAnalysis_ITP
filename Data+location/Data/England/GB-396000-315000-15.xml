		<content>    After talking to the mounted police
we interviewed the police scramble bike
rider.                                 
    His Honda 250 scramble bike cost   
1750 pounds and would be kept for about
5 years.                               
    The rider has a nine week training 
course, and is responsible for cleaning
and refuelling the bike. If the bike   
breaks down, they call a mechanic.     
    The rider wears leather boots with 
a metal plate in the sole to stop his  
feet from hurting when standing on the 
footrests. He also wears padded leather
breeches, leather jacket and gloves.   
His helmet is fitted with headphones   
and a microphone. The radio is strapped
to his chest.                          
   The bike travels quicker than a     
horse but is much noisier. It is used  
to chase motorcyclists who have ridden 
into the Chase's motorless zones.      </content>
