		<title>18PLAYGROUND GAMES, COVENTRY.</title>
		<content>   In each game one person is "on". He 
 must catch someone else to take his   
 place.                                
{OFF GROUND TIG.}You are only safe if  
 you are off ground. We use the logs by
 the playground.                       
{SCARECROW TIG.}You must keep running  
 about until you are caught. Then you  
 stand with your arms out. You can be  
 freed by someone running under your   
 arms. When you have been caught 3     
 times you are "on".                   
{LINE TIG.}We use the lines of the     
 netball court. One person  is a       
 traffic signal and calls out changes  
 of direction. You cannot go off the   
 lines or disobey the signals.         
{SEMI CIRCLE TIG.}The safe areas are   
 the semi circles on the playground.   
 You must get from one to the other    
 without being caught.                 
                                       </content>
