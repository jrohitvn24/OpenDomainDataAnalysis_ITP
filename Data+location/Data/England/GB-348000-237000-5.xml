		<content>   On July 5th we visited Hereford     
 Cathedral, and the first person we    
 met was the{Precentor.}He told us all 
 about the work that goes on in the    
 Cathedral. He said there are 101      
 different jobs to be done.            
   The Precentor looks after the Choir 
 and oversees the activities that go on
 in the Cathedral.The Precentor is     
 called a{Canon.                       
   The{Verger}helps keep the Cathedral 
 clean. He carries a very heavy mace   
 and wears a black and blue robe.      
   The Cathedral has been damaged      
 throughout the years and Herefordians 
 have been raising money for repairs.  
 On 8th April 1985 the{Prince and      
{Princess of Wales}visited the City to 
 open the Restoration Fund.            
   The Cathedral is the Mother Church  
 of all the Churches in the Hereford   
{Diocese.                              </content>
