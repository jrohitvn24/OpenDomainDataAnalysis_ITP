		<title>10Tourism in Wetton</title>
		<content>     Tourism in Wetton is a large      
trade.  There are more tourists in     
summer than in winter.  Some tourists  
do damage to Wetton.  For example, they
knock down walls and write on public   
toilet walls.  They also trample down  
mowing grass and sometimes smash glass 
bottles in the fields which can damage 
the cows and sheep.  It can especially 
damage the sheep if they are in lamb,  
because it can make the sheep's lamb   
stillborn, which means the lamb is born
dead.  They throw litter and they      
sometimes trespass on private property.
The people at large don't seem to      
realise that a lot of tourists come to 
Wetton all year round.  If tourists    
bring their dogs on holiday, they      
sometimes chase after the sheep.  It   
could damage the sheep badly.  Shop    
owners do a good trade in summer but   
not a lot in winter.                   </content>
