{HOLT}HAS TWO HALLS, they are the      
 Parish Hall and the Village Hall. The 
 Village Hall used to be a school but  
 it was closed down. The Parish Hall   
 belongs to the church and is used for 
 clubs.                                
                                       
{CHAPEL}                               
 A charter was found in 1368 that      
 records that there was a church in    
 Holt. In 1835 the chapel was knocked  
 down, extended and rebuilt in stone.  
 When the church was rebuilt it had    
 enough seats for 319 people. In 1985  
 the congregation number was 50. The   
 original plan was to have 600 seats,  
 but the idea never developed.
