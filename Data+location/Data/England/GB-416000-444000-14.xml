		<content> In the second World War there was much
 more industry in Otley. Many of the   
 industries were in engineering. Quite 
 a few of the engineering works made   
 weapons or other items to help        
 soldiers.                             
    Since the war, thefts have         
 increased and a lot of surrounding    
 countryside has gone. There did not   
 used to be any factories along Pool   
 Road.                                 
    Otley Show used to be held where   
 the rugby field on Pool Road now      
 stands. The cattle for the market were
 brought into Otley by train instead of
 by lorries.                           
    Before the bus station was built   
 the buses used to run from in front of
 the Conservative Club.Many of the     
 new schools have been built since the 
 Second World War.
