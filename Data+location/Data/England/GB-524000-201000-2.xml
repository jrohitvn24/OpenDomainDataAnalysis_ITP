		<title>02My Neighbourhood</title>
		<content> My neighbourhood is very nice exept   
 for Jack because every time you play  
 football and it goes on his grass he  
 comes out and moans. Normally on      
 Saturday every body is out            
 _Julie,Tracy,Jack,Daniel and me. The  
 nicest people are the Biddulphs       
 because we go out with them.Alan and  
 I play with Robert and Daniel.        
 My next door neighbours are Lorraine  
 and John on one side and Muriel and   
 Ted on the other side.They are very   
 nice. At night time when we are out we
 have to be quiet because there are    
 lots of babies, but I like where I    
 live.
