		<title>06THE COOPERS ARMS</title>
		<content> The Coopers Arms is a pub in Barthomew
 street. It is a tenanted pub owned by 
 Courage Breweries. Mr Saunders,the    
 tenant,looks after the pub and employs
 twelve part-timers. The price of      
 drinks has trebled in the past ten    
 years.A measure of whisky costs 60p   
 and a pint of lager 79p. Fashions have
 changed over the years;bitter beer is 
 less popular and lager more so.Also   
 beer comes in metal kegs instead of   
 barrels.These are much easier to work 
 with but the beer is more gassy.The   
 pub opens from 10.30am to 2.30pm and  
 then closes,and opens from 5.30pm to  
 11.00pm. The tenant has to have a     
 licence to sell spirits and has to    
 maintain a certain standard of        
 hygiene. The pub building has been    
 standing for 350 years but hasn't     
 always been a pub. Supplies are       
 delivered once a week.                </content>
