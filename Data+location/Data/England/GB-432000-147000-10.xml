		<content> Our parents like to know how we do at 
 shool.  They are given small booklets 
 called reports.  Each teacher will    
 fill in a paper like this:            
                                       
{Name:  Lisa Hall.   Subject: R.S.

{Achievement:  B-    Effort:  1        
                                       
{Lisa works well in class.  The        
{examination result was pleasing.

 very good.  B is good.  C is fair and
