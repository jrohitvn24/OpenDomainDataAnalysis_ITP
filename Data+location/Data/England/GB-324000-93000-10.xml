 and skirting boards alone.            
 Roads-Proposed traffic lights for     
 Colyton have dropped down the county

 had their debt cleared by a donation  
 of Â£1500 by Abbeyfield Society Ltd.   
 in Colyton.A second hand ambulance was
 to be bought but a new Ford Transit   
 was bought and converted.This was
