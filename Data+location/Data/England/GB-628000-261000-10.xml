there is much less wildlife even than  
30 years ago. Farmers have amalgamated 
fields by taking out hedgerows and     
filling  in the ditches. The loss in   
nesting sites has affected the bird    
and animal populations. Sprays have    
reduced the numbers of wild flowers,   
particularly the patches of stinging   
nettles which are the homes of many    
butterflies.                           
Nevertheless hedge parsley(called sheep
parsley in Suffolk), adorns the sides  
of country lanes in May, and many other
traditional plants continue to flourish
away from sprayed areas. The wild      
primrose is much admired by visitors.  
Each year flocks of migratory swallows,
swifts and house-martins join the      
resident bird population. A farm in the
east of our surveyed area has won a    
conservation award planting new trees. </content>
