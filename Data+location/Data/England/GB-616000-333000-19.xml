		<content>  Strawberry picking in July can either
 be "Pick your own" or picking to earn 
 money.In P.Y.O. people arrive with    
 containers and set about picking, when
 they have enough the fruit is weighed,
 paid for and taken home for jamming   
 or for the freezer. To earn money is  
 harder work with a man in charge to   
 see each row is picked 'clean' and    
 that you do not eat the fruit. People 
 work at the apple orchard owned by Mr 
 and Mrs Barclay in Aldbourough. Mr    
 Barclay's father bought the farm in   
 1949 and planted 26 acres of coxs     
 orange and 8 acres of other varities. 
 He has 40 pickers in the late Summer- 
 being so far east the picking is 7- 10
 days later than the South.Early Summer
 people earn extra money 'Singling'    
 the beet this means taking out weaker 
 seedlings with a hoe, to make stronger
 plants.Account by Beverley,Adell,Marc.</content>
