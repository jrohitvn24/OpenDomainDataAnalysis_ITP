		<title>06St Annes - Housing contd.</title>
		<content>     In St Georges Road,St Georges     
 Square and Clifton Drive are some of  
 the Porritt-houses still              
 remaining.Built of Helmshore stone and
 yellowbrick.The highest tribute paid  
 to a man in the 1890's was that he was
 'as sound as a Porritt-house"         
    Property in St Annes differs       
 dramatically,for example in Church    
 Road the cottages,many of which have  
 been modernised,were occupied by      
 farmworkers and fishermen in the late 
 1870's.                               
     The majority of houses under      
 review are owner occupied.There are   
 several'bed-sits'in particular parts  
 and a small council estate lies just  
 outside the area.All types of housing 
 can be found in the area and recently 
 apartments have made an appearance.   
 prices range from Â£138,000 and above  
 on Inner Prom.To Â£12,000 for a flat.  </content>
