		<content> The study area is underlain by rocks  
 of the Triassic age except for a small
 part to the east of Gleaston and north
 of Newbiggin which has older          
 Carboniferous rocks.The Triassic rocks
 are mostly sandstone and the          
 Carboniferous are limestone.No solid  
 rock can be seen in the area because  
 of the thick deposits of glacial drift
 brought down during the Ice Age.The   
 rocks underlying the area have been   
 investigated by the Institute of      
 Geological Sciences with a borehole   
 near Gleaston.The beach contains      
 pebbles of limestone and sandstone    
 washed out of the glacial drift along 
 the coast by the sea.Also on the beach
 are pebbles that do not belong to the 
 area but have been brought in by sea  
 currents and tides.
