		<content>{Hillesley}is well named as there are  
 plenty of hills around. In the        
 Domesday Book of 1086 the village was 
 named HILEAHE. The village can be     
 quite self sufficient with a bakery   
 and grocers shop, Post Office, Radio  
 and T.V. shop, garage, public house,  
 restaurant, church, chapel and primary
 school. There are about 125 houses and
 5 farms in and around the village.    
{Alderley}is a small village without   
 any shops. there was an old manor     
 house which is now a private school.  
 There are about 21 houses, a letter   
 box in a wall and a church. About half
 a mile down the road is a trout farm. 
 A celebrity who used to live in the   
 village was Marion North, who painted 
 flowers of many countries. Her work   
 can be seen at Kew Gardens, London.
