		<title>16 Around the World on a Bike.</title>
		<content>                                       
           On Tuesday 3rd 1985, six    
children from Highfields School went   
to the local shops to meet a man called
Nick Sanders.He was going to try and   
ride around the World,on a bike,in     
eighty days.The children were Samantha,
Zoe,Vanessa,Vishav,Darren, and Carl.We 
asked why he was doing it. He said he  
was helping a charity called "Save the 
Children Fund" and was sponsored by a  
chain of Supermarkets.He was setting   
off from Manchester and was hoping for 
warm,sunny weather which would be cool 
enough to ride in.He was 27 years old  
and was most exited about going to     
Singapore.He said he was taking spare  
underpants with him.Afterwards we had  
our photograph taken with him and it   
appeared in the local newspaper.
