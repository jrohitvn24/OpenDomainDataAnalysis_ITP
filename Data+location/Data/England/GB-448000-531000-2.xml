		<title>02Dock Trade In Hartlepool</title>
		<content>      The first dock on the West       
 Hartlepool side of the bay was started
 in 1845.  All the docks on the West   
 Hartlepool side of the bay are 6 to 7 
 metres in depth.  All the inlets from 
 the sea have lock gates so that the   
 water level doesn't drop.  The docks  
 are in a semi-circle because that is  
 the shape of the bay.                 
      There are four docks in West     
 Hartlepool. Coal Dock, Jackson Dock,  
 Union Dock and Central Dock.  The Coal
 Dock is used for pleasure craft and   
 H.M.S. Warrior.  The busiest dock is  
 Union Dock because of all the car     
 imports.  Jackson Dock is bulk cargo  
 exports mainly to Spain.  Central Dock
 is used for car imports.              
      In 1982 Hartlepool Docks made    
 just over Â£1,000,000 profit.
