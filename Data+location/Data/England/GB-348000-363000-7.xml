		<content>   Within this survey area the only    
 place of worship is the Anglican      
 church of{St. Peter's}in Duddon.      
                                       
   This church was built in 1835 and   
 celebrates one hundred and fifty years
 of worship in October, 1985.  St.     
 Peter's is a "Chapel of Ease",        
 originally established to make        
 worship more accessible to those      
 living some distance from the parish  
 church of St. Andrew's, Tarvin.       
                                       
   The building is of red brick with   
 a tiled roof. The East window is a    
 stained glass one depicting Jesus, The
 Good Shepherd. The carved altar screen
 is dedicated to local people who were 
 killed in the First World War.  There 
 is also a notice board memorial to    
 those killed during the Second World  
 war.                                  </content>
