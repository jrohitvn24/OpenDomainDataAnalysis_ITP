		<content>         Middleton is situated six     
 miles north-east of Manchester and    
 about the same distance south-west of 
 Rochdale on the A664 road.            
         Middleton junction station a  
 mile out of the centre towards Oldham 
 provides rail links with Rochdale and 
 Manchester.                           
        The Rochdale Canal passes      
 through the town but this is no longer
 serviceable, being officially closed  
 to navigation in 1952.In places it is 
 now culverted.                        
       The M62 motorway linking Lancs. 
 with Yorks passes through the area,   
 and there is a service area at Birch. 
       A modern bus terminal provides  
 regular services to Manchester and    
 surrounding towns.Local buses also    
 link fringe housing developments with 
 the town centre.
