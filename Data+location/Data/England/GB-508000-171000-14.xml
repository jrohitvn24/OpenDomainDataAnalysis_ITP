		<content> My Mum came to England  from India in 
 1966. When she first arrived she lived
 in Kent before moving to Feltham.     
 When she first arrived there was very 
 little unemployment.Not many people   
 owned their own television instead    
 they rented them,also no one had a    
 video recorder or had even heard of   
 them. Central heating was very much of
 a luxury as many people stii had coal 
 fires.                                
 Violence on the television and in the 
 football grounds was far less frequent
 and also many more people went to the 
 cinema. Today many of the cinemas have
 closed down and become bingo-halls. My
 Mam also told me that when she first  
 arrived far more women stayed at home 
 to look after the house whereas today 
 they are more independant and many    
 have a career.
