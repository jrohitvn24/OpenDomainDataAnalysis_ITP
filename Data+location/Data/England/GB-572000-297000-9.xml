		<content> Leisure activities are very varied in 
 the village.Many activities are       
 centered around the home - gardening, 
 home maintenance and improvements,car 
 repairs.Reading and card playing are  
 popular pastimes paticularly during   
 winter evenings.There are also local  
 whist drives away from the village.   
 Anyone interested in swimming has to  
 travel to one of the local towns.     
 Other activities are connected with   
 the countryside - bird watching,      
 shooting,fishing,walking along the    
 local footpaths and studying buildings
 and churches.                         
 Many older people also enjoy a short  
 drive around the narrow lanes which   
 join the local villages.In this way   
 they may catch a glimpse of deer,     
 foxes,squirrels,pheasants and         
 hedgehogs - all of which can be seen  
 on occasions.                         </content>
