		<title>05HOUSING IN PENSBY</title>
		<content>     Prior to the 1920's Pensby was    
 mainly farmland and open fields, i.e. 
 a rural area.                         
     There was a "housing explosion"   
 in the late 1920's and 1930's. The    
 population rose, resulting in the need
 for a new school. Pensby County       
 Primary School was built in 1936.     
     There was a further "housing      
 explosion" in the 1960's. The 1936    
 school was not large enough so the    
 Juniors stayed in the old building and
 a new Infant School was build in 1964.
     Pensby is now mainly a built up   
 suburban area. Houses in Pensby are   
 mainly three bedroomed, semi-detached,
 two storey buildings with gardens and 
 a garage. Heating is mainly by gas.   
 Houses are mainly owner occupied. The 
 majority of houses built before the   
 1960's have been extended or          
 modernised.                           </content>
