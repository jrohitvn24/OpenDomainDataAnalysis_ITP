		<content>    In the countryside in our area     
 there are very few houses. There are  
 some cottages,some modern houses and  
 a few Georgian houses. There are no   
 villages in our area.                 
    There are about 3,000 to 4,000     
 houses in our area of Barnstaple. In  
 the town approximately half are       
 Victorian, one third are Modern and   
 one tenth are Georgian. These figures 
 do not include several new blocks of  
 flats.                                
    Many of the houses are Terraced    
 around our area.Some of these         
 Terraced Houses were built in the     
 Victorian days.                       
    Alot of houses are being demolished
 in Barnstaple to make way for a new   
 bypass. Some houses are now being     
 demolished near our Health Centre so  
 they can build some new flats.
