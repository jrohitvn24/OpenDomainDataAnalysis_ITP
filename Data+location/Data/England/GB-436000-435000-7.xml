		<title>07** SARAH'S DAY AT SCHOOL  **</title>
		<content>{A School Day In The Life Of Sarah.}   
 About 8 a.m. I woke up and it was     
 raining and very dull. My Mum shouted,
 "Get up!" I wanted to stay in bed but 
 I had to get up. I had my breakfast   
 and got ready for school. Then my     
 sister took me to school. I got to    
 school and I did some sums and I got  
 them all right.Then I did some English
 and History. At half past ten it was  
 playtime. We went out and played      
 skipping and when we came in we got   
 ready to play rounders. My team won.  
 When I had finished my work I went    
 down to eat my dinner and pudding.    
 Then we came in and said our prayers. 
 We put our chairs up and we went in to
 the hall and sang songs for twenty    
 minutes. Then we went back into our   
 classrooms and then we went home.
