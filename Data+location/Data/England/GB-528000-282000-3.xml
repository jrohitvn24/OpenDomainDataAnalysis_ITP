   The Parish Council is a committee of
 seven councillors democratically      
 elected to represent the  local       
 people.                               
   The council inform the District     
 Council of any faults in the roads and
 anything else that needs attending to.
 The Parish Council gets its funds from
 the District Council,the funds are    
 then spent on the roadworks and things
 of this nature.Every two months the   
 council meet at Bury school.          
   One member of the Parish Council,Mr.
 Bodle,who also runs Bury Post Office  
 thought that his job had not helped   
 him to gain his position on the       
 council but the council had helped him
 in his job.He thought this because he 
 worked locally.The council is         
 beneficial in the life of the area.   </content>
