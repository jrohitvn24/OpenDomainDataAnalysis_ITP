		<content> The whole is a sparsely populated area
 with predominantly small mixed farms, 
 deciduous woodland &amp; very few roads.  
 The central area is dominated by      
 Staunton Harold reservoir to which    
 there is public access for sailing,   
 fishing, walking,bird watching &amp;      
 picnicking.                           
 The outstanding feature is{Calke      
{Abbey,}an 18th century house on the   
 site of an ancient priory, recently   
 acquired by the National Trust and    
 available to the public on a limited  
 basis.                                
 A very interesting feature is the     
{Limeyards,}abandoned lime workings    
 whose quarries are now water-filled   
 and used for fishing.                 
 The whole area attracts many ramblers,
 photographers &amp; ornithologists.
