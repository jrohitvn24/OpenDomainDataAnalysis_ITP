		<content> The following is an extract from the {
{Wiltshire Gazette &amp; Herald}for 6 June 
 1985, under the title Sutton Benger on
 the Village News page.                
{Church Fete }                         
 Sunshine and the hard work of the     
 organisers made Saturday's Sutton     
 Benger church fete a record breaking  
 event.                                
 As well as the raffles and contests   
 there were 25 stalls, with Sutton     
 Benger Brownies running a special     
 stall for children.                   
 The Wiltshire Radio goodies van was an
 additional attraction, and the crowds 
 were entertained by the free-fall     
 parachute team from RAF Lyneham.      
 The record sum of Â£1,050 was raised.
