		<title>09CHILDREN'S CARNIVAL</title>
		<content>     The annual Children's Carnival in 
 CASTLE CARROCK, usually held in late  
 June, is organised by the Watson      
 Institute Management Committee.       
     Essentially a "day" for the       
 children, rather than a money-raising 
 event, it includes crowning of a      
 Carnival Queen, Fancy Dress           
 competition, children's races, pets'  
 corner, as well as other attractions  
 as available.   The "Queen" is chosen 
 by ballot from the girls who are due  
 to leave Castle Carrock school in     
 July.   The races are organised by the
 school staff with the prize money     
 provided by the Hall Committee to     
 offset which various stalls, sideshows
 and refreshments are operated.        
     The event is very popular with all
 ages and attracts support from all who
 live in Castle Carrock and beyond.
