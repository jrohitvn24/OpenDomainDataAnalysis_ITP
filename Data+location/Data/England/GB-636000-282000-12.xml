    Our house is 20 years old. Spexhall
means the hole of the woodpecker. In   
our garden we have 4 apple trees and 2 
pear trees. We also have 6 fir trees   
and 12 rose trees. In our house we have
2 bedrooms, 1 living room, 1 bathroom, 
1 kitchen and 1 hall. We have one      
snooker table, a stacking music centre 
and an ordinary music centre. We also  
have 1 trainset, a portable television,
a colour television and a video. When  
our house vwas built it was named after
Angus Wilkinson. His grandad built our 
house and named it Angus Lodge.
