		<title>12Homelife - Part 1</title>
		<content> Standard of home life is good &amp; due to
 efficient birth control families are  
 well planned &amp; inclined to be small.  
 As many men commute to work, and a    
 high proportion of women work outside 
 the home, several households run two  
 cars. One is often financed by the    
 employer. Where husbands are          
 commuters, wives have responsibility  
 of household. Husbands share care of  
 children, many being with wives during
 childbirth. Most homes have automatic 
 washing machines, freezers and        
 refrigerators, microwave ovens &amp; dish 
 washers are becoming popular. Cooking 
 is chiefly electric and calor gas,    
 wood burning stoves are also used     
 (more information under ENERGY). Bread
 &amp; milk are delivered 3 times a week,  
 post and newspapers daily.
