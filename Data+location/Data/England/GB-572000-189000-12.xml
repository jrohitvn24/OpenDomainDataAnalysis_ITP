		<title>12BASILDON NE: NORTHLANDS PARK</title>
		<content> The area has been developed as a      
 public park around connected large and
 small man-made lakes, there for land  
 drainage purposes. The local council  
 maintain and continually improve the  
 area. Several access points lead from 
 neighbouring estates. Small hills     
 provide views of surrounding areas.   
 Its many facilities include a         
 trimtrack for jogging, children's play
 equipment, picnic areas, crazy golf   
 and 'beach' areas. Small areas have   
 been left in their natural state to   
 encourage wild life. Ducks have raised
 their young among the reeds around the
 lakes. Various trees have been planted
 for landscaping purposes. Grassy areas
 are cut regularly. Life belts and     
 signs prohibiting boating and swimming
 are in prominent view for the personal
 safety of park patrons.
