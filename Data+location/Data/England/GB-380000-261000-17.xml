 The Anglican parish church of St.     
 Martin at Holt is the only place of   
 worship in this area. Reached bya long
 lane passing the quarry, it stands,   
 with Holt castle and farm buildings,  
 isolated from the communities in Holt 
 Heath and Holt Fleet. The Rector no   
 longer lives in the village but in    
 nearby village of Grimley,where he is 
 alsothe parish priest. However, this  
 beautiful little, mainly Norman church
 is very well cared for and there is at
 least one service according to the    
 rites of the Church of England every  
 Sunday.
