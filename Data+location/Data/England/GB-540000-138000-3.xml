		<title>03FARMING</title>
		<content> The sheep farm is of 66 acres arranged
 in five fields:one for their five cows
 one fallow,one for hay and the others 
 for the sheep using electric fences   
 for strip grazing. They have 250 sheep
 -Welsh Lleyn,Romney,Kent and British  
 Friesland.They have this last breed   
 because they are good milkers and     
 sheep's milk is becoming more and more
 popular with people who are allergic  
 to cow's milk.                        
 They have a sheep-dog which they had  
 to have trained , a terrier for       
 ratting and some chicken.             
 In summer the sheep are shorn by con- 
 tractors(who travel to Australia and  
 New Zealand in our winter),and the    
 wool is sold to the Wool Marketing    
 Board.
