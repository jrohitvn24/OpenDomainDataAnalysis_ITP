		<title>10A BABY IN GENERAL</title>
		<content> James has changed in many ways, he has
 lost his chubbiness. He has a way of  
 turning people on with his smile, he  
 sort of creases his nose,mouth and    
 eyes all in one.                      
 When he walks he totters a bit and    
 sometimes falls over, but he only     
 smiles and pulls himself up. He is    
 very curious and very adventurous. He 
 loves being cuddled and he also likes 
 being the centre of attraction. James 
 has a fancy for biscuits and knows in 
 which cupboard they are kept.         
 James knows simple commands           
 like'pattacake', 'wave' and when you  
 say "where's the baby?" He sometimes  
 looks up at the photograph of himself.
 If you say his name he will           
 immediately turn and look.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
