		<content>    12.7 percent of the Brocklesby     
 estate is woodland totalling 3,500    
 acres containing 300,000 trees. About 
 900 trees are planted on one acre when
 all the trees have been felled. The   
 oldest trees were planted 1889,being  
 96 years old. In 1985 11 acres were   
 felled in Pillar wood and a total of  
 900 mature, trees were felled.        
    Many trees are pulled. This is     
 known as 'thinning out'. It encourages
 the best trees to grow stronger. In   
 about 60 years time it will all be    
 broad leaved plants.                  
    Every five years the owners        
 proposed a plan of operations to the  
 Forestry Commision detailing the      
 proposed felling and thinning         
 operations which they hope to carry   
 out during the five year period. This 
 plan has to be approved by the F.C.   
 and also the County Planning Dept.    </content>
