		<title>08Launds Farm</title>
		<content> _Around 1900 Launds Farm house burned 
 down and rebuilt a few yards away form
 orignal site. Te farm manager at the  
 time was Mr Griffiths and fire started
 in the cart shed.                     
 Today we call this the Granary. The   
 name Launds as we spell it was spelt  
 Lawns and Lawnds. The biggest change  
 to the farm is roadway in, when Mr    
 Cliff took over the farm in 1937 the  
 road came through Ivy Farm and was    
 straight but very steep. if it rained 
 a horse and cart coudnt get out again 
 and so the roadway was made as it is  
 today but still only a dirt track but 
 had two bends and not quite as steep. 
 nowadays the road is tarmac.All the   
 fields at Launds fArm are still called
 by the original names, such as Five   
 Days Wrok, Shoulder of Mutton, Far Ox 
 Close, Newland and many more.
