		<title>04Talkin Tarn Country Park.</title>
		<content> In 1970, Cumbria County Council bought
 160 acres of woodland and farmland    
 which included 65 acres of water -    
 Talkin Tarn. In 1972 this became a    
 Country Park.                         
 The Tarn is 42ft (12.2m) at its       
 deepest point and is fed from         
 underwater springs. The distance      
 around the Tarn is 1+1/3 miles.       
 This beautiful area is well wooded    
 with excellent views of the fells in  
 the near distance.                    
 The fields are leased to farmers for  
 grazing. Nature lovers find plenty of 
 interest in the bird, animal and plant
 life.                                 
 As well as local people, between 60   
 and 70{thousand}visitors come annually
 from Carlisle and towns in the North  
 East.                                 
 A full time Warden and assistant are  
 employed there.                       </content>
