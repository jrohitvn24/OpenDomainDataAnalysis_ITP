		<content> Here are some questions we have asked 
 mr.N.Sorenson about his job and what  
 he thinks of schools in 1985 for the  
 BBC Domesday Project.                 
 The first question we asked him was   
 1) What do you work as ?              
  {A Community Tutor.                  
 2) What exactly do you do ?           
    I allow people to come and use the 
 school while it is not in use by the  
 pupils and teachers.                  
 3) Do you enjoy working as a Community
 Tutor ?                               
   Yes, it is different from teaching  
 in the classroom.                     
 4)How has{Westergate School}changed in
 the past few years that you have been 
 working here?                         
  The look of the school is more modern
 especially as you walk in and we have 
 built a shop .                        
                                       </content>
