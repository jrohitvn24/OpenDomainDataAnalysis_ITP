		<title>13BRAFFORD'S FARM CROPS.</title>
		<content>   On Brafford's Farm there are two    
 hundred and sevety seven acres of     
 arable land. The farmer grows winter  
 barley, winter wheat, potatoes, oil   
 seed rape and peas. The winter wheat, 
 winter barley and oil seed rape are   
 all drilled in September and harvested
 in July. The potatoes are drilled in  
 April and harvested in October. The   
 farmer grows peas for Bird's Eye, who 
 like tender garden peas the best. The 
 peas are vined by a viner. The viner  
 picks the peas and then splits out the
 pods. The empty pods and any other    
 waste go down a shute and come out at 
 the back of the viner. The peas are   
 stored in a tank in the viner. When   
 the tank is full, the peas are emptied
 into lorries and trailers and taken to
 the factory.
