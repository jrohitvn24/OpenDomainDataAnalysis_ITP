		<content> "When I came home there was rubble    
 behind the street door. For a minute I
 couldn't make out what had happened.I 
 thought we'd been burgled.We didn't   
 know what to do first.There was a big 
 hole in the roof and rain was coming  
 in everywhere.                        
 "The thunderbolt just chose our house.
 It blew the fuse on the electric      
 kettle and the C.B. The cat went deaf.
 "First of all we thought of ringing   
 our builder as rain was coming through
 the roof.The thunderbolt had blown the
 main fuse so we phoned the            
 electricians.I was in a bit of a dream
 _all these people in there.I was      
 making cups of tea and coffee."
