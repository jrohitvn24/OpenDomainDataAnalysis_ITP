		<content>FIRST INFRA-RED SIGHTING OF COMET      
HALLEY.                                
Dr.John Zarnecki of Kent's Space       
SciencesLaboratory has recently been   
involved in a unique observation of    
Halley's Comet.It was the first time   
that this singular,'once-in-a-lifetime'
comet has ever been detected by the    
infra red rather than the visible light
it emits,and the first observation for 
over 73 years carried out by a British 
astronomer of a comet named after one  
of Britain's most famous astronomers.  
The particular interest that the       
University has in this heavenly body   
stems from the experiment that its     
Space Sciences Laboratory is building  
for the European Space Agency's Halley 
encounter mission,named GIOTTO.
