{Hoyland is approximately 16,000.}The  
 mojority of the people are of the     
 working class group. In the past most 
 people were employed locally, nowadays
 because of closures of coal mines and 
 other small industries most of the    
 working population have to commute    
 in order to find employment. This has

 become unemployed through closures of 
 industries are having difficulty in   
 finding new employment. Signs of this

 centre of the town, men standing in   
 small groups on street corners,       
 housewives searching for bargains when
 shopping,youths frequenting the job   </content>
