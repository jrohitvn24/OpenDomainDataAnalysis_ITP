		<title>06PASHLEY FARM.</title>
		<content> At Pashley farm they do dairy farming 
 as well as growing potatoes, wheat,   
 grass and barley. They have rough     
 grazing and the farm has its own bull.
 They feed most of the crops to the    
 animals and if there is any surplus   
 they sell it. The people on the farm  
 get tested every year for T.B.        
  They have their own machines which   
 are:                                  
     3 tractors, 1 baler, 1 combine    
 harvester, 1 silager and 1            
 muck-spreader.

{   UPPER HOUSE FARM.                  
 There was only a joiner here and he   
 said that the farm had last been in   
 use 10 years ago. It is now a private 
 house.
