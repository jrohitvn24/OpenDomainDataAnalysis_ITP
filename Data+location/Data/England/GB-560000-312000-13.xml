		<title>13Minerals and building</title>
		<content> The soil is rich and dark alluvial    
 land, supplemented by the regular     
 dredgings from the rivers and the     
 cleanings from the ditches and dykes. 
                                       
 There is open-cast mineral working in 
 the south-east corner of the block, at
 Tottenhill Row. A fairly small scale  
 sand and gravel operation is carried  
 on, and a large gravel pit/lake has   
 been formed over the years.           
                                       
 There are virtually no stone outcrops 
 in the area, so buildings are         
 constructed of brick, except for some 
 very old stone cottages, and for the  
 school and two churches, all of stone.
