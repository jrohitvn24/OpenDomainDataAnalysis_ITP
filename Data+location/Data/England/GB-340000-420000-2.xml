		<title>02 Reclaimed Land Use</title>
		<content>                                       
    Mr Crook's reclamation has meant   
that the coast line has been           
changed,and a new O.S.map is being     
prepared as a result.                  
    On this land he grows cabbage,peas,
potatoes,sprouts,swedes,spring barley, 
and winter wheat,covering in total     
around 550 acres. Also, he has winter  
grazing for sheep.                     
    When this land was reclaimed,100   
miles of drains and 3 miles of road    
were laid,an electricity substation was
erected,and 200,000,000 pounds were    
spent.He also built the biggest farm   
building in Lancashire,measuring 250Â£  
by 100Â£ clear span.                    
    In the original Domesday Book there
is mention of the "Snotterstone",which 
was lost during the passage of time.   
During the excavations this stone was  
recovered,and will soon be on display. </content>
