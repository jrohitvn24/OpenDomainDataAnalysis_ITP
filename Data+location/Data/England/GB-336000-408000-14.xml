  The playing field has cricket and    
football pitches and a new pavilion is 
under construction. As well as swings, 
a slide and a roundabout, there are    
public toilets and a telephone. Other  
sporting favourites are squash, whist  
and dominoes as well as badminton.     
  The public house in Halsall is called
"The Halsall Arms" reflecting the close
ties with the village.                 
  The Leeds and Liverpool Canal        
provides leisure activities- boating   
and coarse fishing. There is an inn on 
the canal "The Ship Inn". The grand-   
father of a boy in our school worked on
the canal and was also a Clog Dancer - 
the origin of Tap dancing.
