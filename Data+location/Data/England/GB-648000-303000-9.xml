		<title>09PUBLIC OPINION IN BRADWELL</title>
		<content>   We interviewed the general public to
 find out what they thought of         
 Bradwell.Most of the people we        
 interviewed lived in Bradwell although
 only two had been born in the village.
   Nearly everyone we spoke to enjoyed 
 living in Bradwell. Things people     
 liked were the peace and quiet and the
 friendly atmosphere.                  
   Most people used the local shops;   
 the new supermarket being popular for 
 its variety of food and spacious      
 surroundings.                         
   People were equally divided in their
 opinion when we asked them if they    
 would like to see more shops opened in
 the village. Those who wanted more    
 shops felt they should be built on the
 new estates because the new houses    
 were a long way from the village      
 centre.                               
                                       </content>
