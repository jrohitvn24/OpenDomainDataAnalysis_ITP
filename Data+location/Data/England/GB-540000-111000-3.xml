		<content> Malling is almost{built}up{to its     
{limit}and has been growing for over 50
 years. The estate is divided into{old 
{and new}parts. Houses of varied styles
 are still being built in both areas.  
 Many different people live in Malling 
 including old people as there is a    
 home for them. Other ammenities       
 include a{school, newsagent, post     
{office}and{general stores.}People grow
 fruit and vegetables on{allotments.   
 Children play in the many open spaces,
 two small{woods}and recreation{park.  
 Malling Church is near to the{Sussex  
{Police Headquarters}whose private     
 sports ground can only be used by the 
 families of the police.{              
{Malling is not very accessible}as     
 there is only one road into it, being 
 almost surrounded by the river Ouse   
 which only has bridges in Lewes and   
 Barcombe.                             </content>
