		<title>06Life in Trumpington</title>
		<content>  Trumpington is a pleasant place to   
 live. The old area is the most        
 desirable part of Trumpington. We     
 studied it and found that the houses  
 add character to this traditional     
 village. Unfortunately this village is
 joined to its more modern looking     
 neighbour, Cambridge. In the middle of
 Trumpington is a church with a Sunday 
 school and a youth club across the    
 road.                                 
  There are two large stately homes,   
 one has been turned into offices, the 
 other is privately owned by the       
 Pemberton family who also own a large 
 amount of surrounding farmland.       
  However, Trumpington has little to   
 offer in the way of entertainment but 
 it is gradually being absorbed into   
 Cambridge.
