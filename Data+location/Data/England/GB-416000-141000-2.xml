		<title>02St Leonard's Church Bulford</title>
		<content>   St Leonard's church is one of our   
 oldest buildings.The archway leading  
 to the chancel and one lancet window  
 in the chancel date back to 1265.     
   In medieval times few people could  
 read,so the church walls were         
 decorated with pictures,traces of     
 which remain.When Oliver Cromwell     
 became ruler he ordered the plastering
 over of the pictures.In their place   
 the Puritans had to write the words of
 God.A part of the Ten Commandments    
 remains on the wall.                  
   The only stained glass windows date 
 from 1918 and are a memorial to the   
 Bulford men who died in World War 1.  
   It is the only non Garrison church  
 in Britain to be owned by the Ministry
 of Defence.
