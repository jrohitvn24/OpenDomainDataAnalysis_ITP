 Cotswold Hunt consists of 105 hounds  
 or 52.5 couples of hounds as they call
 them.The Cotswold Hunt is a group of  
 men and women who follow behind the   
 hunt.In this they hunt in a 15 mile   
 radius which consists of              
 Northleach,Cirencester,Stroud,Evesham 
 and many others.                      
   The hunt is where they catch        
 foxes.There are 14 horses invilved    
 from the Cotswold Hunt.There are many 
 other horses involved which are not   
 connected with the Hunt.When they go  
 out hunting they roughly catch a brace
 of foxes(3)in a week.                 
   The puppies are trained from 6 to 12
 months old.They are put out to walk at
 different farms in the hunting area.
