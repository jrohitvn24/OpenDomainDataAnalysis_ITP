		<title>09Changes in Horton.</title>
		<content> We talked to a man who has lived in   
 Horton all his life.He used to be a   
 Wheelwright.He said that in his time  
 (80 years) transport has changed a lot
 from horse pulled carts to cars to    
 concorde.The price of things has      
 changed as well- 80 years ago a       
 school dinner cost 1 penny now it     
 costs about 65p.80 years ago there    
 were 90 pupils in the local school now
 there are only 25,and the school has  
 to close down and the pupils are to go
 to Old Sodbury.But there is one thing 
 that has not changed,landscape.The man
 who we talked to said that a lot of   
 people say they are glad to see the   
 landscape has not changed but modern  
 transport is better because they have 
 to go into town to shop.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
