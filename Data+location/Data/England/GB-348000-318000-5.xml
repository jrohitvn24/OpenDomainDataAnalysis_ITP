		<content>      The ecology of the area is very  
 rich and varied.There are many        
 patches of woodland of all types, from
 the dense natural woodland on the     
 southern extension of {Pim Hill}in the
 north east of the block,to the sparse 
 scrubby woodland around {Plex, }which 
 is known as{Pigeon's Rough,}in the    
 centre of the block.                  
      Although most of the area is     
 intesively farmed  there are some very
 interesting ecological sites.One in   
 particular is a project to reclaim an 
 over grown pool in {Preston Gubbals.} 
 The pool is on the west side of the   
 main {A538}at the junction with the   
 road into {Preston Gubbals }village.  
 Old trees have been felled and new    
 broadleaved varieties planted, the    
 pool cleared,rank vagitation cut back 
 and controlled.
