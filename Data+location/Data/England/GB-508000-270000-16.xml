		<title>16SHOPPING IN WEST CAMBS.</title>
		<content>   The only shop in the area is the    
 small farm shop at Catworth Fruit     
 Farm, which offers a selection of     
 fruit and vegetables.   Stow Longa has
 no shop, but a mobile greengrocer's   
 shop visits the village weekly, and   
 the fish and chip van, which calls on 
 Saturdays, is also well patronised.   
                                       
   There are regular deliveries of meat
 and milk, except to the residents of  
 Little Catworth, who have nothing but 
 a monthly visit from a freezer van.   
                                       
   Kimbolton, three kilometres to the  
 South, offers more extensive shopping 
 facilities, but many people prefer to 
 shop at supermarkets and stores in the
 larger towns, where they can obtain a 
 wider range of goods at lower prices.
