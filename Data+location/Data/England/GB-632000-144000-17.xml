		<title>17RELIGIOUS PRACTICE TODAY</title>
		<content> There is little religious practice in 
 the 4 churches of the area. Only St   
 Margaret's has a moderately_sized     
 congregation and more than one weekly 
 service. Electoral Rolls and          
 Communicant Figures reveal less than  
 20 regular worshippers at E.Langdon   
 and Guston.  At West Cliffe the       
 services are fortnightly. There are   
 only 2 priests serving the 4 parishes 
 since St Margarte's,E.Langdon and West
 Cliffe are combined while Guston is   
 united with Whitfield. A large        
 proportion of practicing Christains   
 practice their faith in Dover,Deal and
 Canterbury. Religion has become       
 eclectic and the parish church has    
 become the preserve of those unable or
 unwilling to travel. There is a       
 Non_Conformist chapel at St Margraet's
 which has also suffered declining     
 attendance.                           </content>
