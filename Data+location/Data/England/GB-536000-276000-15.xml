		<content> SOMERSHAM IS SITUATED ON THE EDGE     
 OF THE FENS. TO THE NORTH-EAST LIES   
 THE TYPICAL LOW, FLAT  FEN COUNTRYSIDE
 GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING LARGE
 EXPANSES OF SKY WITH ITS VARIEID HUES 
 AND CLOUD FORMATIONS. MUCH OF THE LAND
 IS COVERED WITH OPEN FIELDS DIVIDED BY
 THE ODD HEDGE BUT OFTEN BY DYKES DUG  
 FOR DRAINAIGE. IN THE WINTER THE      
 FIELDS SHOW UP AS DARK BROWN WHEN THE 
 RICH PEAT SOIL HAS BEEN PLOUGHED. IN  
 THE SUMMER THE FIELDS ARE GREEN WITH  
 SUGAR BEET AND  VEGETABLES, BRIGHT    
 YELLOW WITH OIL SEED RAPE FLOWERS OR  
 GOLDEN WITH RIPE WHEAT.               
  A FEW TREES SHOW UP AGAINST THE      
 HORIZON AND THE ODD BUILDING IS       
 PROBABLY A FARM BUILDING OR COTTAGE.  
  BETWEEN SOMERSHAM AND COLNE THE      
 ORCHARDS LOOK THEIR BEST IN SPRING    
 WHEN IN BLOSSOM, OVERLOOKED BY THE    
 CHURCH TOWER WITH ITS SHORT SPIRE.    </content>
