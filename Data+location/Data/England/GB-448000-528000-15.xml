   The estate is located there because 
 it is near the edge of a town and so  
 land is cheaper.The council are giving
 grants to encourage firms to build    
 their factories in the town.Also there
 are built there because it was        
 allready flat land and that means they
 wouldn't have to pay money to get it  
 levelled.It provides easy access for  
 the workforce using either bus or     
 private transport.                    
   The changes that are occuring       
 involve the steelworks running        
 down,and the landscaping of wasteland 
 around the factories.
