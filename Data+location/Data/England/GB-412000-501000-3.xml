		<content>  People come from Germany, Holland,   
 Australia, America as well as Great   
 Britain, to enjoy the Dales and have a
 relaxing time. The River Swale is     
 nearby for fishing or canoeing and    
 there are plenty of footpaths         
 for walkers.                          
  The site is open from March to       
 October, Bank Holidays are very busy  
 times when there can be between 350   
 and 400 people using the site.        
  The owner of the site Mr. and Mrs    
 Carter are kept busy booking people   
 in, cutting the grass, cleaning the   
 toilets, running the shop and sending 
 brochures to people.
