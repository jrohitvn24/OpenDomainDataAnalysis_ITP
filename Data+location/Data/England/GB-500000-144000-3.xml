		<content>   The main determining features are   
 the hills.The houses, roads, canal and
 railway have to run in between them.  
 Most of the building and development  
 is along the A281.                    
   Wonersh is quite small and is       
 centered around a crossroad,whereas   
 Bramley used to be small but is now   
 2km along the road. Blackheath is     
 quite small because it is not built on
 an important road or rail link.It is  
 also quite high up.Even though the    
 canal and railway have been closed,   
 most of the development is still along
 the A281.
