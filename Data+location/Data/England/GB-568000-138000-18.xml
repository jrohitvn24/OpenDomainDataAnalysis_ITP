		<content>The Romany Horse Fair has been held on 
the Village Green for about 200 years. 
Horse dealers &amp; travelling people      
congregate on the Green to buy &amp; sell  
horses &amp; ponies.  Some local people    
have objected to their village green   
being used in this way by those they   
consider outsiders &amp; in 1983 the site  
was changed to a meadow in Paddock     
Wood.                                  
The Lamb Sale.                         
Lambert &amp; Foster auction up to 15000   
lambs at the sale in the Sports Field  
each July.  Buyers come from all parts 
of the country.  In 1984 the best lambs
fetched an average of 45 pounds each.  
The Village Fete.                      
On a Saturday afternoon in June every  
year there is a Fete on the Green.     
Every organisation in the village has a
stall of some kind &amp; the proceeds are  
divided among the organisations.       </content>
