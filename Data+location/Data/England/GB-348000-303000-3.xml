		<title>03LOCAL INDUSTRY-1</title>
		<content> An industrial site exists where 12 or 
 so small businesses employing 2-50    
 staff have been concentrated.Most     
 companies are light engineering.Since 
 1982 these have overcome a general    
 recession and are beginning to refuse 
 work through being understaffed and   
 unable to attract the right kind of   
 work force.                           
 Examples include-{SAND &amp; GRAVEL QUARRY
 This sand and gravel is used for      
 building and filling tips.The quarry  
 has been working 30 years.It is       
 expected to close in another 20       
 years.It is then planned to be        
 landscaped and turned into a boating  
 lake.The site is 25 acres.10 people   
 work there.They work from 7am to      
 5:30pm.The workers are local.700 tons 
 of sand are extracted daily.It costs  
 Â£1000 a day to run the quarry.
