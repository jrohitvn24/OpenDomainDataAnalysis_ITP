		<title>02LANDSCAPE N-W OF HEADCORN</title>
		<content> The land is generally low lying and   
 damp,ranging in height from 18m. near 
 the River Beult to 34m. at Great Tong 
 Farm. The{underlying rock is Wealden  
{Clay}so the land is undulating rather 
 than spectacular although there is one
 small hill just N-W of the main       
 village. There are many ponds in the  
 area,some natural but several man-made
 pits from which clay was once dug and 
 around which willows grow. Flowing    
 from East to West is the R.Beult,a    
 tributary of the Medway. It is only   
 about 15m. wide and meanders very     
 slowly through its flood plain. There 
 are only two remaining{wooded areas}at
 New Barn and at Four Oaks Wood,but the
 area is scattered with many deciduous 
 trees such as Ash,Willow and Field    
 Maple. However,in the main they are   
 Oaks,the remains of the great Wealden 
 forest of Anderida .                  </content>
