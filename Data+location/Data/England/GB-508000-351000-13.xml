		<content>   DORRINGTON CHURCH TALES CONTD.      
     WOOD ELVES IN DORRINGTON.         
   In Dorrington there used to be some 
 oak trees.In each oak tree there lived
 a wood elf.Every night each wood elf  
 would come out and move the church    
 marker stones.Every time a wood elf   
 moved a marker he would lose his      
 magic.He would then go back to his    
 tree and die.The tree would also die  
 with him.Eventually there was just one
 wood elf and one oak tree left.The    
 people who were going to build the    
 church didn't know who kept on moving 
 the markers. They got so fed up with  
 putting them backback that they       
 decided to build the church where the 
 wood elves had moved the markers to.
