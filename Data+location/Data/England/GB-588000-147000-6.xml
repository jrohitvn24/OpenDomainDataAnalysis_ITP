		<title>06The Village School</title>
		<content>   I started school in 1978.  The      
 School is a light and airy new        
 building opened by Lord Cornwallis in 
 1971. It replaced a Victorian School  
 on a different site where now houses  
 have been built.                      
   My impression of school is of a very
 friendly and happy place and I've     
 enjoyed  the seven years I've spent   
 there.  I have known most of the      
 children in my class since Playgroup  
 and some even before.                 
   School starts at 9 am and we usually
 begin with assembly followed by Maths 
 for the Juniors.  Other subjects may  
 include Geography, English, History,  
 Science and Handwriting.              
   Sometimes a mum will come in to     
 school to do things with groups of    
 children; cooking, computer           
 programming, sewing and reading.
