 From the map we found the names of {7 
 farms:-{Temple, Burlow, Manor, Foxlow,
{Hillhead, Heathfield Nook and Staden  
{Grange.}                              
 We found the remains of {Temple Farm} 
 on our field trip. From the walls we  
 could see its size and shape. Probably
 no-one has lived there for 50 years.  
{Burlow Farm} was demolished to make   
 way for houses and {Burlow Garage}is  
 all that remains to remind us of it.  
{Manor Farm}is a small holding now with
 turkeys. None of these 3 places are   
 marked on the latest maps.{           
{Hillhead Farm }is remote but has both 
 sheep &amp; cattle. Mr Slack owns it.     
 Heathfield Nook is a dairy farm but   
 much of the Bennett's land is outside 
 our area. The land of{Staden Grange}is
 now part of{Foxlow Farm.
