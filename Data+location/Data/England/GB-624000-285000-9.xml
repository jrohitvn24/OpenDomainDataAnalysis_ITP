		<content>{           Heating                    
 There is no mains gas supply in the   
 village, so domestic heating and      
 cooking burns alternative fuels. Solid
 fuel,wood and coal are still widely   
 used in open fires in the living room.
 It is also used for biolers and ovens 
 in the kitchens. Electrity, thought by
 many to be clean but expensive is used
 in many kitchens for cooking, some    
 houses also heat the rooms using      
 electic fires or central heating while
 others prefer oil to burn in a central
 heating boiler.                       
 Calor gas is used for                 
 cooking,deliveries are made to the    
 village. This can also be used for    
 central heating - the school is heated
 in this way and many farm use bulk    
 deliveries of calour gas to heat their
 chicken houses.
