		<content> People do a great number of things    
 when not at work.Within the home the  
 usual way of relaxing was to read     
 a book,watch television,watch a film  
 on the video or listen to the         
 radio.Children spend most of their    
 time playing with friends or watching 
 T.V..Adults did grown up things like  
 D.I.Y.,Gardening,Sewing,Knitting.There
 are no sports facilities in the       
 villages but Gartree social club runs 
 Karate classes,Athletics and has a    
 rugby and football pitch where our    
 dads play on a Saturday or Sunday.    
 Although we're not supposed to some of
 us go swimming in the canal if it's   
 hot.
