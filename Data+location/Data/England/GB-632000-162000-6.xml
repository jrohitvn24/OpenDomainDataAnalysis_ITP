		<title>06PICNIC SITE / N.T. RESERVE</title>
		<content> This picnic site doubles up as a N.T. 
 nature reserve.  The reserve was      
 opened on the 30th July 1983.  The    
 site was formally a rubbish tip for   
 Ramsgate.  Unfortunately the reserve  
 does not have a guided tour, but there
 are plenty of well marked footpaths.  
{Number of visitors:} Year 1985/85 was 
 60,000. Cars can park for a small fee.
{Wildlife: Spring-Summer:}Shelduck,    
 Common Tern, Swallow, Reed Bunting,   
 Redshanks, Avocets. {Autumn-Winter:   
 Wigeon, Stonechat, Oystercatchers and 
 the Black-Headed Gull.  30% of the    
 trees have been planted by pupils from
 secondary schools.  Many species of   
 flora in the primary stage of growth  
 can be seen.                          
 There is a part time warden to look   
 after the picnic site and nature      
 reserves which overlooks the saltings 
 of Pegwell Bay and the Stour Estuary  </content>
