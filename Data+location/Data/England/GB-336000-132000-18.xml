		<content> The Post Office at Middlezoy is a     
 small rural sub post office.  It is   
 also the village stores.  The post    
 office and stores is run by Mr and Mrs
 R Gilham who took over in 1984. They  
 sell groceries, fresh fruit and       
 vegetables, provisions, toys, sweets, 
 greetings cards, ice-creams and also  
 have a small off-licence department.  
 The shop is open every day, but is    
 closed on Wednesday afternoons. The   
 post office counter is closed on      
 Saturday afternoons and Sundays.      
 There is one delivery of mail each    
 morning except Sunday. The postman    
 comes from Bridgwater by van. Mail is 
 collected from the letter box by the  
 post office at 8 am and 4.45 pm.      
 Most of the villagers have to travel  
 to Bridgwater or even further afield  
 for other shopping requirements.
