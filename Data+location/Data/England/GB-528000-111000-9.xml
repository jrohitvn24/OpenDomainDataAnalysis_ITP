		<title>09THE JACK AND JILL PUB</title>
		<content> The Jack and Jill pub is on the       
 Burgess Hill to Brighton road at the  
 end of Clayton Tunnel near the Jack   
 and Jill Windmills. It used to be the 
 village store and post office, then   
 called the 'Matsfield Arms' before    
 changing to the 'Jack and Jill'. It   
 has a large well maintained garden    
 with a children's play area and a car 
 park. The landlord has been at this   
 pub for 15 years. Very few of the     
 villagers use the pub so most         
 customers drive there. 7O% of the     
 trade is regular. Many families use   
 the pub in summer because of the      
 garden. There is also a family room   
 inside. Food is sold. The busiest time
 is on Sunday morning. There are 8     
 employees with 4 on at any one time.  
 The landlord complains about the      
 untidy state in which his garden is   
 left. Hundreds of glasses are stolen. </content>
