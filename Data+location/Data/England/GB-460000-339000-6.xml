		<content> AT THE SIDE OF THE RIVER TRENT THERE  
 ARE NETTLES AND WOODS COVERING PARTS  
 OF THE RIVER BANKS.                   
 THE RIVER TRENT IS A LARGE RIVER THAT 
 FLOWS THROUGH THE AREA WE ARE DOING A 
 SURVEY ON.                            
 THE RIVER TRENT IS ABOUT 30 YARDS     
 WIDE.THE RIVER HAS BOTTLES AND RUBBISH
 IN IT WHERE SOME PEOPLE HAVING A      
 PICNIC HAVE THROWN INTO THINGS INTO   
 THE RIVER.                            
 THE RIVER BANKS ARE STEEP AND SLIPPY  
 IN PLACES.                            
 THE VIEW IS NOT VERY GOOD BECAUSE YOU 
 ARE QUITE LOW DOWN.                   
 WHEN YOU REACH COLWICK YOU WILL SEE   
 QUITE A FEW AMENITIES. THERE IS A     
 NATURE TRAIL AND PARK.                
 THERE IS ALSO AN ASSAULT COURSE AND A 
 SWIMMING AREA .                       
 THEY ALSO HAVE BOATING ACTIVITIES.    
 IT IS A NICE PLACE TO WALK AROUND.    </content>
