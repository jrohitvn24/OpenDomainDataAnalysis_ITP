		<title>07Badlesmere: Local Government</title>
		<content> The bulk of the area lies within the  
 boundary of the Sheldwich Badlesmere &amp;
 Leaveland Parish Council.  The N.E.   
 area towards Shepherds Hill is within 
 Selling and the area to the west of   
 Leaveland is within Throwley.  All    
 come under Swale Borough Council.  The
 S.E. corner is within Molash parish,  
 under Ashford Borough Council.        
 The l985 precept for Sheldwich B. &amp; L.
 P.C. was Â£56O, spent as follows :     
 Â£2OO  each to the village halls for   
 maintenance, Â£2O to the 3 churches    
 under the Burial Act and the balance  
 on subscription to the Kent           
 Association of Parish Councils,       
 Audit  Commission, Clerk's fee and    
 hall hire for meetings.               
 Politically the area votes            
 Conservative as would be expected from
 its mainly middle-class population.
