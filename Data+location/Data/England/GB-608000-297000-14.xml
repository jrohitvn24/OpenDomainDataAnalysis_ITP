		<title>14FARMING- PROVIDENCE PLACE</title>
		<content> We visited Providence Place farm.     
 The                                   
 farm is 320 acres in all and is now a 
 mixed farm. 100 acres produce barley, 
 50 acres of wheat, 60 acres of sugar  
 beet and 50 acres for pasture. Maize  
 is also grown for silage. On the farm 
 there are cows, bulls, calves and     
 hundreds of ducks.The ducks are       
 delivered from Kent every Monday at 1 
 day old. They are killed after 8      
 weeks. Each week the ducklings move   
 along a pen as they continue to grow  
 and a new group comes along behind.   
 Everything is kept very clean and     
 warm. The farm house is in two parts, 
 one was built about 1600, the latter  
 in 1876. Two people live there, the   
 farmer and his mother and there are   
 three full time and several part time 
 helpers on the farm.
