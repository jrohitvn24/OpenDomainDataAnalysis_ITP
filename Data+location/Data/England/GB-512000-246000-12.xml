		<content> Arts &amp; Crafts are prominent when fairs
 and bazaars are held, &amp; include{lace- 
{making, sewing, leatherwork, crochet, 
{knitting and soft toys. }A youth group
 makes articles which are sold in aid  
 of the Church at Christmas. {Sheep    
{fleeces}are spun into wool and sold or
 made into garments by{local spinners  
 who also demonstrate their skill.     
{Tapestry work, landscape painting}in  
 oils and watercolours are all enjoyed 
 as hobbies.  Many ladies are competent
{dressmakers,}whilst others form a rota
 to arrange the{Church flowers}weekly, 
 combining their efforts for festivals 
 &amp; competitions.  Excellent{photographs
 of the surrounding area &amp; local people
 are produced to a very high standard &amp;
 gain many prizes at local shows.  More
 diverse crafts are studied at{evening 
{classes}run by the local Education    
 Authority and held in nearby towns.   </content>
