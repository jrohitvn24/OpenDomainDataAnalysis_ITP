		<content>Many mobile shops visit Sywell. The    
freezavan comes around once a month    
with frozen food. Fish and meat vans   
come every Thursday. The library van   
also calls on Thursday mornings for    
people to choose books instead of      
travelling to Northampton. The Midland 
Bank comes Wednesday and parks in the  
pub car park! Three dairies deliver    
milk daily - Coop, Northern Dairies,   
and the local Cogenhoe Dairy.          
Newspapers are delivered daily and     
each house receives a free copy of The 
Post and the Mercury and Herald. There 
is a monthly Church magazine. The Avon 
lady comes monthly selling make-up and 
the Kleeneze lady brings a book to     
choose things like brooms and brushes. 
Children's Welfare comes each month to 
weigh babies. There is no Doctor or    
Dentist Surgery; police, fire, or      
ambulance station in the village.      </content>
