		<title>05Filton Village History</title>
		<content>  Filton was probably a grassy place in
 ancient times.The name is probably    
 derived from two Anglo Saxon words    
 "filede"-hay,and "tun"-a village or   
 farmstead.Little appeared to change   
 over the centuries.In 1814 a rector of
 Filton wrote:-"Horfield is a most     
 lawless place and Filton not much     
 better---Horfield Wood was then on    
 both sides of the road and it was not 
 very safe to pass that way."          
  Perhaps the most important date in   
 Filton's history is 19.2.1910 when Sir
 George White founded Britain's first  
 large scale aeroplane company.Filton's
 bus depot was turned into a factory ;a
 two acre meadow became an airfield.   
  The works were a target for the      
 Luftwaffe in September 1940.More than 
 70 enemy aircraft attacked,killing 72 
 outright and injuring 168 many of whom
 died later.                           </content>
