		<title>19 BETLEY SCHOOL IN THE 1930'S</title>
		<content>   55 years ago Mr.Harold Foster was a 
pupil at our school,when the headmaster
was Mr.Leece,the other teachers were   
Miss Wilson,Miss Riley,Miss Cross and  
Miss Jones.Some days after school Miss 
Jones taught ballroom dancing,all the  
children enjoyed that.The kind of games
the children played were whip and top  
and bowlers which were metal hoops,also
they played cricket and football .In   
the 1930's the classes were large,about
40 in each,now there are about 20.In   
most schools they used pens which you  
had to dip into an ink pot,and some    
children flicked ink around the room,  
which made a big mess.In those days    
children were punished quite often with
the cane.In some schools they had      
dinners but Betley didn't,the children 
had to go home for dinner.Children     
started school at the age of 5 and left
at 14.Now the leaving age is 16.       </content>
