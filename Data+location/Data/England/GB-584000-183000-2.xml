		<title>02A Typical Thursday</title>
		<content> On Thursday I wake up with a yawn, at 
 7 o'clock and wash my face and        
 dress myself in my school uniform. I  
 go downstairs and have breakfast of   
 cornflakes with milk.Then my Mum combs
 my hair and off I go, not to my own   
 school first, but to my sister's to   
 drop her off.If I am early I talk to  
 my friend. When my teacher arrives she
 calls the register and then the bell  
 goes for chapel where the headmistress
 talks about Jesus.After that we have  
 Maths until break when we go out to   
 play.I usually play 'horses' with my  
 friend.After break we do our 'Ginn'   
 until lunch.After lunch a teacher     
 comes in and says Grace.We put our    
 lunchboxes under the table and go to  
 Speech and Drama taken by Mrs. Wells. 
 We work on our projects until         
 home-time.In the evening I go
