		<title>06Changes in Clacton</title>
		<content>     We made a study of the one        
 kilometre square around our school.   
 First we made a study of how many     
 roads were built over a period of     
{fourteen}years, from{1971}to{1985}by  
 using three{ordnance survey maps.}We  
 found out that in{1971}there were only
{twelve}roads in the area, now, in 1985
 there are{sixty nine,}this makes a    
 total of{fifty seven}roads built in   
{fourteen}years, which is an average   
 of about{four}roads a year.           
     The kilometre square has a lot of 
 building going on on both sides of{St.
{Johns Road}which runs through the     
 middle. Probably the best reason for  
 coming to live in Clacton is the      
 quietness of the roads and the main   
 line station to London. Another reason
 is the sea air and the extra{ozone.   
 Clacton is a warm place and there is  
 not much{pollution.                   </content>
