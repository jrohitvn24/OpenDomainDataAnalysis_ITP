		<content> A man in Firle told of a ghost called 
 Mr Gibbons. He is said to have lived  
 in the house at one time.The mans son 
 saw the ghost staring at his electric 
 clock. Then he went out to the landing
 and disappeared. Some time later a man
 came to stay at the house. He saw the 
 ghost staring at the T.V.             
 Another man once went up on the Downs 
 on Christmas Eve with a bottle of hot 
 whisky. At mid-night herd of big white
 horses came out of the hedge and      
 galloped away. Some people that live  
 near them saw the horses as well.     
 There is a saying in the area that the
 Grey Lady is about when a door has    
 been left open and no one has left it 
 open.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
