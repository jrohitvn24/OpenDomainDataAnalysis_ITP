		<title>16MADELEY MANOR</title>
		<content>  Madeley Manor was once a very large  
family house. It was situated a mile or
so South of the village, and was origi-
nally mediaeval. It was fortified in   
1349 to some extent, and had a double  
moat. Although from an engraving dated 
1686 it can be seen to be an impressive
building, today nothing remains except 
for one portion of stonework, and holl-
ows in the ground to mark the position 
of the moats.                          
  On the remaining sandstone stonework 
  it is possible to see the marks of   
 the the stonemason, and also graffiti 
dating from Victorian times.           
  There is documentary evidence that   
the Manor once had a formal walled gar-
den,substantial outbuildings, a stone  
gatehouse,and ornamental fish ponds,   
containing many large carp. Now the    
remains are dark and gloomy,surrounded 
by oak trees and stagnant pools.       </content>
