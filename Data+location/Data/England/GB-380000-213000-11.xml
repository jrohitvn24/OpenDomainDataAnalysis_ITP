		<title>11Elvering on the Severn.</title>
		<content>  Every spring many local people are   
 among the 1000 licenced elver fisher- 
 men who go at night to catch elvers.  
 Using fine mesh nets they catch the   
 young eels as they swim upstream      
 close to the bank.                    
  Between 20 and 75 tonnes of elvers   
 are caught each year. Catches in the  
 last six years have declined. The haul
 in 1985 was 20 tonnes. 1 tonne        
 contains about 3 million elvers. The  
 elvers, having swum the Atlantic, are 
 3 years old and 8cm long when they are
 taken from the river.                 
  The fishermen take some of their     
 catch home. Fried elvers and egg is a 
 renowned local dish. The rest are sold
 to one of the four elvering stations. 
  In 1985 they were paid Â£10_Â£15 per   
 kilo. Many are then exported to       
 America, Europe or even Japan where   
 they are a delicacy.                  </content>
