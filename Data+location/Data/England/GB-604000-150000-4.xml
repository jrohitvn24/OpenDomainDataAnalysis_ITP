		<title>04EVENTS IN GODMERSHAM</title>
		<content> In a small village many of the events 
 are fund raising, the church and      
 village hall are always in need of    
 money.The church recently benefited   
 from a two day event associated with  
 Jane Austen,a frequent visitor to     
 Godmersham. A flower festival was held
 in the newly decorated church.Annual  
 events include the Gardeners Produce  
 show, a carol concert in the village  
 hall and a pre Xmas bazaar with all   
 local organisations taking part.      
 The Gardeners have an annual supper   
 and there is a harvest festival.      
 The church takes part in a Five Church
 Sponsored Walk with four other local  
 churches. Various local people        
 throw open their gardens or hold      
 functions to raise money. Every-one   
 manages to enjoy themselves at the    
 same time.                            
                                       </content>
