		<title>02Event on the river</title>
		<content> On July 7th. there was a raft race    
 from the Market carpark in Frome to   
 Old Ford along the River Frome. I took
 part in the race with my two sisters. 
 My dad built the raft and it took     
 him four weeks. It was made from two  
 chimney stacks filled with polystyrene
 and three oil cans.  We had two       
 practises before the race at different
 times. It was quite hard and the      
 current was strong. There were three  
 weirs to cross.   The last one was    
 very deep and the raft went floating  
 off down the river because we could   
 not hold it back.  It got stuck on a  
 rock and we got it back but we got    
 very wet.   Just before the end,      
 someone threw a bucket of water over  
 us as we went under a bridge.  We came
 third and it was great fun.
