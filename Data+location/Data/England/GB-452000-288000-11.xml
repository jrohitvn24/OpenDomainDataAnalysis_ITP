		<title>11FAMILY LIFE - a weekday</title>
		<content>{Wednesday 24th April 1985}            
 My Sister Sasha, Brother Tim, my Mum, 
 Dad and I, live in a brick house with 
 twelve rooms. We have a big garden    
 where we plant vegetables and flowers.
 I go to bed at 8.30pm, Sasha goes at  
 9.00pm, Tim goes at 7.00pm, and my    
 parents go at 11.00pm. We all get up  
 at 7.00am. My Dad goes to work at     
 8.00am. He is a Quantity Surveyor,    
 making houses, shops and flats. His   
 office is in Wolvey, taking 15 minutes
 by car. Mum takes Tim to playschool   
 and swimming club today. Sasha and I  
 go to school and work hard. After     
 school we have choir practice for a   
 concert at DeMontfort Hall, Leicester,
 and a violin lesson in Hinckley,      
 arriving home at 6.00pm for tea. After
 tea I read and play with Sasha until  
 bedtime.
