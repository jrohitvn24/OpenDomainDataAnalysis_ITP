 Long Bennington. It has a population  
 of 45.{Mr.Staunton}lives in{Staunton  
{Hall.}His family have lived in the    
 village since the eleventh century.   
 They took their name from the village 
 and were called de Staunton. Later    
 they changed their family name to     
 Staunton. The Staunton family built   
 Staunton Hall and the church next to  
 the Hall. Also most of the Staunton   
 family were rectors in that church. It
 is a tradition that the family help to
 defend{Belvoir Castle.}In Staunton    
 there was a walnut tree which was     
 felled in 1923, it was found, by      
 counting the rings, to be 625 years   
 old. During the{Civil War}Oliver      
 Cromwell's men raided Staunton Hall,  
 2 cannonball holes still can be seen  
 in the main door. The contents were   
 sold and the church was ransacked.    </content>
