		<title>13St.MARY'S STREET,CHIPPENHAM.</title>
		<content> Behind{Saint Andrew's Church}on its   
 eastern side lies{Saint Mary's Street.
 It is the oldest street in            
 Chippenham.Many of the houses were    
 built in the 17th century,although one
 house,Wood House,was built in the 16th
 century.                              
 Today{Saint Mary's Street}is a quiet  
 unspoilt street away from the bustle  
 of the town.In the 18th century it was
 called{Cook Street}and it was here in 
 1773 that the first school in         
 Chippenham opened for fifteen poor    
 boys.In the garden of the Old Vicarage
 in 1694 the local Member of Parliament
 for Chippenham,Roger Holland,claimed  
 that the water from the well had      
 medicinal properties and tried to     
 establish Chippenham as a spa town but
 failed.Today the Old Vicarage is the  
 headquarters of the Chippenham Society
 of the Arts.                          </content>
