		<title>02ROSSINGTON  PIT</title>
		<content>     Rossington grew rapidly in size   
 when the pit was sunk in 1912 and many
 new jobs were created.                
     Coal was first produced in 1915.  
 Today five coal faces produce 18,000  
 tons weekly, mainly for the Yorkshire 
 Power Stations.  The pit employs 1725 
 people including management staff.    
     Two Rossington miners describe    
 where they work - "Rossington Pit has 
 two shafts.  Number 1 shaft takes in  
 fresh air and also has two lifts which
 have 3 decks, each deck carries 27 men
 up or down.  The shaft is also used   
 for carrying equipment in and out ,and
 carries electric and telephone        
 cables, water and air pipes and air   
 monitoring tubes.                     
     Number 2 or Return Air shaft has  
 two lifts or skips which can carry 10 
 tons of coal or men in an emergency".
