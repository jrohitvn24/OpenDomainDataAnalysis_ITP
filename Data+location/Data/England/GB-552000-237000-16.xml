 Saffron Walden is said to have more   
 clubs and societies per head of       
 poulation than any other town in      
 England. This may or may not be true  
 but there are a lot. From the         
 political parties to allotment        
 societies to Welsh societies, the     
 churches, hobbies, everything seems   
 catered for.                          
 In a small town some events involve   
 most of the town. Every three years   
 there is a carnival with floats from  
 all the organisations, businesses and 
 schools. Each year there is an open   
 air play in the museum grounds by the 
 castle which is packed out and the    
 High School Farm Club Dance is a major
 social event.
