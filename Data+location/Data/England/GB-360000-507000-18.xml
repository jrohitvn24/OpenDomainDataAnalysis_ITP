		<title>18ORTON - 50 YEARS AGO</title>
		<content>  Orton 50 years ago was quite         
 different from what it is now.There   
 were six shops which sold sweets and  
 groceries.In those days people rode   
 bicycles but few people had cars.Orton
 did not have any holiday cottages and 
 the Market Hall was used as a Dance   
 Hall.The vicar for Orton was Canon    
 King and the school head master was Mr
 Beal.There were about 300 people      
 living in Orton then.Those who had    
 holidays went to Morecambe.There were 
 two pubs_The Duke of Cumberland and   
 the George Hotel.Peoples jobs were    
 joiners, blacksmiths, cobblers,       
 farmers  and iron mongers.Buses ran   
 to Kendal and Penrith.There were two  
 doctors_Dr Graham and Dr Gibson.About 
 the mid-1930's the local "Pot Fair",  
 held at Whitsuntide, and the "Tup     
 Fair",held on 21st October on the     
 School Green, both came to an end.    </content>
