Although the area of this block is near
the County Town of Stafford and Newport
and  is  near motorway links  to  large
conurbations, it is remarkable  for its
lack of urban and residential  develop-
ment in general. The survey  revealed a
dearth  of  amenities  as the  area  is
almost entirely made up of farmland.   
No  large village is  contained  within
the  area, although part of  Ranton  is
included  in  the north of  the  block.
Although there are few amenities and no
focal  centre,  community  life  seemed
strong   with  most  farming   families
knowing each other well.
