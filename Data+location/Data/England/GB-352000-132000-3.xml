		<title>03FARMING</title>
		<content>    There are 18 farms within our area,
 concentrating largely on milk         
 production.The milk is then sold to   
 one of the large commercial dairies   
 but one farmer in Baltonsborough      
 bottles and delivers his own milk.Beef
 cattle are also reared. There is very 
 little crop growing apart from silage 
 and hay. There is one farmer with a   
 flock of sheep for commercial purposes
 and one with a flock of Jacob sheep,  
 kept for their wool for spinning.     
    We visited two apple orchards, the 
 larger of which is five acres and     
 contains the older type of standard   
 apple trees. In the smaller orchard   
 grow newer bush apple trees.The apples
 are used by a Taunton cider company. A
 year's harvest yields 20 tonnes. Using
 apples from smaller growers, the owner
 makes his own cider with traditional  
 methods and press.                    </content>
