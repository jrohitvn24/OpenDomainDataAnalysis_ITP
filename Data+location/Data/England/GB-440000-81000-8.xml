		<title>08THE SPAR SHOP,BRIGHSTONE</title>
		<content>  The Spar shop is a focal point of the
 village. As well as selling important 
 supplies (mainly food) for locals and 
 tourists alike, it also provides a    
 place to gather and natter!           
  The busiest times for the lady who   
 runs the shop are Christmas and the   
 summer.Throughout the year she opens  
 from Monday to Saturday from 7.30am to
 6.00pm with an hour closed for lunch. 
 She has five helpers, some of whom are
 part_time. Many of her customers use  
 the shop as an unofficial bank as     
 there is none in Brighstone and the   
 Post Office is often busy.            
  The shop is situated in a central    
 position in the village right opposite
 the tea gardens which means that the  
 coach loads of visitors often shop    
 here.When asked if it seemed quiet in 
 winter the owner replied that that was
 when the locals came out!             </content>
