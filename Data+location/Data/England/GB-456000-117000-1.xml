		<content> This area is predominately            
 agricultural with many acres of       
 rolling countryside.   Autumn sown    
 wheat and barley, few fields fallow.  
 Many hedges and small deciduous       
 copses.   The pastures are maintained 
 for beef and cattle, mainly Herefords,
 black with white faces; not many dairy
 herds, Fresian and some flocks of     
 sheep, Suffolk Cross, large white     
 lowland breeds.  Fields are kept for  
 hay cuttings and recently silage has  
 become very popular, stored in sound  
 bales in polythene sacks.  Some homes 
 have a few sheep grazing in an orchard
 and a number of hens, ducks and or    
 geese.   The outskirts of a country   
 town has council owned properties and 
 residential houses, in the country the
 houses are larger than town workers   
 cottages.   The main employment is    
 farming related with Portsmouth,      </content>
