		<title>07SPORTS IN STOCKLAND</title>
		<content> After our questionnaire survey we     
 discovered that sport was the most    
 popular way to spend leisure time,as  
 forty five people were involved in    
 sporting clubs. Stockland Tennis Club 
 is most popular and holds regular     
 tournaments. We are members of this   
 club, and play once a week. Next to   
 the village hall is the pitch of the  
 Stockland Cricket  Club, which is     
 keenly supported.Some other sports    
 clubs include badminton,rifle shooting
 hunting,swimming and skittles.        
 Our parents play skittles, where they 
 have three wooden balls, and try to   
 knock down wooden skittles at the end 
 of an alley.A {flopper}is where you   
 knock all the skittles down in one    
 ball;a{spare}uses two balls; a{duck}  
 means you miss  all the skittles.
