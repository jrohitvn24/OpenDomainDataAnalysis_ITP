		<title>08DEVIZES FAIR.</title>
		<content> Devizes Fair comes to the town three  
 times a year and is situated on the   
 Green and sometimes near the Crammer. 
 We have 'Jennings' Fair living quite  
 close to us but most of the year it is
 travelling around the country.        
 The Fair comes usually for the first  
 two months in the year and at Carnival
 time,when it is near the Crammer      
 because the Carnival is on the Green. 
 It also comes home to Devizes for the 
 winter.                               
 There are lots of rides including     
 the 'Super Trouper','Invader'and the  
 'Meteor'.There are also less scarey   
 ones like the 'Ladybirds','Helter     
 Skelter'and the 'Roundabouts'. Most   
 of the rides are 30p but some are 50p.
 There is always an exciting atmosphere
 at the Fair, and the smell of hot dogs
 and candyfloss abounds.
