		<content>  The raw, unsreened effluent from the 
 town of Camborne is discharged into   
 the sea some 300 yards from the base  
 of the cliffs.  Rough seas quickly    
 break down the solid materials, but in
 periods of calm, faecal material and  
 other solids are to be found in coves 
 and on beaches in the area.  In one   
 instance, harmful bacteria was found  
 to be thriving on the shoreline four  
 days after being deposited there by a 
 storm.  Mine waste also affects the   
 valley bottom of the Red River at     
 Camborne Coombe, where centuries of   
 deposition of sand from mining        
 operations have left the soil         
 contaminated with toxic substances.   
 Weathering has leached this out of the
 top 6" (15 cm) but little will grow   
 below this depth.
