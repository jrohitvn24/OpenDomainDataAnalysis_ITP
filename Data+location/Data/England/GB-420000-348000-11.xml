		<title>11ATLOW MUSHROOM FARM</title>
		<content> There is a mushroom farm in Atlow.It  
 has been a mushroom farm for 12 years.
 Before that it was a poultry farm.    
 The mushrooms are are grown in nine   
 large sheds.They are grown in compost 
 made from horse dung.They use 20 tons 
 of horse dung per week and that makes 
 1000 bags of compost.I is dark and    
 humid in the growing sheds.The compost
 is changed every 12 weeks.The old     
 compost is sold to gardeners at 35p   
 per bag. It takes the mushrooms about 
 13 days to grow.When they are ready   
 they are like buttons and very white  
 in colour.                            
 The farm produces about two or three  
 thousand baskets of mushrooms per     
 week (about 3 tons).                  
 To help the farmer 3 full time workers
 and 13 part-time workers are employed.
