		<title>13PRIORSLEE HALL</title>
		<content>  Priorslee was named Priorslee because
 it was part of the land belonging to  
 the priory at Wombridge. Priorslee    
 Hall was built of red brick in the    
 18th century by Edward Jorden. Dutch  
 style dormer windows were added in the
 mid-nineteenth century. In 1802 John  
 Bishton, an owner of the Hall, helped 
 found the Lilleshall Company. From    
 1817 the Hall was the head office of  
 the company. During the Chartist riots
 in 1842 soldiers hid in the cellars in
 case they were needed to deal with    
 local miners.                         
  Telford Development Corporation took 
 over the Hall in 1964 and will be     
 leaving there about the end of 1990.  
 400 people worked there when they were
 busiest, but 300 people work there now
 because jobs are being phased out.    
 When T.D.C. leave the Hall it will be 
 used for business purposes.           </content>
