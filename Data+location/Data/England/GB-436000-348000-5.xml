		<title>05HOUSING IN RIPLEY</title>
		<content> In Ripley there are two main types of 
 housing, the privately owned houses   
 and the houses that the council       
 owns,and which people rent from the   
 council.The council houses were built 
 about 1959 when not many people had   
 cars so practically no council house  
 has a garage.Most of the council      
 houses have chimneys because a lot of 
 people used coal then.The newer houses
 were built in 1973 and are a bit      
 different.Most of the newer houses    
 have garages and a lot of them have   
 gas or electric fires and no          
 chimneys,and are a bit bigger than the
 council houses.
