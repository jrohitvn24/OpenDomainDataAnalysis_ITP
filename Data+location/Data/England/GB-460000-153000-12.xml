		<content> Hampshire County Council is the       
 Highway Authority. All the roads in   
 Sherborne St. John are local roads    
 except the A340 Basingstoke to Tadley 
 road which is a County Primary road.  
 The regular bus service from          
 Basingstoke to Tadley travels on this 
 road.There is a route reserved on the 
 local Plan for a by-pass which will   
 take the A340 west of Sherborne st.   
 John to join the Basingstoke Ring Road
 system. The Ring Road was built at the
 time that Basingstoke expanded.  There
 is a space for a dual carriageway     
 thoughout its length, although to     
 date, single carriageway exists in    
 places. Estate roads are planned to   
 run mainly on the outskirts of the    
 housing into garage areas, leaving    
 safe pedestrian walkways.
