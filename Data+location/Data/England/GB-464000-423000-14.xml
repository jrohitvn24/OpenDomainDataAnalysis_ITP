		<title>14History of Carlton Towers</title>
		<content> The Carlton Estate has been passed    
 down entirely by inheritance since the
 Norman Conquest.In 1O86 it was held by
 Robert de Brus.                       
 In 1301 it was inherited by Nicolas   
 Stapleton and wife Sibyl de Bellow.His
 son Miles had two sons,Nicholas who   
 inherited Carlton,and Gilbert.He had  
 two sons,Sir Miles and Brian,who      
 inherited the crest.From him Carlton  
 passed to Brian,his grandson,who      
 married Joan,neice and co-heiress of  
 the last Viscount Beaumont.In 1476    
 they were the first of the family to  
 live there.This made the Stapletons   
 heirs to the Barony of Beaumont.The   
 Beaumonts live there to this date.    
 The present owner is the Duke of      
 Norfolk,who inherited it from his     
 mother,the last Baroness Beaumont,who 
 is buried in the local cemetery.
