		<title>03WALTON HURST - MIXED FARMING</title>
		<content>                                       
 Walton Hurst is the largest farm on   
 the estate belonging to Lord          
 Lichfield.  The present tenant took   
 over from his father in 1973.  His    
 son, likewise, will inherit the       
 tenancy.                              
 The farm comprises 396 acres divided  
 into 15 fields.  This year there are  
 126 acres of wheat, 54 winter barley, 
 12 spring barley, 12 peas (which have 
 failed).  The rest is for silage.  A  
 herdsman, tractor driver, a relief    
 herdsman/stockman and the herdsman's  
 wife work for the farmer.             
 There is an average of 120 Friesian   
 cattle, of which 60 are in milk and   
 the rest are calving.  Currently there
 are 30 in-calf heifers and 39 year-   
 old heifers.  All bull calves are     
 sold. Cattle are sent to market every 
 week.                                 </content>
