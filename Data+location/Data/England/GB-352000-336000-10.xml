 pigs.It is quite difficult to run a   
 pig farm and Mr.Dickenson has always  
 bred pigs.When the piglets are born   
 they weigh about 2 pounds.Mr.Dickenson
 does not buy them as piglets.The pigs 
 eat a mixture of barley,wheat,beans   
 and peas made into small pellets.He   
 has had this lot for 4 to 5 weeks.The 
 price  of a pig would be around Â£30.A 
 sow has 25 piglets a year.There are 12
 different breeds of pig in England.He 
 keeps the pigs for appx 13 weeks he   
 loses about  1\% through sickness.
