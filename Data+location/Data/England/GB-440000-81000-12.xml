		<content>  A main road runs parallel to the     
 coast called the Military Road.Beyond 
 this the low, flat_topped cliffs      
 stretch towards the sea. They are only
 10 to 15 metres high. The cliffs are  
 made of sand and clay. The clay is    
 greyish_blue in colour and called     
 blue slipper clay. The particles of   
 clay are so small that water cannot   
 penetrate easily. This means that     
 anything above the clay can slip off  
 the greasy wet layer of clay and cliff
 falls are common in this region. The  
 holiday camp has lost half of its land
 in 40 years.Although this is not real 
 potter's clay you can have fun        
 moulding it and making pots. They     
 crack as the clay dries though.       
  The beach here is narow and nearly   
 covered at high tide. It is made up of
 sand and pebbles and is not suitable  
 for bathers.                          </content>
