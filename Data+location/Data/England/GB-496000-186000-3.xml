		<title>03QUAKER HOUSE  *  HEDGERLEY</title>
		<content>     Quaker House was three old        
cottages built in the Tudor Period. A  
Quaker bought it, did it up and sold it
again in 1957.                         
     It was called the Quaker House    
because Quakers used to have meetings  
there which started in 1662. It had a  
central fire and there was a smoke hole
in the ceiling because chimneys did not
exist then. It was a prosperous        
farmhouse. The top floor of the house  
was used for sleeping and storage.     
    The first occupants were sheep     
owners, it was the Elizabethan Period  
and wool was needed.                   
     Later, when the chimney was       
installed it was put in the wall of two
rooms so they could both be heated.    
     There is no true documentry       
evidence of the house. In 1656 a man   
wrote the history of the Quakers.
