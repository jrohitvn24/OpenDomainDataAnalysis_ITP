		<title>10LEISURE PURSUITS</title>
		<content> BEING SITUATED MORE OR LESS HALFWAY   
 BETWEEN NORWICH AND GREAT YARMOUTH,   
 THERE MAY AT FIRST SIGHT SEEM LITTLE  
 NEED FOR THE COMMUNITY TO ORGANISE    
 ITS OWN LEISURE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN  
 THE VILLAGE.BUT THIS POINT OF VIEW    
 NEGLECTS THE CONTRIBUTION THAT CLUBS  
 AND SOCIETIES CAN MAKE TO COMMUNITY   
 SPIRIT.POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MAIN       
 REASONS WHY ACLE IS SUCH A HAPPY PLACE
 TO LIVE AND WORK IS THAT THE VILLAGERS
 OFTEN MEET EACH OTHER SOCIALLY.SOME OF
 THE ACTIVITIES AVAILABLE INCLUDE:W.I, 
 FRIDAY CLUB,CRICKET AND FOOTBALL TEAMS
 BADMINTON,BELL RINGING,BIRDING CLUBS, 
 ANGLING SOCIETY,ACLE SOCIETY,CUBS ETC 
 FOOTPATH SOCIETY,NORFOLK NATURALISTS  
 TO NAME JUST A FEW.THROUGH MEMBERSHIP 
 OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE,NEWCOMERS ARE 
 USUALLY QUICKLY ABSORBED INTO THE     
 COMMUNITY.
