		<content>      Cardington is  3 miles south_east
 of Bedford.  It has  a  population  of
 260. Most  of  them are elderly, there
 are  very  few  families  with   young
 children. The large green hangars loom
 over the village.  In St Mary's church
 there is a memorial to the victim's of
 the R1O1 disaster.                    
                                       
      In the middle of the village is a
 green where the people met. They would
 have the  fete  or  meetings.   Around
 the   green  are  the  church, the old
 school,  the  pub,  a  few old houses,
 Home Farm and the village hall.       
                                       
       There are no shops in Cardington
 only a small post office. For shopping
 and  work  the  villages  must  go  to
 Bedford or other towns. The old school
 is now the home of the Rural Community
 Council.                              </content>
