		<content>{A SPECIFIC FARM.}                     
 During the past few years trees have  
 been planted both evergreen and       
 deciduous in small corners of fields  
 and where older trees have fallen or  
 died. The greatest asset on the farm  
 is the hedgegrowth we have managed to 
 re- establish. These hedges are of the
 box shape and about 2.2 metres high   
 and 1.5 metres wide with grass banks  
 which give ample scope for smaller    
 animals and insects. Old watering     
 holes have been kept and bushes and   
 trees planted, where possible - such  
 as willows. Chemical spraying is kept 
 to a minimum and none whatsoever used 
 on the headlands of the fields so as  
 to give an even larger area for       
 insects, small birds and animals to   
 live and compete with each other in   
 their own environment.
