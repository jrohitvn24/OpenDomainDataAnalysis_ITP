		<title>08Housing Survey of Stoke Hill</title>
		<content>  Stoke Hill Middle School did a       
 housing survey of square 9394. This is
 the square that our school is in and  
 the survey showed there is quite a    
 mixture of types of housing. {        
{Detached houses}=138                  
{Semi-detached houses}=216             
{Terraced houses}=403                  
{Bungalows}=20                         
{Flats}=168           {Total}=945      
  The area which we have surveyed      
 consists almost entirely of property  
 built within the last 50 years.About  
 one quarter of the total was          
 originally built by the council for   
 renting, but a proportion of this is  
 now owner-occupied.About 10% of the   
 homes are rented from a private       
 property company.The remainder have   
 been built for sale.These have been   
 erected during the past three years   
 and building is still taking place.   </content>
