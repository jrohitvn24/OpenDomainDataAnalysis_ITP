		<title>06RELIGION IN GODMERSHAM</title>
		<content> The only place of worship is          
 Godmersham Parish Church. This parish 
 is typical of rural Anglicanism: no   
 resident incumbent (Godmersham shares 
 a priest with Crundale,               
 Hastingleigh,Elmsted); few regular    
 worshippers (15 to 20 most Sundays at 
 11.00 with 30 on the electoral role), 
 but a wide village involvement at     
 festivals and in fund-raising for the 
 fabric (the church has been completely
 redecorated this year).               
 Church weddings are popular (6 in     
 1985), Although most Godmersham babies
 are baptised and 14 children aged 3 to
 13 attend Sunday School few of their  
 parents are regular worshippers. Among
 those who do worship are both Catholic
 and Methodist denominations as well as
 the regular Anglican population.
