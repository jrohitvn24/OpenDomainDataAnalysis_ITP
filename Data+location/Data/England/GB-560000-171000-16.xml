		<content> Barnfield Pit is world famous as the  
 site in which the oldest human remains
 in Europe were found in 1935.The      
 skull,which was in three pieces, is   
 probably a woman's skull over 250,000 
 years old.                            
 In 1985 50th anniversary celebrations 
 were held and several thousand people 
 saw Magnus Magnusson unveil three     
 plaques to commemorate the discovery. 
 Barnfield Pit is a dis-used gravel pit
 that was formerly owned by Blue Circle
 until 1954 when it was given to the   
 Nature Conservancy Council. The pit   
 became a rubbish dump and a play area 
 for local children - it has now been  
 cleared and transformed into a nature 
 reserve.                              
 On July 1st 1985 hundreds of local    
 school children were taken to see this
 historic site of anthropological and  
 archaeological importance.            </content>
