 Travel to and from Newhaven is by both
 road and rail.  Southdown is the local
 company which operates the bus        
 service.  This includes "Stage Coach" 
 which is a service along the coast and
 "County Rider" which only caters for a
 maximum of thirty passengers and      
 offers wheelchair facilities, serving 
 the surrounding villages linking both 
 Newhaven and Lewes.  There are three  
 railway stations in Newhaven.  The    
 Town station serves the general       
 public: the Harbour station is mainly 
 used by ferry passengers while the    
 third station is used for cargo.  The 
 British Rail service  links Newhaven  
 with Seaford, Brighton and Lewes where
 passengers change for forward travel  
 to London, the journey taking one hour
 fifteen minutes.
