		<title>09TRANSPORT IN AREA</title>
		<content> Transport in the area is very much the
 responsibility of the individual. An  
 area which years ago saw people moving
 almost exclusively by foot or horse   
 now sees everyone moving by motor car.
 The only daily public transports are  
 school buses to take children to      
 Flyford School outside the area to the
 Middle School and High School at      
 Pershore.  A bus for Alcester goes    
 through Abberton weekly whilst there  
 is a daily return bus from Flyford to 
 Worcester.  All of this transport is  
 run by private contractors.  Almost   
 complete lack of public transport     
 facility again explains the reluctance
 of younger families to move into the  
 area.  At least one car per family is 
 essential for taking part in any      
 social activites especially concerning
 children.  Exhaustion of fossil fuels 
 could be a problem later.             </content>
