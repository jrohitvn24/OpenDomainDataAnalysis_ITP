 that are  needed in the village.They  
 look after things like the playing    
 field and they inspect the plans for  
 new houses.This year they are going to
 provide rubbish bins and seats on the 
 village green,a hard standing outside 
 the school and help with tree         
 planting.They give donations to cubs
