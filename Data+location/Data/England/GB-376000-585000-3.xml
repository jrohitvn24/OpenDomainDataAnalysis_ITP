		<content> Potatoes and turnips are sold locally 
 by the farmers who grow them.         
 Pasteurised milk can be bought 3 times
 a week when it is brought from the    
 dairy at Hexham. Otherwise people use 
 UHT or dried milk which they can buy  
 at the post office at Lanehead or in  
 the shops at Bellingham. A few people 
 use untreated milk from their own     
 cows. A few people have their own hens
 or bantams and produce their own eggs.
 Otherwise we buy them at Bellingham,  
 or the post office. A baker and       
 greengrocer's van travels to most of  
 the area once or twice a week. He     
 sells bread, cakes, fruit and         
 vegetables and most groceries. The    
 drivers make friends with the dogs on 
 their route by feeding them stale     
 buns.
