		<title>04ST. PETERS CHURCH LINKENHOLT</title>
		<content> Linkenholt church is united under one 
 Vicar with Faccombe, Hurstbourne      
 Tarrant and Vernham Dean.             
 In October 1985 the Vicar will be     
 leaving; a Parson from Chilbolton     
 is to take the services until a new   
 Vicar is appointed. In 1871 the       
 present church was built, moved from a
 site behind the Manor. The old        
 graveyard is now within the Manor     
 gardens. A Norman Font and South Door 
 was moved from the old church. Repairs
 in 1985 to the Bell Turret have cost  
 about Â£2500. Estimates have been      
 accepted for repairs to the outside   
 walls and the Porch. Money for repairs
 comes from the Executor of the late   
 H.C.Blagrave, collections at services,
 covenants and a Sale in June. A new   
 organ, curtains and Bell repairs given
 by parishoners. The Graveyard is well 
 kept with recent tombstones.          </content>
