		<content>  After the bell had rung for break I  
 got a netball out of the cupboard     
 because I've got to get my shooting   
 ready for the netball tournament on   
 Saturday. Lisa Gray shot with me.     
 (10.45)                               
 When I came in from break there were  
 some visitors coming to look around   
 our classroom. I worked on my Bayeux  
 tapestry and then I wrote this diary  
 (There has been a village school in   
{Eye}for 130 years but it got too      
 small. The Victorian infant and junior
 schools still exist, they are near the
{church of St Matthew ,EYE}).          
{Work completed by the children of:    
{Eye Church of England Primary,        
{Walton County Primary and             
{Dogsthorpe County Junior.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
