		<content> Len Boulton, although moving five     
 times, has always stayed in Apperley. 
 The Boultons are one of the oldest    
 families to live in Apperley and a    
 family tree has evolved around the    
 area. Five families live along the    
 same row of houses in Severn Way.     
 Boultons tend to look alike!  Louise  
 Boulton's grandfather came to live in 
 Apperley after World War I when his   
 father was killed so that he and 6    
 other children could be brought up    
 with family support.  Boulton men     
 continued to serve in the forces in   
 World War II. Initially most men were 
 engaged in farming as labourers but   
 now the two fathers of school         
 pupils have found work                
 externally - Louise's at{Smiths       
{Industries,}Bishop's Cleeve and       
 Susan's at{Dowtys }in Cheltenham.
