		<title>01        THE KNOLL</title>
		<content>{The Knoll}is the highest place in our 
 area. It dates back to the{Ice Age}   
 when a{glacier}melted and left        
 everything that it had pushed in front
 of it in the shape of a hill. The word
 Knoll means a small rounded hill or   
 mound. On the day we climbed it the   
 weather was dull and overcast but you 
 could still see all of our area for   
 the{Domesday Project.}It was very     
 windy,just the place to fly a kite,and
 we were puffed out when we got to the 
 top. From the top you could see       
 through{360 degrees.}The main sight   
 were lots of fields, some were being  
 silaged by the farmers and later some 
 will be used for hay. There were only 
 a few sheep and cows that we could see
 that day. We could see the road       
 running through the middle of our     
 area, the road goes from{Leominster}to
{Ludlow.}                              </content>
