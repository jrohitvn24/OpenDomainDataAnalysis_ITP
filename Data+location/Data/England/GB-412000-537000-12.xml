		<title>12TOW LAW, CO. DURHAM</title>
		<content>  On the outskirts of Tow Law there is 
 an estate of small factories which    
 have been built to attract firms      
 into the area as many people are      
 unemployed. At the moment,however,few 
 of the factories are in use. Nearby   
 there is a small engineering firm     
 making castings but the main employers
 are the surrounding farms.            
{ Tow Law has shops,pubs,cafes,and an  
{hotel. There are two primary schools; 
{the County school and a R.C. Aided    
{school.There are 3 churches; R.C.,    
{Methodist and Church of England.      
  The only bank is quite busy when the 
 fortnightly cattle mart sale is on.   
{ Just recently a B.M.X. track has been
{built on a piece of waste land and it 
{is hoped that a new Community Centre  
{will soon be built to replace the one 
{which had to be demolished early in   
{1985.                                 </content>
