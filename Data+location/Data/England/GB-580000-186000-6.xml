		<title>06The West Wood.</title>
		<content>   This wood of 33 hectares is owned by
 the Church of England but it is       
 managed by Castle Point District      
 Council as an{open space}.The wood's  
 voluntary warden has recently         
 succeeded in having it designated as a
{nature reserve}.                      
   The wood is not being coppiced but  
 nesting sites are being created by    
 providing nesting-boxes and by closing
 paths to reduce disturbance. This     
 year, 1985, the warden hopes to build 
 a pond as a fire-fighting measure.    
   While the numbers of{jay, green     
{woodpecker and magpie}remain steady,  
 few smaller birds nest because of     
 excesive disturbance. There are       
 several{fox-holes}and a{badger        
 community but only{rabbits}and{grey   
{squirrels}are on the increase.
