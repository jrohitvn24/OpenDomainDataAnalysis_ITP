      J.A.C CLUB started  ten years ago
 in 1975. It  is  held  every  Friday -
 around 35 to 45 children go  each week
 and it costs 20 pence to get in. Every
 week there  is  something different to
 do. One week we could  have  games and
 another  week there  could be a disco.
 J.A.C CLUB can brighten you  up if you
 are bored. There are  refreshments and
 a lady called  Jill serves the sweets.
 It  starts  at  5.45  and  finishes at
 7.15. Sometimes we go on visits to the
 Ice Bowl. Some  other things  we do at
 J.A.C   CLUB  are   sweet  making  and
 activities,  which  include  Rounders,
 Football,  Keep  Fit  and  Gymnastics.
 There  were  not  many  things for the
 boys  to  do  so  a  snooker table was
 bought  for  them  to  use and a table
 tennis table as well.                 </content>
