		<title>19ST.STEPHEN'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> St.Stephen-on-the-Cliffs is a large,  
 cross-shaped church on the north shore
 of Blackpool.                         
 As you walk through the door,it looks 
 very much like any other church, with 
 the visitors' book and the posters in 
 the porch, and the aisle leading to   
 the high altar and the choir stalls;  
 however, to the right of the altar    
 there is an actors' chapel, the only  
 one in the world. It is in remembrance
 of all actors, and on the right of the
 altar in this chapel is a plaque with 
 a list of names.                      
   The church contains two other       
 chapels, -the Lady Chapel,            
 which is sometimes used for communions
 or for confessions, and the Chapel of 
 All Souls, where the ashes of dead    
 people are kept; their names are also 
 shown on a plaque.                    
                                       </content>
