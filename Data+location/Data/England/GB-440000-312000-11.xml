		<title>11People Of Coalville:</title>
		<content>{Alan Sanderson:}                      
{              }Alan can remember when{
{Broadway Shopping Centre}was just     
 fields used for fairs. There were a   
 lot of small shops along High Street, 
 where you could buy four things for a 
 penny. Lots more houses have been     
 built on Jackson Street, where        
 previously there were fields. Alan    
 used to go to{The Grand}which was a   
 dance hall, but is now a discotheque  
 called{Phaze 111.}He would like to see
 more cinemas in Coalville.            
          If there was a major disaster
 in Coalville Alan thinks the people   
 would help in any way they could, as  
 it is a generally helpful community.  
 There has only ever been one disaster 
 in Coalville, that was{Whitwick Mines 
{Disaster}when everyone rallied round  
 and helped.
