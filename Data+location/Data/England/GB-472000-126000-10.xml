		<content> "Daylight" dawns at 4.00 am when the  
 lights are switched on, and "night"   
 falls at 8.00 pm.The noise level is   
 high. The eggs are collected on a     
 belt,and conveyed to the packing shed.
 Dirty or bloodied eggs are detected by
 a light sensitive cell, and are       
 returned to the washer. The packing   
 shed processes up to 20,000 eggs per  
 hour.The breed of hen used most often 
 in this plant is the 1SA Warren. The  
 hens generate large quantities of     
 dung, which falls to the bottom of the
 sheds.It makes very good garden       
 manure.Rigid sterilisation regulations
 are enforced within the plant.The eggs
 are stored in a controlled environment
 where the temperature and humidity    
 remain constant throughout the year.1 
 manager and 7 staff run the farm and  
 help to supply the nation with the 280
 eggs per head per year that we eat.   </content>
