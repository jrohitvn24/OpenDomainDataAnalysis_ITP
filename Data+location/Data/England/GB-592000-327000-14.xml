		<title>14Children's Clothes</title>
		<content> We have school clothes, play clothes  
 and going out clothes. Our school     
 uniform is green. Boys' winter wear is
 grey tousers or shorts, white shirt or
 thin polo-necked top, green sweater   
 and optional green and white striped  
 tie. Their summer wear is the same    
 except that they can wear a T-shirt   
 (preferably white or green). Girls'   
 winter wear is a grey skirt or        
 pinafore dress and the same as the    
 boys on their top half. Their summer  
 wear is a green and white checked     
 dress and green cardigan. Uniform     
 isn't compulsory but is preferred. We 
 mostly wear denim jeans with a T-shirt
 or sweater for play. Trainers are good
 as play shoes. For best, girls like   
 pretty dresses or dungarees, and the  
 boys have smart trousers and sweaters.
 We sleep in pyjamas or nightdresses   
 and have shorts and T-shirts for P.E. </content>
