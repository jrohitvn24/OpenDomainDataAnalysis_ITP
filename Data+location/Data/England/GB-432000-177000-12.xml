		<title>12Mr.Roberts-The beef farmer.</title>
		<content> On Mr.Roberts'farm there are a hundred
 stores and twelve Highland cattle,some
 sheep and lambs.He has been living at 
 Limes Farm for twelve years and enjoys
 his job.He has Hereford cross         
 Friesian cows,mules,Masham sheep and  
 some rams which are mostly            
 Suffolk.Mr.Roberts'job consists of    
 looking after all the animals and     
 making sure they are all well.He keeps
 the cattle for about eighteen months  
 and then takes them to the butchers.It
 takes him about three hours to feed   
 the animals in the winter and ten     
 minutes in the summer.It takes about  
 three minutes to shear a sheep,but he 
 is not concerned with that,although he
 has been a shepherd for 23 years.The  
 cattle are fed on silage in the       
 winter,also rolled barley.Of all the  
 animals on the farm,Mr.Roberts prefers
 the cattle.                           </content>
