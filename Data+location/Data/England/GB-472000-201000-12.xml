		<title>12Population Change:Chinnor et</title>
		<content>   Chinnor has experienced tremendous  
 growth in the last 20 years and now   
 has a population of some 6,000. Two   
 new primary schools were built to     
 accomodate all the young children.    
 Population: 1961-1,500; 1971-4,500;   
 1984-6,000                            
   In contrast, Sydenham and Emmington 
 remained fairly stable during this    
 time. Several Sydenham families in    
 1843 were given financial assistance  
 to emigrate to Australia to alleviate 
 problems of poverty and unemployment  
 in an area wholly dependent on        
 agriculture. Population then was 437; 
 later this dropped to 392. In 1971,   
 there were 305 people; in 1981, 339.  
   Emmington families also emigrated to
 Australia and for the same reason-    
 agricultural depression.              
 Population: 1851-104; 1861-88;        
 1950-46; 1985-55 approx.              </content>
