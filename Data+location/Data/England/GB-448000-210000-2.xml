		<content>  Six very important roads cut through 
 our area:the A34,A43,A423,A40,and     
 Sunderland Avenue.Four of these roads 
 are trunk-roads.Together with         
 motorways, trunk-roads are the major  
 roads in the country.                 
  In order to build the roads the      
 existing farmland was bought by the   
 council.Where the roads cut through   
 large fields, bridges were built to   
 enable animals and machinery to be    
 moved.The trunk-roads carry  a very   
 heavy volume of traffic as does the   
 Peartree Roundabout where the A34 and 
 the A43 meet. It is the busiest       
 roundabout in England!
