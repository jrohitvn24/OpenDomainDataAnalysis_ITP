		<title>19Changes During Living Memory</title>
		<content>   After interviews with senior        
 Dentonians children in the Primary    
 School found that life continually    
 changes while the countryside remains 
 much the same.House prices which were 
 as little as a few hundred pounds in  
 1940 are now thousands of pounds, so  
 expensive infact that many local young
 couples can't afford to buy them and  
 have to move away from the area they  
 love.                                 
   Transport which consisted of at     
 least one bus a day to Kendal, is now 
 one bus a week on Market Day.Infact if
 it wasn't for Mr Burrow,with his taxis
 some people would never go out of     
 Dent.                                 
    There are fewer shops now than in  
 the 1940's then there was a butcher a 
 baker and a shoemaker.More people own 
 cars today.We are fortunate to have an
 excellent garage in Dent.             </content>
