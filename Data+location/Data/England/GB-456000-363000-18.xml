		<title>18My Pets</title>
		<content>  These are the pets I own:3 dogs, 4   
 cats,2 rabbits, 1 canary, 1           
 budgerigar, 1 hamster, and 1 gerbil.  
 Soon I will have another rabbit and a 
 guinea pig.                           
  I have more different kinds of pet   
 than any other child at Samuel Barlow 
 School. We have so many because my mum
 loves pets. I like all of them but my 
 favourite is is the canary. We care   
 well for all of our pets. My mum has  
 worked out that it costs us about Â£4 a
 week to look after them.              
  People have pets for their company;  
 it's especially nice for elderly      
 people living on their own to have    
 'someone' to talk to,love and care    
 for.
