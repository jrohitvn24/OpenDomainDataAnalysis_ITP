		<title>15Mary Deans School</title>
		<content> Mary Dean was the founder of our      
 school.She set up a Charity School in 
 a house she bought in Tamerton Foliot 
 in 1720.The school was not endowed    
 until her death in October 1734.      
    Last year we celebrated  the 250th 
 anniversary of her death and our      
 headmaster and the chairman of the    
 governers laid a wreath on her grave  
 at Bickleigh Church.                  
    The school remained in Mary Dean's 
 house for 140 years.Mary Dean said    
 that there were to be"Twenty poor boys
 from the parish,and no more",and they 
 were to be taught to read and write,  
 to learn arithmetic, and to be        
 instructed in their principles of the 
 Christian religion.                   
    The school moved to Rock Hill      
 School in 1870 to provide more places.
 Our new school was opened in 1975.
