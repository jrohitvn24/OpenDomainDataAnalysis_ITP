		<title>14A Watford Mum's Monday.</title>
		<content>Mum gets up at about 7.15am and has    
breakfast with  Dad. She then makes    
the beds and tidies up and helps my    
sister to get organised for school.    
Then she drags me out of bed and gets  
ready for work. She leaves at 8.45am to
go to our local Infant School where she
is a Welfare Assistant. At noon she    
comes home, usually doing some shopping
on the way and gets lunch for herself  
and me. Then she has a rest and goes   
back to work. She gets home at 3.20pm  
and either reads the newspaper, plays  
game with me, relaxes, or does         
housework until 6.15pm when she gets   
dinner for the whole family. Afterwards
she relaxes and watches television     
until my bedtime at 9.30pm. Then she   
chats with Dad until they go to bed    
at about 11.00pm.
