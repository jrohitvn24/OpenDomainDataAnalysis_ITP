		<content> ON MY DAD'S FARM THERE ARE FIVE       
 TRACTORS. HIS BIGGEST AND NEWEST IS 82
 HORSE POWER. THAT MEANS IT HAS THE    
 POWER OF 82 HORSES. DURING THE TIME OF
 FIVE HOURS THE TRACTOR COULD PLOUGH   
 1O ACRES OF ROUGH LAND USING A FOUR   
 FURROW REVERSIBLE PLOUGH.             
 THE COMBINE HARVESTER IS USED FOR     
 HARVESTING CEREALS AND RAPE. IT COVERS
 2O-3O ACRES A DAY. ON AVERAGE IT      
 HARVESTS 5O-1OO TONS OF GRAIN. THE    
 GRAIN HAS TO BE LESS THAN 2O% MOISTURE
 CONTENT BEFORE IT CAN BE HARVESTED.   
 RAPE HAS TO BE 12% OR LESS IN MOISTURE
 CONTENT.                              
 ANOTHER MAIN CROP, SUGAR BEET, IS     
 HARVESTED BY A SPECIAL MACHINE. IT CAN
 HARVEST UP TO 2O TONS OF BEET IN A DAY
 OR 5 ACRES. THE BEET ARE TRIMMED BY   
 THE SAME MACHINE AND LOADED ONTO A    
 TRACTOR-DRAWN TRAILER AT THE SIDE.
