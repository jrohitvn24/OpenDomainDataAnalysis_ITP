		<title>03CHILDREN OF STARCROSS</title>
		<content> Most of the children have lived in    
{Starcross}all their lives.They mainly 
 like the area because of the River    
 Exe.Most of the children from         
{Starcross}live in two-storey          
 houses.They wouldn't like to move from
{Starcross}.The children take part in  
 sports,activities,the reason why they 
 take part is that they find sports    
 very enjoyable.The nearest sports     
 centre is in Dawlish,but they have two
 playgrounds.Some people admitted that 
 they would like extra facilities      
 like:football and rugby pitches and an
 adventure playground.The children     
 thought that{Starcross}needed some    
 more shops.The children's parents are 
 employed in many different            
 occupations.Many are outdoor jobs.Some
 work locally and others in Exeter.Some
 of the children live in{Dawlish}and   
{Kenton}and have to travel to school.  </content>
