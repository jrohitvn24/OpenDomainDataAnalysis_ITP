		<title>11TENDRINGS FARM (SITE)</title>
		<content>      The site has always been farmland
 and originally belonged to{Lord       
{Strathcona.}In 1950 the estate was    
 split up and sold. Now{Tendrings House
 stands in 4 acres and the wood around 
 it protects it from the elements as it
 is very exposed. The wood mainly      
 cosists of hazel,blue spruce,silver   
 birch,oak and yew trees. The gardens  
 are extensive and contain many shrubs 
 and a vegetable plot.                 
      There is still evidence of the   
 old farm buildings including a{cow    
{shed}with the{original oak beams.}This
 particular building is now used to    
 house cars. The original{granary}still
 remains. This is a small wooden       
 building raised by bricks to deter    
 rats. This building is still totally  
 water-proof with the roof supported by
 oak beams.
