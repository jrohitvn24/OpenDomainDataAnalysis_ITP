		<title>03Evacuation Part 1</title>
		<content> It started off as a{meeting}in the   {
 church.Just before Christmas.People   
 were told that they had to be         
 evacuated and that the area had to be 
 cleared by{20th December 1943.}       
 Farmers had to take their livestock to
 the knackers yard and sell their      
 machinery. Some people travelled as   
 far as{Cornwall}or{Yorkshire,}some    
 travelled as close as{Ashprington}(a  
 village a few miles away).            
 Most of the old people who were       
 evacuated never returned to           
 Blackawton.                           
                                       
 The American troops practised for{D}  
{Day}on{Slapton}sands.On one practice  
 something went wrong,hundreds of      
 soldiers died and a tank sank.People  
 were not allowed back to the area     
 until the{autumn of 1944.}
