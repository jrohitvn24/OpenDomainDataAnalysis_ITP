		<title>14PRISON PROTEST AT DENBURY</title>
		<content>    In Denbury there is a prison       
 called Channings Wood and it is run by
 the Home Office.They dont have major  
 criminals there at the moment but they
 are thinking of taking people who have
 committed more serious crimes and     
 who have to serve longer sentences.   
    There was a protest meeting held   
 in Denbury Village Hall on 17th June. 
    I do not think it is a good idea to
 have these prisoners at Denbury. Many 
 minor offenders have already escaped  
 and this will get much worse.         
 The Home Office would have to make    
 the security better.If they did       
 that,Channings Wood would gradually   
 become a Category B prison, and we    
 would have many more dangerous        
 prisoners.
