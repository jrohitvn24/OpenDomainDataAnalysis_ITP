		<content>  We have collected information about  
{employment}of the parents of          
 children in Ombersley School. Class   
 two took home questionaires for our   
 parents to fill in. The questions were
 about where they work, what sort of   
 work they do, how many hours they work
 in a week, how long they have been in 
 that job, and how many people live in 
 the house. The information was brought
 back to Ombersley School and put on   
 a data base to collate it. We found   
 that a third of the people{work in    
{Droitwich.}In the families surveyed   
 one third of the people worked. The   
 average{hours worked}were 45 per week,
 the average length of employment being
 9 years. The most common jobs are     
 teachers and landworkers but the      
 employment was pretty varied.
