		<content> ALONG THE A66 THE NORTH AND SOUTH     
 SIDES OF THE ROAD ARE DIFFERENT.THIS  
 IS BECAUSE THE NORTH SIDE IS HILLY AND
 ROUGH GRASS BECAUSE IT IS THE ARMY    
 RANGE,AND THE SOUTH SIDE IS NICE      
 CULTIVATED LAND.                      
 IN GREAT MUSGRAVE THERE IS A FIELD    
 WITH LYNCHETS.THEY WERE MADE BY THE   
 PEOPLE IN THE BRONZE AGE LONG BEFORE  
 THE ROMANS CAME AND THEY ARE STILL    
 THERE.THEY WERE BUILT ON A HILLSIDE   
 BECAUSE IN THOSE DAYS THE LOWLAND WAS 
 BOGGY.                                
 IN FLITHOLME THERE IS A BUSINESS      
 WHICH SELLS TRACTORS AND OTHER FARM   
 MACHINERY.LAND AROUND FLITHOLME AND   
 MUSGRAVE IS GOOD SHEEP AND CATTLE     
 GRAZING.                              
 THERE ARE TWO FARMS IN BROUGH AND     
 THREE FARMS IN CHURCH BROUGH.THE LAND 
 IN THE NORTH UP HILLBECK IS VERY HILLY
 ESPECIALLY ON THE PENNINE FELLS.      </content>
