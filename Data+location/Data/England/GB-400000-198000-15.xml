		<title>15SIDDINGTON SHEPHERD</title>
		<content> I'm a shepherd.We have 600 ewes.They  
 are housed and shorn in January and   
 stay inside till lambing.This begins  
 in mid-March and lasts a month.At     
 lambing time I start work at 4am.As   
 each ewe lambs she and her lamb are   
 taken to smaller pens. Each lamb      
 receives a dose of anti-biotics and   
 has iodine sprayed on its navel.The   
 ewe has hay and water.Some ewes need  
 help lambing.These I attend to.Lamb   
 stealing by other ewes is a problem   
 too.At 7.30 my assistants arrive.Their
 jobs are:feeding silage and hay,pen   
 cleaning,footrotting ewes and taking  
 ewes and lambs to pasture.Cold,wet    
 weather is a killer for young lambs.I 
 treat hypothermic ones by injecting   
 glucose into their stomachs and       
 warming them. Another job, adopting   
 triplets or orphan lambs to ewes with 
 single or dead lambs.Work ends at 6.30</content>
