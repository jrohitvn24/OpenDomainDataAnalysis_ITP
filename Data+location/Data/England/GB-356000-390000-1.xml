		<content>   The area around{Burtonwood village  
 has been, and still is, very much     
 a{farming}area. An old school log     
 book of the late{1800's}often refers  
 to the large number of absentees      
 during hay making.                    
   South of the village is the old site
 of{Burtonwood American Air Base}which 
 was reputed to be the largest in      
 Europe and saw much activity during   
 the Second World War.An American Base 
 remains, as a storage depot for{Euro- 
{pean U.S. Army}equipment. Part of the 
 old aerodrome is now the property of  
 Warrington{New Town Development.      
{ }The{Psychiatric Hospital}at{Winwick 
 played a vital part during the{World  
{Wars}as a{military hospital.}So great 
 were the numbers of wounded that a    
 special branch line was built from the
 main railway line to transport        
{soldiers}into hospital.               </content>
