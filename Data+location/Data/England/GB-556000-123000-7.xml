		<title>07PIG FARMING</title>
		<content> PIG FARMING IS NOT PRACTISED ON A     
 LARGE SCALE IN THIS AREA BUT AS A     
 SIDELINE TO MAIN FARMING ACTIVITIES. A
 TYPICAL PIG UNIT ONLY CONTAINS 25 TO  
 30 SOWS AND 2 BOARS. THE MAIN BREEDS  
 ENCOUNTERED ARE GLOUCESTER OLD SPOTS, 
 SADDLEBACKS, AND THE RARE BERKSHIRES  
 ALTHOUGH THE LARGE WHITE IS BETTER FOR
 MEAT. THE AVERAGE LITTER IS 13 BUT AT 
 4 TO 5 YEARS, THE SOWS PRODUCE LESS   
 PIGLETS AND ARE SLAUGHTERED FOR HAM   
 AND PIES. THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF A     
 FULLY GROWN SOW IS 150 KILOS. PIGLETS 
 ARE EITHER SOLD AT 4 TO 6 WEEKS TO    
 OTHER FARMS FOR BREEDING OR FATTENING 
 OR SOLD FOR PORK AT 4 MONTHS. PIGS ARE
 PRONE TO OVER 100 DISEASES, ALL VERY  
 INFECTIOUS. FARMERS COMPLAIN THAT PIG 
 FARMING IS NOT VERY PROFITABLE DUE TO 
 THE HIGH COST OF PIG FOOD AND THE LOW 
 PRICE OF PORK. E.G. 28 SOWS ONLY BRING
 IN A PROFIT OF Â£500.00 PER YEAR.      </content>
