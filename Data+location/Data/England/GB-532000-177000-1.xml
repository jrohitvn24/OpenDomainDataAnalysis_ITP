		<content> The area is predominantly high-density
 council housing estates. There are no 
 main shopping areas and very few      
 recreational facilities. Interspersed 
 throughout the block are commercial   
 areas comprising of both modern       
 distribution and older occasionally   
 redundant warehouses. The overall     
 impression is of neglect - there is a 
 fair amount of wasteland and boarded- 
 up buildings. The food shops reflect  
 the ethnic mix of the population,     
 including Jellied Eel Shops, Fish and 
 Chip Shops, Halal meat Shops, Chinese 
 and Indian Take-Aways. There is an    
 active Civic Centre that puts on      
 concerts and Art Exhibitions by local 
 artists. The Museum is child-         
 orientated and encourages school      
 groups to visit. The gas-works        
 dominates the landscape. The area has 
 a high rate of unemployment.          </content>
