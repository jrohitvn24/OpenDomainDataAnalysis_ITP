		<title>16Pendomer: Leisure</title>
		<content> For those who live in Pendomer,       
 leisure activities necessitate a      
 journey at least to Hardington or East
 Coker, more probably Yeovil. Halstock,
 however, is particularly well supplied
 with activity groups for a village of 
 its size (less than 400 inhabitants). 
 There is a large WI, both a men's and 
 women's Royal British Legion, music   
 group, youth club, amenities group and
 a very active horticultural society,  
 which among other things holds two    
 shows a year. (There are many keen    
 gardeners in the village!) All these  
 groups forgather in the school.       
 Serious cultural entertainment such as
 orchestral concerts, opera or drama   
 are not so easy. It is necessary to   
 travel to Exeter or Bath for most such
 outings - forty plus miles each way,  
 no joke on a winter evening.
