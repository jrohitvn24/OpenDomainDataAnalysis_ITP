		<content> To the south of Shanklin is{Horseledge
{Point.}We explored Horseledge point,  
 there were lots of rockpools. In the  
 rockpools there were lots of  sea     
 anemones. They eat lots of prawns.    
 Their tentacles can sting when they   
 are open. We saw some crabs. A crab   
 starts life in a shell. Then it breaks
 out of its shell and scuttles along   
 the beach. On the rocks and in the    
 pools are many different kinds of     
 seaweed. The green seaweed is called  
 sea lettuce. The red seaweed is called
 Phycodrys Rubens and has oak shaped   
 leaves. The brown seaweed is flat     
 with air bubbles to keep it afloat.   
 These are also called Wracks.         
 Horseledge is very rocky. Limpets     
 cling to the rocks with a very strong 
 foot. They are many in number.{It is a
{dangerous,place to visit when the tide
{is coming in.                         </content>
