		<title>04HASTINGS COUNTRY PARK E.S.</title>
		<content> Hastings Country Park covers 500 acres
 along the coast from Hastings to      
 Fairlight village, East Sussex.       
 Farmland borders the park to the      
 north, and to the south vertical      
 cliffs face the sea.   The clifftop is
 fenced off and there are warning signs
{DANGEROUS CLIFFS.}  Deciduous woods   
 grow in the steep valleys and gorse   
 and heather cover the remaining land. 
 Many footpaths criss-cross the Park   
 and it is a very popular dog-walking  
 area for both visitors and the local  
 people.   Public toilets and a car    
 park are provided, by Fairlight Church
                                       
 There is a Coastguard Lookout point at
 the eastern end of the Park, with an  
 excellent view of the Channel, and the
 coastline to the east to Rye, Camber  
 Sands and Dungeness Nuclear Power     
 Station.                              </content>
