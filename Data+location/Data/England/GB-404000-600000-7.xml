		<content> Our school is "Church of England      
 Aided" and there is a close link      
 between All Saints church and         
 ourselves. We have a morning assembly 
 each day and the rector attends on    
 Friday. At times like Christmas,      
 Easter and the end of summer term we  
 all walk down the hill to the church  
 for a service and as there are about  
 two hundred of us, the church is      
 almost full.                          
 One of the oldest things in the church
 is part of a Saxon cross which is the 
 stem part of the font. It is a work of
 art. Some parts of the church date    
 back to the thirteenth century but    
 some of it was rebuilt in the         
 nineteenth century. When the church is
 full for our service we play musical  
 instruments and it sounds good.
