		<title>19TIME-SERVICES IN WALSALL</title>
		<content> Time governs many of the activities of
 the town -                            
 Milk is delivered at breakfast time,  
   as are the first letters. There     
   is one dairy which delivers much    
   later than this. The second post is 
   at lunch-time.                      
 Most newsagents employ newsboys who   
   deliver national newspapers at      
   breakfast-time and local papers, the
   "Express and Star" (Walsall edition)
   and the "Evening Mail", at tea-time.
   The "Walsall Observer" is delivered 
   weekly as are the 'free' papers,    
   the "Trader" and the "Advertiser."  
 Street lights come on at dusk and go  
   off at dawn.                        
 Refuse is collected weekly.           
 West Midlands Passenger Transport     
   Executive has a depot within the    
   area which has regular services to  
   all parts of the town and beyond.   </content>
