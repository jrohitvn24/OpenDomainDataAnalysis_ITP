		<title>07HISTORIC BUILDINGS IN RIPON</title>
		<content> On the south side of the market place 
 stands the town hall completed in 1801
 as a town house and assembly room for 
 Mrs Elizabeth Allanson of studley     
 royal to a design by Wyatt.During     
 the nineteenth century,records were   
 kept there and the corporation was    
 allowed to meet every year in one of  
 the first floor rooms.In 1897 the     
 marquess of Ripon(then the owner)     
 presented the building to the city to 
 commemorate his year in office as     
 mayor(1895-1896).                     
                                       
 Ripon Cathedral                       
 Saint Wilfrid built the first church  
 thirteen hundred years ago,and when he
 died he was buried in this church of  
 his.All that is left in Wilfrids      
 Church is the Saxon crypt. Very little
 remains of the Norman church.
