		<title>20The future of Locks Heath</title>
		<content>  Locks Heath has a{rich historical and
{cultural heritage}.However,the area is
 not only concerned with the past.Plans
 have to be made in order to prepare   
 for the future needs of the           
 community.To this end a wide ranging  
 development brief has been drawn up.  
  The{"Western Wards of Fareham Action 
{Area Plan"}contains information which 
 establishes the broad principles of   
 development in{South Hampshire}.It    
 proposes that many more houses shall  
 be built with associated increases in 
 the number of schools,shops,community 
 centres and leisure areas.It stresses 
 that there should be sensitive        
 landscaping so that the natural beauty
 of the area be preserved.             
  Clearly,the area surrounding Locks   
 Heath will be subjected to a great    
 deal of change,but not necessarily at 
 the expense of the existing community.</content>
