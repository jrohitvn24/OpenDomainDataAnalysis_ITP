		<title>13MEMORIALS IN LITTLE BADDOW</title>
		<content> St.Marys Church has a beautiful nave  
 which includes 14th century arched    
 recesses in the south wall.These      
 recesses contain 2 wooden effigies    
 which have been skillfully carved and 
 well preserved.They are of a lady and 
 gentleman whose costume dates them    
 from 1340-1350.It is possible that    
 they are of the Filiol family who were
 strict in their religion.At the feet  
 of these 2 are fine carvings of dogs. 
   On the north side of the chancel is 
 the Mildmay monument.This is a stone  
 effigy that was erected to Sir Henry  
 Mildmay,of Graces Manor,who died in   
 1639.He is portrayed in a recumbant   
 position,clad in his armour and at his
 feet are his 2 wives.It is possible   
 that this monument was the work of    
 Nicholas Stone.Some fragments of      
 medieval glass,2 brass inscriptions   
 and a 15th century chest can be seen. </content>
