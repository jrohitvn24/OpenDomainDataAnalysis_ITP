		<title>17 OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>I attend St.Mary's Roman Catholic      
Middle School for pupils between the   
ages of nine to thirteen years and who 
belong to the Catholic church. We have 
eight periods a day each lasting thirty
five minutes. A full lesson is two     
periods long although for some subjects
like French we have one period making  
up a single lesson. In our school we   
wear uniform mainly blue in colour.    
We have a large gymnasium and hall.    
There is a science laboratory and      
several large craft rooms. We can have 
a cooked meal at lunchtimes but because
of the cost a lot of people prefer to  
bring sandwiches instead. I enjoy      
school very much but am always thankful
when I get home and able to finish my  
homework. I can then relax and enjoy   
watching television.
