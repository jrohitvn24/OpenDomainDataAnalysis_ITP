		<content>     We had a walk around the village  
 and found that many houses were made  
 of stone. We saw a Victorian post box 
 and  the war memorial with a sign on  
 it which said 'In memory of those who 
 died in the first and second world    
 wars.'                                
     There were some almond,rowan and  
 cherry trees growing near the war     
 memorial.                             
         Opposite the memorial was St. 
 Mary's church which was built in      
 1450.On the roof inside the porch     
 there was a carving of a lion's head  
 which was the emblem of the Pomeroy   
 family.                               
   Inside the church we saw the very   
 old tomb of the Seymour family. Lord  
 Seymour was the Lord Protector of     
 England and he had eleven children in 
 his family.
