		<title>08JOBS FOR THE GIRLS</title>
		<content>In the summer of 1985 the West Suffolk 
Federation of Womens Institutes set its
members a competition "Here is a fiver 
make it go forth and multiply".        
Chevington W.I.'s idea was a variation 
on 'Bob-a-Job' charging a little more  
than a bob, anything legal, feasible   
and in good taste was considered.      
We undertook gardening (oh the stinging
nettles and my aching back), knitting, 
housework, car washing, cake baking,   
flower arranging, feeding a cat, jam   
making, washing-up and waitressing.    
We raised over 190 pounds (10% of which
we were allowed to keep for our own    
funds) towards the cost of repairs to  
our Head Quarters in Whiting Street,   
Bury St. Edmunds.                      
We won the prize, a clock, for the best
idea.
