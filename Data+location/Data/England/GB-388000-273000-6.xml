		<title>06CHADDESLEY CORBETT CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Church in Chaddesley Corbett is   
 believed to have replaced one that was
 near the present site in Saxon Times. 
 The original Domesday Book indicates  
 that Chaddesley was of considerable   
 importance both before and after the  
 Norman Conquest and records two       
 priests there. The Norman Church dates
 from the middle of the 12th Century   
 and is dedicated to St. Cassian.      
 There is a cross legged effigy thought
 to commemorate Roger Corbett who died 
 in 1290 and an effigy of a priest     
 thought to be Roger Corbett Rector in 
 1306. There is a brass plate to Thomas
 Forest (Keeper of Dunclent Park) and  
 his family which dates from 1511 and  
 several memorials to the Packingtons  
 of Harvington Hall.                   
 The most important features are the   
 Norman Font and the fragment of a     
 sculpture "vesica piscis".            </content>
