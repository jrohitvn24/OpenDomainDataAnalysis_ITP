    I get up in the morning at 7.45    
 a.m., get dressed and washed then I go
  down stairs .My mum gets my breakfast
 ready. I have rice crackles.Then my   
 mum makes my lunch for school. I brush
 my hair and put my shoes on. My mum   
 puts my lunch in my bag. I kiss her   
 and set off for school at 8.30. My    
 school is Ripon Cathedral C.E. Primary
 School. I get to school at 8.45a.m. I 
 play for a while in the playground. At
 9.00a.m., we line up as the bell goes.
 We go in for lessons. At 9.10a.m, we  
 go for assembly.In the afternoon, I   
 like art and craft.When we go home at 
 4.45p.m., I get some different clothes
 on. I have my tea and wash up. After  
 my tea, I play football. I like being 
 in goal. At 7.00p.m., I go home, put  
 my pyjamas on and get washed. Later, I
 go to bed. I sleep like a log.        </content>
