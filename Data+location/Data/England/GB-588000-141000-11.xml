		<title>11Smarden - Local Goverment</title>
		<content> Smarden residents are represented in  
 the British &amp; European parliaments,   
 the Kent County and Ashford Borough   
 Councils and the Parish Council. All  
 elections take place in the village   
 hall with an above average turn out.  
 The County and Borough Councils       
 organise meetings on matters of local 
 interest such as planning which are   
 lively and well attended. The annual  
 parish meeting takes place in April   
 when the 9 councillors report to and  
 are questioned by the electorate.     
 Particular interest is shown in       
 planning with the aim of preserving   
 the village's unique character. The   
 council's duty is to advise the       
 borough on planning, housing and      
 traffic and to manage the parish      
 property - the burial ground, sports  
 grounds and the parish pump - for     
 which they receive a penny rate.      </content>
