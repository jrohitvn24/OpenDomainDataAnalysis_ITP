		<title>13Old Churches,Bromley,S.E.</title>
		<content>There are two very old churches in the 
area.There was a church in Farnborough 
in 1292 when a licence was issued for a
yearly fair on the Feast of St.Giles.  
The church was re-built in 1639 after  
being blown down in a storm.It was     
re-built by the villagers,using local  
flint.The tomb of Gypsy Rose Lee,the   
Queen of the Gypsies,is in the         
grave-yard.15,000 people went to her   
funeral.                               
St.Martin of Tours,Chelsfield,C of E,is
separated from the village of          
Chelsfield by the A224,and dates back  
to Norman times.The sayingÂ£bold as     
brass' originated from Brass Crosby,   
whose memorial is in the nave.He was   
responsible for the freedom to report  
parliamentary proceedings.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
