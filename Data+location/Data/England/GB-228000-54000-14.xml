		<content> The villages are served by the B3247  
 which forms the main street and part  
 of the coastal link between Plymouth  
 and Looe.Satellite hamlets and farms  
 interconnect by a network of single   
 track lanes.Most personal transport is
 by car,the bus service being limited  
 to a once daily link with Plymouth.   
 Inevitably extensive commuter traffic 
 is generated.Holiday visitors overload
 the roads and the limited car parks in
 summer hence seasonal waiting         
 restrictions near the beaches.Some    
 recent improvement has been made with 
 the construction of the new bridge at 
 Seaton.Some use is made of the rail   
 link at St.Germans.The elderly and    
 those without cars rely on friends or 
 the monthly shopping coach to reach   
 the metropolitan services of Plymouth.
 It is fortunate that the shops and    
 surgery provide for most urgent needs </content>
