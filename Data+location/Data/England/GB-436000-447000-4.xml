		<content>           Sunday                      
                                       
  There was going to be a barbecue     
 yesterday, but it was called off for  
 another week. The sun was shining and 
 nothing was going to stop this one.   
 Woke up, had breakfast and got ready  
 for the barbecue. 12 noon. We were    
 off! Got my food, bought a drink and a
 cake and went to have a look round the
 stalls. It was 2 p.m. when we arrived 
 back home. I carried on with my Airfix
 model, then I played on the computer. 
 7 p.m....tea time! I was very full    
 after the barbecue so I didn't have   
 very much. 9 p.m. My brother and I had
 a pillow fight and then we were ready 
 for bed. I went to sleep. Well, I     
 tried to!                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
