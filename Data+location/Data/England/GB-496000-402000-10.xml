		<title>10Dentons Farm visit</title>
		<content> Willow farm, known locally as Dentons,
 is near the centre of the village in  
 East st.The Denton family have owned  
 the land for over 60 years and run it 
 almost entirely alone.The flat land   
 but variety of soils has little       
 influence on the type of farming but  
 the further away from the river the   
 more productive the fields.The        
 farmstead is peripheral,lying to the  
 north of the fields,but the holding is
 compact around a central area.Some of 
 the old buildings have changed their  
 use.One of the buildings we visited   
 used to be a cart shed and is now a   
 pig breeding unit and hoppers are     
 replacing the need to store fodder.   
 the farming enterprise varis from     
 livestock,cereals,roots and fodder    
 crops, using as much available space  
 as possible because as Mr Bowers our  
 guide put it "space is money".        </content>
