		<title>08FARMING 3 KING'S FRUIT FM.</title>
		<content> One of the farms in Ford End is a     
{fruit farm}belonging to Mr. Marvin. A 
 group of us went to talk to him and he
 showed us round.                      
   He has orchards of apple and pear   
 trees and he also grows soft fruit-   
 strawberries, raspberries, black-     
 currants, red currants, and goose-    
 berries.                              
   He has a shop at the farm but most  
 of his fruit is sent away to shops and
 markets. He has a cold store to keep  
 the fruit fresh.                      
   People can go and pick their own    
 soft fruit. On July 10th. 1985,they   
 cost 40p for strawberries, 52p for    
 raspberries and 25p for gooseberries.
