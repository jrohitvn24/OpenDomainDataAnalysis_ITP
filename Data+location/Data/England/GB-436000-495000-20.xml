 category roads.On its west side is the
 A167 giving access to Darlington and  
 linking with the main A1 trunk road to
 London and Scotland.To the east the   
 A684 provides a link with the A19     
 trunk road.The village is served by a 
 regular bus service to Darlington in  
 one direction and Northallerton in    
 the other.There are 7 buses on a      
 weekday and 4 on Sundays.Additionally 
 on market days,Wednesday and Saturday,
 a coach company based in the village  
 runs a half_hourly service to and from
 Northallerton,1.5 miles away.A railway
 goods line passes along the west side 
 of the village going north to         
 Teesside.An average of 20 trains per  
 day necessitate the closing of the    
 level crossing in the village.
