		<content> By visiting the local library at      
Wilnecote and writing to the local     
schools we were able to find out what  
activities were for all ages. We       
discovered that there were 146         
different clubs in our block.There are 
at least 22 sporting clubs including   
cricket, football,keep fit,cycling,    
archery and boxing. There 20 clubs for 
women,mainly Womens Institutes and 13  
Working Mens Clubs and Social Clubs.   
For younger people there are 8 Cub     
Packs,10 Scout and 11 Guide Packs, 11  
Youth Clubs and 2 Boys Brigades. For   
the elderly there were 9 clubs.As well 
as 2 Jazz Bands there were 15 other    
local clubs of which the most unusual  
was the international Cliff Richard    
Movement.                              
Nobody could say there was nothing to  
do around here!
