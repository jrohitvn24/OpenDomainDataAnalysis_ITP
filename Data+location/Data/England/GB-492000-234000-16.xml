		<content> Woburn Sands has two Banks in the High
 Street, Barclays and Nat.West. In     
 addition there are banking facilities 
 for members of the Co-operative Bank  
 at the local Co-op shop.  The Post    
 Office operates a National Savings    
 Bank facility and Girobank.   There   
 are also agencie of the Gateway,      
 Halifax and Nationwide Building       
 Societies.                            
 Yesterday we went to the NatWest Bank 
 and while we were waiting to go inside
 Nathan pressed a fifty pound button.  
 Mrs Porter had said not to touch      
 anything.  The manager showed us to a 
 room where they type letters, then we 
 went to see the safe. The walls, floor
 and ceiling are concrete. They have   
 3000 customers.(Michelle)             
 You can be a member of the Little     
 Extra Club.You get lots of good things
 and a card on your birthday.(Amy)     </content>
