		<title>15Police in Soham</title>
		<content>   In Soham there are{eight constables 
 and{one Sergeant.}Two policeman are   
 resident constables and the rest are  
 section officers.The residents look   
 after Soham while the section officers
 drive Panda cars throughout the area. 
   Resident officers patrol around the 
 town to prevent offences and to get to
 know the local people.The section     
 officers go out in their Panda cars   
 and deal with any messages put through
 to them such as traffic accidents or  
 offences, crimes, fires or other      
 emergencies.                          
   The most common offence in this area
 is vandalism followed by theft, but in
 recent years there has been less anti-
 social behaviour.Relationships between
 the police and the public are usually 
 good, but the police are always glad  
 of any assistance in preventing crime.
