		<content>{ Shucknall Court,}owned by Mr.Moore   
 since 1905, is 200 years old. The land
 amounts to 250 acres of which 70 acres
 are orchards.{Cider apples}are grown, 
 varieties include the French Michelin,
 Dabinett, the English Brown Snout and 
 Bulmers Norman. Spraying, grass       
 cutting, apple picking, and apple     
 shaking machines are used on the farm.
 Rabbit-proof fences surrounding the   
 orchard are effective.                
  The apples need cross pollenators and
 insecticides are also necessary.      
 Tractors with trailers transport the  
 apples (which sell at Â£82.50 per ton) 
 to{Bulmers}in Hereford.               
  The farm employs 2 full time day     
 workers, working an 8 to 10 hour day. 
 The busiest time in the year is the   
 Autumn, when the apples are harvested.
 50 trees may be planted to replace    
 those that have died this year.       </content>
