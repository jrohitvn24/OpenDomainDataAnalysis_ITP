		<title>18CESSNA FLIGHT FROM TEESSIDE</title>
		<content>    We tried to put our survey area    
 into perspective by flying over a     
 wider area of Teesside in a small,    
{4-seater Cessna plane. }              
    The pilot was our art teacher. We  
 were made temporary members of the    
 Airport Flying Club before our flight 
 could begin. Then, we walked towards  
 the blue and white plane.             
    The pilot checked that everything  
 was secure. After getting the "okay"  
 from the control tower, we moved      
 slowly onto the runway. As we picked  
 up speed, the plane was vibrating from
 head to tail. Suddenly,  we were no   
 longer on the ground, but tilted      
 backwards and going upwards.          
    Unfortunately, it was a very cloudy
 and windy day, so to avoid being      
 bumped around too much, we went higher
 than the l,500 feet, which would have 
 been best for seeing the land below.  </content>
