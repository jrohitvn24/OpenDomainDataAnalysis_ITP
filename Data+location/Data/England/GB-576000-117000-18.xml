		<content> I do Modern Dancing which is like     
 ballet but looser. I also do Tap in   
 which you wear special shoes to tap a 
 rhythm as you dance.                  
 Brownies is a kind of club for girls  
 and we have brown uniforms. We talk   
 about things and play games. We go on 
 Brownie Pack holidays and present     
 shows.                                
 Stoolball is a sport in which you have
 to hit a ball and get runs for your   
 team whilst the other side tries to   
 prevent this.                         
 I play two musical instruments. The   
 recorder is a wind instrument. It is  
 great fun playing the piano. I am on  
 Grade Three and have to play scales.  
 I like riding my bike very fast up and
 down our lane because there is no     
 traffic along it.
