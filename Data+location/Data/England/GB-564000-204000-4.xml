		<content> Most of the fields surrounding Writtle
 are used for cereal crops.Avalon is a 
 type of winter wheat used for milling 
 to make high-grade flour for bread.   
 Some winter wheat that is grown is    
 milled and used either for animal feed
 or as low-quality biscuit flour.      
        Spring barley is sown in April 
 and harvested in August or September. 
 The barley is used for malting or     
 stock-feed.The spring oats that we saw
 growing are used for horse-feed.      
        One farmer grew Spring beans.  
 These beans are the size of small peas
 and are used for feed for tame pigeons
 or exported to Saudi Arabia where they
 are used for stock-feed.              
        Rye and clover grass is cut and
 used for hay for horses,some grass is 
 cut and stored in huge polythene bags 
 until it becomes silage for cows.
