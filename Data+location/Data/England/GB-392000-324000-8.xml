John Wheeldon First School.            
                                       
     The original school on this site  
was opened in 1895,being the first     
built by Stafford School Board. It     
took children from  5 to 14 years in   
classes of sixty. The first headmaster 
was John Wheeldon, later Mayor of      
Stafford.Three separate schools for    
boys, girls and infants later grew on  
the site. Mr.Wheeldon remained         
headmaster of the boys until 1922. The 
school subsequently adopted his name.  
     Subsidence caused by old salt mine
workings resulted in rebuilding of the 
school into a single storey primary for
boys and girls in 1968.                
     Since reorganisation four years   
ago we are now a First School with 281 
children from 4 to 9 years.
