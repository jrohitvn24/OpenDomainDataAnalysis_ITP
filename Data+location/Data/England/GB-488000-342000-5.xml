		<title>05A WORKING MOTHER'S DAY</title>
		<content> The mother in question works part-time
 as a teacher.  She usually gets up at 
 7.30 and wakes the children.  They    
 have breakfast and she prepares a     
 packed lunch for the whole family.    
 She then washes the breakfast things  
 and drives the children to school.    
 At about 9.00 she leaves for work at a
 Grantham school where she is employed 
 for 3 hours a day.  She then drives   
 to the Teacher's Centre where she has 
 her packed lunch and works for 2      
 hours.                                
 She returns to collect the children   
 from school and makes their evening   
 meal, after which she washes the      
 dishes and tidies the house. The      
 children read regularly to their      
 mother at this time and then she puts 
 them to bed. The mother then has a cup
 of coffee, watches televsion and goes 
 to bed herself at about 11.00.        </content>
