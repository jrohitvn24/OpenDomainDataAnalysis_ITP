		<title>12A BREWERY IN BURTON</title>
		<content>Page 2 (of 2)                          
   Marstons is very much a regional    
brewery for the area round Burton, but 
has other sites scattered from Penrith 
to Winchester. They own 884 public     
houses, mostly in the Midlands, but    
their beer is sold as far away as the  
'Bon Accord' in Glasgow.               
   Burton owes its breweries to the    
local water, which rises through a     
gypsum layer, and gives the beer its   
sparkle. They became famous in  the    
days of empire, when Burton beer was   
sent all over the world for the troops.
   Now smaller breweries are steadily  
being amalgamated, although the volume 
brewed has risen greatly since the war.
Younger people now prefer lager instead
of the traditional English bitter, and 
public houses are becoming more a part 
of the family leisure industry instead 
of just drinking places.               </content>
