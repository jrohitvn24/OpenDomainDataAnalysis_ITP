		<title>13PARISH CHURCH OF ST. ANDREW</title>
		<content> The first record of a church in the   
 village of Okeford Fitzpaine is       
 in 1302, although the present church  
 dates from 1866.  It was almost       
 entirely rebuilt using much of the    
 materials of the original church. The 
 tower,hoever, dates from an earlier   
 time, the lower part possibly from    
 1302.                                 
 Rev.Pomeroy is the rector of four     
 churches, Okeford Fitzpaine, Ibberton,
 Belchalwell and Woolland.  He has been
 a vicar for 19 years and became       
 ordained because,he said,"I felt God  
 wanted me to." He is helped in the    
 parish by Rev. Walter who is an       
 honorary curate. He sees his job as   
 understanding people's prblems and    
 helping them to understand God.
