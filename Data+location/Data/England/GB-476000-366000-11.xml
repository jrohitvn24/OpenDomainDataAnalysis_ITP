		<content>   With the range of roads in the area,
 there is a wide variety of traffic,   
 from{bicycles}and{cars}to{coaches}and 
 long-distance{lorries,}not forgetting 
 the farm{tractors}and other vehicles  
 frequently spotted en route.          
   As there are no shops in the area,  
 with the exception of a P.O. at Weston
 and 2{mobile shops,}every family needs
 some form of personal transport, maybe
{bicycles}for local use and cars for   
 longer journeys and carrying luggage. 
   A circular{bus service,}operated by 
 National Travel, passes through the   
 villages once a day on weekdays. There
 is no Sunday service.                 
   The main Eastern{rail}route, London 
 to Scotland, runs almost parallel to  
 the A1. There is an automatic barrier 
 crossing on the line, in frequent use,
 with road access to Sutton by this    
 route restricted to daylight hours.   </content>
