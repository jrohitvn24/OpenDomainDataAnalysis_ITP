		<title>08THE KNUTSFORD BAND</title>
		<content>   Knutsford Band is a self-supporting 
 voluntary organisation and there is   
 much good will towards the band       
 throughout the town.                  
   The Band can be called a Brass Band 
 or a Silver Band.  There has been such
 a musical organisation in the town    
 of Knutsford for more than 100 years. 
   Many former Bandsmen still live in  
 Knutsford and district and in several 
 cases memories go back as far as the  
 Band of the 1920's.                   
   There are four regular features in  
 the Band's calendar: The Knutsford    
 Royal May Day Celebrations, the Civic 
 Sunday Parade, the Remembrance Day    
 Parade and the Civic Christmas        
 Concert.The remainder of the calendar 
 is usually made up of a variety of    
 outdoor performances at local garden  
 parties and fetes during the summer   
 and of indoor concerts in winter.     </content>
