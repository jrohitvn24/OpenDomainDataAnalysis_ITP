		<title>13PRIMROSE LANE MILL</title>
		<content> The mill was built in about 1830 but  
 has only been a mill since the 1920's.
 Before then it was a warehouse and the
 lane was called Warehouse Lane. There 
 are about 20 people employed and some 
 of them are paid to operate the 15    
 power looms otherwise known as dog    
 cross that are kept. They make cloth  
 to order to countries world wide such 
 as Japan, Canada, United States,      
 Germany, Italy, France and Austria.   
 When the cloth gets to the foreign    
 countries it is usually sold in       
 tourist shops. They get the raw       
 materials from merchants in Bradford  
 and then they dye it as it is also a  
 dye house and then they make it into  
 ties and hats. Mr. Tunbridge, manager 
 of the mill for 9 years said products 
 have changed with fashion. Most of the
 products are made from the wool of the
 Jacob's sheep.                        </content>
