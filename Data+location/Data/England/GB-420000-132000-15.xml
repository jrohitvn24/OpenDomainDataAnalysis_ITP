		<content>  THERE HAS BEEN A CHURCH ON THIS      
 SITE SINCE SAXON TIMES AND WINTERSLOW 
 PEOPLE STILL WORSHIP GOD HERE. THE    
 OLDEST REMAINING PARTS OF THE BUILDING
 ARE TWO NORMAN ARCHES AND A NORMAN    
 FONT. THE CHURCH WAS ENLARGED IN THE  
 19TH CENTURY AND NOW HOLDS ABOUT 250  
 PEOPLE. THE ORGAN WAS RESTORED IN     
 1982. THE FOUR BELLS ARE RUNG EVERY   
 SUNDAY. THE PRESENT RECTOR IS THE REV.
 CLIVE COHEN. A SERVICE OF PARISH      
 COMMUNION IS HELD EVERY SUNDAY AT     
 10A.M. AND EVENSONG IS SAID ON TWO    
 SUNDAYS EACH MONTH. ABOUT FORTY       
 CHILDREN ATTEND SUNDAY SCHOOL AND     
 THERE IS A BRANCH OF THE MOTHERS'     
 UNION.
