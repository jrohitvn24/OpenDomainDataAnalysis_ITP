		<title>11DERWENT VALLEY - WILD LIFE</title>
		<content>    Despite increasing human pressure, 
 the area abounds in wildlife. Of the  
 larger animals the roe deer, badger   
 and fox are well represented in spite 
 of a long history of persecution. The 
 red squirrel abound whilst the otter, 
 once thought to have disappeared, has 
 been seen recently since the closure  
 of a mink farm near High Spen. Anglers
 use the River Derwent which is stocked
 from a trout farm at Lintzford.       
    Many varieties of birds, both      
 resident and migrant, are in the area.
 The drive, spearheaded by the Angling 
 Club, to reduce pollution, has        
 resulted in the increase of kingfisher
 numbers. Other water birds include    
 heron, dipper, water-hen, mallard,    
 sedge-warbler and pied and grey       
 wagtail. The most common bird of prey 
 is the tawny owl, but kestrel and     
 sparrow-hawk are also found.          </content>
