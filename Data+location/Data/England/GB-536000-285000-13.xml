		<content>    There are a range of Christian     
 churches. These include Baptist, Zion 
 Baptist, Salvation Army, United       
 Reformed, Methodists and Roman        
 Catholic.                             
    The Benedictine Abbey mentioned in 
 the original Domesday Survey no longer
 exists but the church connected with  
 it does - the Church of St Peter and  
 St Paul. The oldest known part is the 
 base of the church tower. Most of the 
 present church dates from after 1300  
 when the original building was        
 destroyed by fire and had to be       
 rebuilt. There was a further extensive
 restoration in 1910. Each year the    
 members of the church have to raise   
 around Â£10,000. This helps to pay the 
 vicar's salary and the running costs  
 of the church itself eg heating. Any  
 money needed for further restoration  
 has to be raised in addition.         </content>
