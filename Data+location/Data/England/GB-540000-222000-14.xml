		<content>   In this area there  is no police,   
 fire or ambulance station but the     
 various emergency services come from  
 the surrounding towns in the event of 
 any trouble or emergency.             
                                       
   The roads are , under normal        
 circumstances very quiet and so are   
 little more than very small and narrow
 country lanes.                        
                                       
   In the summer and Bank holidays,    
 however the situation can be very     
 different and several traffic jams    
 have been caused by this influx of    
 traffic in the school holidays by     
 people on their way to relatives or   
 looking for a shortcut to a costal    
 resort.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
