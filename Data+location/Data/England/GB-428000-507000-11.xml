 the area also have permission to come 
 to this school.                       
  There is a headteacher, two assistant
 teachers and a part-time teacher for  
 nine hours a week. There is also help 
 with clerical work for 10 hours each  
 week. A caretaker,a cook and helper   
 and two supervisory assistants for    
 school lunches make up the staff.     
  The extra-curricular activities      
 include sports and music clubs which  
 meet at lunch times and after school. 
 The pupils take part in inter-school  
 activities, go out on educational     
 outings and have visitors into school 
 to talk and demonstrate a variety of  
 subjects.                             </content>
