		<title>14Carlisle Head Post Office</title>
		<content> The Head Post Office is in Warwick    
 Road, but most mail is now sorted at  
 Junction Street, where the post-coded 
 letters can be sorted mechanically at 
 a rate of 16,000 per hour. Most of our
 survey area falls into the CA1 post-  
 code district, but Scotby's code is   
 CA4 (HPO's code: CA1 1AA !)           
 There are 83 deliveries in the Carl-  
 isle area, serviced by 360 postmen and
 87 counter, administrative, and super-
 visory staff. 450,000 letters are     
 delivered weekly, 75,000 daily.       
 The busiest day in the HPO is Thursday
 (when retirement pensions are paid via
 books of dated coupons), the quietest 
 Wednesday. First-class stamps cost    
 17p, second-class 13p..coming down to 
 12p later this year..perhaps to enc-  
 ourage people to phone less and write 
 more.
