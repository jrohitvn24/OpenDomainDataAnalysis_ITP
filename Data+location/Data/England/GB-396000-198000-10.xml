   THE SOIL TYPES IN THE AREA ARE      
 TYPICAL OF THE COTSWOLD COUNTRYSIDE   
 WITH VARYING DEPTHS OF CLAY LOAM OVER 
 FREE DRAINING ROCK.MANY FIELDS HAVE A 
 HIGH PERCENTAGE OF STONE IN THE       
 SURFACE SOIL.THERE IS USUALLY A LATE  
 START TO SPRING GROWTH. GOOD GROWING  
 CONDITIONS CONDITIONS LAST UNTIL EARLY
 JUNE. DURING HOT SUMMERS THE SOIL IS  
 PRONE TO DROUGHT SO GRAZING AREAS ARE 
 USUALLY SITED ON DEEPER SOILS TO      
 REDUCE THE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT ON THE  
 GRASSLAND.                            
   FARMS IN THE AREA GROW MAINLY WINTER
 WHEAT AND BARLEY.SOME OIL SEED RAPE IS
 GROWN.MOST BARLEY STRAW AND SOME WHEAT
 STRAW IS BALED FOR LIVESTOCK.STUBBLE  
 IS OFTEN BURNT.THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF   
 AGRICULTURE AT CIRENCESTER HAS FARMS  
 ON SOME OF THE LAND AND EXPERIMENTAL  
 PLOTS ARE SOWN.                       </content>
