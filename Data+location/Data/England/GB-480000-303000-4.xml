 The major routes adjacent to the block
 are the A47 Leicester to Peterborough 
 road to the south, and to the north   
 the A606 Nottingham to Stamford (A1)  
 road.                                 
 The main problem with living in the   
 area is that it is too far from these 
 routes and there is no direct access  
 to them. The topography of steep sided
 valley with no road running along the 
 bottom makes access difficult. The    
 road to Leigh Lodge Farm was formerly 
 the main route to Market Harborough   
 from Oakham because the bridge there  
 was the only crossing point of the    
 River Chater.                         
 People tend to live in villages       
 surrounding the area where public     
 transport is available.
