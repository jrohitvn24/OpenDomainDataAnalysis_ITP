 The money to build Holy Trinity Church
 was provided by three sisters who     
 could not accept the evangelical      
 tradition of the Parish Church. Holy  
 Trinity Church was built at the       
 Eastern end of Ventnor close to the   
 Parish boundary with Bonchurch and was
 completed in 1862. It has always had a
 Catholic tradition. The church has a  
 spire which is a prominent landmark in
 Ventnor. The altar is in the nave. The
 Revd.Malcolm Pickering is also Vicar  
 of St. Catherines. Martin Jarman is   
 the Lay Reader. The organist is Mrs.  
 Lisa Burndred. The Church seats 205   
 people and has a regular congregation 
 of about 55. This rises to about 60 in
 summer. There are 8 children attached 
 to the church. The church sends about 
 10% of its previous year's income to  
 charity.                              </content>
