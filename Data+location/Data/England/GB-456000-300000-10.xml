		<title>10BOOT HOUSES - DEFECTS</title>
		<content>      In 1981-2 council houses on the  
{Saffron Lane Estate}were being modern-
 -ised, when defects in the structure  
 of concrete houses was noticed. The   
 houses,{built in 1926-8 by Messrs.    
{Henry Boot &amp; Son,}were found to have  
 crumbling concrete inside the reinfor-
 -ing pillars.                         
      This defect was found in Boot    
 Houses on both the{Saffron Lane}and   
{Braunstone Estates}(about 1500 homes).
 The cost of demolishing and rebuilding
 new homes was reported to be{Â£21,000  
 (Leicester Mercury, October 1984), but
 this seemed to be the only solution.  
      Demolition of the 1000 (approx.) 
 Boot homes on the{Saffron Lane Estate 
 began in{1985.}Working a{BLOCK}at a   
 time the occupiers are re-housed, the 
 homes{demolished}and{new houses built.
 The tennants can remain re-housed, or 
 have the new home on their old site.  </content>
