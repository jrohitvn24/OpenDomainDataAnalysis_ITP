		<title>07PRECIOUS METAL RECOVERY</title>
		<content> Of the new industries in the Tame     
 Valley, one of the most interesting of
 them demonstrates the rapidly changing
 nature of industry due to rapid       
 advances in technology.               
 N.E.C.P.(Reclamation) Ltd buys scrap  
 computers from all over the Continent 
 to extract the precious metals from   
 them. The computer parts are broken   
 into small pieces then pulverised.    
 Ferrous metal are removed by magnets  
 and the plastics by flotation. Gold,  
 silver and platignum are separated    
 using chemicals and ingots, worth at  
 present prices Â£15,000, are the end   
 product. Quite a change from the      
 factory's previous role as a 'Pickle  
 Works' producing many kinds of        
 preserved foods.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
