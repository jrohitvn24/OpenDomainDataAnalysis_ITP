		<content> There was a settlement from pagan     
 times and the Romans built a villa    
 here.That was discovered during pipe  
 laying in 1859 and more was exposed   
 while trench digging from Holly Hill  
 in 1876.The site was badly disturbed  
 but a scientific excavation in 1929   
 revealed part of a tessellated        
 pavement which is now in the church.  
 The Saxon Thane Torchil had a manor   
 which went to Count Alan in 1086,when 
 Bernulf was tenant.It was held by the 
 lords of Middleham &amp; in 1577 went to  
 the Cecil family then after some 60   
 years with the Milbanks was bought by 
 the family of the present owner.      
 The size of the village has not       
 altered very much although old        
 properties have been replaced by drier
 and more comfortable homes.Only one   
 shop is left out of several, no smithy
 and no mill.                          </content>
