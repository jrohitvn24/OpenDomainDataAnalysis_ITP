		<content> The assigned block covers an area     
 approximately six miles north-west of 
 Derby and six miles south-east of     
 Ashbourne in the county of Derbyshire.
 The area traverses the main A52 trunk 
 road between Derby and Buxton.The main
 centre of population is Brailsford    
 village where about 200 dwellings     
 house approx. 420 adults and 130      
 children of school age.The fact that  
 these figures are constantly changing 
 reflects the nature of the village.   
 What was once a place of distinct     
 rural character, where the main form  
 of employment was with local          
 landowners,is now more of a commuters 
 haven.This means that families rarely 
 settle in the area for any length of  
 time.Thus,the community life in the   
 village has changed to reflect the    
 needs of these families.
