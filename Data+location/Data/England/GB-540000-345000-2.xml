		<content> Our area is used as an overfly area to
 the range for the Royal Air Force,the 
 United States Air Force and NATO      
 forces and a testing ground for new   
 aircraft and pilots. They come from   
 local RAF bases at Coningsby,Scampton,
 Waddington and the USAAF base at      
 Mildenhall in Suffolk.During NATO     
 exercises aircraft also come from     
 France,Belgium and West Germany.The   
 aircraft are usually Phantoms,F-111's,
 Jaguars,Tornados and A-10's.          
 Occasionally the Battle of Britain    
 Memorial flight flies over here on its
 way to displays.Although the use of   
 the range  is necessary,people in the 
 area do not appreciate the noise of   
 the aircraft either during the day or 
 at night.A warning is usually given in
 the local newspaper and on the radio  
 if any major NATO exercise is to take 
 place involving low-flying aircraft.  </content>
