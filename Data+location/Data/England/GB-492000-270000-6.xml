		<title>06The Interior of the Church.</title>
		<content>    Some of the most interesting items 
in St. Peter's Church are the eight    
misericords or the monks' stalls.      
Beneath them, on the underside, can be 
seen the reason for their popularity   
with the older monks. They are the     
original stalls dating from the 14th   
century.                               
    There is a squint on the left hand 
wall in the Pyel Chapel, this was so   
that lepers and other unwelcome        
worshippers could obtain an excellent  
view of the altar through the squint   
during church services.                
     Restoration has been in progress  
in the church for several years. The   
crumbling stonework has been replaced  
and the rest cleaned, the roof has     
been completely replaced, using much   
of the old lead and the main beam above
the altar had to be renewed.
