		<content> Kosangas is in St.Sampsons. It        
 distributes L.P.G. throughout the     
 Channel Islands. Kosangas has been    
 there for twenty six years and now has
 an annual turnover of Â£2.9millon per  
 annum. The maximum people they employ 
 are fifteen at one time. They import  
 gas from Denmark and export it to all 
 the Channel Islands except Jethou. The
 business fills up all the gas         
 cylinders and pumps L.P.G. to Guernsey
 gas for conversion to town gas.They   
 also pressure test all cylinders and  
 completely overhaul them in line with 
 the relevant codes of practice. There 
 are three separate tanks and there are
 five tanks joined together and each of
 them have fire sprinklers. Recently   
 the Board of Administration have      
 suggested that the tanks should be    
 resited as they are a safety          
 hazard.LPG is Liquid Petroleum Gas.   </content>
