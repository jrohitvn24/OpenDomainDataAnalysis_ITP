		<title>13VISIT TO ROGER ASCHAM SCHOOL</title>
		<content> AT ROGER ASCHAM SCHOOL, WE SAW THE    
 HANDICAPPED CHILDREN.  I HELPED DAMIEN
 DO MATHS.  HE HAD TO MEASURE HIMSELF. 
 HE WANTED TO BE A FIREMAN AND SAVE    
 PEOPLE IN FIRES.  LAST WEEK IN        
 SWIMMING, DAMIEN SWAM A WIDTH, AND HIS
 MUM GAVE HIM A SILVER CUP WITH HIS    
 NAME ON THAT SHE HAD MADE.  THE       
 HANDICAPPED CHILDREN ARE VERY HAPPY,  
 AND USE SPECIAL TYPEWRITERS, AND STAND
 UP IN THESE THINGS STRAPPED TO THEIR  
 LEGS.  DAWN HAS THIS THING ON WHEELS, 
 WHICH, BY PRESSING A BUTTON, IT MOVES.
  NEAR THE  END, THEY PLAYED A SONG FOR
 US.  SARAH WAS ON THE RECORDER.  I    
 LEARNED ALOT ABOUT HANDICAPPED PEOPLE,
 AND WHAT THEY DO.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
