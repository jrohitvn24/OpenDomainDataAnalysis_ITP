 One of the occupations in this area is
 fencing.This is to keep the deer from 
 the young trees.                      
{Farming                               
 Most of the farms in this area are    
 small compact farms with not much     
 machinery and not many crops.In fact  
 most of the farms only have animals.  
{Forestry                              
 Most of the trees in our area are     
 pine.There are some other trees as    
 well such as oak, beech, elm,         
 sycamore, rowan and birch.            
{Building.                             
 Most buildings in our area are small  
 crofts except for a few estate houses 
 such as Edradynate, Derculich, and    
 Findynate. Most of these buildings    
 were built some time ago but many     
 local people were involved in work on 
 these estates and some still are.     </content>
