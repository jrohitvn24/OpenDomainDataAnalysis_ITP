		<title>05CARE &amp; PROBLEMS OF ELDERLY</title>
		<content> A nursing sister collaborates with    
 local doctors in the care of the      
 elderly. Treatment such as giving     
 injections and changing dressings is  
 carried out in the patient's home, and
 where necessary a nurse will help an  
 old age pensioner to bath. Some are   
 visited by a chiropodist at reduced   
 fees.In addition, meals on wheels are 
 available through the Social Services 
 to those living alone who cannot cook 
 well-balanced meals for themselves.   
 There is little public transport in   
 the area which can cause problems for 
 old people who are unable to drive.   
 They do not like to be dependant on   
 friends and neighbours to get to a    
 town or even local clubs &amp; functions. 
 As a result there is a tendency for   
 such people to leave this district for
 more transport or sheltered housing.
