		<title>13FAMOUS BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> Worksop boasts several buildings of   
 note. There is the Priory Church,     
 built in 1103 by the Normans. This    
 church has been added to in the       
 12th., 13th. and 20th. centuries.     
                                       
 Associated with the Priory is the Gate
 House which at one time used to have a
 road passing through it. This road was
 diverted in 1891 to preserve the      
 building.                             
                                       
 In the market place there is the Old  
 Ship Inn, one of Worksop's oldest     
 pubs. It is believed to have been     
 built in the 16th. or 17th. century.  
                                       
 At the top of Bridge Street is a      
 chemist which has a licence to sell   
 alcohol in its cellars.               
                                       
                                       </content>
