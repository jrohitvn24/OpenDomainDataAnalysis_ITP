		<title>09THE ANGEL,A VILLAGE PUB</title>
		<content>                                       
  The Angel is one of Sherston's pubs. 
 We spoke to Mr.Bell there.He told us  
 that the Angel was built in the{13th  
{century}but was burnt down in the     
{Great Fire of Sherston.}It was{rebuilt
{in 1648.}The Fire place in the Lounge 
 is original.There is a Main bar which 
 has some pool tables,Gambling machines
 a Juke box and some chairs and tables.
 In the lounge there is also a bar.This
 is a quiet place.There is a place     
 further out of the pub which is the   
 skittle Alley.This also has a bar.The 
 Angel got it's name because it used to
 be a place where people could stay and
 the cost of one night was an{Angel    
 which was{a coin.}The pub opens at    
 11.00am until 2.30pm and then opens   
 again at 6.00pm until 11.00pm.
