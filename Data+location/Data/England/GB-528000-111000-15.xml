		<title>15SOUTH DOWNS WAY</title>
		<content> The most famous bridleway in our block
 is the South Downs Way which runs from
 west to east across the top of the    
 Downs. We interviewed a local postman 
 and keen Sussex walker who gave us    
 information about the South Downs Way.
 It became a public right of way in    
 1949 because the National Parks       
 required the making of long routes.   
 Today the Local Highway Authority with
 the County Council looks after the    
 path although it is financed by the   
 Countryside Commission. The 8O-mile   
 way is one of the most famous and     
 interesting walks in the British      
 Isles. On most days especially summer 
 weekends, parents with children,      
 hikers and horse riders may be seen on
 the slopes of the Way enjoying the    
 magnificent views. Exploring open     
 country becomes more popular as road  
 congestion grows.                     </content>
