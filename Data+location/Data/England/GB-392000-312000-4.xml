		<title>04The Health Centre</title>
		<content>The Health Centre is not just a place  
for people to be treated for illnesses 
but is used as a meeting place for     
organizations such as the Red Cross and
St John's Ambulance.                   
The Red Cross meet on Wednesday        
evenings and they do work which        
involves a tremendous amount of things 
not just first aid but natural         
disasters as well.                     
The St John's Ambulance meet on Monday 
evenings and they do similar work to   
the Red Cross but cover a larger area  
in first aid. They attend fairs and    
other events to provide first aid if it
is needed.                             
There are four doctors and nurses and  
clerical staff who work together       
forming the Health Centre. It is open  
from 8.30 to 10 am  and from 5 to 6.30 
pm.
