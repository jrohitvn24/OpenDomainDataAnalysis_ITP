		<title>20SHEPPERTON STUDIOS</title>
		<content>  The first studios were built in      
 Littleton,near the embankment of The  
 Queen Mary reservoir in 1935.They were
 built on the site of an old mansion   
 house dating back from about 1100.    
 These studios became known as         
 Shepperton Studios and the buildings  
 gradually expanded then decreased as  
  did the popularity of the feature    
 film industry.                        
  Many firms associated with the film  
 world now occupy the site_these range 
 from electricians to carpenters,from  
 model makers to lighting engineers.   
  The average cost for making a feature
 film in 1985 is 15 million dollars.   
 Usually the producers chose one of 2  
 ways to spend the most of this money_ 
 they either use very realistic scenery
 or costumes,the second way is to      
 employ a famous actor or actress.
