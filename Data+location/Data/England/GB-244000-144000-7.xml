		<content>     Mortehoe consists of eleven farms 
 namely Shaftsboro, Borough, Damage,   
 Warcombe, Yarde, Easewell, North      
 Morte, Town, Poole, Ossaborough and   
 Willingcott.  Ranging from an acreage 
 of approximately sixty to two hundred 
 and fifty, not one of these has a herd
 of dairy cows today.                  
     The last one of seventy cows was  
 dispersed this year at Warcombe.  The 
 main source of income on farms today  
 is sheep, beef, tourism and barley in 
 that order.                           
     Machinery used for silage making  
 and combining is mostly supplied by   
 contractors from outside, for example 
 forage harvester and combine.         
     Ploughing, cultivating and        
 planting is done by the farmer        
 himself.  Farmers today employ very   
 few permanent workers.
