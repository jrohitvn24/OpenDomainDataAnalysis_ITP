		<content> About twice as many people have their 
 main meal in the evening as those     
 eating at mid-day during the week, but
 the picture is reversed on Sunday when
 only half the population eat a main   
 meal in the evening.                  
 25% of households in the village      
 regularly eat a vegetarian meal,      
 including 6 households who are mostly 
 vegetarian. On the other hand about   
 half the households never eat a       
 vegetarian meal. Rice and pasta based 
 meals are more popular, with 60% of   
 households enjoying such dishes       
 regularly or often, and with only 10% 
 never eating rice or pasta. Most      
 people eat both brown and white bread 
 but 10% eat only brown and 15% eat    
 only white  bread. More than 40% have 
 a take-away meal regularly or         
 sometimes, and over 60% eat out       
 regularly or sometimes.               </content>
