		<title>01LOW HESKET _ LAW AND ORDER</title>
		<content>   There have been many road accidents 
 as a result of the fast flowing and   
 often busy A6. The accidents include a
 man being killed just south of Low    
 Hesket as a result of a car going     
 underneath a lorry. Up on the fell,   
 just before Low Hesket, a motorbike   
 collided with a car. He was killed.   
   Any burgalries which have taken     
 place have been of a high class       
 nature. This is because alot of the   
 people have retired to Low Hesket and 
 have many valuables. The Police House 
 has been there for 40 years. An actual
 Policeman has been there since the    
 turn of the century. Today's Policeman
 has been there for 4 years. The pub   
 and the shop are the only buildings   
 which have an alarm. There is often   
 trouble at the pub and the trouble    
 makers are taken to Carlisle.
