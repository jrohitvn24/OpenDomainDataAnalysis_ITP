		<title>14PARISH COUNCIL IN MAWNAN</title>
		<content> Meetings are held monthly.There are 10
 Parish{Councillors}elected every 4    
 years.Four are Farmers.Three people   
 have moved in the last 15 years most  
 of the people are local.The Council   
 looks after fields,foot paths and     
 playing fields.They also pass opinions
 on planning applications.Recently they
 have been concerned about rebuilding  
 Durgan steps which have been eroded by
 the sea.They are concerned about      
 redecorating the Cricket Pavillion and
 fitting a Fire Extinguisher.It was    
 suggested that a new pavillion should 
 be built.The state of grass by the    
 school and play area is too long and  
 needs cutting more regularly than     
 once a year.It was suggested that the 
 chip van parked in a dangerous        
 position in the village centre and    
 should move to the hall.
