		<content> For the Infants at Stibbard Annexe    
 most work is aimed at enabling them to
 read, write, and begin to use and     
 understand numbers. Afternoons are    
 often given over to free play with    
 constructional toys, jigsaw puzzles,or
 the "home corner" in which a small    
 group plays at being a family, in a   
 space filled with small chairs, a     
 table, cooking utensils, and other    
 household effects.                    
 The Junior timetable at Ryburgh is    
 more formal and includes English      
 (Reading, Writing, Drama, and Language
 Construction), Mathematics, Science,  
 Religion,Art &amp; Craft(Painting,Drawing,
 Modelling etc). History and Geography 
 are usually treated as overlapping    
 'topics' of which "The Sea" or        
 "Castles" are two examples. Physical  
 Education includes gymnastics,        
 football, hockey and netball.         </content>
