		<title>11Hillfarrance Church</title>
		<content>   Hillfarrance is listed in the       
 original Domesday Survey as Hilla.    
 Later the name of the Ferun family was
 added and Hulle-Ferun eventually      
 became Hillfarrance.                  
   The Church of the Holy Cross        
 occupies a central position by the    
 village green.  It is a small, simple,
 building, at least seven hundred years
 old, which consists of a nave,        
 chancel, porch, chapel on the south   
 side and a tower at the west end.  The
 tower was built following a bequest   
 made by a certain John Peryn of       
 Wellington in his will dated 1509.  It
 houses a peal of six bells which are  
 still rung.                           
   Although the interior appears plain,
 with only clear glass windows, it has 
 an elaborately carved pew ends, each  
 with an original and different design.
