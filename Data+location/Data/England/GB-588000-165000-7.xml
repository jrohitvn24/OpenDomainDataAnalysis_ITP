		<content> The region is crossed by the A249     
 trunk road which links the M2 motorway
 with Sheerness Docks. In the last     
 twelve years the Docks have grown     
 rapidly and whilst some of the freight
 goes by rail most seems to be carted  
 by lorry. Recent surveys by the       
 children of Iwade have shown at peak  
 times that well over 2000 vehicles an 
 hour use the road of which 25% are    
 heavy lorries. The A249 is not        
 adequate to cope with this volume of  
 traffic. An Iwade by-pass is planned  
 to be built and it is hoped that the  
 village will be told the route in the 
 late summer of 1985. A B2005 road     
 links Sittingbourne with the A249 and 
 passes through Grovehurst. This road  
 too is very busy and between          
 Grovehurst and Iwade ther is no       
 pavement. A large investment program  
 is needed to improve the area roads.  </content>
