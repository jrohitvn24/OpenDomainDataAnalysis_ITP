		<title>07SCHOOL DINNERS</title>
		<content>      A school meal costs 60 pence for 
 one day. If the parents of a child are
 unemployed then the meal is provided  
 free. In our school 145 out of 178    
 children stay for dinner.             
      When it is time for dinner, first
 we wash our hands and say our prayers 
 and wait for the dinner supervisors to
 give out the cutlery which is made    
 from stainless steel. We then walk to 
 the kitchen hatch and collect our food
 on a plate made from pottery.         
      The menu for the week beginning  
 1st July 1985 was:{Monday}Potato, stew
 carrots, jelly and biscuit.{Tuesday   
 Yorkshire pudding, sausage, cabbage,  
 jam tart and custard.{Wednesday}mutton
 and potato pastie, carrots, yogurt.   
{Thursday}Fish cakes, tomatoes, beans, 
 potatoes, ginger sponge and white     
 sauce.{Friday}Roast pork, carrots,    
 cauliflower, apple crumble, custard.  </content>
