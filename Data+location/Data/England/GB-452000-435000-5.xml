 Horticultural Station is a government 
 funded experimental farm carrying out 
 basic research into crops for         
 commercial development. It covers 150 
 acres of fine light sandy soil and    
 employs 40 people.It is situated on   
 flat open land but an important       
 feature of the site is a shelter belt,
 planted by, a former director,        
 consisting of Leylandii, deciduous    
 trees, and a beech hedge. Crops are   
 grown under glass and polythene as    
 well as outdoors. Glasshouse crops    
 include tomatoes, cucumber and        
 lettuce. Other crops are soft fruits, 
 rhubarb,cabbage,corn,calabrese,rape,  
 potatoes, and red beet. Crops are     
 generally marketed on the open market.
 Development has remained static of    
 late and the future depends on the    
 availabilty of government funding.    </content>
