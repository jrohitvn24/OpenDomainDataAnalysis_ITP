		<title>13St.Ediths Church,Monks Kirby</title>
		<content> Monks came to Monks Kirby in 1077.    
 They were Benedictine Monks and came  
 from a monastery in Anjou which is in 
 France.They came at the invitation of{
{Geoffrey de la Guerche.}He was given a
 great deal of land by William the     
 Conqueror.There is an old statue of   
 Guerche in the church which the monks 
 were responsible for building.There is
 a nave a chancel and a north and south
 aisle.Above the main entrance is      
 a priest room.In the north chapel are 
 two tombs.They are of the Fielding    
 family.The tower which is built into  
 the southwest corner was at one time a
 tall octagonal tower and in the 14th. 
 century was shortened by 20 feet as a 
 precaution against being blown down.  
 Inspite of this the tower was blown   
 down On Christmas day 1701.The repair 
 can easily be seen because it was done
 in a lighter coloured ashlar stone.   </content>
