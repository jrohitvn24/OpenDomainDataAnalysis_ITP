 to mental health.                     
               The patients can get up 
 almost when they want as they can get 
 breakfast until 8.45 am. After        
 breakfast there are many activities   
 for the patients. Some of these such  
 as housework and selfcare are helpful 
 for rehabilitation but some are       
 hobbies such as snooker, darts and    
 painting.                             
   Lunch is served between 12 and 1 pm.
 Activities are carried on in the      
 afternoon until dinner between 6 and  
 6.45 pm. There is no fixed bedtime and
 patients can watch late T.V. The 80

 are often arranged and contact with
