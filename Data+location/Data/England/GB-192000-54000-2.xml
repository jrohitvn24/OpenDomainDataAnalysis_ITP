		<title>02Landscape Around Treviscoe</title>
		<content> The unique appearance of the area     
 which is often described as{"lunar    
{landscape"}is caused by the enormous  
 upheavals of the clay industry. It has
 been given the name{"Cornish Alps". } 
 The clay itself is obtained from areas
 of old and "decaying" granite. Maps of
 the area soon become outdated as      
 houses and roads are buried and new   
 routes created to replace them. Modern
 workings create enormous white tips,  
 cavernous pits and large white mica   
 lagoons. In contrast the older        
 workings are covered in the green of  
 gorse and rough grass. Steep sided    
 pits are filled with deep green water.
 There are many old pump houses. When  
 not covered by mist, glimpses of the  
 sea can be obtained from various      
 vantage points.Southwards stretch     
 rolling hills of farmland.Farms in the
 area are predominately of grassland.  </content>
