		<title>09    Mells  Park</title>
		<content>     When we got to{Mells park}we went 
 up to the house and met the secretary 
 who took us to see the estate manager.
 He took us round to the front of the  
 house and told us that across the     
 ha-ha is {temple gardens }where there 
 used to be a deer enclosure. Ian said 
 "Who was{Little Jack Horner?"}and the 
 estate manager said that there was a  
 knight called Sir Jack Horner who     
 owned the estate once long ago and    
 perhaps the rhyme refers to him.      
     The estate has got 1200 acres.Most
 of this land is rented by farmers.The 
 present house was built on the site of
 an earlier house which was destroyed  
 by a terrible fire but there has been 
 some sort of dwelling here since      
 Norman times.The estate is now owned  
 by an international mining company    
 who are restoring the house and using 
 it as a conference centre.            </content>
