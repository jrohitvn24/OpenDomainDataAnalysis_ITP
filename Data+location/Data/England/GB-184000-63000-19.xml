 said that most postings lasted for    
 three years.There were a lot of clubs 
 to join in your spare time and whether
 you lived on or off the base St Mawgan
 was popular because of its pleasent   
 surroundings.The Americans on the base
 tended not to mix with the British.   
   In the control tower the radar room 
 was lit with a blue light.Dave        
 Kartmell showed us round and then he  
                                       
 took us up to the control tower.the   
 entire D.block could be seen from     
 here.                                 
   Sergeant Mace was bring in a        
 helicopter to land.They use bird      
 scarers to keep birds off the runway  
 which is twice the normal with.G.P.O.

 11.25 sq.km. of ground.               </content>
