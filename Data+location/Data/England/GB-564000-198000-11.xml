		<content> After the parish council the next tier
 of local government is the district   
 council. Ingatestone forms part of    
 Brentwood District Council while the  
 area to the west of the River Wid lies
 within the area of Chelmsford District
 Council.                              
 Electorally Ingatestone is a ward of  
 Brentwood District and returns three  
 elected district councillors. Each    
 councillor holds his/her seat for four
 years hence there is a district       
 council election three out of every   
 four years. There is no district      
 council election in the year when     
 County Council elections take place.  
 In 1985 two of the councillors are    
 Conservative (with majorities of less 
 than 100) and the third a Liberal with
 a majority of less than 200. Labour   
 candidates generally come a poor third
 in elections in this well-off area.   </content>
