		<title>10The Cannington Policeman</title>
		<content> Our local community policeman is P.C  
 Locke. He visited our school to run   
 a course of cycling proficiency.      
 While he was here,our class           
 interviewed him.                      
 He said that he had been a policeman  
 for 20 years and worked a 40 hour     
 week.During that time the policemen   
 check property at night, and during   
 the day they go to the scenes of      
 crimes and accidents.Also they visit  
 schools and other people.P.C Locke's  
 area covers Combwich,Cannington,      
 Stolford,Otterhampton and Hinkley     
 Point.In that area the most common    
 crime is "Petty Theft".               
 To join the police_force you          
 have to apply to the police H.Q in    
 Bristol.If accepted training takes 2  
 years. During that time students do   
 sport ,learn about the law and dealing
 with people.                          </content>
