		<title>04Housing - A typical cottage</title>
		<content>In comparison with the extensive Deene 
Hall and the housing facilities of the 
farms, visits to other homes offered a 
stark contrast...with cottages being   
compact, having tiny rooms and low     
ceilings.                              
A typical example was Â£Rose Cottage',  
in Deene...part of which was once the  
village bakery. Originally a semi-     
detached property the house has been   
converted into a single home, but      
even now it is small compared with     
modern homes. The tiny rooms had low   
doors, large fireplaces, uneven floors,
small windows and ceilings just above  
head height.                           
In the scullery there were still signs 
of the baker's oven...and walls of     
painted stone. The bedrooms were at    
the top of steep stairs, leading up at 
the side of the living room.
