		<content>   There are various shops in          
 Northleach situated around the square.
 There are shops for the housewife but 
 not many for the younger generation   
 and tourists. They are open from      
 Monday to Saturday, but Thursday is   
 half_day closing. Recently a bypass   
 has been constructed to prevent heavy 
 traffic through the town.A few        
 shopkeepers' trade has been badly     
 affected. An average packet of        
 cigarettes costs 1.15, bread costs   
 46p a sliced loaf, 1/2 pound of cheese
 costs 70p, lard 36p and a good bottle 
 of whisky costs 7.99.                
   There are about 11 shops including a
 post office, two butchers, a few      
 hardware shops , a pharmacy which     
 sells a few novelties.                
 Thursdays,Fridays and Saturdays are   
 the busiest days in Northleach. A few 
 shops are open on Sunday mornings.    </content>
