{Arts and Crafts. }The font is perhaps 
 the church's greatest treasure.It is  
 thought to have been given by Richard 
 1 to the Abbot Robert for his safe    
 return from captivety.Amongst the fine
 stained glass windows is one by  Kempe
 and the bird windows are 15th century 
 and unique.                           
  {Population}This Parish church owes  
 its size to the fact that the area it 
 _originally served was much larger    
 than                                  
 now and it was built at the hub of the
 district.However,since the            
 Reformation,the main population has   
 centred around Robertsbridge.         
  {Tourism}Tourists visit the church   
 throughout the year.The money they    
 donate is needed to help pay for the  
 general upkeep.The economical problem 
 is always of concern.                 </content>
