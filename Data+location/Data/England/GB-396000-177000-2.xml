		<title>02PARADISE FARM</title>
		<content> Our class went for a visit to Katie   
 Potter's farm.We all went in cars.When
 we got there Mr. Potter was loading up
 two lorries with his grain.It was     
 going to the docks and it might go to 
 Ethiopia.He had a huge pile of grain  
 about 300 tons all in one of his      
 barns.We were allowed to play on the  
 tractors_one was a John Deere.We sat  
 in agreat big combine harvester and   
 played with all the controls.Mrs.     
 Potter showed us the cows.She had 70  
 cows, some were brown and some were   
 black.I liked seeing their            
 tongues.We saw some sheep but when we 
 got close to them they all ran away   
 and Katie chased them down the field.
