		<title>10LIFE IN BARSBY</title>
		<content>  The 1701 spring well farm is the     
 oldest building in Barsby. The first  
 brick house, built with two inch      
 bricks, was built in 1707. These      
 bricks  were all hand made. For many  
 years sewage and waste water were     
 allowed to drain along open dykes     
 through the fields. The deepest well  
 in Barsby was 35 feet deep. The most  
 influential event in Barsby was  the  
 mechamisation of farm machinery at the
 end of the 19th century. This saw the 
 beginning of a change in the style of 
 local farming. Many of the small farms
 were bought out by the few wealthy    
 farmers, creating large prosperous    
 farms. field hedges  and walls were   
 pulled down to form large fields in   
 which it was easier and more efficient
 for the use of machinery.
