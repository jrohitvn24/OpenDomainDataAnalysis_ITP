		<content> At{Castle Folds Farm}there are{24     
{Friesian cows}one of which can cost{  
{Â£500 to Â£600.}Ever since he left      
 school the farmer has milked cows,at  
 first by hand but now by machine.He   
 has six stands in his milking parlour 
 and each cow takes about three minutes
 to be milked.A cow can give on average
{four gallons}of milk each day but when
 newly calved it could give{eight.}All 
 his milk goes to Northern Dairies     
 where it is processed.The farmer is   
 paid{14.5p per litre}the retailer     
 sells it at{23p per pint.}There is no 
 bull at the farm, they use artificial 
 insemination.At the end of this year  
 the farmer is going out of dairy      
 farming and into beef because the Milk
 Marketing Board has fixed a quota for 
 all dairy farmers and this farmer said
 it wasn't enough to make a profit.
