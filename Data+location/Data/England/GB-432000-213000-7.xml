Brizes Lodge is on the edge of the     
ancient Wychwood forest. The Lodge is  
400 years old and Roman objects have   
been found there. It was surrounded by 
forest until 1863 when the land was    
cleared and the farm was built. Today  
deer sometimes jump over fences and    
damage the crops and trees.            
                                       
Brizes Lodge is a mixed family farm.   
Mr.Cashman is the tenant who rents the 
farm from Cornbury estate. Crop        
including oats, wheat, barley and      
beans for cattle and pigeon feed are   
grown in the fieds. Amongst the crop   
sprayer can not reach. Some land is    
used for grazing sheep or cows.
