    The location of the council housing
 estate that we were studying was east 
 of the Forest School.The estate is    
 located here because of good          
 communications and practical amenities
 i.e. shops,schools,churches,public    
 houses and petrol stations.On the     
 estate there are thirty-five          
 semi-detached houses thirteen built in
 1941 and twenty-two in 1976.These     
 houses are ocupied mainly by manual   
 labourers.These houses are made up of 
 six rooms,three bedrooms,one bathroom 
 a dining room/living room and a       
 kitchen.                              
    On average the families on the     
 estate are oversized.                 </content>
