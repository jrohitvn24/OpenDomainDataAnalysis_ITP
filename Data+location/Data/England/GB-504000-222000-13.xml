{Leighton Buzzard}and all the other    
 small villages. This is mainly known  
 as South Bedfordshire. The hospital   
 can have up to 750 patients but this  
 ammount varies as sometimes parts of  
 the building are closed for           
 decoration.In the hospital there are  
 many different departments. Some of   
 the most important are intensive      
 care,ENT,gynaecology and the{accident 
{service.}The hospital has 2150 staff  
 with 70 junior doctors and 61         
 consultants. The hospital was actually
 built in 1939 but other parts have    
 been added such as the Children's     
 block, built in 1983. The area which  
 the hospital covers is no less than 13
 hectares.
