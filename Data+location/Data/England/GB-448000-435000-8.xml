		<title>08THE CHURCH AT CHURCH FENTON</title>
		<content>   The church is 750 years old.It is   
 shaped like Jesus' cross with the     
 tower in the middle.This{cruciform    
{structure}is rare in this area and the
 tower is very large for such a small  
 church.The tower was built in 1450.It 
 is supported by four stone pillars and
 inside one is a stone spiral          
 staircase leading to the belfry.In the
 belfry are{three bells;}one strikes   
 every half hour.In each corner of the 
 tower there is a red light to warn low
 flying aeroplanes.These are needed    
 because there is an RAF base          
 nearby.The south wall is moving       
 outwards and repairs are needed.The   
 church is built of{limestone.}The roof
 is slate but the tower roof is made of
 lead and straw.There is no vandalism  
 so the church is left open.
