		<title>01INTRODUCING STOURBRIDGE</title>
		<content>   {Stourbridge}is in the south west   
 corner of the Metropolitan Borough of 
 Dudley,and the most south westerly    
 point of the West Midlands            
 conurbation.It represents the{service}
 centre for the districts of Pedmore,  
 Lye,Amblecote and Wollaston and as a  
{commuter}zone to the centres of       
 Birmingham and Wolverhampton.         
    Traditional industries such as     
 chain and nail making,the wool trade  
 and other manufacturing industries    
 developed and were aided by the       
 availability of raw materials.The     
 establishment of canals and railways  
 allowed accessibility to markets      
 elsewhere for the end products.       
    Today new{industry}has             
 developed along the valley of the     
 River Stour outside the central       
 business district which is confined by
 the ring road.                        </content>
