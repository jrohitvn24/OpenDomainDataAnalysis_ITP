		<title>16THE STONE BRIDGE</title>
		<content>     The agreement to build the bridge 
 over the River Eden was settled on    
 July 29th 1831. The price agreed was  
 Â£700 and the stone was supplied by the
 Great Stonebridge Trust. Following    
 completion one year later there was   
 trouble over payment bit it was       
 eventually paid.                      
     A sundial was also constructed on 
 the bridge but was demolished in 1834,
 only to be restored in 1902 to        
 commemorate the coronation of King    
 Edward VII. A plaque on the bridge    
 states, "The sundial was restored in  
 commemoration of his most Gracious    
 Majesty King Edward VII and of the    
 festivity held in the town in         
 connection with this on August the 9th
 1902." The story of the sundial was   
 abruptly ended when it was stolen in  
 1960....by Lee Scott and Simon Newman.
