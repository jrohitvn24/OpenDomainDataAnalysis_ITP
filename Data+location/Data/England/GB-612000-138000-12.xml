		<content> THE DRUM INN in the north of Stanford 
                                       
 on Stone Street was one of the Duke of
 Wellington's recruiting bases during  
 the Peninsula War. Farm lads would    
 swear "on the drum" their oath to the 
 monarch and take the King's Shilling. 
 BLIND HOUSE, beside Blind Lane, which 
 ran through Hayton Wood across Stone  
 Street to Shrine Farm and beyond,     
 before coming to a blind end.This lane
 has disappeared but given its house   
 name to the road leading up to Stone  
 Street at Gun Carriage corner. Blind  
 House Lane being the link between Swan
 Lane and Stone Street.
