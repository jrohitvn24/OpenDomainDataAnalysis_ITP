		<title>02UPHAM PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>    Upham Church has changed a lot over
 the years. It used to have thatch on  
 the roof but now it has slate. In 1598
 the church was made up of a squat     
 tower, nave, chancel and south aisle. 
 There were galleries and some wooden  
 panelling. The bell tower was built in
 the 18th century.                     
    Oliver Cromwell is reputed to have 
 stabled his horses in the church!     
 These days sheep graze amongst the    
 graves, some of which date from 1800. 
    From 1304 to 1814 and 1954 to 1978 
 the two parishes of Durley and Upham  
 were served by one Rector. However, in
 1978, due to the enforced early       
 retirement through sickness of the    
 Reverend Dick Catley, the link was    
 finally broken and Upham became joined
 to the parish of Bishops Waltham.     
    In 1981 the church was visited by  
 Lady Diana and Prince Charles.        </content>
