		<content> THE MANAGER OF{ALCAN}HAS SENT A LETTER
 TO OUR HEADMASTER TO WARN THE CHILDREN
 OF NEWBIGGIN'S MOORSIDE FIRST SCHOOL  
 NOT TO GO NEAR AND NOT TO PLAY NEAR   
 THE LAGOONS ,THE PEOPLE AT ALCAN CALL 
 THEM SETTLING PONDS.SOME CHILDREN HAVE
 BEEN REALLY STUPID USING THE LAGOONS  
 AS PADDLING POOLS. IT IS VERY         
 DANGEROUS TO PLAY ON THE LAGOONS      
 BECAUSE IF YOU SINK TROUGH THE CRUST  
 OF THE LAGOONS YOU WILL SINK 25FT AND 
 THE CHANCE OF GETTING YOU OUT IS NIL. 
 PEOPLE WANT TO BREAK THROUGH THE FENCE
 TO GET TO THE LAGOONS,THEY DO NOT TAKE
 ANY NOTICE OF THE DANGER SIGNS.THEY   
 BREAK UP THE SIGNS AND STEAL THE LIFE 
 JACKETS THAT ARE PUT THERE FOR        
 ADDITIONAL SAFETY. THE LAGOONS CONTAIN
 WASTE ASH LEFT AFTER THE{ALUMINIUM}HAS
 BEEN SMELTED.
