    The farmland in the area is mainly 
 arable, but there is also some grazing
 land. There is also some mixed        
 woodland.                             
    Some of the farms are owned by the 
 farmer, some are rented and some land 
 is farmed by people living out of the 
 area. The type of farms include mixed 
 farming,fat-stock,cross-breeds, sheep 
 and dairy farms.                      
    In the squares, grid reference

 cases are still in the ownership of   
 the original purchasers.
