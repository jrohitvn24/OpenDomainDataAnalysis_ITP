 The prominent feature of this block is
 the River Walkham which runs from N to
 S. It is flanked principally by open  
 moorland, with a few fields used for  
 grazing and hay. The moors have       
 several outcrops of granite (tors)    
 surrounded by clitter. Other than     
 agriculture, there is no industry     
 except numerous sites of derelict     
 quarries and tin mining. There is one 
 small village, Sampford Spiney, and   
 all lies within the Dartmoor National 
 Park. There are no roads of any       
 consequence although the N boundary of
 the block is adjacent to the Tavistock
 - Princetown road which provides      
 access for considerable numbers of    
 tourists in the summer, this being one
 of only two roads across Dartmoor.
