		<content>    This land of rocky hills has given 
 abundantly of its riches since the    
 Romans worked them for lead and now   
 they are quarried for their           
 sandstone.Many of the farmhouses and  
 houses are built of the local stone   
 and all are well maintained. There are
 several pre-1939 council houses made  
 of brick. Many farms have had         
 bungalows built next to them for the  
 farmers use.Is this the modern trend  
 we wonder? Many new properties have   
 been built of reconstituted stone most
 of which were owner occupied and all  
 were well maintained. A number of     
 professional people from nearby towns 
 have settled in the area preferring a 
 rural environment.
