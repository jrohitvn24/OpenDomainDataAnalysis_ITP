		<content>   With a fast growth in population    
 over the past 15 years, most of the   
 housing is relatively new.            
   Ugglebarnby is a very old village   
 with some new buildings, mostly       
 bungalows.  It is linear and          
 surrounded by scattered farms.        
   Sleights originally developed along 
 the old toll road and the present day 
 B1410.  Housing then developed on the 
 western slope of Iburndale.           
   Within Sleights, is council housing 
 some of these homes being built after 
 1945.  The other council houses are   
 recent (around 1970).  Off the A169   
 are a number of small private estates 
 built over the last 10 years, even    
 more recently, further housing estates
 have been developed.  There are also a
 number of council owned OAP bungalows.
  The rest of the housing in the area  
 are scattered farms and cottages.     </content>
