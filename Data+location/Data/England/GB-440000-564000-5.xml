		<content> RIDING SCHOOL.                        
 Mr and Mrs Tuck have kept the North   
 Lizard Riding School for 11 years.    
 It has been a riding school for at    
 least 40 years and was originally used
 for barning N.C.B. pit ponies. The    
 Tucks have 32 horses ( 16 liveried )  
 of 9 different breeds including 4 pure
 bred fell ponies. An hour lesson costs
 Â£3.50 or Â£3.00 if booked in advance.  
 The Tucks employ  2 full time staff   
 and several voluntary helpers. Their  
 licence must be renewed every year    
 following inspections by the          
 environmental officer and the vet.    
 Although there are not so many riders 
 in winter,the staff have more work to 
 do.Horses are kept inside at night,   
 fed,watered and taken out to the      
 field.In summer,horses are kept in the
 field but must be regularly checked.
