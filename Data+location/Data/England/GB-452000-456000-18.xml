		<title>18     Changes in Shipton</title>
		<content> The main change in Shipton is on the  
 A19 50 years ago 1 vehicle would pass 
 by about every 2 hours but now 9      
 vehicles pass every minute.Older      
 people have told us that they could   
 play on the road.We wouldn't now      
 because its to dangerous.Activites for
 children have changed,there was more  
 sport in the village and people played
 with the whip &amp; top.One farmer told us
 that he used to go pole volting over  
 the land around Shipton.We can't do   
 that now because there are crops in   
 the fields.We interviewed Mrs Holiday 
 who has lived in Shipton for 68 years 
 she came in 1917 she told us about    
 house work and washing day they washed
 in a wash house with a copper which   
 held rain water and a fire underneath 
 to heat the water.They had 2 peggy    
 tubs 1 peggy stick and a wringing     
 machine soap powder is alot different.</content>
