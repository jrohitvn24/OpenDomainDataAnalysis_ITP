		<content> There has been a church here since    
 Saxon times.                          
 In 1182 Abbot Samson(St.Edmondsbury   
 Abbey) went to Rome to ask Alexander  
 III to restore the church to the      
 abbey.He must have been successful    
 because in 1183 he appointed the      
 brother of his companion to Italy as  
 the Vicar of the church at "Wlpet".   
 In the 15th.Century the shrine        
 of "Our Lady of Wulpit" was visited by
 pilgrims from all over the country.   
 Queen Elizabeth I.is supposed to have 
 visited the church and given the      
 lectern.                              
 In 1702 the spire was blown down in a 
 gale and rebuilt in 1708 but was      
 struck by lightening and destroyed    
 again in 1852.During the              
 reconstruction Norman remains were    
 found.                                
                                       </content>
