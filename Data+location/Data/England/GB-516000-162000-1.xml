		<title>01CHESSINGTON:TOWN OR COUNTRY?</title>
		<content>   On the very edge of built_up Greater
 London,{CHESSINGTON}has something of a
 split personality; the area has easy  
 access to the metropolis (the A3 cuts 
 through our section, &amp; the{MOTSPUR    
{PARK BRANCHLINE}is the newest{BR}line 
 in the national network) _ yet rural  
 life is still a feature of modern     
 Chessington.                          
   Until the 1930's, there was little  
 in the neighbourhood beyond a remote  
 village{(pop.150,1821 Census)}and a   
 few outlying farms.  Much of this     
 aspect of Chessington remains, espe-  
 cially in the south of our section.   
   The enormous building programme     
 which transformed N.Surrey between the
 wars saw massive development around   
 here, with many families moving out   
 from inner_city homes.{URBAN SPREAD}  
 has now engulfed Hook &amp; N.Chessington,
 making it contiguous with the capital.</content>
