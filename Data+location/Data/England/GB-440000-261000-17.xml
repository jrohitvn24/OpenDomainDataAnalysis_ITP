		<content>  Southam Fire Brigade was established 
 in 1812 and is still in service today 
 based on the Coventry Road. A family  
 tradition which dates back a hundred  
 years is currently being upheld.      
 Members of the Burnell family have    
 been serving firemen since 1883 with  
 only one break in the tradition in    
 1969. With younger members of the     
 family eager to carry on, the         
 tradition seems set to last.          
  The fire station is manned by mainly 
 part-time firemen who carry a bleeper 
 with them as they go about their      
 normal work. The bleeper warns them of
 any emergency calls. Calls are relayed
 by teleprinter from Leamington.       
  Each fireman must attend courses and 
 training sessions on Thursday evening.
 The biggest worry facing the firemen  
 today is the number of road accidents 
 involving dangerous chemicals.        </content>
