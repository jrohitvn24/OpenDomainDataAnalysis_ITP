		<content> The area, which is divided across the 
 North East corner by the River        
 Severn, consists primarily of arable  
 farmland. 300 acres is being quarried 
 for sand and gravel. There are two    
 main roads through Holt Parish, one of
 which crosses the River Severn at Holt
 Fleet, and the two form a cross-roads 
 at Holt Heath. It is important to note
 that the 1828 bridge  designed by     
 Thomas Telford is the only point of   
 access across the river between       
 Stourport and Worcester. The Wychavon 
 Way, a recreational footpath, starts  
 at Holt Fleet Bridge. Holt Castle and 
 Church are historically the most      
 interesting buildings.
