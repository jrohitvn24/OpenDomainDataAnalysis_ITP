		<title>06Recreation Excluding Sport</title>
		<content> Walken &amp; Ardely offer a surprising    
 wide range of recreational facilities.
 Excluding sport, these include a      
 mother &amp; toddler group, playgroup,    
 scouts &amp; brownies, 2 branches of WIs, 
 the Walkern Friendly Club, Over 60's  
 Club in both villages, a gardening    
 club, art class, &amp; Young Farmers, who 
 meet in a 'hut' in Clay End. A number 
 of events e.g. Mayday celebrations,   
 exhibitions, Christmas entertainment, 
 raffles etc are assosicated with the  
 schools, pubs or churches. Most of    
 these activities take place in the 2  
 village halls or in the Walkern Sports
 &amp; Recreation Club. However it remains 
 likely that after television the main 
 leisure pursuit is visiting one of the
 4 public houses. Many people,         
 particularly the younger generation,  
 look outside the area, mostly to      
 Stevenage, for recreational activities</content>
