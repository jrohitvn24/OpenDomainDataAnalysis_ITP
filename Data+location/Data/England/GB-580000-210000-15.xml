		<content> There is a number of fine, old houses,
 originally surrounded by estates and  
 farms. Wickham Place was built in the 
 early 18th. century. A wing was added 
 during the 19th. century. The 50 acre 
 estate is slightly smaller than       
 originally. The family rents out      
 fields, but does not farm directly.   
 Cricket bats used to be made from     
 willows on the estate. The river runs 
 nearby, and fishing is private.       
 Wickham Hall is a large farm-house    
 with a 380 acre farm. The Hall was    
 built in the early 1700's on the site 
 of the residence of the Bishop of     
 London. It was later bought by the    
 ancestors of the present owners. It   
 has a large garden, with rare flowers 
 and trees. The moat is filled from an 
 underground spring. A boat-house      
 nearby has very old stained glass     
 windows.                              </content>
