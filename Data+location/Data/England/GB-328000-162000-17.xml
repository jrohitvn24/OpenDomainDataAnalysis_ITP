		<content>   Anchor Head is a rocky beach, it's a
 quite a big place. There are a lot of 
 hotels like Anchor Head Hotel and     
 Daunceys.                             
   About a hundred years ago the area  
 was rented to Edward Baesh of         
 Stanstead for 4d a year.              
   An improvement scheme was started in
 in 1883 which included the            
 construction of new walls from Anchor 
 Head to the sanatorium.The dunes to   
 south of the town were removed and    
 some lawns were added and a boating   
 slip. Other work included new carriage
 drives and a promenade together with  
 shelters, public conveniences and     
 fencing. The whole work cost about    
 Â£35,000 more than Â£2 per head of      
 population.                           
   Today Anchor Head is a popular place
 for tourists to sit in the sun.       
 Westoners like to go crabbing there.  </content>
