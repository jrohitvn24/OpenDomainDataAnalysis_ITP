 On my way to school I see many people.
 Half of my journey is along a peaceful
 country road, while the remainder is  
 along a busy dual-carriageway,the     
 A 217.                                
 At school it is always the same       
 routine: 2 lessons, break, 3rd        
 lesson, lunch,4th lesson and finally  
 de-registration. Then once again I    
 take my journey back home.            
 When I arrive home,I start my         
 homework. This can sometimes take up  
 to one and a half hours. After my     
 homework I get changed and go out for 
 a while. I usually practise golf, but 
 occasionally play football.           
 At around nine o'clock I come in and  
 at around ten o'clock I go to bed.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
