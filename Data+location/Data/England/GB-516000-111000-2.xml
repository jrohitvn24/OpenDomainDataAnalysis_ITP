		<title>02Farming In The Steyning Area</title>
		<content> Our area is a mixed farming area      
 because some of it is brookland which 
 is useless to farmers because it is so
 wet,some of the land is very chalky.  
 The land is graded,the best in our    
 area is grade 2.One of the most common
 crops is oil seed rape which is used  
 to make margarine.Other common crops  
 are wheat,barley and oats.The main    
 farms in our area are{Kingsbarn Farm  
 which is very near a river so it is   
 mainly brookland.It is a beef farm.   
{Huddlestone Farm}which has 120 dairy  
 cows and a few fields of crops.       
{Wyckham Dale Farm}which is a dairy    
 farm.{Nash Farm}which is not really a 
 farm but a hotel with a vineyard and  
{Wappingthorn Farm}which is mainly     
 dairy cows with a few crops.There is  
 also a{Poultry Farm}and the{Wiston    
{Estates}on which are mixed farming    
 areas.                                </content>
