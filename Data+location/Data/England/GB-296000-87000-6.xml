		<content> On Topsham Quay there is a boatyard   
 owned and run by the Trout family who 
 have lived in Topsham for many years. 
 Mr. Trout makes wooden boats in the   
 traditional way and he also makes     
 small wooden models of the boats he   
 has made. The latest boat to be made  
 was a sailing dinghy which was lifted 
 into the water with the help of a     
 crane.                                
 A little way along the quay you can   
 find Mr. Pym with his ferry. It is a  
 small motor boat which takes people   
 across the river, mainly for fishing. 
                                       
 Another feature of the quayside is the
 Topsham Mud, a stretch of soft slimy  
 mud which is used for playing 'mud    
 football' during the Topsham Town     
 Fayre celebrations. This is a very    
 messy but popular game.
