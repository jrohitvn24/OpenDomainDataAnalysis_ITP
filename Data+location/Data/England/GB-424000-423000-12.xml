		<title>12The Mosque</title>
		<content>  The Mosque I am talking about is half
 a mile away from the town centre and  
 is in Snowden Street.It was built in  
 January 1983 and has only one floor.  
 There are five rooms.One for the      
 toilets,one for keeping holy books in,
 one for keeping ladders etc. and one  
 where we worship.                     
  We have,five times a day Namaz       
 (worship).There is something like an  
 exam every year.Everyone gets a       
 prize.Our holy book is called Quran   
 and it is written in Arabic which we  
 read.Children come to pray.They pray  
 between 5 p.m. until 7 p.m. and there 
 are four classes and on Saturday's    
 they come from 9 a.m. until 11 a.m.   
 They do not go to Mosques on Sunday's.
  30% of Batley's population are       
 Muslims.There are three Mosques in the
 town altogether.                      
                                       </content>
