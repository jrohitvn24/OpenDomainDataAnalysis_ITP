 is a popular place for many visitors  
 to Abberley,not just because of its

 The strong gales in 1849 caused so    
 much damage to the old spire of       
 St.Michael's church that a new site   
 was chosen and a new church built.    
 The site was given by Mr.Moilliet.The 
 foundation stone was laid in 1850.In  
 1852 it was consecrated by the Bishop 
 of Hereford.The church was built in   
 the Early English style.In 1873 a fire
 caused extensive damage -the whole    
 church was completely gutted.         </content>
