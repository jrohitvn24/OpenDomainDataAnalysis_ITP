		<content> Hawley Equitation Centre was built in 
 the early{1800s}and was first used as 
 a cavalry stables.The owner does not  
 breed his own horses,he buys them from
 a number of sources.At present there  
 are {45}horses and ponies here,some   
 are used for riding lessons and others
 are livery horses.The horses work here
 until they reach the age of {20}.     
 Nine people work at the stables,{4}are
 instructors who live in mobile        
 homes,and {5} are trainees who work   
 for free whilst they are being trained
 as instructors.The horses food is kept
 in metal containers so that rats,the  
 damp,and wandering horses don't get at
 it.There is a chart that tells how    
 much each horse should eat.The horses 
 are also fed on straw.They are given  
 one bucket of water during the day and
 two at night.Most of the ponies are   
 put out to grass at night.            </content>
