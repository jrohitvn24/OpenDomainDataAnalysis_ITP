		<title>10The Angel Inn</title>
		<content>   My name  is Brigitte Jarvis, I am   
 eleven years old and I live in a pub  
 in Woolhampton run by my mum and dad. 
 It is called The Angel Inn. It has a  
 bar and a fuction room with skittle   
 alley. It has two rooms for people to 
 stay in. It has just been refurbished 
 and we had a new restaurant built with
 a stain glass dome in the roof.       
   We need a lot  of food so we have   
 got four fridges and four freezers.   
   In the restaurant we usually take   
 bookings but some people just come    
 in and want a table and if we have    
 a spare table we let them eat in the  
 resturaunt.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
