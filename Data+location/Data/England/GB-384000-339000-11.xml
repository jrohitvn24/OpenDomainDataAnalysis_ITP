		<content>The block of shops comprises a         
hairdressers salon,butchers,newsagents 
which also houses the sub post office,a
chemist,a small grocers supermarket and
a greengrocers.These shops are closed  
half a day on Mondays.There is also a  
video hire shop an outfitters and a    
D.I.Y and garden shop.There is also a  
garage called Trentley Service         
Station.This garage provides servicing 
and body repair work.It was the most   
expensive of the garages for petrol but
is open 7 days a week and petrol is    
served to customers.On New Inn Lane is 
the farm called New Inn Lane Mill.This 
seems to be the oldest building in this
part of Trentham.Here geese,hens and   
horses can be seen from the road.Almost
opposite to this is a private house    
where about 20 hens are kept and again 
these can be seen from the road.
