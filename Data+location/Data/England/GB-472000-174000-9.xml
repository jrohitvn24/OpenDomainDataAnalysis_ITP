		<content> The safety at Caversham Park is very  
 good.There are numerous paths leading 
 to minor Roads and there are only two 
 main Roads which are not normally very
 busy.                                 
   There is a centre for a play group  
 and ballet also. In about 1982 a new  
 youth wing was built and every year   
 about 2_3 plays are put on as well as 
 a pantomime at Christmas.In the youth 
 wing there is roller_booting as well  
 as a drama club.In the holidays there 
 are many activities for children such 
 as music, drama, sewing and knitting  
 for girls and football or cricket for 
 boys. Sometimes as a group they go out
 to the swimming pool or to a musem.   
 There is a duck pond round by the     
 schools where children often go to    
 search for tadpoles and snails for    
 nature study.
