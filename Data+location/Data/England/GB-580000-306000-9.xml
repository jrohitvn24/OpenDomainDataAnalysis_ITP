 My name is Louise Mortimer I used to  
 live in London but we moved from      
 London to Swaffham there is a lot of  
 difference between the two places.    
 For one London is very much busier    
 than Swaffham a road of traffic in    
 London daily is as much as Swaffham on
 a Saturday. My dad decided to move    
 because the schooling and because I   
 couldn't go out much after school     
 in case of trouble.Also he got a      
 better job so we had to move.         
     When we got to Swaffham it was    
 ever so much different compared to    
 London it was quieter and there       
 weren't children running about like   
 hooligans.The schooling was different 
 because in London they didn't have    
 sets for any subjects.
