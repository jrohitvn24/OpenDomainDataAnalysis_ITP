		<title>11THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>My dad trains the{ football} team, he  
says he is too old to play so on       
Saturday he goes and supports the      
football team.  I go with him.  On     
Thursday in the village hall there is  
Brownies I go there.  Sometimes there  
are discos at the village hall, I think
they are very good.  Every Sunday there
is childrens' church.  Sometimes there 
is a village open day when you can look
round the village.
