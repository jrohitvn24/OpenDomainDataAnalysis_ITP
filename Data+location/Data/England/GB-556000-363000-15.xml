		<title>15School Sports in Skegness</title>
		<content> On Wednesday 17th July 1985 it was    
 Sports' Day. The afternoon came       
 very quickly. All of the children in  
 the school took part. Each class went 
 on to the field led by a banner with  
 their class number on. It was a lovely
 day and parents watched as the        
 children raced. First were the flat   
 races and everyone cheered and waved  
 their mascots in the air. It went on  
 through the afternoon, everyone       
 running their race until the last one 
 had been run. After that everyone     
 crowded round while P.C.Gill,The      
 Community Policeman, presented the    
 trophies. Our class won a trophy      
 for beating the other fourth year     
 classes. After the presentations we   
 helped to clear away the chairs that  
 the parents had been sitting on.      
 Everyone had enjoyed Sports' Day.
