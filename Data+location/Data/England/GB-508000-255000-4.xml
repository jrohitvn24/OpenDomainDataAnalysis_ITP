		<content> THE BLOCK POPULATION IS ABOUT 500.    
 The age structure seems reasonably    
 well-balanced. Wilden is far from     
 being a dormitory village for         
 long-distance commuters. About a third
 of the working population is employed 
 in the area, and on the land, about   
 half work in Bedford, and the rest    
 commute greater distances e.g. London.
     In {housing,} there is an even    
 distribution of old, new, private and 
 rented. There is a rich diversity of  
 styles, some of historical interest.  
     The occupation pattern shows a    
 surprising balance between long-term  
 residents and newcomers. Also of      
 interest is the fact that many        
 long-term residents live in relatively
 new houses, while the newcomers occupy
 the more historic houses.New housing  
 development supports housing for the  
 elderly.                              </content>
