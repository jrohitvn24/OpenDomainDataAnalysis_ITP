		<title>08Education in Rode.</title>
		<content> A playgroup on Tuesday and Thursday   
 mornings provides pre-school education
 for children from three years old.    
 Some then go on to the many private   
 schools near Bath, but the majority go
 to Rode Methodist First School. Pupils
 also travel from other villages. The  
 school takes boys and girls aged      
 four to nine. Built in 1860, it has   
 recently been beautifully modernised  
 and extended. There are 63 pupils in  
 three classes, who learn in groups.   
 There are two teachers and a Head (who
 teaches for 70% of the time). The     
 Christian traditon of the school is   
 reflected in morning assembly and     
 daily prayers. Older pupils travel to 
 Selwood Middle School, Frome, and     
 transfer at 13 to Frome College.      
 Children with special educational     
 needs are taken by minibus to Frome.
