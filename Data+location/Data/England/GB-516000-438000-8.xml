   Withernwick County Primary school   
 was first built in 1846 and then added
 to in 1862.These two dates can be seen
 on one of the school walls.The school 
 was first called the National School. 
   The school has two classrooms and   
 had 45 children on roll in the Summer 
 Term,1985.The school is for children  
 from 5 years to 11 years of age.      
   In 1965 there were only 13 children 
 at the school but more houses were    
 built and so more children came to    
 live in the village and the school was
 able to continue.                     
   When the pupils are 11 years old    
 they travel on the local bus to the   
 comprehensive school in Hornsea.      
   The children from New Elerby &amp;      
 Marton travel to Sproatley P. School  
 &amp; South Holderness School.            </content>
