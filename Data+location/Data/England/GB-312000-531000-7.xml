		<title>07Cockermouth music centre</title>
		<content> The music centre is held every        
 saturday morning at the Castlegate    
 site of Cockermouth school. It caters 
 for the Cockermouth and district      
 children (roughly 160) whose ages     
 range from 7-18. 120 of them are      
 primary school children. A variety of 
 instruments are played ranging from   
 recorders to basoon tubas to          
 saxaphones. The main organiser is     
 Richard Bennet, who is aided by three 
 members of staff.                     
   About five concerts are held each   
 year, at least one a term.            
 Performances are given by two wind    
 bands, an orchestra and a string,     
 brass and recorder ensemble.          
   Money to run the centre is provided 
 by Cumbria county council and from    
 donations by audiences.               
   The aim of the centre is to make    
 music fun for players and listeners.  </content>
