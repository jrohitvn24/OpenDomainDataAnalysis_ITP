		<title>15RUNNING A HOTEL,WIGLEY</title>
		<content>  Guests at the New Forest Moat House  
 usually stay only one night.They are  
 mainly businessmen in winter and      
 tourists,both British and foreign,in  
 summer.More old people come than young
  Evening entertainment includes dinner
 dances and piano playing.Visitors can 
 go horse riding easily at an adjacent 
 riding school,run on 13acres of land  
 rented from the hotel.There are       
 special arrangements for children and 
 pets are allowed in the rooms but not 
 in the restaurant.                    
  The motel employs 50 people including
 8 cooks,10 maids and one gardener,all 
 living locally.The hotel has its own  
 dog and three cats.                   
  There is no problem with noise from  
 traffic especially since the M27 was  
 built.In fact the motorway has caused 
 a decrease in custom.
