		<content> In the early years of the 16th century
 Lord Thomas de la Ware built himself a
 chantry chapel to provide for the     
 offering of masses for his soul after 
 his death."A church within a Church." 
 He also employed Lambert Barnard who  
 is noted as the only English painter  
 of his genre who is personally        
 identifiable to paint the vaulting of 
 the nave with the arms and crests of  
 his own and his wife's family and her 
 ancestors'. It is also decorated with 
 botanical signs in Flemish Renaissance
 style.                                
 The Church today has several stained  
 glass memorial windows bearing legends
 which sufficiently explains them. The 
 West window was blasted by a German   
 bomb in 1940 and all that remains is  
 the"holy Spirit in the form of a      
 dove"                                 
 There are 420 medieval documents      </content>
