		<title>19WETHERBY - IN NORTH YORKS.?</title>
		<content>  In the 1974 reorganisation the       
 Boundary Commission placed Harrogate  
 in West Yorkshire, under the control  
 of Leeds. Harrogate opposed their     
 inclusion in West Yorkshire and as a  
 result became part of North Yorkshire.
 A similar campaign of opposition has  
 now been proposed with the aim of     
 transfering Wetherby into N. Yorks.   
 Within the Wetherby ward a commission 
 (politically unbiased) was established
 to investigate the advantages of      
 moving into North Yorkshire. They said
  "It follows that the market town of  
   Wetherby and its surrounding rural  
   villages, many of which are in North
   Yorkshire, cannot be described as   
   Metropolitan in any way."           
 Two other factors favour the case for 
 North Yorkshire, these are higher per 
 capita spending on education and a    
 lower rate compared to Leeds.         </content>
