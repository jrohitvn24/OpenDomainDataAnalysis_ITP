		<title>04HOUSING IN KEMBERTON</title>
		<content>  A number of houses are conversions of
 other buildings. Two barns, a mill, a 
 blacksmith's shop, a wheelwright's    
 shop and an old post office are now   
 private residences. The canteen and   
 gatehouse of Kemberton's Second World 
 War airfield are now bungalows.       
  There are two groups of semi-detached
 council houses, one group of six built
 in 1933 and another of 4 built in 1943
 Most of these are now owner-occcupied.
  There are also a number of houses    
 built in the 1960s and 1970s. They    
 include some farm cottages but most   
 are substantial detached houses. Some 
 have been erected where other         
 buildings have been demolished. One   
 house stands on the site of the old   
 wooden village hall, and there is a   
 bungalow on the site of the 'Fighting 
 Cock' inn.
