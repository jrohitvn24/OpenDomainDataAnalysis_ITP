 RUSH QUEEN. To continue our tradition,
 we need a Rush Queen for the Rush-    
 bearing on Sunday 29th September at   
 1.30pm. and the vicar would like the  
 names of girls interested before the  
 end of school term so that the Urswick
 Parochial Church Council can decide   
 as soon as possible.                  </content>
