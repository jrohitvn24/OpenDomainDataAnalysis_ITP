		<content> The area of Pitchcroft is 100 acres.It
 is mainly a racecourse.  They have 19 
 race meetings a year.Other sports     
 there are rugby,soccer and lacrosse.  
      Part of Pitchcroft is a camp site
 for tents and caravans. Near the camp 
 site is a play area,with a roller     
 skating rink,swings,a horse and       
 a helter-skelter.                     
      As Pitchcroft is near the        
 river,there is a water-sports centre  
 for the canoe club and the rowing     
 club.You can have boat trips from     
 nearby North Quay-selfdrive,steamers  
 or launches.Lots of people fish from  
 the banks,and walk along the footpath.
   Fairs come to Pitchcroft for bank   
 holidays,and the carnival gets ready  
 there.Sponsored walks are held round  
 the racecourse to raise money for     
 charity.
