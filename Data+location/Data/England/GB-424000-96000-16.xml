		<content> Bashley is a linear village of less   
 than 150 houses stretched mainly along
 the busy and narrow B3058 on the edge 
 of the New Forest. The village has one
 church, St John's, two village halls, 
 a village store and post office, a    
 garage, a riding school, a sports     
 field, two residential caravan parks, 
 two saw mills, several farms,         
 nurseries and orchards and two chalet 
 and caravan holiday parks. The village
 has no public house, a bus service    
 only on Saturdays and Tuesdays and no 
 school. Most children in the village  
 travel to schools in New Milton. In   
 the grounds of the Bashley House      
 Private Hotel is an avenue of beech   
 trees complete with an ornamental     
 well.
