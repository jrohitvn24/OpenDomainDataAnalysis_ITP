		<content> Two rivers cross the area - the Piddle
 and its tributary, Bere Stream. They  
 join here and flow on past Hyde House 
 and Wareham into Poole Harbour. They  
 are chalk streams, fed by springs, and
 the clear water supports water        
 crowfoot, watercress, trout and       
 salmon. There is an artificial fish   
 pond by the Piddle, where fishing is  
 private. A stretch of Bere Stream near
 Bere Heath Farm is used for research  
 by the Freshwater Biological          
 Association Laboratory and is a site  
 of Special Scientfic Interest.        
 Kingfishers, common toads, bogbean and
 marsh orchids are found by the rivers,
 and grass snakes and badgers live     
 nearby. Some ll0 acres of heathland   
 are leased to the Dorset Naturalists  
 Trust by A.R.C. as a Reserve, which   
 conserves the habitats of smooth      
 snakes, toads, adders, amongst others.</content>
