		<content> Four "C" class roads take a high      
 volume of through traffic, private &amp;  
 commercial. Speed limits are difficult
 to enforce especially at morning and  
 evening peak periods. Week-ends and   
 harvest-time also present problems.   
 Other roads are mainly cul-de-sacs    
 serving residential areas. Access to  
 the village may improve with building 
 of a roundabout on the proposed Kings 
 Langley by-pass,(due 1986) but at cost
 of increased traffic &amp; urbanisation.  
 2 infrequent bus services link village
 with Hemel Hempstead, Kings Langley,  
 Watford, Croxley and Rickmansworth.   
 Timings aim to serve local workers,   
 schoolchildren and less effectively   
 shoppers.There are no Sunday services.
 Most households find life restricted  
 by the public transport system and so 
 own cars to meet  the requirements of 
 work, school, shopping and  leisure.  </content>
