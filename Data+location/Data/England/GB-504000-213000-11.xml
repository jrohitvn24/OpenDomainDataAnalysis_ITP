		<title>11SHOPKEEPER</title>
		<content> Our village shop stocks most things   
 and it is used by the whole village.  
 Some people do all their shopping     
 there but most people actually only   
 buy a few things,preferring to buy    
 their weekly groceries at larger      
 supermarkets where prices are cheaper.
 The main village shop is part of a    
 larger chain called Spar,it is also a 
 Post Office so it is important to     
 local people especially the old for   
 their pensions.The local post is      
 sorted from this Post Office and many 
 locals collect papers from the        
 newsagent part.There is also a butcher
 who used to work for another butcher  
 in the next village,but now has his   
 own shop and it is very popular.There 
 used to be many other shops in the    
 village but as people got more        
 transport they went to the towns.
