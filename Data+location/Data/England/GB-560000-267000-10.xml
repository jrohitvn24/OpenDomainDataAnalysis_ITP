		<title>10Fordham Abbey, Fordham.</title>
		<content>   The present Fordham Abbey was built 
 in 1790. Only the Dove Cote remains   
 of the original site where the        
 Gilberteen Monks used to live. There  
 are 60 acres of grass-land and 200    
 acres of arable land and the          
 live-stock includes a herd of cattle. 
 The present owners and their children 
 have lived in the house for 25 years. 
   Recently they have built modern     
 offices and out-buildings as the farm 
 has grown.The owners employ 8 staff   
 comprising 4 farm workers and 4       
 domestic staff. Through their land    
 flows the River Snail which is now    
 polluted because of the nearby sewage 
 works. Their land contains a chalk    
 pit, a wood with a water-tower, and   
 below this a natural spring from which
 their Hereford/Fresian cattle drink.
