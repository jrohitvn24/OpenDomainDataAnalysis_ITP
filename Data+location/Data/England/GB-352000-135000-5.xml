		<title>05Cheese Farming</title>
		<content> The cheese farm at West Town House    
 receives 10000 litres of milk daily   
 from their own and other local farms. 
 They employ four people.              
 The milk is stored in five tanks      
 leading into the pasturiser. Rennet   
 is added to turn the milk to curds    
 and whey. The curd is cut into small  
 pieces by a machine, being restacked  
 and turned until all the whey is      
 sqeezed out. Salt is added to help    
 preserve the cheese which is packed   
 in cloth-lined moulds. These Cheddar  
 cheeses, which are approximately 40   
 pounds each in weight, are pressed for
 twenty-four hours and then stored in  
 wooden boxes in a cold room.          
 As well as 300 pounds of butter, 250  
 tons of cheese is produced each year. 
 Some is sold locally but most is      
 sold to the Cheese Marketing Board.
