		<title>08HOME LIFE THE GOOD SIDE</title>
		<content> We all live in families mostly with   
 Mum, Dad and 2 or 3 children. Most of 
 us have our own room or share with one
 other. We use it as a bedroom, and a  
 playroom and work room. Usually the   
 family has an eveving meal together   
 either in the kitchen or the living   
 room. Breakfast is a rush with people 
 going to work or school so we eat at  
 different times. Midday meal is either
 at school or a quick bite.            
 Most days the family gets together to 
 chat, watch T.V., play games like     
 monopoly or go out for days or family 
 visits. We do some jobs around the    
 house, play with friends or amuse     
 ourselves. We read, draw, play        
 electronic games, make models with    
 construction sets, play with the      
 computer.
