		<title>18FARMING IN SUTTON IN ASH.</title>
		<content>   {INTERIEW WITH MR.R.CASTLE.         
  Mr.Castle was born on a farm in 1953.
 His father had bought 60 acres to     
 fatten livestock for the butchers shop
 which had been in the family for 200  
 years.Today the farm is used for      
 experimental crops such as triticaley 
 a rye and barley hybrid,but this year 
 he plans to erect a 10,000 sq.ft.     
 building where two men will rear 200  
 calves for slaughter.He is concerned  
 about the use of chemicals and plans  
 to grow organic cattle feed to improve
 the quality of the meat.He learnt     
 about farming by working with his     
 father but now has to keep up with    
 scientific developments.Farming has   
 changed a lot in his lifetime,it is   
 more profitable and uses more machines
 He likes his work-he can see the      
 results,but insecurity is a problem   
 due to E.E.C.rule changes.            </content>
