		<title>08RIVER OTTER</title>
		<content> The river Otter usually flows quietly 
 from its source in the Blackdown Hills
 to the sea at Budleigh Salterton.There
 have been occasional floods, the worst
 being in July 1968. During a period of
 10 minutes on the night of July 10/11 
 the heavy rainfall caused the water   
 level to rise by 1.30m. The bridges at
 Fenny Bridges and Tipton St John were 
 swept away but St Saviours bridge at  
 Ottery and Cadhay and Gosford bridges 
 withstood the flood. Much damage was  
 caused particularly to the Ottermill  
 Swichgear factory and the houses      
 nearby. Island Farmhouse was flooded. 
 The water reached chest height in the 
 downstairs rooms. The entire stock of 
 timber of Ottery Sawmills was swept   
 downstream. Twelve caravans on the    
 caravan sitewere swept away and five  
 motorists were trapped at Cadhay.
