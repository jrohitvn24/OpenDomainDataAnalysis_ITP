		<title>17Walking, Riding in Strelley</title>
		<content>   "I used to live on Helston Drive,   
 Strelley Estate. Now I am married I   
 live in Bramcote but I still like     
 walking through the village of        
 Strelley. We walk from where we live, 
 down Bilborough Road and up Sandy Lane
 to get through into the village.      
 Sometimes we go into Cossall and      
 Awsworth. We go over the first M1     
 bridge, walk all the way round Cossall
 and come back over the first motorway 
 bridge again. It's a long walk. When I
 was little I had riding lessons. With 
 living near Strelley I got to know a  
 lot of people who stabled their horses
 there. One man from Bilborough kept   
 five horses opposite the Broad Oak Inn
 He used to let me ride on one of them.
 So I soon found all the bridlepaths   
 there are round Strelley. Sometimes I 
 used to go out for a full day's riding
 and take a packed lunch with me."     </content>
