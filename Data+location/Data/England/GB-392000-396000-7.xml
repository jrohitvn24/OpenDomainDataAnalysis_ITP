		<content>        The only slaughter house in the
 whole area is Dixon's bacon and pork  
 processing factory. Every week        
 5-6 thousand pigs are slaughtered.    
 These pigs come not only from the     
 surrounding areas of Lancashire,      
 Yorkshire and Cheshire but also from  
 Lincolnshire and as far away as       
 Scotland. Once the animals arrive     
 they are slaughtered and jointed.     
 Joints are delivered to outlets such  
 as butchers and manufacturers of meat 
 products; pork pies, sausages, cured  
 ham, etc.                             
        About 180 people are employed  
 within the factory. A fleet of heavy  
 trucks is used to transport the goods 
 to Manchester, Yorkshire, Cheshire and
 North Wales. A small number of trucks 
 are used for local retail deliveries.
