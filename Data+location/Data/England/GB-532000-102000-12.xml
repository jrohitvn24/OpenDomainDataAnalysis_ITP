		<title>12BRIGHTON MARINA TODAY</title>
		<content> The 50 hectare site of the Marina is  
 enclosed by 2 breakwaters, and is     
 sufficient for 2,000 boats. After the 
 seabed had been dredged, 110 caissons 
 using 1000 tonnes of concrete, were   
 emplaced to form the breakwaters. An  
 outer tidal harbour is separated from 
 an inner, non-tidal harbour by a      
 causeway. A lock provides the         
 connection between outer and inner    
 harbours, the largest non-industrial  
 lock in Europe. The first berths were 
 available in l977. The Marina was     
 opened to the public in l978 and the  
 completed harbours were opened by the 
 Queen on 3l May l979. For a short time
 a hydrofoil conveyed passengers to    
 Dieppe but its profitability was      
 marred by frequent blockades by French
 fishermen.Today tourists are attracted
 by an annual boat show and an ex-Royal
 Navy ship on permanent public display.</content>
