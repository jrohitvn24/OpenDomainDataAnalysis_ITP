		<title>14Holidays on the marshes</title>
		<content> Many tourists come to our area. On one
 particular summer day while we were   
 out six coaches passed us in less than
 twenty minutes, they were on tours    
 probably out from Eastbourne. There   
 are several places where motorists    
 may stop and enjoy the peace of the   
 marshland. Cyclists too, because of   
 the flatness of the area can enjoy    
 exploring with little huffing and     
 puffing up and down hills. People come
 here because it is peaceful, it is    
 fairly easy to find quiet little      
 corners and forget the busy main roads
 nearby. One word of warning unless you
 are a walker, you will need your own  
 transport,the bus service is not good.
