		<title>14An opinion about discipline</title>
		<content> I attend Westlands School Torquay.We  
 have to wear a uniform.The uniform is 
 grey for girls with a red tie and blue
 for the boys with a blue tie.Many of  
 the uniform rules are pointless,for   
 example-only one ring,bracelet or     
 necklace,no studs larger than half a  
 centimetre in diameter.What has this  
 to do with our education? Nobody      
 knows.Socks have to be worn even in   
 the middle of summer.Stilletoe shoes  
 are not to be worn because they damage
 the floor but many female teachers    
 wear them.Hair isn't allowed to be    
 more than two natural colours.Make-up 
 isn't allowed until the fourth year   
 and then it is only eye make-up.      
    The School rules on uniform are    
 mostly unnecessary.
