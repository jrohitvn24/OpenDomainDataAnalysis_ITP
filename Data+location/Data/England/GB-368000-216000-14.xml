		<content>{Royal Spring Farm Longhope.           
  When everyone had jam for tea there  
 was an enormous demand for            
 plums. Nowadays more people prefer to 
 pick and freeze soft fruit. Royal     
 Spring Farm just outside Longhope     
 grows{strawberries,raspberries,black  
{and red currants and gooseberries }as 
 well as {plums and apples.}Local      
 tradition says that the farm's name   
 arose when Charles l stopped at the   
 farm to drink from the Spring during  
 the Civil War. The farm,owned by Mr   
 and Mrs J.Rogers ,grows about 5 tons  
 of strawberries,4 tons of raspberries 
 and currants each year.Notices in the 
 local press and outside the farm tell 
 the public when the fruit is ready.   
 Families love to spend a pleasant     
 time picking fruit in summer sunshine 
 in lovely surroundings, saving money  
 for winter treats.                    </content>
