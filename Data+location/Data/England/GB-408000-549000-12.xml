		<content> Just about everyone goes to the{Sports
{Centre.}There are lots of things to do
 there.When I go there mostly on a     
 Saturday, I play{five-a-side football 
 with my friends, but first you have to
 book a court to play.Whoever wants to 
 play with you, everybody has to put a 
 bit of money towards the court. For   
 the older people they could{play bowls
 on the green on the inside.The idea of
 the game is to get your bowls nearest 
 to the white ball which is called the 
 Jack. The one who does is the winner. 
   The idea of the game in{basketball  
 is for one team to pass the ball to   
 each other going down the hall and    
 when one of the players has got a     
 chance they jump up and try to put the
 ball in the net, and the team with the
 most points are the winners.
