		<title>19THE FUTURE-SUTTON ST JAMES</title>
		<content> We have tried to describe our         
 village, almost all of which is       
 included in our D - block, as a       
 friendly, lively, yet very ordinary   
 place. It is probably no different to 
 many other fenland villages, except   
 that we live here, and we think it    
 very special.                         
 What will happen in the future ? Will 
 all the cottages along the main street
 be demolished to make way for a new   
 moterway linking Spalding,            
 Peterborough and King's Lynn ? Will   
 tower blocks be built to house the    
 families ? No, all of this is very    
 unlikely.We feel that Sutton St James 
 will continue very much as it has     
 always done.After all, the land will  
 always be used to grow food.Perhaps   
 less people will be involved in land  
 work because of technological         
 development.                          </content>
