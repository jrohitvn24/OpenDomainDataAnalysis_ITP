		<title>16Alf Strange. Blacksmith.</title>
		<content>  Alf Strange can make almost anything 
 out of iron as he is a blacksmith. He 
 started work at the age of fourteen,  
 46 years ago, and had 7 years         
 training.                             
  Nothing in Alf's smithy works by     
 electricity, it is all hand powered.He
 has a lot of imteresting horse shoes  
 but he has not made them all himself. 
 His oldest horse shoe is about 600    
 years old. He could make about 24     
 shoes in one day, which would shoe six
 horses. He makes pokers and lots of   
 other iron things as well.            
  He has to pump the bellows while the 
 iron is in the fire. When you pump the
 bellows it sends more oxygen into the 
 fire to make it burn more fiercely.   
 When the iron is red hot he stops     
 pumping the bellows. Alf says that in 
 a few years blacksmiths will only be  
 able to fit horseshoes not make them. </content>
