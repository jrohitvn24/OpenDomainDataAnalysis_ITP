		<content> We have 3.750 km of river in our 12   
 km area.The River Ouse is fed by the  
 rivers Swale Ure and Nidd .In the past
 the river was used for transporting   
 goods but now it is used for fishing  
 and pleasure boats{.Fishing}in the    
 River Ouse is coarse fishing the main 
 fish caught are gudgeon, chub, perch, 
 dace and rudd.The bait used would be  
 maggots,bread paste and worms,or red  
 cheese.which is a favourite bait for  
 chub The River Ouse is also used for  
{drinking water.}The water authority   
 have a pumping station at Moor Monkton
 on the opposite bank to Beningbrough. 
 Water is pumped out of the river into 
 a lagoon to settle,then through a     
 filter.It is then pumped through pipes
 to the resovoir in Leeds.
