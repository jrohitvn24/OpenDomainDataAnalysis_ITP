		<title>01GENERAL OVERVIEW</title>
		<content>{The area is mainly farmland, with a   
{dozen farms mainly engaged in the     
{Dairy industry, but with some sheep   
{and beef cattle. There are patches of 
{mainly deciduous woodland. The River  
{Torridge runs down the centre, with   
{its tributary, the Waldon crossing the
{south west corner of the grid. Much of
{the land is pasture and riverside     
{meadow, the grass crops being gathered
{as hay and silage. Arable crops are   
{grown mainly for cattle feed. At the  
{eastern side of the grid is part of   
{the village of Shebbear, with part of 
{the smaller village of Thornbury in   
{the west. The majority of the roads   
{are narrow with high banks and hedges.
{Shebbear is a village centre          
{supplying educational, medical,       
{garaging, and to a lesser extent      
{shopping services }
