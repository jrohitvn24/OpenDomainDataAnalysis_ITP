		<content> Most of the information on this survey
 was collected by third form pupils of 
 Prince Henry's Grammar School, Otley. 
 The work was carried out during the   
 summer term, 1985, by classes 3W, 3L  
 and 3E, under the supervision of Mr.  
 Hattersley and Mrs. Brighouse. Special
 help was given by Mary Leefe, Nicola  
 Helliwell and Kirsty Lord in entering 
 the text pages when the classes ran   
 out of lesson time!                   
 Information was also gathered by      
 pupils of Ashfield First School,      
 Otley, under the direction of Mrs.    
 Wilson, and this was incorporated in  
 the main text and survey.
