The 1986 entry is still substantially correct. If anything the Nature Reserve has been expanded and re-landscaped to convert it from the farmland it was in 1986 into a series of scrapes and shallow ponds for birdlife.Part of it is being used by the Environment Agency as compensation habitat, i.e. it is shortly to be flooded, allowing the Agency to enclose other areas along the coast for flood protection.&lt;br />&lt;br />The local flood protection has been massively improved in 2008/9 to increase the defences for both Rye and Rye Harbour by means of a bund from Winchelsea Beach to Rye Harbour, together with raising the flood walls along the River Rother towards Rye   &lt;br />
