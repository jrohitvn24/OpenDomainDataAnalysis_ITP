		<title>13     WANDLEBURY TREES</title>
		<content>   64 types of tree, 25 types of shrub.
 17,000 trees over 6 inches thick and  
 1\m. high. 60 one year old saplings   
 planted in February. Tallest tree is  
 96 ft Lime. A 90 year old redwood will
 soon be taller. Biggest tree is a     
 Beech 15 feet 4 inches in girth. Dutch
 elm disease destroyed 600 elms. 5     
 remaining elms also affected. 4000    
 trees planted in past 11 years, all   
 paid for by general public or groups  
 e.g. schools, Guides. Most common tree
 was elm, is now sycamore. Beech grows 
 well here as it tolerates the chalky  
 soil. This shallow soil can lead to   
 instability of the trees. After a tree
 was uprooted in a recent storm the    
 skeletons were found of Iron Age      
 people killed in battle and left to   
 lie where they fell. Rotten trees not 
 cleared but left to encourage insects,
 food for other wild life.             </content>
