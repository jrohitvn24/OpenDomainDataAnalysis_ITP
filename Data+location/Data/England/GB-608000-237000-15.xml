		<title>15Shopping in Bentley</title>
		<content>In Bentley we have several places to go
shopping.At Bentley stores you can buy 
food,sweets,household items and        
cards.There is a sub post office in the
shop.There are some things which the   
Stores doesn't have or which are very  
dear so many people go into Ipswich or 
Colchester for most of their shopping. 
At Uplands fruit Farm you can buy      
apples,pears,eggs and apple juice.     
Next to Bentley stores there is a      
unisex hairdressers                    
Sometimes people sell surplus produce  
forn their gardens from stalls outside 
their house.
