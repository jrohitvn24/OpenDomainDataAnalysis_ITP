		<content> They had no milkman.They had to go to 
 the farm that was near them with a    
 metal can.                            
   He  had a few pets and they were    
 cats.This was to get rid off all the  
 mice.                                 
   They used to get all the water from 
 a well and then boil it.              
   They had no electricity so they used
 candles and paraffin lamps.           
   They used to get 1pence-2pence for  
 pocket money,which was a lot in those 
 days.For 1pence you could get around  
 12 chews!                             
   After the children had left school  
 they worked on a farm.                
   There was a bus twice a week to go  
 into town.                            
   They had 1 grocery shop in Boothby  
 and this sold all the daily goods like
 our Mace or Spar shop.
