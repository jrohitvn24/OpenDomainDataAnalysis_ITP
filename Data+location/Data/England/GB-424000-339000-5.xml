		<title>05The Pottery</title>
		<content>   Mr.J.Hermanson has owned the pottery
 for about ten years. He started there 
 on his own and now employs twelve     
 other people. They work for eight     
 hours a day from 8.30am until 5.30pm  
 with an hour for lunch break.The      
 pottery uses about 5 tons of clay a   
 week.The day is brought by lorry from 
 Stoke-on-Trent where it is processed. 
 Approximately 720 pots are made each  
 week in various shapes and sizes.Most 
 are made in moulds using tools called 
 profiles to shape the pots.The kilns  
 take 200 pots at a time and when      
 glazing is taking place about 350 are 
 done at a time.The pots are coloured  
 iron,honey, oatmeal and nutmeg.The    
 workers are all local people who have 
 gained experience as they have  worked
 there.Packers sometimes work in the   
 evening and a new store warehouse has 
 been opened but expansion is expected.</content>
