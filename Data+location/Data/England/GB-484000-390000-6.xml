		<title>06Wharton Woods The gamekeeper</title>
		<content> The gamekeeper of Wharton Woods is    
 Patrick Plant.  Mr Plant's job is to  
 keep the wood in order.  He controls  
 pests by trapping and shooting.Themost
 destructive pest is the grey squirrel 
 which strips the bark off the trees   
 and leaves thm prone to disease.      
  Mr Plant's other important task is to
 rear phesants and partridges for game.
  In the summer Mr Plant rises at 6    
 a.m., he attends to the pheasants to  
 make sure they have clean water.  He  
 then checks the trapto see if he has  
 caught anything.  Summer is also the  
 fishing season so he has to cherck the
 fisherman's permits.                  
  Mr Plant has two dogs one gun dog and
 a guard dog.  He has a problem with   
 poachers and thieves stealing the     
 pheasants.  Offenders are always      
 prosicuted, if they are caught!
