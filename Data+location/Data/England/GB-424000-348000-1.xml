		<title>01      INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>  This is a rural area of Derbyshire.  
 There is one village, Kirk Ireton, two
 hamlets, Ireton Wood and Biggin by    
 Hulland and several scattered farms.  
  The block is on the southern edge of 
 the Pennines with grassy hills, stone 
 buildings, thick hedgerows and a few  
 stone walls. A lot of the buildings   
 are quite old. Some have been         
 modernised and a number of new ones   
 have been built, but there has not    
 been a lot of development compared    
 with some places.                     
  There have been a greater changes in 
 people's life styles. A lot of people 
 have moved out of the city and towns  
 to live in the village. They travel to
 work, not like the old days when most 
 people worked on farms.               
  A few houses are now holiday cottages
 and if the Carsington reservoir is    
 built, more tourism should result.    </content>
