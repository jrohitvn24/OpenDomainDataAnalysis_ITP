		<content> There are 4 full time teachers (inc.  
 the head) and one part time teacher   
 (0.3). All other staff are part time .
 There are 106 on roll from 5 to 11    
 years. A crossing patrol helps        
 children across the main road and to  
 and from the school bus. The clerical 
 assistant works for a short time in   
 the mornings sorting out dinner       
 money, registers, etc. At lunch time  
 meals come from central kitchens in   
 Exeter. Two kitchen assistants help   
 serve the meals, and wash up. Two meal
 time assistants supervise during lunch
 time which lasts from 12.10 pm to     
 1.20 pm.                              
 Only a quarter of the children eat    
 school meals, the rest bringing packed
 lunches. The school day begins at     
 9.05 am and finishes at 3.30 pm. We   
 also have a cleaner-in-charge and two 
 cleaners.                             </content>
