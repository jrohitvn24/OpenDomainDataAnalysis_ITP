 2 Earthwork in Great Park is the site 
 of a C12 "Deer Hay".In medieval times 
 the wild deer were driven into the    
 stockaded earthwork in the autumn and 
 fed with hay during the winter. There 
 they were culled so ensuring a regular
 supply of fresh meat through the      
 winter. Now although a historic monu- 
 ment the site is overgrown with mature
 trees but traces of the ditch and     
 vallum still remain.
