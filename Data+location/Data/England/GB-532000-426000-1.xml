		<content> Withernsea is a small seaside resort  
 on the east coast 20 miles from       
 Hull,with approximately 5,000         
 permanent inhabitants.It is backed by 
 the flat farming lands of Holderness  
 and a network of often narrow roads   
 link the town with a number of small  
 villages.The town is dominated by the 
 disused lighthouse,situated several   
 hundred yards inland.Coastal erosion  
 is a constant threat and strong sea   
 defences have had to be constructed.  
  Although a holiday resort the main   
 season is short and most holidaymakers
 stay on caravan and chalet sites.The  
 town has a sand and shingle beach with
 safe bathing.Protection is afforded by
 an RNLI inshore lifeboat.The only     
 significant feature on the seafront is
 a castellated gateway,the sole remains
 of a pier.Currently the town is best  
 renowned for its open market.         </content>
