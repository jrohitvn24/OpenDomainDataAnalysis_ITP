		<content> On the Feckenham Wylde Moor Nature    
 Reserve there is a hide from which    
 members of the Worcestershire Nature  
 Conservation Trust and their visitors 
 can enjoy the wildlife.               
                                       
 Here a few pairs of snipe breed       
 regularly, reed buntings and owls nest
 and there has been a sighting of a    
 bird which has come to Britain from   
 France, the Cettis Warbler.  Many     
 birds of prey visit during the winter 
 when several short-eared owls can be  
 detected.  Also regularly seen are    
 Moorhen and Heron.                    
                                       
 There is a large rookery in a small   
 wood in Shurnock.  Here there are up  
 to 100 rooks' nests mainly situated in
 Oak Trees but also in Ash Trees.      
                                       
                                       </content>
