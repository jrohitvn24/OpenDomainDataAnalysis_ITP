		<title>14SECONDARY REVIEW, CLITHEROE</title>
		<content>    In September 1985 Clitheroe's      
 secondary schools will change. The    
 two Grammar schools will gradually be 
 joined together. Whilst the sixth form
 girls will eventually join with the   
 sixth form boys at the Boys school all
 the pupils who passed the '11+' this  
 year will come to the Girls school.   
    Some people think that the         
 amalgamation is a good idea but others
 do not. For instance a second year    
 girl did not think this was a good    
 idea as it did not apply to the whole 
 school. But some first years thought  
 it would be good to have a change.    
    Everybody interviewed thought it   
 was better to have the Girls Grammar  
 School as the main site because the   
 playing fields are near to the school.
 It was also thought they have better  
 facilities although new buildings are 
 having to be constructed.             </content>
