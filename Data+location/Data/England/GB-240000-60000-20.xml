		<content> Cornwall is the home of many myths and
 legends. It is supposedly the home of 
 the pixie - or 'piskey' - as they are 
 locally known. Many standing stones   
 abound in the County, although none in
 our block. East Cornwall is similar in
 landscape, attitudes, and customs as  
 those found in Devon the land across  
 the County border, the River Tamar.   
 A Honey Fair is held annually at the  
 nearby town of Callington, and a      
 Cherry Feast held at St. Mellion,     
 bordering Landulph Parish. There is a 
 Carnival held every year in Landulph  
 and every two years a flower festival 
 organised by local market gardeners.  
 The oldest building in our block is   
 the Landulph Parish Church, in which  
 is buried the last of the Roman       
 Emperors.
