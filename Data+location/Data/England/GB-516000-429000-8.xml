 Our area is perhaps very average in   
 that it  does not have any really     
 outstanding personalities although    
 there have been visits made by several
 important people.  The Duke of        
 Edinburgh opened the Youth Club       
 attached to the local secondary       
 school.  Cliff Richard is a personal  
 friend of the local vicar and he has  
 been to stay at the local rectory.    
 Tessa Sanderson winner of the womens  
 javelin gold medal at the 1984        
 Olympics visited the school to promote
 an appeal for funds to send athletes  
 to the Los Angeles Olympics.
