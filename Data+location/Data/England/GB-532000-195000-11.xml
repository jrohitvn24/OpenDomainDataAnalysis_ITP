		<title>11Housing in Enfield Town</title>
		<content> The area surrounding the market place 
 provides a rich variety of domestic   
 and commercial architecture. The      
 vicarge dates back to medieval times  
 and many other buildings testify to   
 Enfield's rich historical past.Most   
 housing in the area dates from 1890 as
 this market town became absorbed onto 
 the northern spread of London which   
 accompanied the development of the    
 railways. Typical of this period is   
 the ornate Edwardian villain London   
 Rd. or the smaller terraced dwellings 
 housing the growing artesian          
 class.{Gentlemans Row}exhibits former 
 humble farm labourers cottages which  
 date back to 1680(now modernised &amp;    
 extended), to grander Georgian houses 
 with room for servants &amp; stabling.    
 Today this area provides a haven of   
 peace from the busy traffic.
