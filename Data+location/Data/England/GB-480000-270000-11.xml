		<title>11Transport - Traffic survey</title>
		<content>                                       
We did a survey one morning between    
8.30am &amp; 9.30am on the road in and out 
of Walgrave and on the main Kettering  
-Northampton road.(A43) The survey was 
on how many bicycles, cars, vans,      
lorries, motorcycles, tractors, buses  
and other vehicles went through.The    
cars were the most numerous on both of 
the roads.On the Kettering to          
Northampton road (A43) there were 634  
cars, 100 vans, 100 lorries, 13        
motorcycles ,1 crane, 0 tractors and 0 
bicycles.On the road through Walgrave  
there were 73 cars, 8 vans, 1 lorry, 1 
motorcycle, 1 bus,0 tractors , 4       
bicycles,and 1 milkfloat.Obviously the 
A43 is much busier than the village    
road.
