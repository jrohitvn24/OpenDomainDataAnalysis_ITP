		<title>13ST. LEONARD'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The oldest remaining building in      
 Frankley parish is St.Leonard's Church
 which was built circa 1200AD.It is set
 well away from any town in the dairy  
 farming part of old Frankley.It is    
 used regularly for christenings,      
 marriages and burials by the local    
 community.The church and parish       
 registers are rare in being complete  
 from the year 1598.These show the     
 occupations of Frankley people over   
 the centuries.The majority were farm  
 labourers and today most of the land  
 is used for dairy and arable farming. 
 Because of agricultural importance few
 of the people served in either of the 
 two great wars this century.The vicar 
 has importance in the community and   
 visits both local schools and old     
 peoples' homes.
