		<title>12TRAFFIC SURVEY (PART 1)</title>
		<content> We did a traffic Survey in            
 Bishopthorpe Village.  One group did  
 an experiment to see how good a blind 
 person was at detecting vehicles.     
 Lorries were easy to pick out, but    
 some cars were very difficult.        
 Another group looked at makes of cars.
 Those made by Ford were the most      
 popular, and blue cars werre seen most
 frequently, closely followed by red.  
 Another person found that Bedford was 
 the most popular make of truck.       
 The busiest road was found to be Main 
 Street, closely followed by Sim Balk  
 Lane. Appleton Road was the quietist  
 road.                                 
 The traffic flow in and out of the    
 village was also studied. Peak        
 movement out was between 8.00am and   
 8.30am and movement in, 5.30 to       
 6.30pm.                               
                                       </content>
