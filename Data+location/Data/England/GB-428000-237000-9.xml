		<content>   Harvest Time is still widely        
 celebrated in the village.Traditional 
 Thanksgiving Services are held in the 
 three churches with the emphasis,as of
 old,being placed on the harvest of the
 land.A large congregation gathers     
 annually in the beautifully decorated 
 St.George's Church and the 'Cathedral 
 of the Feldon' rings with joyful      
 harvest hymns.                        
   Other harvest services are held at  
 the Church of England Primary School, 
 the Feldon Club and the Geeorge Hotel.
 It is customary for the produce to be 
 auctioned after the services and the  
 proceeds donated to charity           
   The climax of the harvest season is 
 a gathering of all denominations at   
 the Harvest Supper in the Village Hall
 with food prepared by the ladies and  
 homespun entertainment organised by   
 the vicar.                            </content>
