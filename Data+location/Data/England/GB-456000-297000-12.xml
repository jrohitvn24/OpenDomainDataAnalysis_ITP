{Young Offenders Centre, }built in     
 1974.He is a senior prison officer,one
 of 238 officers in charge of 680 pris-
 oners.All the inmates are boys aged 14
 to 21.They stay there for up to 3 yrs.
 During the day,the prisoners have to  
 work.They earn about Â£1.60 a week.Some
 of them are allowed out to help with  
 Community projects.A group of them    
 helped to dig out our swimming pool. {
{(Parklands).}In the evening they play 
 snooker,table tennis and watch T.V.   
 Every third evening they are locked up
 in their cells until 7.30am.Mr.Ramsey 
 keeps his keys and whistle on a long  
 chain. Three prisoners have escaped   
 during the past ten years.{During     
{the 1980's discipline amongst young   
{people has become a major social issue
{in view of rising violence and crime, 
{particularly from football hooligans. </content>
