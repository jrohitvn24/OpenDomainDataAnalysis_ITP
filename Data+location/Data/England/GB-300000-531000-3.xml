		<content> Flimby has quite a number of shops for
 its size.Seaton has about 16.This is  
 only because it is a large village.   
 Siddick has 1 shop.In all of these    
 places the people go to the village   
 shops just for odd things like bread, 
 beans and sugar etc.The weekly        
 shopping that they get is from big    
 shops in the towns.They usually go to 
 Workington because it is cheap.They go
 to big shops like the Co.op Superstore
 or Marks and Spencer.The people go    
 clothes shopping in Carlisle or big   
 clothes shops in Workington.Maryport  
 is a quite expensive town.That is why 
 most people go to Workington.Carlisle 
 is the largest town in the area.That  
 has got places like The Lanes and a   
 very large Marks and Spencer.
