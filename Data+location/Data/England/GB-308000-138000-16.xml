		<title>16The Doniford Stream</title>
		<content>     Flowing right across the middle of
 this Block is the{Doniford Stream.    
 By the time it has reached the South  
 of this area from its source high up  
 on the{Brendon Hills}it has taken on  
 all the characteristics of a river in 
 middle age.                           
     For much of the year it winds and 
 meanders peacefully through its narrow
 valley.   However it drains large     
 areas of upland both on the Brendon   
 and Quantock Hills and this means     
 after{heavy rain}the stream rapidly   
 rises to the level of its banks.   The
 colour of the stream in this spate is 
 a bright reddish brown.               
     There are a number of places      
 within this block that are subject to 
{flooding}at such times, the water     
 meadows at{Sampford Mill Farm}being   
 aptly named.
