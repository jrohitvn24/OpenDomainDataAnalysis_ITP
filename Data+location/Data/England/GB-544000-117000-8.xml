		<content>   This{'family'}School,built in about 
 1862,is surrounded by countryside. It 
 is a{Church School}and has End of Term
 Services at St.Michael's Church.      
   There have been{major changes}in the
 past 20 years. A wooden building was  
 erected in two phases as the original 
 was not adequate. The first part was  
 finished in 1968,the second in 1971.  
 When{Isfield School}closed in 1970    
 because of falling numbers,16 pupils  
 were transferred to Horsted bringing  
 the number on roll on 3.9.70. to 67.  
   The most pupils there have been was 
 99. The limit is now 80. Its{catchment
{area}is quite large. More children are
 now coming from{Ridgewood}than from   
 the{Isfield}area. Most pupils from    
 Isfield come by coach but some travel 
 in cars as do the Ridgewood children. 
 Few walk as the roads are busy &amp; it is
 more convenient to come by car or bus.</content>
