		<title>14TOURISM IN PORLOCK</title>
		<content>                                       
 Porlock is a picturesque village      
 edging the Exmoor hills by the sea.   
 Its attractions include walking,riding
 fishing and generally 'get away from  
 it all' facilities.There is a pebble  
 beach,keeping away commercial         
 interests and companies.Tourism is    
 now the basis of Porlock's economy    
 saving it from serious{financial      
{problems.}Tourist information and a   
 museum are run by local volunteers    
 who provide a{free newspaper.}The     
 price of a holiday is slowly going up 
 mainly because of inflation.This is   
 not really a place that young couples 
 come to unless their children are on  
 holiday and then they mainly go to one
 of the two{caravan sites.}Porlock has 
 lost large numbers of tourists since  
 the direct Taunton to Minehead{railway
{line}was{cut}in the seventies.        </content>
