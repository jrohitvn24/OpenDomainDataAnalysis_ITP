		<title>02HISTORY OF MORTEHOE</title>
		<content>     The name Mortehoe possibly        
 comes from a Germanic word            
 meaning short or stumpy, and          
 probably refers to Morte Point        
 in comparison with Baggy point        
 south of Woolacombe.                  
     There is evidence that the area   
 was settled in Stone Age times, and   
 the Domesday Book mentions Morthou as 
 a small manor with a home farm, two   
 smallholders and one serf, the estate 
 of Ralf de Limesi, William's nephew.  
 In the twelfth century, it is         
 believed, Henry II banished one of the
 Knights who murdered Thomas Becket, de
 Tracy, to Mortehoe, where his family  
 held land.  There is a family tomb in 
 the church, though the guilty Knight  
 went off to do penance in the Holy    
 Land.
