		<title>10SCHOOLING IN ATWORTH</title>
		<content>  The Parish Church of St Michaels     
 together with the nearbye             
 Non_Conformist Chapel are village     
 centres and have good congregations.  
  The Atworth Primary and Junior school
 is still a going concern with children
 travelling in from outside to         
 attend,such is the reputation.For     
 secondary education the children from 
 the east end of the village travel to 
 The George Ward school in Melksham    
 while those living to the west attend 
 St Laurences in Bradford_upon_Avon.A  
 few go to Bath to St Marks.           
  The Stonar Sshool, a girls private   
 day and boarding school is housed at  
 Cotles, one of the old Manor Houses to
 the south of the church.The school    
 makes little impact on village life.
