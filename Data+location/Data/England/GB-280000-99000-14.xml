		<title>14Jackson's the sweet factory</title>
		<content>   Jackson's is a sweet factory and it 
 was first established in 1817. Where  
 it was first established is now being 
 turned into flats. It is now in the   
 middle of the town.                   
   One of the workers has been there   
 for twentytwo years. He started       
 in 1963. He gets paid roughly Â£74.28  
 per week and gets some medicated      
 sweets for his family and relations.  
   Jackson's make medicated sweets,    
 linseed sweets, cashews, pastilles and
 imps. They also take some of these    
 sweets to shops for them to sell to   
 the public.
