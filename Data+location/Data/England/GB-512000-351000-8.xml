		<title>08FARROWAY PUMPING STATION</title>
		<content> We visited the pumping station called 
 the{Farroway Depot.}It was built in   
 1948 and is owned by{Witham First     
{Internal Drainage Board,}Lincoln      
 Division.The first pumping station was
 built in 1854 to drain the fenland    
 into a man-made river called the{River
{Skirth.}The original building is      
 owned by{Anglian Water.}Water can now 
 be pumped at the rate of 1200 litres  
 per second from{Anwick Fen Drain}and  
{Ruskington Fen Drain.}Water can also  
 flow freely from the Skirth back into 
 the Farroway Drain which runs in      
 between the other two. The pumps work 
 automatically when the water reaches a
 certain level. The man who showed us  
 round said his father and grandfather 
 had worked at the station before he   
 did.
