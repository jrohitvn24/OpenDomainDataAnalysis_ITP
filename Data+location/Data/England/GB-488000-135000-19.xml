		<title>19A TYPICAL WEEKEND DAY</title>
		<content>   MY HOME LIFE IS SUCH THAT I WAKE UP 
 AT SIX THIRTY AND DO SOME OF MY       
 PREP.THE REST OF THE FAMILY WAKES UP  
 AT ABOUT 7.3OAM. FIRST MY MOTHER HAS A
 BATH AND THEN MY FATHER. AT LONG LAST 
 WE GO DOWNSTAIRS TO BREAKFAST. MY     
 SISTER EATS HER BREAKFAST SO  FAST    
 IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. WHEN SHE'S FINISHED
 SHE RUSHES INTO THE PLAYROOM WHERE SHE
 STAYS FOR MOST OF THE DAY.            
  AT 9.OAM I GO TRAMPOLINING AT THE    
 SPORTS CENTRE. I FINISH MY            
 TRAMPOLINING AT IOAM. SOMETIMES WE GO 
 SHOPPING.  IF WE DON'T, WE GO HOME AND
 I FINISH MY PREP.                     
  AT ABOUT 12NOON WE HAVE LUNCH. AFTER 
 LUNCH MY PARENTS HAVE COFFEE.         
  USUALLY WE GO FOR A WALK OR WE GO TO 
 A MUSEUM OR A STATELY HOME. SOMETIMES 
 WE AMUSE OURSELVES OR JUST GET UNDER  
 EACH OTHER'S FEET. OUR BED TIME IS    
 8.45, BUT I USUALLY READ A LITTLE.    </content>
