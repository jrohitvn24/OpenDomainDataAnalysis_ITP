		<title>13ST JOHN'S CHURCH, KNUTSFORD</title>
		<content>   This Georgian church was opened in  
 1744 and is almost 250 years old.     
 Previously there was a church called  
 St.Hellenas on the northside of       
 Knutsford next to a street called     
 Boothfields.  Here you can see a      
 grassed area which has tombstones on  
 it, this is the churchyard of the old 
 church, which served the whole of     
 Knutsford.  Since St.John the Baptist 
 Church was opened in 1744 there has   
 been one major alteration which took  
 place in 1880. The Church has many    
 activites like Sunday School(3-11),   
 Pathfinders(11-14) and Eureka(14-18)  
 The Church has four services a week.  
 The age group of the congregation is  
 from babies to 97 years old. There is 
 a good response to all the churches   
 activities and it plays an important  
 part in Knutsford's life.
