		<title>11COMMUNITY POLICE -N.LEEDS</title>
		<content> P.C.TINDALL wanted to be a community  
 policeman because he thought it was a 
 good way of getting to know           
 everybody.He does not live in the area
 because if some people do not like    
 policemen they would be able to annoy 
 him at home.His area is approximately 
 3sq. kilometres, but he is sometimes  
 called out of his area when there is a
 shortage of men in emergencies. He    
 visits 5 schools and talks to them    
 about road safety and the law. The    
 children make friends with him and    
{trust}him. He also assists old people 
 to use the new Pelican crossing on    
 Street Lane and lets them into their  
 homes when they lose their keys.P.C.  
 Tindall likes his job most of the time
 because he likes meeting people and he
 likes us to see him as{a friend}who   
 will help us if he can.
