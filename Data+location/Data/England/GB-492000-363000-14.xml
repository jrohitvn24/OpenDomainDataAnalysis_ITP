		<title>14CHURCHES AND CHAPELS</title>
		<content>   Within our area there are two Church
 of England Churches and a Methodist   
  Chapel.  The Churches and the Chapel 
 are well attended at each service and 
 each has quite a thriving Sunday      
 School for the children to attend.    
   Going to church does not play an    
 important part in the lives of most   
 people  in our area although many     
 people do believe in a God and they   
 follow a Christian way of tradition by
 getting married in a Church or by     
 having their children Baptised, even  
 though they might never go to church. 
 This is due more to a Tradition  of   
 such events rather than actually      
 receiving 'God's blessing'.           
   Religion in the area is not strong  
 and is dominated by the Christian     
 belief. The congregations at the      
 services are made up of a cross       
 section of ages, but mainly women.    </content>
