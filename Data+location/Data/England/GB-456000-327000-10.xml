		<title>10GYPSUM MINING NEAR BUNNY</title>
		<content> My dad works at the Gotham Gypsum Mine
 near Bunny.The mine runs for about 3  
 miles underground and one of the long 
 tunnels, called the Silver Seal Mine  
 comes out at Bunny. Gypsum has been   
 mined in Bunny for 200 years.         
 Five rocks are mined, called;{Satin   
{Spar,Marl,Anhydrite,Alabaster}and most
 of all{Gypsum.}The machines he uses   
 are a drill rig for drilling,ready for
 blasting, and a load haul dump machine
 which loads,hauls,dumps and transports
 blasted rock from the rock face to the
 crusher. There are about 50 workers   
 down the mine and about 150 workers on
 top. The Gypsum is made into plaster  
 by grinding it and then cooking it and
 grinding it again. Many chemicals are 
 added. The plaster is bagged and sold.
 A miner's job is fairly hard work and 
 my dad works from 0800 to 1700 hrs.   
 Some weeks he works the night shift.  </content>
