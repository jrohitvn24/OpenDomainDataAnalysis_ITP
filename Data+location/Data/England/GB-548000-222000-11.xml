		<content>{An interview with a local resident.}  
 I have lived in Stansted for over 67  
 years,moving here just after the war.I
 met my husband here.He worked for the 
 local nursery all his life where they 
 used to grow grapes,tomatoes and some 
 flowers.The nursery supplied{Covent   
{Garden}in{London.                     
 I helped my husband to carefully pick 
 the tomatoes,an important job as they 
 had to be{'just on the turn',}not too 
 green and not too ripe.               
 In 1930 the nursery employed 175      
 workers,but work declined as the years
 went by and in 1975 the nursery closed
 down.Now the nursery is owned by an   
 Italian family and they run just a few
 greenhouses for growing tomatoes,     
 cucumbers and some flowers.           
 My husband worked very hard for his   
 living and he died some 8 years ago.  
 I now live with my daughter.          </content>
