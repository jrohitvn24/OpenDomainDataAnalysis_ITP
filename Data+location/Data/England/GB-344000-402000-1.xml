		<title>01Summary of the Area</title>
		<content>The area is mainly a green belt area   
between the town of St Helens and the  
new town of Skelmersdale. There are two
very small residential areas,          
Bickerstaffe and Barrow Nook and one   
which is slightly larger Rainford      
Junction.                              
        In close proximity to Rainford 
Junction is Rainford Village where most
of the local facilities can be found.  
Rainford  Village does not come into   
our area.                              
  The area is well situated with       
regard to the road network system being
only minutes from the East Lancashire  
road, M58, and the M6. The area is also
split by a dual carriageway-the        
Rainford by pass-which forms a direct  
link between the M58 and the East      
Lancashire Road.
