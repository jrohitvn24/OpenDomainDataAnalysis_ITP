		<title>05HITCHIN PRIORY (1)</title>
		<content>   In the year 1317 Edward II granted a
 charter for the setting up of a{      
{Carmelite}Priory in Hitchin which     
 eventually grew on its present site   
 just off Tilehouse St. From its       
 beginnings the Priory grew to be a    
 centre of worship and scholarship,but 
 by the end of the 15th century the    
 community was in financial            
 difficulties. In 1534 following Henry 
 VIII's break with Rome the Priory felt
 the axe of the resulting Dissolution. 
 Stripped of its lead,bells,painted    
 glass and other valuable articles,it  
 was left in a state of partial ruin.  
 Little now remains of the{Carmelite}  
 Priory except for the thick walls and 
 church arches in the cloisters.       
   The Priory's revival began when     
 Ralph Radcliffe,who had opened a      
 school in the remaining buildings,    
 purchased the site in 1548.           </content>
