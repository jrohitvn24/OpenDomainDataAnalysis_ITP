		<title>02POPULATION OF UCKFIELD 1.</title>
		<content>    Much of the housing in Uckfield is 
 modern,built in the last 20years.There
 are 3 private housing estates,{Manor  
{Park,Rocks Park and Ridgewood.        
    We live on  Manor Park. It was     
 completed about twenty years ago and  
 was built on the grounds of a large   
 manor house formerly occupied by Lord 
 Nevill who was a friend of Queen      
 Elizabeth.The Queen sometimes visited 
 the house.Some of the roads help us to
 remember this situation,for example   
 Nevill Road and Queen's Approach.     
    Forty questionnaires were sent to  
 our parents;twenty to mothers and     
 twenty to fathers,none of them being  
 in the same family.These              
 questionnaires sought the origins of  
 our parents and the reasons for them  
 coming to Uckfield.They also asked    
 whether our parents were content here 
 and any reasons for discontent.       </content>
