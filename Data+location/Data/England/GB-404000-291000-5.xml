		<content>Walsall Road Police Station opened in  
1968 is now just for beat officers of  
Â£C'Division, policemen who walk around 
a certain area every day whilst they   
are on duty.Policemen use two-way      
radios to keep them in touch with      
their base;they are able to call       
assistance very quickly or check out   
imformation by tuning into the police  
national computer.James told P.C       
O,Loughlin his father's car number     
which was checked out and reported     
back giving colour,type and owner's    
address within one minute.             
 Officers visit the schools on their   
Â£beat'and talk to the children about   
the work of the police force or they   
help with project work.                
 P.C Evans introduced a Â£Crime Watch'  
at Glenmead School and he posted up    
stolen car numbers for the children to 
watch out for.                         </content>
