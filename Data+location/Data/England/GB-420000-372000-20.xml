		<title>20Slurry Dams - New.</title>
		<content> At the top of Coombs Dale in an area  
 called Blakeden Hollow, and south of  
 what was Black Harry Farm, a dam has  
 been constructed to contain slurry,   
 waste left from fluorspar processing  
 at Cavendish Mill. The dam was allowed
 on appeal to the Secretary of State   
 for the Environment.                  
 The dam that was built is by Black    
 HarryGate and provides for the        
 enclosure of slurry up to about the   
 315 m contour. Just over half the     
 slurry area of 30 hectares comes      
 within this block. The centre point of
 the slurry area is at about 201743.
