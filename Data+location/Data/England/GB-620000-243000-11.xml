        Britannia School Fair          
 On Saturday 15th June our school had a
Summer Fair.  Lots of schools have them
but I am  goimg to describe what it was
like.   We had  to  pay  10 pence for a
programme. There were two competitions,
one to see how  many  things  you could
get   into  a  matchbox   and  one  for
colouring a picture.                   
                                       
   There  were  20  stalls  altogether,
like White Elephant, Books and Records,
Toys,   Sweets   and   Grocery,   Video
cartoons, Badge  making, Face painting,
Handicraft,   Wellie   throwing,   Pony
riding, Grand  draw  and a  Magic Show.
There   were  also   refreshments  like
cakes, Panda-Pops, crisps and icecream.
In the White Elephant stall there  were
quite  a  few  different  things   like
clothes, games and antiques.           </content>
