		<content> THE TELEPHONE PLAYS A LARGE ROLE IN   
 THE LIFE OF MOST OF THE HOUSEHOLDS    
 WITHIN OUR GRID.  ALL THE MARKED FARMS
 HAVE A TELEPHONE AS THEY ARE QUITE    
 ISOLATED ESPECIALLY CANK FARM, WHICH  
 HAS THREE HOUSES AND ALL HAVE A       
 TELEPHONE. AT LEAST 8O% OF THE OTHER  
 HOUSEHOLDS HAVE A TELEPHONE, MANY WITH
 EXTENSIONS IN THE BEDROOM. PUBLIC     
 TELEPHONE BOXES ARE SITED IN BOTH     
 VILLAGES.                             
 THE POSTAL SERVICE IS STILL QUITE GOOD
 WITH DELIVERIES AND COLLECTIONS TWICE 
 DAILY MONDAY TO FRIDAY AND ONCE ON    
 SATURDAY.                             
 LOCAL NEWSPAPERS ARE DELIVERED FREE   
 OF CHARGE TO MOST HOUSES AND THESE    
 KEEP PEOPLE INFORMED OF LOCAL AFFAIRS.
 ADVANCE NOTICE OF EVENTS LIKE JUMBLE  
 SALES, GYMKHANAS AND HOUSES / GOODS   
 FOR SALE IS ALSO PUBLISHED IN THESE   
 NEWSPAPERS.                           </content>
