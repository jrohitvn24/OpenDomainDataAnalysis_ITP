		<content> York Football is probably the most    
 popular sport for boys in 1985 and 3rd
 division York City has a lot of       
 support in this area. Two York players
 live in Rawcliffe. Derek Hood from    
 Washington on Tyne-side has played for
 York for 5 years. Keith Houchen is    
 from Middlesborough and has played    
 here for two years. They train at     
 Clifton Hospital ground for 6 hours a 
 day out of season and 2\ hours in     
 season. They say they enjoy living in 
 Rawcliffe because of good amenities   
 and friendly people. Recent cases of  
 football hooliganism in this country  
 and abroad have shocked Derek Hood and
 Keith Houchen prefers "kicking a ball 
 to kicking players." Recent successes 
 mean bigger attendances (average 5691)
 and despite occasional incidents York 
 has a family club reputaion.
