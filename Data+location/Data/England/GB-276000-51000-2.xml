 Moreleigh is a small village situated 
 on the B3207 1km E of the A381 between
 Totnes and Kingsbridge.  It is partly 
 within Halwell and Moreleigh parishes.
 The population is 100.  It is a       
 working largely agricultural village, 
 businesses consisting mainly of       
 self-employed farmers and agricultural
 contractors/engineers.  There is also 
 a haulage contractor and a builder who
 runs an undertaking business and has a
 chapel of rest on the premises.       
 Moreleigh has escaped much of the     
 second home and retirement development
 experienced by many other villages -  
 it has few community facilities, with 
 potential for more.  A village hall is
 in prospect and there is a social     
 committee which organises several     
 successful events each year.
