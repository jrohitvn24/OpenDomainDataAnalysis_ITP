		<title>05Unemployment in Alresford.</title>
		<content> Unemployment levels are less than     
 those nationally but this can be      
 attributed to the class of the        
 village.  Alresford is essentially a  
 middle class area and during a        
 recession the types of jobs in which  
 they are employed tend to be more     
 secure because of the amount of skill 
 and knowledge required.  Many women in
 the village take on seasonal work,    
 such as fruit picking, but they cannot
 be counted as unemployed because they 
 do this work in addition to their     
 primary role of housewives.  To them  
 employment is a supplement rather than
 a necessity.
