		<title>19WITTERINGS REST HOMES</title>
		<content> There are an increasing number of     
 people,over the age of 65,living      
 with-in the Witterings.Many live      
 locally within their own homes,but    
 there has been an increasing demand   
 for retirement residences,either small
 flats or rest homes.                  
 The attraction for many elderly people
 retiring or moving into the area is   
 the favourable climate during the     
 Summer months,the flat nature of the  
 terrain,and the close proximity of the
 services within the village of East   
 Wittering.                            
 Groups of children visited one of our 
 local rest homes.When visiting        
 Seagulls Rest Home they discovered    
 that it is a home where people can go 
 and live if they are lonely,or in need
 of help of any kind,or if they can no 
 longer manage to look after           
 themselves.                           </content>
