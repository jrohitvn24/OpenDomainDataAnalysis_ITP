		<title>10HOME LIFE: SPAR SHOP ROOKLEY</title>
		<content>                                       
     Mrs.Lord, the Assistant Manager of
 the Spar Shop, lives in Newport. She  
 has 2 children, both girls. Mrs.Lord  
 likes the area because it is friendly,
 and near to most schools. The shop    
 gets a lot of trade from tourists and 
 campers who go into Rookley Country   
 Park and cross the road to buy food   
 and drink.                            
     Although it is called {"Spar" }the
 shop is really a farm shop.           
     One of the regular customers of   
 the{"Spar" }is  Mrs. Ainsley who lives
 just around the corner with her       
 invalid husband. She has 2 children   
 both of whom are married; one living  
 on the Island and one in Africa.      
     Mrs. Ainsley has lived in Rookley 
 for 16 years and at one time worked as
 a nurse at Whitecroft Psychiatric     
 Hospital.                             </content>
