Brownies is an international           
organisation for girls between the ages
of seven and eleven years.Brownies wear
a brown tunic uniform to their meetings
which take place once a week.The girls 
are divided into small groups called   
sixes which have names such as Pixies, 
Gnomes, Sprites and Elves.Each member  
is required to make a promise at a     
special ceremony when she joins,this   
is called an enrollment  .She promises 
to "do her best,do her duty to God,to  
serve the queen,and to help other      
people."The adult leaders in a pack of 
Brownies are called Brown Owl and Tawny
Owl and they organise activities for   
the Brownies each week.
