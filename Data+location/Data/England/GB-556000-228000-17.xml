		<content> Many place names are of Saxon origin. 
 Broxted is from Brocces Heafod,       
 Badger's Head or hill. Sibleys is     
 derived from the Saxon name Sibba or  
 Sibbi. Horham means a muddy dwelling. 
 This historic house and gardens are   
 open to the public several times a    
 year in aid of charities. New Amberden
 Hall is an old house which was        
 completely moved to a new site. Many  
 people claim to have heard singing    
 from the deserted church at Chickney. 
 The dismantled railway goes right     
 across the area from beyond Sibleys to
 Thaxted. Some of it forms a pleasant  
 footpath where wild flowers and birds 
 can be seen. Other parts are overgrown
 and neglected but still make a        
 valuable preserve for plants, birds   
 and animals. A short path on it leads 
 to the reservoir at Sibleys Halt and  
 Thaxted Station is now a coal depot.  </content>
