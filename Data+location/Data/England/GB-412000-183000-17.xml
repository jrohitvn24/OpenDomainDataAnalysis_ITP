		<title>17Fire-fighting in Swindon.</title>
		<content> The local fire-brigade have had 1350  
 call-outs in the past year, of which  
 200 were hoax calls. The main types of
 fire are chimney fires in winter and  
 grassfires in summer.                 
 The area covered is 60 square miles   
 with 3 pumps, 1 turntable ladder, 1   
 emergency salvage vehicle and 16      
 fire-men.                             
 A special problem to the fire-service 
 is the Murray John building in        
 the town centre due to its height.    
 The most unusual call out this month  
 was to free a child from a plastic    
 potty stuck on his head. Youngsters   
 are often rescued by fire-men.        
 The M4 Motorway runs close to Swindon 
 and traffic accidents occur. Six      
 people were killed recently in a      
 multiple collision with firemen called
 out to cut people from the wreckage.
