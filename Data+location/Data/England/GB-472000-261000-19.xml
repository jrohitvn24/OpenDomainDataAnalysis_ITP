  Our area differs from corner to      
corner.One part is an industrial estate
with factories and distributors.The    
rest of the area is mainly housing.Some
houses are privately owned but most are
council houses.There are quite a few   
shops, a Police sub-station,a Lower    
school and a Middle school.            
  A railway runs through the middle of 
the area.Three bus routes also pass    
through the area they are the 8/28, the
2/20 and the 22 services.              
  The factories include a disused oil  
storage depot and three wholesalers.   
There are also some government offices.
Some of the local people work on the   
estate.                                
  There is a Youth Centre which caters 
for the teenagers and an Old Peoples   
Centre but no other entertainments.
