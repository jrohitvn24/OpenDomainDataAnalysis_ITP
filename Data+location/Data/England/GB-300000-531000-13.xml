		<content> In our block the main transport for   
 people who haven't got a car are      
 buses and trains.The main transport   
 is by private cars,when our class did 
 a survey on how many vehicles passed  
 in one hour the total for cars was    
 550,there were 12 cars with trailers  
 ,12motor cycles.12 buses and coaches, 
 102 light goods vehicles and 78 other 
 goods vehicles.Altogether the total   
 came to 784 vehicles going both ways  
 on the A596.We have 3 different bus   
 services going each way,usually from  
 Workington to Maryport,then on to     
 Carlisle sometimes going the other    
 way from Maryport through Flimby to   
 Workington and then on to Whitehaven. 
 About 5 passenger trains go through   
 Flimby each way,every day.
