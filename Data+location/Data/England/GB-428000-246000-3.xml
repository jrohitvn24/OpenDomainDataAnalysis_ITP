		<content> The parish church of St Mary Magdelene
 is the only church in our D block.It  
 serves those  who profess the Church  
 of England religion and other         
 denomination must travel at least 3   
 miles to worship.Alot of the carving  
 in the church was done by a Miss      
 Mills.When she got angry she would    
 come to the church and carve.She      
 carved, the alter in the lady chapel  
 and the vicors chair.The chancel arch 
 is distorted through settlement and   
 leans leftwards.There are marks on the
 pillars from the old wood screen. In  
 the church yard are three trees       
 planted by fiends of St Marys to      
 commemorate royal events.The first    
 commemorates the marriage of          
 Prince Charles, 1981.The other were   
 planted in 1977 to commemorate the    
 Silver Jubilee.
