		<title>07    HIGHCLIFFE  CASTLE</title>
		<content> The castle was a beautiful building   
 but sadly fires damaged it in 1967 and
 1968 and it is now falling down. In   
 the 19th century Highcliffe Castle was
 built to replace an earlier mansion   
 built by John, 3rd Earl of Bute in    
 1770.The present Castle was started by
 his grandson, Lord Stuart de Rothesay 
 in 1830. It took him four years to    
 build. In Victorian times the village 
 was called Newtown, but in 1892 it was
 renamed Highcliffe after the castle.  
 On the 1st January 1977 Christchurch  
 Council took control of the house and 
 the grounds of the castle. In June    
 1977, to celebrate the Silver Jubilee 
 of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the
 grounds were opened to the public. At 
 the castle today people can walk in   
 the grounds and follow a footpath to  
 the beach.
