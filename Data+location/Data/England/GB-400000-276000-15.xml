		<title>15SCHOOL DAYS</title>
		<content>The best time in school is christmas   
and easter. Every year we sing songs   
for old people and they enjoy it very  
much. A few weeks before Christmas we  
do songs and plays. In 1984 we did a   
play called The Snow Queen. My friends 
Cleo, Julia and Paula were in it. Cleo 
robber and looked nice in red and      
black. Julia played a crow and didn't  
have to sy anything. She was dressed in
a black suit with a bright yellow beak.
When she came on stage everyone laughed
because she lpooked funny. Paula played
the Snow Queen> she wore a beautiful   
white dress and a gold and white crown.
en there is nothing special going on in
school the best day is Thursday because
go swimming straight after play.
