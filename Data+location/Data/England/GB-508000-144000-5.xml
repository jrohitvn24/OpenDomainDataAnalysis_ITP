 Sometimes I get dressed before        
 breakfast.   Normally I have Weetabix 
 but sometimes Rice Krispies.          
 Afterwards I have toast with butter   
 and honey.  When we get to school we  
 sit on the carpet and take the        
 register.  We go into the hall for    
 Assembly.  We say 'Good Morning       
 everyone'.  We sing songs like 'Down  
 came the Raindrops' or 'The Golden    
 Cockerel' and say prayers.  We come   
 back into the classroom for Maths.    
 After we have done our sums we drink  
 our milk and go out to play.  After   
 play we do some writing in our books  
 and some reading. Sometimes we watch  
 Words and Pictures or Music Time on   
 Television or we have recorder        
 lessons.  At l2o'clock one of us puts 
 up the menu.   We go into the hall for
                                       </content>
