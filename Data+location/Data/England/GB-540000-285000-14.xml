		<title>14Chatteris - A Child's Day</title>
		<content> For an hour we struggle with Maths.   
 We work individually and have to have 
 every sum correct.  Playtime comes at 
 10.30 when we run around and shout for
 15 mins.  For the rest of the morning 
 we have more hard work to do.  Twelve 
 0'clock is lunch time.  Some          
 children have hot lunches, some bring 
 a packed lunch and some go home to    
 eat.                                  
                                       
 Afternoon school lasts from 1.15 to   
 3.30.  We do many different things    
 like Art, Music, Games and Projects.  
 After School I attend a Church Choir  
 practice then have tea at home.  In   
 the evening I usually watch T.V. and  
 go to bed at 9.30.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
