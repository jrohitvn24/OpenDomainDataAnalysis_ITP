 The A27 flyover was built in 1968.  It
 is constantly in need of repair mainly
 due to damage caused by salting the   
 roads in winter.                      
 The Boat House belongs to Lancing     
 College, and the pupils use the river 
 for sailing and canoeing. Near the    
 Boat House the motor-boats are washing
 away the mud, so the river banks are  
 being built up with chalk by the Water
 Authority.                            
 South of the A27 flyover is the Pony  
 and Donkey Centre of about 9 acres,   
 where about 20 of them can  be hired  
 for riding. A private developer owns  
 the field and he is wanting to build a
 Supermarket. The local residents      
 welcome the idea because there are no 
 other similar facilities in the       
 immediate area.
