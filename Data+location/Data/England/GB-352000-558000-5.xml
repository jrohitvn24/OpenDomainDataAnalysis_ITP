		<title>05Woodland of the area.</title>
		<content> The whole area is well wooded with    
 mature deciduous trees and conifers.  
 Beech, Oak, Ash, Sycamore and Larch   
 grow to full size in the hedgerows,   
 along the streams and roadsides and   
 round the golf links.                 
 An extensive area of ancient natural  
 woodland stretches along both sides of
 the river Gelt. The wood is managed by
 the Brampton Parish Council and is    
 open to the public.                   
 Beech and Oak predominate but there   
 is a huge variety including Wych Elm  
 to Western Hemlock. The conifers      
 present have been planted, and some   
 felling and re-planting goes on.      
 The undercover is mainly bracken and  
 bilberry.                             
 A footpath goes right through the wood
 from Low Gelt Bridge to the Middle    
 Gelt with other pathways leading from 
 it.                                   </content>
