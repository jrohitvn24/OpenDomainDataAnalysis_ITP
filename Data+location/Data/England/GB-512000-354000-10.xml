		<content> AT SCHOOL WE PLAY GAMES LIKE BUDGE    
 AND TIGGY ON THE WHITE LINES.         
 BUDGE IS A GAME WHERE THERE IS ONE    
 PERSON ON AND THE GREEN POLES ARE HOME
 (PART OF THE SCHOOL BUILDING). THE    
 PERSON WHO IS ON HAS TO TIG SOMEONE   
 WHILE THEY ARE NOT ON A GREEN POLE.   
 IF THE PERSON WHO IS ON TIGS YOU WHILE
 YOU ARE NOT ON A GREEN POLE YOU SWAP  
 PLACES AND YOU ARE ON.  TIGGY ON THE  
 WHITE LINES IS A GAME WHERE THERE IS A
 COURT AND AGAIN THERE IS SOMEONE ON.  
 WE ALSO PLAY A SKIPPING GAME CALLED   
 LOOPS THAT IS WHERE A PERSON JUMPS IN 
 AND FIRST OF ALL DOES NO SKIPS.  THEN 
 THEY JUMP IN AGAIN AND DO ONE SKIP    
 THEN 2,3,4 AND SO ON, UNTIL YOU CATCH 
 THE ROPE WITH YOUR FOOT AND STOP IT.  
 THEN YOU ARE OUT.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
