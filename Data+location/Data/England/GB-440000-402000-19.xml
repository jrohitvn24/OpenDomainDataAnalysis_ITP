		<content>    Darfield is a very close community 
 and many families have lived here for 
 generations. When asked their reasons 
 for staying people usually said it was
 because the village is friendly and   
 sociable.                             
    The changes that have taken place  
 here have been in the form of improved
 transport and new construction.  In   
 recent years new estates have been    
 built.                                
    Most of the older people in        
 Darfield can remember the coronation  
 and the V E Day celebrations, of      
 street parties.                       
    In general the older residents     
 think there has been an increase in   
 vandalism, also they are aware of a   
 decline in manners, respect for elders
 and property. However despite this    
 they all say they would never consider
 moving.                               </content>
