		<title>05 Crossway Garage, Coleford</title>
		<content>  The owner told us it was built in    
 1963 .    He told us that there was   
 another garage near Crossway, but the 
 petrol tanks were too near the road.  
        He told us what was here before
 the  garage. There was a shed where   
 people made blocks and where they put 
 the coal lorry. Stephen asked him what
 kind of work he did and the owner said
 "Everything concerning cars but not   
 motor bikes because if they fall over 
 they scratch the paint work on the    
 cars next to them".    He told us how 
 many hours a day he works. He works   
 nine and a half hours a day. I asked  
 him how many machines he uses and he  
 said," One lift, two pits, one hoist, 
 one brake tester, one beam setter, and
 some small hand tools, one compresser,
 wheel balancer, and a battery         
 charger".                             
                                       </content>
