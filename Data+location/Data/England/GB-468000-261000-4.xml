 There are 23 pleasantly kept          
bungalows occupied by mainly single    
people over the required age of 65.    
The homes are built in a crescent      
around the Health Centre which         
operates as a Social Centre too.       
                                       
The people are cared for by a Warden   
who makes daily visits. She is a       
qualified nurse, helping with          
surgeries held twice weekly. She keeps 
the necessary drugs, entering details  
about illnesses etc. in a log book.    
She can always be relied upon to       
accompany visits to hospital or        
relatives.                             
                                       
Her daughter, acting as Relief Warden, 
collects pensions and shopping.        
                                       
                                       </content>
