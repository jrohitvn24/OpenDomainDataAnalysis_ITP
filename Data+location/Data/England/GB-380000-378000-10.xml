		<content>  We sent questionnaires to the four   
 churches in our area.They were a      
{Methodist chapel,a Church of England  
{church,a Non-Denominational chapel and
{a Kingdom Hall of the Jehovah's       
{Witnesses.}There are no places        
 of worship for{Catholics, Muslims,Jews
{or Hindus}in this area.               
  None of the churches is ever full    
 except on important festivals such as 
 Harvest Festival or for the Christmas 
 Carol Service which attract the       
 largest congregations. For normal     
 services an average of between 40 and 
 80 people attend. All ages attend the 
 churches which hold between two and   
 four services a week.                 
  The Jehovah's Witnesses did not      
 reply to the questionnaire for        
 religious reasons.
