		<content>   Cambornes parish church is dedicated
 to{St.Martin}&amp; also{St.Meriadocus}who 
 came from Brittany.It is thought that 
{the name Camborne originated from his 
{surname "de Campbon".                 
   The parish church is one of the few 
 old buildings in Camborne.It was      
{restored in 1862}&amp;{made larger in     
{1879.}It retains many historical      
 features like its{14th Century        
{architecture.}The stone altar is of   
 10th Century origin &amp; supposed to be  
 the{oldest of its kind in Cornwall.   
   Other buildings:an 18th Century hall
 at Lower Roswarne situated in the     
 northen region of Camborne.           
   At Magor in{1931 a Roman Villa was  
{discovered,}it is the most westerly in
 Britain and is thought to date from   
 the 2nd Century.The Hut Circles at    
 Caerwynnen Hill are even older than   
 the villa.                            </content>
