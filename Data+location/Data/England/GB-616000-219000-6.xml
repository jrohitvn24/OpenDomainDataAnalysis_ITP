		<title>06THORPE MARKET</title>
		<content>                                       
 There has been a market at Thorpe     
 since the 14th century when a charter 
 allowing a market to be held was drawn
 up. It has been on the present site   
 since the railway came last century.  
 Although it is by the side of the     
 station and the Maltings, it is very  
 quiet. We don't get many trains       
 through nowadays. The Market is only  
 open on Mondays and cars have to park 
 all along the side of the road.       
 There are a great many stalls of all  
 kinds, some of them having covers over
 and some without. These are the ones  
 that are always there and can be hired
 out. Other stalls are only folding    
 tables and some of the people sell    
 things from lorries.In the middle of  
 the market is a pub called King Edward
 VII and it was built in 1901.
