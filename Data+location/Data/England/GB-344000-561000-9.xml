		<title>09Laversdale School</title>
		<content> Laversdale Church of England School   
 was opened in 1865 and the building   
 was used without major alteration     
 until 1952. It then became impossible 
 for the managers and trustees to      
 maintain the school with the money at 
 their disposal.                       
 A great increase in population was    
 said to bring into the school more    
 children than the building could      
 accommodate. (One room of 630 sq.ft.  
 and one of 290 sq.ft.) The building   
 was then out of date and incapable of 
 extension or effective adaptation.    
 Plans were produced for extra         
 buildings of a temporary kind, but the
 school subsequently closed as it could
 not match the new standards being set 
 in the rest of the county.
