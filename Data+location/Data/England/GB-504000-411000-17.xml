		<content> Elsham Wold "Motorway" Industrial     
 and Warehousing Estate is a recent    
 development, occupying a former       
 airfield site, mainly derelict land,  
 surrounded by high grade farmland. It 
 is situated high on the Wolds,offering
 many attractive open views of the sur-
 rounding countryside. The estate has  
 dual carriageway access direct to the 
 Humber Bridge and the sea ports of    
 Hull, Grimsby and Immingham. It is    
 also close to the intersection of two 
 major routes M180/A180 and the A15.   
 It is convenient for access to rail   
 facilities at Barnetby (2 miles) and  
 air facilities at Humberside Airport  
 (4 miles).Elsham Wold Estate therefore
 offers unique opportunities for large 
 scale distributive industries,particu-
 laly those generating large volumes of
 heavy traffic,because of it's relative
 remoteness from centres of popn. conti</content>
