		<title>02Shrimping and Shore</title>
		<content> The best times for shrimping are      
 mid-August to Christmas and from April
 to July. Southport beach is good for  
 shrimping because the water is sandy. 
 Every catch varies in weight: it could
 be 3oz to 5lb depending on the        
 weather. The first stage of shrimping 
 is attaching two large poles to the   
 tractor onto which the nets' ropes are
 fixed. The materials used for the nets
 are Corline twine and wood. After     
 being caught the shrimps are riddled  
 twice, firstly to get rid of the crabs
 and secondly to sort out smaller      
 shrimps. Then they are washed, boiled 
 and shelled. Around 30 people go      
 shrimping in Southport in 1985, but   
 in the early 1900's there were around 
 300 people. The sea wall was built in 
 1965. Southport beach used to be      
 cleaner but now there are a lot of    
 alluvial deposits from the R.Ribble.  </content>
