		<title>13La Rocco Tower (2)</title>
		<content>   The tower was nearly collapsing by  
 the mid 1960s and there was much      
 public concern that this landmark     
 would not only be lost but that the   
 stone debris from it would become     
 scattered across the sandy beach.  In 
 the late 1960s a special offer was    
 made by{Ronez quarries}to repair the  
 damage using their new concrete       
 pumping system.  The total cost was to
 be Â£34000.00.                         
                                       
   The{States of Jersey}agreed to pay  
 Â£17000.00 if the rest were raised by  
 public subscription. In the event the 
 appeal committee that was set up to   
 raise the money from the public       
 succeeded in the remarkably short time
 to{100 days. }
