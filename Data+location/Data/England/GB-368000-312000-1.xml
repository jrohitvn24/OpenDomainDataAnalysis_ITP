		<title>01OVERVIEW,NORTH EAST TELFORD.</title>
		<content> The Wellington-Stafford road running  
 WSW-ENE is the backbone of our area.  
 On either side are older houses and a 
 few shops with newer housing estates  
 on the south side where the ground    
 rises gently. Here there is evidence  
 of old coal and iron works and of the 
 canals and railways that served them. 
 To the north flat farming land can be 
 seen, but a huge area is taken up by  
 the army's Central Ordnance Depot.    
    In the past, immigrants from other 
 parts of Britain have settled in this 
 area,many working in the army Depot or
 the growing New Town.People began     
 arriving from Europe and Asia during  
 the 1950s. They have kept many of     
 their own customs and religions.      
    This is a busy urban area in spite 
 of 20% unemployment.People work and   
 play mainly within Telford but many   
 own a car to take them further afield.</content>
