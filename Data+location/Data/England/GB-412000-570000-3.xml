		<title>03Medburn,a rural hamlet</title>
		<content>     This is a hamlet rather than a    
 village,there being no shop,pub or    
 post-office,and only about 30 houses. 
 In{1922}the original farmland was     
 divided into smallholdings.  The      
 initial dwellings on each plot were   
 surplus First World War Army huts.    
 Today only 1 poultry farmer remains in
 business as a smallholding: most      
 plots now house newly built detached  
 residences for owners who commute to  
 employment or business elsewhere.  One
 owner is starting a livery stable and 
 some rent out land for horses.  A     
 limited bus service runs through      
{Medburn.    }                         
     A local plan sets firm limits on  
 further residential development in    
 reply to residents' concern that the  
 area should retain its rural          
 identity.
