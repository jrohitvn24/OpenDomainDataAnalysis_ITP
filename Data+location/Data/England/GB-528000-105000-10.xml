		<title>10Crazes</title>
		<content> At our school, collections are very   
 popular. A few years ago novelty      
 rubbers were introduced and fanzy     
 stickers followed; now sequins are the
 latest craze. Many people collect     
 them, and the most desired is a large 
 pearly star; the rarest is a small    
 pearly snowflake which has only two   
 duplicates in the school. Then there  
 are the common ones like the small    
 stars. Some sequins are shaped like   
 leaves in all sizes and colours. I    
 have them in pink, purple, orange,    
 gold, silver, green, transparent and  
 red. People swap whenever they can,   
 and go around pleading for giveaways. 
 Whether this craze will survive long I
 don't know, but it is a good one while
 it lasts.
