		<title>02COUNCIL HOUSING IN WHITELEAS</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in this area are 25
 to 30 years old.They were almost all  
 built for the local council,but many  
 tenants have now bought them.They are 
 mainly short terraces of family-sized 
 houses with flats for single people on
 the corners.There are some semi-      
 detached houses chiefly on the main   
 roads.                                
    A few houses were built for owner- 
 occupiers.These are mainly detached   
 and semi-detached houses.There are a  
 lot of bungalows in the area for old  
 people to live in.                    
    Some terraced housing on the estate
 is owned by the National Coal Board.  
 Miners'families live in these.Unlike  
 the other houses in the area,these    
 houses only have a front garden.
