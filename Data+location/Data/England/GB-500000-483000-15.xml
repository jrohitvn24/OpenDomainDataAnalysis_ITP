		<content> Seamer is a dormitory villiage.This   
 means that the majority of inhabitants
 of Seamer do not work there.The pop-  
 ulation of Seamer has changed consid- 
 erably in the past 80 years.The pop-  
 ulation figures are shown below.      
 1901=711. 1911=690. 1921=613. 1931=743
 1941=(2nd World War-no census figures)
 1951=910(1487). 1961=1205. 1971=2841. 
 1981=2988. In 1953 the boundary of    
 Seamer Parish excluded the new East-  
 field estate.The figure in brackets is
 the recorded population of Seamer in- 
 cluding Eastfield in 1951.However the 
 figure of 91O based on the current    
 Parish boundary is a more realistic   
 figure of the population of Seamer at 
 this time.After Eastfield had been    
 excluded from Seamer Parish the pop-  
 ulation increased by 2060 between 1951
 and 1975.
