		<content> FARMS:- HORSEBRIDGE, BROOK, PARK,     
 HOME, LOWER ELDON.  Bought by Sir     
 Thomas Sopwith in 1953, At the time   
 of purchase, the main emphasis on the 
 estate was sport: Pheasants, trout    
 from the Test, and horses.  Now the   
 estate has been re_organised into     
 a commercial concern : it is mainly   
 arable with one dairy herd of 150     
 cows.  The present herd is milked by  
 one man through a herring bone        
 parlour. Home Farm, dated 1912, still 
 shows the standings where the cows    
 were tied and milked by hand.  In the 
 days of hand_milking, one man would   
 milk about ten cows.  In the last two 
 years, six of the work_force from     
 Compton Manor Farms have received     
 "Long Service Awards" (25 years)      
 presented to them at Romsey           
 Agricultural Show.
