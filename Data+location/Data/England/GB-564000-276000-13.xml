		<title>13 FARMING ENGINEERS-WEST ROW</title>
		<content>                                       
    IN A FARMING AREA SUCH AS WEST ROW 
IT IS NO SURPRISE TO FIND A LOCAL FIRM 
SPECIALISING IN AGRICULTURAL ENGINEER- 
ING. W.J.FORD &amp; SONS IS AN OLD FAMILY  
BUSINESS WHICH HAS SERVED THE FARMING  
COMMUNITY HERE FOR MANY YEARS.         
    THE PRESENT OWNER CAN REMEMBER THE 
TIMES WHEN MOST FARMERS SENT ALL THEIR 
REPAIRS TO THE FIRM. NOWADAYS THE      
FARMERS THEMSELVES CAN COPE WITH THE   
MAJORITY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT CROP UP  
OR THEY CAN CONTACT THE MAIN DEALERS.  
THIS LEAVES ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF     
WORK FOR THE LOCAL ENGINEER - OFTEN    
DIFFICULT JOBS THAT THE FARMER DOES    
NOT WANT TO DO.                        
    TO COMBAT THIS DECLINE IN BUSINESS 
THE FIRM UNDERTAKES OTHER WORK, NOTABLY
FOR THE COUNCIL, THE AMERICAN          
AUTHORITIES AND LOCAL BUILDERS.
