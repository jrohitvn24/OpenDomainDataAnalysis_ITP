		<content> The wheelchair in our transport survey
 on page 6 belongs to{Kelly Chapman.}It
 is used so she can get around and move
 up and down. We raised money for it by
 having a sponsored walk, jumble sales 
 and so on. The bulk of the money came 
 from the nearby Barracks.             
  The firm that designed the chair is  
 called Everaids. The actual name of   
 the chair is an Everaid Turbo, built  
 at Papworth Industries 10 miles away. 
  Kelly, aged 8, suffers from spina    
 bifida but the good news is that she  
 is able to come to our school.
