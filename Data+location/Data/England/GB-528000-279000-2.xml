		<title>02PINGLE WOOD CUTTING, WARBOYS</title>
		<content>{Pingle Wood Cutting}used to be part of
 the railway branch line that ran from 
 Somersham to Ramsey. Passenger trains 
 stopped running on the line on 22nd.  
 September, 1930 and even freight      
 services were stopped in 1964. It is  
 now a nature reserve run by the       
 Bedfordshire and Huntingdon           
 Naturalists Trust.                    
 Because it was a railway cut into the 
 side of a hill you go up and down     
 slopes and ramps and steps and into a 
 tunnel.                               
 Many species of wild flowers and      
 grasses can be seen there. In the     
 spring there are violets and          
 bluebells. In summer there are dog    
 roses, ox-eye daisies, pink and white 
 clovers and lords and ladies. There   
 are rarer flowers too, such as Ramsons
 and several types of orchid, like the 
 Early Purple and the Common Spotted.  </content>
