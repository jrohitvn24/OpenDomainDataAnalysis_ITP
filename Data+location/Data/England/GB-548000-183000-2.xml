		<title>02  HOUSING IN DAGENHAM</title>
		<content>   On arrival in Dagenham a visitor    
 invariably becomes lost, simply       
 becauseones first impressions suggest 
 that the town (from{any}direction)    
 looks the same _ namely row upon row  
 of terraced,post 1930 houses. A closer
 inspection will reveal that this is   
 not entirely the case. There are as   
 many as{28 structural differences}    
 between the houses, which pass        
 unrecognised because certain basic    
 designs are re-created throughout the 
 area.                                 
   The houses maintain one common      
 factor _{height,}thus giving the      
 impression of uniformity. Amongst the 
 visible differences are: red          
 brick,pebble dash or wooden facing,   
 shared entrances, and dorma windows.  
   Recent developments include flats   
 and maisonettes for younger families.
