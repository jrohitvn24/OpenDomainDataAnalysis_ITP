		<title>04Youth Theatre (Aldridge)</title>
		<content> This originated as a youth club whose 
 members finally raised enough money to
 build a proper, if small, theatre. The
 local authority allowed them to use   
 the land in Noddy Park Road, but the  
 theatre receives no grant and has to  
 raise all it's money except salaries  
 paid to two youth leaders by the      
 D.E.S.Opened by Bernard Hepton in 1977
 the theatre seats 160 and provides a  
 good community service. The stage is  
 quite large; there are two dressing   
 rooms, props and costume rooms,       
 lighting box, commitee rooms, a foyer 
 with coffee bar and car parking       
 outside. Any one between the ages of  
 11 and 21 may join (though some are   
 younger) and we pay 20p per session.  
 Auditions are held for parts and      
 members have to attend rehearsals. The
 public enjoy the Christmas pantomine  
 most.                                 </content>
