		<title>17The Womens'Institute</title>
		<content> W.I stands for Womens'Institute. It is
 a place where ladies meet to discuss  
 different matters of interest to them.
 It also gives them chance to meet     
 their friends. In an area like ours,  
 it's important, because the houses are
 scattered and that doesn't always give
 you a chance to meet people.          
   The W.I. meets on the first Tuesday 
 of every month. It is mainly held at  
 the Village Hall. They have people    
 round to talk to them about different 
 topics _ for example glass_blowing,   
 cooking and sewing. They also have    
 competitions, for example this year,  
 they have entered the Leek Show, where
 there is a theme of any song title.   
 They have chosen 'Shine on Harvest    
 Moon'. They have to do four different 
 handicrafts and four types of cooking 
 to go with the song.
