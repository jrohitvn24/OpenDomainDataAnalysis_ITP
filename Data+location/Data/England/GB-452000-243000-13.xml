		<title>13Sulgrave Mills</title>
		<content>In the fields to the north of the      
village are the remains of two mills.  
The windmill ceased to function in 1915
and has now been rebuilt as a family   
home.                                  
The watermill ceased to operate in 1919
and is now part of a private house.The 
mill itself is derelict and needs to be
renovated if it is to be saved for the 
future.The water was provided by a     
large mill pond fed by two springs,one 
of which was said to have medicinal    
properties.                            
This year the mill pond and a stone    
barn have been sold for conversion into
a dwelling house for $66,000.The mill  
house,called Mill Hollow has just been 
sold by auction for $80.000.           
The mill ponds are a haven for wild    
life and are regularly visited by      
Beswick and Whooper swans.
