		<content>{Safety of:}                           
   On June 5th. 1985 we analysed the   
 safety of the A1 as it passed through 
 Great Ponton.                         
   We noticed that the road was very   
 busy and noisy.The road surface is    
 reasonably good in this area.The      
 traffic is travelling very quickly    
 through the village most of it nearing
 the speed limit of 70 m.p.h.          
   Particularly dangerous aspects of   
 the road here is that there are no    
 crash barriers  between the           
 carriageways .In addition there are   
 several right lane exits in this area,
 where cars slow down and could cause  
 an accident in doing so.              
   Attitudes to the A1 vary among the  
 residents of Great Ponton.Many think  
 it is very dangerous others believe it
 is convenient for quick travel to     
 towns North and South.                </content>
