		<title>16CHANGES IN CAISTOR SCHOOLS 1</title>
		<content>  A County Council 'Think Tank'visited 
 the area in 1984 to discuss how best  
 to reorganise education in light of   
 falling rolls so that the schools were
 cost effective and maintained a wide, 
 balanced curriculum.Discussions took  
 place between Heads,Governors and     
 staff and there were 2 public meetings
 in the town hall.From a variety of    
 options,some of which suggested       
 closing both secondary schools in     
 Caistor,two were selected for further 
 consideration:                        
   1.Merge the two secondary schools to
 form one{comprehensive school.        
   2.Retain the two schools as at      
 present but with{closer cooperation   
 including sharing a common budget and 
 resources.                            
  There were heated arguments in town  
 regarding which option to adopt.
