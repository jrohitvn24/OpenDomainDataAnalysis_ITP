		<title>15MORETON HALL SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   About 1 mile north from Gobowen lies
 a private{girls boarding school}called
{Moreton Hall.}There are about 310     
 pupils at the moment, but the school  
 is rapidly expanding. To house the    
 growing number of girls a new boarding
 block has recently been built. There  
 are also plans for building a new     
 sports complex because of the great   
 interest in sports. The main school   
 itself is a{listed building.}It used  
 to be a farm and country house, then  
 in 1919 the school moved from Oswestry
 to the present location.              
   Girls come to Moreton Hall from all 
 over the world:Japan,Germany,Holland, 
 Portugal,France,parts of Africa,Middle
 East,United States and Hong           
 Kong.Inevitably they also come from   
 England. There are about 30 day       
 boarders.
