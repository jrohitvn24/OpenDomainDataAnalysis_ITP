		<content>   The most complete record for the    
 region came from Elvaston Castle. Mr. 
 Nick Brown, development officer and   
 Mrs. Pat Brassley, conservation       
 officer for Derbyshire Naturalists    
 Trust, both based Elvaston Castle     
 provided the following information.   
   Brindstone Butterflies are          
 increasing and have done so for the   
 past three to four years. Elvaston is 
 the place where they are most commonly
 seen in the county with nineteen      
 being seen in a group last year. The  
 Gatekeeper Butterfly is now           
 established at Elvaston and the Comma 
 butterfly is increasing.              
   The first confirmed breeding in the 
 county is of a Broad-bodied Chaser,   
 (LIBELLULA DEPRESSA) a dragon-fly came
 from Elvaston in July in 1984.        
   A good range of woodland birds are  
 to be found. No unusual plants seen.  </content>
