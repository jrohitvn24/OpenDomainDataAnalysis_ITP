		<title>07HOUSING IN PULBOROUGH</title>
		<content>  There are 3 main types of housing in 
 Pulborough;timber,brick or stone of   
 pre_Victorian days,Victorian to       
 pre-war and Modern.Most modern housing
 is estate built on land recently owned
 by the Church (Glebelands).           
   A team of 18 men built their own    
 houses pooling their skills.Each man  
 worked 26 hours/week.Each house took  
 2070 hours to build.The 18 houses were
 completed in 18 months.               
           MY HOUSE                    
 My house is an old house.When you turn
 the tap on it sounds as if it is      
 gushing on the floor.My house is made 
 out of a battle ship.Just think a     
 person could have died on that        
 beam.There is a mark on the beam it is
 the date of the house 1714.There is a 
 little secret passage leading from our
 loft to next door's loft. (Martyn).
