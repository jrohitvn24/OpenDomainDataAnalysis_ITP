   In Withernwick there are only two   
 shops now - the Butchers and the Post 
 Office which is also a general store. 
   There are vans that come to the     
 village selling fish,fruit and        
 vegetables, bread and cakes, and      
 ice-cream. The Bread, Fish, Fruit and 
 vegetable vans come once a week, The  
 lce-cream van comes most evenings.    
   In New Ellerby there is also a      
 Post-Office-General Store.            
   Many people in Withernwick, as well 
 as using the village shop, go shopping
  for food to the bigger supermarkets  
 in Hull and Hornsea. We found that the
 most used supermarkets were Asda and  
 Jacksons Grandways.
