		<content> There is a tremendous variety of      
 employment in the area. An interesting
 feature is that most local employers  
 are small or family run               
 businesses.Farming, both mixed and    
 poultry and horticulture in the form  
 of plant nurseries and a mushroom farm
 are found in the area but are         
 discussed in detail elsewhere.Other   
 types of employment are woodturning   
 and joinery at Forton, light          
 engineering on Snapewood Lane,car     
 repairs and petrol sales in various   
 garages along the A6.Agricultural     
 contractors and machinery salesmen    
 also have premises locally.Catering in
 restaurants,cafes and public houses is
 found in and around Scorton.Small     
 shops are found in Scorton or attached
 to the occasional garage.Finally there
 are many people who live in the area  
 but work elsewhere.                   </content>
