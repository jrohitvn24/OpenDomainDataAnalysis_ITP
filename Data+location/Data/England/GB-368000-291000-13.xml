		<title>13A Day in My Life</title>
		<content> On a typical Sunday, I wake up about 8
 a.m. and that leaves me an hour before
 the Church Service is due to begin.   
 The Parish Priest is Father Luczka.   
 After Church, my mother drives my     
 brother Jamie and me home.  Soon after
 Church we go to our horse riding      
 lessons with Mr. Downes.  The lesson  
 lasts for an hour, after which we go  
 home again.  Lunch on Sunday is       
 usually a cold meal like sandwiches   
 etc., then we go up to town to do some
 shopping, mostly food shopping and we 
 usually spend an hour and a half      
 before returning home yet again.  I   
 watch the television programmes for a 
 short while and then go to the kitchen
 to help my mother cook the evening    
 meal.  When the meal is  ready, I call
 Dad and Jamie.  When we have eaten, I 
 have a bath and Jamie follows me and  
 before going to bed, I watch TV.      </content>
