		<title>11WOODSTOCK FIRE STATION</title>
		<content>  The new Woodstock Fire Station stands
near the centre of the town. It was    
built in 1971. The station covers an   
area of six  miles and supports other  
stations over a ten mile radius. In    
1984 they had two hundred emergency    
calls, of these a number have been     
traffic accidents from which they      
rescued a dozen people. They have      
attended a large variety of calls from 
burning chip-pans to warehouses and    
special service calls.                 
  The fire men are on duty all the time
but they also have other jobs. The     
sub-officer Mr Williams works in the   
neaby school as a metalwork teacher.   
The men are called to the station by a 
small alerter. The only way the men are
restricted is that they have to stay   
near the fire station in case there is 
an emergency call.
