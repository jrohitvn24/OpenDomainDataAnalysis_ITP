		<title>01West side of Nidd Valley</title>
		<content> This is a very rural area with a small
 hamlet in one corner. Elsewhere       
 inhabitants are limited to farms. The 
 side of the valley rises to the west  
 and as it rises it shows very definite
 changes. Nearest the bottom of the    
 valley fields are small and bordered  
 by dry stone walls, a feature of the  
 area. Sheep and cattle graze the rough
 grass.                                
 There are a few small woods, mostly   
 coniferous but with a few giving a    
 golden colour in autumn. Several small
 valleys dissect the area &amp; these have 
 some deciduous trees in them forming a
 scattering.                           
 As the hillside rises the grass become
 more tusocky and yellow in colour     
 until eventually higher up the side of
 the valley heather takes over ad open 
                                       
  moorland is apparent. The stone walls</content>
