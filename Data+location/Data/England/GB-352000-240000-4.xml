		<content>    In the 1960's a need for local beds
 for private, independent treatment of 
 illness was expressed and the Nuffield
 Nursing Homes Trust was approached for
 assistance. The Trust agreed to       
 design, build and run the Hospital if 
 a suitable site was found and Â£275,000
 raised locally.                       
    The offer was accepted and work on 
 the project began in 1971.            
    The first patient was admitted in  
 January 1974.  Up to 20 patients are  
 accommodated and the current charges  
 are Â£118 per day, exclusive of theatre
 charges, drugs, dressings or          
 consultants fees.                     
    The Hospital is in a lovely area of
 the City at the top of Aylestone Hill.
 It is surrounded by carefully tended  
 gardens and has its own duck pond.
