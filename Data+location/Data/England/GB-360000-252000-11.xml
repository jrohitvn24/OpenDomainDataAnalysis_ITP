		<title>11Pencombe Fete / 3.</title>
		<content> This year's special attraction is a   
 display of Morris dancing.Many teams  
 from far afield,take part in a        
 colourful dancing display.            
   The day comes to an end at around   
 4:30p.m.When the people leave to      
 return home and the stalls are taken  
 down.                                 
   This year attendance was            
 disappointing,being mainly attributed 
 to the cold,wet summer of 1985.The    
 takings however were in the region of 
 Â£600.                                 
   The fete is organised by the local  
 fete committee,{Mrs.S.Townsend}being  
 in charge.                            
   Half of the money raised is used by 
 Pencombe Church and the remainder is  
 split up for use by the Village Hall  
 and the village Primary School.
