		<content>   The  beauty  of this  stretch of the
 Thames, with  its  distinctive  bridge
 framed by the  Berkshire  Downs on the
 horizon, attracts visitors.           
                                       
   A  caravan  park is  situated on the
 south  bank  of the  river and is open
 all the year round  with six permanent
 residents. The peak period is from mid
 July to  the  end of August during the
 school  summer  holidays.  The  ground
 covers  three  and one half acres  and
 includes  the amenities of an ablution
 block with showers and toilets.       
 Camping  charges  are Â£4 for a caravan
 and Â£3 for a tent per night.          
                                       
   Problems  are  caused by flooding of
 the river, sometimes  by  as much as a
 few  feet.  During  these  periods    
 permanent  residents  have to be moved
 to higher ground.                     </content>
