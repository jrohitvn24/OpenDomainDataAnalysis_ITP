		<title>12FESTIVALS</title>
		<content> There are lots of local festivals and 
 customs in Marston and Hougham.  One  
 of the best festivals is the summer   
 fete which is held every year at the  
 village hall.  There are lots of      
 colourful and bright stalls inside and
 outside.  The games and less serious  
 stalls are set up outside and inside  
 there is flower arranging, art        
 competitions and cake stalls.         
 There is also a village junior        
 marching band which is called  The    
 Bulebirds organised by Mrs. Jill      
 Turner.  They perform at the fete and 
 other events.                         
 Occasionally the church is used for a 
 wedding.  When this happens there is  
 always lots of people attending.
