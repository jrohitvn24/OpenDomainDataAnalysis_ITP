		<title>04My First Impression!</title>
		<content>   When I first came to the village it 
 looked very,very dull.There was no    
 life.No people rushing around,hardly  
 any buses,hardly any bikes,hardly any 
 people about and no towns nearby.     
   I made friends very easily and now I
 am used to the place.                 
   When the Stonehill people were      
 coming home they started to pick on me
 and call me names but I took no       
 notice.                               
   Now I have alot of friends some in  
 Cossington and some in Sileby.        
   There are fields everywhere and     
 farms.                                
   It's a good place for train spotting
 because it's on the main line between 
 Loughborough and London,you get all   
 different types of trains.It's an     
 ideal environment for bird spotting.  
        By
