		<title>04Gt.Addington Church.</title>
		<content>    The church was built in A.D.833,but
the clock was not built at the same    
time.The present clock is the second   
one and is painted gold.The church was 
rebuilt in 1300 and the tower was built
in 1350.There is a Norman arch at the  
front of the porch.                    
    Inside,the alabaster figure is     
Henry Vere in the armour in which he   
fought at the Battle of Bosworth.The   
staircase went to the rood screen which
was made out of wood.It was probably   
destroyed after the Reformation.       
    The trees at the back of the church
are horsechestnut,sycamore,oak,holly   
and alder.At the end of the summer     
thousands of conkers fall on the       
ground.At the front of the church there
are no trees but 40 graves.The church  
has 6 bells which are rung regularly.In
1985 the boundary wall was repaired.
