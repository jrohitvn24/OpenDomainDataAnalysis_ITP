		<title>02Living Around Ore</title>
		<content>           I live in the country near  
 Ore village. I have lived here all my 
 life . There are fields at the back of
 our  house and across the lane . We   
 often go for walks in the woods       
 nearby. We had trouble with a man who 
 wanted to have a caravan park in the  
 woods but he did not succeed. I like  
 living here but I think it would be   
 better if we had a general store      
 nearby ,as it is nearly a mile to the 
 village.I think the area around Ore   
 and Hastings in general is quite a    
 good place to have a holiday but it is
 untidy.Everywhere you go there is     
 litter.{(by  Vicky)                   
 On the Broomgrove  Estate,where       
 I live ,there is smashed glass  from  
 bottles ,sweet wrappers ,and litter   
 from fish and chip shops.
