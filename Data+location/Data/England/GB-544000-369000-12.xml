		<content>{Interview:Mr.and Mrs.E.Smith.         
  Asked about the Dam Close,Mr.Smith   
 said it was an earthworks that had a  
 fence on it to keep cattle in and it  
 probably dated back to Danish times.  
  Willoughby comes from a Danish word  
 meaning "a place by the willows" but  
 it is likely that its origins go back 
 further than the Danes' invasion.     
  Asked about the oldest buildings in  
 the village,Mrs.Smith said the church 
 dated back to the 1400's and was the  
 oldest building.Some of the grave-    
 stones dated back to Saxon times.There
 was another old dwelling where a      
 famous Elizabethan,Capt.John Smith,was
 supposed to have been born.The place  
 is now known as Covell's Farm.Weston's
 farmhouse is also old.
