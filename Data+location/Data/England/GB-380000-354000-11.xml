		<title>11THREE ALSAGER TEENAGERS</title>
		<content> I interviewed three teenagers Matthew,
 Joanne and David. Matthew likes art,  
 fishing and the guitar. His favourite 
 music is reggae. He buys clothes,     
 raggae records and a magazine called  
 Echoes. Joanne likes going to         
 parties, art, reading and classical   
 and pop music. David likes Soft Cell  
 and Siouxsie and the Banshees. He buys
 a magazine called Smash Hits. They    
 all have one pet, Matthew a gerbil,   
 Joanne a duck and David a dog. They   
 like television programmes such as,   
 Brookside, Eastenders and Dallas.     
 Matthew delivers papers, cleans       
 windows and does some labouring to    
 earn money. Joanne babysits and David 
 is on the dole. In September Joanne   
 starts college, David a catering      
 course and Matthew is still at school.
  He goes to bed at 10pm in the week   
 and 11pm at weekends. By R.Broad.     </content>
