		<title>09The School Day Begins. Clair</title>
		<content>A teacher comes out into the playground
and tells us to line up. Then we go in 
to the school row by row. In the       
cloakroom it is hard to do anything    
because people keep pushing and        
shoving. After I've hung up my coat    
and changed my shoes I get my stuff    
from my bag and try to untangle myself 
from the mess in the cloakroom.        
I move into the classroom and get out  
the books that I need. In comes Mrs. W.
our teacher, who calls the register.   
The boys are called out first, followed
by us girls. Then she says "Cardigans  
and pullovers removed and shoes        
removed." We line up for assembly. The 
boys always go in first. If someone is 
showing a play or a song and dance in  
assembly, we try to get to the back of 
the queue because we will then be      
nearer the front in the gym. 15 minutes
later the school day begins.....       </content>
