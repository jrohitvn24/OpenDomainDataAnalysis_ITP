		<title>10A TYPICAL FAMILY SUNDAY</title>
		<content> A typical Sunday means getting up at  
 6.30 a.m.for our family.We have       
 breakfast then prepare a flask of hot 
 cocoa and something to eat. We pick up
 our skate bags and get in the car,    
 leaving at about 8.00 a.m. The journey
 to Bristol is about 25 miles.We get   
 there at about 8.40 and have to wait  
 until 9.00 a.m.My sister and I have a 
 private ice-skating lesson and by the 
 end our feet ache.The rest of the day 
 we spend in the garden and riding our 
 bikes.We play races and chase then we 
 go in to tea. We have toasted cheese  
 sandwiches, bread,butter and          
 fruitcake.After tea we read a book,   
 have a bath and then we go to bed.    
 We go to church sometimes, especially 
 if it is Harvest Festival, Christmas, 
 a Christening or a Wedding.
