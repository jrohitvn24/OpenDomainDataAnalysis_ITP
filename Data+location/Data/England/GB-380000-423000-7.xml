		<content> Rossendale Athletic Club was formed in
 November 1967,following a public      
 meeting convened by Rawtenstall Sports
 Federation.                           
 A running track and pavilion were     
 built at Central Playing Fields,Marl  
 Pits,now the Club's headquarters.     
 The Club's colours are light blue     
 vests with a dark blue/white/dark blue
 diagonal stripe,and the club badge is 
 a stag surrounded by the club name.   
 The club now has a mens and ladies    
 section,the former having renamed to  
 Rossendale Harriers &amp; A.C.            
 The club competes in track &amp; field    
 athletics,road,cross-country and fell 
 racing.                               
 To date the Club's most outstanding   
 runner is international David Lewis,  
 who in 1985 has become the senior     
 National Cross-Country Champion,AAA   
 3000m indoor and AAA 5000m champion.  </content>
