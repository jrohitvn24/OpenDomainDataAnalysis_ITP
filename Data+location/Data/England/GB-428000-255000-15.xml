		<title>15A Typical Weekend.</title>
		<content>  The following are brief accounts of  
 the activities of some children during
 the weekend of 15th.- 16th. June,1985.
  "Quite a lot of people went to the   
 Village Fete, held on the school      
 playing field. There were competetions
 and stalls selling all sorts of things
 many made by the villagers or grown   
 in their gardens. At the end of the   
 afternoon there were running races for
 the children and a barbecue."         
  "We went to the open day at Charlcote
 Water Mill."                          
  "On Saturday there was a gymkhana at 
 Walton Hall, just down the road. I    
 rode my pony in the Bending Race, the 
 Flag Race, the Ride and Run and the   
 Ball and Cane races."                 
  "It was my birthday and for a treat I
 was taken to the Royal International  
 Horse Show. We saw show jumping stars 
 Harvey Smith and his son Robert."     </content>
