		<title>17TRADE AND VILLAGE SHOPS</title>
		<content> THERE IS VERY LITTLE INDUSTRY IN THIS 
 AREA. SPRATTON HAS A GARAGE SITUATED  
 ON THE A5O FROM NORTHAMPTON TO        
 WELFORD. THE MAIN PART OF THE VILLAGE 
 OF SPRATTON CONTAINS THREE SHOPS, A   
 BUTCHERS, A POST OFFICE AND A GROCERS.
 THE BUTCHER IS FAMOUS FOR HIS PATE AND
 DELIVERS MEAT IN A 1O-15 MILE         
 RADIUS.THE FIVE FARMS IN THE AREA     
 SUPPLY MOST OF THE EMPLOYMENT.        
 BROOMHILL, A LARGE COUNTRY HOUSE, HAS 
 RECENTLY BEEN CONVERTED TO A LARGE    
 HOTEL AND EMPLOYS SOME LOCAL LABOUR.  
 THE OCCUPANTS OF THE FEW HOUSES AT    
 HOLDENBY ARE EMPLOYED IN HOLDENBY     
 HOUSE OR ON THE ESTATE.               
 THERE IS NO LONGER A VILLAGE SHOP AT  
 HOLDENBY BUT THEY ARE SERVED BY       
 SEVERAL MOBILE SHOPS. MANY PEOPLE     
 REGULARLY DO A BULK BUY IN NORTHAMPTON
 ON A WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASIS.
