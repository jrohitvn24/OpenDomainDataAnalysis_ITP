		<content>  The M5 motorway from Birmingham to   
 Plymouth, and the M50 to Ross pass    
 through the area, linking at junction 
 8 of the M5. There is access to either
 motorway from the A38 as the M50 joins
 it at Junction 1. The M50 was built in
 1960 and the section of the M5 from   
 Strensham services to junction 8 was  
 completed in 1962. Both are two lane  
 carriageways. Congestion of traffic is
 frequent, particularly in the summer  
 months. There are plans to make the M5
 into three lanes in the late 1980's.  
 The continuation of the M5 from the   
 junction with the M50 has three lanes,
 as it was built at a later date.      
   Motorway maintenance is carried out 
 from Strensham maintenance compound   
 which is situated at the edge of the  
 service area.Motorway police from West
 Mercia patrol the M50 and M5 north    
 of J8 and Gloucestershire south of it.</content>
