		<content> We live in the London Borough of      
 Barking &amp; Dagenham which is in the    
 eastern part of the Greater London    
 Council. The A13 and the A124 (London 
 Road) are the main roads in our area. 
 They carry heavy traffic, being the   
 main roads from London to Tilbury     
 Docks.                                
    Barking Station is large and built 
 of glass and concrete. British Rail   
 trains run to Fenchurch Street Station
 and tube trains to London may be      
 caught here. The station is used by   
 commuters who work in London. Mnay of 
 our parents work there. Of the parents
 of pupils in 4 of our schools about   
 40% work in Barking; 11% in Dagenham; 
 10% in Ilford and 23% in London. Mnay 
 parents are out of work. More parents 
 drive to work than go by bus or train.
