		<title>13Landscaping:Uckfield Bypass.</title>
		<content>   Every effort has been made for the  
 7.3m single carriageway to fit into   
 the landscape with as little disrup-  
 tion to the{countryside}as possible.  
 Trees will be planted to integrate the
 road with the land and match existing 
 woodland. The Ridgewood housing area  
 will be partly{screened}in this way.  
   Wooded areas on either side of the  
 A26 will be extended so that the junc-
 tion and its traffic will have a back-
 ground of trees to reduce the effect  
 of moving traffic.                    
   Ridgewood Farm which has its land   
 split by the Bypass has a cattle creep
 or tunnel. This is not big enough for 
 large farm machinery so they will have
 to go further than before.            
  {Laybys}are planned for each section 
 to allow people to stop and enjoy the 
 scenery. Wild flower seeds have even  
 been used on the slopes by the road.  </content>
