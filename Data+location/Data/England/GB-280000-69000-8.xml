		<title>08DENBURY SCHOOL PLAY</title>
		<content>   On July 3rd &amp; 4th the older children
 of Denbury School did a play called   
{"Kings and Things".}It was about      
 waxwork dummies. All the waxworks were
 historical characters that came to    
 life and spoke about themselves and   
 the times in which they lived.        
   It was a musical play with lots of  
 songs, and parts for the instruments  
 to play. Mrs Fraser taught the music. 
 Miss Gordon was in charge of the      
 costumes which were really lovely.    
   My favourite part was the scene with
 Robin Hood, Maid Marian and King John.
 Mr Stroud,our Headmaster, was Robin   
 Hood and looked very funny with green 
 hair and a love-heart painted on his  
 cheek.                                
   Melanie was Katherine Parr, one of  
 Henry VIII's wives, and outlived him.
