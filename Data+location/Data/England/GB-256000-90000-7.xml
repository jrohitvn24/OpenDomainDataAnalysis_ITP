		<title>07WALKING ON THE NORTH MOOR</title>
		<content> After the sharp climb out of          
 Okehampton on to the moor, through the
 area proposed for the southern by-pass
 route, the moor stands before us. Once
 past moor gate the next buildings     
 southwards are those of Princetown in 
 the middle of the moor. The northern  
 moor provides some good walking, the  
 area being relatively free of the bogs
 and includes a variety of Tors. Once  
 out of sight of the camp and lowland  
 areas one is in true wildscape. On the
 eastern side of the area the loop road
 (see another page) gives easy access  
 for those who do not like the climb up
 to the moor; so occasionally one may  
 come across a car out on the wilds of 
 the moor. There is a great reward for 
 the climb to Yes Tor's rocky summit   
 with, on a clear day, Exmoor and most 
 of N. Devon in view. 'Proper job'!
