		<title>14A Visit to Lathkill Dale</title>
		<content>    When we  went to Lathkill Dale,  we
 went for a walk along  the dale by the
 river. We saw a dabchick and ducks and
 a moorhen. At the edge of the Lathkill
 we  were  looking  across the river at
 something else, and all of a sudden my
 teacher saw a water vole  lying in the
 water as  still as could  be, and then
 it suddenly darted away from us. I saw
 some rabbits on the hillside.         
    There were some weeds called broad-
 leafed pond weed, which were a  lovely
 green.  There  were some water beetles
 and fresh-water  shrimps.   They  were
 wriggling  around  in  the river.   We
 caught some  and brought  them back to
 school. There were lots of waterfalls,
 12 in all, and all of  them were  man-
 made. People made them because fishing
 became popular.  In the  middle of the
 water falls there was a pool where the
 trout swam.                           </content>
