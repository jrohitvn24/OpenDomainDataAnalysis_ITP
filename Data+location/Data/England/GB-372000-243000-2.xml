		<content> MALVERN HILLS   Hang Gliding {        
                                       
 On the Malvern Hills a lot of hang    
 gliding is done. One of our teachers  
 did it but when he tried to land he   
 slipped and hurt his ancle. He was on 
 crutches for weeks.                   
   The Malvern Hills run north and     
 south and the easterly winds blow up  
 and off,that's why it is so good for  
 hang gliding.                         
   The sport may look easy but it is   
 quite hard, I have seen lots crash.   
 Even people that have been hang       
 gliding for five years still crash.   
    Sunday is the day when most hang   
 gliding is done.Up to a dozen people  
 do it on a sunday when it is not      
 raining.                              
    Hang gliders come in lots of       
 colours.
