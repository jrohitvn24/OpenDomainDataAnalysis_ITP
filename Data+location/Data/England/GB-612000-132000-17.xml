		<content>    As the things{Portex}make are all  
 medical supplies, they obviously have 
 to be sterile, therefore the          
 conditions at Portex are different    
 from a normal factory. The people have
 to wear special clothing.             
   The first thing they do is put on a 
 hat and tuck their hair in, then      
 coverings for their shoes and then a  
 long gown gathered at the wrists and  
 neck. They must not wear any make-up, 
 or perfume and no jewellery apart from
 gold rings.                           
    Throughout the 1970's Portex       
 strenghthened its position in world   
 markets and the company's export      
 achievements were recognised by       
 gaining the{Queen' Award for Export   
 three times during that decade. In    
 1979 Portex also won the{Queen's Award
{for Technological Achievement.
