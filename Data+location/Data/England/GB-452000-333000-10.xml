 job looking after three schools in    
 Clifton.The schools are all{Primary   
{Schools}and are all on one campus.    
  He finds that all the people he meets
 in his job are generally nice to      
 him.On the whole the children keep the
 schools tidy but there are a few      
 break-ins and there is a small amount 
 of vandalism.He finds few problems    
 with dogs.                            
  On average he works about nine hours 
 each day,six days a week.He finds     
 there is a lot to do but he enjoys his
 work and feels that the job is        
 secure.He says his pay is alright for 
 the job.

 be done away with and that contractors
 will be brought in to do the work.
