		<content> Each{Sunday morning}at 10.30 a.m.     
 about 70 people meet at the church to 
 worship God and to learn more about   
 Him.   While the adults listen to     
 their message the children leave the  
 service to go to their{Sunday school  
 classes.   On Sunday evening about 20 
 people attend the church.             
 The church is not only used on        
 Sundays.   Monday to Thursday mornings
 the church is used by the village     
{playgroup}and on Thursday evenings    
 there are two young people's clubs.   
 Between 6 p.m. and 7 .30 p.m. 'Focus' 
 provides an opportunity for 6 to 12   
 year olds to play and develop craft   
 skills, while from 7.30 p.m. teenagers
 attend a{youth club.                  
 The Baptist church does not have a    
 full time minister at the moment.   It
  is run by the people who worship at  
 the church.                           </content>
