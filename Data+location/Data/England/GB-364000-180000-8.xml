		<content> Before 1981 there were two infant and 
 two junior schools in Winterbourne.   
 The number of children in the area had
 been falling for some years so St.    
 Michael's C.of E. Juniors joined with 
 St. Michael's Infant School and Elm   
 Park Junior school combined with      
 Greenfields Infant School. One of the 
 Infant school buildings which was over
 100 years old was used by the Ridings 
 High School for a while but now stands
 empty. The more modern building became
 a teachers' centre. Although the new  
 primary schools work very well many   
 people think that it is a pity that a 
 modern infant school building is no   
 longer a school. Now if any parents in
 Winterbourne wanted to send their     
 children to an infant rather than a   
 primary school they would need to     
 travel several kilometres to the      
 nearest one.                          </content>
