 Most homes have a telephone installed.
  There are two public call boxes, at  
 the junction of the A25l with the     
 Throwley road at Leaveland, and on    
 Badlesmere Lees.  It is an irritation 
 that the Canterbury telephone area has
 recently been divided and the boundary
 now runs through the area.  Frequently
 a local number is in the other        
 directory which is supplied only on   
 request to British Telecom at         
 Canterbury.  There are post boxes at  
 the end of Millens Row, Leaveland, at 
 Fisher Street and in the wall of the  
 Badlesmere Stores.  There is a twice  
 daily postal delivery, except Sundays,
 to all houses.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
