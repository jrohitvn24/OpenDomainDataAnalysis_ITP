		<content> I was standing inside the padded      
 cell,and suddenly,Ifelt a shiver go   
 down my spine.Two hundred years       
 ago,insane people had stood in the    
 same place,with strait jackets        
 on.Now,a little sunlight creeps       
 through the broken shutters.Long      
 ago,the cell would have been in pitch 
 darkness.In another cell,there is part
 of an old mattress made of rushes.The 
 door has big studs,and near the top,an
 old grill.This was used to pass the   
 prisoners their food.Down the         
 passage,there is a chapel.Every single
 person had to pray,on Sunday          
 mornings.Upstairs,there is an         
 infirmary.You only went there if you  
 were very,very ill.When I stood       
 there,I felt as though there were     
 prisoners still there,watching me.
