		<title>15THE VILLAGE OF BILLINGTON</title>
		<content>  Billington is a small quiet village  
 about two miles from Leighton Buzzard.
 There are three parts to the village, 
 Little Billington and Great Billington
 which is divided into two parts by a  
 main road.                            
  There are no shops in Billington     
 therefore the people shop in Leighton 
 Buzzard or Dunstable. A bus goes from 
 the village to Leighton Buzzard on    
 market days which are Tuesdays and    
 Saturdays. The Lions Club also provide
 a free bus on Thursdays.              
  Local people seem to be farmers or   
 self employed otherwise they commute  
 to work in nearby towns or London     
 which is about 45 minutes away by     
 train from Leighton Buzzard station.  
  There is  little to do in the        
 evenings other than visit the local   
 pub, the Greyhound, or go to nearby   
 towns.                                </content>
