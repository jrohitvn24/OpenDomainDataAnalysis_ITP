		<title>02A Child's Life in Stithians</title>
		<content>   I am a nine year old boy. I live    
 in a two story detatched house which  
 is over one hundred years old.For     
 breakfast I normally have a bowl of   
 Alpen cereal, an egg and a cup of     
 coffee. My sister and I both go to    
{Stithians School,}the only one in the 
 village. One of my parents drives us  
 to school in our fairly new estate    
 car. I have school dinners which are  
 OK! as long as they don't have melted 
 cheese on. After school I like to     
 program my Electron computer or ride  
 my bike. If I want to see my friends I
 have to cycle but I hate riding back  
 because it's all up hill. I watch a   
 lot of television and my favourite    
 programs are action adventures like   
 "The A Team". I go to bed about 8:30  
 and read fact books until my arms get 
 tired and I fall asleep.
