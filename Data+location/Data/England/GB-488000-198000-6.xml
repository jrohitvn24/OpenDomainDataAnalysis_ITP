		<content>   The cost of houses varies from year 
 to year but the average price of a    
 house in this area in 1985 is Â£70-80, 
 000.Each year between one and two     
 hundred houses are sold. the most     
 expensive sale recently was over      
 Â£440,000.                             
   The houses that most people are     
 looking for in this area are detached,
 with four bedrooms,two bathrooms and a
 double garage,in the price range      
 Â£85-100,000.There are more houses than
 bungalows,but a semi-detached bungalow
 would cost Â£50-60,000.Most houses in  
 the area are privately owned but there
 are a few very small council housing  
 estates.Nearly all houses have good   
 sized gardens.There has not been much 
 development recently,because of the   
 "Green Belt." People choose to live in
 this area as it is rural yet close to 
 London.                               </content>
