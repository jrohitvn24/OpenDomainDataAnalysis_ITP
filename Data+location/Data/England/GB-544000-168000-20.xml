		<title>20British Bulldog-a game</title>
		<content>                                       
Three or more people can play this     
game.One person is "it" or "bulldog".  
There are two homes or bases."Bulldog" 
then shouts,"British Bulldog,one,two,  
three."The idea then is to run from    
one base to the other without being    
caught  by "Bulldog". If "Bulldog"     
catches someone,he has to lift him up  
and say,"British Bulldog               
one,two,three."If the person is too    
heavy then "Bulldog" just has to touch 
him.The person who is caught first is  
"Bulldog" in the next game.If you are  
caught during the game,you are         
instantly  made a "Bulldog",which      
means that you too, try to catch other 
players.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
