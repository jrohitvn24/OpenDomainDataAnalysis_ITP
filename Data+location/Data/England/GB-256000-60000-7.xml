		<title>07THE LEE MOOR AREA-EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Apart from the extraction of china    
 clay there is very little else in the 
 way of employment.The company of      
 English China Clays employs over four 
 hundred people in the Lee Moor area.  
 Many of the workers commute from the  
 surrounding areas,more so now than    
 twenty years ago.This process of      
 change is likely to continue,partly   
 because of the lack of facilities,such
 as schools and shops.There is also the
 company of Watts,Blake,Bearn who also 
 extract china clay at the Headon China
 Clay Works.There is little else ,apart
 from several small farms,a riding     
 stable ,and the post office and shop  
 in Lee Moor village.The company of    
 English China Clays operate a shift   
 system,with shifts covering the       
 morning,afternoon and night.This      
 enables clay to be extracted 24 hours 
 of the day.                           </content>
