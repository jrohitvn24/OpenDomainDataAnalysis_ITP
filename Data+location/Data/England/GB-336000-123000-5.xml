		<content> Mr Woodrow came to the school and     
 talked about Curry Rivel. He is nearly
 70 years old, so he could tell us a   
 lot about the good and the bad days.  
 He told us about Club Day which       
 happened once a year.  There were side
 stalls, merry-go-rounds and other     
 things.   If the children helped put  
 the funfair out they would have a free
 ride in the horse and cart. First of  
 all on Club Day the people marched    
 around the village and then had a     
 drink and after that they went to a   
 church service and fell asleep! Every 
 month they paid a shilling to join the
 Club.                                 
 Curry Rivel School was built  in 1876.
 When Mr Woodrow went to school there  
 were 160 children in the school and   
 the children were up to 14 years old, 
 and then they had to find work.
