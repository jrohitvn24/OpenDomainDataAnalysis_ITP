		<title>16HOMES FOR THE ELDERLY B'BURN</title>
		<content>The elderly in our Domesday Project    
Zone of Blackburn live in widely       
differing environments.                
1} Local Authority Category 1.         
These people live by themselves and are
capable of living independent lives.   
They are visited by relatives or       
friends.                               
2} We also met people who live with    
 heir families.                        
3} L.A. Category 2.                    
We visited two types of sheltered      
housing.One was a private charity with 
flats.They were well furnished with a  
warden on duty connected by            
intercom.The residents cooked for      
themselves but could choose to receive 
"meals on wheels" three times a week. A
laundry room was available and refuse  
rooms on every floor and a lift.There  
was also a communal sitting room.All   
medical facilities are available.      </content>
