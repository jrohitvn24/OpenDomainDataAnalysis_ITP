		<content> The Upton Community have a concern    
 group who produce the Clarion         
 Magazine. It won third prize in       
 1983-85 in the Dorset Village         
 Ventures competition sponsored by     
 Shell. The magazine covers coming     
 events ,news,advertisements for       
 clubs and business in the area. In one
 edition there was an interesting      
 letter from a Mr.Perkins, with his    
 memories of the Village from about 30 
 years ago. He talks about the Lychett 
 railway crossing situated 200 yards   
 east of Upton cross and controlled by 
 a keeper from a signal box called     
 Huberts Hideaway. In the early sixties
 the main railway line through Poole   
 meant the closure of Upton railway on 
 2nd May 1964.Car traffic increased and
 spoilt Upton for him but the by-pass  
 helped relieve the presssure. The old 
 railway siting can still be seen.     </content>
