		<content> At {PANTON,}we are all able to tune in
 to Radio l,2,3 and 4 and have fairly  
 good reception through all wave       
 lengths. We have the benefit of BBC   
 local radion stations, the nearest    
 three being Radio Lincolnshire, Radio 
 Humberside and Radio Nottingham. The  
 television service includes BBC l, BBC
 2, ITV (Yorkshire Television) and ITV 
 Channel 4. Reception is excellent and 
 we have a local landmark in the       
 television transmitter mast at Belmont
 which is five miles away.  Newspapers 
 have to be collected from Wragby or   
 Barkwith and local news is gathered   
 from the "Market Rasen Mail",         
 "Horncastle News" and the "Lincoln    
 Standard" Other local news is gathered
 in the monthly "Wraggoe News" collated
 by the vicar of Wragby or "The        
 Challenge collated by the vicar of    
 East Barkwith.                        </content>
