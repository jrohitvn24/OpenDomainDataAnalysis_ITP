		<title>15ANDREW'S SCHOOL DAY.</title>
		<content>     THE DAY IS MONDAY,I WAKE UP AT    
 SEVEN O'CLOCK, I HAVE A CUP OF TEA    
 THEN I CRAWL INTO MY SCHOOL CLOTHES,AT
 SEVEN THIRTY I WALK DOWN THE STAIRS   
 AND INTO THE KITCHEN FOR MY           
 BREAKFAST,I USUALLY HAVE WEETABIX AND 
 TOAST,  I ALWAYS READ THE PAPER WHILE 
 EATING, I THINK THIS IS VERY          
 CIVILISED.                            
     AT FIVE TO EIGHT I WALK DOWN TO   
 THE BUS STOP IT IS NOT VERY FAR AND IT
 ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES.AT THE BUS   
 STOP I MEET A FEW FRIENDS AND TALK    
 UNTIL THE BUS COMES(ABOUT FIVE PAST   
 EIGHT)I SIT NEAR THE BACK WITH A BOY  
 CALLED 'MARK'.                        
     THE RIDE TO SCHOOL IS ALWAYS      
 UNEVENTFUL AND WHEN WE GET TO SCHOOL  
 WE GO INTO THE PLAY GROUND AND        
 WAIT.WHEN THE BELL GOES WE GO TO OUR  
 FORM ROOM WHICH IS THE BIOLOGY LAB.
