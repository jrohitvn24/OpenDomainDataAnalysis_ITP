		<title>16A DAY AT HOME IN SAMLESBURY</title>
		<content> I get up at 6.30 to help my dad clean 
out the pigs, feed the calves and fetch
in the cows for milking. Then I have my
breakfast of toast and eggs. I take our
dogs a walk next and play with Tess the
puppy.Sometimes I play on my bike or   
help my mum in the greenhouses which is
boring. Sometimes I play with my cousin
before dinner or sometimes I ride on my
horse, Jubilee. After dinner I play    
football or cricket with my dad and Meg
the dog. Then I feed all the dogs,Tess,
Meg and Lady but Lady is a bit greedy. 
All the dogs are black and white.      
  After that I help in the greenhouses 
again and then have another play. Then 
it is doing up time when we scrape the 
pigs off, fetch the cows in and milk   
them and feed the calves.  After I have
had my tea I put Tess, the pup, to bed 
and watch television for a while before
I go to bed myself.        Duncan.     </content>
