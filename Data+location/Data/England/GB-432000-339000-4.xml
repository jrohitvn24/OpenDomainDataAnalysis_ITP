 GENTLY SLOPING LAND OVERLOOKING THE   
 DERWENT VALLEY. UNTIL RECENTLY THE    
 MOST IMPORTANT BRANCH OF THE FARM'S   
 ACTIVITIES WAS THE DAIRY HERD WHICH   
 CONSISTED OF ABOUT 70 FRIESIANS,BUT   
 THIS HAS NOW BEEN SOLD AND REPLACED BY
 A BEEF HERD,MOSTLY FRIESIANS,AND SHEEP
 WHOSE PURPOSE IS MAINLY TO BREED LAMBS
 FOR MEAT. ABOUT 90 ACRES IS DEVOTED TO
 WHEAT AND BARLEY AND A SMALL AREA TO  
 POTATOES. A RECENT DEVELOPMENT IS INTO
 SOFT FRUIT:RASPBERRIES,STRAWBERRIES,  
 BLACKCURRANTS AND GOOSEBERRIES.THESE

 THE INTENTION IS TO EXPAND THIS       
 SECTOR.MOST OF THE FRUIT IS SOLD ON A 
 PICK-YOUR-OWN BASIS.
