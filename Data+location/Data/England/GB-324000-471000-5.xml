 Stable and Mary Macance presented her 
 with an Elizabethan posy of flowers.  
 The Queen watched a team of Maypole   
 dancers with music by Kirsty Lydon and
 Rachel Attwell on violins.            
 Some of Mr. Jepson's and Mrs. Norton's
 class demonstrated the dance "La      
 Volta" (Queen Elizabeth 1 favourite   
 dance).                               
 In the school hall the Queen inspected
 work displayed and spoke to the       
 children. Then the Queen was presented
 with gifts. Mr. Beechem escorted her.
