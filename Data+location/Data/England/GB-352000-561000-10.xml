		<title>10Shopping survey</title>
		<content>  From our survey it was shown that the
 majority of people in the area        
 studied, did most of their general    
 shopping in Brampton, going to        
 Carlisle only for items like          
 furniture, clothes and shoes. On Front
 Street and Main Street there are some 
 54 shops. The majority of shops sell  
 food in one form or another. These    
 include large and small supermarkets, 
 greengrocers, health foods, cakes,    
 fish and chips and a Chinese          
 Take-away. There is a special shop    
 selling hunting, shooting and fishing 
 tackle and another selling window     
 blinds. There is also a shop selling  
 videos and 2 antique shops, clothes,  
 electrial goods and hairdressers.     
 Other services include banks, building
 societies, estate agents, solicitors, 
 accountants and garages. Brampton is  
 therefore a 'self-sufficient' town.   </content>
