		<title>11OLD MIDDLETON CUSTOMS</title>
		<content>{Customs that have died out            
{Mock Mayor Making-}was a custom where 
 ladies chose a stranger dressed in    
 rags to go to every inn on a cart and 
 ask for a drink; if he didn't get it  
 he had a fight. He got very drunk. {  
{Hag Man Heigh-}The Hag man was the    
 woodman and he went round the town on 
 New Years Eve, knocking on doors      
 singing his special song.       {     
{Rush Bearing-}Rushes were built into a
 kind of pyramid on a rush cart that   
 was ornimented at the front and       
 surmounted by a garland, and hauled   
 along by men to the Parish Church. A  
 prize was given for best cart. The    
 rushes were laid on the church floor  
 for warmth.                       {   
{Clog Fights-}Men wore pointed clogs   
 which they used to kick each other    
 until one shouted "Enough!"
