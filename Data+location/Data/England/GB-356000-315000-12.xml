 High Ercall Church is at the end of   
 Church Road. It is quite near to the  
 school. It was built in 1090 and it   
 was restored in 1864_65 after the     
 Civil war. West of the Church there   
 are remains of High Ercall Hall. There
 is a gritty, stoney path leading to   
 the door. The tower is supported by   
 buttresses to stop the tower falling  
 apart. On the edge of the tower there 
 are gargoyles. On the top of the bell 
 tower there are battlements. That is  
 unusual for a Church,because Churches 
 are temples of God. In the Civil War  
 the bell tower was knocked down by a  
 cannon ball. The stone blocks are made
 out of sandstone. There are three     
 clocks. Most of the windows are arched
 with little bars across. Some of the  
 windows are slatted.
