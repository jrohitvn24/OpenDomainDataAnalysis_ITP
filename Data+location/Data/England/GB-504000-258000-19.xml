		<title>19Third London Airport</title>
		<content> In 1968 an event happened which shook 
 the area - it was shortlisted as a    
 site for the  Third London Airport.   
 The site was at R.A.E. Thurleigh. The 
 County Council ensured that District  
 and Parish Councils and the public    
 were aware of the information which   
 was published by the Roskill          
 Commission and also examined the      
 effects an airport at Thurleigh would 
 have on Bedfordshire. All parish      
 councils, the county and district     
 councilsand many voluntary            
 organisations opposed the principle.  
 Barns were painted with the slogan -  
 No Airport at Thurleigh - still       
 visible today. Maplin was chosen in   
 1971, but in 1974 the project was     
 cancelled by the Labour Government.   
 Now Stansted is to be the new airport.
