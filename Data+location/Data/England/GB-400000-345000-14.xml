		<title>14Whiston Village</title>
		<content>  In the village of Whiston there are  
forty-six brick houses, which are      
mostly modern, and there are           
forty-three stone houses.              
  Brook Hollow cottage, one of the     
oldest houses in the village, used to  
be the village shop but now it's a post
office. There used to be a cafe near   
the public house which was the site of 
the blacksmith's forge which was closed
in 1945.                               
  A main road passes through the       
village - the A52. Many lorries pass   
the school from local quarries         
scattering limestone and sand over the 
pavements, when they go too fast. As   
the village is built on high ground the
winters are cold and it usually snows  
heavily, blocking roads. The one in    
six hill out of the Churnet valley is  
dangerous and often gets blocked.      
Sometimes lorries run out control.     </content>
