 households.Some sixty of these consist
 of single pensioners and retired      
 couples.The rest are supported by     
 employment which is found mainly      
 outside the village-namely in Bedford,
 the surrounding area,London or        
 worldwide.Many of these households    
 have two or more adults working.Among 
 the majority who travel away for their
 employment there is a great range of  
 occupations: computing,industrial     
 research,photography,medicine,
