		<content>    There is one church in Caunton,    
 St Andrews Church of England built of 
 stone in the year 1100.               
    Canon William Snow,who is in charge
 of the church,is 71.                  
    He,as vicar of Caunton,has to do   
 burials,weddings,christenings and     
 Sunday services and sometimes special 
 services.Not surprisingly he dosn't   
 like burials.He became a vicar in     
 1939.                                 
    He chose the church because he felt
 that was what God wanted him to do.He 
 likes his job and has been vicar      
 of other places.                      
    Canon Snow has been living at his  
 present home in Caunton for seven     
 years.
