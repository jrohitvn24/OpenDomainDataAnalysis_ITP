		<title>07The Severn Valley Railway</title>
		<content> The Severn Valley line was built      
 between 1858 and 1862 and linked      
 Hartlebury, near Droitwich, with      
 Shrewsbury, a distance of 40 miles    
 away.  The important stations on the  
 route were Bewdley, Arley, Highley,   
 Hampton Loade, Bridgnorth, Coalport,  
 Ironbridge and Berrington.  The line  
 was used mainly for the transport of  
 coal.  It was shipped from Alveley and
 distributed along the line.           
 Unfortunately passenger trains were   
 quite rare and the development of the 
 motor car in the 1930's spelt disaster
 for passenger trains.  The line was   
 closed through lack of trade in 1963, 
 A few passenger services remained from
 Alveley to Kiderminster, but these    
 were discontinued on 1969.  The line  
 was again opened in 1970 from         
 Bridgnorth to Hampton Loade, then     
 later extended to Bewdley.            </content>
