    With the help of the parishoners   
 the house was turned into a           
 presbytery, with a chapel to seat 20  
 people built in the cellar. This      
 chapel was used for daily mass, the   
 school hall being used for Sunday     
 mass.{Father Breandan McDonald,}the   
 curate from St. Joseph's, became the  
 first parish priest and moved into the
 presbytery in September 1975.         
    During the next few years, plans   
 for the purchase of the remaining land
 of the original 2.5 acre site in order
 to build a church and parochial centre
 were put before Cheshire County       
 Council. Permission was granted in    
 1975, and in December 1977, Bishop    
 Grasar officially opened the Â£90,000  
 church and parish centre.
