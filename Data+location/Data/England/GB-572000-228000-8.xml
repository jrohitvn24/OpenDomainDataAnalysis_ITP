		<content>     {Wethersfield Mill}stopped working
 in 1976. It is now the home of the    
{Runacre Family.}The wheel has been    
 blocked off from the river, for in the
 1960's the mill started to fall into  
 the river, which was diverted, the    
 wall strengthened and lock gates      
 installed . What was once a mill, is  
 now a lovely home. This summer Dr     
 Runacre has gone on a 6month exchange 
 with a{New Zealand}doctor so we have  
 his son,{Benjamin Tallon}at{Shalford  
{School}until December.                
                                       
     {Codham Mill}is owned by{Mr D.    
{Tabor}of{Great Codham Hall.}We believe
 that it is rented to an artist. The   
 mill pool is a favourite spot for the 
 local children who often cycle there  
 in the summer.
