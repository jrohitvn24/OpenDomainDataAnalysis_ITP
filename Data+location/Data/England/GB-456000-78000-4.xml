		<content>{Cliff Farm is near Shanklin.}They     
 take 4 beef cattle to the slaughter   
 house a week. Mr.Mew buys about 8     
 beef cattle and fattens them up to    
 take to a show to try and win prizes. 
 For a few months Mr.Mew keeps turkeys 
 to sell for Christmas. Mr.Mew says    
 the worst part are foxes, rooks and   
 dogs. They have got about 300 baby    
 lambs and many sheep. They don't have 
 scarecrows but they hang dead rooks to
 show others that they might get       
 killed. They have 1 horse. Also in    
 their garden they grow fruit.         
 The land is very hilly that's why they
 have sheep. The sheep have to be      
 dipped once at the end of June and    
 September, they stay in the dip for a 
 minute and their head is pushed under 
 three times. The farm is skirted by   
 many footpaths,including the{Worsley  
{Trail. }                              </content>
