		<content> St.Dunstan,Patron Saint of Mayfield   
 Paris Church,is said to have had a    
 forge in Mayfield.Whilst working there
 Dunstan was visited by the Devil in   
 the form of a woman.Seeing a cloven   
 hoof Dunstan seized the Devil by the  
 nose with his red_hot tongs.The       
 Devil,in agony,fled &amp; cooled his nose 
 in the Mayfield iron_spring which is  
 why the water has contained iron ever 
 since.                                
 In November of each year the ghostly  
 figure of a Highwayman,Kit Jarvis,is  
 seen to cross Penny Bridge in         
 Mayfield.Jarvis was also the leader of
 an 18th century band of smugglers in  
 the area,who always evaded capture    
 until November 1750 when he was       
 finally caught &amp; hung.                
 The High Street in Mayfield is haunted
 by a ghostly nun who can be seen      
 walking back &amp; forth across the road. </content>
