		<content> Over the past decade there have been  
 considerable changes in the           
 organization of the schools within our
 area.Because of the falling birthrate,
 not so many schools are needed. This  
 situation has been dealt with in      
 different ways.                       
  In 1986,King Edward Infants and King 
 Edward Junior schools will amalgamate 
 to form King Edward Primary School.   
  Amalgamation means two schools       
 together.There used to be 500 pupils  
 now there are 200 pupils.When the     
 schools join together the staff will  
 work together in one staffroom.       
  The classes  will just stay the same 
 size,because there would just be the  
 normal amount of children when there  
 is an amalgamation.For a transitional 
 period,both school  buildings will be 
 used,eventually the whole school will 
 be taught in one building.            </content>
