		<content>    The Falcon Inn has been a hostlery 
 for travellers for over 300 years.    
    Several stone houses built within  
 half a century of each other indicate 
 an influx of wealth in the mid 16th   
 century, associated with the wool     
 trade from Banbury on the edge of the 
 Cotswolds.                            
    The enclosures award of 1758 set   
 the modern pattern of the parish      
 although the fields have been greatly 
 altered by modern farming methods in  
 the last 20 years. The Lord of the    
 Manor is Earl Spencer.                
    Royalist troops are recorded as    
 being billeted in the village at the  
 time of the Civil War as indeed were  
 servicemen during both World Wars.    
    Master Clockmaker Blencow Churchill
 lived &amp; worked here in the mid 17th   
 century, and Master Chairmaker Edward 
 Gardiner in the mid 19th century.     </content>
