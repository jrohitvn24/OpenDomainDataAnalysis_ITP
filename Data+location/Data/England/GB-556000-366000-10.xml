		<title>10Eastgate Market</title>
		<content> Eastgate Market is at the junction of 
 Sea Lane and Roman Bank.There are 100 
 to 200 stalls depending on what time  
 of the summer season it is.The market 
 is part of a holiday centre and is    
 open on Thursdays,Fridays,Saturdays   
 and Mondays.Some stall holders arrive 
 at 5 a.m. to get a good pitch.The     
 busiest times are Bank Holidays and   
 when the children have broken up from 
 school in August.Many of the traders  
 bring their stalls and stay in        
 caravans for the season on the camp   
 site.Holiday makers mainly buy beach  
 games but there is a choice of food,  
 clothes,ornaments,tools,fishing       
 equipment,kitchen utensils,rugs,etc.  
 Most people come from local caravan   
 sites but some customers come on bus  
 trips from the Midlands.There are free
 buses from Skegness and Chapel St.    
 Leonards.                             </content>
