		<content>   The A.T.C. Headquarters is in an old
 school,which is 100 years old and is  
 situated in Upper Aughton Road.281    
 squadron were formed in 1941 in       
 Linaker School but in 1946 they       
 changed to the school in Upper Aughton
 Road,where the Ministry of Defence    
 leased the building.It has been used  
 as an A.T.C. headquarters ever since. 
   The advantages of using an old      
 school are:the ground outside and the 
 main hall are used for drill and      
 parades.Classrooms are utilised as    
 instruction rooms.Usually A.T.C.      
 buildings are houses but 281 squadron 
 have all the advantages of a big      
 school,so there is lots of ground,and 
 can accomodate lots of cadets.        
   They have lots of equipment,an      
 aeroplane cockpit and other general   
 R.A.F. equipment.Squadron 281 do      
 parades and also can go flying.       </content>
