		<title>07Cottesmore Pathfinders</title>
		<content> We go to Pathfinders every Sunday at  
 10:00am.Maxine,Paul,Christopher and I 
 ride to Pathfinders on our bikes.     
 On Saturday we sometimes go sailing   
 on Rutland Water with the Pathfinders.
 We set off from Cottesmore at about   
 10:00am and arrive at about 10:30am.  
 We then start to rig the boat up then 
 we set sail, the water is quite cold! 
 We learn a lot about God and Jesus.   
 We learn a lot about the path finder  
 as well.When we get there we give in  
 our collection and have prayers.After 
 prayers we talk about God.One week we 
 might do a play about God,another week
 we might just talk about God.We have  
 biscuits and a drink.When you have    
 been in Pathfinders for 10 weeks you  
 get your badge.It has the cross of    
 Saint Andrew,Jesus'cross,the bible,   
 a flame and a rope on it.
