		<title>11BY BUS TO SUTTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{The small village of Sutton can be    
{ reached from Woodbridge four times a 
{ day by a bus service operated by     
{ Bickers of Coddenham Ltd. There is no
{ Sunday or evening service however.   
 The service, the B16, leaves the      
  Turban Centre in Woodbridge and takes
  you through Melton across the railway
  at the newly installed  automatic    
  barrier gates. Melton Halt newly     
  opened this year too, is the nearest 
  station to the village.              
{Crossing the River Deben at the       
{ Milford Bridge, the bus chugs up the 
{ steep hill to the flat plateau of    
{ Sutton Heath.                        
 Along the long straight road passing  
  the Picnic Spot, the bus comes to its
  first stop after Melton Chapel at    
  Sutton Post Office, after a twenty   
  minute ride from Woodbridge.  {
