		<title>14THORNWOOD VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Thornwood village lies on the roas    
 joining Epping and Harlow,on the edge 
 of the old forest land now called     
 Wintry Wood.                          
 Older houses lie scattered about the  
 countryside,or clustered along the    
 road.Small industries-a coachworks,   
 transport and packing firm and        
 tropical fish shop- also lie by the   
 road,or in the new Industrial Estate  
 on the road to North Weald.There is   
 also a sewage works and Council Depot.
 Houses along the busy road have a     
 blighted appearance in comparison with
 the estate half-hidden behind the     
 coachworks where most of the life of  
 the village seems concentrated.       
 Apart from the entertainments offered 
 by the pubs and newsagent, there is no
 post office(closed 8 years) or shop   
 and the road and good bus service draw
 people away from the village.         </content>
