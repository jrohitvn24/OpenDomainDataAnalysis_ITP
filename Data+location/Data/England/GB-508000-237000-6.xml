		<title>06DAIRY FARMING IN CLOPHILL</title>
		<content>  At{Pedley Wood Farm}we visited a     
 dairy herd of 50{Pedigree Jerseys.}The
 cows are milked twice a day by machine
 in the milking parlour and are fed    
 with their ration of cattle pellets   
 according to their milking record. The
 milk is then pumped into an ice-cold  
 stainless steel tank and{450 litres   
 are collected daily by a tanker. This 
 is then tested, treated and bottled at
{Hunstanton}before being delivered     
 next morning on our doorsteps.        
  Calves are taken from their Mothers  
 after 36 hours and are hand reared.   
 They can produce calves themselves at 
 2 years old. The cattle eat grass in  
 summer but live in barns during winter
 when they eat silage &amp; barley straw,  
 both produced on the farm.            
  The new{milk quota}allocated is too  
 low so this herd will soon be sold &amp;  
 there will soon be no dairying here.  </content>
