		<content>    In present day W.Chiltington there 
 is a mixture of privately owned and   
 council houses, and flats for old     
 people.There are 907 private homes and
 bungalows and a big old house         
 converted into 4 flats. There are 46  
 council homes on two small estates and
 28 flats built in 2 storeys only, for 
 old people. There are no high rise    
 flats.                                
   Some houses are still being built,  
 mostly of brick, some are tile-hung   
{Sussex-style}with tiled roofs. Some   
 are made to look old with plaster on  
 the outside, hollow beams and thatched
 roofs,but were only built 60 years ago
   There are some very old houses,     
 timber framed with wattle and daub    
 fill that date back to the 15th       
 century. Most of these were originally
 farm cottages on the original freehold
 and copyhold farms in the old manors. </content>
