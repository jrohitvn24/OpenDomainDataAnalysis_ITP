		<content> Edgoake Lane is a lovely old fashioned
 road just off the main road,it        
 consists of many attractive houses    
 but,the main attraction must be an old
 black and white building called       
 'Greensleeves'.At the front of the    
 house is a beautiful lawn with        
 saddle stones surrounding it and on   
 the inside of the lawn is a wooden    
 wheelbarrow with many flowers planted 
 in it.Being a 15th century building it
 does need slight repairs done to it,  
 but is quite well preserved for its   
 age.This house has many little        
 attatchments which might not catch    
 your eye at first glance,like on the  
 door is a large iron chain which rings
 the bell and just below that is an    
 18th century pump which used to pump  
 water for villagers.Other details that
 are around the house are a well and a 
 small building for the gardeners.     </content>
