		<content> There are two Jewish Communities in   
 Bournemouth, the Reform and Orthodox. 
 The Orthodox has about 800 members and
 the Reform about 400 members. The     
 Orthodox which I belong to is three   
 quarters retired people, the rest are 
 aged 30 and under. The Reform is      
 mainly made up of young people as it  
 does not keep all the customs the     
 Orthodox carries out, ie not driving  
 to the synagogue on shabbat or keep   
 separate pots for meat and milk       
 dishes. Another custom of the orthodox
 is that the men and women do not sit  
 together in the synagogue and the     
 Reformists do not carry this out.     
  There are two Jewish cemetries,one   
 at Kinson and one at Moordown. There  
 is a Jewish home called the Hannah    
 Levy home which houses about fifteen  
 people and one for the blind called   
 the Dolly Ross home. A. DAVIDSON.     </content>
