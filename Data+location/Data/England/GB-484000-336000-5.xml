		<title>05The View from Class 5 Window</title>
		<content> The general view from Class Five      
 window consists of different buildings
 of various shapes and sizes.The land  
 usage is more farmland than anything  
 else.On a clear day you can see       
 Lincoln Cathedral or even the power   
 station on the River Trent.You can    
 plainly see the A1 dual carriageway   
 and the A52 running from Grantham to  
 Nottingham.There are pylons           
 obstructing the view,but they don't   
 obstruct it too much.You can sometimes
 see the occasional train in the       
 distance,but I don't see much outside 
 the window because I'm usually        
 concentrating on my work.The trees are
 quite interesting,oak is quite common.
 This beautiful countryside to me,has a
 kind of magic about it.I think we are 
 very lucky to have such a view from   
 our classroom.
