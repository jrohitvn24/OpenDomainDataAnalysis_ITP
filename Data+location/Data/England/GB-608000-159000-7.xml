		<title>07Wood Ants in Blean Woods</title>
		<content> Blean Woods are the home for our      
 largest native ant FORMICA RUFA and   
 their enormous nests can be seen and  
 avoided.  The nests can be as much as 
 six feet across and several feet high.
                                       
                                       
 If the ants are disturbed for example 
 by throwing a stick on the nest, the  
 noise of rustling bodies and the      
 tremendous activity can be quite      
 frightening.  Needless to say, small  
 boys love doing this.                 
                                       
 The ants are up to 1/2 inch long and a
 bite can be very painful.  They do a  
 useful job in the woodland, beaking   
 down waste branches, leaves and dead  
 creatures.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
