		<title>14Cheese Making.</title>
		<content> Making {Cheshire Cheese }is quite a   
 complicated process.It used to be done
 on the farms, but now it is made in   
 special factories. First,milk is      
 heated to 71  degrees centigrade to   
 pasteurise it. Then special bacteria  
 are added and the milk is cooled . The
 milk now begins to get lumpy and turns
 into{curds and whey}.The {curds}are   
 separated from the {whey}and the {whey
 is taken away to use as pig food.The {
{curds }are mixed with a bit of salt   
 and then they are pressed in big      
 moulds that are lined with cheese     
 clothes. Very heavy weights are used  
 to press the cheese into shape. After 
 it is pressed it is wrapped in plastic
 and then stored for a couple of weeks.
 Nowdays our local farms produce milk  
 for more modern types of cheese such  
 as {Lymeswold.}
