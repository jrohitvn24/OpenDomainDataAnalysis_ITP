		<content> Sunday morning 7am-I was excited,in 4 
 hours time I was going to my fishing{ 
{match.}There were 80 people in it and 
 it was very important to me.Time I was
 dressed.I went down stairs got my{    
{fishing}equipment together and cleaned
 it.I cleaned my rod and put it in the 
 car ready for my dad to take me to the
 match on the{canal.}I went back to bed
 .10-30am By this time I was at the    
 match with my rod set up and my bait  
 fresh.11-00am and the whistle blew    
 which allowed me to cast my line into 
 the water and after 10 minutes I got a
 bite,a roach.I was very pleased.I had 
 a good swim going,one minute to go and
 I had a bream on,ten seconds to go-I  
 got it out and put it in my keep net  
 just in time.By the time I got in I   
 was very tired.I told my mum I came   
 second and the went to bed.
