		<title>17Glassmaking in Kirk Sandall.</title>
		<content>                                       
 There are two large glass-making      
 factories in the area of the Block -  
 Rockware and Pilkingtons.{Rockware}   
 are concerned with making glass jars  
 and bottles. They make two different  
 types of glass -{flint glass}which is 
 clear for things like milk bottles,   
 and{opal glass}which is a white glass.
 In the factory there are three flint  
 furnaces and two opal. Bottles start  
 off in the "hot end" of the factory   
 and are then taken to the decorating  
 department where advertisements can be
 painted onto bottles by machine. From 
 there they are packed and sent to     
 various dairies. {Pilkingtons}polish a
 different type of glass -{plate glass}
 - which is used as window or safety   
 glass. Local sand is one of the raw   
 materials used, which is obtained from
 just outside this Block.              </content>
