		<title>12MY DAY AT SCHOOL-TIM PRESTON</title>
		<content> OUR DAY - First I get up at 7.00a.m.  
 then I get dressed and after that I   
 have breakfast and I have honeysmacks.
 At halfpast eight I go down to the bus
 stop and wait at the bus stop for the 
 coach and we get on it and  go to     
 school and when we get to school we   
 have assembly and we sing our carols  
 for our Christmas Play. Then we get   
 our reading books out then we have our
 milk in cartons and go out to play and
 at playtime we like playing "IT". Then
 we come in and do some work. We do    
 Maths,I like that best of all. After  
 that we go to the toilet and wash our 
 hands and then we eat our dinner.After
 that we go and play for a long time.  
 Then the bus comes to pick the third  
 years and the fourth years for swimm- 
 ing. Then we come back to school.     
 Then we go home on the bus. - by Tim  
 Preston,age 7, of Wreningham School.  </content>
