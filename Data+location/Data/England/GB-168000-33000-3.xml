		<title>03PORKELLIS Crnwll -Population</title>
		<content> With a population of less than 200    
 PORKELLIS is a typical small Cornish  
 community in decline. With no industry
 of any size and small family farms    
 providing little prospect of          
 employment it is not surprising that  
 the young people are leaving to find  
 work elsewhere. Even the once strong  
 religious spirit within the community 
 is in decline, with the Church Of     
 England chapel in PORKELLIS having    
 closed. The majority of the population
 were born in the area, or within a    
 25Km radius, although a number of the 
 larger cottages and houses have been  
 bought by people not of Cornish origin
 either as retirement homes or to run  
 as bed and breakfast accomodation.
