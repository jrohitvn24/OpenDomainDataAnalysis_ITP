		<content>  The only village of some size is     
 Shipham, which means place or         
 enclosure for sheep.  Many of         
 Shipham's fields are used for sheep   
 grazing.  Shipham is set in so quiet a
 hollow of the Mendips that it is      
 difficult to believe that about one   
 hundred and fifty years ago it had the
 reputation of being the toughest of   
 all mining villages in the landscape. 
  The lead mining and digging for      
 calamine has long since ceased;  today
 the chief occupation after farming is 
 probably quarrying. A  mile beyond    
 Shipham there are two large limestone 
 quarries, but they are just outside   
 our block.  We experience the         
 trundling Quarry lorries travelling   
 through Shipham.                      
  Around Shipham are patches of "gruffy
 ground", caused by mine shafts, now an
 ideal place for rabbits and sheep .   </content>
