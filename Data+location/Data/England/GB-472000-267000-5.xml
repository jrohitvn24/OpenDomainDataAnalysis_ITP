		<content> WITH A CURRENT MEMBERSHIP OF          
 APPROXIMATELY 500, THE SAILING CLUB IS
 A THRIVING ORGANISATION WHICH WAS     
 FORMED ALMOST AS SOON AS THE RESERVOIR
 WAS COMPLETED. IT PROVIDES SAILING AND
 RESCUE FACILITIES FROM EASTER UNTIL   
 NOVEMBER AND BOATS ARE LAID-UP FOR THE
 WINTER MONTHS. THE CLUB DOES NOT      
 ACTUALLY OWN ANY BOATS - THEY ARE ALL 
 OWNED BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS.          
 RACES ARE REGULARLY ORGANISED FOR THE 
 VARIOUS CLASSES OF BOATS OVER A SET   
 COURSE. PRIZES ARE AWARDED AT THE     
 ANNUAL LAYING-UP DINNER IN NOVEMBER.  
 TYPES OF BOATS USED ON THIS RESERVOIR 
 INCLUDE GENERAL PURPOSE (14'),OPTIMIST
 (7'),ENTERPRISE (13'), FIREBALL (16'),
 THE 5 0 5 (16') AND THE FLYING FIFTEEN
 WHICH IS 20' OVERALL LENGTH BUT ONLY  
 15' AT THE WATER LINE - THIS BOAT IS  
 RATHER EXPENSIVE BUT HAS A REPUTATION 
 AS THE BEST PERFORMER IN ITS CLASS.   </content>
