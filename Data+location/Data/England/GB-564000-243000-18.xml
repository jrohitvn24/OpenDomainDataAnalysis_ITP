		<content>1. Estate facts: built 1975, 3x daily  
bus service, P.O.delivery 2x daily, 1  
shop (Mace). There is a lovers' alley  
surrounded by pink roses, graffiti and 
broken glass.  Teenagers meet there.   
People say there are gangs but you     
don't notice them. The Estate was built
for the London overspill. There are    
three or four subways leading to       
nowhere because the estate was not     
finished because the money ran out.    
2.Interviews with residents: most      
people said they liked it on the       
estate because it was peaceful and     
away from the town. 3.Housing: most    
houses are the same. The roofs are     
made of tiles,  the walls are made out 
of brick,  cement rendering and  pebble
dash.Each house has one toilet,  3     
bedrooms,  a kitchen,  a living room,  
small garden.There are open spaces     
between each row of houses.            </content>
