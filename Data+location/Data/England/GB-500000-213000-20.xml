 The toilets wer outside in 2 blocks - 
 one for boys and one for girls. They  
 had no flush and had to be emptied    
 every so often b;y the "sewerage men".
 The playground must have been one of  
 the best in the country -  the whole  
 of the common. It was great fun in the
 winter, almost everyone brought       
 sledges to school to use at playtime. 
 Those who stayed for school lunches   
 had to walk in indian file down to the
 Village Hall where lunches were       
 brought in containers by the dinner   
 van. B Thorne
