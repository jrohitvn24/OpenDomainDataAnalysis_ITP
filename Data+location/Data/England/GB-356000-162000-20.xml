		<title>20The Women's Institute Market</title>
		<content> The W.I. market is held on Friday     
 mornings from 10-11a.m. in the Old    
 Schoolroom.Stalls are set up which    
 sell produce that is homegrown or     
 homemade,the standard of craftwork on 
 sale being very high.                 
 Keen purchasers arrive early and      
 jostle for choice consumables,browsers
 arriving a little later when the      
 hubbub is a little less frantic.      
 Woodwork,pottery and even hand        
 engraved glass are for sale.Household 
 items such as pillow-slips,tea-cosies,
 cot covers,pot-holders and table      
 cloths are amongst the sewing and     
 knitting that may be found.           
 Homegrown vegetables on sale this July
 included lettuces and cucumbers.Cakes 
 and biscuits sold quickly and for     
 those finishing their buying there was
 a refreshing cup of tea.
