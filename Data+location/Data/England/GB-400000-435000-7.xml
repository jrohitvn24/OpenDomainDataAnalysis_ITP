 and go down to breakfast.I usually    
 have a fruit juice,toast and          
 coffee.After breakfast I walk to      
 school.I play for ten minutes.When the
 bell rings I go into school.We do     
 Handwriting until breaktime.The next  
 lesson is Painting.I have my dinner at
 school.In the afternoon we have Maths 
 and English. There is a short break   
 between lessons.I walk home at 2.45   
 p.m. I usually watch television until 
 tea is ready.After a tea of biscuits  
 and buns ,I change into my old clothes
 and go out to play with the friends   
 who live near to my house.My best     
 friend is Rebecca.She goes to the same
 school but lives in{Haworth.}For      
 supper I have a drink of lemonade and 
 a piece of cake.I help to wash the    
 dishes.I say my prayers and go to bed.
