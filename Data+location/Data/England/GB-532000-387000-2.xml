		<title>02Louth Markets</title>
		<content> Louth is mentioned in guide books as  
 being one of the best market towns in 
 England.People come from surrounding  
 towns and villages to visit the       
 markets.There is the cattle,the       
 outdoor and indoor markets.The cattle 
 market began in 1750.It opens on      
 Friday mornings in the spring and     
 autumn and sells around 1000 animals a
 day.It deals with cattle,pigs and     
 sheep.Both markets are in operation   
 on Wednesdays,Fridays and Saturdays.  
 The market hall was built in 1806.The 
 beginning of the outdoor market is    
 unknown to us but it is very likely   
 that Louth grew up as a centre for    
 bartering.The main features of the    
 markets are the characters who can be 
 seen there buying or selling and a    
 chance to talk to these people can be 
 an experience.Some say, "If you alter 
 Louth market you will kill Louth".    </content>
