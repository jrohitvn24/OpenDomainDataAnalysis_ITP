		<content>{A Mixed Farm-New Common Farm-MARTON   
 The farm covers 150 acres, but is on  
 split sites.This is because the farmer
 has expanded his farm and purchased   
 extra land (along with milk quotas)   
 where it was available. Twenty acres  
 each year is given over to growing    
 potatoes, seventy-five acres is       
 devoted to a grass crop and the rest  
 is rough grazing for 145 dairy cattle.
   Potato growing is expensive as      
 machinery and harvesting not to       
 mention fertilizer,costs a great deal.
 Therefore, the acreage and production 
 must be maintained to keep it economic
   The potatoes are graded and bagged  
 at the farm and then sold in bulk to a
 co-operative. The largest crop on the 
 farm is grass in the form of silage.  
 The machinery for this is not         
 expensive, but soil quality still     
 needs to be high.                     </content>
