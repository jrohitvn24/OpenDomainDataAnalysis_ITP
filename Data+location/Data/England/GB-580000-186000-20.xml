		<title>20A Day in Our Lives.</title>
		<content>  We are eleven years old and attend   
 Hadleigh Junior School. Some of us    
 came to school by car but most of us  
 walked. Those who have passed their   
 Cycling proficiency test are allowed  
 to ride on their bikes. The morning   
 bell rings at 8.55a.m. and we have    
 lessons until Assembly at 10.25a.m.   
 Then it's playtime and we rush out to 
 eat our crisps and play'Bulldog' or to
 stand and chat.At lunch time we eat   
 our school dinner or packed lunches in
 the hall.You should see the new       
 curtains:they are bright red and white
 stripes!We raised the money to buy    
 them by holding a'sponsored spell'.The
 whole school was re-painted last term:
 the smell was terrible but it looks   
 bright and cheerful now.Our classroom 
 has a yellow ceiling,pale beige walls 
 and red radiators. In September we    
 shall be starting at King John/Deanes.</content>
