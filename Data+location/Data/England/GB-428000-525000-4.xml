He does not have dogs or horses to help
him. This year 19 lambs were born. The 
fleece from one sheep can weigh 3kg.   
This year 75 calves were born. Their   
two pigs had piglets this year. In     
Winter the animals are kept inside and 
have to be fed. The farmer grows Spring
and Autumn corn to feed the animals in 
Winter. He repairs buildings and       
machines all through the year. In      
Winter it is very hard for him to feed 
the animals and clean the barns. In    
Summer he spends the day cutting grass,
making hay and cutting corn. The farmer
has to buy fuel, fertilizer, machinery,
some feed and chickens. He sells milk, 
eggs, beef and corn. One cow can give  
1000 litres of milk a day. The milk is 
sent to th dairy at Stone Bridge,      
Durham.                                </content>
