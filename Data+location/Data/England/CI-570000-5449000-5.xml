		<content>    We arrive now in the{Middle Ward.  
 Facing southwards we come to the Iron 
 Age rampart, then in the same ward we 
 enter the quaint{St. George's Chapel,}
 built in the 13th century, with its   
 uneven floor and four squat pillars   
 reaching for the low ceiling. On the  
 left as you enter you see a solid     
 stone altar with five crosses engraved
 on the granite top, representing the  
 five wounds of Christ.                
    Out of the Chapel and plodding on  
 up the granite steps we pass the      
 mighty{Somerset Tower,}built to       
 defend the old{Keep}when cannon       
 became a menace, and then we arrive at
 the well, where a stone has to drop 57
 feet through the depths to the fresh  
 water at the bottom. It was originally
 open to the sky, but was roofed over  
 in the 17th century.
