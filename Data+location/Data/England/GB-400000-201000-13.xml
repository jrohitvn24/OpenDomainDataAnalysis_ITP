		<title>13CIRENCESTER LIBRARY</title>
		<content> This library is the only one in       
 Cirencester. It is a friendly,        
 peaceful and quiet place. Most people 
 like to read fiction. There is mostly 
 fiction books in the library. There is
 a childrens library upstairs and less 
 books are up there. There are 3,000   
 books altogether. They have films for 
 children and puppet shows and stories.
 You cannot bring dogs inside. If you  
 get a ticket you can also borrow      
 cassettes and videos.People go there  
 in their spare time to read,          
 especially during the Winter. We met  
 Mrs Thompson, the librarian, who said 
 that the books cost between Â£10 and   
 Â£100. Two and a half people work in   
 the library and 2,600 children and    
 9,000 adults have joined. The library 
 also keeps newspapers and local       
 information that people might need.
