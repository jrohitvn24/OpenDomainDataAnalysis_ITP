		<content>{Cornwall is a popular place}for       
 artists.Its the light that is right   
 for painting and if you go anywhere in
 Cornwall its usually quiet and        
 peacefull and is not dusty.           
 But there are not many artists in St. 
 Merryn.We interviewed{Mrs Bourdeaux}a 
 local artist about her paintings.She  
 is married with 3 children and has    
 lived locally for about 14 years.She  
 began to paint commercially in 1975   
{.She sells}her paintings in the       
 Newsagent's in the St.Merryn village  
 and at Mid-Cornwall Galleries in Par. 
 Mrs Bourdeaux uses{water colours and  
{acrylic paints}to paint{wildlife.     
  She has time to paint in the         
 mornings and evenings when her        
 children aren't with her.
