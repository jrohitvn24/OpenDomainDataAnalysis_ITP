		<title>03APPLEBY MAGNA VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  Our village is called{Appleby Magna. 
 We did a survey of the families at our
 school and we found that nearly twice 
 as many people work out of the village
 as they do in the village.The village 
 has{two shops}one is a small food shop
 and the other is a post office and a  
 food shop.We have two pubs,one called 
 the{'Black Horse'}and the other is    
 called the{'Crown'.}We have four phone
 boxes in and around the village. In   
 Appleby there are{two butchers.}Also  
 we have{three coal merchants}but the  
 neighbouring larger village of Measham
 hasn't got any.Near Bowleys lane is a 
 large open space called the recreation
 ground on which people can play games.
   In addition to the farms there are {
{two transport firms.}The largest,     
 Fowkes &amp; Son, carry mainly bricks.    
  The{population}of Appleby Magna is   
{1040}adults and children.             </content>
