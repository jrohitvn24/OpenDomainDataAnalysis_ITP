		<title>11BROADWAY CENTRE (2)</title>
		<content>  On the ground floor there are shops  
 along the Broadway frontage and down  
 the central shopping mall.  In total, 
 there are 51 shops, some large stores 
 like Marks and Spencers and           
 Woolworths, while others are smaller  
 units.                                
                                       
 Lifts take shoppers to the second and 
 third floor car parks.  People using  
 the Centre were asked what they liked 
 or dis-liked about it.  The dis-likes 
 were few, the main being the lack od  
 adequate parking space on Saturdays.  
 The good points were many covering;   
 the range of good shops, covered      
 shopping making life easier, freedom  
 from traffic, bus services to the door
 and the Centre being well run and     
 regularly cleaned.
