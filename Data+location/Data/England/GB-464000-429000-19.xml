		<content> Mr Edward Stables remembers the corn  
 mill working down Mill Lane.          
     I remember the carts of grain     
 passing the old pub and one particular
 windy day, the sails blew off the     
 mill.                                 
 At the clay workings in 1929 bricks   
 were made by hand and in later years  
 land drainage tiles were made.        
 I remember the Zeppelin raids of      
 1914/18 and a nearby barn's slate roof
 shattered by a hail of brass balls.   
 In the second world war German        
 prisoners were brought from Howden to 
 work on the farm.                     
 The children asked me what was the    
 best day in my life and I couldn't    
 think of anything to tell them. After 
 they'd gone I thought about it and    
 decided the best day of my life was   
 the day I threw my cigarettes away.
