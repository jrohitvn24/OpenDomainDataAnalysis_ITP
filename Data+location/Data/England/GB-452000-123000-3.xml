		<title>03PHEASANT SHOOTING</title>
		<content>    All the pheasant shooting in       
 Durwood is done by Mr Levitch. When   
 they are shot they are taken to be    
 sold. The pheasants are reared in the 
 middle of the wood. They let them grow
 to a good size and then let them out, 
 beat them out of the trees, shoot the 
 birds, and then sell them. The        
 pheasant shooting season is October   
 1st to February 1st. There are twenty 
 two Saturdays in the pheasant shooting
 season.                               
    The pheasants are reared by        
 Mr.L.Gould. You have to pay Â£2.50 for 
 each brace of pheasants shot. When the
 pheasants are shot they are kept in a 
 stone building which can hold about   
 4000 pheasants.                       
    The shooters have to pay for the   
 pheasants' food and also contribute to
 the Â£9.00 a day paid to the beaters.
