		<title>10LIFE ON A FARM, NESSCLIFFE</title>
		<content> Our farm is quite small, about 3      
 acres so we only have four cows. There
 are four sheds where the calves go.   
 The cows go in when it is time for the
 calves to have their milk.  We have   
 forty lambs, 25 ewes and one ram.  Our
 sheep dog is not trained to round the 
 sheep so he is tied up to a chain.    
 Each year the sheep go to be sheared  
 and dipped.  Our class went to see the
 shearing.                             
      By the gate going into the field 
 there is a big oak tree. It's where I 
 play on my rope ladder.  It's possible
 to climb up the tree and climb down   
 the rope ladder.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
