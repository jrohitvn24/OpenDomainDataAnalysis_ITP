		<content>      To the east of the area lie      
 Redhill Common(300 acres)which rises  
 to 150 metres above sea level giving  
 fine views to the North Downs,south to
 Leith Hill and over Redhill,and Earls-
 wood Common(52 acres), favourite camp-
 ing ground for "Travelling People."   
 Redhill Common and Earlswood Common   
 are separated by the graceful spire of
 St. John's Church,and were originally 
 quarried for road-mending stone.Be-   
 tween Earlswood Common and Petridge   
 Wood Common lie the sewage works and  
 rubbish dump with its sophisticated   
 but inoperable capital equipment!     
      In the north east corner of the  
 area lie Reigate Park and Reigate     
 Priory together covering 155 acres.   
 There is a large lake with water fowl.
 There are fine views from the ridge   
 known as Park Hill which has a reser- 
 voir at the east end.                 </content>
