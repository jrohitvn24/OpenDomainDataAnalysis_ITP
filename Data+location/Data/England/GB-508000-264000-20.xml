		<title>20INTERVIEW _ RECTOR</title>
		<content>   {The Rector}was ordained five years 
 ago. He lives in the vicarage at Dean;
 he serves six churches and is assisted
 by a part-time deaconess. His aim is  
 to maintain a modern approach to      
 religion in order to attract more     
 young people to his congregation.     
    There are 210 parishoners and 60   
 regular church goers. The majority of 
 young people still marry in the       
 church. There is a Sunday School and  
 Club for the younger children and a   
 family service is held each month.    
    The Rector said he hoped to raise  
 cash to buy a mini-bus in order to    
 transport the teenagers on outings.   
    The form of service adopted in the 
 Church is the Ancient and Modern New  
 Standard with the Common Prayer.
