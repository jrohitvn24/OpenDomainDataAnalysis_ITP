		<title>06DAIRY FARMING ROUND BOLAM</title>
		<content> In the area South of West Auckland    
 near{Bolam,}the main milking cows are 
{Holstiens}and{Friesians.}These cows   
 cost between Â£450-Â£800.They are milked
 twice daily and are fed on hay in     
 Winter and grass in Summer.           
   The milk is first drawn into a glass
 measuring vessel to record the output 
 of each cow.The milk then flows into  
 the refrigerated bulk farm tank where 
 it is immediately cooled to below 5   
 degrees C.Every 24 hours the farm is  
 visited by a collection tanker.The    
 driver inspects the milk,checks the   
 temperature and after a sample is     
 taken for subsequent testing, the milk
 is drawn from the bulk farm tank. The 
 tanker comes at 7_30am and takes the  
 milk to the dairy at{Stonebridge,     
{Durham City. }
