		<title>01DAISY HILL FARM</title>
		<content>  Mr Howe of{Daisy Hill Farm}is the    
 owner of a typical livestock farm in  
 the Langsett area. He has lived there 
 for 26 years and has seen and taken   
 part in many of the changes. His farm 
 comprises of 3.5 thousand acres of    
 moorland on which he grazes 200 sheep 
 and 240 acres of grassland on which he
 grazes 200 cows and grows silage and  
 hay.                                  
   Most of the land was poor to start  
 with and he is still in the process of
 reclaiming 4 of the fields of gorse   
 north west of Langsett. The farm is   
 capital intensive with only the farmer
 and his two sons working although they
 do have the occasional help of pupils 
 on three weeks experience courses. The
 busiest times of the year are Spring  
 (lambing) and Summer (silage and hay).
   The livestock has to be kept indoors
 longer than on lowland farms in Winter</content>
