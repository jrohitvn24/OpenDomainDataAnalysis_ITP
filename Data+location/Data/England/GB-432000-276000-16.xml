		<content>{The Information Centre}first opened in
 1971 to help local people find their  
 way around and to help with problems  
 other than legal.If someone wants to  
 find a bed for the night the Centre   
 will find one if they can.If they do  
 they charge 75p.For tourists they have
 set up a 'Tourist Trail'where someone 
 takes them around the sights of       
 Coventry.Lots of people visit the     
 Information Centre: in one year       
 133,397 people visited it.At the      
 Information Centre guide books,maps,  
 leaflets and pictures are available at
 a cost but some are free.If you want  
 to see some places of interest you can
 either ring up or visit the Centre at 
 36 Broadgate.However soon it is moving
 to smaller premises.7 staff work at   
 the centre which is open every day but
 Sunday and every Bank Holiday but     
 Christmas.                            </content>
