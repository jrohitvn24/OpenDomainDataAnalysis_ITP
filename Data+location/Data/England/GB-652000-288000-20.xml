		<content>Our area has changed considerably in   
recent years and is still undergoing   
further change. Much of the Lansdowne  
Estate at G.R. 527 903 and 532 903 was 
built during the late 1950's and early 
1960's on farm land. The South         
Lowestoft {Industrial Estate} in grid  
square 52 89, also built on land       
previously used for agriculture, is    
expanding rapidly. From G.R. 526 906 to
G.R. 534 907 another {housing} estate  
on land previously used as a golf      
course,  is almost complete. At G.R.   
522 905 the Rosedale Gardens Estate of 
private dwellings is expanding         
westwards towards the village of       
Carlton Colville. The cost of new      
houses in this area ranges from 23,500 
pounds for a two-bedroomed house to    
40,000 for a four-bedroomed house. The 
{population} of the area is increasing 
rapidly.                               </content>
