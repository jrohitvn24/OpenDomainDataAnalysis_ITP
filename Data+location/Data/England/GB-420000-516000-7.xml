 It once had a similar form to         
 Heighington ( south west of Newton    
 Aycliffe), as shown by hummocky ground
 representing the{foundations}of the   
 former buildings. This site is at GR  
 233189, now a grassed field next to   
 North Farm. There has been no         
 archeological work on this site so    
 this is all that is known about the   
 former extent of the village.
