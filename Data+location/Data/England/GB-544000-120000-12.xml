		<content>    Uckfield is a busy expanding town  
 which has its roots back in the time  
 when this area was the{great iron     
{foundry of England.                   
    Queen Elizabeth 1 stayed in        
 Uckfield at an inn renamed{"The       
{Maidens Head"}in her honour during    
 its heyday as a thriving iron centre. 
 The inn is still an hotel.            
   {The Parish Church}of the Holy Cross
 contains an excellent  brass of John  
 Fuller,one of the great iron founders.
    The oldest building, now cared for 
 by the Uckfield and District          
 Preservation Society,is{Bridge        
{Cottage}.It is a Wealden Hall house   
 constructed by craftsmen between 1380 
 and 1430.The cottage is part of a     
 redevelopment scheme which includes it
 as an exhibition centre and museum.   
 Local interest and concern is         
 providing the funds for this project. </content>
