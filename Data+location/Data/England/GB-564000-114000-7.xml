		<content> WHO WILL HELP WHEN WE ARE ILL.        
 Neither Ashburnham nor Bodle Street   
 boasts a doctor,dentist,nurse or      
 chemist.Doctor's surgeries are in     
 Windmill Hill,Herstmonceux or         
 Ninfield all several miles away       
 from the villages.Our nurse is in     
 Windmill Hill though 20 years ago a   
 custom designed nurse's house complete
 with office/treatment room was built  
 in Bodle Street.But soon "our"        
 nurse had to serve another area and   
 now she has retired and the house is  
 up for sale. Our chemist is in        
 Herstmonceux, and one doctor also     
 dispenses but no-one delivers.Not a   
 problem if you have a car.The nearest 
 Dentist is Hailsham but there are also
 dentists in Battle, Bexhill and       
 Eastbourne. A retired dentist who     
 lives in Herstmonceux will visit you  
 at home, if you need him.             </content>
