		<content>  There are five doctors in South      
 Molton. Also we have a cottage        
 hospital and a surgery. Most people   
 were born in a hospital. We asked 150 
 children in our school about the      
 diseases they have had. The most      
 common illness was chicken pox with   
 77. Next came measles with 72, mumps  
 with 40, flu with 29, whooping cough  
 with 27, slap face syndrome with 23,  
 earache with 20, tonsilitus with 13,  
 sore throat with 6, tummy bug with    
 4, hay fever with 3. The nearest big  
 hospital is in Barnstaple. You would  
 go there for an x_ray and also bad    
 injuries. You would go to South Molton
 hospital for illness and minor        
 injuries.
