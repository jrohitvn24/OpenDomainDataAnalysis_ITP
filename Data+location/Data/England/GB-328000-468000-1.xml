		<title>01ALDINGHAM GENERAL OUTLINE</title>
		<content> Some  of our  class have been going to
 Aldingham for  two weeks and have been
 looking around.                       
 Most of  our twelve  square kilometres
 is   salt  water   estuary,  in   fact
 ninety-eight  percent!  Bordering  our
 patch  is  a old church with  a grave-
 yard  and  a  enormous   building,  it
 used  to  be  a huge private  mansion,
 with  a large garden that covers  some
 of our square.                        
 There  is  the  remains  of a  railing
 which  was  cut down in World  War Two
 for scrap iron on a very old wall that
 is small in height and long in length.
 Just  behind  that  is  a  wood  which
 protects the mansion from the sea. And
 just behind that  is  the  sea and the
 beach.  There   is  a   planted   wood
 which  protects  the  house  from  the
 south wind.                           
                                       </content>
