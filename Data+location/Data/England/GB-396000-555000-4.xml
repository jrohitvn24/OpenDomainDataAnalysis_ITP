		<title>04Slaley Parish Council.</title>
		<content>    The area is immediately served by  
 Slaley Parish Council, consisting of {
{5 members,}who traditionally stand as 
 independent of any political party.   
 The Parish Council meets 4 to 5 times 
 each year with additional meetings to 
 discuss planning applications or      
 immediate problems.                   
    Residents have close contact with  
 their councillors and rarely attend   
 meetings, although items are raised at
 the Annual Parish Meeting. The Parish 
 Council can deal with any matter of   
 concern by referring to the           
 appropriate service or higher         
 authority. The District Councillor    
 attends meetings and the present      
 Chairman is the elected County        
 Councillor. The Parish Council employs
 a part-time clerk who has been        
 traditionally the village headmaster.
