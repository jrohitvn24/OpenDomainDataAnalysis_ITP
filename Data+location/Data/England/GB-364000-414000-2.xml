		<content> Most of the land in the survey        
 area is owned by the North West Water 
 Authority, though much of it is being 
 sold off at the present time. Belmont 
 Reservoir, to the north of the        
 village, is a compensation reservoir. 
 It is used by Bolton Sailing Club.    
 A new supply{reservoir}for Belmont    
 is nearing completion. It is situated 
 on the north-eastern side of Winter   
 Hill. The other major water feature in
 the area is Ward's Reservoir, known   
 generally as "The Blue Lagoon". This  
 is owned by the Belmont Bleaching and 
 Dyeing Company and formerly supplied  
 water to power its mill. Today the    
 Blue Lagoon is a popular place of     
{recreation}, used particularly for    
{windsurfing}and{canoeing}. In summer  
 the approach to it, along Rivington   
 Road, is often heavily congested with 
 parked vehicles.                      </content>
