		<title>03Landscape in the Horton Area</title>
		<content> The landscape in Horton and Little    
 Sodbury is dominated by the Cotswold  
 scarp slope and the Vale of Sodbury.  
 There is grassland and crops with the 
 occasional woods or trees on the hills
 The villages of Horton and Little     
 Sodbury lie at the foot of the        
 escarpment of the Cotswold hills where
 the jurassic limestone meets the clay 
 vale.The villages were probably sited 
 here in the first place because water 
 was available from springs.The grass  
 is used for grazing for dairy farming 
 and hay is also grown which is        
 harvested in summer and used as a     
 winter feed.There are not many houses 
 in the village of Horton and most of  
 these are old.The surrounding         
 landscape is made up of individual    
 dairy farms on the clay of the Vale of
 Sodbury.
