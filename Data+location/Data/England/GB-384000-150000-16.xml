		<title>16REGULAR COMMISSIONS BOARD</title>
		<content>   If you are interested in becoming an
 Army officer it is quite likely that  
 you will have heard of the Regular    
 Commissions Board.  This is located in
 the grounds of a former country house 
 in Westbury, Leighton House and is    
 there to assess the suitability of    
 applicants to be officers in the Army.
 The RCB is directly responsible to the
 Department of Army Recruiting in the  
 Ministry of Defence.  Each year about 
 2000 candidates are tested and roughly
 300 visitors (Headmasters,Careers     
 staff from schools and Universties),  
 Overseas Armies representatives, and  
 Senior Army officers attend the boards
 at Westbury.  The lectures last for   
 3-4 days but most who come learn some-
 thing about themselves which stands   
 them in good stead whether or not they
 are suitable for officer training.Male
 &amp; female candidates do similar tests. </content>
