		<content> WHEN I WAS APPOINTED TO THE SCHOOL 17 
 YEARS AGO FAMILIES WERE ATTRACTED TO A
 SMALL VILLAGE INSTITUTION FROM THE    
 FRINGE OF THE PARISH, TRADITIONALLY   
 THE CATCHMENT AREA OF ASTON SCHOOL. A 
 NEW SCHOOL SITE WAS ACQUIRED BUT      
 'CUTS' PREVENTED BUILDING, IN SPITE OF
 THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE SCHOOL. AS A  
 MAINTAINED SCHOOL, ASTON WENT INTO THE
 REBUILDING PROGRAMME AUTOMATICALLY AND
 FAMILIES HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED FROM     
 WESTON. PARENTAL PREFERENCE HAS       
 ENCOURAGED COMPETITION. WITH POOR     
 ACCOMMODATION WESTON IS HANDICAPPED   
 BUT 3 CHILDREN ARE BROUGHT FROM       
 THULSTON, ATTRACTED BY OUR CURRICULUM 
 PUBLICITY. DAILY SESSION/LESSON       
 PLANNING IS DISPLAYED FOR PARENTS TO  
 SEE AND MY FILE IS CIRCULATED DURING  
 THE HOLIDAY WITH CHILDREN'S NOTEBOOKS 
 MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR PARENTS TO     
 TRACE BACK WORK TO TEACHERS'PLANNING. </content>
