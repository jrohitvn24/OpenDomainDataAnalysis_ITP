 reprieve with the timely arrival of a 
 non-stipendiary Priest-in-charge, but 
 its future is uncertain. An Area of   
 Outstanding Natural Beauty is a       
 delightful place in which to live but 
 the limitation on new building can    
 mean an ageing population and the loss
 of the very way of life which         
 attracted people here in the first    
 place. Farming has been the lifeblood 
 of the area for centuries, but farmers
 also are anxious about the future. The
 authors of this project are from the  
 Women's Institute which still         
 flourishes but finds it hard to       
 attract younger women and draws many  
 of its members from outside the area.
