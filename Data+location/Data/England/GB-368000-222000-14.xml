 the block is for{general farming.}The 
 farms vary considerably in size but   
 there are no very large holdings.     
  There are three{dairy farms}with one 
 of these also keeping sheep. The      
 cattle are all{British Fresian}with   
 the milk being collected by the Milk- 
 Marketing Board for distribution to   
 Bristol and London.                   
{ Sheep}are kept extensively,because of
 the terrain. The largest flock is to  
 be found on Green Farm.

 many livestock farms and the new      
 haylage has also been made this year.

 the first time in 1984. Cereal crops
