		<content>  Mr. and Mrs. Naughton own the racing 
 stables at High Gingerfield. They     
 usually have up to 20 horses. They do 
 not breed horses but buy 3 year olds, 
 either at Newmarket or Doncaster. They
 started the business in 1975.         
  About 100 yards along the road there 
 is an old racecourse which they use   
 for training, some horses are flat    
 racers, some jump.                    
  Flat racing jockeys have to weigh    
 between 7st. to 10 st., but jumpers   
 have to weigh between 10st and 12st.  
  Mr. and Mrs. Naughton have four      
 jockeys to ride and train the horses. 
  Two of the jockeys work full time,   
 and the other two work half time .    
  Usually flat jockeys retire at 50,   
 but if they jump they retire at 35.   
  Two of the jockeys take the horses to
 the river in Richmond for exercise as 
 the water strengthens their muscles.  </content>
