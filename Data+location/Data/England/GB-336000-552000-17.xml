		<content> Because of a change in government     
 policy many people have bought the    
 houses they live in from the council. 
  The private houses were begun on the 
 north side of the Wigton road in the  
 1960's and the estate is still        
 expanding today.Many of the houses    
 were built to individual designs and  
 look very modern.There is a large     
 comprehensive school on the estate and
 some council houses.                  
   The estates have shops,churches,pubs
 and schools.The community is generally
 thriving and this is reflected in the 
 well maintained look of the area.
