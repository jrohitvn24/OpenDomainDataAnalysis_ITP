		<content> The village of Cranfield has seen much
 infilling and extension away from the 
 main village core due to the presence 
 of the Institute of Technology and    
 pressure from commuters.The           
 development along the road to Broad   
 Green and East End was inter-war      
 ribbon development with areas of      
 housing "infilled" (such as Partridge 
 Piece) up to the present day.Shops and
 services were provided with these     
 developments resulting in a straggling
 urban form away from the original     
 village centre.                       
 Bourne End retains its own character  
 as a community of mainly pastoral     
 farms.A Mission Room built here in    
 1871 may have served as the infant    
 school for Bourne End for a short time
 late in the century.Upper Shelton has 
 expanded laterally along the Wootton  
 road and southwards.                  </content>
