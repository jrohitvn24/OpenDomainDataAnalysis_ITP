{Cookham Nursery School}(situated near 
 the{Pound)}was established in the     
 early 1970's and admits children for  
 one to two years before they enter    
 full time education at five years old.
 The children attend for half a day    
 only on each of the normal school days
 - Monday to Friday.  They learn early 
 skills eg. in number, letters, hand   
 control, simple crafts - all in a     
 play-like setting. Approximiately 60  
 children attend at either the morning 
 or afternoon sessions of the school.  
 The children leave the nursery when   
 they are five and will attend one of  
 the local Primary Schools until they  
 are eleven years old.                 </content>
