 ------------                          
   This                                
 is a conservation area, especially the
 village of Offham. Which until recent 
 years was the home of those whose work
 was totally involved with agriculture,
 now, however, the pattern is changing 
 as the inhabitants either commute     
 daily to London or other local        
 industrial towns to work. there are   
 many houses  dating back to the       
 sixteenth and seventeenth century of  
 gret charm and character which have   
 been restored and cosiderably         
 upmarketed now occupied by many       
 retired people.                       
   New building has taken place but    
 this can only be done with planning   
 permission to ensure that the         
 environment retains its rural         
 character as much as possible.        </content>
