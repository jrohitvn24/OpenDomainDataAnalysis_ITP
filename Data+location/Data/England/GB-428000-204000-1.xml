		<content>{   Carterton }is a fast growing town. 
 Our section includes its shopping and 
 industrial areas and much new         
 housing.The local farms have a rich   
 variety of products. We have examples 
 of beef, dairy and arable farming as  
 well as a large {mushroom unit}and a  
{racing stables.      Black Bourton,}  
 mentioned in the domesday book, has   
 retained its village character despite
 its proximity to the airfield.        
   {RAF Brize Norton}is probably the   
 predominant feature in our locality.  
 It is the heart of the passenger      
 transport of the RAF and a large      
 number of service families live within
 Carterton.The landscape reveals flat  
 farmland with hedged fields and few   
 copses.The loss of elms due to disease
 is still evident.The soil is heavy    
 clay in some regions.Hard stone brash 
 in others.                            </content>
