		<title>07A day in Richard's life</title>
		<content>I am 15 years old.  A typical school   
day for me would be to get up at 7.00. 
I get ready for school at 8.15, then I 
walk to school with my friends.  I     
enter the school gates at 8.45, then we
wait at the front of the school ready  
to go into assembly.  We go to         
registration, then at 9.25 we go to    
our first lesson. There are 4 lessons  
in the morning. There is a 15 minute   
break in the middle of the morning.    
Lunch time is at 12.05.  I go home and 
have sandwiches. At 1.10 we have       
registration then back to lessons. The 
bell rings at 3.45 for end of school so
we then go home. When I get home I get 
changed out of my school uniform which 
is black and white, and go out with my 
friends. Sometimes I play cards.  I    
do my homework in school.I am looking  
forward to leaving school next  year.
