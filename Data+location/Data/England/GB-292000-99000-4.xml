		<content>      Our school field has been divided
 into two parts:one part is a football 
 pitch,the other is a conservation     
 area.This area has been set aside as  
 a habitat for wild flora and fauna.   
 We regularly study this area as part  
 of our school work.The conservation   
 area was planted with sixty {native   
{British trees}.We have oak,sycamore,  
 holly,ash,sweet chestnut,and birch.   
 There are three trees which are over  
 one hundred years old.The conservation
 area is 80 metres by 30 metres,and was
 saved from commercial development by  
 the intervention of the vicar,        
 churchwardens,and representatives of  
 Thorverton Parish Council.It is also  
 a habitat for the wild flowers which  
 are dying out from their natural      
 habitat.
