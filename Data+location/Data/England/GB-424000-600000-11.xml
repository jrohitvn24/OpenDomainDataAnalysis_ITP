		<title>11THE COUNTRY PARK</title>
		<content> As soon as you walk through the gate  
 of the country park you can see, along
 the path which leads to the beach, a  
 vast amount of plant life. On the east
 of the park you can see newly planted 
 trees and saplings, while on the west 
 side you can witness a good example of
 a{'man-made'}environment and a        
{'natural'}environment. The man-made is
 the opencast and housing estates,     
 while the natural is the open fields, 
 trees and bushes. Although the country
 park is very pleasant to look at,     
 there are      few facilities for     
 organised activities. This is to be   
 expected as the park is very new. No  
 doubt, as time goes on, more          
 facilities will be introduced.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
