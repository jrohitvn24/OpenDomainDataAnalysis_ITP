		<title>05LIFESTYLE WICKLEWOOD THEN</title>
		<content> My grandfather went to live in        
 Wicklewood when he was two years old, 
 in 1907, and lived in a thatched      
 cottage. In 1912 there was a bad flood
 and a boy and several cows were       
 drowned.The first motor in the village
 was a privately owned bus and it      
 provided the first service. There were
 four public houses called The Wild    
 Man, Kimberley Arms, Brickmakers'     
 Arms and the Cherry Tree. Only the    
 last remains. The mill was worked by a
 father and two sons and the miller    
 could be seen milling at night in his 
 nightgown if the wind was strong!     
  During the First World War a British 
 plane crashed in a cornfield and a    
 bomb landed near St. George's School. 
  There were two brothers who made top 
 quality boots,a baker,                
 butcher,blacksmith and a carpenter.   
 There was a post office in High Street</content>
