		<content> In the Cambridgeshire Village College 
 system, education after school hours  
 is very important. Classes use the    
 school buildings and field, while     
 clubs and societies do also, if they  
 affiliate themselves for a small fee. 
 Participants' ages range from 16 to 70
 and the service has been offered since
 1948 (27 years).                      
{                                      
{Winter}courses include typing, Indian 
 cookery, computing, painting, keep-fit
 better driving and photography. In the
{summer,}there are badminton, German,  
 Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, choir 
 and dance-exercise. Clubs include the 
 Brownies and Beavers, football and    
 cricket. An annual exchange is        
 arranged with{Willich,}near Moenchen  
 Gladbach in Germany.                  
 These activities will survive the     
 closure of the village College.       </content>
