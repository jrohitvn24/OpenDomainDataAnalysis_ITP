		<title>08The George Inn</title>
		<content>                                       
  The George Inn built in the          
 eighteenth century took its name from 
 the King. It is situated at the top of
 Portsdown Hill with splendid views    
 over the city of Portsmouth and       
 beyond. It is believed to have been a 
 'drag' station stabling horses that   
 were used to help stage coaches up the
 hill. The original small rooms        
 downstairs have been cleared to make  
 open areas but some original beams and
 brickwork remain. The inn was popular 
 with cyclists and in 1967, following  
 extensive roadworks nearby, has been  
 mainly popular with local people.
