 She has owned Brancepeth castle since 
 1978 when she bought it from James A. 
 Jobling,glass makers from             
 Sunderland.The castle was built in the
 12th century but parts have been added
 to it at various times.Some of the    
 stone was quarried from Brandon       
 Village, behind Mr.Harle's farm.There 
 is supposed to be a ghost called the  
 White Lady, girlfriend of Bobby       
 Shaftoe, but Mrs.Dobson has never seen
 it.Today the castle houses Brancepeth 
 post office and students from Durham  
 University.
