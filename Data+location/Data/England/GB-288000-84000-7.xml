		<content> THE VILLAGES OF KENN AND KENNFORD FORM
 DORMITORY VILLAGES FOR PEOPLE WORKING 
 IN EXETER 5KMS AWAY. NUMEROUS PEOPLE  
 COMMUTE EACH DAY TO THE CITY TO WORK. 
 THE OPENING OF THE A38 AS A DUAL      
 CARRIAGEWAY TO PLYMOUTH HAS GIVEN THE 
 CHANCE FOR PEOPLE ALSO TO COMMUTE TO  
 THIS CITY.THIS HAS MEANT THAT IT IS   
 ALMOST NECESSARY FOR EACH FAMILY TO   
 HAVE ITS OWN FORM OF PRIVATE          
 TRANSPORT.PUBLIC TRANSPORT IS LACKING 
 AND IS SOMETHING PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO 
 SEE IMPROVED.MANY PEOPLE PRAISE THE   
 CAR,LORRY,MOTORCYCLE OR BUS, OTHERS   
 CURSE THEM AS THEY CAUSE DISRUPTION TO
 A QUIET VILLAGE LIFE.CHILDREN OVER THE
 AGE OF 11 TRAVEL TO SCHOOL IN DAWLISH 
 EITHER BY SCHOOL BUS OR PRIVATE CAR AS
 THE ONLY SCHOOL IN THE VILLAGES IS FOR
 CHILDREN BETWEEN 5 AND 10 YEARS OF    
 AGE.
