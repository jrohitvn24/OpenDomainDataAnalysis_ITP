		<title>18POLICE FORCE ,BATH,1985</title>
		<content> Recently, {Sean}and{Jason}carried out 
 a survey of the police in Bath.They   
 interviewed the police and this is    
 what they found out.                  
     Firstly,there are approximately   
 100 policemen stationed in the city.  
 They have 4 police dogs which are     
 capable of catching a man with a 100  
 metres start!                         
     Everyday there are 4 cars and one 
 motorbike out all the time on patrol. 
 We asked P.c. O'Hagan if he had ever  
 caught a burglar.He replied "Yes".We  
 also asked him if he had ever used his
 truncheon.Again he replied "Yes".We   
 asked him when this was, and he said  
 it was when he went to police the     
 miners' picket line recently.         
     The Bath police use{computers}to  
 help them catch criminals.The{numbers}
 on policemen's uniforms help to       
 identify  police officers.            </content>
