		<content> Local government consists of the      
 Hampshire County Council, based in    
 Winchester, the East Hampshire        
 District Council, based in            
 Petersfield, and the Whitehill Parish 
 Council. Whitehill Parish Council     
 looks after the interests and         
 welfare of the local people. The East 
 Hampshire District Council provides   
 for refuse collection, hygiene,       
 property development and planning.    
 In 1985 there was an election, and the
 Liberal Party won the District Council
 from the Conservatives for the first  
 time in many years. The Parish Council
 is still controlled by the            
 Conservatives.                        
 The County Council keeps an eye on the
 District Council and also provides    
 such things as educaion, the police,  
 and better roads.
