		<title>19Hythe Ranges</title>
		<content>   In 1854 the{School of Musketry}was  
 opened in Hythe to train officers and 
 N.C.O's to use the new Enfield rifle. 
 A firing range was opened on the      
 seashore where the ranges are today.  
 The name was later changed to the     
{Small Arms School}which remained in   
 Hythe until 1968. The ranges today are
 used to train men from many regiments 
 to use self loading rifles and general
 purpose machine guns. To do this they 
 have static targets at different      
 distances and moving targets. They    
 have built a full size model of a     
 street with pop up targets to aim at  
 and there are big boxes to catch the  
 bullets. The soldiers are counted when
 they arrive and checked again when    
 they leave to make sure no-one has    
 been lost or injured.
