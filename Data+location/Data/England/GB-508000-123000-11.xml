		<title>11Commuting from Billingshurst</title>
		<content> Weekday mornings and evenings{(7am &amp;  
{7pm)}see many people (particularly    
 men) commute to the London rail       
 terminii of{Victoria &amp; London Bridge.}
 This is expensive{(Â£1000+ per annum)} 
 and time consuming{(70 minutes).}     
 London however holds out the prospect 
 of jobs at above average earnings in  
 the Head Offices of large, often      
 multinational, companies particularly 
 in the{insurance}and{banking}fields as
 well as jobs in{stockbroking}and the{ 
{'city'.}Commuting can become a whole  
 way of life. Regular card schools grow
 up as well as friendships and an      
 informal but 'understood' seating     
 pattern.{Buffet Cars}become mobile    
 pubs. High cameraderie exists         
 especially in times of{rail strikes.} 
 Spouses frequently drive people to the
 station to avoid parking problems and 
 thus more social networks begin.      </content>
