		<title>14FARMING, SOMERFORD AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
   Farming is the major activity in our
 area and Brook Farm in Great Somerford
 is a good example.It is very old and  
 has been worked for about 900 years.  
 The present owners have been there    
 since 1947.                           
   There are 542 hectares of land but  
 some of these are rented out to other 
 people.Most of this is used for dairy 
 farming but some is used for growing  
 crops.At present there are 449 acres  
 of wheat,98 acres of barley,37 acres  
 of oil-seed rape and 12 acres of      
 potatoes.                             
   As the local farms are situated     
 close to a river,they have to be very 
 careful not to allow toxic waste and  
 silage to seep into the river.This    
 pollution would kill the fish and the 
 fine can be as much as Â£1000.
