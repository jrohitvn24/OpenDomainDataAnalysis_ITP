		<content>    The population of under 400        
 consists of old Hampshire families,   
 farming folk,retired professionals,a  
 few Americans and week-enders.        
    The{Malthouse Farmshop}is the only 
 shop in the village.It incorporates   
 the post office and general store run 
 by a staff of three.                  
    Travellers through this small      
 village will be surprised to find a   
{transport depot}that employs twelve   
 people.Ten lorries carry plastic,paper
 and agricultural products all over the
 country.                              
    Apart from those employed in       
 agriculture people travel to nearby   
 towns for work.Cars are essential as  
 public transport is inadequate.The bus
 runs on a circular route calling at   
 the village six times per week-day.
