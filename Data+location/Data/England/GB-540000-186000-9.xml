 Like nearly everyone in my school I   
 live in a terraced house. I've got my 
 own bedroom and my own television. In 
 our road there are lots of nice houses
 but is is a very busy road. Our garden
 has flowers and a swing and a climbing
 frame and it joins onto the park. At  
 the other end of the road is a        
 field. Our milkman comes round every  
 day.                                  
 I live in a flat. It is the middle of 
 three storeys. Nearby is a much taller
 building with seven floors.           
 I live in a council house and I share 
 my room with my sister. Our garden is 
 very neat, we have flowers growing.   
 My mum works in an old peoples home   
 and we live in the big house next to  
 the office.
