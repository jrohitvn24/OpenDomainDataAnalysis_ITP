		<content> Sweet pepper plants are bought from   
 Holland.They come about April or May. 
 These and lettuce are the main crops  
 now.The lettuces are grown in winter  
 and spring.The peppers are grown in   
 summer and autumn.As well as tomatoes 
 and sprouts they used to grow beetroot
 and parsnips.Mechanical packers were  
 used for tomato packing.There are     
 three tractors.Electronic watering    
 systems are used in the greenhouses.  
 They use about two million gallons a  
 year.Water is collected off the green-
 house roofs into a pond,and other     
 water is pumped from springs owned by 
 Webbs.Some of the disused land is     
 rented out to farmers.There are ten   
 old houses on the land that were used 
 in the past for workers.              
 The rows of Webb's greenhouses,and    
 others,can be clearly seen from the   
 hills around Mickleton.               </content>
