		<content> Cheshire is a flat, dairy farming     
 county which, millions of years ago,  
 was covered by sea and hence sits on  
 vast deposits of salt, 500 feet below 
 ground. The accessibility of this salt
 led to the founding of Brunner Mond, a
 chemical firm which became I.C.I.,    
 still the major employer in the area. 
 However, our D block is predominantly 
 dairy farmland with two interesting   
 saltworks and some minor industry.    
 We have a Country Park called Marbury 
 which has a Mere - a local name for a 
 lake. Nearby, there is the picturesque
 village of Great Budworth.  In Marston
 and Lower Wincham there are two salt  
 works, one completely traditional and 
 one modern. B.P. Nutrition, is        
 situated in Lower Wincham.  Comberbach
 and Wincham, once sleepy villages,    
 have been extensively developed as    
 residential areas in recent years.    </content>
