 house in its grounds .There is a lake 
 there as well. A church is on an      
 island in the lake. It is called St.  
 Mary's church.  Also near Orchardleigh
 is {Lullington}village.  It is very   
 pretty with its thatched cottages and 
 old village pump.  Lullington also has
 a small early Norman  church called   
 All Saints church. The country side   
 around here is dairy farming. There is
 a big Express Dairy at Oldford that   
 sends milk to London. The{River Frome}
 runs through the area on its  way to  
 the River Avon.  There is only one    
 main road, the A361 to Bath.
