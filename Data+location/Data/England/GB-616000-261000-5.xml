		<title>05Rural Crafts in Debenham.</title>
		<content>As saddler and harness maker,Mr        
L.Aldous is engaged in one of the      
oldest crafts. These rural crafts      
nearly died out some 25 years ago,but  
now the national interest in equine    
sports and driving provides more work  
than the firm can undertake.Most of    
the work is done by hand in the        
traditional manner.The quality of      
leather and craftsmanship is such that 
orders are given by firms hundreds of  
miles away from Debenham.   Reed and   
osier fences are made by Mr C.Balch.He 
cuts reeds for his work on a contract  
basis from fens and meres in Suffolk   
and Norfolk,but most of the willow     
used in his work is grown on his farm  
at Derrybrook or on rented land in     
Winston.Reed and osier fences are made 
up into panels and osier fences are    
made on site.Mr Balch also makes       
garden shelters and sheds from willow. </content>
