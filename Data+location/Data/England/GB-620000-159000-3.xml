		<content>      The{Stodmarsh}area has one       
 offical bus stop; the bus stops at the
{Stodmarsh Red Lion}on{Wednesdays}and  
{Saturdays}at{10.24, 13.14, 14.24}and  
{18.02.}The railway line that runs     
 through this area runs from{Minster   
 to{Sturry.}A small part of this line  
 used to serve{Chislet}coal mine when  
 it was still worked.                  
     There is only one main road       
 and that is the{main A28,}(only a two 
 lane road) on the north side of the   
{River Stour}and railway line; a       
 frequent bus service uses this road.  
     Most of the roads are narrow and  
 winding and often lorries cannot      
 pass on them.                         
     As most of this area is so poorly 
 served by public transport most people
 use cars. Mothers and children        
 frequently walk or cycle.
