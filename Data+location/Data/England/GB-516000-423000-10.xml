		<content> In our unit block there are one       
 or two tourist attractions. There is  
 the lighthouse which is situated on   
 the sea wall close to the sluice gates
 for the flood drain.The people who    
 live there keep wild birds in a pen   
 and it is quite interesting to look at
 them.Then there is the Battery which  
 is very interesting as there are plans
 to make it into some kind of military 
 museum.There is a group of people who 
 play at wargames there and dress up as
 soldiers.                             
  The riverbank and drains attract lots
 of fishermen and there are sometimes  
 competitions held.                    
  There is a football pitch and cricket
 pitch which attract teams from other  
 villages.                             
  We did a census of tourists and found
 that we attracted 35 people a day.
