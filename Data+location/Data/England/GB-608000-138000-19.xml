		<title>19Annual Steam Rally,Sellindge</title>
		<content> The Steam Rally is held in May on     
 Spring Bank Holiday Sunday and Monday 
 at Hope Farm off Swan Lane.It was     
 first held in 1970 after the Elham    
 Rally was stopped and was begun by Mr.
 Les Birch,the landowner and steam     
 enthusiast.It is mainly a display of  
 historical agricultural machinery,but 
 includes competitions for traction    
 engines and rollers as well as static 
 displays of vintage vehicles and steam
 machines.Exhibitors come by invitation
 from all over Britain and in the week 
 prior to the Rally,many steam vehicles
 pass through the village.About Â£9000  
 is needed to stage the Rally,so a fee 
 is paid by spectators.In 1970 any     
 profit was given to Sellindge Playing 
 Fields Fund,but now that project is   
 finished,the money is given to local  
 hospitals and groups in the village   
 who have helped with the organisation.</content>
