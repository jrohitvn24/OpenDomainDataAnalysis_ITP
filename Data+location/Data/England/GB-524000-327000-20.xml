		<content>      Daphne Ledward is our most famous
 villager.  She is a well-known        
 broadcaster and gardening celebrity,  
 appearing regularly on Radio Four's   
 Gardeners' Question Time and BBC TV's 
 Gardeners' Direct Line. {             
      When she came to Little Thatch,  
 her charming thatched cottage, four   
 years ago, her garden was a poor      
 little plot, dull and lacking in      
 interest.  Since then she has worked  
 hard to produce a garden worthy of    
 showing to the public. Every little   
 corner is crammed with plants of ever 
 description.                          
      In July, she will entertain many 
 visitors who will pay 50p each to view
 the garden in aid of Cancer Research  
      Daphne started her career writing
 stories for romantic magazines before 
 going on to write for gardeners.
