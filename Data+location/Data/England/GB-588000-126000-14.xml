		<title>14Camps and Fishing</title>
		<content>  At playtimes at school we play in our
{camp}at the top of the field.  We play
 cowboys or children who have run away 
 from their mother and father.  We make
 things out of mud and other things we 
 find.  We have a food store and a     
 well.  We have a kitchen where we make
 food and a sitting room for playing   
 games and going to sleep.  At home I  
 play in my own camp which is          
 camouflaged so nobody can see it.     
                                       
  I like {fishing}because it is a quiet
 sport.  I have 2 rods.  The idea is   
 that you cast out the line, with hook 
 and bait at the end, by flicking the  
 rod.  You look at the float which is  
 attached to the line.  If the float   
 goes under you have a bite and you    
 reel in the fish. It is possible to   
 sit by the water for hours and catch  
 nothing.                              </content>
