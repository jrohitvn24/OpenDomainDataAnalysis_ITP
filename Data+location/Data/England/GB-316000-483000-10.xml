		<title>10WALTHAM NURSERY, THWAITES</title>
		<content> Waltham Nursery is near the The Green.
 It has been there for 40 years and is 
 there because the land is good. Mr.   
 Rayson decided to go into business    
 because he is interested in growing   
 fuchsias. He has been growing them for
 6 years. He sells fuchsias all over   
 the world.They are packed in boxes and
 sent by air, sea or post.Some are sold
 from the nursery as well. There are   
 over 400 different types and about    
 half are grown at the nursery. He     
 displays some of them in hanging      
 baskets. He has won hundreds of prizes
 including a Rose bowl which has been  
 competed for by people from all over  
 the country. Waltham Nursery has won  
 it twice before for its display of    
 fuchsias.He has just won another award
 at the Rose Show at Holker Hall.He    
 does not employ anyone at the nursery 
 but all his family help.              </content>
