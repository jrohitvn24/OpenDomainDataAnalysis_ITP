		<content> Westbury Farm was the old Tudor Manor 
 House of Purley Parva.The foundations 
 of a barn date back to the first      
 Domesday Book and aerial photographs  
 show evidence of a medieval village.  
        The Thames Valley was famous   
 from Roman times for producing wines. 
 Mr Theobald, the proprietor, decided  
 to change to grape growing in 1969.   
        He was the first to follow a   
 new growing method using well_spaced, 
 high supports.From the original twenty
 varieties he selected ten for         
 wine-making _ more than any other     
 grower in this country.He is the only 
 grower to produce red as well as white
 wine.Covering over fifteen acres it is
 one of the largest vineyards.
