 The Occupational Therapy Unit contains
 facilities for painting and teaching  
 patients to feed themselves. The more 
 severely physically and mentally      
 handicapped do not spend such long    
 periods in the Occupational Therapy   
 Unit.                                 
 Some patients go horse riding and     
 swimming for which trophies have been 
 won.  In winter there are film shows  
 on Saturday mornings.  Frequent       
 outings and holidays are arranged. On 
 outings there would be 2 staff to 8   
 patients, but on holidays the ratio   
 would be 4 staff to 8 patients.       
 Holidays are taken in Morecambe,      
 Scarborough and Settle.  This summer  
 some are going camping under canvas.  
 The League of Friends purchased a 12  
 seater bus for outings of this kind.  </content>
