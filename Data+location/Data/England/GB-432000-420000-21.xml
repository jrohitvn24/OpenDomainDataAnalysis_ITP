<title>21An introduction to Wakefield 2011</title>
<content>The Queen victoria statue has long since been moved closer to the police station (probably to prevent theft). I'm sure much of Wakefields population would struggle to recognise the figure and probably make the assumption it was part of the other "sculptures" in Wakefield. &lt;br />&lt;br />Wakefield has now become over run by poverty, each road in Wakefield saturated by coffee shops or night clubs and very little else, recently Sainsburys has been reloacated and created an additional shopping centre, however this does not entice economic growth like one might expect. Wakefield seems so full of keen ideas which lack logic, prime examples being the leisure centure... without a car park. Why neglect the old shopping centre (the ridings) and build a new one? Not that either shopping centres are any good...&lt;br />&lt;br />The prison is overpopulated by some of the most dangerous people in the country (some of whom are no doubt from Wakefield)&lt;br />
