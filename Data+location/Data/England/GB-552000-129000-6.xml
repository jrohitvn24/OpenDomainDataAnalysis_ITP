		<content> Adults get up between 6_7.30a.m. but  
 if involved in shift work this would  
 vary.Some eat a light breakfast but   
 some have fried egg, bacon &amp; sausage. 
 Wives at home spend much time feeding 
 and playing with their children or    
 taking and collecting them from school
 &amp; cleaning the house.Adults at work   
 mostly have evenings and weekends free
 Leisure activities include watching   
 television, handicrafts, decorating,  
 reading &amp; caring for pets but outside 
 pastimes are also enjoyed.Some        
 families are more mobile &amp; move house 
 regularly due to job opportunities.   
 Elderly people have more time at home 
 when retired.Most families eat their  
 main meal of the day in the evening,  
 when everyone is at home.
