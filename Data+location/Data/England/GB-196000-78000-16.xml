		<title>16Port Quin</title>
		<content> Port Quin is a small quiet bay on the 
 north Cornish coast in the middle of  
 the countryside.It has a cliff walk   
 which leads from Port Quin to Port    
 Isaac which goes right on the edge of 
 the cliff and has lots of steps.Doyden
 Point is on the other side of Port    
 Quin bay.It is a sort of mound with a 
 path all round it.In the middle of it 
 there is a folly which belongs to the 
 National Trust.In 1978 a ship was     
 wrecked off Doyden Point where it     
 stayed for several years until broken 
 up for scrap.Years ago they used to   
 bring pilchards from the sea into the 
 fish cellars which are now private    
 holiday cottages.The bay itself is    
 safe for swimming but there are rocks 
 and quite a lot of seaweed.I think    
 that Port Quin is a very nice quiet   
 place.
