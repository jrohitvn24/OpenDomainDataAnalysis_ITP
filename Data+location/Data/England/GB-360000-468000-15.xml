		<title>15TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION</title>
		<content> The main road running through the area
 is the B6480 it is fairly busy because
 it is part of the shortest route from 
 Lancaster to Leeds. On the other hand 
 it would not be considered busy by    
 urban standards. The bus service along
 this road is regular but infrequent   
 particularly at weekends and most of  
 the population find that private      
 transport is essential if they are to 
 maintain a normal life. A survey      
 conducted from a point on the village 
 green at Wennington between 9 am and 3
 pm on Wednesday, 10 July 1985 showed  
 that cars are easily the most frequent
 users of this route: in this period   
 685 cars were recorded, 85 lorries,   
 141 vans, 23 agricultural vehicles and
 2 coaches. At the same time a mere 4  
 buses went past.
