centre in Head Lane as being divided   
into Junior\Infant sections.There were 
150 children and 5 staff.Your teacher  
taught you all subjects. The subjects  
included English arithmatic and nature 
study with a little history and        
geography.Good writing using a pen and 
ink was sressed.Juniors wrote on       
slates.There were separate boys\girls  
playgrounds. You read silently if your 
teacher was  not present.You were      
caned if you did wrong.Boys wore caps  
and short trousers. There were no      
school dinners but a hot drink was     
provided. Empire,Sports and Ascension  
Days were special events as was the    
annual Flower Show.Toilets were        
outside and rooms were dark with high  
ceilings and windows.School lasted     
from 9 to 4. You learnt poems by heart </content>
