		<content> Most of the houses in Ticknall were   
 built in the Nineteenth Century when  
 Ticknall was a  thriving community,   
 with Limework and brickyards. Many of 
 them were originally just one storey, 
 made of stone, with a second storey of
 brick added later. They are mainly    
 owned by Calke Estate. Recently many  
 of the cottages have been modernized  
 and have modern conveniences which    
 include central heating.              
                                       
 Since Mr. Henry Harpur Crewe inherited
 the Estate he has had to pay          
 Â£8,000,000 in Death Duties. This has  
 meant that some of the older          
 properties have had to be sold. One   
 farm house was sold for Â£90,000.      
                                       
 In 1970 the Church commissioners sold 
 the Vicarage and Garden.
