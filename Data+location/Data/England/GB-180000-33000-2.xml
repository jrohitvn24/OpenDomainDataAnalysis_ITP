		<content>    The village of Flushing has        
 always been associated with the sea.  
 For many years the locals have fished 
 the surrounding seas and have recently
 formed a fishing co-operative to make 
 the fishing and marketing more        
 efficient.                            
                                       
    The natural harbour of Falmouth    
 has been a major port of call for     
 ships from all over the world since   
 Tudor times. The packet service ran   
 from Falmouth for much of the 18th and
 19th century and news of many famous  
 battles first arrived at Falmouth.    
 Most of the Packet captains and their 
 crews lived in Flushing and the Packet
 captains' houses are part of the      
 Georgian sea frontage today.
