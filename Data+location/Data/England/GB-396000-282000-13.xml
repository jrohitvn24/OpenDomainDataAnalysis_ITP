		<content>    We attend Our Lady and Saint       
 Kenelm's Roman Catholic Primary       
 School, the only one in Halesowen. It 
 is about 20 years old and the present 
 Catholic Church in Siviter Street is  
 about the same age.                   
    St. John's Church of England Parish
 Church in the centre of Halesowen     
 apparently stands on the site of an   
 old Saxon church.                     
    The ruins of the 13th century Abbey
 built by Premonstratension monks and  
 demolished by King Henry VIII are     
 visible on the banks of the River     
 Stour.                                
    Local landowner, Lord Cobham, has  
 plans to hand over the church of St.  
 Kenelm with its famous miraculous     
 well, to Romsley Parish Church.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
