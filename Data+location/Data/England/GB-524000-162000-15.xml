		<title>15Diamond Riding, Carshalton.</title>
		<content> The Diamond Riding Centre is a riding 
 centre for handicapped people,        
 attached to Queen Mary's Children's   
 Hospital, and a variety of handicapped
 people benefit enormously from the    
 riding.  Both mentally and physically 
 handicapped people ride, some are     
 wheel-chair bound, so there is a      
 mounting block for those with         
 difficulty. The centre was opened in  
 May l974 by Princess Anne. When you   
 arrive at the centre sited on         
 Woodmansterne Road, Carshalton,       
 opposite Oaks Park, one of the first  
 things that catches your eyes is the  
 Diamond emblem designed by Norman     
 Thelwell. It is of a child sitting    
 astride a Thelwellian pony; the child 
 carries a crutch instead of a crop.The
 Local Authorities contribute 45O      
 pounds towards cost. All riders pay   
 something.                            </content>
