		<title>06FARMING IN GENERAL</title>
		<content>    Much of our area is woodland or    
 farmland. There are many farms        
 throughout the area. The main ones are
 Upper Ensign Farm,Stile Farm, Young   
 Manor Farm, Gaskins,Howletts and      
 Thorpe Farm. They vary in size from   
 150 to 620 acres.The main farm        
 products are wheat,milk,hops,fruits   
 and livestock. These products are     
 usually transported by road, tankers  
 take the liquid products and other    
 lorries the rest.In spring the main   
 jobs are sowing and stringing the     
 hops. In the summer the main jobs are 
 hop picking, harvesting and fruit     
 picking. Winter is the time for       
 ploughing and looking after the       
 livestock.The summers here are usually
 warm and sunny but the winters can be 
 cold with a lot of snow on the hills. 
 There are about 25 to 30 farms in our 
 area.                                 </content>
