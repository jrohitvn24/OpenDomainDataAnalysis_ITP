		<title>04WERRINGTON MANSION</title>
		<content> Although the history of Werrington    
 starts during the reign of Edgar      
 (958-979), most of the present house  
 dates from 1641, built by Francis     
 Drake, nephew of Sir Francis Drake. . 
 In 1704 the present front was added,  
 very little has been altered since.A  
 fire, which badly damaged the         
 Elizabethan part in 1976, was mainly  
 confined to the roof. The house today 
 is owned by Mr.R.Williams Esq., whose 
 family bought the Estate in 1882.It is
 very much a family home for Mr. &amp; Mrs.
 Williams, their two daughters and two 
 sons.It is not open to the public.    
 However,during the shooting season,   
 lunches are held in the Servants' Hall
 (this apartment still retains its old 
 name)and various parish and local     
 functions are also held there. Very   
 occasionallyfunctions are held in the 
 main part of the Mansion.             </content>
