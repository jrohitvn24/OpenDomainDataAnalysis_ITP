		<title>07Traffic Census</title>
		<content> The ever_increasing volume of traffic 
 on roads has led to great problems    
 in wear and tear of the roads, and    
 large increase in accidents. Census   
 May 11th 1982 on a 12 hour two way    
 count was 4237 vehicles.Similar count 
 November 7th 1983 on a 10 hour two    
 way count was 6,000+                  
 Reason for this was the traffic  being
 redirected by Wilts C.C.from the A30  
 at Lopscombe Corner via Stockbridge to
 London, to the A343 Andover by_pass   
 thence to the M3.Also alterations at  
 Micheldever on the A303 encourages    
 traffic from London to use the Andover
 route.  Speed is one of the main      
 factors causing accidents.Much public 
 pressure has been exerted on those in 
 authority ie:the County Surveyor and  
 the police for speed restrictions and 
 extra double white lines to no avail.
