		<title>12Employment - Winchfield Area</title>
		<content> There are a few{self-employed}people  
 within the block but the two main     
 categories are those who work on the  
 farms and{those who commute}to London,
 Basingstoke, Fleet or Farnborough from
 Winchfield Station or work in nearby  
 Fleet or Hartley Wintney &amp; travel by  
 some other form of transport.         
{Unemployment}within the block is low &amp;
 is mainly youngsters who have just    
 left school. Although the area is     
 largely agricultural most of the farms
 only employ one or two people from    
 outside the family. Fleet Service     
 Station is another source of local    
 employment.The wholesale Nursery at   
 Winchfield Lodge has several employees
 and{others are employed in small      
{businesses}based in the old goods yard
 at Winchfield Station. (also see      
 'industry').
