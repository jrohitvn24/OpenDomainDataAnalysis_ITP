     After washing and dressing in my  
school uniform I go downnstairs for    
breakfast of cereals, piece of buttered
toast and drink of tea.   I get to     
school for 8.55. a.m. where we have    
registration followed by assembly which
consists of prayers, a story and songs.
     Our first lesson is usually Maths 
and then after a 15 minute break we    
have English untill noon.   In the     
afternoon we may do P.E. or Art and    
Craft or Science.   School finishes at 
3.25 p.m..                             
     After school I change out of      
school uniform and call for my friend. 
We sometimes play tennis or have a game
on my computer.  I go home at 9.00 p.m.
and watch television until I go to bed 
at 9.30 p.m.
