		<content>    Recently there has been a great    
 deal of controversy as to whether or  
 not there should be a plaque fixed on 
 the {War Memorial}in Ryhope village   
 in honour of{Pilot Officer Barton}who 
 was posthumously awarded the{Victoria 
{Cross}for avoiding crashing on houses 
 in Ryhope during the{Second World War.
    While on a bombing raid to Germany 
 his plane was attacked and damaged by 
 German fighters.{Barton}decided to    
 carry on with the bombing even though 
 he had lost his navigational team. He 
 released the bombs himself. Crossing  
 the coast near Ryhope on his return an
 engine failed. If he had abandoned the
 plane it would have crashed onto the  
 houses below so he stayed at the      
 controls and managed to crash-land the
 aircraft. He succeeded in avoiding the
 houses but unfortunately he lost his  
 life. Three of his crew survived.     </content>
