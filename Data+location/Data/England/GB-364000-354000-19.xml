		<title>19Fishing the River Weaver.2.</title>
		<content> When you get to the river stick to the
 slow water as it is not a very good   
 idea to fish fast flowing water.      
 Firstly, because fish like slow moving
 water best and secondly ,because it   
 could be very dangerous.              
 One thing you have to do before you   
 start fishing in the River Weaver and 
 that is you have to get yourself a    
 North West Water Authority licence.   
 This is a good buy because it covers  
 not only the Weaver,but also a lot of 
 other rivers and lakes in the North   
 West.                                 
 The fish in the Weaver are not really 
 suitable for eating,although you could
 if you wanted to, so when you have    
 caught your fish make sure that you   
 return them safely to the water.
