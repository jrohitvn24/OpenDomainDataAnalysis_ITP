		<title>17LOCAL HISTORY OF HORNDEAN</title>
		<content>{Gales Brewery}started about 250 years 
 ago. It was sold to a pub next door   
 called the Ship and Bell. It was an   
 old wooden building and was burnt to  
 the ground. It was rebuilt in 1869 in 
 its present Victorian style.          
 Before the {A3(M) motorway} was built 
 there were fields and a forest. Twice 
 a year there was a fair. When the     
 motorway was built lots of wild life  
 disappeared.                          
{Horse Racing}is an ancient sport and  
 originated in Hampshire. The flat     
 racing course at Horndean was made in 
 1818 and is still there although not  
 used.                                 
 Fifty years ago Horndean was a small  
 village. Before Hazelton Estate was   
 built there were fields and woods but 
 the building of houses destroyed it   
 all.
