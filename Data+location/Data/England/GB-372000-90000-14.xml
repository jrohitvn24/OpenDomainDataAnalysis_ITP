		<content>   Travelling east on the              
 Tincleton-Dorchester road we encounter
 the site of Heedle Williams pond which
 is exceedingly difficult to find as it
 is overgrown with braken.             
   To the north of the road is Duddle  
 Heath which rises up from the road and
 is covered in many tumuli.            
   The heath is covered in heather and 
 braken and is broken in the middle by 
 Duddle plantation which is a man-made 
 wood of mixed trees.                  
   Furthe east along the road is a     
 Georgian house -Norris mill.          
   Next to Norris Mill is Lower Norris 
 mill which is a farm ,owning 130 acres
 of dairyland.                         
   The road goes downhill in an        
 easterly direction with houses at     
 irregular intervals.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
