		<title>01General Introduction</title>
		<content> This block of land is bisected by the 
 River Dee, the Afon Dyfrdwy, and by   
 the border between England and        
 Wales,(parts of Shropshire and        
 Clwyd).Place names on either side of  
 the border are found in both          
 languages. Trees and grass cover most 
 of the area. On one side of the river 
 is the English hamlet of Sodylt and on
 the other the Welsh village of        
 Erbistock. There is no road bridge    
 over the river and in order to gain   
 access one has to make a detour on the
 B5069 via Overton bridge.             
 Information is included on the        
 following:samples of the{ 20 farms}in 
 the block, the{only two}units of      
 industrial trade, and for the visitor 
 we have included some places of       
 interest, two churches, a riding      
 school, an inn and the River Dee.
