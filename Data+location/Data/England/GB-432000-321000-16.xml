		<title>16BIRDS AT CARVERS ROCKS</title>
		<content>   At Carvers Rocks there are all kinds
 of different birds around. This means 
 that it is very good for bird         
 watching. There are water birds and   
 the birds that just like flying about 
 all the time, like{Yellow Hammers,    
{Chaffinches, Swallows, Blue tits}and  
{Great tits.}There are sign posts there
 to help you spot the different birds. 
                                       
   For the water birds there are       
{Mallards, Coots, Great Crested Grebes,
{Tufted Ducks}and{Dabchicks.}We saw a  
{Tufted Duck}on the Nature Reserve part
 of the lake where the fishermen are   
 not allowed to go, because it would   
 frighten them. There was a{Great      
{Crested Grebe}on a nest. We did not go
 too close because we might frighten   
 them, so we stayed on the other side. 
 We must not take any eggs at all      
 because it is against the law.        </content>
