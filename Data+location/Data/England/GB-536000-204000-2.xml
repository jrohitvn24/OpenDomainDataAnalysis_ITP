		<title>02The Borough of Broxbourne</title>
		<content> The Borough of Broxbourne (formed in  
 1974) has a population of approaching 
 75,000 and covers 20 square miles.    
 Broxbourne stands on the banks of the 
 River Lea. Towns in the Borough       
 include, Waltham Cross, Cheshunt,     
 Wormley, Broxbourne and Hoddesdon.    
 Most of the houses in Broxbourne are  
 quite old, and are preserved with     
 loving care for their architectual and
 historical values. Broxbourne Railway 
 Station, built 1840, was demolished in
 1959 as a result of the Beeching rail 
 cuts that affected England. The       
 station was later re-built in its     
 present location. Broxbourne Mill,    
 built around 1910, was gutted by fire 
 in 1952, and no longer exists.        
 People have been living in the area   
 since the stone-age.
