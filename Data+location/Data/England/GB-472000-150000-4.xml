		<title>04COLT HILL AND ODIHAM WHARF</title>
		<content> The old London road leading to the    
 Basingstoke Canal, is a quiet,        
 no-through road, now the by-pass is   
 finished. The Farnham by-pass carries 
 a steady stream of fast moving traffic
 away from the main shopping area in   
 the town. The Water-witch is a public 
 house on Colt Hill, its gardens reach 
 down to the canal bank. Rough grazing 
 land stretches along the sides of the 
 canal.                                
 Boats can be hired at the Wharf on    
 Colt Hill, for pleasure cruises along 
 the water-way. The barge ,named the   
 "John Pinkerton", is used to ferry    
 passengers along the open reaches of  
 the canal to see "King John's Castle".
 The canal crosses the River Whitewater
 using an aqueduct, near the Castle and
 flows under the swing bridge. Hikers  
 and walkers use the tow-path along one
 side of the canal to enjoy the scenery</content>
