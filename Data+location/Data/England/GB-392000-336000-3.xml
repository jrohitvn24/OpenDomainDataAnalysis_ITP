		<title>03FEATURES OF FULFORD</title>
		<content>The school of Fulford is 190 m. above  
sea level.There is only one school.The 
school was built in the 1920's.There   
are some interesting features  such as 
the local farms.These include Flatts   
Farm and Fulford Manor  as examples.The
Public House is called the Shoulder of 
Mutton and is of a great age. Fulford  
has a typical "English " village       
green.This was originally used as      
common grazing but today it provides a 
useful area for village fetes and child
play.Here is located the main post box 
which is convenient for the older      
members of the community who live      
facing onto the green.
