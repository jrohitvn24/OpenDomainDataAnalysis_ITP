		<title>19TYPES OF HOUSES IN SLOUGH</title>
		<content>    The housing of this area falls into
 three distinct bands.  To the extreme 
 west is the earliest housing built in 
 the late 1920s by the owners of the   
 Slough Trading Estate; these three    
 bedroomed houses are wholly privately 
 owned.  The next band contains two    
 areas.  To the north is the Manor Park
 Estate built for the borough council  
 fifty years ago for the many people   
 who came to Slough from 'depressed'   
 areas of Britain,  especially South   
 Wales.  These 'non-parlour' houses    
 with downstairs toilets are now partly
 privately owned and partly council    
 owned.  To the south are medium-sized 
 privately owned properties built less 
 than fifty years ago.  In between this
 housing and the final band is open    
 space, some arable land, a cemetery &amp; 
 crematorium, several schools and the  
 remains of a country estate.          </content>
