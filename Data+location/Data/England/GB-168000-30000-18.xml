		<title>18Employment - South Wendron</title>
		<content>                                       
      The largest single employer in   
 South Wendron is the Tourist          
 Attraction of Ha'Penny Park and       
 Poldark Mine, although much of this   
 work is seasonal.                     
      Many people in the area are      
 self-employed farmers or smallholders 
 and there are two nurseries,          
 specialising in garden plants.        
      There are some people who work at
 Cottage Industries, for example:      
 making Cornish Clotted Cream; wood    
 turning; pottery.  Two of our parents 
 are monumental masons, working in the 
 local stones, although their workplace
 is just over the edge of our block.   
      Many people have to travel       
 several miles to work each day in     
 nearby towns and there are a number   
 who are unemployed at the moment.
