		<content> In 1983 there were 63 children between
 the ages of 1 month and 18 years.12   
 were under 5 and 5 of these attended a
 playgroup in Bedford.Of the 19 in the 
 5-9 age group, 15 attended the village
 school until it closed in July 1983.  
 Now a bus takes them to Bromham.Of    
 those aged 10-18, 75% go by bus to    
 middle and upper school in Kempston   
 and Wootton.The rest attend private   
 schools in Bedford.In 1983 there were 
 6 full-time students(4 at University) 
 The children say they like living in  
 Stagsden although they have nowhere to
 play except the swings and must not   
 play in the fields as the farmers tell
 them off-or on the bales as they might
 fall on you.They like to visit the    
 Bird Gardens where local children are 
 admitted free and would not like to   
 see them close.
