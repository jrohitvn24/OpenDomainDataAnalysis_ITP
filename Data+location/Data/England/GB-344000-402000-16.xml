		<content>It was during the time of the          
industrial revolution that the building
of railway lines to Wigan, Liverpool,  
Ormskirk and St. Helens took place thus
providing a wider market for the       
industries and farmers.                
    There is a long history of         
craftsmen in the area, blacksmiths,    
nailors, weavers, locksmiths, miners,  
coopers, merchants and stonemasons     
however the three main occupations were
agricultural labours, pipe makers, and 
farmers.                               
    Once the geological formations of  
coal measures were discovered and      
several mines opened then this created 
another major source of employment.    
   Of the main occupations in the area 
only agricultural labourers and farmers
still remain.
