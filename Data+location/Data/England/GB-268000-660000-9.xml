		<title>09Road safety in Viewpark</title>
		<content>        Because our area of Viewpark   
had the worst accident record on the   
roads in the district we did work on it
in school. Most of the accidents were  
to pedestrians and 56% of them were to 
children. One third of these victims   
were between 12 and 15.                
        The main road (Old Edinburgh   
Road) is still very busy even though   
the Motorway has taken a lot of the    
traffic away. In the housing scheme are
some roads which are bus routes and    
have lots of vans etc. One which is    
near to our school is Laburnum Road.   
        This road winds a lot and has  
many cars parked along it because there
is no room for enough garages. It is   
very dangerous for pedestrians here as 
it is hard to see the fast traffic.
