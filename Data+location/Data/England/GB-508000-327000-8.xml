{raising effort for the Church-The Walk
{About Lunch.}A Sunday in midsummer is 
 chosen and,at noon,everyone collects  
 at The Grange for sherry and tit-bits.
 The next move is to The Old Rectory,  
 where the main course is served.This  
 consists of a variety of cold meats,  
 salads and new potatoes.A wander down 
 Fen Lane brings the gathering to a    
 galaxy of sweets at The White House.  
 Finally,coffee is served in the       
 village hall.Later,in the afternoon, a
 special service is held in the church,
 with tea and biscuits afterwards to   
 finish off a very pleasant day out.   
 Tickets,at Â£3.50,are considered very  
 good value and are much sought after  
 by outsiders who enjoy visiting this  
 small,close-knit community.{In 1985,  
{this village of 107 people raised     
{almost Â£400 with this event.          </content>
