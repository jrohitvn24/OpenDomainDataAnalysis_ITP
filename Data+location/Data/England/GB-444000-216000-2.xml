		<title>02TOURISM IN WOODSTOCK</title>
		<content>                                       
  Most of the tourists in Woodstock are
Americans. In one day, the highest     
number of people recorded visiting the 
tourist information office was 57.     
  There are four main reasons why      
tourists come to visit Woodstock, to   
see Blenheim Palace, to see the        
museum on the history of               
Oxfordshire, to see the shops and to   
see the beautiful scenes of the town.  
  The tourist information office is    
open all through the summer. It        
provides many things- leaflets, guide  
books, maps, bus time-tables, bus      
routes and lots of information on the  
town. There are two bus services       
which run through Woodstock- Worths,   
which goes from Woodstock to Oxford,   
the South Midlands Service, which takes
the same route. There is an open-topped
bus for a scenic drive to Blenheim.    </content>
