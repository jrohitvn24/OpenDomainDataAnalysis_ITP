		<title>13THE SMITHY,TWYFORD</title>
		<content> The smithy has been at Twyford for    
 over 200 years.It was origionally a   
 blaksmiths workshop.The blacksmith    
 used to shoe horses in the area and   
 repair agricultural implements.Shoeing
 a horse would cost 12p in 1895,today  
 it would cost over 15 pounds.         
 Mr.Cox was the blacksmith who worked  
 there in 1895.He successfully made an 
 iron bicycle in his work shop but was 
 not able to patent it quickly         
 enough,Mr.Raleigh beat hin to it.     
 After the blacksmiths was no longer   
 used as a smithy it reverted to a     
 family house.The present owners have  
 unsuccessfully tried to convert it    
 into a restaurant.                    
 There is no local blacksmith st the   
 present time.
