		<content>      At Coughton Ford the River       
 Arrow runs over Coughton Cross Lane.  
 It is set in beautiful countryside and
 is the perfect place for a picnic.    
 Tables are provided and children can  
 paddle in the Ford whilst grown-ups   
 relax on the grass.                   
      The trees around are good for    
 climbing or just admiring. There is a 
 bridge crossing the Ford so wet feet  
 aren't really necessary.              
      Cars can go through so you have  
 to be careful when you are paddling.  
      People come to the ford for      
 an outing from Birmingham and other   
 nearby towns.                         
      The Ford is well-liked because of
 its beauty and tranquility. You can be
 very active or you can just be still  
 and lazy. The sheer beauty of it      
 attracts most people.
