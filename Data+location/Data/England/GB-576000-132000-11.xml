		<title>11BENENDEN WEALD, MILKING.</title>
		<content> At Forest Farm all milking used to be 
 done by hand, the cows stood in pairs 
 in the milking shed. The milk was put 
 into 10 gallon churns and then taken  
 to Ashford. Jersey cows were used. Now
 they have changed to the shorthorn cow
 because it is better for beef. The    
 cows are now milked by machine and    
 they stand singly in the milking shed.
 The cows can be put through a foot    
 bath which hardens their feet, before 
 this they had to have their feet      
 trimmed. Once the cow is milked the   
 milk goes into a tank where the amount
 is recorded and a computer works out  
 how much food that individual cow     
 should have. The milk then goes into a
 large refrigerated tank. Some can be  
 made into cream using a traditional   
 machine with 19 discs.
