		<content> Housing in the village is in four     
 seperate sections.The original village
 is mostly built of the local soft red 
 sandstone and contains some houses    
 parts of which are mediaeval in       
 origin.South of the centre is the     
 Greenway Estate of 139 houses built   
 after the Second World War replacing  
 service huts which had been occupied  
 by squatters.About the same time north
 of the centre of the village the Darby
 Way Estate of 163 houses was built.In 
 1975 after an intensive drainage      
 scheme the Hither Mead Estate of 425  
 private houses was built to the east  
 of the centre of the village.         
 Proposals have been made to build to  
 the west of the village but so far    
 these have been rejected.
