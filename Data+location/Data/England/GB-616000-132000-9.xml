    In Hythe a man was born whose name 
 was{Francis Pettit Smith.}His house   
 was in Hythe High Street. He invented 
 the British version of the marine     
 screw propeller.                      
                                       
    He took part in a new form of      
 nautical spectacular; the tug of war. 
 In 1845,{H.M.S Rattler,}the first     
 Royal Naval screw propelled ship, was 
 at one end of the rope while at the   
 other end was the paddle wheeler      
{"Alecto".                             
                                       
    The two ships stood stern to stern.
 When a signal was given they both went
 full speed ahead. Both the ships had  
 200 hp engines. H.M.S Rattler's stern 
 propulsion was stronger and pulled the
 Alecto at 2.5 knots at full speed.
