		<content>{A CHILD'S POINT OF VIEW}by a 13yr old.
{Helping with farm work:}This applies  
 to a lot of children as most live on  
 or near farms. Not many children get  
 up early enough to help with morning  
 chores but most do help with mucking  
 out and haytiming and so on. Lambing  
 is a busy time for all the family and 
 many children find it exciting too,   
 bringing up lambs which have lost     
 their mother is one of the favourite  
 jobs. Cows aren't that popular though!
{Pets:}Many children have pet dogs,    
 some of which are farm animals so a   
 large majority of them are collies.   
{Rivers and swimming:}Most children can
 swim by the age of seven so water is  
 normally an enjoyable place to be.    
 Children swim and wash their dogs in  
 the rivers which are sometimes also   
 used for cows' drinking water.        
{Hobbies:}Most prefer outdoor hobbies. </content>
