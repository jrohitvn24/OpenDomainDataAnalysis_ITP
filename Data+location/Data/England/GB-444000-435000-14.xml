		<title>14A RETIRED PERSON'S STORY</title>
		<content>   I get up about 8.00am and have my   
 breakfast of toast and tea. I then get
 washed, shaved and dressed. I like to 
 work in the garden, and when I can, I 
 repair lawn-mowers for people, as I   
 used to be a mechanic. I sometimes    
 like to go for a drive in the car. I  
 like bird watching too.               
   I find food is different nowadays.  
 It is not as nourishing. I enjoy      
 eating steak best, and I like a glass 
 of beer, and a cup of tea or coffee. I
 have dinner about 12.15pm and tea     
 about 5.15pm. I live with my sister   
 who usually does the cooking, but I   
 can cook if she is out. I like        
 strawberries and raspberries.         
   In the evenings I like to watch     
 television. We have some cats, but I  
 like dogs aswell. I have some supper  
 about 10.00pm before I go to bed at   
 11.00pm.                              </content>
