		<content>  In Broadclyst we have{1 river}.The   
 river is called{"RIVER CLYST"}.It runs
 by our school.These are the fish you  
 can find in the river:{Trouts,eels and
 minnows.The river has lots of wildlife
 around it.E.g willows.The human life  
 on the river is varied.For example:   
 the farmers use it to feed crops,     
 biologists for research and watermills
 for power.The Clyst starts at Clyst   
 St.Lawrence and flows into the Exe.   
 --------------------------------------
 The{LANDSCAPE}around our school is    
 mainly fields &amp; hills.There's Ashclyst
 forest about 2 miles away.There's a   
 farm near the school.We also have the 
 B3181 runing past.There are several   
 houses at the end of the school.In    
 the school we have an orchard and two 
 ponds.Altogether the{LANDSCAPE}is     
 very mixed.     {ROBERT GLOVER.
