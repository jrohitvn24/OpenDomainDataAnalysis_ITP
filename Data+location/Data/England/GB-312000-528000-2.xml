		<title>02Cockermouth - an overview 2</title>
		<content> The major part of the survey area     
 apart from the town of Cockermouth is 
 hilly farmland with some uncultivated 
 moorland.  The farmland is sparsely   
 populated, with individual houses and 
 farmsteads. One major road, the newly 
 constructed A66 (1983) bisects the    
 area from north-east to west.  It is  
 the connecting road between the M6    
 Motorway at Penrith and the west coast
 towns of Whitehaven and Workington.   
 The land drains to the west, mainly by
 Bitter Beck into the River Cocker and 
 thence to the River Derwent, which    
 meets the Irish Sea at Workington.    
 The area's association with William   
 Wordsworth, the partly-ruined Castle  
 and the proximity of the Lake District
 National Park has given rise to an    
 increase in tourism in recent years.  
 This is helpful in a time of          
 unemployment in the area generally.   </content>
