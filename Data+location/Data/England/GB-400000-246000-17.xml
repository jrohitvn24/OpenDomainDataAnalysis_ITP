   7.Since the formation of the Group  
 the number of passengers using        
 Evesham,Moreton-in-Marsh,Kingham and  
 Charlbury(the only manned intermediate
 stations)has risen by nearly 30%.     
   Although membership is aproaching   
 the 2000 mark,these are only a few of 
 those who banafit from the train      
 service.                              
   This section of the line once       
 belonged to the Great Western Railway 
 Company which celebrated its 150th.   
 bithday this year. Trains which use   
 this line have changed from the       
 beautiful old steam locos. to more    
 advanced trains. Most on this line are
 diesel multiple units which are       
 relatively old compared to main line  
 trains.
