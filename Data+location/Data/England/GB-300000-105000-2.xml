		<title>02INDUSTRY IN CULLOMPTON</title>
		<content>   50 years ago industry was           
 varied;leather_tanning,weaving,manufac
 ture of gloves,jam,bricks and         
 paper.Now only the papermill remains  
 open,employing 100 people,whilst      
 population has doubled.A new          
 industrial estate has been built,but  
 despite motorway access little new    
 industry has been attracted,and what  
 has come is mechanised and not labour 
 intensive.Perhaps tourism could be    
 developed.Locally employed people work
 in services or farming.Others commute 
 to{Exeter.}Difficulty in finding jobs 
 is increasing for children leaving    
 school.This year of 151 leaving school
 15% found jobs,45% go to further      
 education,30% on training schemes and 
 10% straight on the dole.
