		<title>10PAST LAND USE: WARLEY, ESSEX</title>
		<content>   The 1838 Tithe Map for the parish of
 Great Warley was consulted in the     
 Essex CRO. The land here is mostly on 
 the{Upper Tertiary.}The following     
 comparisons were noted. 1. In 1838    
 Great Warley village was much the same
 size as today. 2. Settlement growth   
 has taken place only in the north,    
 towards Brentwood. 3. The area of     
 woodland has hardly changed. 4. Little
 has changed in the road network except
 for the M25 and the introduction of a 
 few farm roads. 5. Most of the land is
{now pasture.}In{1838}about{60%}of it  
 was{arable.}This is because Early     
 Victorian farmers found these lighter 
 soils easier to work than the London  
 Clay - which was thus left to pasture 
 - and concentrated on cereal growing, 
 encouraged by the high grain prices   
 offered before the repeal of the Corn 
 Laws.                                 </content>
