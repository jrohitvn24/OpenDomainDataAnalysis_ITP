		<content>Thursday 4th.July 1985. It's our sports
day. The competitors from our class    
make their way onto the field. Me and  
the other non competitors follow after 
an anxous five minutes wait. Lots of   
parents are seated on chairs across the
field. The atmosphere is electric as   
the boys line up for the first race.The
starter's gun sounds and the boys start
running around the specially cut grass 
track. Everyone is chanting,shouting   
and cheering. Then all of a sudden     
everyone disappears from around me.    
They've noticed that the tuck shop has 
opened. Eventually the boys pass over  
the finishing line and everyone starts 
to clap. Another few races pass until  
only the relay is left. The runners    
line up. BANG, they're off, running    
round the track faster than greyhounds.
A massive uproar sounds as out team    
cross the line. We've won sports day ! </content>
