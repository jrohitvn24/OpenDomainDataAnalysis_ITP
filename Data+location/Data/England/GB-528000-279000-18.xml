		<title>18THE WEIR,WARBOYS</title>
		<content> The{weir}is the only pond in Warboys  
 that you can legally fish in for free.
 It has all kinds of fish in it.I'll   
 name a few:rud,roach,perch,and        
 different kinds of carp and           
 tench,minnows,stickleback,eel,and     
 bream.A mirror carp is the heaviest   
 fish in the{weir.                     
 On one side of the {weir}there is a   
 hardware store called Stewards.It is  
 situated at a fork in the road where  
 Mill Green meets the High street. It  
 is down the road from the Library.In  
 the {weir}there are mostly fish but   
 there are two patches of lily pads    
 and a lot of weeds. lt also has a few 
 ducks on it.It was used for Baptisms  
 until the 1930's when a new baptistry 
 was built in the Baptist Chapel. There
 are lots of insects like pond skaters 
 and flies and lots of amphibians like 
 toads, frogs and newts.               </content>
