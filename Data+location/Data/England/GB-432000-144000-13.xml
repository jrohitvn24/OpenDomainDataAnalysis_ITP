		<content> In l985 most people have cars. Cars   
 are motor driven vehicles which can   
 take up to 5or 6 people in one go.    
 Cars have 4 wheels (some have 3) which
 are what they travel on. The car has a
 hard shell orbody and 4windows which  
 are possible to wind down (depending  
 on what size car you have) There are  
 many names for cars, e.g. Ford        
 Granada. Air travel is very popular   
 today the things that are used are    
 called aeroplanes. These can range    
 from the giant galaxy carrier aircraft
 to the small 4 man Cesna. Thruxton is 
 a place near Andover where there is an
 air field where planes take off and   
 land from. In Andover people can      
 travel locally on the bus or double   
 decker. A double decker is a machine  
 with a long fusilage and is two single
 deckers high so this is what transport
 is like today.                        </content>
