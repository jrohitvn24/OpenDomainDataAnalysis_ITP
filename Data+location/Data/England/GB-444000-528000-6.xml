		<content> Near Three Gates Farm are boarding    
 kennels which have been in operation  
 since 1977. The kennels are used by   
 people when they are on holiday,      
 working abroad or ill in hospital. At 
 the busiest time of the year, which is
 the summer, there are 25-30 animals   
 being looked after. At the time of our
 visit there were 6 dogs and 3 cats.   
 Animals must be at least 3 months old 
 before they enter the kennels and must
 have had their injections. One Golden 
 Labrador  stayed for two and a half   
 years while the family was abroad.    
 The dogs are kept in indoor kennels   
 and are allowed to use exercise runs  
 and an open paddock on fine days.     
 The owners of the keennels love dogs  
 and train their own champions, German 
 Shepherds and Shippekes (Belgian      
 Barge Dogs).
