		<title>06HOMES IN BRIGG</title>
		<content> A survey of children in our school    
 established that of the 2O8 children  
 interviewed seventy five live in a    
 detached house, sixty five in a       
 semi-detached house, forty seven in a 
 terraced house and seventeen in a     
 detached bungalow.  One lives in a    
 flat and one in a semi detached       
 bungalow and two children live in a   
 childrens' home                       
                                       
 The average size of a home was        
 calculated on the number of bedrooms. 
 Fifteen children live in two bedroom  
 property, one hundred and thirty seven
 in a three bedroom, forty three in a  
 four or more bedroom property.        
 Nearly three quarters said their      
 family had moved at least twice.  Half
 of the families had moved into Brigg  
 from another area.  This is possibly  
 due to the relatively cheap housing.  </content>
