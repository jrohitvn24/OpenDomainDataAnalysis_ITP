		<title>10Old People in Banbury</title>
		<content>   We went to see Vicky Mayo's mum. She
is a warden at Amos Court. A lot of old
people live there. There are 59 flats  
for old people only. In each flat there
are three alarms - one in the bathroom,
one in the living room and one in the  
bedroom. Also in the bathroom there is 
a pole to help you get out of the bath.
The warden took us to look at a flat   
owned by Mrs Henderson. She was a very 
nice lady. She took us round the house 
showing us her rooms. She had a settee 
that turns into a bed. Her room was    
very nice, full of pictures and bright 
flowers.                               
  A lot of old people live in their own
homes. Some live with their children's 
families, but there are a lot of       
sheltered homes and old people's homes 
now because there are a lot more old   
people living longer nowadays.
