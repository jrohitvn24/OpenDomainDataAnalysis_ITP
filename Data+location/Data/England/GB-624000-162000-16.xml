		<content> The Landlady of the{Rising Sun}feels  
 that the villagers get a 'raw deal'   
 from local government. Much could be  
 done to make life more convenient and 
 to give the young a better chance of  
 finding work and making a home in the 
 community. Outsiders do not realise   
 how{isloated}we are, and how much     
 effort must be spent transporting the 
 young and old. Her pub has{14th       
{Century foundations.}It is supposed to
 have a{ghost,}but she has not seen it.
 Tradition has it that it was a sailors
 pub in the days when Stourmouth was   
 more or less an island.Oral tradition:
 Sailors were given a penny if they    
 turned up for church on Sunday, they  
 used to spend it in the pub. Before   
 W.W.2 the building was thatched and   
 the tenant spent most of his time     
 looking for incendiaries on his roof.
