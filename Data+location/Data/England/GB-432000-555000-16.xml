		<title>16HOUSING IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content> I live on an estate of council houses 
 some of which are being bought by the 
 tenants.A typical house has either 2  
 or 3 bedrooms, bathroom and toilet    
 upstairs and living room, kitchen and 
 utility room downstairs. Most have    
 gardens back and front. There are also
 flats and maisonettes in Pennywell.   
 S.Hylton has a nucleus of 18th &amp; 19th 
 century houses and the village centre 
 has terraced houses and cottages.     
 There is an inter war council estate  
 and a recently built estate of        
 detached private housing on the site  
 of the former Ford Paper Mill.        
 Cox Green, on the river, has a variety
 of housing - incl. prefabs and stone  
 built houses.                         
 The parts of Grindon,Castletown and   
 Washington have council housing-those 
 at Washington being "modern" designs.
