  The area is completely rural with no 
urban centres and little or no industry
which is not based on agriculture.     
  This environment does not lend itself
to racialism on the part of the trade  
unions or the socially orientated      
political parties, and it is wholly in 
keeping that the political outlook is  
strongly Conservative, and is likely to
remain so for the forseeable future.   
  The area is situated in the Suffolk  
Coastal constituency, the local        
authority being the Suffolk Coastal    
District Council.
