		<content> A valuable new tourist attraction for 
 Kidderminster is undoubtedly the      
 recently re-opened Severn Valley      
 Railway line linking the British Rail 
 Station at Kidderminster with Bewdley 
 and Bridgnorth. The Bewdley-Bridgnorth
 line was opened in 1974. This railway,
 run mainly by about 400 volunteers,   
 operates a regular steam-hauled       
 passenger train service between       
 Kidderminster and Bridgnorth. Tourists
 and enthusiasts are attracted from all
 over the world. The railway has       
 frequently been the setting for films,
 notably "The Thirty-Nine Steps" and   
 the BBC TV series "God's Wonderful    
 Railway". For children, one of the    
 chief delights is the Santa Special   
 (see page 11).
