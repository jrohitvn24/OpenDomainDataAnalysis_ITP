		<content>  Roger is a fairly small scale farmer 
 with a dairy herd of 50 cows. His day 
 starts at 0630 when  he goes to  milk 
 the cows. He then  feeds  the  calves 
 before having breakfast at about 0830.
{ In summer}his mornings will often be 
 spent cutting hay  or silage while he 
 will spend his afternoons shaking and 
 leading hay.{At harvest time} he will 
 start combining  at about 11 when the 
 grain has dried out and he will carry 
 on  until evening.{In winter}he  will 
 spend the mornings stockfeeding while 
 the afternoons will  be  occupied  in 
 routine maintenance.Afternoon milking 
 takes place from 4 to 5 30.           
  Roger  is  involved  in a variety of 
 outside activities and  his  evenings 
 can   be   spent  at  parish  council 
 meetings or at NFU meetings.Like many 
 farmers, he enjoys playing  bowls. He 
 is also a very keen video cameraman.  </content>
