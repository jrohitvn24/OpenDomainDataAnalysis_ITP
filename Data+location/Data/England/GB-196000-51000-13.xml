		<title>13Local Environment</title>
		<content> Most of the local area is very rural. 
 The largest concentration of people is
 in the village of Trewoon with smaller
 numbers of people in Lanjeth and High 
 Street. There are about a dozen farms 
 within the district but most of them  
 are quite large and have many acres of
 fields between them. The other main   
 feature of the local environment is   
 the China Clay works. The area covered
 by pits, tips or driers is about one  
 quarter of our total study area. Many 
 people would consider that the China  
 Clay industry is destroying the local 
 countryside but most local people are 
 quite proud of the industry and do not
 mind the 'White Mountains'. The effect
 on wildlife is difficult to ascertain 
 because although the pits destroy the 
 natural habitats, the disused tips and
 buildings provide many new ones and   
 plants also flourish.     (Mike Yates)</content>
