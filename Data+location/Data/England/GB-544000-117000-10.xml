		<title>10Lavender Line, Isfield.</title>
		<content>  {Isfield Station}was closed in 1967. 
 It was left until 1983 when it was    
 bought by a local family who have     
 transformed it to a working{'museum'. 
   The basic structure of the buildings
 was stable but a lot of things had    
 been taken from the site. People took 
 souvenirs but many were returned when 
 they heard about the{restoration work 
 which began by taking 2 tons of growth
 from the platforms and vegetation from
 the tracks. The signal box was then   
 renovated and the perimeter fencing   
 replaced. The Main Booking Hall needed
 more attention; ceilings were replaced
 and walls sandblasted.                
   A lot of hard work by the family and
 about 20 regular{volunteers}has made  
 the Line &amp; its locos. an{attraction   
 for local people &amp; tourists. The owner
 feels that the Station has had a good 
 effect on the village community.      </content>
