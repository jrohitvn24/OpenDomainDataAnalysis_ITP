		<title>13Three Schools Sports Day</title>
		<content> In North Bedfordshire there are many  
 small village schools of less than 50 
 children aged 4 to 9 years. Every year
 we have a joint Sports Day with two   
 small schools,Colmworth and Wilden.   
 We take it in turns to have Sports Day
 at our own school.This year it was our
 turn to invite them to come to our    
 school field. We start with sprint    
 races for all. Then come the novelty  
 races -a hoop race, bucket and beanbag
 race, potato and spoon race and an    
 obstacle race. After that there is a  
 novelty relay in which each team has 5
 children, one from each year.The      
 oldest one waits in the middle of the 
 track, the other 4 are at the start.  
 They run taking with them in turn a   
 hat, case, umbrella and boots to the  
 waiting child, who puts on the hat and
 boots and carries the bag and umbrella
 to the finish.It is great fun.        </content>
