		<title>11WHEATHAM FARM,Steep Marsh,1</title>
		<content>{HISTORICAL BACKGROUND}                
 The farm lies just north of Steep     
 Marsh It is mentioned in the Domesday 
 Book .The house itself is mainly      
 fifteenth century and had connections 
 with a former nunnery at Liss Place.  
 Many people believe there is a secret 
 passage between the house and the old 
 nunnery.In some places you can see    
 mullioned windows and local stone is  
 very plentiful. There are also very   
 large corner stones and some very old 
 bricks laid diagonally .There are     
 ships beams inside and two dungeons   
 one beneath the other. On the site    
 there are the remains of an oast      
 house.The word Wheatham is Saxon and  
 plenty of remains of former times have
 been found in the soil around.The farm
 has about 200 acres(not including the 
 Hangers are also a part of Wheatham   
 Farm).                                </content>
