		<content>  A visit to the{Davern Workwear,      
{Easterly Manufacturing Company}helped 
 us to see how a{factory works.        
  We saw a{boiler suit}being made.     
 First of all{cardboard patterns}were  
 drawn round on{.x}paper.Then all the  
 patterns were cut out by one man who  
 showed us his{chain mail}glove.This   
 protects his hand from the{blade}which
 can cut through{200 layers}of material
 at one time just as if it were butter.
  Next the{pattern pieces}were moved to
 the{machine room}on trolleys.There we 
 saw a pocket and all the garment      
 pieces joined together.We went to the 
{finishing room}to watch a lady using a
{stud machine}putting{press studs}on   
 the suits.She did it faster than we   
 could believe. All the{workwear }was  
 checked,then packed ready for sale.If 
 anything was wrong it went back to the
 person who made it. Michelle Baker.   </content>
