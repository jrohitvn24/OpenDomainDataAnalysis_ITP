		<content> After we get up the first meal is     
 obviously breakfast.Most people have a
 slice or two of toast and a bowl of   
 cereal such as "Cornflakes" "Rice     
 Krispies" or "Shredded Wheat". Some   
 people have boiled eggs or bacon and  
 fried eggs often with tomato and      
 mushroom. Dinner or lunch comes next  
 the difference between these two being
 that lunch tends to be a cold meal    
 whereas dinner is normally a cooked   
 meal. In the summer a lot of people   
 have salad for lunch and a cooked     
 meal at teatime. Most peoples Sunday  
 lunches are different however with    
 meat roast potatoes and vegetables.   
 Most homes have a freezer and some    
 foods can be bought frozen and heated 
 in either an electric or gas oven or a
 microwave oven.Sometimes complete     
 meals prepared this way can be eaten  
 on your lap as you watch television.  </content>
