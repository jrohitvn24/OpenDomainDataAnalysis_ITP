		<title>04Crocadon Farm History</title>
		<content>    Crocadon most probably is recorded 
 in the original Doomsday book. Local  
 records acknowledge its existence     
 since 1237. In the{seventeenth century
 there was a fire which destroyed much 
 of the farmhouse. The owner-occupiers 
 then were the Tillie family. They     
 considered it unlucky to continue     
 living there so they built Pentillie  
 castle on the banks of the river      
 Tamar, 1\ miles away. Most of the     
 estate has sinced remained in the     
 Tillie/Coryton family.                
  At the start of the{twentieth century
 much of{Viverdon Down}was reclaimed   
 and incorperated into the estate. Mr  
 Bush has been the tenant since 1970.  
 He no longer uses part of the large   
 farmhouse or the old{farm buildings}. 
 Most of the doorways are too low,     
 indicating that modern man is much    
 taller than even 200 years ago.       </content>
