		<title>06My old house by James G</title>
		<content>   My old house,St.Lawrence Chapel,is  
 about eight hundred years old.It      
 used to be an inn for the pilgrims.   
 Travellers used to stop for a drink of
 water and a piece of bread or to stay 
 for the night .                       
   The house was then turned into a    
 Chapel and priests came to pray there.
 Once,half of the Chapel burned down   
 so they had to build it up again.     
   Some men dug a tunnel from the house
 to the river but about three hundred  
 years ago it collapsed with two people
 in it.Later on,as some men filled in  
 a cellar,one man slipped and his legs 
 were chopped off to release him.      
   Other old houses in Halling include 
 Pring's Cottage,Clements Farm,Court   
 Lodge Farmhouse,The Black Boy Public  
 House,Manor Farm House and Bourne     
 House.   {
