		<content> There is some development of council  
 estates taking place at the moment    
 around Pleasley. It was revealed that 
 first time house buyers, mainly young 
 couples , tended to go for the        
 terraced two bedroomed houses as a    
 "stepping stone" to a detached house  
 with a garage.                        
 In order to be in keeping with the    
 environment several new houses had to 
 be built in natural stone to blend in 
 with the village church and other     
 older buildings,so they did not look  
 out of place and blended in with      
 the surroundings.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
