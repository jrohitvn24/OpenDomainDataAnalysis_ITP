		<title>05Population _ Leck area</title>
		<content> Population has gone down a lot from   
 what it was in the past.The number of 
 farm workrs has gone down because     
 machinery has taken over.There used to
 be three shops but now there is just  
 one because we have got cars and other
 vehicles to travel to places like     
 Kirkby,Kendal and Lancaster.Houses    
 have been made into holiday cottages  
 and in the winter months they stand   
 empty.There aren't so many servants in
 big houses any more because of the    
 equipment for example,hoovers,washing 
 machines and irons etc.These are some 
 of the reasons why the population has 
 fallen.In Cowan Bridge,Leck,Over Town 
 and Burrow,in the census returns for  
 1881 there were 174 adults and 85     
 children.In the 1985 Register of      
 Electors there are about 76 adults and
 22 children.
