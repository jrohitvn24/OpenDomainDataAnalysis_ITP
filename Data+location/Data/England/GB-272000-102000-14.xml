		<content>     Clannaborough today is only a     
 quaint church used infrequently for   
 services, and an adjacent farm, just  
 off the road from Copplestone to Bow. 
 However it has a history which goes   
 back to pre-Roman times. It stands on 
 the Celtic trackway north of Dartmoor,
 and the unusual circular churchyard   
 may well have been a pre-Christian    
 worshipping site.                     
     It is mentioned in the Domesday   
 Book as Cloenesberg, held by Ralph of 
 Pomeroy from Baldwin; Godman the      
 priest held it before 1066; value 25  
 shillings.  In 1239 it was called     
 Clovenberge, which means "Cloven      
 hill".  Until recently, the parish was
 one of the smallest in the country,   
 just 1 mile wide and 6 miles long. It 
 is now in the parish of Down St Mary.
