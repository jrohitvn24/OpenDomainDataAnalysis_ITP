		<title>03Historic Buildings</title>
		<content> There is a great wealth of historic   
 buildings in the area, in addition to 
 the churches and the village has been 
 designated as a Conservation Area.    
 This means that all the buildings of  
 historic importance will be retained  
 and improved. Any new buildings will  
 have to be constructed of materials   
 appropriate to the neighbourhood.     
 Every effort will be made to retain   
 all existing hedgerows and trees. All 
 the cast iron hydrants in the village 
 will be preserved. There are a total  
 of 43 buildings in the village that   
 have been listed as being of          
 importance by the Department of       
 Environment. In addition to these many
 others are considered to be important 
 buildings and this includes the       
 Baptist Chapel and the Lower School.
