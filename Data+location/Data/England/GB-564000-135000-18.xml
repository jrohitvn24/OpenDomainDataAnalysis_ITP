		<title>18Owl House and The Pottery</title>
		<content>{ The Owl House}is a tourist attraction
 in{Lamberhurst}mainly because of the  
 beautiful{gardens,}created by the     
 Marchioness of Dufferin. However, the 
 cottage, which is over 500 years old, 
 was the centre for wool smugglers who 
 operated at night and their warning   
 hoots gave the name "Owlers". The     
 chimney is said to be the crookedest  
 in Kent. At{Hook Green,}a local man   
 has converted old tractor sheds into  
 his own{pottery.}He and his wife      
 produce a fine range of domestic      
 pottery; practical, yet nonetheless   
 very attractive. The powdered clay is 
 delivered and then the potter makes up
 his own mixture to suit the plates,   
 dishes, beakers, jugs or teapots that 
 he hand throws on the electric wheel. 
 Gas, electric or wood kilns fire the  
 clay before and after glazing. Sales  
 are made from within the pottery.     </content>
