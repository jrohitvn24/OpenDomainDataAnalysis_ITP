		<title>03Chatteris - Pumping Stations</title>
		<content> When Vermuyden drained the area, the  
 peat shrank and we found that the land
 would not drain naturally, so the     
 Dutch brought their windmills and     
 people to look after them.  These     
 windmills were replaced by steam      
 pumps.  Nowadays, the drainage men    
 told us, nearly all pumps are         
 electric.  This area has two drainage 
 districts, Nightlayer's and Normoor.  
 All the little drains that criss cross
 the farmland carry water to the Forty 
 Foot drain, and the water is pumped by
 an electric pump.  No one looks after 
 this pump and the farmers have to pay 
 Nightlayer's drainage district for    
 this.  The Normoor pumping station on 
 the Sixteen Foot Bank is no longer    
 working.  The farmer said that the old
 engine worked by disel and if the     
 pumps were switched off we  would all 
 be underwater very soon.              </content>
