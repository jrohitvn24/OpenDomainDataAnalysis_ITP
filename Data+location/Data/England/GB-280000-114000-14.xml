		<title>14THE TAW VALE BEAGLES</title>
		<content> The Taw Vale beagles have their       
 headquarters at Cannington farm.There 
 are sixty five hounds most of which   
 are beagles and the rest are          
 foxhounds.They belong to a group of   
 farmers who together pay for them.It  
 can cost up to Â£2000 a year.Feeding   
 and caring for them takes up to about 
 three hours a day.The dogs are given  
 one meal a day which is usually tripe.
 They are given a run when their       
 kennels are cleaned out.Hunting takes 
 place in the autumn and there are     
 usually three or four events a week.  
 Young beagles are trained by chaininga
 young dog to an older dog until they  
 have learned to hunt with the         
 pack.They usually hunt hares.On a hunt
 day they bring the hounds to the      
 meeting place and let them out to find
 the hare.
