		<title>20Conclusion-about the Project</title>
		<content> The B.B.C.{Domesday Project}has been  
 very worthwhile according to all the  
 children who took part in collecting  
 the data for the survey.              
 Most of the surveyors enjoyed the     
 time they spent talking to people     
 about the area today. Most enjoyable  
 seemed to be talking to the older     
 generation about how times have       
 changed in the past sixty years.      
 Also the project has given them the   
 chance to talk to adults in a         
 different way than they sometimes do: 
 it has given them an opportunity to   
 talk to them in an "adult" way and    
 they have learnt the importance of    
 asking serious and structured         
 questions.                            
 The project has also made the         
 participants more aware of some of the
 issues that affect their community    
 today.                                </content>
