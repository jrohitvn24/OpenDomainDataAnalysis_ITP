		<title>04Our Visit To Jaguar</title>
		<content> On Monday the 8th of July we went to  
 the Jaguar car factory. When we got   
 there Mr. Robottom welcomed us and    
 told us a bit about the history of the
 company. We watched a film showing how
 the cars are made. Then a student     
 showed us around the training         
 department. We had to wear goggles    
 when we went into the  different sorts
 of rooms because we had to protect our
 eyes. We went downstairs to the 6O    
 shop to see the robots. The factory   
 was big and smelled of glue and oil.  
 There was a noise of machines all the 
 time. Jaguar cars are sometimes called
 Big Cats after their symbol, a leaping
 Jaguar.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
