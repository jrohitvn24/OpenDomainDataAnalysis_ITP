		<title>07     Kestle Mill</title>
		<content>  Kestle Mill is situated about four   
 miles from Newquay,on the main road   
 between St. Austell and Newquay.      
 We couldn't find out the meaning of   
 the word Kestle, but there was a water
 mill in the centre of the village that
 was  used until the 1950s.The mill was
 used to crush the grain from the farms
 around the area.                      
   We visited some of the people who   
 lived in Kestle Mill.There are eight  
 cottages in the lane.Most of the      
 people have moved there in the last   
 five years. They have modernised the  
 old farmworkers' cottages.            
   Some of the cottages are  made of   
 stone and others have cob walls.      
 Mrs May was very interesting to talk  
 to. She has lived there for 54 years. 
 She showed us some old photographs    
 including one of the Sunday School.
