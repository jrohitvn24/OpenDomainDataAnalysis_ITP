		<content> Every year our school has a camp at   
 which we all take part in sailing. We 
 have l7 boats altogether, we also have
 l5 two-man tents which we use every   
 year. Our Headmaster is a brilliant   
 sailor. We usually go on sailing camp 
 in June because that gives us time to 
 save up our money. It cost us Â£l2     
 including all of our dinners. This    
 year about forty children went so we  
 had to hire a few tents. We have a    
 test every year which includes capsize
 drill. There is a bar at the Club so  
 at night we can buy drinks and        
 crisps.There are also a few           
 windsurfers. We have one swing and    
 a sandpit. We have two old lorry      
 innertubes and we have races on them. 
 I shared a tent with my best friend   
 Claire. We go in groups depending on  
 what certificates we are doing. I got 
 my R.Y.A. Junior Two Certificate.     </content>
