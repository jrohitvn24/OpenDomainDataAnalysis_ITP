		<title>08BRANSTON OLD HALL</title>
		<content> Branston Old Hall was built in 1735 by
 Lord Vere Bertie. After the Enclosure 
 Act of 1765 he was the largest        
 landowner. His land stretched as far  
 as the River Witham. As far as we know
 the Melville family were the last     
 family to live in the Hall. Alexander 
 Leslie Melville built the present Hall
 in 1885 and there was a fire there on 
 Jan.1st 1903.Alexander lived in the   
 Hall till his death in 1919.The       
 Melville family lived in Branston from
 1883 till 1922.In 1887 the Hon.       
 A.L.Melville built a school on Hall   
 Lane in which 70 children             
 enrolled.Later it became an infant    
 school. Lindsey County Council later  
 bought the Hall and used it for a     
 sanatorium. In 1983 Branston Hall     
 became a retirement home.
