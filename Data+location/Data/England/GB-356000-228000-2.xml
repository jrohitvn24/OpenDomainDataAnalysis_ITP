		<title>02MR. BELLAMY - A FARMER</title>
		<content> Mr Bellamy has a farm of{400 acres    
 which he rents from the{Arranstone    
 Estate.   His{family have farmed it   
{for over 100 years.   25 years ago    
 there were{8 men and 14 horses}working
 on the land;  now there are{2 men}who 
 work for Mr Bellamy{and 5 tractors.}He
 does not think the land could be      
 worked with fewer men.  He works{7    
{days a week, the 2 men work for 5     
{days a week.  }It is a{mixed farm,    
 with{30 beef cattle}and crops of      
{potatoes, corn}and{sugar beet. }He    
 thinks the{EEC subsidies}for farmers  
 are{necessary,}but{distributed very   
{badly.}He does not think there is much
 hope of the system being improved.    
 He has pulled out a number of{hedges  
 over the years, but won't pull any    
 more as it makes the fields too open  
 and exposed to the weather.   He does 
 not believe in change without reason. </content>
