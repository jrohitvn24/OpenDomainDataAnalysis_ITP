		<title>11MY HOME - A CONVERTED CHAPEL</title>
		<content> Our chapel, which was built in 1840,  
 used to be a Wesleyan chapel. There is
 another converted chapel up the road  
 which was also Methodist but of the   
 Bible Christian branch.Because they   
 did not agree with each other ,people 
 used to call the two chapels "Spite   
 and Envy".   The chapel up the road   
 was soon made into the Sunday School  
 as there were not enough people for   
 two churches.There had only been one  
 wedding there and that was the Griffin
 wedding. There are{NOT people buried  
 in the garden.The last service was in 
 1963. In 1967 it was sold for Â£180 to 
 the council. We bought it for Â£4800 in
 1973. We still have the old door and  
 windows.
