		<content> THE M4.                               
  Opened in I968 this is part of the   
 main road route between London and    
 South Wales.In this area it is less   
 than 10 miles from the interchange    
 with the M5.Motorways were planned to 
 take the straightest and most level   
 routes, but here there is a steep     
 gradient up the scarp slope , to meet 
 the A46 at the top at Tormarton.      
   Beside this intersection is the Avon
 County Council Highways HQ where the  
 County Surveyor is based. He looks    
 after over 800 miles of road in       
 Avon,making sure that they are in good
 condition,that the signs are          
 up-to-date and dealing with gritting  
 problems in Winter. In 1985 the County
 Council has been concentrating on     
 resurfacing.
