		<content> which continued to be the main        
 occupation on the rich soil of the    
 coastal plain. The heritage of this   
 traditional way of life is found in   
 the garden centres,market gardens,    
 nurseries and mushroom farms          
 which supply London and local markets.
 Today it is a peaceful, quiet         
 residential area where most of the    
 houses have attractive gardens. It is 
 a wonderful place for the old and     
 young, with a wide range of facilities
 including shops, doctors ,dentists and
 a vet.                                
      Part of East Preston is now      
 called Angmering On Sea. This is      
 because until 1965 there used to be a 
 workhouse in East Preston. The rich   
 people didn't like this so they       
 preferred to call the coastal area    
 Angmering On Sea.
