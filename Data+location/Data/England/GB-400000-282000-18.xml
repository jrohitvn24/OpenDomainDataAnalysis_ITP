We visited the Adult Training Centre   
near school. It has 170 men &amp; women,   
aged between 18 &amp; 45, all of whom are  
mentally &amp; physically handicapped.     
They are trained to wash, dress, shop, 
travel &amp; cook by themselves. Everyone  
at the Centre is encouraged to take    
part in outside activities. There is a 
waiting list of people to join the     
centre. The Centre has a budget of     
between 7000 &amp; 8000 pounds per year.   
This costs the ratepayer a lot of      
money. The Centre has a large workshop 
which has been sub-divided into areas  
where people can do needlework,        
woodwork or metal work. There is also  
a gardening room where various plants  
are grown and where most of the        
equipment has been made in the         
woodwork area. There are 10 members of 
staff and some extra helpers.          </content>
