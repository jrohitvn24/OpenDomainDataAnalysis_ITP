		<content>{    In 1985 we have childrens tables  
 in groups,no teachers desks,brightly  
 decorated walls,and very little use of
 a blackboard if any.A computer bleeps 
 away in one quiet corner with a group 
 of children absorbed with its monitor.
     Other groups of children are      
 working with calculators,or writing   
 their stories with roller ball pens.  
     A carpet lies in one corner of the
 room with a few children sitting      
 relaxed on cushions enjoying colourful
 books,while a few more paint in       
 another corner,using bright glorious  
 colours.                              
     Most classes have pets of some    
 kind, gerbils, rabbits or guinea pigs 
 for example, and the children take    
 care of them. The atmosphere is       
 relaxed and friendly.
