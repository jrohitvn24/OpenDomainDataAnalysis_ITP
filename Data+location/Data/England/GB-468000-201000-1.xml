		<content>Within this predominantly farming area 
there are a few isolated farmhouses and
the village of Tetsworth.              
St.Gile's church, built on a hill, is a
familiar sight to travellers on the M40
between Oxford and the Chiltern Hills. 
Those who take 'the old London Road'   
the A40-will discover Tetsworth is a   
small village built mainly along and to
the south of the road. On the north    
side there are a few houses, a village 
green,Inn, school and chapel. Just     
outside the village is Attington Stud,a
small estate specialising in breeding  
race horses.                           
In the N.E.corner of the area is Thame 
Park, a private estate. From the road  
one can see the ruins of the monastery 
destroyed in the time of Henry VIII. To
the south of the area lies the Copcourt
Estate including a moated manor house.
