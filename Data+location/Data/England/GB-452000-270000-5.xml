    Mr.Start and a friend built a big  
 pot. It took them one month. It took  
 them 75 hours each and they worked 3  
 hours a night. The pot was made on a  
 Potter's Wheel. We were allowed to    
 look in it. It is over 7 feet high and
 weighs 1\ tons. The circumference is  
 17 feet and the diameter is over 5    
 feet. One handle of the pot costs Â£60.
 Mr.Start has been at the work shop for
 9 years. He usually makes Terracotta  
 which is gardenware. He uses chimney  
 clay.                                 
  {The Kiln}                           
    There is a very big kiln. When is  
 is firing pots it has to be bricked   
 up. It hasn't got a proper door. The  
 garden pots are very good and would   
 look good in the garden. The pots are 
 all coil pots, even the big pot.
