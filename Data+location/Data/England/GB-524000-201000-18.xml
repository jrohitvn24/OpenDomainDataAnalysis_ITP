		<title>18A Hobby</title>
		<content>   A hobby of mine is BMXing, it is    
 where you ride a bike and do tricks.  
 The tricks I do are:- wheelies,       
 backhops, wheelhops and many more     
 tricks. I do all the tricks at Elm    
 Court, Potters Bar. At Elm Court there
 is one trick ramp and a quarterpump.  
 I do quite a lot of maintenance on my 
 bike like fixing punchers and getting 
 new brake boxes. My BMX is called a   
 Tuff Burner and it is good for stunts.
 I like doing BMXing, a lot of my      
 friends do it and think it is very    
 good. Quite a lot of people I know    
 think BMXing is going out of          
 fashion, but I don't.
