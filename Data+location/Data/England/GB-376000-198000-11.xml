 fields.Many people earned their living
 by working on the land.               
  There were several shops;three of    
 them were Butchers,one was a Bakers   
 and there was a Post Office,Garage    
 Sweet Shop and a Hairdressers.Bread   
 was baked and delivered daily by horse
 and cart.Milk was also delivered from 
 a farm.Customers had their jugs filled

 because there wasn't any gas or       
 electricity.There was an open drain   
 down The Street and no sewer in the   
 village.For entertainment the big
