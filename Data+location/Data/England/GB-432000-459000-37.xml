<content>

Policing by a rural beat officer has been replaced by a Safer Neighbourhood Officer whose area includes Brearton, Scotton, Lingerfield and Farnham amongst many other villages in the Claro Ward, Marston Moor Ward and Scriven Park Ward.&lt;br />This officer liaises with the Neighbourhood Watch Coordinators, Farmwatch Members, Gamekeepers, Pubs Schools, Churches and Parish Councils and sets up Neighbourhood Watches, Farmwatches and gives talks to the school children including 'Stranger Danger', 'Anti Bullying' and Internet Safety. This is in addition to patrolling the area and dealing with any crimes/incidents reported to them or as they come across them.&lt;br />Response Officers will also attend to incidents reported by the villagers when the Safer Neighbourhood Officer is on or off duty.   &lt;br />
