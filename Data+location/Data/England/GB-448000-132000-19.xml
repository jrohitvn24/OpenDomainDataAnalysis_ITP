		<title>19Living in Easton Village</title>
		<content>{Easton}is a small,quiet village but   
 has quite an active life. Although    
 there are a great many old people     
 there are younger people and families 
 too ,as can be seen by the            
 enthusiastic group who attend the     
 thriving{Youth Club.                  
 There are no shops in Easton but food 
 is delivered by stores in Winchester, 
 there is a market garden and the      
 Mobile Library comes twice a week.    
 There is a{Cricket club,}a{Darts team 
 and other activities organised by the 
 church and Youth club.                
 Many of the people who live there were
 born there and cannot imagine living  
 anywhere else but there are newcomers 
 who are also finding it a very        
 pleasant place to live.
