		<title>12SUNDAY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   On Sunday I go to Sunday School. It 
 is connected with Bishops Itchington  
{St. Michael's Church.} I first of all 
 get my collection money and on the way
 to the church I call for Christopher  
 Taylor.  At ll.OO a.m. we both walk up
 to the church together.  When we get  
 there we put our collection in the pot
 before anyone else can.  Mrs. Timms   
 the{Sunday School teacher}starts to   
 tell us some interesting stories, and 
 facts about{Jesus Christ.}            
    At l2.OO noon they give us all a   
 leaflet and in this leaflet are       
 questions on what we have learnt this 
 week.  Once we have got our leaflet we
 set off for home.  At home I get a pen
 and start on my leaflet.  Sometimes I 
 have to get my{Bible}and look up a    
 passage to get some of the answers.   
 Next week if it is correct I will get 
 a star on the star chart.             </content>
