		<title>03Education in Holbeach Bank</title>
		<content> There were schools in Moulton Seas End
 and Saracen's Head but they have been 
 closed down. Holbeach Bank school is  
 the only one that exists in our block 
 although there are play schools in the
 other villages. In Holbeach Bank      
 School there are 72 children  and 3   
 teachers. Mrs Norris is the secretary 
 and she comes for 1 and a half days a 
 week.Miss Jefferson is the headteacher
 and also she teaches the children     
 beetween 9 and 11 years old. Mrs      
 Christensen is the teacher of the 6 to
 9 year olds.Mrs Currington is the     
 infants teacher.There have been       
 extensions built on the school since  
 it was built.The infants' classroom   
 was built later and so were the hall  
 and toilets.Some of the children come 
 on the bus,some come on the taxi,some 
 walk or come on bicycles or in cars.
