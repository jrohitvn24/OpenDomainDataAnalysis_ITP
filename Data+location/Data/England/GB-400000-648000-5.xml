		<title>05Events in Scremerston.</title>
		<content> The two main events held each year in 
 Scremerston are the{Church Garden     
{Party}held in the grounds of{Kiwi     
{Cottage,Scremerston}and the{Gala}held 
 on the School Field.                  
 The Church Garden Party is organised  
 by the Vicar and Church Council. The  
 Gala was first held in 1977 when a    
 group of parents got together to      
 organise the Jubilee Celebrations. Now
 it is organised by a committee of the 
 various organisations in the area of  
 the village and all the proceeds are  
 shared by these clubs and             
 organisations.                        
      Each organisation puts on a stall
 or sideshow but most of the work is   
 done by the{Parents' Association}of   
 the School and the  Youth Club. Page 6
 gives full details of the Gala held in
 1985 and this account was written by  
 the children of the School.           </content>
