 FROM THE AGE OF 7-11.  CUB SCOUTS DO  
 VARIOUS ACTIVITIES SUCH AS CAMPING.   
 THERE IS A BROWNIES GROUP FOR GIRLS   
 FROM THE AGE OF 7-11.  WHEN YOU LEAVE 
 BROWNIES YOU MAY SOMETIMES WANT TO GO 
 TO GUIDES WHICH IS FOR GIRLS FROM THE 
 AGE OF 11-15.  GUIDES OFTEN GO CAMPING
 BECAUSE THERE IS A WEEK CAMP AND A    
 WEEKEND CAMP.  BILLINGHAY HAS A LOCAL 
 PLAYING FIELD WHERE THERE IS A SLIDE, 
 SOME SWINGS, A SEE-SAW AND A ROCKING  
 HORSE.  A SLIDE IS AN OBSTACLE WHICH  
 HAS STEPS.  YOU CLIMB UP THE STEPS AND
 SLIDE DOWN A SHEET OF WOOD OR METAL TO
 GET TO THE BOTTOM.  BILLINGHAY ALSO   
 HAS AN OUTDOOR SWIMMING POOL WHICH    
 OPENS FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS IN THE
