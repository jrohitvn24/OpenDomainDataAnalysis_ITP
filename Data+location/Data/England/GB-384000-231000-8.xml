		<title>08DEVELOPMENT IN FORTHAMPTON</title>
		<content> Forthampton's Parish Council meets    
 irregularly throughout the year       
 generally to discuss threats of       
 impending development. Almost every   
 building is of historic interest and  
 feelings amongst local people are     
 intense regarding preservation and    
 change. The two barns of Corner House 
 Farm were sympathetically renovated in
 1983 but there has been controversy in
 1985 over the building of two new     
 houses between the barns and Brewers  
 cottage.  These houses are totally out
 of character with the village but     
 local feeling was thwarted. The Estate
 has to be run along commercial lines  
 and in this instance the locals feel  
 that commerce has outmanoeuvred       
 concern for harmony. Planning         
 permission, with local support, has   
 just been granted to fully restore    
 Southfield House.                     </content>
