		<content>Most of the people interviewed in our  
survey are very content with the area  
as it is at present.When asked what    
quality or feature of life appealed to 
them several phrases constantly        
recurred:"unspoilt countryside" "peace 
and serenity".Most of the residents    
considered that the area would remain  
largely unchanged and with the existing
pattern of landowning agencies this    
would appear to be likely.During the   
course of our survey we asked a leading
question:"What do you think the people 
of the future would find most          
attractive about the Oakenclough area?"
Most of the replies to the question    
reflected the belief that future people
will be in greater need of the peace   
and serenity of the area than          
themselves.One or two young persons    
brought up in this locality said they  
would not wish to live anywhere else.  </content>
