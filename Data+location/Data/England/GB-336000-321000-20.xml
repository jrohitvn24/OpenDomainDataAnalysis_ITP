{RUYTON CARNIVAL (contd)}              
 of the carnival.    The draw is in the
 safe hands of Mr. R. Penton as is the 
 erection of banners and bunting which 
 is put up across the road through the 
 village two weeks before the big      
 event, getting everyone into the      
 spirit of the occasion.               
{My House and Me - Rhys Williams}      
 My house is a nice house with a good  
 view of a hill. It is up a steep      
 little lane.  We have a big garden    
 with a wood behind.  It is quite a big
 house but it is called a cottage. I   
 have a BMX bike for doing stunts.  I  
 am not very good yet but everything   
 needs practise.  When there is nothing
 else to do I play on the computer.
