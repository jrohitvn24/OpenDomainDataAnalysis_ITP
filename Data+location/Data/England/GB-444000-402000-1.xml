 Our area is a small mining community. 
 It is a reasonably close and friendly 
 area consisting of working class      
 people, most of the men are employed  
 by the{National Coal Board.}          
 The majority of women in our community
 work in factories and shops but some  
 have a small part time job, or are    
 housewives.  Most of the land around  
 us is farmland and slag heaps.  Our   
 community is slowly changing because  
 of the rise in unemployment due to the
 closing down of{collieries}in our     
 community, and lack of further        
 investment in new industries.         
 In five or more years our community   
 could be an area without much work at 
 all which will make it hard for the   
 people who have just left school and  
 are looking for jobs, because it will 
 be nearly impossible to find work.    </content>
