		<content> The  Harris  Brush  Company  of  Stoke
 Prior  bought  most  of  the  36 acres
 covered by Cobblers  Coppice  in 1946.
 The area  was{cleared}and{replanted}in
 about 1948. The  pond indicated on the
 O.S. map has been filled in, partly by
 the dumping  of refuse. Today, notices
 warn   of  the   penalty  for  dumping
 rubbish. Each {Autumn, }workmen  clear
 out  the  wood  using  hand  tools and
 machines, but  no {herbicides.}Several
{straight  tracks }are  kept  clear  to
 allow {authorised access.}As the  wood
 is  well{fenced, }there is  no  public
 access and  the area is rich in plants
 and insects. The main  trees today are
 Sycamore,  Beech,  Silver Birch, Lime,
 Alder, Ash and  Hazel. There are a few
 conifers  and some  Holly and Hawthorn
 seedlings.Bramble,Dogrose,Honeysuckle,
 nettles, Cleavers, Burdock and Campium
 are among the  most common wild flora.</content>
