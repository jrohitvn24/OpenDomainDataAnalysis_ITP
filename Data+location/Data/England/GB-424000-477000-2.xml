 HAVE LIVED AT SOUTH VIEW FARM, BINSOE,
 A LITTLE HAMLET NEAR WEST TANFIELD ALL
 MY LIFE.MY DAD TERRY IS A TENNANT     
 FARMER ON THE BOURNE_ARTON ESTATE.OUR 
 FARM IS 50 ACRES. AS WE ARE A SMALL   
 FARM, ALL THE FAMILY HAVE TO LEND A   
 HAND.WHEN IT IS MILKING TIME I GO ON  
 THE TRACTOR AND "FAN"OUR DOG COMES    
 WITH ME.WE GO DOWN THE FIELDS TO WHERE
 THE FREISIAN COWS ARE.I TELL FAN TO   
 "COME BY",AND SHE ROUNDS THE COWS UP.I
 TELL HER TO "TOUCH THEM"AND SHE NIPS  
 THE BACKS OF THE COWS'LEGS AND THEY   
 WALK TOWARDS THE GATE.WE DRIVE THEM UP
 TO THE COLLECTING YARD. MEANWHILE     
 MOTHER IS PREPARING THE MILK UNITS AND
 MY SISTER HELEN IS FILLING BUCKETS    
 WITH ROLLED BARLEY,FOR THE COWS.OUR   
 COWS ARE MILKED TWICE A DAY.
