		<title>10TRANSPORT - THE A396</title>
		<content> The{A396 Tiverton to Exeter road}runs 
 through this area. It carries a       
 continuous flow of mixed traffic      
 including coaches, heavy lorries, cars
 and local farm traffic, with a        
 noticeable increase in summer. This   
 part of the A396 is marked as a       
{holiday route}taking traffic from the 
 new Link Road from the M5 to North    
 Cornwall. It is narrow and winding in 
 this section, and is not,in the       
 opinion of many local people, entirely
 suitable for the weight of traffic    
 encouraged to use it, particularly    
 when slow farm vehicles are forced to 
 compete with holiday traffic. This can
 create a dangerous situation. There is
 a regular{bus service}- 14 buses to   
 Tiverton per day.
