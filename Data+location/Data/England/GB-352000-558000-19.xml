		<title>19Education - local play group</title>
		<content> A thriving, well run play-group is    
 open on two mornings a week in the    
 Milton Village Hall. Children from    
 nearby communities and from Brampton  
 attend. It caters for about 20        
 children whose ages range from about 2
 and a half to five years old.         
 There is one paid person in charge and
 one paid helper, with one mother also 
 helping at each session on a rota     
 basis. The children choose from a     
 large range of activities, painting,  
 doing puzzles, modelling, playing with
 sand, water and toys, or in the play  
 house. There is no formal education,  
 though children are encouraged to     
 listen to stories, look at picture    
 books and join in singing and games   
 activities. Parents pay for each      
 session the child attends and some    
 financial help is organised through   
 the Play Group Association.           </content>
