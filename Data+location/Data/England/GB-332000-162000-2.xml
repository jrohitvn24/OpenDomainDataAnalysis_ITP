		<title>02Worlebury Hill</title>
		<content> Worlebury Hill is a large hill covered
 with woodland.The woods were planted  
 in 1823 by Smyth Piggot,who was one of
 the wealthy people in Weston at the   
 time.Some of the most common trees in 
 the woods are the Oak,Sycamore and    
 Ash.Before the woods were planted     
 mining for lead and calamine was very 
 popular.A long time before that there 
 was an Iron Age Hill Fort,but         
 unfortunately you can only see the    
 remains today.It was inhabited by the 
 Celts.To defend themselves the Celts  
 made four ditches and walls repeated  
 after each other.When they dug the big
 ditches they piled all the stones up  
 behind them to make the walls.        
 Eventually it was thought that the    
 Romans took over the Hill Fort and    
 destroyed it.We think this because    
 some people found a skull with eight  
 or nine sword wounds in it.           </content>
