		<content> Some of the grass crop is field dried 
 and made into hay which is baled for  
 storage. Nowadays more is conserved   
 green as silage for stock feeding in  
 winter and is stored in clamps, tower 
 silos and, more recently in half-tonne
 capacity plastic bags.                
                                       
 There are few dairy farms and the main
 livestock enterprises are beefcattle  
 and sheep. The beef cattle are housed 
 in winter and the present trend is for
 sheep to be brought in to covered     
 yards prior to lambing.
