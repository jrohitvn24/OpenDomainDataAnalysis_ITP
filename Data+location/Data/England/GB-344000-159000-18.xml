{DISTANT ENTERTAINMENT:} In towns and  
 cities cinemas show films at certain  
 times and some films are for any age, 
 but sometimes they are for the over   
 15's. There are also theatres where   
 performances of plays and musical     
 shows are held live. There are also   
 pop song concerts. These take place in
 the city of Bristol and the town of   
 Weston-Super-Mare.
