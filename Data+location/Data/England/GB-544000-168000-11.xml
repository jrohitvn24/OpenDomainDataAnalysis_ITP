		<content>People interviewed in the St.Pauls Cray
area of Orpington held strong views on 
the following public amenities.        
SHOPS.They would like to see an        
improved shopping area with a greater  
variety of merchandise of better       
quality.This could take the form of a  
shopping precinct from which cars are  
banned.At the moment,cars are parked   
anywhere which is dangerous for        
children and old people.               
GRAFFITI.There should be a campaign    
against graffiti,because at the moment 
graffiti ruins the appearance of many  
local buildings.Heavy fines were       
suggest as a deterent.                 
LEISURE.Many people felt that there was
need for a leisure complex to increase 
the sports facilities in the area.The  
nearest cinema at Sidcup was thought to
be too far away and youth club         
facilities insufficient.               </content>
