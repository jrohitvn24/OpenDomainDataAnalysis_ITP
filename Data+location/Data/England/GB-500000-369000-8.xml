		<title>08DALGETY SPILLERS</title>
		<content> Last week, 15th of May,we went to     
 Dalgety Spillers alias the new        
 mill.Unfortunately they were very busy
 so we could only get a little         
 information. The mill was built       
 fifty-five years ago in 1930.         
    Their main produce is              
 grain,fertlizer and chemicals which   
 they sell to different firms.In the   
 past fifty-five years the mill has    
 been changed quite frequently, it also
 has a lot more ladies working here    
 than it used to have years ago.The    
 owner of the mill is now Mr           
 Clenaham,but he has not owned the mill
 since it was built.                   
    The mill is situated on Station    
 Road and is in production six days of 
 the week.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
