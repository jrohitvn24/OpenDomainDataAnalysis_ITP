		<title>01GENERAL AREA</title>
		<content>{The area in our survey is a rural area
{made up mainly of arable farmland.}It 
 is bisected by 2 major roads,the{A1   
 and the{M62.}The only railway line    
 crossing the grid is used mainly by   
 coal trains carrying coal from local  
 pits to local power stations.         
 There are 3 main built-up areas,these 
 being part of the Warwick Estate and  
 part of Womersley Road in Knottingley 
 and most of Darrington Village west of
 the A1.Each of these is different from
 each other,the first being a large,   
 fairly modern council estate,the      
 second mainly pre-war semi-detatched  
 or terrace houses and the third mainly
 private,stone-built,detatched houses. 
 The 2 industries in our grid are      
 Plasmor concrete block manufacturers  
 and Darrington Quarries,one of a group
 of local limestone quarries.
