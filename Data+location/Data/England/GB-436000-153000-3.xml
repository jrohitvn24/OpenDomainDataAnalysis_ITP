		<title>03THE RIVER SWIFT-UPTON</title>
		<content>{The River Swift}is really a winter    
 bourne. It starts flowing about       
 January and has usually stopped by    
 June.                                 
 There are two sources for the bourne, 
 one near Hen Barn at {Upton}, and the 
 other at Cock Pit in the {Netherton   
 valley.                               
 There is a local saying "When the Cock
 and Hen shall meet, corn will be dear 
 and hay cheap".                       
 The 'Cock' and 'Hen' meet in Church   
 Street on the bend near Parsonage     
 Farm in{Hurstbourne Tarrant.}The 'Hen'
 flows down the  valley from {Upton},  
 and even in the summer you can see the
 dry river bed.                        
 The'Cock' goes underground in {       
{Netherton}valley and flows inside a   
 pipe through the village until it.    
 reaches the 'Hen' in Church Street.You
 can see the pipe where it emerges.    </content>
