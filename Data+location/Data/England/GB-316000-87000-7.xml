		<content> There were two forges in the smithy   
 until one of the chimneys was taken   
 down. The old smith's cottage used to 
 be where the garage stands. Up until  
 1930 the jobs included shoeing,       
 sharpening and general repairs.Farmers
 usually worked  at least five or six  
 horses,.and had a horse and trap to go
 to Honiton market. Other things that  
 were made included ploughs, drag      
 harrows,metal tyres, axe heads and pig
 rings.To shoe a horse would cost two  
 shillings(ten pence). Outside the     
 forge is a metal base used for holding
 a wooden wheel while a metal tyre was 
 put on.Today the forge is still in use
 but more often the farrier takes a    
 portable forge to the customers.At the
 present time there is a lady farrier  
 working at the forge.
