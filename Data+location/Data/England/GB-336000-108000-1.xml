		<title>01CRICKET ST.THOMAS-THE AREA</title>
		<content> This area is quite high reaching a    
 height of over 220m.The main A30 road 
 runs through the block following the  
 ridge of the Windwhistle Hill.To the  
 North of the main road there is mostly
 farmland with some woodland.To the    
 South of the main road is a large area
 of farmland-mostly given over to      
 pasture for dairy cattle and          
 sheep, although there is some mixed   
 woodland too.There is also the estate 
 of Cricket St.Thomas which has now    
 become a wildlife park.It consists of 
 a large country house with gardens and
 grounds covering 2 sq.kilometres.
