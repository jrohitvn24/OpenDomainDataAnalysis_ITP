		<title>13RECOLLECTIONS - HAZEL SLADE</title>
		<content>  Old residents remember the area as a 
number of separate mining communities. 
The villages remain, but the sense of  
community is fast disappearing.They    
see the decaying physical remains of   
the past and recall the good old days. 
The horse racing connection which saw  
Tom Coulthwaite train 2 Grand National 
Winners in 1911 and 1913.              
  Old miners can still see the remains 
of the pit head baths built in 1932 at 
Cannock Wood Colliery. There are ruins 
at the blacksmith's fitting and turning
shops at the Old Rawnsley Yard and the 
remains of brickyards like the old     
brickyard of Cannock and Rugeley       
Colliery. The Grange, once the home of 
Colonel R.S. Williamson the general    
manager of the Cannock and Rugeley     
Colliery is now an Old Peoples' Home.  
  In 1985 remains of the mining past   
are fast disappearing.                 </content>
