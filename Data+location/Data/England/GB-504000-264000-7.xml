		<title>07Swineshead Heritage Weekend</title>
		<content> As Swineshead is a village with a     
 wealth of historic buildings plus a   
 beauty of its own, it was decided that
 in May 1985 to hold a Heritage        
 Weekend. The aim was to use the beauty
 of the village for the church         
 restoration fund.                     
 The weekend started on the Friday     
 evening with a concert and an art     
 exhibition, held in the church.       
 Saturday and Sunday attractions       
 included: a plant sale, tractor rides,
 demonstrations of crafts, a nature    
 trail, Maypole dancing and afternoon  
 teas.                                 
 A special Swineshead cookery book of  
 villagers favourite recipes was also  
 produced and sold at the event.       
 The whole weekend proved to be an     
 enormous success showing what the     
 village can acheive.
