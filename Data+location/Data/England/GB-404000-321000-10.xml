 is let for grass and is entirely beef 
 cattle.  It is run by just the farmer 
 and his wife they do not employ any   
 extra help.  The old farm house is    
 very large, having 6 spacious rooms   
 downstairs and eight bedrooms upstairs
 and a big attic, there is also a large
 garden.   Their four sons are now     
 grown up and live away from home.

 for a week or so and some just        
 over night.  Most visitors enjoy doing
 jobs to help out, much as painting,   
 gardening or jam making.  The house is
