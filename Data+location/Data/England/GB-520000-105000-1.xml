 Our class has surveyed around the     
 Shoreham area for the project.        
 Shoreham inports things at the harbour
 like oil metal and petrol. This town  
 is mainly residential but the downs   
 are very close. The nearest big town  
 is Brighton. On our outing our class  
 was divided up into groups  and we    
 surveyed the area.                    
 We shared the area with Shoreham First
 school. They investigated the east,   
 west and north of the area and looked 
 particularly at the airport andthe    
 larger industries.We have looked at   
 the lifestyles of the inhabitants of  
 Shoreham and conducted surveys and    
 interviews.
