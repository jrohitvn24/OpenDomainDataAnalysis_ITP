		<title>19Life in the Area.</title>
		<content> All the people interviewed liked the  
{isolation, quietness}and{freedom}of   
 the area. There are very few{amenities
 and the inhabitants have to do a lot  
 of{travelling.}The nearest shops and  
 petrol station are about two and a    
 half miles away at{South Killingholme 
 and{East Halton.}The{buses}stop only  
 at Manby Road roundabout and{passenger
{trains}have not run for over 20 years.
{Letters}are delivered to the door but 
 the{papers}are collected from Mr.     
 Wilson's house on the main road. There
 are a few scattered houses surrounded 
 by{industry:}L.O.R, the C.E.G.B,      
 Texaco,Humber Sea and Land Services.  
 Surprisingly there was little smell!  
 The inhabitants make their own        
 entertainment even though there is a  
 pub nearby. However there are fears   
 that a{nuclear dump}will threaten     
 their lifestyles.                     </content>
