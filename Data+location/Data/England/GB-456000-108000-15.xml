 The noise of our approach ensured we  
 saw very little of the wildlife but we
 discovered evidence of a large and    
 varied wildlife population from       
 spoors,droppings and interviews from  
 local people.We were surprised to find
 3 small herds of deer living in the   
 copse and coming out at dusk or early 
 morning to feed on the cereals and    
 grassland.There is a large rabbit     
 population especially on Wickham      
 Common.The spoors of foxes and badgers
 were found on the footpaths along the 
 cereal fields and in the woodland. The
 homes of mice and fieldmice were      
 discovered in the cereal fields.A dead
 bat close to the tower of Knowle      
 Hospital suggests a bat colony close  
 by.Rabbit shooting and foxhunting are 
 local activities.
