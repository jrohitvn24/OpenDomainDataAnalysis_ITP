 You can have as many players as you   
 like.You sort out who will be 'on it' 
 and then he goes to the opposite side 
 of the playground.Then he turns his   
 back to the other players and they    
 have to get to the other side while   
 the person who is 'on it' has his back
 to them.The person who is 'on it' is  
 allowed to keep turning around as long
 as there is a space of about 2 seconds
 between them.If he sees anybody move  
 they have to stand in a row next to   
 him with there arms stretched out.Also
 their fingers have to be touching.The 
 people who have been caught can get   
 free if someone touches them and says 
{'Hot Chocolate'}and they all run to   
 the other end of the playground.If the
 person who is 'on it' tigs someone who
 is running to the other end,that      
 person is 'on it'.Continued on page 6.</content>
