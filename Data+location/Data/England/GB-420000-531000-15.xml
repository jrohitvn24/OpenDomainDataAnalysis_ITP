		<title>15BIOGRAPHY _LOCAL PERSONALITY</title>
		<content> Mrs Tulip is not a public figure in   
 the broadest sense, but is well known 
 &amp; respected in Newfield, where she was
 born 83yrs ago. It was in her small,  
 neat terraced home (street in slide 3)
 that she talked about her life and the
 changes she has seen within the local 
 community. This brought an interesting
 new facet to some of the younger views
 previously recorded in these pages.   
 Mrs Tulip comes of mining stock, her  
 father and husband both miners. In her
 youth several local collieries were in
 operation &amp; full employment taken for 
 granted, though some men lost their   
 jobs during the General Strike of1926.
 She paralleled the present attempts of
 the Nottingham miners to form their   
 own union, when men were sent from the
 pit at Byers Green to work at Newfield
 forcing the local men to protect their
 own jobs by similar action-it failed. </content>
