      On Saturday June 1st 1985 my new 
 baby brother was born at Ashington    
 Hospital.  He weighed 7lb 6ozs.  He   
 has long black hair, fat legs and long
 feet.  He has blue eyes and we call   
 him Daniel. We bought a pram for him, 
 it is brown. A pram is very useful,   
 the baby can be taken for walks in it.
 He has a white bath to get washed in  
 and some little towels to get dried   
 on.  My mam put talc on him to make   
 him smell nice.  He wears nappies     
 because he is not old enough to go to 
 the toilet.  When my Mam came home    
 from the hospital the Health Visitor  
 came to see her and the baby.  On     
 Tuesday June the 17th my mam took     
 Daniel to the Health Centre.  The     
 nurse weighed him and he was 8lb 7ozs.
