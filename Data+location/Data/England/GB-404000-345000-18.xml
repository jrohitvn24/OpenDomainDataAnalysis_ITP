played on a board with 64 alternate    
black and white sqwares.Each player has
16 black or white pieces consisting of 
a king,a queen,two bishops,two knights,
two castles and eight pawns.The object 
of the game is to capture as many of   
the other player's pieces as you can   
and make it impossible for the king to 
move and win the game saying "Check    
Mate."                                 
 DOMINOES.This game is played with 28  
pieces marked in two halves with       
numbers from O to 6. The highest double
e.g.6/6,starts and players try to get  
rid of all their pieces by putting a   
similar numbered half down next to a   
similar half on the table.The winner is
the first person to play all his pieces
while the others add up their remaining
numbers.The highest total gives the    
loser.                                 </content>
