		<title>10ELMBRIDGE - ENERGY</title>
		<content> Through this small rural area pass    
 three of the main sources of energy   
 used in this country today. There is a
 section of a new underground oil pipe 
 line being placed this year. It is    
 part of 120 mile stretch from         
 Southampton to Wolverhampton and      
 carries all grades of oil. There is   
 also a 24 inch underground gas main   
 and a number of large electricity     
 pylons which supply part of the       
 national grid. Householders use oil,  
 electricity and propane gas for       
 central heating in their homes as     
 there is no natural gas available     
 locally. Many also have open fires and
 wood burning stoves to heat the house,
 also used are Aga cookers and Rayburn 
 stoves which provide heat as well as  
 cooking. Most other houses cook with  
 electricity but a few use propane gas.
