		<title>20BEACH AMENITIES INTERVIEW</title>
		<content>Tourist in a coastal area:             
The tourist was interviewed at         
Cullercoats amusements.She had arrived 
here by car,and she came from          
Tynemouth.She said Cullercoats was a   
good area for tourists because of the  
hot weather and discos.The tourists    
should have a proper place to meet.She 
had visited the area before and enjoyed
the nightlife and castle.On the beach  
she swims and walks.She used all the   
facilities except the swimming pool.   
Resident Of North East Area(not coast):
He arrived by car and thought the      
arcades,pools and golf were good for   
visitors.The hotels could be improved. 
The problems are the place is too      
crowded.He came to go to the Park      
Hotel.On the beach he sunbathed,swam   
and played football,using the sandy    
part all the time.When he comes he only
uses the Park Hotel and the beach.     </content>
