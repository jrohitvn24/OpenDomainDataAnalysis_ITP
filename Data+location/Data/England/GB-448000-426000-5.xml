		<content>    BURTON COMMON FARM                 
                                       
   Burton Common Farm is owned by Mr   
 Atkinson. It covers 540 acres of land.
 The main crops are wheat, barley,     
 rape and potatoes, but peas,          
 strawberries and raspberries are also 
 grown. The only animals he keeps are  
 pigs,of which he has 2,000. Mr        
 Atkinson has 13 tractors, 9 trailers, 
 12 cultivators and 5 potato sowers.   
 The main problem is the soil, which is
 very poor. It needs a lot of          
 irrigation and fertiliser. In fact,   
 2,000 tons of fertiliser is used each 
 year.
