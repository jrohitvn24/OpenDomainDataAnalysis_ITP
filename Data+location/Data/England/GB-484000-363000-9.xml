     The Trust was established in 1703 
 by the then vicar, Rev.Disney. On his 
 death a committee of seven was set up 
 to administer the Trust which has an  
 annual income now of about one        
 thousand pounds.The old school house, 
 other property and gifts of money have
 been left to the Trust over the years.
 The property was sold off and the     
 money invested. The Trust can help    
 people and village organisations who  
 fall on hard times but are not allowed
 to give any help to either the church 
 or the chapel. Up to ten years ago    
 working men who were in difficulty    
 received a half a ton of coal at      
 Christmas while widows received one   
 ton of coal. When a death occurs in a 
 family the Trust gives them one       
 hundred pounds at Christmas.
