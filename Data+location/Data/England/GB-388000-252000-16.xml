		<content>{PARISH AND COMMUNITY LIFE             
  As there are several churches in     
 a small area of population, it is     
 likely that one of the old Anglican   
 parish churches may have to be closed 
 as a centre of worship.{Churchill}was 
 earlier designated for closure but was
 kept alive as  a community , by       
 the action of one lady parishioner. It
 cannot now be used for weddings etc.  
 but still has a  loyal                
 congregation.                         
{ All Saints at Spetchley}is now       
 being considered by the{Church        
{Commissioners}for discontinued use as 
 a place of worship .                  
{ Bredicot church }has a congregation  
 from outside the parish to swell its  
 numbers.It boasts no electric light,  
 as yet, which is the reason  why the  
 five services a year are in summer at 
 3pm.                                  </content>
