		<title>04Parkwood Junior School.</title>
		<content> Our school was opened in 1967.        
 It is on the South Western edge of    
 Scunthorpe.                           
 The infant and junior schools are     
 joined together by the kitchen.       
 There are climbing frames in the      
 playgrounds on the grassy areas. The  
 greenhouse is next to the 4th. year   
 playground. We have 3 playgrounds. In 
 each playground we have seats and     
 bins.                                 
 Wire fences are all around the        
 perimeter of the school.              
 There are two fields. The larger one  
 is for games and sports and is shared 
 with the infants.                     
 We can use the other at playtimes when
 it's dry.                             
 We have 10 classes at the moment.     
 (A few years ago there were 13.)      
 Next year there will only be 9        
 classes.                              </content>
