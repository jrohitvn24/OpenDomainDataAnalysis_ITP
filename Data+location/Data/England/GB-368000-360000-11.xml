		<title>11Public Houses</title>
		<content> There are 3 public houses or pubs in  
 the area.The smallest is the{Verdin   
{Arms}which is in Minshull Vernon.The  
{Bear's Paw }and the {Grange }are in   
 Warmingham.The 2 former are typical co
 untry pubs selling drinks and food.The
 Grange is the most interesting of them
 as it reflects the modern trend of nos
 talgia.It was the Rectory until the   
 1960's when it was sold being too larg
 e and expensive to run as the living  
 no longer provides the income it did  
 owing to modern farming methods which 
 have led to the decline of the rural  
 population.)The old stables have been 
 converted into a pub,the {Bull and Bus
{h}and an extension has been added to  
 provide the setting for the{Medieval  
{Banquets}which are held every Saturday
 night in Winter.The food and drinks ar
 e old English and cutlery is kept to  
 the minimum.There is room for 200.    </content>
