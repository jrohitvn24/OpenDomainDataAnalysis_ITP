		<content>    The{main crops grown}in the South  
 Fen area of Twenty and Tongue End are 
{winter wheat, sugar beet and potatoes.
 Also to be seen growing on the flat,  
 rich, black fenland soil is{celery.}  
    Several farmers are re-planting    
{trees for conservation}purposes to    
 replace the many elms that were once  
 so common before they fell to Dutch   
 elm disease.  Until recently there    
 were between two and three hundred old
 fen willows but even these have       
 gradually died away.  Farmers have    
 pulled also pulled up trees and       
{filled in dykes}to make{fields larger.
 Indeed,few farm yards have many trees.
    Much of the regular{weeding and }  
{hoeing}is undertaken{(by hand)}by the 
 local people who may be seen working  
 in the fields on most days.
