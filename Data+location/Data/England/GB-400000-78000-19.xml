		<title>19FOOTBALL TEAM SWANAGE</title>
		<content>   We played Bovington in the finals,  
 the home team!!!. It was very exciting
 game and we were all thrilled to be   
 playing in the final. Bovington held  
 up well but they were not good enough 
 and we beat them 2-0. We were very    
 excited at winning the final game.    
 This meant we had won the competition.
 We had our picture taken for the local
 newspaper and were all very happy.    
   This was the first time our school  
 had entered the six-a-side football   
 competition since 1974 when Saint     
 Mary's became a First School. You can 
 imagine how wonderful we felt at our  
 success. Our school gave us a really  
 lovely party to celebrate our win. The
 team photograph is now on the wall of 
 our classroom. All the team had a copy
 of the photograph to take home on the 
 day we were presented with our medals.
