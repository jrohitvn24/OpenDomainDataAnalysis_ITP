		<title>12HOUSES OF LIPHOOK</title>
		<content>      Most of the houses in Liphook are
 Post War.Many of the ones that are    
 pre-war have been rebuilt in places   
 and modernized.Older houses are being 
 pulled down to make way for newer and 
 stronger houses or in many cases,     
 flats and office blocks.Liphook is    
 expanding as more and more houses and 
 offices are being built and has       
 changed dramatically since world war  
 II.                                   
      At the Centre of Liphook some of 
 the houses are above the shops that   
 are there.The ones above the shops    
 were built just after the war. There  
 are a few modern council estates in   
 the centre of the town as well as     
 older houses.                         
      There are many hotels in Liphook.
 There are also many pubs.  On the     
 older houses the doors and windows are
 wooden and old fashioned.             </content>
