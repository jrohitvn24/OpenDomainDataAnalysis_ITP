		<title>11Strawberry picking at Gatton</title>
		<content>    The people who go stawberry picking
 at Whitehall Fruit Farm buy a basket  
 or bring their own. If you buy a      
 basket it will cost 8p for a small    
 one, 12p for a middle sized one or 15p
 for a large one. The farmer says not  
 to eat the strawberries as you are    
 picking them, but people still do,    
 without anyone noticing. When they    
 have enough they go to the lady       
 sitting under the umbrella, she will  
 weigh them and take the money like a  
 shop keeper does. She uses            
{electronic scales}to make sure how    
 many there are and to calculate the   
 right price. The stawberries cost{58p 
{a pound}and most people think its fun 
 picking them.                         
    Not all the fruit grown at the farm
 is sold in this way, a lot of it is   
 picked by workers and sent off to     
{market.                               </content>
