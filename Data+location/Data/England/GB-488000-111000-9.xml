		<title>09Levin Down Nature Reserve</title>
		<content> The south facing slope of Levin Down  
 was established as a nature reserve in
 1981. The reserve in managed by the   
 Sussex Trust for Nature Conservation, 
 by agreement with the landowner , the 
 Goodwood Estate Co.                   
 Covering twenty acres, the reserve is 
 a fine example of chalk downland which
 has not been cultivated for many      
 centuries; a type of land not very    
 common these days. Rich in plant life,
 surveys have revealed more than 180   
 different species. The reserve is also
 an important habitat for butterflies  
 and birds. The site also supports a   
 large colony of juniper, a shrub fast 
 disappearing in the south of England. 
 Many varieties of the orchid family   
 grow here including early purple,     
 common spotted, fragrant, bee, frog &amp; 
 autumn ladies tresses. Autumn gentian 
 &amp; rampion also grow here in profusion.</content>
