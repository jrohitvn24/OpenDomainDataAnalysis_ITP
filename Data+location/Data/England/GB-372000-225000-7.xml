		<content>  The{Newent Centre}is situated on the 
 outskirts of Newent at the junction of
 Ross Road and High Street and is      
 housed in buildings that were once a  
 workhouse for the poor and more       
 recently Newent Grammar School.       
                                       
  Today the buildings are used for     
 adult education, as a youth club and  
 as a meeting place for some of the    
 approximately 50 clubs and societies  
 that flourish in Newent today.        
                                       
  Recently the{Town Council}has had to 
 vacate its rooms in the Forest of Dean
 District Council Offices in the High  
 Street and is now housed in the       
 Centre. Here members of the public can
 view local planning applications and  
 can voice an opinion through their    
 elected representatives about the     
 quality of life in Newent.            </content>
