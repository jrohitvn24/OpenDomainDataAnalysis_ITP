		<content>  In 1985 the most popular hairstyle   
for girls is the 'bob' look and for    
boys it is anything very short.  The   
'bob' hairstyle is done in many        
variations and colours but the basic   
look is flattened hair down the back of
the neck with a diagonal slope of hair 
up the forehead.  This style dates back
to Egyptian times and like many other  
styles, comes into fashion every few   
years.  The fashion world goes up like 
a spiral and effectively to go one step
forward you take two steps back.  Even 
though people claim things to be new   
fashions you are to find it somewhere  
else in fashions long history.  Now if 
you wanted your hair coloured, you     
would either have the dye sprayed,     
fingered or combed in.
