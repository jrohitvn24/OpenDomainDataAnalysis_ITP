{newspaper}but later went on to join   
 the Tweeddale press_group.The paper is
 sold in newsagents all over the area

 have appeared in the paper recently   
 are the fire at Ponteland Middle      
 School and the explosion at the       
 Cantonese Restaurant in Darras Hall.To
 get their stories, the staff of the   
 Ponteland Observer ring up the{Fire

 also keep in touch with all the major 
 organisations in Ponteland and ask    
 them to send reports of their meetings
 etc.Altogether,the Ponteland Observer 
 helps to create a community atmosphere
 in the village of Ponteland.
