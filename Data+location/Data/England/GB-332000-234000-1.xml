		<title>01GENERAL INFORMATION</title>
		<content> The study area is situated in a very  
 rural landscape in an area known as   
 the Golden Valley.                    
 The main occupation in the area is    
 agriculture, although more people are 
 moving into the area to live. The     
 settlements of Michaelchurch and      
 Turnastone are very dispersed and new 
 housing is not common. Old housing    
 sells at a premium attracting         
 commuters into the area. The area has 
 no major historical,industrial or     
 social significance. However, it is an
 area of this country that many people 
 who have experienced its beauty find  
 difficult to leave.
