		<content> INDUSTRY IN WALKDEN                   
 In Walkden there are two types of     
 main industry in our history.We had   
 the mills and the collieries.The mills
 were built around 1860 by the men of  
 the Walkden and Little Hulton region. 
 The mills had names like Park Mill,   
 Boat Shed Mill and Primrose Mill.     
 Reservoirs were built near the mills  
 so that they had plenty of water to   
 run the machines.The mills were used  
 for making cotton.However,during a    
 recession,mills closed.Now the old    
 mills have been made into warehouses. 
 Walkden also had a colliery.The seam  
 became known as the Walkden 4 foot    
 wide.In between the layers of coal    
 were layers of shale,sandstone        
 and other minerals.The seam ran to    
 Walkden Town Hall.It was owned by the 
 Nightingale family.There was a mine   
 where Mesne Lea Primary School now is.</content>
