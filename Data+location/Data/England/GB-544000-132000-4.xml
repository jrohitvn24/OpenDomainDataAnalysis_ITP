		<content>   On the Northern edge of Ashdown     
 Forest, small groups of houses grew up
 near the gates - Coleman's Hatch,     
 Chuck Hatch, forester's and keeper's  
 lodges and charcoal burner's huts.  On
 lower and more fertile ground several 
 large farms were established,         
 particularly around Marsh Green where 
 Newbridge Mill Forge was built.       
   Ironmasters'houses,in the 17th      
 Century, were farms as well and after 
 the iron industry ceased little new   
 building took place before the late   
 19th century, when smaller housing    
 for farm workers and artisans was     
 built, mainly along the B2110 road.   
   In 1910 much land was sold by the   
 Buckhurst Estate and areas around     
 Cotchford and Parrock Lane were       
 developed with large houses. Between  
 the wars some 'ribbon' development    
 took place along the B2110.           </content>
