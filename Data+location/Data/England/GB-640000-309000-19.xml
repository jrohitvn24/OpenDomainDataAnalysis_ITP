 STOKESBY IS A SMALLISH VILLAGE AT THE 
 EASTERN END OF THE D-BLOCK.IT LIES BY 
 THE SIDE OF THE RIVER BURE ON THE     
 APPROACHES TO YARMOUTH,AND IS A       
 POPULAR MOORING PLACE FOR HOLIDAY     
 MAKERS ON THE BROADS.IN SUCH MOORINGS 
 THROUGHOUT BROADLAND,IT IS NOT UNUSUAL
 FOR A LOCAL PENSIONER TO APPOINT      
 HIMSELF "HARBOUR MASTER",ACCEPTING    
 LINES AND MAKING THEM FAST IN RETURN  
 FOR A FEW COPPERS.HOLIDAY MAKERS      
 PULLING INTO STOKESBY AS DUSK         
 APPROACHES HAVE THEREFORE NOT BEEN    
 SURPRISED TO HEAR A WEATHER-BEATEN    
 ELDERLY MAN IN SEA-JERSEY AND BATTERED
 YACHTING CAP HAILING THEM FROM THE    
 STAITHE.THEY ARE USUALLY MORE AMAZED  
 TO FIND THAT THIS WELL-KNOWN LOCAL    
 FIGURE PASSED AWAY SOME 60 YEARS AGO! 
 THIS IS TAKEN BY LOCALS TO BE THE     
 ULTIMATE IN DEVOTION TO DUTY!         </content>
