		<content>    The school was built in 1896 by the
 Harrogate School Board and later      
 became the County Primary School      
 replacing the Free Church School.     
 There were 394 pupils present when the
 new school opened on August 31st 1897.
    The building is of stone, three    
 stories high with staircases at each  
 corner, and attics in the turret rooms
 above each staircase. Each floor has a
 central hall with six classrooms off. 
    There is a large playground with a 
 shelter for bad weather. The old      
 Headteacher's House is now used as a  
 Nursery and the Caretaker's as a Youth
 Club
