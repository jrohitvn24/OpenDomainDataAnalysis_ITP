		<title>01THE SLABS AND CAUSEWAY</title>
		<content> The{Slabs}and{Causeway}are public     
 paths between Barrow and Quorn. Both  
 are next to the{River Soar}because of 
 this they are high off the ground. The
 slabs are so called because the path  
 is made of concrete slabs. The ground 
 around the slabs is rough grazing, so 
 the{County Council}rent it out to     
 farmers. Most of the trees growing    
 around the path are horse chestnut and
 oak. The path used to follow the river
 but workmen who needed to go to Quorn 
 every day built a path across the     
 field which was then called{Scotch    
{Green.}The causeway starts at the     
 river bridge and ends at the Lodge.   
 The{Causeway}is made of pebble dash   
 concrete, tarmac and ironwork.
