		<content> When we got in Portishead Mr Lang let 
 us do our{project.}He let us wander   
 about for half an hour.In that half an
 hour we knocked on this old man's and 
 lady's door.They were very nice.The   
 old lady asked us if we wanted to come
 in.So we said yes. We went on in and  
 they had two dogs. Then the old man   
 took us in to his workshop.He said his
 hobby is to make train stations. He   
 had one there which had two lights on 
 which worked.Then the old lady        
 said"Here are some sweets to share    
 between you all".They called their    
 house  "The Buoy".
