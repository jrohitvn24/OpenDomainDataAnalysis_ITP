		<title>04GHOSTHUNTING IN CHESTER</title>
		<content>  This is a new attraction and is      
 becoming increasingly popular.It is   
 organised by the {Chester Vistor      
{Centre}three times a week,when a guide
 takes a small group,of people on a two
 hour trip to see regular  "hauntings".
  These include ones at the  Malbrough 
 Arms where the landlord slit his      
 throat over a barrel of beer,and where
 the{ghostly gargles}are regulary heard
 .Another is at Bewlay's pipe shop     
 which is home for "Sarah", a          
 poltergeist who continually disrupts  
 the stocks. The group continues along 
 to the canal where a mutilated man    
 floats across the tow path! Talks and 
 discussions follow when questions are 
 asked such as "What time does the lost
 cavalier haunt the castle walls?"!
