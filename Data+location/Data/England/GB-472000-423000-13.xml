 Come to Goole, come to Goole          
 A friendly place to be,               
 All the fun and pleasure              
 Makes life here happier for me.       
                                       
                                       
 In Goole there are pubs and parks too,
 I like Goole - don't you ?            
 Goole has a new market,               
 Fine as can be .....                  
 The new Leisure Centre's in Goole     
 And there are well built schools,     
 With soon a fine new swimming pool.   
 Yes Goole has enough for me.          
                                       
 Not too big, not too small,           
 No-one can hate Goole at all.
