		<title>13Brackley estate agent</title>
		<content>   We interviewed a local estate agent 
about her job. She must work very hard 
because she has long hours (Mon-Fri    
9.00-4.00,Sat 9.00-5.00, Sun 11.00-    
4.00). She likes the job very much -   
especially meeting lots of people and  
matching houses to people.             
   Estate agents do house valuations   
and write about them so that they can  
sell them to other people. When writing
a description they need to include age,
construction, location, number of      
rooms, gardens and outbuildings. The   
price of a house depends on these but  
also on whether the type of house is   
popular. Stone cottages in pretty      
villages are very "sought after" so    
they cost more than ordinary houses    
in towns.                              
   The most popular time of year to    
move is spring. People like to settle  
in before a new school year begins.    </content>
