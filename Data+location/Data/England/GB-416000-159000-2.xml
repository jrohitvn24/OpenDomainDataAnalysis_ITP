		<content>      Buckleaze Farm is situated near  
 the River Avon and has a lot of wet   
 land.  The animals are dairy cattle,  
 beef cows, horses and peacocks.       
      There are two horses, 4 beef     
 heifers, 12 steers and 57 milking     
 cows.  The farm has no bull and so    
 uses artificial insemination for      
 breeding.                             
      The 150 acres is split up: 13    
 acres of kale, 8 acres of wheat,25    
 acres of potatoes, seven acres of hay 
 and the other 97 acres is grassland or
 marsh.                                
      The wheat is specially grown for 
 thatching straw.  It will be cut with 
 a binder, stooked and then thrashed.  
      The potatoes are for the chipping
 business and the farm has ponds of    
 crayfish which will be sold to        
 restaurants.                          
                                       </content>
