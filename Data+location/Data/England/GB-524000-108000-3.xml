 world.On the farm Mr Gorringe has two 
 combine harvesters which cost about   
 Â£50,000.He has several tractors that  
 have attachments such as ploughs and  
 cultivating machines. He does not go  
 to markets to buy bullocks,instead he 
 buys week old calves and keeps them   
 for about four years. Five men work   
 on the farm.One is a Mechanic and     
 another is an Accountant.The other    
 three work on the land.He has no sheep
 but his son keeps sheep on a farm     
 near Eastbourne. In the winter the    
 sheep are brought from Eastbourne to  
 Golf Farm to avoid the wet on the     
 marshland.                            </content>
