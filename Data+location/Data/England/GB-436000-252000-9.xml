 In 1965 Mr. Fermor came to Northend as
 a vicar.He came to Northend because he
 thought it was very important to have 
 a vicar in a village.Each Sunday      
 around 30 people go to church.        
  As well as his regular Sunday        
 services,a vicar's job is to marry    
 people,perform funeral services and   
 christening services.                 
  The vicars job is also to look after 
 the spiritual welfare of the village  
 which includes visiting people sick   
 and the elderly.He also visits people 
 when someone of their family have     
 died.                                 
  Altogether Mr. Fermor is the vicar   
 for 5 different churches.
