		<content> Widmerpool Hall is used as the Nation-
 al Training Centre for the Automobile 
 Association (AA). The AA bought the   
 hall and 8 hectares of wooded parkland
 in 1950 to use as a Patrol Service    
 Training Establishment. In 1973, after
 construction of new buildings, a tech-
 nical workshop and extended catering  
 services, it became the National Train
 -ing Centre for all staff training.   
 Building in the grounds has continued 
 and in 1985 there were 108 single     
 study bedrooms, enlarged technical    
 workshops, lecture rooms, recreational
 facilities and the Crombie Memorial   
 Club. Students attend the Training    
 Centre from all parts of the UK and   
 Eire. There are 75 permanent staff and
 two live on the premises; the rest    
 mainly live in the S. Notts. area. The
 hall has been refurbished and equipped
 to modern standards.                  </content>
