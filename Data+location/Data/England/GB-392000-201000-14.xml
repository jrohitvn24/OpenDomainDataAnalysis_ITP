		<title>14  POPULATION</title>
		<content>   In 1982 we took a census of those   
 within the village of Sapperton and we
 think very little has changed now.    
 There were 5 pre school children, 27  
 Scholars (some at the Village School  
 and some at the Cirencester           
 Comprehensive School, called 'Deer    
 Park'), 76 workers and 40 OAPs making 
 148 persons in all. Our population has
 dropped a lot since the census of     
 1851, when we had 56 pre school       
 children, 84 Scholars all at the      
 Village School, 224 workers and 15    
 retired persons, who included 6       
 paupers making 379 people living in   
 Sapperton then.
