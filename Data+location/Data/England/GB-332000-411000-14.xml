		<title>14A KEEP FIT FANATIC</title>
		<content>  Nowadays fitness freaks and in       
 particular, joggers, are not seen as  
 the 'loonies' they were once labelled 
 as. Why? Because more and more people 
 take to the streets to jog every day. 
  Mike Stanard is a jogger but takes   
 his training a little more seriously  
 as he does 5 miles daily and at       
 weekends runs marathons.  But why does
 he do it? Purely for the satisfaction 
 of winning.                           
  That isn't the goal of the average   
 everday jogger but there is usually   
 some purpose involved in jogging,     
 whether it is to lose weight, to      
 become fitter or just to keep up with 
 friends. Mike feels that everyone     
 would benefit from spending at least  
 some time each day taking exercise of 
 some kind even if they don't intend to
 run in a marathon.
