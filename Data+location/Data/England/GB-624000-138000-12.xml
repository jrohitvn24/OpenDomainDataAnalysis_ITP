		<title>12DOVER/FOLKESTONE RAIL LINE</title>
		<content>   On 17th July we walked part of the  
 Dover to Folkestone railway line,which
 was described as the "eighth wonder of
 the World" when it was constructed in 
 the 1840's.The engineers first        
 constructed the then largest brick    
 built viaduct in Folkestone,then had  
 to blow up part of the cliffs which   
 were too unsafe to tunnel through and 
 had to shore up the line throughout   
 its length ,as it runs over a landslip
 area.                                 
  In this region the chalk sits on     
 blue gault clay which is gradually    
 being compressed,causing the railway  
 to subside.A 24 hour watch has to be  
 kept on the track and British Rail    
 have now constructed aprons and sea   
 walls to stop further collapse.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
