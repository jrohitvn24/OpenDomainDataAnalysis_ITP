		<title>15Community Attitudes</title>
		<content> There is a{strong sense of community  
 in Denby but unless you are a second  
 or third generation Denby-born, you   
 are still regarded as a{"comer-in"}by 
 the locals.                           
 Since the building of the new houses  
 in the village, the old villagers     
 cannot be quite as insular as they    
 were but the old attitude still       
 remains.                              
{Most people}work and shop outside the 
 village as they have cars and travel  
 to the town for their jobs and shops. 
 The old people with no transport still
 shop at the village shop/PO which     
 serves also as the place to meet and  
 gossip to their friends.              
 The only{work}available in the area is
 generally on the farms and this quite 
 often is seasonal with{hay-making,    
{potato picking etc.                   
                                       </content>
