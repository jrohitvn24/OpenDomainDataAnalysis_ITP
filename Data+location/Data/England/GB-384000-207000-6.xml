		<title>06Interviews in Painswick</title>
		<content> From interviews with a small sample of
 people in the streets of Painswick ,it
 was clear that it is a pleasant place 
 to live.All spoke of the peacefull ,  
 quiet and friendly nature of the      
 village.While it offers several       
 ammenities ,it is not too big and the 
 old stone houses with pretty gardens  
 are very attractive.It has several    
 times won the Bledisloe Cup for the   
 best kept large village.              
  The only complaint among residents   
 seem to be about the roads.They feel  
 there are not enough buses and there  
 is too much heavy traffic through the 
 centre ,in view of the narrow roads. A
 controversey at the moment is about a 
 proposed three storey building        
 development ,which some people feel   
 would not be in keeping with the      
 nature of the village.
