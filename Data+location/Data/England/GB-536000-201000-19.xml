		<title>19Knolleys Nursery, Cheshunt</title>
		<content>The nursery we visited was called      
Knolleys.The nursery first opened in   
the 1920's.The people in the nursery   
grow flowers.They grow one quarter of  
a million flowers a year.They sell most
of them at Covent Garden.They do not   
grow any tomatoes because they are     
difficult to grow in the nursery.They  
heat the glass houses by using oil.It  
costs 10,000 pounds to heat the glass  
houses every year.                     
The people in the nursery stopped the  
glass blowing out by painting all of   
the windows in the nursery.Many glass  
houses have gone out of business       
because the cost of running them is far
too high for the people to pay.        
As a result, the land was sold, the    
glasshouses knocked down, and housing  
estates built.
