		<title>10 - HOUSING (2)</title>
		<content> There is some council housing, but    
 they tend to be occupied by older or  
 retired people. Young couples have to 
 join a long waiting list for a council
 house, and usually have to leave the  
 area.                                 
 The private girls' school at          
 St. Michael's, Burton Park, has built 
 houses for its own staff. An old      
 stable block was converted into sixth 
 form study bedrooms.                  
 This area is administered by West     
 Sussex County Council and Chichester  
 District Council. Duncton has a parish
 council, with seven councillors.      
                                       
 The three shops in the area consist of
 a builders merchant at Heathend       
 Sandpit, a motor accessory and sweet  
 shop at Heathend garage and the       
 Granary (china and furniture) at      
 Coultershaw.                          </content>
