		<title>04The Lock at Marlow</title>
		<content> The original lock was built in{Marlow 
 in 1777 where the footbridge is now.  
 In 1812 the lock was improved and made
 with concrete. The new lock can hold  
 685 000 litres (4.5 metres deep) when 
 low. It can hold 1 370 000 litres (9  
 metres deep) when full. A boat would  
 normally have to wait one to one and a
 half hours to go through the lock on a
 really busy day. On average one person
 falls in every week. Most of them try 
 to jump the 1.5 metres with only half 
 a metre of rope!                      
   When we asked the lockkeeper about  
 the old mill that used to be there he 
 said that it was disused in 1945 and  
 pulled down in 1968. He doesn't like  
 the new houses that have been built   
 there.                                
 He well remembers the day in 1977 when
 as part of her Jubilee Celebrations   
{the Queen came through the lock.      </content>
