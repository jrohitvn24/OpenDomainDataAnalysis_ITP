		<title>08The Environment</title>
		<content>  As part of our work for the Domesday 
 project children from our school made 
 visits into various parts of our area 
 to survey the environment.On one trip 
 we went to Brownwich Lane (locally    
 pronounced Brunnidge) and attempted to
 walk a footpath which was quite       
 clearly marked on the map. However,   
 the path was very evidently overgrown 
 with stinging nettles and we could not
 make our way through. We spoke to a   
 lady about the path but she was quite 
 unsure about where it came out. She   
 gave us some different directions from
 the map. We felt that the path should 
 have been cleared by the local council
 and decided to write to them to say   
 so. But over a month later we have    
 received no reply. We think it is     
 important that these footpaths should 
 be kept open.
