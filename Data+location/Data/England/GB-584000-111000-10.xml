		<content> Guestling-Bradshaw Primary School has 
 206 pupils on roll approximately.     
                                       
 At ll years the children transfer to  
 either Hillcrest Comprehensive School 
 in Hastings or Thomas Peacocke        
 Comprehensive School in Rye, E. Sussex
                                       
 Hillcrest has ll60 pupils on roll.    
 The day starts at 8.55am and ends at  
 4pm. The school takes children from ll
 to l8 years of age, both boys and     
 girls.                                
                                       
 Many of the children have to travel to
 school by bus as they live so far     
 away.  Parents of children at the     
 primary school often take them by car.
 Both schools have active              
 Parent-Teacher Associations to support
 the schools by raising funds.
