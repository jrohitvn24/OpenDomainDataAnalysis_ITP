		<content>    LANGTOFT STORE                     
 Since I have been living in Langtoft  
 there has been three owners in three  
 years.I think that because there has  
 been three owners profit may not have 
 been very good.The shop sells         
 food,cigarettes,sweets,alchohol,soft  
 drinks and dog and cat food.David the 
 man there at the moment seems to be   
 sticking to it and is probably is     
 making a profit.The shop opens at     
 0800 and closes at 2000 every day of  
 the week except Wednesday which opens 
 at the normal time but closes at 1400 
 and Sundays 1000 and closes at 1400 so
 it is very conveneant for every       
 body.David rents the shop off         
 Mrs.Flatters.the shop is a general    
 store and sells Soada_Streams and most
 other things.But David also sells     
 groceries more than any thing and the 
 busiest days of the week are Friday   </content>
