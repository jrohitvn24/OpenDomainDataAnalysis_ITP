		<title>06RAILWAY LINE NR. WOMERSLEY.</title>
		<content> The railway line runs North-South     
 through the area, passing close to    
 Womersley,which has two level         
 crossings and one small signal box.   
 The signal master as been working on  
 the railway for eight years. He       
 doesn't have to travel far from his   
 home to get to work as he lives near  
 by. No other members of his famiy are 
 employed in the train industry. To    
 become a train master you don't need  
 lots of qualifications, you are       
 trained on how to switch lines and    
 that is all.                          
 There are a variety of cargoes that   
 pass through, but most are carrying   
 stone or coal. On average, nine       
 passenger trains pass per week.       
 The trains are not allowed to stop to 
 load or unload their cargoes because  
 there is no station.
