		<title>17COMMUNITY POLICEMEN</title>
		<content> This term, Colin called every Tuesday 
 to give us lessons about the police   
 and their jobs.  One week we all      
 entered a competition drawing a       
 picture on not to drop litter. Another
 week we had a debate on whether a     
 person should be killed for killing   
 someone else.  He brought a Range     
 Rover to our school and we could sit  
 in it if we wanted to.  Its           
 registration number was RPP 284W;  it 
 had 20 lights and cost Â£12000.  A week
 or two after we made a visit to Welwyn
 Garden City Police Station in the     
 police van and were locked in the     
 cells.
