		<content>{WILTON PARK BATLEY}-LOCAL VIEWS       
{THE QUESTIONS:}1) Do you live locally?
 2) What do you like about the park? 3)
 Have you any complaints? 4)Do you like
 the museum?  5)  Has the park altered?
{1st  couple:} middle  aged  and  lived
 locally,  about 8 miles away. This was
 their  first  visit and they said that
 they  would  come back.  They liked it
 because it was a nice place.          
{2nd couple: }They  were OAP's (65-70).
 They were locals and had walked to the
 park.  They thought it catered for all
 needs  but thought it a shame that the
 lake had been  polluted  with rubbish.
{3rd couple:} They were middle aged and
 they  had  walked to  the  park.  They
 thought  it  was  a  good  place for a
 picnic.  They  thought that there  was
 something  good  for the  children  to
 play on (swings,  climbing frame and a
 paddling pool).                       </content>
