		<title>02THE LERRYN RIVER</title>
		<content>       The beauty of the{Lerryn river  
  attracts people for various reasons. 
 Many to "mess about in boats," others 
 to watch birds and wildlife and some  
 to just relax and enjoy it's beauty.  
       The Lerryn river has it's source
 in the{Boconnoc Estate}and is tidal as
 far as{Lerryn Bridge. }The river flows
 into a lake on the Estate and some of 
 the water is diverted into a leat that
 used to power the{old mill}at{Couch's 
{Mill.}Water is also diverted into an  
 old leat that fed a mill at Lerryn.   
      The river inspires some people to
 try and capture it's beauty on paper  
 and canvas. It is said that{Kenneth   
{Grahame}wrote{"The Wind in the        
{Willows"}after a river trip to Lerryn 
 from Fowey.
