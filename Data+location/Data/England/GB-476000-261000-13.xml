		<title>13 ST.JOHN'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>St John's was founded about the year   
1140 originally as a hospital, although
a small chapel has always been there.  
It is one of the oldest churches in    
Northampton. St. John's is situated at 
the bottom of Bridge Street at the     
southern end of the town. It is a very 
good example of golden ironstone being 
 remodelled in the fourteenth and      
fifteenth centuries. St. Johns was a   
hospital in medieval times. It then    
became an alms-house. In 1880 it was   
sold to the Catholics who made the     
house into a church and altered it for 
worship. St.Johns is the only remaining
medieval part of the hospital of St.   
Johns. As a hospital it consisted of   
two storeys. Monks lived on the second 
floor in their cells.
