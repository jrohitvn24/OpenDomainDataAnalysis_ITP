		<content> This is essentially a mixture of New  
 Town and villages set in arable       
 landscape diagonally bisected by a    
 chalk_fed stream, used as a boundary  
 between the New Town and the Green    
 Belt.  The valley is designated as a  
 beauty area in which development is   
 prohibited.  The limiting of the      
 growth of the villages to their       
 existing boundaries and the ease of   
 access to the main line railway to    
 Central London for commuters makes    
 this area expensive to live in.       
 Industry, by design, is grouped in an 
 area close to the railway.  It        
 consists of high technology firms,    
 based on research and clean products. 
 Leisure facilities are grouped along  
 the river to reinforce the distinction
 between the New Town and the Green    
 Belt.
