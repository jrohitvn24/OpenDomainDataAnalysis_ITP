		<content> Gala Day (cont'd):                    
      In the top class of Four Marks   
 School the girls are asked to         
 volunteer if they would like to be a  
 Gala Princess.  This year the Gala    
 Princesses were Karen Ullman and Kelly
 Jones.  The Gala Queen is judged from 
 older girls in the village at a disco 
 in the Village Hall.  Karen Bailey was
 chosen this year.                     
      Now I shall describe my Gala Day 
 in 1985.  It was pouring with rain    
 when I woke up.  I am a Guide and we  
 put in a float every year.  When I    
 went to decorate the float at 9 a.m.  
 it had stopped raining for a while. We
 had to go back at 11.30 to change into
 our costumes for the float which was  
 "Guides through the Ages". I was a    
 guide from 1930.  We ate our lunch on 
 the float whilst waiting to be judged.
  We didn't win a cup this year.       </content>
