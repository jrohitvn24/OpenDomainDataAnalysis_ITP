		<content> This edge of the{East Beds. market    
{garden area}presents a neat and tidy  
 appearance. Fairly large areas of     
 barley, wheat, rape, potatoes, sugar  
 beet and sprouts are grown. Field     
 grown market garden crops include     
 lettuce, cabbage, marrows, courgettes,
 onions, radish, broad and green beans,
 spinach and parsley. Small areas are  
 used for the growing of rose trees.   
 Hedgerows are mechanically trimmed.   
 Many farmers burn most of the straw,  
 an act which is not always popular.   
 There are several farm reservoirs used
 in irrigation. The traditionally large
 labour force is being replaced by more
 machinery, larger tractors and the use
 of precision drilling, crop spraying  
 and mechanical harvesting.            
 Farm livestock consists mainly of calf
 rearing. The few meadows are usually  
 grazed by riding ponies.              </content>
