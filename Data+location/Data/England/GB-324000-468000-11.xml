		<content> A pipeline to transport gas from the  
 gasfield under Morecambe Bay to the   
 National Gas Grid near Kendal (to the 
 east) crosses part of the study area. 
 The pipeline comes ashore at the      
 Rampside Gas Terminal about one mile  
 to the south-west of the study area   
 and passes to the west of the villages
 of Leece and Dendron.                 
 The pipeline cannot be seen as it has 
 been buried underground.Tracing its   
 route is getting difficult as fields  
 are used again for grazing and as     
 walls and fences are rebuilt and start
 to weather.Re-surfacing of sections of
 the lanes and small gas signs by the  
 roadside will be the only reminder    
 that the pipeline is there.However    
 local people are not supplied with    
 natural gas in their homes.
