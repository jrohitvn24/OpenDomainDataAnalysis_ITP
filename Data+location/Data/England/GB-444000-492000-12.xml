		<content> Unlike the national trend there is no 
 unemployment problem in this area,all 
 men have work.                        
 The major source of employment within 
 the region is in agriculture with 35% 
 of those who completed our survey     
 farmers or farm workers.              
 A very large proportion of men living 
 in Nether &amp; Over Silton travel outside
 the region to work largely because of 
 the A19 making major towns accessible.
 These are mainly professional/        
 managerial classes amongst them 7     
 Company Directors,a Bank Manager,     
 Accountant,Surveyor and Teachers.These
 people have tended to move into the   
 area within the past 10yrs.Established
 families are inclined to work locally.
 Only 10% of women have full time work.
 45% work part time,including Domestic 
 &amp; Clerical Workers,a Designer,a Flower
 Arranger and a P.E Teacher.           </content>
