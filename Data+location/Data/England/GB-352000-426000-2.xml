		<content>  {Kingsfold School}services a variety 
 of housing. Closest are mainly rented 
 terraced houses. Then we find 1930's  
 semi-detached and 1960-onwards semi-  
 and detached,3- or 4-bedroomed houses.
 There is also alot of'sheltered accom-
 modation'for old people.There is a set
 of about ten shops locally,which prov-
 ide most of our daily needs.For larger
 shopping trips we travel to Preston.  
   About one third of the children take
 a Summer holiday, many of them staying
 with relatives in different parts of  
 the country. The majority of families 
 have more than one television; well   
 over half have video recorders.       
   The major interest at home is watch-
 ing television,followed by computer   
 activities.Most children have bicycles
 but few use them for any distance. Few
 children have any developed hobbies   
 such as fishing, cycling or swimming. </content>
