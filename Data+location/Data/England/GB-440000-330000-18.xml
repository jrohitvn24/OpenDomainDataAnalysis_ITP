		<content>   Shardlow Hall is used by the        
 Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
 Food. At Shardlow Hall there are      
 several different departments. These  
 include, Soil Samples of England and  
 Wales, Entomology and Horticulture.   
 There is also a plant clinic at the   
 Hall.                                 
   As well as office and laboratory    
 work, those employed sometimes go to  
 conferences or to give talks. They    
 also visit farmers to give advice.    
   At Shardlow Hall there is a social  
 club for the employees.               
   Local legend says that the Hall is  
 haunted by a Lady in Grey who has been
 seen by the lake. The Lady in Green   
 appears when the roof is disturbed.
