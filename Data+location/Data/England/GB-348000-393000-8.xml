 town's Recreation and Leisure         
 Department.

 where many indoor and outdoor sports  
 take place.There is an "all weather"  
 area in one of the local parks which  
 is used by many local teams,both for  
 games and training sessions.          
   As well as the mainly physical

 older people to take part in sports   
 such as crown green bowling and
