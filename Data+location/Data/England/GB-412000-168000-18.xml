		<title>18A Walk from Fyfield</title>
		<content> The most convenient parking is in the 
 road to Lockeridge.                   
 A quarter of a mile along the A4 road 
 towards Calne is a path northwards    
 through Piggledene, a valley of sarsen
 stones. Bear westwards for half a     
 mile to pass barns, farm buildings    
 and an old cottage.                   
 Now turn right into{Fyfield Down      
{Nature Reserve.}After a mile turn     
 east into Stony Valley, and so out of 
 the nature reserve again.             
 This is called Clatford Bottom. On the
 way back to the A4 you pass the       
 dolmen called Devil's Den. You are now
 less than a mile from Fyfield where   
 you started the walk. There is a      
 footpath beside the road, rather      
 unpleasant because of the traffic, or 
 a longer route on the south side of   
 the A4, heading first towards Clatford
 and then to Lockeridge.               </content>
