 village with a population of 500.In   
 the village is a farm that belongs to 
 Fairlawn Estate.There are no shops in 
 Shipbourne so the people have to shop 
 outside the village.As there is a poor
 bus service people need cars.Lots of  
 the people live in converted buildings
 most of the buildings are quite old   
 but there are some modern ones.Not    
 many people work in the village they  
 commute to places like Tonbridge and  
 London.Shipbourne is a dormatory      
 village,people come here for peace and
 quiet.                                
       St Giles Church.
