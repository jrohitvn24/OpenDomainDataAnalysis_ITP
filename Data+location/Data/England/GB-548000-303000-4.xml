{ }THE PARISH CHURCH OF ST. CLEMENTS   
              OUTWELL                  
 This lovely parish church dates back  
 to the 13th century and other parts   
 were added in the 14th 15th 16th      
 century. It is dedicated to St.       
 Clement who was the third bishop of   
 Rome after Apostles. In the story of  
 St.Clement he was banished into the   
 Crimea where he converted the people  
 to Christianity.The Roman Emperor     
 Trajan ordered St.Clement to be thrown
 into the sea with an anchor. The      
 statue of the Virgin Mary can be seen 
 standing in front of the wrought iron 
 gates which lead into the Lady Chapel.
 The Lady Chapel is dedicated to the   
 Virgin Mary. There are some very nice 
 windows mostly 400 years old. The     
 North Aisle is dedicated to St.       
 Nicholas.It was built by John Fincham.</content>
