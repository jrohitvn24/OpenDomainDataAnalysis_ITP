		<content> THE AREA IS LARGELY SEA BUT INCLUDES A
 SMALL FRINGE OF THE NORTH CORNISH     
 COAST.THE PROMINANT HEADLAND OF       
 ST.AGNES HEAD JUTS OUT INTO THE       
 ATLANTIC OCEAN AND AFFORDS AN         
 EXCELLENT VANTAGE POINT FOR THE       
 COASTGUARD LOOKOUT SITED THERE.{THE   
{COASTAL FOOTPATH}SKIRTS THE HEADLAND  
 BUT TAKE CARE! THE CLIFFS ARE BOTH    
 HIGH AND EXPOSED.THERE ARE SEVERAL    
 DISUSED TIN MINES IN THE AREA, A      
 RELIC OF ITS FORMER PROSPERITY AND A  
 FEW OUTLYING FARMS WHOSE FIELDS ARE   
 MOSTLY PASTURE. MUCH OF THE LAND      
 HOWEVER IS ROUGH CLIFFTOP GRASSLAND   
 AND PART OF THIS HAS BEEN SET ASIDE AS
 A{PICNIC AREA}TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
 MARVELLOUS SEA VIEWS.
