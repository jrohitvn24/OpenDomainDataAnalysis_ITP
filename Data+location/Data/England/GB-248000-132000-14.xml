{At 10:15pm one night in August        
 1977 Mr Victor Kelly (now our school  
 caretaker) was on his way to work,    
 appears to have seen a ghost at       
 Fremington Church by the lychgate.It  
 was a woman.The lady was about 28.She 
 was dressed for a ball,wearing a long 
 blue gown and sandals,and carrying a  
 handbag.It was obvious that she came  
 from another time in history.She also 
 looked rich.Mr Kelly said she had a   
 kind of smile on her face and she was 
 healthy looking.She did not say       
 anything to him.She walked about      
 thirteen metres and disappeared into  
 the wall.He has never seen her since. 
 He went back about 3 times that night 
 but he never saw har again.Mr Kelly   
 thinks she was Lady McNeil who drowned
 on a beach saving a little boy.
