		<content> At half past two we catch the bus home
 to Broadwas and get off at the Village
 Shop. We then walk down to the church 
 and spend two or three hours cleaning 
 it. We then walk home and have a late 
 meal at seven o'clock. I watch        
 television for a while and then go to 
 bed.                                  
   On Sunday I get up at half past ten 
 and then go into the village for a    
 rehearsal with the Cedar's Orchestral 
 Group. After a late lunch I go to play
 with my friend again until eight      
 o'clock. My mother, who has been      
 playing the organ at church, comes to 
 tke me home. I get my things ready for
 school the next day then watch        
 television for a while before going to
 bed.
