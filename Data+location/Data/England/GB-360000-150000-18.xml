		<title>18Emborough Walls &amp; Coppices</title>
		<content> Dry stone walls and narrow lanes are a
 common sight in the Parish of         
 Emborough and surrounding areas.  Some
 are of Roman Origin and built of grey 
 stone quarried in the area.  ay walls 
 have now sunk beneath natural hedges  
 of thorn and hazel etc. and become    
 stone banks.  These form good shelter 
 for farm animals, wildlife and birds, 
 as do the numerous woods and coppice  
 which are mostly of deciduous trees   
 like the ash, Scycamore, Oak and ech. 
 Empty spaces are visible here and     
 there where the elm once stood in the 
 days before Dutch Elm Disease. The    
 small circular coppices which are seen
 in the larger walled fields were      
 planted as wind breaks to shelter     
 outlying cattle during the winter     
 months.
