		<content> Shildon has 6 schools. Sunnydale      
 Comprehensive admits all of the 11 to 
 16 age group in the town.It was built 
 approx.20 years ago. The 5 other      
 schools are Primary. Shildon County   
 school has 190 children and is housed 
 in a modernised building about 60     
 years old.It was originally an Infants
 school,but due to falling rolls the   
 Junior school which occupied the same 
 site was converted into Training      
 Workshops for the unemployed 3 years  
 ago and the Infants school became a   
 4-11 Primary school.Timothy Hackworth 
 School was built in 1911,and two      
 buildings existed on the same site,one
 housing an Infant school, the other   
 both a Junior school and a Girls      
 Sec. Mod. school.Reorganisation in the
 early and late 70's led to the        
 transfer of the Sec. schoolto the     
 Comp.and the joining of the I&amp;J.school</content>
