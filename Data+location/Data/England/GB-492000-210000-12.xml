 some questions.                       
    Q"How many years were you involved 
 with Tring council?"A"I should think  
 about 10 to 12 years."Q" How long were
 you a mayor for?"A"It has been the    
 tradition in Tring that you are a     
 mayor for 1 year."Q"Why did you choose
 to become a bookmaker?"A"When I was   
 young I went to the fair,I spent all  
 my money on pony rides so when I grew 
 up that was as close as I could get to
 horses."Q"How long have you been a    
 citizen of Tring?"A" About 24         
 years."Q"Did the people have to vote  
 for you to become mayor"A"Yes, but not
 directly.The public elect 12          
 councillors and the councillors vote  
 for the mayor."                       </content>
