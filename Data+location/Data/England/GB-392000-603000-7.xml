 There are no shops in our area except 
 the post office which sells sweets    
 and ice creans.                       
 There are two bakers vans and two     
 butchers vans travelling from house to
 house and the milk van calls on       
 Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.The  
 bakers also sell some provisions and  
 groceries.One of the bakers is based  
 in Ponteland and has called on        
 Tuesdays and Thursdays for many years.
   Local shopping is done in Rothbury. 
 Some go as far as Alnwick or Morpeth, 
 and into Newcastle for major shopping 
 including Christmas shopping.Some     
 people, who are in business, are able 
 to bulk buy at Wholesalers,the        
 nearest being in Morpeth.
