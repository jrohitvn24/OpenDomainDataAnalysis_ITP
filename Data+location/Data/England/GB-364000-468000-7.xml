		<title>07A FARM AT BENTHAM</title>
		<content> On our 200 acre farm we have 13 beef  
 cattle, sheep and dairy cattle. Each  
 season brings varied work on top of   
 the day to day routine. Spring time is
 our lambing season. We have 200       
 breeding ewes and about 400 lambs. In 
 Summer we cut the grass for silage to 
 feed the cattle in Winter. We also    
 make hay. The sheep are shorn and the 
 wool sent to the Wool Marketing Board.
 In Autumn our lambs are fat and go to 
 market. The dairy cows and beef cattle
 come inside for the Winter. Each day  
 of the year the cows have to be       
 milked, buildings cleaned out and     
 sometimes given drugs to prevent them 
 from becoming ill. We spread          
 fertilizer on the fields, hedges have 
 to be laid and dry stone walls        
 repaired.
