		<content>  {Tottington's Dungeon}is not in use  
 anymore, and when it was in use, it   
 was a small triangular shape with a   
 small steel door and not a lot of room
 inside.It would hold about six people,
 and inside it were those arm and leg  
 shackles with a stone bench to sleep  
 or sit on.                            
   It was not a real dungeon, it was   
 used for all the drunks and the ones  
 who cause trouble.The constable was   
 not a real policeman but a voluntary  
 job.The constable is reputed to have  
 left the doors of the dungeon open and
 let the prisoners escape to save him  
 the job of taking them to court.      
   In 1964, Salford folk museum wanted 
 to take it stone by stone off         
 Tottington's hands, but the locals    
 wanted to preserve it as a link with  
 the past, and to keep it as a         
 monument.                             </content>
