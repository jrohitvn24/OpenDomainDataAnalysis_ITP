		<content>         Handsworth and Woodhouse      
 are suburbs of the large city of      
 Sheffield and have a close community  
 atmosphere. Woodhouse is an old       
 village where the old stocks and      
 a cross still stand.There are large   
 new housing estates on the outskirts  
 built to accommodate workers          
 in the city. Handsworth is now more   
 industrialised than Woodhouse but     
 it also was originally an old village.
 There is a large industrial estate    
 with various types of factories,      
 warehouses and offices and also       
 Orgreave Coking Plant which was       
 prominent in the news in 1985. There  
 are some ancient sites including      
 Handsworth Parish Church which dates  
 back to     . The Cross Keys is the   
 only public house in England to be    
 sited in a graveyard and it has an old
 escape tunnel underneath it.          </content>
