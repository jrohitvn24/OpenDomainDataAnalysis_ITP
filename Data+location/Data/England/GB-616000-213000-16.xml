		<title>16SHOPPING IN CLACTON</title>
		<content> There are many different kinds of     
 shops in Clacton. Some are shoe shops 
 where you go to get footwear to your  
 fancy. Many people own their own      
 burger bars now,like Wimpy and        
 Mcdonalds all in the race for         
 publicity.Places like Marks and       
 Spencer, Woolworth and Tesco sell all 
 kinds of items,from gardening tools,to
 baked beans.These shops are called    
 Supermarkets.Some shops sell books    
 where you can buy them instead of     
 borrowing them from the library.There 
 are also sweet shops where there are a
 number of coloured sweets.Many of the 
 shops in Clacton cater for the holiday
 trade, selling items like beachballs  
 and sun hats, buckets and spades.     
 Clacton is fortunate in havinga branch
 of many High Street chains, such as   
 W.H.Smith, Boots, Halfords etc.
