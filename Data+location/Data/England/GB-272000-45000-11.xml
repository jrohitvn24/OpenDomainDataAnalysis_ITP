		<title>11PLANTS AND ANIMALS</title>
		<content> This part of Devon is mostly fields   
 and lanes and has lots of animals and 
 plants.                               
                                       
 The{hedgerows}are good for animals    
 because they provide shelter and food.
 We found that some of the hedgerows   
 were more than 200 years old and some 
 of the{footpaths}much older than that.
                                       
 Luckily for the{animals}the{farmers}  
 keep the hedges and think the wild    
 animals are good for the countryside. 
 We had surveyed some hedgerows for    
{flowers}during the year and have found
 over{40}different wild flowers growing
 on (or by) them.Lots of{insects}use   
 these flowers in the Summer and many  
 of the insects and plants are food for
 many different{Birds.                 
 There are lots more plants and wild   
 animals than people around here.      </content>
