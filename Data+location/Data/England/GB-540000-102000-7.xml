		<content>  Eighteen different species of birds  
have been sighted near the pond during 
1985.                                  
  This is the first year that the      
Canada Geese have nested on the pond.  
They have raised three goslings.       
  With the increase of wind-surfing and
sailing it is wondered if they will    
return next year and raise another     
brood or whether they will be scared   
away.                                  
                                       
            ~~~~~~~~~~~                
                                       
  A street lamp has been erected by    
the local residents in the approach    
road to the village hall as a memorial 
to the late Nelson Caplin (a resident  
of Piddinghoe) who ran the Post        
office. The lamp was lit for the       
first time during August 1985.
