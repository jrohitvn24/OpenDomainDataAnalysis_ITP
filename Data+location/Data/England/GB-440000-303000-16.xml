		<content> Churches and Chapels play an important
 role in our area and there is a       
 variety to choose from.Both Barlestone
 and Mkt. Bosworth boast a parish      
 church- St. Giles' and St. Peter's.   
 St. Peter's is built upon the site of 
 a Saxon Church, but most of the       
 building was constructe in the 14th.  
 and 15th. centuries, when the roof was
 raised and the clerestory added and   
 the spire built. There is an          
 interesting squint in the south aisle,
 through which the choir can be        
 observed.                             
        Like st. Peter's, st.Gile's    
 church is involved in the community   
 with a Sunday School and a fellowship 
 group. Both schools are linked with   
 the primary schools. There is a       
 Methodist Chapel and a Catholic Church
 in Barlestone,with a Free Church and a
 Catholic Church in Bosworth.          </content>
