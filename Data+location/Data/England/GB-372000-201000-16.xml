		<title>16LOCAL RADIO AND TELEVISION</title>
		<content>   The local radio which serves this   
 area is called{Severn Sound}which is  
 broadcasted from Gloucester. An       
 interview with a local listener showed
 these results: he said " It is a quite
 good programme for local news and     
 every one hour there is a National    
 news broadcast. Unfortunately the     
 programme is spoilt by too many       
 adverts and annoying signature tunes. 
    The area is served by a television 
 station "HTV" which mainly deals with 
 the larger towns like Gloucester, Bath
 and Bristol. There is a local news    
 broadcast after the six o'clock       
 national news on "BBC WEST".          
    The station "HTV" stands for       
 Harlech Television, Lord Harlech was  
 the Chairman of the British Board of  
 Censors.
