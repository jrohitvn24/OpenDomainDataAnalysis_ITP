		<title>10THE RAILWAY AT GLYNDE</title>
		<content> The{railway}is south of Glynde running
 through the parishes of Firle and     
 Beddingham. It still runs but it is   
 old and not very welcoming. To get on 
 to the platform you have to cross an  
{old wooden bridge.}The steps leading  
 down to the platform are old, rickety 
 and full of wood-worm. When you are on
 the platform you can realize what an  
{old station}Glynde has. There are two 
 lines, one running to Lewes and       
 Brighton, the other running to        
 Eastbourne. The station is not very   
 big and not very many people work     
 there or use it. For a start there is 
 no ticket-collector and tickets have  
 to be bought at the passengers'       
 destinations. The platform where we   
 waited was nothing but a{stone        
{shelter.}Across the line is another   
 old shelter for the people getting on 
 to the train going to Eastbourne.     </content>
