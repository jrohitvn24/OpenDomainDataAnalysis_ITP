		<content> Both main villages have{electricity,  
{mains water}and{main sewage}but if    
 you live out in the lanes you would   
 need a{septic tank}for your waste     
 water. If people want{gas}they would  
 have to buy in bottles because there  
 is no main gas. There isn't a{police  
{station}in either village but we do   
 have a village policeman who lives in 
{Stoke-St.-Michael.}If there is a fire 
 the fire engines would come from      
{Shepton Mallet.}In both villages      
 people can get their papers, bread and
 milk delivered. A fish and chip van   
 comes round on Saturdays and          
 Thursdays. A{library van}comes from   
{Frome}because we haven't a library.   
 The rubbish is collected once a week  
 by a company called Cleanaway. The    
{post}is delivered once a day to houses
 but twice to our school.
