		<title>08A child's day in Bacup</title>
		<content>  I am a girl. On Monday morning when I
 awake I read for a  while. When I get 
 up I have a breakfast of cereal and a 
 drink. Then I get dressed,brush my    
 teeth and hair and collect my dinner  
 money and lunch snack. I go with my   
 brother and sister but call for my    
 friend on the way. Before we go into  
 school at 9o'clock we play marbles.   
 When we go in we have assembly then go
 to class for religion,maths and       
 English lessons. We have a short break
 in the morning and afternoon and a    
 long one for dinner. For dinner we    
 have a choice of A or B menu.It is    
 different each day. In the afternoon  
 we have lessons again and at 3_30pm   
 mum comes to collect us. At home I    
 have an ice lolly made from fruit     
 juice,watch television,have tea and go
 to bed around 9pm. I read before I go 
 to sleep every night.                 </content>
