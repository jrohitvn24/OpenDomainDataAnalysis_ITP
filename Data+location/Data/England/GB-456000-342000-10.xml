		<title>10FIRE STATION AND FINE WIRES</title>
		<content> The new Fire Station,which is modern, 
 replaced the old one now used for     
 storage.There are two appliances with 
 one reserve.Thirty-two people are     
 employed at the station.              
 Fine Wires occupy three buildings     
 which were used for I&amp;R Morley,the    
 hosiery company.The first of three    
 buildings was built in 1885.Fine Wires
 make a variety of wires.80% of British
 telephone cords are made there and the
 braided gold wires for the insides of 
 N.A.T.O.Man Pack radios.              
 In 1872 the Great Northern Railway Co.
 built a line from Bulwell to          
 Nettlefield,passing through Arnot Hill
 Park,with a branch line to Nottingham.
 After World War 2,the line was closed,
 the rails removed,and the land sold   
 privately.At present there are 8      
 passenger routes passing through the  
 area.            S.Jamson             </content>
