		<content>  Our area has two places of worship,  
both situated in the village of        
Clipston. The Baptist Chapel and All   
Saints Church.                         
  Services were first held on the site 
of the Baptist Chapel in 1752.  It is  
the highest point in the village. The  
original Chapel was built in 1778.  The
present building was erected in 1803.  
  In the early years people came from  
all the surrounding villages to worship
in the way they wanted. It was called  
free prayer. The Chapel people thought 
that it was the spirit of fellowship   
to stay for the whole day and          
thoroughly enjoy themselves.  It was   
their weekly day out. The congregation 
at this time was made up of mainly     
tradesmen and their families.  The     
richer classes tended to go to their   
local Parish Churches. Competition     
arose between the two types of worship.</content>
