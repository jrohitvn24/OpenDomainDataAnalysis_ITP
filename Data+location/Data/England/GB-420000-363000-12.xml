		<content> Youlgrave is one of the most          
 attractive and historic villages in   
 the{Peak District National Park.}In   
 1983 much of the village became one   
 of the 20 conservation areas in the   
 Peak Park. This means that people have
 to get permission to demolish         
 buildings or cut down trees and       
 planning applications have to be      
 advertised by the Peak Park Planning  
 Board. Since we became a conservation 
 area money has been made available by 
 the Planning Board to repair the      
 Fountain, plant new trees in the dale 
 and repair some of the dry stone      
 walling. In our area kingfishers,     
 herons and badgers are all to be found
 but people who know where their nests 
 and setts are don't tell others so    
 that they won't be harmed. There is a 
 nature reserve in{Lathkill Dale.}
