 This area is mainly grassland and     
 farmland . It has a village which has 
 developed  along the main road in the 
 valley.The oldest building in the     
 village is the church which is a part 
 of the Diocese of Salisbury . The     
 school is a voluntary aided church    
 school.In recent years there  has been
 two areas  of housing development     
 basically   because of commuters      
 to near by town . The main road is a  
 holiday route to the west country.    
 In hard winters the village is often  
 cut off in each directoin because of  
 the high exposed land.
