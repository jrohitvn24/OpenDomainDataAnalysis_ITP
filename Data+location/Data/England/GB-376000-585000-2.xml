		<content> A butcher's van travels around much of
 the district. Some people buy their   
 meat from this. Others prefer to buy  
 meat and poultry when they are in     
 Bellingham, either at Kelly and       
 Anderson or Walton's shop. We buy     
 frozen fish and fish fingers from the 
 shops in Bellingham, fresh fish from  
 Hexham or from a van which comes from 
 Eyemouth to Bellingham weekly.        
 Fishermen can catch their own trout or
 salmon in season on the Tarset burn,  
 North Tyne or Klieder Water.          
 Most people have gardens and grow at  
 least some of their own fruit and     
 vegetables. The most commonly grown   
 are; potatoes, lettuce, cabbage,      
 cauliflower, Brussel sprouts,         
 beetroot, leeks, onions, parsnips,    
 peas &amp; beans. Some fruits grow wild   
 eg, crab apples, raspberries,         
 blackberries &amp; hazlenuts.             </content>
