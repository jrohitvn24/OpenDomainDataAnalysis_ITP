		<content> but some are specimen trees.We saw    
 Holly Oak,Ashes,Mock Orange,and       
 Yews.There are also a lot of          
 Beeches.We saw some Rhododendrons and 
 some were in flower.We could hear lots
 of birds and the sound of the         
 beck.Much of the trail runs along a   
 lake edge.As we walked by this lake we
 could see little except the sombre    
 reflection of trees and sky.Past the  
 lake is a "Grotto"where Reginald      
 Farrer rested when going to the       
 cave,just round the corner there are  
 pine trees and more light can get in. 
 Further on you can see the cave,there 
 is a stream running through the cave, 
 but that is another story.            
 Up past the cave about 0.125 mile     
 there is a small derelict cave called 
 "Dead mans cave".Just round the corner
 is"Trow Gill".You can either return   
 the same way or go down Clapdale Lane.</content>
