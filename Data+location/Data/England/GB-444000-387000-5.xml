		<title>05M1 MOTORWAY SURVEY</title>
		<content>                                       
   A traffic survey was taken by a     
 group of pupils at this school. The   
 survey was taken over several days and
 involved the counting of traffic on   
 the northbound and southbound lanes of
 the motorway. The survey was taken    
 from the bridge over the motorway near
 Guilthwaite.Calculations were based on
 on seperate fifteen minute time spans.
 Results showed that an average of{567}
 vehicles passed on the southbound     
 carriageway every fifteen minutes     
 while an average of a {1000}vehicles  
 passed during the same period of time 
 on the northbound lane. Therefore     
 approximately {2268 }vehicles pass    
 south per hour and {4000}vehicles pass
 north per hour.This shows clearly the 
 amount of traffic carried on the major
 trunk road. It causes considerable    
 disturbance for Upper Whiston.        </content>
