		<title>10CLUBS - THE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>                                       
 In l98l a long awaited community      
 project was realised with the opening 
 of a new village hall.   Much         
 voluntary help in its construction by 
 local residents meant the cost was    
 kept as low as possible - Â£36,000.    
                                       
 The main hall (60' x 30') has a       
 parquet floor and has been marked out 
 for netball and badminton.  There are 
 two committee rooms and a kitchen.    
 The Sea Angling Club is one of the    
 well established and most active in   
 the village and one room of the hall  
 has the special facility of a deep    
 trough for weighing fish.  Other      
 organisations include the             
 Evergreens (an old folk's club) Yoga, 
 Keep Fit, Badminton, Playgroup, Table 
 Tennis and Bingo.
