		<title>07Shopping, Thurleigh</title>
		<content> There is only one shop in Thurleigh   
 and this is also the village post     
 office. It is well stocked and there  
 is very little that cannot be         
 purchased there. The owner also       
 delivers newspapers to the village and
 will deliver groceries to anyone in   
 the area for no extra charge. The     
 village also has several fruit and    
 vegetable stalls, these are run from  
 private homes. The garage and filling 
 station also sells sweets, biscuits   
 and cakes. There are two mobile fish  
 vans that call weekly, one of which   
 also sells greengrocery. There is also
 a large frozen foods company based in 
 the area and they deliver anything    
 imaginable - ice cream, gateaux, meat,
 fish to name but a few. The milkman   
 calls on alternate days. There is just
 one public house now, there used to be
 3, a butchers and 2 general stores.   </content>
