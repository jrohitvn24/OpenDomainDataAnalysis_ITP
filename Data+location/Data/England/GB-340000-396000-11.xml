		<title>11A view on Sports in Kirkby</title>
		<content> My name is Sarah and on the 13th June 
 1985 I took part in a survey with 10  
 other members of my class to find out 
 if people had any thoughts on how the 
 sports facilities in Kirkby could be  
 improved.                             
 Many people seemed to think that the  
 charge for using the amenities offered
 in Kirkby Stadium should be reduced.  
 In many cases, however, they did not  
 realise the range of activities that  
 were offered there. For example, there
 are opportunities for gymnastics,     
 aerobics, weight lifting, cycling,    
 shooting and Karate. When they were   
 told this many people changed their   
 minds. A lot of people also thought   
 that the cost of playing golf and for 
 swimming at the local baths was too   
 expensive. I think that the reason why
 so many people are worried about the  
 expense is because they are unemployed</content>
