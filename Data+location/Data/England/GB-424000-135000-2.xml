		<content> Linking up with the wide network      
 of footpaths in the village of        
 Nether Wallop are the  straight       
 grass tracks between hedges flanked   
 by fields.  No doubt these "Green     
 Lanes" were once  used by drovers     
 from pasture to pasture.  The tracks  
 nowadays are still much in use by     
 farmers with tractors for access to   
 their fields.  But they are also very 
 frequently enjoyed by numbers of      
 people for recreational purposes:     
 riding, walking, and bird-watching.   
 So one must conclude that they are    
 used by a wider section of the        
 population than before. In the N.W.   
 corner tracks and paths are closed to 
 the public; they are  on W.D.(Porton) 
 land accessible at specified times    
 Paths have been lost by farmers not   
 reinstating them, others diverted     
 when original purpose has ceased.     </content>
