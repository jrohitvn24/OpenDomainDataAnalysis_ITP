		<title>16DAILY ROUTINE BY MICHAEL</title>
		<content>          At 6.45 my Radio alarm goes  
 off and I listen to Adrian John on    
 Radio 1. At 7.00 my  Mum comes in with
 a cup of tea. I drink it then have my 
 shower. I start off with the water    
 cold then gradually turn up the heat. 
 Then I get dressed and go downstairs  
 for my Breakfast. I have Weetabix with
 brown sugar and milk and Orange juice.
 While I eat I watch 'Popeye' on       
 T.V.A.M. After that I comb my hair,   
 brush my teeth and get ready for      
 school.                               
        When I get home after school I 
 change out of school uniform and watch
 T.V or play with my Computer. After   
 that I take the dog for a walk and    
 play with her in the Park. I then go  
 home and have my tea. Then I listen to
 my Radio or Read till Bedtime.        
                                       
                                       </content>
