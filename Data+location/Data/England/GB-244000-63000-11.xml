		<title>11BERE FERRERS W.I.</title>
		<content>   The W.I. try to help other people in
 their village and abroad. The W.I.    
 helped to restore the village pump.   
 The village pump is situated by the   
 church hall that was once the school. 
 The W.I. also provided curtains for   
 the church-hall. The W.I. received a  
 letter from a lady in Nigeria saying  
 that the people did not know how to   
 sew. The W.I. responded to the lady by
 sending packets of needlework         
 equipment to Nigeria.                 
   The W.I. heard about the famine in  
 Ethiopia so they decided to raise some
 money. The W.I. sold T-shirts to raise
 lots of money to send to Ethiopia. The
 W.I. had a talk about guide dogs for  
 the blind. In the lower part of the   
 village there is a conservation area, 
 cared for by the W.I. The W.I.members 
 complained to British Railways when   
 the train was going to be taken away. </content>
