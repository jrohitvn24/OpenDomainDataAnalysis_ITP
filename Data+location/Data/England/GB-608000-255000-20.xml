		<content>  Much of the work in this survey has  
been done by the children and teachers 
of Creeting St. Mary V.A.P. School,    
helped by kind people from the village.
  The children will now tell you about 
their school.                          
  "Our school is 114 years old. We     
have 39 children, 23 in the Juniors and
16 in the Infants. The youngest is 5   
and the oldest is 9.There are two      
teachers."                             
  "Our school has a pointed roof.      
This makes things echo when you sing,  
it sounds lovely."                     
  "Behind the infants' mobile classroom
is a little swimming pool and a field  
with a walnut tree that bends over     
because the west wind blows it."       
  "We have apple trees with juicy      
fruit."                                
  "The bell has a nest in it."         
  "I like this school."                </content>
