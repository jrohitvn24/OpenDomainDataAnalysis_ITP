		<title>17The Franciscan Friary</title>
		<content> The Friary was originally built in    
 1837 by Dunn and Hanson, although     
 never completed to the original       
 design. The main structure comprises  
 two three storey wings of brick with  
 stone dressings to the doors and      
 windows. The friary is attached to the
 church which was built between 1926   
 and 1929.                             
    At the moment there are 11 people  
 living in the friary, five of them    
 training to be priests but they no    
 longer belong to the Franciscan Order.
 The living quarters are much bigger   
 than you would think looking from     
 outside.The people living there are   
 very friendly and think of others     
 outside the walls. They have a large  
 room with a table for feeding tramps  
 who knock on the door.
