		<content>   A branch railway line between       
 Braintree and Bishop's Stortford was  
 built in 1864 and closed in 1952.     
 This disused railway has since become 
 a haven for wild-life and plants.  Oak
 and Ash trees have grown along it and 
 it has now been taken over by the     
 Essex County Parks Department and is  
 maintained by voluntary workers as a  
 country walk.                         
                                       
   The young river Chelmer flows       
 through the area providing water      
 meadows, pleasant walks and habitat   
 for kingfishers, moorhens and herons. 
 A small herd of deer occasionally     
 wanders into fields around Barnston   
 from nearby woodland.
