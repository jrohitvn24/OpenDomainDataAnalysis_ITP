		<title>14Customs in the Northill Area</title>
		<content> Since the 16th Century, a{May Festival
 has taken place on Ickwell Green and  
 many families from Northill have cont-
 ributed to its success. Bank Holiday  
 Monday, now the usual date, sees the  
 children and 'Old Scholars' (adults   
 who have attended the school) decorate
 a float &amp; hoops with flowers, don long
 dresses or peasant smocks and assemble
 by the pond. The May Queen and her    
 attendants, chosen from the Parish    
 every third year, head the procession 
 to Ickwell accompanied by music from  
 a brass band, in readiness for the    
 crowning ceremony and maypole dancing.
 The event always draws a large crowd. 
{Carol Singing}is well supported with a
 group of enthusiasts touring the area 
 during the week preceding Christmas.  
 Nowadays, few families seem to honour 
{'Guy Fawkes'}on November 5th, but tend
 to join organised parties locally.    </content>
