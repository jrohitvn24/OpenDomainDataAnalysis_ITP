		<title>11LOCAL CUSTOMS NEAR DEWSBURY</title>
		<content> In Gawthorpe stands the maypole which 
 has formed the central point of the   
 May Day procession and celebrations in
 the area for the past 111 years.      
 The maypole is also the finishing post
 for the World Coal Carrying           
 Championships which take place        
 annually on Easter Monday. Male       
 competitors carry a sack of coal      
 weighing 51 kilogrammes over a        
 distance  of approximately 1000       
 metres beginning at the Royal Oak     
 Inn.Women carry a weight of 10        
 kilogrammes over a shorter distance.  
 Tolling the Devil's Knell is a        
 Dewsbury custom dating back to the    
 fourteenth century.On Christmas Eve   
 the tenor bell in the Parish Church   
 is tolled once for every year since   
 Christ's birth.It was a common belief 
 that this custom kept the devil away  
 from Dewsbury.                        </content>
