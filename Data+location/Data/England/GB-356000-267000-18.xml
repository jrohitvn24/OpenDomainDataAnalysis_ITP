		<title>18Tenbury Church. 1</title>
		<content> Tenbury Church is at the bottom of    
 Church Street which is a cul-de-sac.  
   It is a stone church which has a    
 clock on its Tower.The church yard is 
 very beautiful and pleasant to walk   
 around.In 1770 there was a flood and  
 the main part of the church was       
 knocked down.There was also another   
 flood in 1886 and in the church it    
 shows on a plaque how high it rose(1  
 metre high) In the balcony there are  
 some more steps leading up to the     
 place where the bell ringers ring the 
 bells which is called the bell        
 tower.There are aisles all down the   
 sides of the pews.At the top of the   
 chancel there is a brass cross.There  
 is a font where babies are baptised   
 and it had a new wooden lid 20 years  
 ago.
