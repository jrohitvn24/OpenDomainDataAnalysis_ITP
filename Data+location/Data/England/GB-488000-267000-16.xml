		<title>16  WHAT I ENJOY DOING MOST.</title>
		<content> Sailing is my most enjoyable pastime  
 although I also enjoy photography.I   
 have not got a boat of my own yet,but 
 I am gradually saving up and with the 
 help of a holiday job I should be able
 to afford one by next season,1986.    
 At the moment I use the schools boat  
 or I crew for someone else.The closest
 available  water to me is  Pitsford   
 reservoir although I usually go to    
 Grafton where we sail Minor and       
 Enterprise class boats generally on a 
 Wednesday afternoon.                  
 As a member of the C.C.F.(Naval       
 section),I get a lot of opportunity to
 pursue my hobby.Sailing may seem a    
 very passive sport but in a force 5 or
 6 gusting it is not only exhausting   
 but also exhilarating.
