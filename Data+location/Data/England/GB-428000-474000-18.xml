		<content> Farm land covers most of the territory
 between North Lees and North Stainley.
 This being a distance of 2 and        
 a half miles situated on the north    
 side of Ripon.                        
   The majority of the land in this    
 area is owned by the Ecclesiastical   
 Commissioners who in their turn       
 contract the land to individual       
 farmers.                              
{  Middle Parks}Farm, which covers     
 approximately 300 acres grows barley  
 and wheat for cereal production. Also 
 land is used for sheep grazing.       
   The adjoining farm,{North Parks,}   
 covers approximately 260 acres. Again 
 most of the land is arable,growing    
 barley and wheat. Cattle, reared for  
 auction and grazing sheep are the     
 stock content of this farm.
