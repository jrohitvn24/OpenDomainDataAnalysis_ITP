		<content> There is a Primary School in School   
 Rd., Tendring. It was built in 1896.  
 It is a red brick building, typical of
 a village School of its time, and with
 several later outbuildings. It has    
 about 150 pupils aged between 5 &amp; 11. 
 They have a lot of space around them. 
 There are climbing frames for the     
 children to play on.  In the middle of
 the ground is a disused air-raid shed 
 which belongs to the Ministry of      
 Defence so the School does not use it 
 except for roses growing up the walls.
 In 1977 the children planted 10 trees 
 to commemorate the Queen's Silver     
 Jubilee - all but one, replanted with 
 a conifer, are growing well. There is 
 a plot for wild life studies which was
 once used for growing vegetables for  
 the School kitchen. The Head, who is  
 retiring soon, hopes to have a pond   
 dug for ecological studies.{          </content>
