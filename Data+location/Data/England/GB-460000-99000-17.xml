		<title>17THE GOSPORT LINES</title>
		<content>                                       
      This is the name given to the    
{defensive}line built around the town  
 of Gosport to defend the western side 
 of Portsmouth Harbour. Work was       
 started in the 17th. century and the  
 lines were altered and strengthened   
 in the 19th. century.                 
      Today, only two small sections of
{The Lines}can be seen; one in Clarence
 Yard, belonging to the M.O.D., the    
 other by Haslar Bridge and open to the
 public.                               
      We visited the latter section,   
 officially known as{Bastion One}but   
 commonly known as Vicar's Bank because
 of Trinity Church Vicarage inside the 
 bastion.                              
     {The Ramparts,}which we estimate  
 to be about five metres high, are very
 impressive.
