		<title>11INTRODUCTION TO WOOLACOMBE</title>
		<content>    Although strictly out of this area,
 the village of Woolacombe is very much
 part of the life of Mortehoe.         
 Descending Chapel Hill, the wide      
 expanse of sandy beach stretches for  
 three miles.  The village itself      
 nestles around the headland at the    
 northern end of the beach. In 1922    
 Woolacombe obtained recognition as a  
 separate village.  Before that it was 
 little more than isolated farmland,   
 with scattered farms.  In the Domesday
 Book it is referred to as Wolnecoma,  
 meaning Wolves' Valley. Today the     
 National Trust owns most of the area, 
 the gift of Miss Chichester of        
 Arlington Court,so that development is
 restricted to retain the open nature  
 of the dunes behind the beach, and the
 towering hills around the village.
