		<title>14Coombe valley nature trail</title>
		<content> The{Coombe Valley Nature Trail}was    
 first established in 1970 by the      
 Cornwall Naturalist Trust. It lies    
 within the bounds of Stowe woods, a   
 Forestry Commission woodland,which has
 both deciduous trees and conifers.The 
 valley is part of the parish boundary 
 between Morwenstow and Kilkhampton and
 has a small stream which rises near   
 Kilkhampton flowing through it to     
 Duckpool and the sea. The trail is    
 made up of 4 trails which vary from   
 walks along steep paths in new conifer
 plantations to gentle level sections  
 with established hardwood and conifers
 either side. The valley supports a    
 wide range of wild life and plants.   
 With care a wide range of species can 
 be seen such as badgers, grey         
 squirrels, hedgehogs, brimstone,      
 peacock, red admiral, finches,        
 woodpeckers, jay, kestrel.            </content>
