The Rector of Walgrave serves 3        
parishes, Walgrave, Old and            
Hannington. The Baptist Minister comes 
from Moulton.                          
                                       
In Walgrave there are the remains of a 
fortified manor house with its moat.   
There are also some medieval fish      
ponds.                                 
                                       
When doing the questionnaire, we saw   
the rector gardening in his dog collar 
and wellington boots. Two girls were   
nearly bitten by a dog.                
                                       
The information was collected by all   
the Juniors in the school.  The top    
junior class did all the typing. We    
all found it hard work but very        
interesting.                           
                                       </content>
