		<title>15FARMING - AGRICULTURE</title>
		<content>   A survey showed the area to be very 
 mixed in that the following{crops}were
 in evidence: wherat, barley, oil seed 
 rape, potatoes and sugar beet (which  
 is taken to the British Sugar factory 
 in Newark).                           
   The{animals}kept are pigs, which are
 bred and fattened to bacon weight.    
 They are sold to bacon factories      
 outside the county. Sheep too were in 
 evidence as were beef cattle, but no  
 dairy cattle.                         
  {Farming}appeared to be prosperous as
 new buildings were being erected, some
 to store grain, some for potato       
 storage and further pig development.  
 Beef cattle are raised intensively -  
 brought to the farm as stores and sold
 as beef.                              
   There was evidence of high          
 mechanisation with new large expensive
 machinery being used on farms.        </content>
