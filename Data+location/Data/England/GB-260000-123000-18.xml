		<title>18VILLAGE LIFE CHITTLEHAMPTON</title>
		<content> The ultimate in village cooperation   
 was carried to its friendly conclusion
 recently in Chittlehampton. The       
 butcher retired, so the assistant     
 butcher took over the general store   
 and the people in the general store   
 moved to the Post Office and the lady 
 from the Post Office still works      
 there. Confused? The local butcher    
 retired after running the shop for 30 
 years. This was the ideal opportunity 
 for his assistant of 27 years a       
 Chittlehampton man born and bred to   
 achieve his ambition. He took over the
 general store and added a butchery    
 department while the general store    
 owners moved 50 yards along the street
 to the Post Office. "We have all been 
 working together to be able to stay in
 the village".
