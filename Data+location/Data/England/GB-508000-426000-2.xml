		<title>02MYTON BRIDGE IN HULL</title>
		<content> The Myton bridge is named after one of
 the oldest parts of Hull - dating back
 to 1160.  The bridge forms part of a  
 major inner city ring road development
 known as the South Orbital road.  The 
 new road is designed to ease city     
 centre traffic.  The bridge was opened
 in 1980 by the Lord Lieutenant of     
 Humberside.                           
 As the bridge is over the River Hull  
 and river traffic has historic        
 precedence it must be raised at times 
 to allow river traffic to pass.  The  
 bridge is quite unique in that it is  
 about 1,000m long and is a 'counter   
 balanced,unequal span,cable stayed,box
 girder,swing bridge.                  
 This bridge cost Â£8 million to build  
 and is very busy as it takes docks    
 traffic to and from the M62 and Humber
 bridge arterial routes.               
                                       </content>
