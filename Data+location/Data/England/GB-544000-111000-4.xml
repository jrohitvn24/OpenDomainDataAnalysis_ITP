		<title>04History of Ringmer - 2</title>
		<content> A memorial on the floor of the Church 
 commemorates the "truly pious and     
 ingenious daughter of{Sir John Stapely
 of the Broil Place" who bequeathed    
 Â£100 for the instruction of the       
 children of Ringmer in letters and    
 needlework.  This was the foundation  
 of{The Stapely Charity.}Income from   
 the charity still goes into the       
 Primary School Prize Fund.            
 A famous Ringmer inhabitant was{      
{Timothy Tortoise}who lived during the 
 eighteenth century with the vicar,{   
{Henry Snooke}and his wife{Rebecca}at  
{Delves House.}He then passed into the 
 ownership of Rebecca's nephew, the    
 naturalist{Gilbert White}of Selborne  
 and figures prominently in his{       
{"Natural History of Selborne".}       
 Timothy's carapace is now in the      
 Natural History Museum in London.
