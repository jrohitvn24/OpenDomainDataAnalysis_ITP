		<content>{THE PEOPLE OF UPPER SUNDON}           
 The people of Upper Sundon, a small   
 village just outside Luton,were       
 surveyed to find out what they did in 
 their spare time and to act as a      
 comparison with the urban areas       
 already mentioned.The main pursuits   
 were gardening and leisure activities 
 centred upon public houses. This could
 be explained by the lack of facilities
 for both outdoor and indoor sports. We
 thought that this would encourage them
 to watch a lot of television.However, 
 the average viewing time per person   
 was only 3 hours 20 minutes per day,  
 watching mainly news programmes. The  
 people surveyed predominantly in the  
 upper age group and more likely to    
 spend their leisure time on pursuits  
 which were not reliant on television. 
 Other sports mentioned were swimming  
 and football taking place nearby.     </content>
