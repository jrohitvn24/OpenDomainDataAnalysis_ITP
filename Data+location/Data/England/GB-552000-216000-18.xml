     {another eleven year old girl     
   The landscape here is beautiful. All
 around you are houses which are two or
 three hundred years old and fine trees
 lining the gardens. From one of the   
 school windows can be seen a huge fir 
 tree in the grounds of a house called 
 'Great Chalks' which was built as the 
 vicarage about 150 years ago. Hatfield
 Broad Oak also has many fine horse    
 chestnut trees.                       
   Wherever you stand just outside the 
 village you can look across green and 
 yellow fields to the old priory       
 church. Indeed this village and the   
 surrounding countryside has many      
 lovely views. I hope they will not be 
 destroyed by the expansion of         
 Stansted, only seven miles away, to   
 become London's third airport.
