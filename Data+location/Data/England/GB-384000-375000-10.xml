		<title>10NETHER ALDERLEY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In 1628 the original school was built 
 by the church for boys.Then in 1822   
 Lady Stanly built this school for     
 girls and infants.In 1867 the boys    
 joined the girls and infants.In 1907  
 there were 57 pupils.Then Warford     
 school closed and the pupils increased
 to 100.In 1907 the children were sent 
 from Warford by horse and cart to     
 Nether Alderley.In some rooms today   
 you can still see the hooks for the   
 oil lamps.The kitchen was the first to
 be built in Chesire because Lady      
 Stanley didn't like to see the        
 children going home for lunch.Lady    
 Stanley built a special wooden        
 cupboard with a glass front which kept
 socks ad shoes incase the children    
 came with wet feet.Now the school is  
 a County Primary School.It has 65     
 children and 4 teachers.It has 4 rooms
