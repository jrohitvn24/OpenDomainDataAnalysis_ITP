		<title>10THE M25 AND M3</title>
		<content>      The main feature of the road     
 communications  of this area is the   
 intersection between the M25 and the  
 M3.  The M25 is a three lane motorway 
 and this section between Chertsey and 
 Heathrow Airport was opened in 1981   
 providing direct access to the Airport
 and another bridge over the River     
 Thames to the north.  It is used by   
 Airport workers and Heathrow          
 travellers.                           
      During the construction of the M3
 in the l970s and the M25, many of the 
 local roads had to be diverted or cut 
 off and there was much local concern  
 about the effect of motorway pollution
 on the surrounding area, as the routes
 cut across agricultural land.         
   Chertsey itself, with a small       
 one-way traffic system around the     
 shopping precinct seems to have been  
 saved from major road alterations.    </content>
