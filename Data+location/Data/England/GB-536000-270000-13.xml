		<content> The local{Market Gardener}owns 3 acres
 on which he grows pyrethrums,         
 delphiniums and sea lavender. Inside  
 the 9 greenhouses he grows dianthus   
 and peppers.The site was previously an
 orchard.                              
 Days{Nursery}has 22 glass and 2       
 plastic greenhouses on 3 acres of     
 land.About 7,000 plants are grown in  
 each house, heated by oil fired fans. 
 Chrysanthemums and stocks are         
 transported to London and sold at     
 Covent Garden.Every year the          
 greenhouses are sterilised with the   
 poisonous bromide gas so they must be 
 sealed for 10 days.Specialists carry  
 out this work.The busiest time of the 
 year is between October and December. 
 Many of the{orchards}in the village   
 have disappeared as new housing       
 estates have been developed.
