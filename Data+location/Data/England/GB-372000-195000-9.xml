		<title>09Farming in the Nibley area</title>
		<content> The farms are mostly about 100 acres. 
 This is a good area for pastoral      
 farming in the shadow of the          
 Cotswolds.The majority of stock are   
 dairy and beef cattle.Dairy cattle can
 be kept cheaply due to high rainfall  
 but milk production has been cut by   
 the European Economic Community milk  
 quotas.This has affected jobs;the EEC 
 bring in imported milk,and more people
 have turned to growing crops.Milking  
 has become much more advanced due to  
 computerised machines:this makes      
 milking more efficient.More farmers   
 are making silage,although hay is     
 still being made as it aids digestion.
 Silage is made in round bales and     
 stored in airtight bags to stop it    
 going mouldy.There are special        
 chemicals which double the amount of  
 lactic acid in the grass,so the silage
 will keep better.                     </content>
