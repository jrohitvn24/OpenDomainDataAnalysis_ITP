		<title>09Pontefract Open Cast Mine(2)</title>
		<content> The people of Ridgeley Hill met and   
 talked about the Open Cast Mine.  They
 decided to draw up a petition to try  
 and stop Open Casting.  It did not    
 work.  Reasons for taking the petition
 around were 1.  They did not want the 
 dirt.  2.  They did not want a public 
 footpath destroying.  As the petition 
 did not work they chose 3 people to   
 put forward complaints to the         
 N.C.B.,while the Open Casting was in  
 progress.  Three people meet with the 
 N.C.B. every 8 weeks to try to reslove
 the problems.  Things discussed are a)
 strength of blasting  b) the amount of
 dust  c) height of the burden  d) how 
 much coal to be taken out.  The Liason
 Committee wish that the mine was not  
 there and they are looking forward to 
 it being fields again.                
                                       
                                       </content>
