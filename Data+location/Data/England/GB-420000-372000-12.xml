		<title>12Garden Centre, Calver.</title>
		<content> On an open site at Calver Crossroads, 
 in the grounds of a former Boot       
 Factory, now used only for storage, is
 a Garden Centre. This does not grow   
 plants but holds stocks of container- 
 grown plants and shrubs, fertilizer,  
 bulbs and all types of equipment      
 needed for making and maintaining     
 gardens. It also sells stone troughs  
 and pots, to match the local stone.   
 The garden centre is open every day   
 and has a spacious car park which is  
 often full at weekends, with cars     
 parked on both sides of the road as   
 well. It attracts people from a wide  
 area and provides work for local women
 in the shop.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
