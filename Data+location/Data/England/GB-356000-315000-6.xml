		<title>06SCHOOL FETE HIGH ERCALL</title>
		<content> Our School Fete started with a fancy  
 dress parade. The first prize went to 
 a boy who was dressed  as a skeleton. 
 There were about six main selling     
 stalls. There were Toys  Books,       
 Plants, Biscuits, Handicrafts, Cakes, 
 Sweets and Tombola stalls. Games      
 included Guess the Weight of the      
 Guinea Pig, Name the Mouse and a lot  
 more. There was a Grand draw with nine
 prizes to win. The first prize was a  
 Patio Set. There were some            
 attractions. One was a Vintage        
 Tractor which gave rides around the   
 field. Radio controlled cars whizzed  
 around the carpark. R.A.F Shawbury    
 sent a red and grey fire engine and it
 was good. Model boats came and they   
 were very detailed and accurate models
 which were made by a man from         
 Shrewsbury.
