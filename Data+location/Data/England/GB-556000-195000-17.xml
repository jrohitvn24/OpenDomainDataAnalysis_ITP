		<content> On the 26th of June we went to do a   
 farm survey for our Domesday project. 
 We went to Cowes farm, on a mini bus. 
 We saw machinery like tractors,       
 sprayers and potato spreaders.The lady
 who showed us around was called Mrs.  
 Norris. She took us to the crop field.
 There were marrows runner beans and   
 sweet corn. There were lO5 cows and 10
 people are employed. There was one    
 brown bull. There were also l3        
 tractors. The crops that are sold are 
 milk, greens, hay and straw. Most of  
 the crops are sown in Autumn.
