		<title>01Beverley (East)</title>
		<content> This area of Beverley is to the east  
 and south of the town centre, the     
 railway lines being a local boundary. 
      In the past the Grovehill and    
 Beckside areas of the town must have  
 resembled busy villages which have    
 since been swallowed up in the        
 consequent development made necessary 
 by a growing population.              
      Beverley Beck is no longer a busy
 waterway,nor is it as badly polluted  
 as it was in days gone by.  Nowadays  
 it is a pleasant place for a stroll.  
      Overshadowed by the imposing     
 Minster,this area if a mixture of     
 terace housing, modern estate housing 
 and large detached dwellings.  Many of
 the families living here have long    
 associations with this area and still 
 regard the centre of Beverley as being
 "up town".
