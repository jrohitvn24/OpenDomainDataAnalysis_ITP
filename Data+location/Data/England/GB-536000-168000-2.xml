		<title>02The Gypsy Queen</title>
		<content>{The Gypsy Queen }died in 1740 and is  
 buried in St Georges Churchyard in    
 Beckenham.She was buried in a special 
 coffin because she could not be       
 straightened.She had always sat in    
 a crouched position, with her knees   
 tucked under her chin.                
 Local publicans paid for her funeral  
 because they had benefited from the   
 flocks of people who came to see this 
 ancient old woman of 93 years.After   
 her death her body lay in state on {  
{Penge Common},which was the home for  
 many Gypsies and their brightly       
 painted caravans.
