		<title>17A WORKING DAY</title>
		<content> I woke at seven o'clock,had breakfast,
 got washed and dressed.I helped with  
 the dishes,fed the cat and practised  
 my clarinet before going to school.At 
 school I read my book,went to         
 assembly and did English work before  
 the swimming lesson.At the baths I    
 swam 400 metres and trod water for    
 three minutes.After a lunch of        
 sandwiches,apple and fruit cake I     
 played with my friends.               
  I wrote a story in the afternoon,    
 watched a television programme and    
 after school I went to gymnastics     
 club.                                 
  For tea I had lamb chops,vegetables  
 and cake.I went to the youth club.At  
 nine o'clock I had a bath,brushed my  
 hair and teeth and read my book before
 going to sleep.
