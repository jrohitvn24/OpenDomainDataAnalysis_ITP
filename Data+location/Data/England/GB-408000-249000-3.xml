		<title>03Amery Lodge Farm (l)</title>
		<content> This old property is a very good      
 example of how old farm houses have   
 been converted into many homes,       
 generally built around the old farm   
 yard and incorporating the out        
 buildings. Reference to North         
 Lyttleton can be found in the Domesday
 Book (note change of spelling). The   
 first reference to Amery Lodge was    
 made during the Civil War. The        
 property and land was owned by the    
 Sandys family. There were three       
 brothers who fought for the Royalist  
 cause and as a consequence they lost  
 their land and home. They also        
 quarrelled with Charles 11 and their  
 lands were given to the Crown.Early in
 the Cl8th Queen Anne gave the farm and
 land to the Churchill family and it   
 became part of the Blenheim Estate.
