		<title>09EMPLOYMENT AROUND PRIVETT</title>
		<content> Since farming is much less labour     
 intensive than it used to be, fewer of
 the families living in the Privett    
 area are connected with the farms.    
 Many commute daily to the nearby towns
 and even as far as London. Cottages   
 which, only a few years ago, were     
 occupied by farmworkers' families are 
 now let to retired farmworkers and    
 private families. Apart from the      
 farmers' sons few of the young people 
 choose to work on the land when they  
 leave school and travel into the      
 nearby towns for employment.  During  
 the summer holidays the older boys may
 help with the harvest, often carting  
 and stacking straw bales. Farmworkers 
 get a free cottage, some a milk allow-
 ance and firewood. They work a basic  
 40 hour week and overtime with 4 weeks
 holiday. They work long days including
 weekends in Summer.                   </content>
