		<content> At the Grimsthorpe gymkhanas lots of  
 horses and ponies go there.There is   
 even a dog parade.The ponies all get  
 dressed up in their fancy dress and   
 the riders get dressed up too.Then    
 they get ready for the proper         
 games.There is a potato race.That is  
 where you have to pick up potatoes,put
 them in a bucket and stay in the      
 saddle.There is a apple bobbing       
 game.That is where you get off and get
 an apple,then get back on and ride to 
 the finish.There are lots more games  
 to play.But there is show jumping     
 aswell.There is even                  
 cross-country.That is where there are 
 very hard jumps.They have to jump down
 very steep hills and some of the      
 horses get injured.They have to get to
 the finish at a certain time.The one  
 who gets the fastest time is the      
 winner.                               </content>
