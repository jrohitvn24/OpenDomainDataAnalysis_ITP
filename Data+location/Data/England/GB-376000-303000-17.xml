		<content> Recreation in the study area covers a 
 wide range of activities ranging from 
 the Albrighton Hunt at one end to the 
 gardening facilities available for the
 individual at David Austen Roses.     
  Along the course of the Worfe coarse 
 fishing is permitted as well as in the
 pools of Hatton Grange .But here it is
 only open to estate workers,their     
 families and guests at the house.Trout
 fishing also takes place along the    
 Worfe but is on the decline with the  
 lowering water table.Game shooting is 
 done on a number of the estateswith   
 the main centre being Hatton Grange.  
  Fox hunting is followed by members of
 the Albighton Hunt whilst Albrighton  
 Cricket Club has its ground in Bowling
 Green Lane which once had a bowling   
 green in it.Many of the facilities of 
 R.A.F. Cosford are used by local clubs
 and schools(see section on Sports).   </content>
