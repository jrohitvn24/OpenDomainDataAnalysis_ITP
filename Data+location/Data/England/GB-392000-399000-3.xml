		<content> Most mornings I am woken up at 7      
 O'clock by my brother's radio alarm. I
 lie in bed listening to it until 7-15 
 and then I rush to have a wash and get
 dressed so I can see the cartoons on  
 TV-AM at 7-25. All the family eat     
 breakfast together and then I read the
 newspaper called 'The Sun'. I like the
 sports pages best. I leave the house  
 at 8-30 and walk to school through the
 park. It takes me about 12 minutes to 
 reach school but I can do it much     
 faster if it is raining. School lasts 
 from 9-00 until 3-30 and I think it is
 great. I walk home after school with  
 my brother. I don't go with him       
 because he makes me late. I watch     
 children's television and after tea I 
 read for a while because my Dad makes 
 me. I go to bed at 9-00.
