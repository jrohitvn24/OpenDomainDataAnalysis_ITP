		<title>04Home life in Gretton</title>
		<content>Mr.and Mrs.Parman moved to 13,Stafford 
Road, Gretton in August 1977 because   
they liked the idea of living in a     
village not too far from Corby, where  
they both worked. Also the price of the
house was within their financial limits
and they were not concerned about there
being no gas connected to the village. 
     Stafford Road is part of "The new 
estate" as the locals call it, because 
it is at the edge of the village. It is
made up of one long, winding road with 
3 cul-de-sacs going off it. Many of the
dwellings are ideally situated for open
views over the countryside, ours       
included. We are very happy here,      
especially because of the situation of 
the house,across from the recreation   
field,2 minutes walk away.There are    
many organisations within the village  
and it is a thriving,community.
