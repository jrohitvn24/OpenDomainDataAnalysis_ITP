		<content> Every July in Todwick there is a{fete 
 held in the{rectory}garden. This year 
 we were raising money for the Church  
 Tower Appeal as Mr Froggat is our     
 vicar and he organises it.We have     
 stalls like the Pantry stall,The      
 Tombola, The Sweet Stall with homemade
 sweets and a cake stall. There are    
 also games like pillow fighting,      
 croquet, putting marbles in a jar with
 a fork, Bran tub and hoopla. There    
 was also donkey rides and a pony trap 
 and a chance to beat the{Barnsley F.C.
 Reserve goal keeper. You had to guess 
 how many balloons were in a car and   
 the nearest guess won, also there were
 raffles,flower,Hot dog,material and   
 balloon stalls. Refreshments were     
 available and at the end there was an 
 auction with ornaments and household  
 goods you had to bid for. The Â£2000   
 raised was Â£300 more than the target. </content>
