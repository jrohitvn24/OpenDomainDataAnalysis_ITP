		<title>03The games children play</title>
		<content> This game is called {Kingy.}All the   
 players(any number)stand in a ring    
 with their legs apart.One boy is king,
 one girl is queen and another player  
 is jack.The king bounces the ball into
 the middle of the circle and whoever's
 legs it goes through is the player who
 is "on".All the others quickly run    
 away while the person who is "on"     
 bounces the ball ten times.Then he/she
 tries to hit any person with the ball.
 When someone is hit they are also "on"
 and can help to eliminate the others. 
 The players who are not "on" cannot   
 hold the ball with their hands but can
 hit it with their fists.
