   The surrounding boundaries to the   
 fields are usually hedges.            
   These hedges are the main habitats  
 for many varieties of wildlife        
 including hedgehogs,rabbits,mice,birds
 and insects.                          
   These hedges are sometimes very     
 significant,as they mark the terminal 
 boundaries of two farmers' lands.     
   However these hedgerows are a       
 handful for the farmers to keep and   
 many tend to pull them them up and use
 fences instead,as in many cases in    
 this area.Pulling the hedges down can 
 be very destructive to the wildlife   
 that used to occupy the hedges.       
   The actual countryside is fairly    
 undulating and some hills can be very 
 steep as can be seen when going       
 through Little Hadham.
