		<content> The disappearance of the hedgerow elm 
 dramatically changed the landscape.   
 Extensive replanting of deciduous     
 trees by the Tree People and other    
 groups, aided by fertile soil,        
 high rainfall and springs that abound 
 here. Lime-loving beeches are forming 
 new avenues down Kilmersdon Hill and  
 Charlton.                             
 Modern farming methods have brought   
 their problems, particularly damage   
 from chemical weed-killer sprays. Wild
 flowers common twenty years ago almost
 disappeared, lack of funds have       
 reduced the use of controlling agents 
 and as a result they are showing signs
 of recovery. Hedgerows shelter animal 
 life (incl. shrews, rabbits,          
 hedgehogs, weasels and stoats). There 
 are birds in great variety including  
 heron and plenty of the commoner sorts
 of butterflies.                       </content>
