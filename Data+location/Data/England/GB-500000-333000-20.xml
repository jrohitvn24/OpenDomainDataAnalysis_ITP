		<content> This is a rural area relying heavily  
 on personal rather than public        
 transport. There is a single{bus}     
 through Braceby and Sapperton on      
 Saturday afternoon to Grantham;Ropsley
 has a regular bus service.There is a  
 school bus to Corby Glen Secondary    
 school and village children go to     
 Ropsley Primary school by taxi.       
 Caythorpe Agricultural College also   
 has a mini-bus service for students.  
 There are 31{cars}in the area as well 
 as{bicycles} and{motor bikes.}There is
 a good network of minor{roads}giving  
 reasonable access. The width of these 
 roads is such that for cars to pass   
 it's usually necessary to drive on the
 verge.The roads are kept in reasonable
 repair by the County Council. The     
 narrow roads are liable to closure by 
 drifting snow, clearance is by local  
 farmers as agents of the Council.     </content>
