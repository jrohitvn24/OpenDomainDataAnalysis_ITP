		<title>07FARMING/OVERTON+MIDDLETON</title>
		<content>Until around 1945,Overton was largely a
farming community.The farms were       
generally small,and farmers shared the 
grazing on the marshes.Since then,much 
land has been sold for building,and    
some farms have amalgamated.Around a   
dozen farms,using the name "farm",are  
now private dwellings,with little or no
land.Those remaining are mixed farms,  
some milk and beef,others fatstock,or  
rearing sheep.There is 1 piggery;hay   
and silage in summer,but very little   
arable land;a few potatoes,and barley  
being the only crops.The land is       
fertile and free-draining.A number of  
families,with large gardens or a few   
acres,keep geese,turkeys and poultry,  
and many have goats.In most cases,sons 
will succeed fathers on the land.Land  
prices are so high,that some farmers   
have formed a "co-operative".
