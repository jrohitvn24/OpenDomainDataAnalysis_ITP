		<title>14CARAVANNING IN KEWSTOKE</title>
		<content> Although the majority of the caravan  
 sites, containing some 550 static     
 caravans and 36 touring pitches in    
 Sand Bay and Kewstoke are south of    
 this area, there is one field on      
 which residential caravans are sited. 
 This, with Pontins Holiday Camp, are  
 the temporary homes for most of the   
 holiday makers who visit the area.    
 Caravans as places for holidays appeal
 to those who prefer a greater         
 freedom than can be had in hotels or  
 guest houses and also provide a       
 greater contrast to their normal way  
 of life.  This type of holiday also   
 appeals to parents with young         
 children.                             
 More than half of one class at        
 Kewstoke school had experienced a     
 holiday in a caravan  Without         
 exception all enjoyed the experience..
