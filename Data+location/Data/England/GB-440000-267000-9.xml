		<title>09A Village Pub,Marton.</title>
		<content> We visited a local village pub and    
 found out how it is run.The pub was   
 built in the 17th century. It sells   
 soft drinks,sweets, off sales and a   
 lot of bar meals as well as alcohol.  
 Although it is a village pub 90% of   
 the customers come from Coventry.     
    Another function of this pub is the
 display in the bar of advertisments   
 for local cricket games and charity   
 functions.We were told that their     
 busiest day was Saturday. They have a 
 lot of foreign visitors because they  
 advertise themselves on the main road 
 as a 17th century inn.                
     Custom in the summer is increased 
 because of the outdoor facilities,    
 which allow people to bring along     
 their children.As a result of our     
 visit we decided that although it was 
 in a village it did not function as a 
 village pub.                          </content>
