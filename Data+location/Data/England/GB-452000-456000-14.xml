		<title>14   Gas Comes to Shipton</title>
		<content> For the first time ever Shipton people
 will be able to choose between gas and
 other fuels because the Gas Board have
 brought gas to the village so we sent 
 out a questionnaire asking if they    
 wanted gas and if they thought gas was
 safe etc.Slightly over \ the people we
 asked wanted gas.Approx.3/4 of the    
 people thought gas was safe 3/4       
 thought gas was easier to use than    
 other fuels.Some people wanted gas    
 because it is cheaper to run more     
 efficient and convenient, people also 
 liked it because it is cleaner and    
 provides heat immediatly and is more  
 reliable.But some of the people who   
 wouldn't like it say it is expensive  
 to install,dirty,harder to use and is 
 dangerous.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
