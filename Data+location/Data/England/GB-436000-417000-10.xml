		<title>10What Children Wear.</title>
		<content>  Most of the the girls at our school  
 wear jewellery. They have earrings and
 often wear rings and necklaces and    
 bangles. They do not wear make-up but 
 do use nail polish. At school they do 
 not have a uniform but wear what they 
 choose. Girls usually wear trainers,  
 tight jeans, shorts or skirts. Not    
 many girls wear dresses. Their tops   
 are either tee-shirts, sweat-shirts   
 and short sleeved woollen jumpers.    
 Most of the girls have short hair and 
 some of them have it permed.          
                                       
  Nearly all boys wear jeans and       
 trainers at school. They also wear    
 tee-shirts, jumpers and body-warmers. 
 Their hair is usually short and some  
 have it very short. Some boys wear    
 earrings.
