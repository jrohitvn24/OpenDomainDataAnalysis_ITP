		<title>01A BRIEF VIEW OF OWERSBY</title>
		<content> North Owersby the only village,and in 
 the centre of this block lies 6 miles 
 from Market Rasen and 20 miles from   
 Lincoln the spires of whose cathedral 
 can be seen from various view points. 
 Nearby is the hamlet of S.Owersby with
 farms and houses scattered over the re
 maining area.There is 1 shop,no school
 no meeting place and very little new  
 building in the block.Most of the land
 is intensively farmed with fields vary
 ing from less than 1 acre to over  200
 though there is still some old pasture
 with rig and furrow evident.The area  
 lies from 25 to 100ft above sea level 
 with sandy soil in the east and clay  
 in the west.There has been some tree  
 replanting,much of it hardwood,both on
 roadside verges and in odd spots.Of a 
 population of about 220,less than 50% 
 of the adults work within the block.  
 20% are either retired or unemployed. </content>
