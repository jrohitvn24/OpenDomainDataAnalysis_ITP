		<content> Most housewives here do their own     
 housework and appliances such as      
 washing machines and vacuum cleaners  
 are almost universal. Home freezers   
 are used in many homes. The           
 traditional English Sunday lunch of   
 roast meat and potatoes is very       
 popular. Eating in the garden in fine 
 weather is common with food either    
 cooked in the house or barbequed      
 outside. Occasional friends are       
 invited for an evening meal           
 especially during the long winter     
 evenings. Most of the homes have      
 television and this is the most       
 popular form of home entertainment.   
 Hobbies such as oil-painting, sewing, 
 upholstery and furniture restoring are
 also practised. Many homes have pets -
 dogs, cats and rabbits are typical.
