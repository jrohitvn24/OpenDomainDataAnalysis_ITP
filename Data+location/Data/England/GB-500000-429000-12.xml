		<title>12ST. ANDREW'S CHURCH KIRKELLA</title>
		<content>  Vicar The Rev.Canon J.C.H. Wilson    
 M.A. ,Hon.C.F.                        
 The 1st definite mention of the church
 was in 1085 in the original Domesday  
 Book;although a Saxon church probably 
 existed long before.The church was    
 part of the manor of the Norman Knight
 Gilbert Tison.His son William granted 
 the church and its lands to the Abbot 
 of Selby.                             
 The oldest part of the church         
 remaining is the chancel which was    
 built in the 13th century.            
 The tower which dominates the present 
 day village centre was built in 1450-4
 and 3 bells hung which still remain . 
 Much of the late 18th and early 19th  
 century work was paid for by the Sykes
 family who had bought the manor in    
 1783.In the 1960's and 1970's much    
 repair work was carried out to the    
 organ,the tower and bells and pews.   </content>
