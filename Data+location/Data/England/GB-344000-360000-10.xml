		<title>10Saighton Village life (1).</title>
		<content> All property in Saighton is owned by  
 the 6th Duke of Westminster, and Lady 
 Mary Grosvenor,the daughter of the 2nd
 Duke,lives there.The majority of the  
 256 people(13 being over 65 &amp; 1 over  
 90) are pensioners of the Grosvenor   
 Estate &amp; the rest work on it.Some of  
 the Victorian Gothic houses have sugar
 loaf chimneys &amp; all have gardens.They 
 now have inside sanitation,some have  
 garages &amp; some telephones (but near   
 the primary school is a public phone).
 There is mains sewerage &amp; electricity 
 but no gas.Once "The White Horse"pub  
 the shop-cum-post office is the centre
 of village gossip (mainly by women).By
 the shop is a post box with twice     
 daily collections.There is no church  
 (&amp; Bruera church is 1 mile away) so   
 Holy Communion service is held once a 
 month at Saighton Grange school even  
 though there is a village hall.       </content>
