		<content> a mill where locally grown corn was   
 ground.  The blacksmith's smithy is   
 now used as a garage for a house, but 
 the bellows and old tools are still   
 there.  One house was built in 1870   
 for the schoolmaster.  It has been    
 extended and is now a private house.  
    The Cock Inn at the end of the lane
 is a pub and restaurant.  About 40    
 years ago it was a farm with a licence
 to serve drinks.  When a new farm was 
 built the old one became a pub.       
    The village post box has VR on it.
