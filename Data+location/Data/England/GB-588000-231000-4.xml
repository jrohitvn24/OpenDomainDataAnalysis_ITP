		<content>    The 7th of June was a wet,cold and 
 windy day.We had to be at the station 
 by ten past eleven because the train  
 left at twenty past eleven.It was     
 quite boring waiting for the train    
 because it was going to be ten        
 minutes late.Before we got on the     
 train the drivers drove to Chappel    
 station and they would meet us there. 
 When the train arrived we went up on  
 to the platform and got on the        
 train.We all had a seat and we sat    
 altogether.The journey was eight      
 minutes long.From the view out of the 
 window you could see a few houses with
 a hedge in front.We got off at Chappel
 and when we had got off,the train made
 its way to Marks Tey.When we went down
 to where the cars were we made our way
 back to school.
