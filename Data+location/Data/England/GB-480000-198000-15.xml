		<title>15TRADESMEN - LACEY GREEN</title>
		<content> THERE ARE MANY SMALL TRADESMEN IN THE 
 AREA AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET ALMOST 
 ANYTHING FIXED, FROM A T.V. TO A LEAK-
 ING ROOF. IN THE LOCALITY ARE SEVERAL 
 SMALL FAMILY BUILDING FIRMS WHO ARE   
 CONSTANTLY BUSY WITH NEW HOUSES AND   
 EXTENSIONS. THERE ARE THREE{PLUMBERS/ 
{HEATING ENGINEERS, ELECTRICIANS, A    
{WINDOWCLEANER, JOINERS, AN ODDJOB MAN,
{A T.V. REPAIR MAN, A TREE SURGEON AND 
 A NUMBER OF{GARDENERS.}THE FORGE AT   
 LOOSLEY ROW WILL REPAIR FARM MACHINERY
 AND BRAZE AND WELD, WHILE THOSE       
 EMPLOYED IN THE FURNITURE TRADE CAN   
 OFTEN OBLIGE WITH RESTORATION. IN FACT
 THERE ARE NOT MANY HOUSEHOLD JOBS     
 WHICH CANNOT BE DEALT WITH BY LOCAL   
 TRADESMEN. INDEED, MORE UNUSUAL PROB- 
 LEMS CAN BE SOLVED. NOT FAR AWAY IS A 
{STAINED GLASS EXPERT}WHO RECENTLY RE- 
 STORED A WINDOW IN THE PARISH CHURCH.
