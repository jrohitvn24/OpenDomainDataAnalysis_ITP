		<content> As the area is mainly farmland, with  
 scattered villages, leisure activities
 are predominantly localised eg.village
{football}and{cricket}teams, and{darts 
 and{skittle}teams centred on village  
 pubs.This region is well known for its
 illuminated{carnival}processions in   
 late autumn;many communities have     
 their own carnival clubs, whose aims  
 are to raise funds for charities by   
 building floats to take part in the   
 processions.                          
 The village of Camerton held an annual
 steam{traction-engine rally}which was 
 very widely supported and attracted   
 steam enthusiasts from the whole of   
 the West Country and beyond.
