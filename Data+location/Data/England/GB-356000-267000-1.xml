    We went to see Mrs Hewitt and these
 are the  changes she told us.She has  
 lived in Tenbury Wells since 1925     
 and she has lived in that  very house 
 since 1940.When she was smaller she   
 remembered Bowketts Supermarket being 
 just a butchers and the car park being
 built in 1950.Cross Street has always 
 been the same and there were no       
 houses up Terrills Lane until 1934 and
 there was nothing by the Catholic     
 Church except a farm.Where there is   
 now an estate called Greenhill Close  
 there lived a man called Mr Godson and
 he lived in a house called The Court  
 in the twenties.Tenbury Hospital      
 also opened in the Twenties.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
