		<title>07DAIRY FARMING AT TYWARDREATH</title>
		<content> There are {fewer farms}in our area    
 than there were twenty years ago. This
 is because land around Tywardreath has
 been sold for {building sites}and     
 farms have also joined together. The  
 biggest farms are about 200 acres but 
 most farms are 100 acres or less. The 
 smaller ones are usually{dairy farms.}
 Dairy farming plays a large part in   
 the area.                             
 Channel Island cows used to be kept   
 for their creamy milk but they only   
 give 3 gallons daily. Nowadays people 
 are health conscious and prefer less  
 creamy milk so the farmers keep       
 Friesians which might give 5 gallons a
 day. {Milking}takes place twice a day 
 and the milk is stored in{refrigerated
{tanks}and collected daily by {tanker,}
 taken to the{factory at Lostwithiel}  
 and used for powdered milk.
