		<title>10A Day With Rebecca Aged 9</title>
		<content> I got up at 8.15am, washed, dressed   
 and had my breakfast. I went to school
 in the car with my Mum and Dad. I went
 into the classroom and took the packed
 lunches into the kitchen and then     
 turned the music on in the Hall ready 
 for Assembly. In Science we wrote     
 about our runner bean. During playtime
 I played chitty backs with Nicola.    
 After play we did Maths until 12.00am.
 After lunch we worked until 2.00 pm   
 and then went swimming in the school  
 pool. After school I walked home with 
 Nicola. I had my tea at 6.00pm and    
 after tea I played on the computer    
 with Daddy. Then I got ready for bed, 
 had a drink, cleaned my teeth and went
 to bed.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
