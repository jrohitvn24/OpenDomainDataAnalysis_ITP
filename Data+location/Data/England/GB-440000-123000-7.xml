		<title>07MR WILDE'S HOUSE,HURSLEY</title>
		<content>    A picture painted in 1919 by Mr.   
 Wilde was a beautiful river scene.    
 Outside the {Tudor chimneys }on Mr.   
 Wilde's house lean to the south.Some  
 of the patterns on the chimneys were  
 very unusual but some were more       
 common.                               
    Mr.Wilde has a car called a        
{Tempereno }(built 62 years ago) which 
 is one of the only ones still in      
 existance.When they were made there   
 were only eighty- four produced.The   
 yellow Tempereno looked very old      
 exactly like a"Nody car."The lights   
 were made of carbon.                  
    Mr.Wilde had many other{rare lamps 
 which looked very old-fashioned.He    
 kept these under his kitchen table.He 
 also valued his old sewing machine    
 which he kept upstairs.
