		<content>  We do lots of different things at    
 school, such as English,Mathematics,  
 Art and Craft, Drama, Games and       
 Computer Studies. There are also clubs
 after school where children can do    
 gymnastics, badminton, photography and
 computer programming. My favourite    
 subject is English and I particularly 
 enjoy writing stories.  In my spare   
 time I enjoy reading, playing football
 and riding my bicycle. I have just    
 passed my cycling proficiency test at 
 school and I received a certificate   
 and badge.We had to show an examiner  
 that we could ride a bicycle safely   
 and that we knew the Highway Code.

  Material for this survey was produced
 by several staff and numerous pupils  
 at the High School and by the class of
 Mr.D.Gowthorpe at the Junior School.  </content>
