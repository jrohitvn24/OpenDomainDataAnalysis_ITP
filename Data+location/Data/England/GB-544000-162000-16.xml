		<content>Although most families in this area own
a car (and indeed many families now    
have two cars) a lot of people commute 
to London.In this respect Orpington    
Station is very important.There is a   
regular service to Charing Cross and to
Victoria.For anyone wishing to cross   
the Channel,trains run to Dover.       
Chelsfield Station is a more convenient
starting place for people living in    
Green Street Green.The number of trains
actually stopping at Chelsfield has    
been reduced in recent years.          
Orpington Station is also a focal point
for the bus routes which bring people  
from the more rural areas.Other bus    
services connect this region to Bromley
and Lewisham.                          
There is considerable discussion at    
present about the possible             
privatisation of the bus routes in this
area.                                  </content>
