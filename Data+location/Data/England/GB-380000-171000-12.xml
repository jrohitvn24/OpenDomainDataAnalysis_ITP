		<title>12Nature Conservation</title>
		<content> The children of Colerne Primary School
 are very keen on Conservation in our  
 area. In 1982 one class dug out a     
 school pond in a waste ground area. We
 put a polythene lining in. The        
 polythene lining worked well for two  
 years, when it started to split.      
                                       
 Everyone in the school planted some   
 trees in the Conservation Area.They   
 included hazel, beech and oak. Quite a
 few of the trees survived. We also    
 planted some wild flowers and chose   
 ones to attract butterflies.          
                                       
 In the end of 1984 we cemented the    
 pond.We stood the water in buckets    
 over night and then in the morning we 
 emptied the water into the pond.We    
 drained the water out of the pond and 
 then filled it up again. The pond now 
 has a variety of pond creatures.      </content>
