		<content>   Most people who have visited{Brook  
 tell us that they enjoyed their visit 
 because of the{tranquility}of the     
 area. The{beach}is situated below     
 sandstone cliffs and the people who   
 visit Brook during the summer months  
 say how peaceful and{secluded}it is.  
 The beautiful country walks are       
 popular with the visiting tourists.   
 Many visitors pass through Brook on   
 the{Military Road}whilst touring the  
 island.The road itself proves to be a 
 tourist attraction and was built by   
 German prisoners during World War 2.  
  Along the side of the road there are 
 stone hats on top of fence posts as a 
 reminder of the captured soldiers. The
 picturesque village is also an        
 attraction to visitors with its{pretty
{green}and{bubbling brook.
