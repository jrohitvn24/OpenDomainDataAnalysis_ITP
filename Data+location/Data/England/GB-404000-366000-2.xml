The very first school that opened was  
the Â£Old Dame School'at Bank House.    
There were four or five children in    
this school. In 1873 the old barn next 
to the church was made into a school.  
November 10th,1873 there were only four
children.                              
Mrs.Gertie Mellor started school when  
she was six in 1911. She attended      
Hollinsclough School during World War  
1. When she was at school this great   
big box came,the teacher opened it, it 
was full of wool which was for knitting
for the soldiers. The young ones       
knitted scarves, bigger children       
knitted socks,then the next ones       
knitted gloves and the very big ones   
knitted baraclavers. Sometimes a boy or
girl would fall over in the lesson     
beacause they had not had enough to    
eat.                                   </content>
