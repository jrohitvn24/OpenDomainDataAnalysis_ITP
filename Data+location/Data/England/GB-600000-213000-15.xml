		<content> I talked to{Mr Mills}about Mersea     
 eighty years ago.I asked if there were
 any other play areas on Mersea apart  
 from the{Glebe.}Mr Mills said yes     
 there was a play area near the post   
 office.I asked Mr Mills if Mersea had 
 changed a lot.Mr Mills said only the  
 buildings had changed a lot in eighty 
 years. Then I asked Mr Mills if the   
 old mill used to have a shop outside  
 selling what ever they used to make.Mr
 Mills said yes but only for a litle   
 while.I asked if there was a water    
 fountain then or did you have to use a
 well.Mr Mills said he had to use a    
 well.
