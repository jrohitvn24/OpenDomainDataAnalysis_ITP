		<content>    Saturday is one of the most popular
days of the week.Most people go down to
the town with friends,if not they go   
out with their parents to large        
shopping centres like Brighton or      
Eastbourne.                            
    On Saturday night many people      
attend the Roller-Disco,costing 1.20p  
and lasting 1hr.45mins.Saturday night  
is also a good night for watching the  
T.V. Some favourite programmes are     
Dallas and Dynasty,which are soap      
operas.                                
    Not many young people find Sundays 
interesting because there aren't many  
programmes on the T.V.,and there are   
few shops open.                        
    So most people either visit places 
with their families, such as castles,  
National Trust properties or places of 
historic interest.Also they go to see  
their relatives and friends.           </content>
