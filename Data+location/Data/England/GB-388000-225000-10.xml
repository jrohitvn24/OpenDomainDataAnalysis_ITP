 Boddington Manor was in the original  
 Domesday Book. The Manor has been     
 restored by the present owners.Mr.    
 Robert Hitchen took over the manor in 
 1976,before him it was owned by a     
 priest called Cannon Grise Hutchinson 
 who died. Robert Hitchen gave his sons
 the business in 1976 and the manor    
 became the head offices of the R.H.G. 
 Nobody lives in the manor,but over 40 
 people work there.Around 200 builders 
 are employed by the firm. The company 
 builds houses and factories. The      
 houses are sold,but the factories are 
 rented. They build in Gloucester and  
 Chelford. There are industrial estates
 in Tewkesbury and New Queddgley. The  
 Robert Hitchins Group also has a large
 farm at Boddington (see page 9)
