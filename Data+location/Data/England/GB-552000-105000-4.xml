		<content> Cuckmere Community Bus service        
 commenced in 1976 with a bus provided 
 by East Sussex County Council. Now 2  
 buses operate from Berwick Station    
 serving villages in the Cuckmere area 
 on 3 days a week travelling to        
 Hailsham and Seaford over slightly    
 different routes on each day.         
 Representatives from the villages, the
 County Council and the Southdown Bus  
 Co. are on the organising committee.  
 Some of the original drivers are among
 the 20 volunteers all holding PSV     
 licences. Arlington and Berwick are   
 amongst the villages served, though   
 the service is available to any member
 of the public provided they are not   
 conveyed between 2 points on a        
 Southdown route. The service is almost
 self-supporting but small donations   
 are made annually by most of the      
 parish councils concerned.            </content>
