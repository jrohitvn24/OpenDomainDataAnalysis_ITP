		<content>    There is plenty of opportunity for 
{leisure time pursuits}and all the     
 family tend to take advantage of this.
 The older generation tend to spend    
 much of their leisure time at home    
 gardening, cooking or reading. The    
 youngsters enjoy swimming, jogging,   
 youth club and a whole variety of     
 sports. The more ambitious spend much 
 of their time doing homework aspiring 
 eventually to become a banker, nurse, 
 air hostess, computer programmer,     
 secretary, accountant or policeman.   
    Most families have their annual    
 holiday to look forward to,95% go away
 for at least one week each year and   
 the remaining 5% have weekend outings.
 Wales is a popular venue for{holidays 
 being our nearest coastal area, but   
 many travel further afield, usually to
 the coast. Only a small percentage    
 travel abroad for their holidays.     </content>
