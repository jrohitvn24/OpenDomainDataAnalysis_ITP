		<title>20The surveyors of this area</title>
		<content> We thought that it would be rather    
 nice to include as our last page some 
 information about ourselves and how we
 did this survey.                      
 We will have left our school by the   
 time you read this,and our school is  
 due to closed and moved to a new site 
 in September 1986.we really enjoyed   
 taking part in the survey;which we did
 by splitting into 12 small groups and 
 each group having parents to help     
 them.We made plenty of phone calls,and
 then visits to find out those things  
 which we have told you.               
 We hope that as the years pass you    
 will wonder a little about us,as we   
 have wondered about who will read     
 this,and for how long it will be seen 
 by people in the future.We enjoy      
 living in our area,and hope you will  
 too if you ever visit.
