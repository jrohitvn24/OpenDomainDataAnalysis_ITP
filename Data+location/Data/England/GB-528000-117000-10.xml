		<content>   Burgess Hill is a rapidly{expanding 
 town in West Sussex. The pattern of   
 employment is changing because of     
 industrial development and an increase
 in housing. In the past{farming}had an
 important place in the community and  
 many people were employed in          
 agriculture. The town then developed a
{brick and pottery industry.}Now people
 find employment on the{factory estate.
   Industry is light and varied, jobs  
 are in warehouses, factories and      
 manufacturing.Many people{commute}to  
 London, Brighton and Crawley.{Gatwick 
{Airport,}the second largest in Great  
 Britain, also provides employment for 
 many local residents.                 
   There are{low unemployment figures  
 in this area, compared with the       
 national average. Opportunities arise 
 locally for young people to take part 
 in the Youth Employment Scheme.       </content>
