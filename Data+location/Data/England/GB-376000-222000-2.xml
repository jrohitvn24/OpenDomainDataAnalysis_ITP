		<content> This area is of historical interest   
 illustrating life since Domesday. The 
 Church, dating from C11th, has Norman 
 arches, and a C14th tower and chancel.
 The C12th century Tithe Barn is one of
 the largest in Gloucestshire and its  
 roof was extensively renovated in     
 1982. To the south there was a        
 farmhouse, Abbot's Place, (part of the
 medieval Gloucester Abbey Estate)     
 which Hartpury Court replaced in      
 C18th. By the Court the former Roman  
 Catholic Chapel in the present barn is
 still detectable (used 1794-1837;     
 1930-1947) The owner of Hartpury Mill 
 has recently restored the water wheel,
 paddles and mill race. Today these are
 favourite subjects for local artists -
 of which there are three of note in   
 the village.
