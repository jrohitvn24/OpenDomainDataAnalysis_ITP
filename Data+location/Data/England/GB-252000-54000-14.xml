		<content>   Up to a late start at 10.30. Mum was
 trying an experiment downstairs of    
 scrambled egg done in the microwave. I
 then went out with my friend to the   
 park, and then to the shops to buy    
 some sweets. I came back much later   
 and had dinner. After Wimbledon we all
 went out onto Dartmoor.               
   Whilst on the moor we saw a heron   
 fishing in the river. Then we saw a   
 kestral on the rocks. We walked       
 through a bog on the way back and     
 found some cotton grass and some      
 bilberry.                             
   Then it was time to go home. At home
 we all had tea which was lasagne. At  
 10.00 o'clock I went upstairs to watch
 television, and went to sleep at      
 10.30.
