		<content>   Each year Kilsby Church holds its   
 major money raising ecevnt. It is held
 in Mr.Thomas' field. People bring     
 their horses and dogs from miles      
 around. There is a big beer and       
 refreshment tent. The horses can be in
 different competitions. There is a    
 jumping competition, a race weaving   
 around posts and competitions for the 
 best presented horse.                 
   The people of Kilsby set up a lot of
 different side shows. There are       
 skittles, throwing the sack of hay,   
 horse shoe on the spike and various   
 other stalls such as cakes and plants.
   The profits are usually in the      
 region of Â£1000 to Â£1500. This money  
 helps to run St.Faiths for another    
 year. Any extra income will go towards
 the church restoration fund. This year
 it rained but we still made a lot of  
 money.                                </content>
