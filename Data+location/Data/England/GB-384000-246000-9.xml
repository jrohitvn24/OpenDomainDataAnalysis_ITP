		<content>  There are a few other sources of     
 emplyment in the area.In Napleton     
 there is a small family haulage       
 firm.In Green Street,there is a small 
 riding stable.Baynhall has it's own   
 garage,and it was there that the      
 following interview was recorded.     
                                       
 BAYNHALL GARAGE                       
   When 3M went for the second time to 
 Kempsey,Stephen Warburton and I       
 interviewed the manager of Baynhall   
 Garage.The manager is fifty three     
 years old,married and has two         
 children.He very much enjoys living in
 Kempsey,and the easy access this gives
 him to the large shops in             
 Worcester.His pastime is his job      
 because he very much enjoys it but    
 does not have time for a true         
 hobby.His wife also works at the      
 garage.                               </content>
