		<title>01Introduction to Seagry.</title>
		<content> In this part of Wiltshire the land is 
 very undulating.There are two main    
 woods,Bincombe Wood in Rodbourne and  
 Seagry Wood in Upper Seagry.We have   
 three farms in Upper Seagry and       
 Startley.In Rodbourne Bottom there is 
 a children's home called Cleve House  
 which over looks a railway bridge.The 
 river Avon flows through Lower Seagry 
 and that is where the old Mill stood. 
 In Upper Seagry we have a house called
 Seagry House which is very big and has
 a lovely garden.Seagry has a lot of   
 big houses such as the Mount and Seals
 Court.Just past the School we have a  
 Council house estate called Broad     
 Leaze, and if you take the road to    
 Lower Seagry you will find the old    
 School house.The land around here has 
 alot of woodland and is quite marshy  
 also the farmland is mainly dairy and 
 arable.                               </content>
