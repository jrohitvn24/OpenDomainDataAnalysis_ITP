		<title>01The Pennines - Eastern Slope</title>
		<content> The Grouse Moors to the E of          
 Midderdale in N Yorkshire slope down  
 &amp; change to marginal sheep &amp; cattle   
 grazing land in the direction of the  
 York Plain. The block typifies this   
 gradual change in terrain. Several    
 typical Yorkshire stone farms can be  
 seen. Dry stone walls &amp; hedgerows are 
 in abundance. Fields are small. Gills 
 (small steep-sided water course       
 ravines) are lined with both deciduous
 &amp; coniferous woodland. Sheep flocks &amp; 
 cattle are frequently seen. Grouse can
 be seen &amp; heard inhabiting the moors &amp;
 margins. Grouse shooting butts exist. 
 There is currently no land under      
 cultivation (arable). Roads, though   
 narrow in places, are well maintained 
 &amp; are all of tar macadam surface. Milk
 is collected by road tanker. Overhead 
 electricity cables carry supplies to  
 the farms.                            </content>
