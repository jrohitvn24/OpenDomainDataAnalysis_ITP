		<content>    Employment prospects for people in 
 our are are not good, with about 20%  
 being out of work. Consiquently, many 
 families have to have finacial help   
 and many children in our schools have 
 to receive free meals. People have to 
 travel quite long distances out of    
 Thanet to their places of work, and it
 is not unusual for people to work 20  
 miles away.                           
    The is no heavy industry in our    
 area,only small-scale light industrial
 units, such as the ink manufacturing  
 company near-by.                      
    (Any more ???)
