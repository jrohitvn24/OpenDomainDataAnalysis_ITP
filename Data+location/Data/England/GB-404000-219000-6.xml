		<title>06FARMING IN SALPERTON</title>
		<content> Salperton Park was once a manor with  
 the home farm and a small amount of   
 land attached.The present estate farms
 640 hectares in a square block.The    
 farm manager's office is in what was  
 once the home farm yard.It is a       
 traditional Cotswold mixed farming    
 estate with a 160 Friesian Dairy      
 Unit,500 breeding ewes,and 400        
 hectares used for cereal growing and  
 break crops(usually rape).There is    
 also an extensive shoot.              
 The fields are enclosed with well     
 maintained fencing,dry stone walls and
 hedges.There are coppices of both     
 deciduous and coniferous trees, some  
 recently planted,and many single trees
 in the fields,providing  shelter for  
 the animals.
