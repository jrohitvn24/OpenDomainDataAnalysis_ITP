The area contains the villages of      
Barton-under-Needwood and Dunstall.The 
land is mainly flat,mixed farming and  
woodland and is part of the Trent      
Valley.Dunstall is however small and   
hilly and is contained in an estate    
run by Sir Robert Douglas.It has its   
own church and Cricket Club but no     
shops or schools.Most residents use    
the amenities to be found in Barton or 
Burton.Barton is the main residential  
part in the area and in the past       
twenty years has grown from a small    
quiet village to a large busy one.It   
has a very attractive appearance and   
in the 1950's and early 60's regularly 
won the Best Kept Village Competition  
in Staffordshire.The approximate number
of residents is 5000 and for a village 
of this size has a good variety of     
organisations and amenities.           </content>
