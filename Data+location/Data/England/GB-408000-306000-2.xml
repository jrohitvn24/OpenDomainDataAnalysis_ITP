		<title>02GEOGRAPHY : THE WALL AREA.</title>
		<content>  The area is on the eastern side of   
the South Staffordshire plateau and    
lies within a few kilometers of        
Lichfield whilst the Birmingham and    
Black Country conurbation is a little  
further afield.                        
  Geologically the district consists of
a mixture of Bunter sandstones and     
clays with some glacial drift and these
have favoured agriculture. Relatively  
fertile soil and proximity to urban    
centres plus freely available water    
held in the Bunter sandstone and gravel
beds have resulted in an emphasis on   
intensive market gardening and cereal  
production. The water is extracted     
for use in irrigation via boreholes and
submersible pumps. There is some dairy 
farming.                               
  The land, which is undulating has no 
major drainage but the main flow to the
north is to the Trent system.          </content>
