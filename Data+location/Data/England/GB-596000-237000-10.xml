  The village shop closed for trading  
in about 1974,it used to be housed in  
Waterloo House at the bottom of the    
hill.The shop was run for a time after 
that but was sold as just a house in   
1978 .Mrs Lowe was granted a Post      
Office licence and ran the Post Office 
from a council bungalow in Rockalls    
Road,it was later transferred to a     
converted garage nearby.The shop was   
lost completely until March 1984 when  
the Polstead Community Shop was opened 
in the farm field entrance between the 
village hall and the old school        
house,sold in 1982,and now known as"The
Master's Lodge".The shop is open on    
four days a week and stocks a          
comprehensive selection of groceries   
useful items,and fresh local produce.A 
large rota of local volunteers take    
turns at the shop counter.             </content>
