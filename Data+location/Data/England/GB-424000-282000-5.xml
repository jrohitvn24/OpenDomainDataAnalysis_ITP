		<content> Meriden lies in Green Belt land       
 between Coventry and Birmingham, and  
 the area represents a buffer between  
 these rapidly expanding urban areas.  
                                       
 The village lies in the centre of a   
 beautiful tract of typical            
 Warwickshire countryside of           
 fields,ponds and woodland. The high   
 ground which surrounds the village on 
 the north and south sides gives       
 extensive views of the surrounding    
 countryside, so the area is very      
 popular with walkers and ramblers and 
 there are many waymarked footpaths.   
                                       
 The countryside is full of a great    
 variety of wildlife, both animal and  
 plant variety.
