		<content>  Lt.Gaddesden and Ringshall is        
 generally open farming. The farmers   
 mostly put cattle on fields. The      
 commonest cows are Friesans and       
 Herefords;they cross breed            
 sometimes.They are bred for beef not  
 so much dairy products. Crops are seen
 everywhere. These include Oats,       
 Barley, Wheat and also Oil seed       
 rape.Some farmers breed pheasants and 
 they let them go and shoot them. We   
 have no grouse in this area.Some      
 farmers have turkeys or chickens. Some
 of them have little farms.The amount  
 of acreage starts at about 25         
 acres,the medium size farm is 15O     
 acres,the farms have up to 6OO acres. 
 Farmers are using modern implemts not 
 the old machinery. Modern machinery   
 does the job better and faster.And    
 large tractors are for the large      
 fields                                </content>
