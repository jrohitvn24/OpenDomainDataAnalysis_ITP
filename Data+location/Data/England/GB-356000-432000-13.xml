		<title>13Grimsargh Field Day</title>
		<content>Grimsargh Field Day is an annual event 
Saturday 29th June was Grimsargh Field 
day. I was going to take part in the   
fancy dress with some other friends.We 
were going to go as the Grimsargh      
Gruesomes but we changed it to         
Frankinsteins wedding.                 
We all felt silly walking around in    
the funny costumes.The judges took a   
long look at us .                      
                                       
Then we joined the procession and      
walked around the village.             
When we reached the park the rose queen
was crowned.Then the winners of the    
fancy dress was announced. First they  
announced the singles and then the     
group. The judge said that             
Frankensteins wedding had won. We all  
gave a big cheer.
