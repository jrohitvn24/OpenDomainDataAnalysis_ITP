		<title>13LINFORD MANOR, MILTON KEYNES</title>
		<content> Great Linford Manor which is situated 
 in Parklands through which the Grand  
 Union Canal passes was built in 1678  
 by Sir William Pritchard who bought   
 the land from the Napier family. He   
 pulled down the older medieval manor  
 and put up the centre block of the    
 present building. The principle       
 stonemason was George Kemp of Great   
 Linford. In 1972 Great Linford Manor  
 was bought by Milton Keynes           
 Development Corporation to be an arts 
 centre where it was used for various  
 activities such as pottery, sculpting,
 painting, weaving, concerts and drama 
 classes. Two barns were renovated and 
 used for crafts. The old almshouses   
 are still used by individual          
 independent craftsmen for             
 picture-framing, jewelry making an    
 pottery. In 1984 M.K.D.C. withdrew    
 their grant and the manor closed.     </content>
