		<title>17CAMPING WITH CUBS</title>
		<content>  One of my interests is belonging to  
 Cubs.I belong to the Leigh Sinton pack
 because this is the nearest one.On the
 weekend of the 22nd.and 23rd.June I   
 went to camp at Eastnor Park,just     
 outside Ledbury.                      
  The leaders and our parents pitched  
 the tents. When they were up we went  
 inside to put our clothes and sleeping
 bags away.There were five of us in our
 tent.After tea I helped with the      
 washing up and then went to bed,      
 because it was 9:30pm.                
  On Saturday morning I helped to cook 
 breakfast.We had sausages,bacon and   
 fried bread.After breakfast we tidied 
 our tents for inspection.After        
 inspection we did a survival course on
 the camp-site.We made a shelter from  
 dead branches and ferns,a mask and a  
 small fire.                           
                                       </content>
