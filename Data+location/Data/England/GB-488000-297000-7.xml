		<content>    Two twelve year old boys           
 interviewed Mr. Peter D'Arcy, the     
 landlord of "The Gate Inn" at         
 Bisbrooke. This is what they found    
 out:                                  
                                       
    Mr D'Arcy is about 50 years old,   
 and has lived in the village for 15   
 years. He is married, and he and his  
 wife live in a small cottage across   
 the road from the pub. He has a blue  
 Volvo Estate car, and reads the "Daily
 Express" and "Daily Mirror"           
 newspapers. He goes shopping in Oakham
 and Uppingham, and goes to resorts on 
 the south and east coasts for his     
 holidays. The furthest he has ever    
 travelled is to Jersey.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
