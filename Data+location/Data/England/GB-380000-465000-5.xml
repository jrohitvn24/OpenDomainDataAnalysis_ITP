		<title>05RECREATION IN STAINFORTH (1)</title>
		<content> Since Stainforth is in the middle of  
 the Dales, and quite a long way away  
 from any large town, there isn't much 
 in the way of recreation. Many people 
 spend their time in outdoor pursuits  
 such as shooting or fishing, or       
 swimming and skin-diving in Stainforth
 Force in the summer, but there are    
 some indoor ones as well. Knight      
 Stainforth caravan site provides      
 activities such as pool, table-tennis 
 and the odd video game. This is mostly
 for younger people. The Craven Heifer 
  in the centre of Stainforth provides 
 pool and darts for older people. The  
 vicar of Stainforth, with the help of 
 a number of other churchgoers, runs a 
 youth club known as 'Teenage Time'.   
 This meets every few weeks or so in   
 members' houses in the surrounding    
 villages of Langcliffe and            
 Horton-in-Ribblesdale.                </content>
