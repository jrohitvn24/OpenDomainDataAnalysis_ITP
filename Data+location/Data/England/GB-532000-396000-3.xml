   These are owned now by Mr.&amp;         
 Mrs.A.Muckslow,who have just taken    
 over from the Harrison family who     
 started the stables 5 years ago.It is 
 called{"Four Acres Riding School"}but 
 is also used as a small caravan site  
 for club members.People come from all 
 over to stay there and ride horses.   
  There are about 32 horses or ponies  
 for which people pay approximately Â£3 
 per hour.In the summer holiday periods
 many visitors,both adult and children,
 come for a riding holiday and stay in 
 the bunk-house.                       
  The indoor school,which has sand all 
 over the floor,is very good because   
 when you fall off you won't hurt your 
 self.It also helps to keep the lessons
 going in bad weather.Quite a few      
 children from our school use "Four    
 Acres" in their spare time.           </content>
