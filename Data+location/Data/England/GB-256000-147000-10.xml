		<title>10Local Farming and Fishing</title>
		<content>      Most of the local farms are on   
 rough grassland and are used for      
 grazing sheep &amp; beef cattle.  One     
 local farmer has a dairy herd.        
      At one time strawberries were    
 grown here on a commercial basis but  
 to day they are only grown in private 
 gardens or allotments.  There are a   
 few small market gardens but most of  
 the food is imported.                 
                                       
      In former times there were many  
 fishing boats in the harbour.  The two
 remaining to day are mainly used for  
 gathering crabs and lobsters and      
 taking out fishing parties in the     
 season, when they mainly catch        
 mackerel &amp; pollock.  A few folk who   
 don't mind wading up to their waists  
 in cold water gather prawns from the  
 rocky headlands at low tide.
