		<title>17POPULATION CHANGES</title>
		<content> An irreversible change has come to    
 this once agricultural area, except in
 Wisley, which apart from one or two   
 farms is the Royal Horticultural      
 Society's village. There are farms    
 scattered throughout, but most of the 
 district has undergone a transform-   
 ation to commuter country. Families   
 are smaller. People move on as work   
 takes them elsewhere. There is little 
 unemployment. Adolescents are usually 
 at day schools or later at University.
 In Wisley the small population is     
 based on the Royal Horticultural      
 Society. On retirement people         
 frequently move to a less expensive   
 area.
