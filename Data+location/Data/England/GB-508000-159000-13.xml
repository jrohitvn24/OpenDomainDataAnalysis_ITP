		<title>13DAY CENTRE - COBHAM SURREY</title>
		<content> There are about 21,000 old people in  
 Elmbridge.                            
                                       
 Mrs Harrington of Age Concern said    
 that the day centre is a place where  
 elderly people meet, play snooker,    
 knit and attend organised classes. On 
 average 70 attend daily. It's closed  
 at the weekend. Wednesday is          
 wheelchair day. If old people do not  
 live in the flats a bus will collect  
 them. Outings are arranged such as    
 visiting parks or houses. A day centre
 lunch costs 80p. They make about 400  
 "Meals-on-Wheels" a year.             
                                       
 The warden, a cook and 2              
 "washer-uppers" get paid, the rest are
 voluntary workers.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
