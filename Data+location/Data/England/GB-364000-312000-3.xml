		<title>03Hadley Park Lock</title>
		<content> Hadley Park Lock was used for little  
 boats which carried{coal.}It was built
 about 200 years ago but it is not used
 anymore.All the gates  are rotting and
 also there is not enough water for the
 boats.The lock has three gates and    
 over the top were big winches for     
 pulling up the gates. While we were   
 there we met an old man who said he   
 could remember the boats going up and 
 down the canal.The canal was last used
 in 1944.                              
                                       
{G.K.N. Sankeys}is a factory situated  
 to the north of Hadley centre.It      
 covers a large area of land.The       
 factory makes army vehicles like tanks
 and trucks and spare parts for these  
 vehicles.G.K.N.Sankeys employs a lot  
 of people between the ages of 25 and  
 65 years.
