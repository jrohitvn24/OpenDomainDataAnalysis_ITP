		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content> THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA IS      
 FAIRLY FLAT, LOW-LYING FARMLAND       
 DRAINED BY THE RIVER YEO, WHICH FLOWS 
 FROM BLAGDON LAKE TO THE SEVERN       
 ESTUARY. THE NORTHERN PART OF THE AREA
 IS MORE HILLY AND LARGELY COVERED BY  
 MIXED WOODLAND.                       
 THE TWO MAIN SETTLEMENTS ARE          
 CONGRESBURY AND WRINGTON. BOTH HAVE   
 BASIC AMENITIES SUCH AS SHOPS, PUBS,  
 GARAGES, CHURCHES AND PRIMARY SCHOOLS.
 THERE ARE ALSO TWO LINEAR HAMLETS,    
 IWOOD AND UDLEY.                      
 THE ONLY MAIN ROAD IN THE BLOCK IS THE
 A370 THROUGH CONGRESBURY, RUNNING     
 BETWEEN BRISTOL AND WESTON-SUPER-MARE.
 TODAY THERE IS NO RAILWAY. BRISTOL    
 LULSGATE AIRPORT IS TO THE NORTH AND  
 PLANES CAN OFTEN BE SEEN OR HEARD IN  
 THE WRINGTON AREA.                    
 CADBURY HILL FORT AND WRINGTON CHURCH 
 ARE PLACES OF HISTORICAL INTEREST.    </content>
