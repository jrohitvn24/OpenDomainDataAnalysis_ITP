		<content> People in our area spend their        
 holidays in different places.Many     
 people go{abroad}by plane. They go    
 for the sunshine.Others{stay at home  
 and most go to the seaside.Some go    
 to the Lake District,Scotland and     
 Wales for the scenery and they go on  
 walks,hikes or drive round.They  go on
 holiday by  car  and some take a      
 caravan to stay in .They dont always  
 go to the same resort euery year      
 because they want to try out new      
 resorts. Most people go on holiday in 
 the summer and will stay in one of    
 these places a static caravan, motor  
 home, rented house, flat, tent or     
 hotel. However most people in our area
 are{farmers}and they dont get chance  
 to go on holiday in summer because the
 farmer is busy milking, haymaking and 
 silaging. If they do get a holiday it 
 is at a less busy time of the year.   </content>
