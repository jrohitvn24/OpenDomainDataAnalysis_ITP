<title>21Update on Box Factory Site (October 2011)</title>
<content>

The factory mentioned in the original article was vacated in the late 1990s and the company (now known as DS Smith Plc) moved to larger premises 5 miles away on the edge of the village of Fordham. A large majority of the factory was demolished, and housing was built on the site in the early/mid 2000s. Some warehouses are still standing, however there have recently been attempts to sell the land for residential development.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ownership of the sports field next to the factory site was passed on to Burwell Parish Council and it continues to be used as the village's community cricket ground. From very early on plans were in place to refurbish the former social club - which had been left empty after the vacation of the factory site - as a community centre, however in 2007 a large fire destroyed much of the building and left the remaining parts structuraly unsafe. In 2011 it was rebuilt and extended, finally opening as a community centre in the October of that year.   &lt;br />
