		<title>08MY DOG, JENNY FOX</title>
		<content>  My dog is very good for training. She
 does as she is told. She is good for  
 her age. She is only a puppy and is   
 six months old. Her name is Jenny Fox.
 My family is called Fox.              
         {House training               
 She is very good in the house. She    
 does not go to the toilet in the house
 but does play around with the cats.   
         {Safety training              
  We have taught Jenny not to cross the
 road until she has sat down at the    
 kerb. Now when we take her to the     
 field she sits at the kerb straight   
 away.                                 
        { Other training               
  We have taught Jenny to fetch the    
 ball and give the ball. She is very   
 good at doing things when she is told.
{         Behaviour                    
 Jenny is very good. But she does chew 
 a lot of things.                      </content>
