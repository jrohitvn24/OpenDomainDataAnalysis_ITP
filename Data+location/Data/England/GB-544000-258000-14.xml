		<title>14CAMBRIDGE FAIRS</title>
		<content> THERE ARE VARIOUS FAIRS THAT COME TO  
 CAMBRIDGE.  MY FAVOURITE IS THE       
 MIDSUMMER FAIR.  IT COMES TO CAMBRIDGE
 IN LATE JUNE AND IT HAS MANY EXCITING 
 RIDES.  MY FAVOURITE RIDE IS THE BIG  
 WHEEL.  THE STRAWBERRY FAIR IS A FAIR 
 WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME WITH THEIR OWN  
 PRODUCTS AND SELL THEM.  THERE IS A   
 LOT OF GOOD FUN THERE.  AT NIGHT      
 THERE IS A ROCK CONCERT WHICH IS      
 USUALLY VERY GOOD.  GOING OFF THE     
 SUBJECT OF FAIRS, I WANT TO WRITE     
 ABOUT THE FIREWORK DISPLAY.  ON GUY   
 FAWKES DAY THE COUNCIL HOLD A MASSIVE 
 FIREWORK DISPLAY.  I THINK IT'S MUCH  
 BETTER THAN HAVING ONE AT A HOUSE.    
 AFTER THE FIREWORK DISPLAY THEY HAVE A
 BIG BONFIRE WITH A GUY ON TOP.  I     
 THINK THAT CAMBRIDGE IS THE BEST TOWN 
 FOR ACTIVITIES.
