From June to August haymaking is the   
main activity.                         
                                       
In August and September the farmer is  
taking his second crop of silage.      
                                       
By September the cows are being brought
in at night again.                     
                                       
In October, fertilizer is sown on the  
hay fields to help them grow the next  
year.  The hay is given to the cows    
which are now in at all times.         
                                       
In November and December the farmer can
relax, only feeding and looking after  
the animals, although this, in itself, 
is a big job.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
