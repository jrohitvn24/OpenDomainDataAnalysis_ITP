		<content> Owlswick is a pretty little hamlet    
 of about a dozen scattered houses and 
 thirty inhabitants.   There are two   
 places to meet, one on either side of 
 the green, the Shoulder of Mutton     
 Motel and the Chapel.  A no-through   
 road leads down to a landscape        
 gardening business.  Owlswick is      
 reached on foot by a bridle way off   
 the A4129 at the Thame end of Longwick
 and an unclassified road from the     
 centre of Longwick.   One of the farms
 near Owlswick has its own shop where  
 home produced pig-meat of all kinds   
 can be bought.  Also near here are the
 permanent quarters for Pettigroves    
 Fair.  The caravans are parked in the 
 fields over the winter while the fair 
 machinery is overhauled and the       
 families rest.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
