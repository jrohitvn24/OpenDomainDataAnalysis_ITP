		<content> Southminster is served by 34 retail   
{shops}with 21 different types of      
 businesses. There are three small     
{supermarkets}which have increased     
 their trade over the last three years.
 The shopkeepers obtain their{supplies 
 from a wide area of England, the      
 furthest being{Darlington}which is    
 some 275 miles away. Many use large   
 warehouses in{London}and collect their
 own goods.                            
 There is a{Farm Shop}which sells      
 home-grown vegetables and locally     
 grown apples pears and soft fruit.    
{Younger family shoppers}tend to travel
 once a week, fortnight or month to a  
 large{supermarket}12 miles away at    
 South{Woodham Ferrers}to do their     
 shopping.{The Senior Citizens}use the 
 local shops and shop more frequently. 
 Once a week shoppers are bussed in    
 from outlying areas.                  </content>
