		<title>20PEOPLE WHO DID THE SURVEY</title>
		<content> Two schools were involved in gaining  
 the information in this particular    
 block.They were Brookside County      
 Primary Scool,East Leake and Lantern  
 Lane Primary School,East Leake.       
 A fourth year junior class was used in
 each school.                          
 Groups of children were formed and the
 survey was done as part of the normal 
 educational process.                  
 One aspect which was particularly     
 rewarding was the opportunity which   
 the survey gave for the two schools to
 liaise whilst doing the work.
