		<content>Most of the Buildings in our block are 
residential dwellings, there are two   
schools and a few commerial            
premises.The houses vary greatly in age
size and style.One house is three      
hundred years old but the majority are 
between one hundred years to twenty    
years old.There is only one very       
recently built area, the houses are    
only two years old.Most of the houses  
are brick built,red or brown brick,a   
few are wooden and only a couple are   
thatched.There are many large detatched
houses with four or more bedrooms.Most 
is private housing with three areas of 
council housing.One of the largest     
buildings is Elvendon priory,a private 
house which on rare occasions opens to 
the public
