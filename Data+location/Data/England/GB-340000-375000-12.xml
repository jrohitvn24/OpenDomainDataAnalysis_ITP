		<content> Children from this area attend one of 
 four primary schools, tranfering to a 
 comprehensive school at eleven.       
 Children from the Wolverham area      
 attend Stanney Comprehensive School,  
 and children from the Westminster area
 attend Grange Comprehensive School.   
 However, this is certain to change in 
 the near future. Grange Comprehensive 
 will admit pupils for the last time in
 September 1985. Catchment areas for   
 the other comprehensive schools will  
 then be re_drawn.                     
 This is in line with the policy of the
 Cheshire County Council, and reflects 
 the fall in the birth rate in the town
 over the last 10 years.               
 Pupils from the Weatminster area will 
 have a longer daily journey to school 
 in future years.
