		<title>14The Spa</title>
		<content> The Spa is a complex of buildings that
 includes a theatre, concert/conference
 hall, exhibition halls, bars, cafe and
 cloakrooms. The whole structure is    
 undergoing a programme of             
{modernisation}and{redecoration}in     
 order to improve the facilities and   
 attract more{conferences}to the town. 
 The Spa is situated on the southern   
 half of Scarborough's South Bay and   
 has a pleasant view across the bay    
 towards the old town and harbour.     
 There has been an improvement in      
 parking facilities and access to      
 hotels on the South Cliff above the   
 Spa is easy via the Cliff Lift. The   
 discovery of a Medicinal Spa on this  
 site in the 17th century was the      
 original attraction to Scarborough as 
 a resort. This aspect of the Spa is   
 totally neglected today and the spring
 issuing from the sea wall is ignored. </content>
