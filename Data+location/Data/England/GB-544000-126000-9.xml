		<content> We went down a muddy bridleway behind 
 the Duddleswell Tearooms. It was steep
 in some parts and we slipped. At the  
 bottom there was a shallow stream. We 
 walked through it though there was a  
 bridge; then we saw some rare flowers 
 called 'Spotted Orchids'. A while     
 after that we saw two cottages named  
 'Brown's Brook' and 'Primrose Patch'. 
 We found a little patch with charcoal 
 in it and then there was another      
 stream. We jumped over it because it  
 had quicksand at the bottom and it was
 deeper than it looked. We saw birch,  
 willow and lots of sapling oaks. There
 was a fair amount of broom and        
 bracken. We went back a different way 
 and that was muddy too. Then we went  
 back in the mini-bus passing Oldlands 
 Hall.
