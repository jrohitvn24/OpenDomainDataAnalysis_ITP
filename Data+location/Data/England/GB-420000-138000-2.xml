		<content>{Mr Wagg owns Boscombe post office}and 
 was{very nice,}and when I asked him   
 the questions he seemed quite happy   
 answering them. {The shop is very busy
{with passing trade.}People come from  
 all walks of life. He has got food    
 which is perishable. {Mrs Aubrey was  
{the lady in Newton Tony post office.} 
 She was very nice and was fairly busy 
 and  if food goes  off she either     
 throws it away or gives it to the     
 birds. She keeps her food fresh with  
 freezers and fridges. {She sells      
{sweets, seeds, comics, crisps, ice    
{creams, Dairy Produce and Groceries.} 
 We asked the children in our block if 
 they used the village shops and they  
 did, mainly to buy sweets. The        
 children do most of their shopping in 
 Salisbury.
