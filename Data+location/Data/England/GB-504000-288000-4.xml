		<title>04OUNDLE AS A SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content> Oundle has quite a few small shops.In 
 fact for a town of its size it is well
 served.Many of the shops are family   
 businesses.There are no multiple chain
 stores here.The range of shops is very
 good.Local residents can buy clothes, 
 food,newspapers or a television. The  
 town has an exceptional bookshop,which
 is owned by the public school.There is
 also a large music shop,which is      
 unusual in a town of this size.       
  These shops are used by the local    
 residents and by the many nearby      
 villages,most of which have no shops  
 at all.Oundle grew up as a market     
 town.A small but popular market still 
 takes place each Thursday,but there is
 no cattle market.This takes place in  
 Thrapston.Despite the scope offered   
 by the local shops however many go    
 to the bigger towns.The Queensgate    
 Centre in Peterborough is popular.    </content>
