 The majority of people interviewed in 
 Rottingdean were retired and expressed
 a reactionary attitude towards change.
 They felt that there was a community  
 atmosphere and did not wish to develop
 their village, only to preserve the   
 existing environment. This country was
 characterised by the caring attitude  
 freedom of speech, mums out shopping, 
 and changeable weather. They valued   
 England for its patriotic atmosphere, 
 democratic voting and legal system,   
 Sunday closing and its Royal Family.  
 They feared that many of these aspects
 of Britain might be left behind with  
 increasing unemployment, violence and 
 crime. Children should be learning    
 values of self discipline and         
 respect.                              </content>
