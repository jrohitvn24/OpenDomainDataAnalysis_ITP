		<content> After milking the parlour is hosed    
 down and the equipment is washed      
 automatically.                        
                                       
 After breakfast there are various     
 routine jobs to be done. For          
 example,scraping up the collecting    
 yard, checking over the milking       
 machine, mending fences etc.          
 Occasionally representatives call and 
 take up half an hour or so trying to  
 sell something new. The tractors and  
 machinery also have to be serviced and
 kept in good repair.                  
                                       
 Three times during the summer we make 
 silage for the cows to eat in winter. 
 First of all this involves waiting for
 fine weather. The grass must be cut,  
 picked up by machine and blown into   
 trailers. (continued)
