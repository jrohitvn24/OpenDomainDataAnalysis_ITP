		<content> We talked to Colin Slough the{VICAR}of
 Christ Church and St John's Church in 
 Sandown about{RELIGION.} He enjoys    
 being a vicar because every day is    
 different.  Today he brought the      
 children to school and then dictated  
 some letters and then took a service  
 at{CHURCH.} Afterwards he popped into 
 the mothers club.  Tomorrow could be  
 totally different.  Some days he likes
 his job and some days he doesn't.     
 Sometimes he works from 7a.m. to      
 11a.m.  If someone isn't well they go 
 to him.  He has two churches and in   
 the Winter he gets 60 to 70 people on 
 Sundays.  In the Summer he gets lots  
 of extras.  He has to think of both   
 churches the same amount.  At St.     
 John's Church he needs thousands of   
 pounds to spend on the{BUILDING.}
