		<title>13THE GRAVEL PITS, HILTON</title>
		<content> This 75acre site was used for gravel  
 extraction until 1945. The area was   
 bought by the Derbyshire Naturalist   
 Trust in 1972 and developed as a      
 nature reserve. It is now a valued    
 village amenity,used by the local     
 schools for field study work and      
 visited by other members of the Trust.
 The five pits flooded and gradually   
 the areas around them naturalised,    
 first as reed swamp, scrub then       
 woodland.                             
 Trees include willow, birch, scots -  
 pine, oak and the rare black poplar.  
 There are 280 plant species, including
 three kinds of orchids, - marsh,      
 twayblade and spotted. Birds include  
 warblers, grebes, mallard, coot,      
 Canada geese, woodpeckers, field fare 
 and red wings. 18 butterfly species   
 and 150 different moths have also been
 identified.                           </content>
