		<content> In the last century the area around   
{St. Day}was known as the{richest      
{square mile}in the{westen world       
 because of the{copper mines.}However, 
 by the end of the century all the     
 mines were waste and desolate because 
 copper had been discovered in{Africa. 
 The mines were left and the country   
 was covered with mine waste.In 1981   
 the County Council decided to reclaim 
 it.They thought of farming but the    
{arsenic}and{copper}in the ground would
{poison}the land.It was decided to plan
  trees for enjoyment.{68,000 trees    
 were planted including:sycamore,alder 
 ash,oak,pine and hawthorn .They       
 planted them about 1.5m apart so they 
 would be well  protected from the     
 wind.They employed twenty people on   
 a Manpower service scheme.They fenced 
 the area to prevent{vandalism}from    
 people and{destruction}by rabbits.    </content>
