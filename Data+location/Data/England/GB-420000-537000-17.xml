		<content> Mr.Drenon has lived in Brandon all    
 his life and became interested in     
 local government because he wanted to 
 help the area he lived in.Each day he 
 attends meetings in County Hall,      
 Durham, headquarters of the County    
 Council. He reads his post,takes his  
 messages and investigates any queries 
 left for him. He enjoys all aspects of
 meeting and helping the people of     
 Brandon and would like to bring more  
 jobs to the area. He is very  pleased 
 that the new sports centre is nearly  
 completed, but thinks Brandon could   
 still do with more shops. some days   
 there are not enough hors for him to  
 do all his work, but he would not move
 from the area, he is dedicated to     
 help.
