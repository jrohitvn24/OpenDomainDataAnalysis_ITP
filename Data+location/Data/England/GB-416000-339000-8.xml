		<title>08RABBIT FARMING</title>
		<content>    My rabbits are kept in separate    
 hutches. In summer they eat dandelions
 and bread, and have hay for bedding.  
 In winter they eat Quaker oats and    
 have straw for bedding. I feed them   
 morning and night and clean them out  
 once a week unless the doe has babies 
 when I might harm them.               
    When the doe and the buck are      
 mating they are kept together for a   
 month. then the buck is taken out in  
 case he eats the babies. The doe has a
 batch of about sixteen babies.        
    I keep one kind of rabbit called   
 New Zealand white. These are worth    
 more. I breed them for pets. I go to  
 market once a year when the rabbits   
 are six or seven months old. We get up
 to Â£5 for one or up to Â£35 for a doe  
 and a buck.
