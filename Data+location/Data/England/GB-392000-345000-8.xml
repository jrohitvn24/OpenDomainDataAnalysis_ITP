		<title>08ASH HALL-Werrington</title>
		<content>Ash Hall was built in the early 19th   
Century,about 1837.It is a gothic style
building and it had an extension built 
on the side during the Second World    
War.In the past hundred years or so the
hall has had a variety of uses         
including:- hotel,hospital,country club
and residence.                         
  The hall is now rented by the N.C.B.,
and it is used as offices.             
  Somewhere in the house is supposed to
be a secret passage leading to the     
public house across the road.There is  
also said to be a ghost that roams the 
hall.It is said to be the spirit of a  
former resident called Geoffrey Wood.  
  From the entrance hall,on a clear day
,the whole of the Potteries can be     
seen.                                  
  The whole estate covers between 4-5  
acres,and includes it's own bowling    
green.                                 </content>
