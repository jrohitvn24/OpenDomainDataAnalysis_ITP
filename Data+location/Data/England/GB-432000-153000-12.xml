		<title>12What life is like in Tangley</title>
		<content>  The farm land around Tangley is clay 
 and chalk. There are a lot of crops   
 grown in Tangley e.g. wheat, barley,  
 oats and maize. Tangley is on top of a
 hill, there is a lot of wind and in   
 winter I get snowed in for days at a  
 time. I live at Whistler's Farm on the
 top of a ridge. Whistler's Farm can be
 a wild and wind swept place. When I   
 ride my bike it is down hill all from 
 my house and uphill all the way back  
 to my house.                          
  The roads are narrow and windy.      
  There is some woodland around my     
 house. There are alot of sheep in the 
 fields and some cattle. In the winter 
 there is hunting and shooting. Where I
 live some of the summers are hot and  
 some of the summers are wet. There is 
 a coach service to take me to school.
