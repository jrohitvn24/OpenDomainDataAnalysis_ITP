		<title>13LEE MOOR AREA-TOURISM.</title>
		<content> Lee Moor village has little to do with
 tourism at the moment.Although the    
 village is on the edge of Dartmoor    
 there are no guest houses,hotels,     
 public houses,or tourist attractions. 
 However,it is an area which attracts  
 people on day trips,either walking on 
 the moor (mainly Penn Beacon),pony    
 trekking from Tinpark Farm,or having  
 picnics in the Newpark Wood area.There
 is a bridleway for walkers or ponies  
 which goes from Tolchmoor Gate to the 
 south-west corner of the grid,another 
 one which goes from Quick Bridge to   
 the bottom of the grid,as well as     
 other footpaths in the Headon China   
 Clay Works area.When china clay       
 extraction has finished it could be   
 that the whole area will be made into 
 a country park,catering for public    
 recreational use.
