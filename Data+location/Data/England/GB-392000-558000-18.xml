		<title>18A Vegetarian Family of four</title>
		<content> It is interesting to find that even in
 a country area like ours,more and more
 people are becoming{vegetarians-}that 
 is, not eating meat and fish.We began 
 by eating less and less meat and      
 getting more and more enjoyment from  
 eating-and cooking- vegetarian food.  
 Eventually two of us cut meat out of  
 our diet altogether. We did this for  
{2 main reasons}. Firstly,we did not   
 like the idea of eating animals,and   
 secondly, we feel lighter and         
 healthier.{Shopping}is no problem     
 because we grow our own vegetables,and
 local health shops sell everything    
 else we need.{Cooking}is fun,because  
 there are so many different foods,    
 herbs and spices which make delicious 
 meals.A{typical}meal would be: eggless
 mushroom quiche, home-grown potatoes  
 and salad, bean salad, home-made      
 yogurt and fruit. Delicious! J.Casson </content>
