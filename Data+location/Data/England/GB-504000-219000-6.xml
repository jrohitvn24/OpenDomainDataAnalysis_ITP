		<title>06FARMING MEDIA BURY FARM</title>
		<content>Our class 1RI went in the mini-bus to  
Bury Farm Caddington owned by Mr       
Mossman. There are about 30 horses and 
a number of carriages which are used   
for films, videos, weddings, funerals  
and special events. The farm is for    
storing and looking after the animals, 
carriages, coaches and horse drawn     
buses. The fields are for grazing and  
hay making. There are about 8 cattle on
the farm to keep down the grass.       
We met two minature horses called Mork 
and Mindy, another had been in a video 
for Frankie goes to Hollywood and a    
film called Little Lord Fauntleroy.    
Many of the horses were away from the  
farm making the film Revolution.       
There was a Royal Mail coach and an old
bus. In the old days the ladies would  
sit downstairs because the stairs were 
very narrow and ladies dresses were    
wide.                                  </content>
