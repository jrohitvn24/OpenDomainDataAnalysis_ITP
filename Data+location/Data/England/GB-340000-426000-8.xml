		<content> Club Day, an annual event in each     
 village, is held in Warton on the     
 first weekend in June and in          
 Freckleton on the third weekend in    
 June. Club Day is divided into two    
 parts, the first being the procession 
 through the streets of the village and
 the second the Fair and childrens'    
 races. The procession is the oldest   
 part of Club Day and was originally   
 organised by the 'Friendly Societies' 
 or 'Clubs' as the members knew them.  
 These Clubs looked after the welfare  
 of their members during hard times. To
 attract new members to the Clubs each 
 would hold an annual procession       
 through the streets to publicise the  
 benefits of membership. After the walk
 refreshments were provided for members
 and their families. The visit of the  
 Fair on these occasions also goes back
 many years.                           </content>
