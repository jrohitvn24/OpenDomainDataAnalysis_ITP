{stadium.}League matches are played    
 there,and the {Muratti,}the annual    
 match between {Jersey}and {Guernsey } 
 is held there every other year.       
 Originally built for cattle shows, the
 Stadium was used as a first aid centre
 during the war and a car crushing     
 plant. Now, apart from football, the  
 stadium is used for cattle and dog    
 shows, darts competitions and {Bingo.}
{The Caesarean Croquet and Lawn Tennis 
{Club.}In spite of the club's long     
 name,you can no longer play croquet   
 nor can you play tennis on grass. The 
 croquet lawns have been turned into a 
 car-park and there are seven{shale    
{courts }and 3 grey-green courts. A new
 club house was built on the 5th of    
 September 1980 to replace an old      
 shed. Caesarean is {Latin }for Jersey 
 which has given the club its name.    </content>
