		<content>                                       
 The area's communications are not very
 good.The village of Horton contains a 
 Post Office just in the edge of our   
 square.The Post Office occupies one   
 room of a large modern house.It only  
 opens in the morning.                 
       There are two telephone boxes in
 our square ,one is in Horton and the  
 other is at Little Sodbury End.Most   
 houses have their own telephones.     
 There are a number of Post boxes      
 through out the area and collecting   
 times are twice daily execpt Sundays  
 Delivery of post is by Royal Mail van 
 every week-day mornings.There are no  
 newspaper deliveries- these have to be
 collected from Chipping Sodbury by the
 residents.
