		<title>20ROLLE COLLEGE, EXMOUTH</title>
		<content> Rolle College was opened in 1946.The  
 numbers of students have increased    
 since it was opened.At first the      
 college only took women.In 1967 it    
 started to take male students.There   
 are 850 students attending the        
 college, 650 are taking Bachelor of   
 Education Degrees and the other 200   
 are taking Bachelor of Arts Degrees.  
 To become a student at the college a  
 minimum of 2 'A' levels and 4 'O'     
 levels are needed,including Maths and 
 English.The facilities at Rolle       
 include Resource Centres,School       
 Classrooms,Laboratories, Computer     
 Room, Library, Gymnasium, Music Room  
 with a computer that writes music and 
 a synthesiser, college bar and gardens
 where students can relax. I think     
 Rolle College is very good for        
 students because they have good       
 facilities for work and relaxation.   </content>
