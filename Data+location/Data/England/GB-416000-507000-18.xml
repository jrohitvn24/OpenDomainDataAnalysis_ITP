		<title>18EAST LAYTON-Village &amp; Church</title>
		<content>    The village has no shop,  the house
 which was the  shop/post office is now
 a  private  house.    A number  of new
 detached   stone  built  houses   were
 erected some seven years ago and apart
 from  one or two  conversions  of  old
 stone barns in the area, these and the
 Council built houses  at the  East end
 of the village  represent the only new
 developments this century.            
   Reference is made in{Bulmers History
{&amp; Directory of North Yorkshire 1890}to
{"The old hall of the Laytons,a curious
{and quaint old house,  with the family
{arms above the door  is now an inn" -}
 any traveller  must now  either quench
 his thirst at the  Social Club  or  at
 one of the many inns a few miles away.
    The{church was built}between{1893 &amp;
{1895}by {R. Dodds &amp; Sons} of{Melsonby.
 This {replaced } the  {chapel-of-ease}
 "formerly used by the dissenters."    </content>
