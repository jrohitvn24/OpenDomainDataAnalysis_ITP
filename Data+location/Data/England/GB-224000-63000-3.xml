		<content> Churches play a central role in the   
 community life of Liskeard and the    
 nearby villages and small towns.All   
 local denominations took part in the  
 BBC's 'Songs of Praise'(to be shown   
 1986).There are 3 predominate places  
 of worship,with extensive parishes.   
{St.Martin's(CoE)}is the 3rd largest   
 church in Cornwall and dates from     
 Norman times.The main{Wesley Chapel}  
 was opened in July 1846 and can seat  
 over 900 but now has a community roll 
 of 540.(Wesley visited the Liskeard   
 area several times).The Catholic      
 church,{Our Lady and St. Neot},was    
 built in 1863  of local granite and   
 slate with seating for 150.It has     
 fine statues of St.Neot.

 chapels of the immediate district are 
 places of worship for{Jehovah
