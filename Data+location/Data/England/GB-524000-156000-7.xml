		<content>  The main line of transport is the    
 railway that goes west to Tattenham   
 Corner near the Epsom race course and 
 east to Purley, where it is possible  
 to change to trains going to Victoria 
 station in London. The two stations   
 called Kingswood and Chipstead are    
 used by young people quite frequently.
 Adults are struck by the beauty of the
 line which travels on an embankment in
 Chipstead Valley and plunges into a   
 deep leafy cutting after it leaves    
 Chipstead station.The crossing        
 of Outwood Lane is made on a viaduct  
 which dominates the landscape there.  
  The most useful bus is the 166 which 
 travels from S. of Woodmansterne to   
 Croydon, which is a major shopping    
 centre. Those who can reach Banstead  
 may use the 164 to Sutton, those able 
 to reach Coulsdon have the 405, 414 to
 Croydon.                              </content>
