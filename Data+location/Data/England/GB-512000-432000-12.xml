   Longhill Primary School was built in
 1954. It is made of brick,concrete    
 panels and glass, and has flat roofs. 
 When it opened the youngest children  
 at the school were 5 years old and the
 oldest were 11.                       
                                       
   In February 1957 the school had the 
 most children it had ever had-793.    
 There were 17 teachers and a head     
 teacher. The smallest class was taught
 by a part-time teacher and had 26     
 children, but the other classes had   
 between 42 and 52 children.           
                                       
   In 1985 the youngest children attend
 the nursery which was started in 1978 
 in a converted block of 4 classrooms. 
 They are three years old.
