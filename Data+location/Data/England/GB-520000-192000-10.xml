 Wentworth Hall had been a private     
 mansion.During the war it became a    
 home for refugees and later a hotel,  
 then it was pulled down and modern    
 town houses replaced it.St.Vincent's  
 Convent was once one of King Charles  
 the Second's many homes.We were told

 leading from the house to the gazeebo.
 Here,we were assured, Nell Gwyn often 
 stayed;later the gazeebo was called   
 the Temple.

 it is reputed to have sheltered Dick  
 Turpin,the highwayman.
