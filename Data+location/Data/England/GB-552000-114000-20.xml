		<title>20Local News</title>
		<content> Residents receive their news in       
 several ways. A chat over the counter 
 of the village stores, or the bar of  
 one of the pubs; the Parish Magazine  
 reaches most homes with its news of   
 church matters and local societies;   
 the Sussex Express and the Courier are
 the local newspapers and Radio Sussex 
 is the local radio station.           
 A newsworthy item in recent months has
 been the Village Bypass, which it is  
 hoped will be built from Park Corner  
 to Halland crossroads. This will leave
 East Hoathly free of through traffic  
 on the A22 and should improve village 
 life.                                 
 Three routes were shown to the public 
 and a questionnaire was distributed to
 all houses in the vacinity. The "Blue 
 Route" which is the longest, was      
 chosen as the most suitable.          
 A bypass was first discussed in 1931. </content>
