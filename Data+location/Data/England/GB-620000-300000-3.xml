		<content> Swainsthorpe covers 2000 acres of land
 and the population is around 350. Most
 of the people are in the younger      
 generation because of the new houses  
 that have been built. There are only a
 few school children in the village.   
 Most people have jobs in Norwich      
 except the farmworkers and some people
 who make furniture in the village.    
 There are hardly any shops or         
 amenities in the village. The one shop
 is run by the garage. It sells        
 necessary products. There are no clubs
 for chilkdren in the village, but for 
 the adults there are bowls, darts, and
 the Ladies Open Door Club.            
 There is one famous person associated 
 with the village* Sir Alfred Munnings 
 the amous artist.
