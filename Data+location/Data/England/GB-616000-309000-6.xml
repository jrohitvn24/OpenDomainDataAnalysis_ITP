 Nowadays, many people do not go to    
 church except for special occasions.  
 However, there are several thriving   
 churches in Costessey.  In the        
 village, there is St Edmunds, the     
 Anglican Parish Church, and a Baptist 
 Chapel, both on The Street.  As Lord  
 Stafford's family, the Jerninghams,   
 were Catholics, the village has a     
 Catholic tradition, and a fair-sized  
 church, St Walstans.  On Norwich Road,
 there is a modern Methodist chapel, in
 New Costessey, and a modern Anglican  
 church, St Helens, on Gurney Road.  We
 finish off with Hebron Hall, a        
 non-denominational chapel, on Sunny   
 Grove, and a congregation which meets 
 in Breckland Hall, on Gurney Road.
