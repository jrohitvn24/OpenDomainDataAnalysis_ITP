		<title>12The Gas Line</title>
		<content> Running west-east through the block is
 a major gas supply pipe. For most of  
 its length it is buried below the     
 fields. It crosses the Great Ouse     
 above ground on its own bridge of     
 steel girders.                        
                                       
 The pipe is part of the national grid 
 of high-pressure gas drawn from North 
 Sea platform rigs. It is currently    
 being enlarged, and the above-ground  
 sections are thoroughly painted and   
 inspected annually.                   
                                       
 Despite the proximity of the pipe to  
 the village, there is no gas supply   
 available to any of the villagers. It 
 seems that a small plant to convert it
 to normal pressure would not be       
 economic.
