		<content> This ferry only operates between the  
 hours of 08.30 and 17.45,carrying     
 passengers towork,holidaymakers       
 sightseeing,and day shoppers to       
 Falmouth for goods they cannot buy in 
 their own area.Unfortunately on days  
 when the weather is very bad the ferry
 does not operate and this can cause   
 problems for regular passengers on    
 theit way to work,forcing them to make
 other arrangements,causing            
 inconvenience and a much longer costly
 journey.{
