		<title>05VISIT TO A STOKE DOYLE FARM</title>
		<content>    We set off straight away after     
 assembly at 9.30 a.m.,all thirty of us
 and Mr.Williams to walk along the     
 narrow country road to Stoke Doyle. We
 got there at 10.25, just in time to   
 visit the farm which was called Seven 
 Wells. We met the farmer who was      
 called Mr.Knight with his dog called  
 Toby. To show us around his farm he   
 took us on his trailer on which we sat
 on bales of hay. He took us past the  
 fields up the track, past the         
 sugar-beet field and the sheep-dip and
 past the manure pile until we came to 
 his biggest field which had three     
 different crops in it. From there we  
 could look all over the farm and do   
 the work on land-use in four squares  
 on the map by just looking from this  
 one place! Then we saw the dog catch a
 rabbit he found in a small copse of   
 trees recently planted by Mr.Knight.  </content>
