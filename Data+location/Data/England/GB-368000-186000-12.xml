		<content>{There is a garage}in this area. It is 
 in Bagstone. This sells petrol and    
 diesel oil, services and repairs      
 vehicles and is a base for a fleet of 
 lorries. The garage is run by a staff 
 of 3 people and there are also 15     
 lorry drivers.                        
{The lorries}carry stone and gravel.   
 They travel to Tytherington Quarry,   
 Swindon, Bristol, Cheltenham and      
 Gloucester. The journeys they make are
 always within 100 miles. Out of the 15
 lorries, 1 lorry is a 4 wheeler and   
 weighs 16 tons, 7 lorries are 6       
 wheelers and weigh 24 tons and 7      
 lorries are 8 wheelers and weigh 30   
 tons.                                 
{When asked about the changes}that were
 taking place in the business, the     
 proprietor said that there were more  
 and more lorries on the roads and they
 were getting bigger and heavier.      </content>
