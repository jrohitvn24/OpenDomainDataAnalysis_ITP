		<content>  This is an area of undulating        
 escarpment,generally over 230m above  
 sea level where it overlooks the      
 valley of the River Corve and         
 tributary, Pye Brook, at about 115m.  
 The latter takes most of the drainage,
 to the north andwest in Clee Brook and
 Strand brook in valleys over 75m deep.
 The ridge is traversed by minor road, 
 whichkeeps to highr ground on South   
 East line, this is maintained when it 
 divides into two. One lane runs along 
 the side of the shallow valley at a   
 height of about 120m. Nowhere is there
 a connection between 2 routes by way  
 of the scarp face. the lanes are      
 bordered by substantial hedges,       
 generally. There are three groups of  
 council type timber houses set        
 conspicuously at the roadside,        
 with elsewhere, dispersed farms,      
 cottages and few modern houses.       </content>
