		<content>      I live at 82 Waddington Road in  
 Accrington.  My sister has a job at a 
 newspaper called the Weekly Herald and
 she is a{type setter.}My other sister 
 has just left college and is applying 
 for a job.  I am still at school - it 
 is called Peel Park.  This year is my 
 last year at this school. Next year I 
 am going to Hollins School in         
 Baxenden.  I have two cats, a guinea  
 pig and a fish.  The guinea pig does  
 not live at my house - it lives at Oak
 Hill park and it is called Toffee.  I 
 won my goldfish at a fair - it is     
 called Bubbles and my two cats are    
 called Tat and Sooty.
