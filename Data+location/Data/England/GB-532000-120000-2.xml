		<title>02Wivelsfield - Social Concern</title>
		<content> One of the principal causes for       
 concern recently has been a proposal  
 to change the County Boundary between 
 East and West Sussex. At a meeting    
 held in the Village Hall the majority 
 voted to remain in East Sussex.       
                                       
 In World's End, a home for the elderly
 provides sheltered accomodation       
 arranged as 15 flats with a resident  
 warden. The residents have social     
 evenings and can do their own shopping
 at the local shops. Each of the rooms 
 in the flats has a bell which will    
 summon assistance if required. The    
 residents also have the use of a      
 communal laundry room.                
                                       
 A doctor's surgery is held once a week
 in Wivelsfield Village Hall.This is of
 great help to the elderly and those   
 unable to travel to the nearby towns. </content>
