		<title>04Adisham Tourists and Ecology</title>
		<content>  Adisham contains a few cottages which
are let to tourists in summer. The     
Public House attracts people from out- 
side the area and there are passing    
visitors. They like the quiet and      
lovely footpath walks available through
the Downs. The village is not beautiful
but there at least four medieval houses
and the l3th Century Church. Ancient   
woodland fringes Water Tower Woods,    
but a quarter has been destroyed by    
coniferous high forest. The remainder  
are ancient modified beech coppice     
woods, inhabited by foxes, game birds, 
woodpeckers, nightingales, and tree    
creepers among others. Some hedges and 
lines of trees still remain on the     
lower slopes. Orchids grow in more     
remote parts, some wild flowers are    
left, and butterflies, mainly cabbage  
white. The village pond is now a green 
and frogs try to live in garden ponds. </content>
