 1.These results show the importance of
 the antique centre to Battlesbridge , 
 attracting 86% of all visitors.The    
 effect of the new road would not seem 
 to have reduced the pull of the       
 antique centre.The nursery has much   
 competition,47 people came from Essex,
 2 from Kent and 1 from Hertford.8 came
 from Southend,6 each from Wickford &amp;  
 Battlesbridge and 5 each from Leigh &amp; 
 Hullbridge.This shows that the village
 and antique centre is well known in E.
 Essex and its attraction is also felt 
 outside the county.                   </content>
