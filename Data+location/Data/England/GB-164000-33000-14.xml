		<content> In{1945}there was still one shop.     
 This was a grocer's shop. The water   
 still came from the{natural spring }  
 at Bolankan. There was still a        
 blacksmith working in the village.    
 Most of the people worked at Holman   
 Foundry, Camborne, the Mill in        
 Crowan and on the farms. There were   
 lots of farms, some grew crops and    
 some had animals. The village was     
 the same size but some houses had     
 been{modernised.}The school in Praze  
 was about the same size as it is      
 today. People got their milk in a     
 can from the farm. There was still    
 no electricity in the houses and      
 people cooked on cornish ranges. The  
 most popular vehicle was now{the car.}
 The only tin mine still working was   
 Grenvilles at Troon. The modern day   
 bus firm is named after this mine.
