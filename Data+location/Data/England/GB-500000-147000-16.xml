		<title>16Royal Grammar School, G'ford</title>
		<content> In 1552 King Edward VI ordered that   
 there was to be a "grammar school     
 in Guildford for the education,       
 institution and instruction of boys   
 and youths in grammar at all future   
 times for ever to endure". The school 
 now consists of two main buildings on 
 opposite sides of the High Street. The
 new building was built in 1962.       
                                       
 The old building has a chained library
 dating from 1648 containing old and   
 valuable books. They originally       
 belonged to Bishop Parkhurst. They are
 chained because the library was once  
 open to the public and did not have a 
 librarian.                            
                                       
 The school is noted for its sport,    
 especially cricket and rugby. The     
 rugby team toured New Zealand in 1985.
