		<content>   From a distance,the slopes of the   
 North Downs may appear to be dotted   
 with white.A closer look may reveal   
 the white dots to be moving.They are  
 of course sheep.Here on the steep     
 slopes,it is not possible to          
 cultivate the land using machinery.   
   On the less steep slopes the sheep  
 have had to give way to more intensive
 farming,fields of barley having taken 
 their place.                          
   Although some sheep are to be found 
 in fields below the slopes of the     
 downs,it is more likely that there    
 will be barley,wheat,peas,or oil-seed 
 rape.From the top of the downs the    
 spring-time view is interrupted by the
 bright yellow of the blooming oil-seed
 rape.                                 
   Some cattle are kept,and for these  
 are fields of grass to be cut for use 
 as silage in the winter.              </content>
