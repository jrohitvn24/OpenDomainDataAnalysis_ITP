		<title>01An Overview of The Block</title>
		<content>  In the northeast corner of the block 
 is the village of Colwall(pop. c.2000)
 and most of the remaining area is     
 farmland, with crop growing the main  
 activity.The most significant feature 
 is the Malvern Hills which provide a  
 magnificent backdrop for the area.The 
 soil is largely composed of clay.     
 The most famous village resident was  
 probably the poet William Langland, a 
 contempory of Chaucer, and when he sat
 on the hills and wrote about 'a fair  
 field full of folk' he was referring  
 to his native village. Colwall's name 
 is probably derived from 'cool well'. 
 The village contains the only two     
 industries of this block -the bottling
 of Malvern Water - and a plastics     
 factory.The village occupants consist 
 largely of those who commute to the   
 cities of Worcester,Birmingham, and   
 Coventry, and many retired people.    </content>
