		<title>02A DAY AT CRANWELL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Every morning I cycle to school with  
 my friend Kristel. We arrive at 8.50, 
 and go inside when the bell rings. We 
 have assembly in the school hall.     
 Sometimes we have a story, or a padre 
 comes in. After assembly we have P.E. 
 for half an hour, we then have a      
 mental arithmetic test, then it is    
 playtime. During playtime we often    
 play elastics, there is a song we sing
 "England Ireland Scotland Wales inside
 outside inside on."   After playtime  
 we do maths and English until dinner. 
 When it is dinner we have another     
 playtime, and we play tig. We have    
 dinner at 12.30pm, after dinner we do 
 clay till 2.45pm. Finally we have a   
 story, our present one is, "Danny the 
 Champion of the World", we then put   
 our chairs up. Kristel and I get our  
 coats, walk to our bikes, and ride    
 home.                                 </content>
