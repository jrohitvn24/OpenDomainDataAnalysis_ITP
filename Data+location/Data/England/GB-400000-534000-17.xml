		<content> Many local dishes are common to North 
 of England and Scotland.              
{Breakfast.} Tea/coffee, bacon and egg,
 toast with marmalade, jam or honey.   
 Fruit.                                
{Main meal}-generally in evening except
 for farmers and retired.  Fast food is
 popular with working mothers, and     
 curry and spaghetti are more common.  
 A roast is still eaten on Sundays with
 Yorkshire pudding, turkey at          
 Christmas, and ham and pease pudding  
 with beetroot at showtime.  Other     
 dishes are rabbit pie, leek puddings, 
 tatie cake and fish.                  
{Lunch}is often a 'bait' of sandwiches 
 or pies.                              
 Teacakes, scones, cakes and fruit pies
 are all made regularly, and jam and   
 chutney.  Mince pies are a must at    
 Christmas, and dyed or 'pace' eggs at 
 Easter.  Wines are also made at home. </content>
