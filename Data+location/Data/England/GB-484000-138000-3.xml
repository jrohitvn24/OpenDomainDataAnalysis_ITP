 Frensham Big Pond is a main attraction
 because of its many kinds of          
 nature.There is a sandy beach around  
 the pond and people usually go there  
 to play,and sit on the sand,or go     
 paddling or swimming in the pond.You  
 need to take care because the pond can
 go very deep and weedy in places.     
 People from London frequently         
 visit the pond to relax.The area round
 the pond has been made into a country 
 park,and there is a car park,a        
 ranger's office and a Red Cross Post  
 there.There is an interesting walk    
 round the pond;sometimes you see rare 
 birds or their nests,and many         
 different types of wild               
 flowers,butterflies,and other         
 insects.Some people do windsurfing or 
 yachting on the pond.There is a hotel 
 on the far side of the pond.          </content>
