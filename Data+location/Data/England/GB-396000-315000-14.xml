		<content>   In the days of William I, foresters 
upheld the forest laws. Today Staffs.  
Police use mounted patrols and have on 
trial scramble bikes. Both are well    
suited to easy movement over the rough 
heathland and forest tracks.           
    We interviewed two mounted         
policemen who told us about their      
horses and their work.                 
    A horse is bought for about 1500   
pounds when 3 years old and training   
takes 12 to 18 months. It will work    
until it is 18 to 20 years old. The    
rider has a basic 9 week training      
course. When on duty, the rider is     
responsible for feeding and grooming   
the horse. The value of horse patrols  
is that a horse can move quickly and   
quietly. The riders have special       
uniforms but they did tell us that     
their hands and feet got cold in       
winter!                                </content>
