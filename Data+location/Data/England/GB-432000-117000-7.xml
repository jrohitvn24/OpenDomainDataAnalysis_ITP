		<content>  650 dairy cattle are kept on         
 Broadlands Farm.They are mainly       
 Friesian cows.Each cow produces 550 l 
 of milk a year,therefore every year   
 all the cattle together produce 3.5   
 million litres.The cows are milked at 
 5 different dairy units situated all  
 over the farm.Milk is sold to the Milk
 Marketing Board.                      
  The cows graze on natural &amp; improved 
 pasture near the river Test. Peas and 
 feed wheat are also fed the stock,and 
 in winter they are kept inside.Calves 
 are raised in 2 young stock units.No  
 beef cattle are reared commercially   
 but a few bulls are kept for the owner
  The farm includes woodland which has 
 much wildlife in it,such as deer,foxes
 squirrels,badgers,hedgehogs,birds and 
 butterflies.A gamekeeper looks after  
 the wildlife &amp; hedgerows are preserved
 for it.                               </content>
