		<title>05LINSTOCK CASTLE FARM</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mr and Mrs Wannop who  
 own Linstock Castle Farm and two      
 others in the area.The 'Castle' is a  
 Norman  fortified farm ,built to keep 
 out border raiders and original a     
 priory founded by Henry 1 in 1123.It  
 is well preserved and still lived in  
 today.The Wannops have 600 cattle each
 year 300 calves are born and 200 of   
 these are sold in Carlisle cattle     
 market for meat.500 acres are kept    
 for cereal crops (300 wheat, 200      
 barley.)The farm complex (3 farms)    
 support 8 families,with 14            
 employed.About 1000 sheep are bought  
 in and fattened up'during  the summer 
 ,when the grass is rich .Mr Wannop has
 a highly mechanised farm but does not 
 believe in destroying hedgerows or    
 using to much fertiliser or pest      
 spray.Deer are allowed to roam through
 Mr.Wannop's woodland plantations.     </content>
