		<title>05THE GREAT EGG RACE</title>
		<content>   Class 4B made some model cars for an
 egg race.Some people made their models
 out of Lego while some used pieces of 
 guttering and wood.Someone even made  
 one out of a pencil box.There were two
 egg races.One was a motorised race and
 the other a pushing race.Dean Moss and
 Clifford won the motorised race.Marc  
 Jackson and Melvin won the pushing    
 race.                                 
   Our cars had to travel a certain    
 distance and had to carry an egg.Some 
 cars stopped in the middle of the race
 and another car's motor blew at the   
 beginning of the race.My car came last
 in the race and I won a consolation   
 prize of a creme-egg.some people made 
 a vehicle but didn't enter the        
 competition.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
