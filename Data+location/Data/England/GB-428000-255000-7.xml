		<content>{N.B.The majority of Wellesbourne,     
{including the old village,is sited out
{of this D-block.    }                 
 Formerly a small village grouped      
 around the church, Wellesbourne is now
 a sprawling, dormitory housing estate 
 with few facilities. The portion that 
 falls within this D-block is made up  
 of 1930's Council houses and late     
 1960's _ early 1970's private housing.
 There is a small,thriving shopping    
 precinct with Post Office, a chemist, 
 a greengrocer, a small supermarket,a  
 DIY shop,a Chinese Take-away,a        
 children's clothes shop and a bank.   
 These shops are used for convenience  
 shopping the bulk being done in nearby
 towns.                                
 There is a small lending library.     
 The only Doctor's Surgery and Clinic  
 in the area is situated near the shops
 and library.                          </content>
