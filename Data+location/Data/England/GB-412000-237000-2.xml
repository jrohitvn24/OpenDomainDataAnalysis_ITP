		<content> Winter wheat is still used as the     
 first cereal crop sometimes being     
 planted after potatoes, more usually  
 after a grass ley. Winter barley then 
 follows for one or two years. This    
 gives a good entry to oil seed rape   
 production. Spring barley would then  
 be sown after a brassica crop to bring
 the land back into cereal cropping.   
   There are many sheep in the area,the
 main bulk of which are crossbred ewes 
 for producing fat lambs i.e.Border    
 /Leicester, Welsh/Scotch Mules. The   
 rams tend to be of the lowland type   
 Suffolk or Texel.Lambing begins in mid
 January until March. Early lambs are  
 sold fat on the open market the bulk  
 are sold at specialist lamb sales. A  
 small proportion are overwintered on  
 catch crops of roots and sold late    
 winter. Two flocks are wintered on    
 sprout stems and cabbage residues.    </content>
