Charles Wicksteed opened the park in   
1920 for the Kettering people.Today it 
covers a vast area of 140 acres and    
employs 250 staff.Most of the local    
people visit quite often and people    
come from places like Yorkshire and    
London on day trips.About 1500 coaches 
and 1,150,000 people visit each year.  
Entrance and the car park are free     
and the free playground is the largest 
in Europe e.g.44 swings,15 slides,13   
climbing frames,8 rounderbouts,2       
see-saws, all made by Wicksteed        
Engineering Co. in Kettering.It also   
costs nothing to walk around the lake, 
try the nature trail or watch the      
peacocks.There is plenty of space for  
everyone to picnic or play their  own  
games on the grass. A first aid station
is always open in case of minor        
accidents.                             </content>
