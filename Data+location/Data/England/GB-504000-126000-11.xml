		<title>11CRICKET IN WIS. GREEN</title>
		<content> Each weekend in summer cricket is     
 played on the village green.The       
 village has two men's teams and a     
 junior team.                          
    There are eleven men in each       
 team.Before the match they decide     
 who's batting and who's fielding. The 
 scorer sets out the batting and       
 bowling order. If a person is out,    
 they put what time out, how out, how  
 many runs and who bowled.             
    When the batsman hits a four, the  
 umpire moves his arm across his chest 
 and if he hits a six, the umpire puts 
 both of his hands in the air. For a   
 leg bye he hits his leg, for a wide he
 puts his arm out and for a no-ball he 
 puts one arm in the air.              
    The object of the game is to score 
 as many runs as possible.
