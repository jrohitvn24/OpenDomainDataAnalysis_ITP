		<content>  There are many sections to the Craft 
 Centre. In most cases the items for   
 sale are actually made on the         
 premises. In one section customers may
 choose a pearl or pearls and have a   
 piece of jewellery made. Elsewhere    
 leather goods are made; belts with    
 their own embossing being popular with
 the children. Jewellery from wire and 
 enamelled copper is made in the       
 third section. A lady makes stained   
 glass ware in the shape of butterflies
 and various insects or stained glass  
 pictures. She has pieces of coloured  
 glass which she puts together with    
 strips of copper soldering the edges  
 to hold them together. Four people are
 engaged in glass blowing, making a    
 variety of animal shapes, glasses and 
 vases. All the items made in the      
 various sections are for sale.
