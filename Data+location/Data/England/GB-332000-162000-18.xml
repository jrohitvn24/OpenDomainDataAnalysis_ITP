 My first school was Hillside.It was   
 quite a  small school with four to    
 eight year olds. One of the teachers  
 taught recorders and guitar .And they 
 have pigeons in the roof .The hall was
 an old barn.The hall is used for T.V. 
 dinner and gym.                       
 ST.MARTIN'S                           
 The school we go to now is called  St.
 Martins. The headteacher's name is Mr 
 Gilbert. We only take eight to eleven 
 year olds. We have a separate         
 television room as well.We have got a 
 heated swimming pool and a big        
 playground.We have a separate hall    
 from the gym.The main subjects are    
 Maths, English, project, R.E, journal,
 Catchwords, Handwriting, S.R.A.
