		<title>11Daily Life - An Engineer</title>
		<content>  Many working people travel away from 
Edingale to work.This example is of a  
man who goes to Birmingham(21 miles).He
gets up at 7.30-8.0. He has no         
breakfast but drinks a cup of coffee.It
takes three-quarters of an hour to get 
to work. When he gets to work he visits
everyone checking that they are O.K. If
there are any jobs to quote he does    
them in the morning. Then he sees      
customers, goes to the welders,        
but not on Thursdays, when he goes to  
the bank for the wages.He also checks  
the drawings and makes sure that the   
men are always busy. It is essential   
that he checks that all the parts are  
there and nothing is missing. He orders
from a German company called HASCO and 
then he again makes sure the men are   
working.INTERUPTION! A rush job comes  
in.
