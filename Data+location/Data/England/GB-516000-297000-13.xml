		<content>{ Peterborough District Hospital}is an 
 acute complex of 850 beds. The main   
 block was completed in 1968 and most  
 acutely ill patients are treated here.
 There are six main operating theatres.
 The large outpatient and accident dep-
 artments are adjacent, together with  
 most diagnostic and treatment depart- 
 ments like X-ray, Pathology &amp; Physio- 
 therapy. The following units are on   
 the West Site of the complex. Fenland 
 House (1981) deals with geriatric     
 patients. The Maternity Unit (1970)   
 has beds for GP &amp; Consultant patients 
 and a Special Care Baby Unit. The     
 Psychiatric department has beds in St.
 Johns (upgraded in 1983 for the       
 elderly mentally ill), Conolly House  
 (1975) and the Gables (both acute     
 psychiatry), and a day unit at the    
 Pines. There are also child and adol- 
 escent psychiatric units.             </content>
