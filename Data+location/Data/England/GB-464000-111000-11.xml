		<title>11Housing In The Denmead Area.</title>
		<content>  Although Denmead, as a village, has  
 existed for many centuries it has only
 begun to grow very recently. Most of  
 Denmead has been built since 1945,    
 much since 1970, and Denmead is still 
 growing with new housing developments 
 on the south side of the village.     
  Similarly, all of the part of Wecock 
 that falls into our area has been     
 built since 1965. It will not be long 
 before the "Green Belt" between       
 Denmead and Wecock is built upon.     
  Most of the housing in this area is  
 high-class, owner-occupied with 7     
 rooms or more in each house. With the 
 high rate of construction in Denmead  
 the number of people who have just    
 moved into the area is now up to 11%. 
  No new houses can be built in Wecock 
 as there is no land available that    
 would, at this time, get planning     
 permission.                           </content>
