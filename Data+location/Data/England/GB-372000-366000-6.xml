		<content>     Cranage has always had major roads
 linking it with other towns. The A50  
 used to be the main link to the south 
 and north to Manchester whilst the A54
 was the main Chester Buxton road. With
 the opening of the M6 in November 1963
 much of the traffic was diverted from 
 these roads. Our school log book says:
     "The M6 motorway was opened on    
 Friday last and the school has to-day 
 enjoyed for the first time the        
 benefits of the great decrease in the 
 volume of traffic on the A50 road".   
     There is still a lot of traffic,  
 mainly cars, passing our school, but  
 very little compared to the traffic   
 using the motorway. Before the M6 was 
 opened all the heavy lorries, coaches 
 and delivery vans had to pass our     
 school, so it would have been very    
 noisy.
