		<content> Mr. Lyle M.P. for Mid Beds is strongly
 opposed to the Elstow proposals.  In a
 recent letter to his constituents he  
 writes " I will do everything I can to
 persuade NIREX to change their mind   
 and the Department of the Environment 
 not to grant  permission for any such 
 development".  He believes the        
 "Government should be looking at      
 alternative methods of solving the    
 problem of nuclear waste".  He        
 proposes "dry storage on site".  He   
 cites the example of other countries  
 such as West Germany and Sweden who   
 have rejected the system of shallow   
 land burial as proposed by NIREX.  He 
 concludes "it is unwise to place a    
 nuclear dump of this nature in such a 
 crowded county as Bedfordshire".      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
