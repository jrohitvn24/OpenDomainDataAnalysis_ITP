 On Sunday nights there is a children's
 programme when they play records for  
 the children and organise a quiz for  
 them as well.Sometimes the quiz is    
 records played at a faster speed and  
 they have to guess what the record is.
 There is another children's programme 
 on Wednesdays when the children are in
 bed. First they play records which the
 children choose then they have stories
 for the 5-7 year olds and then the    
 8-15 year olds.Sometimes people go    
 there and sing and play for the       
 patients. Children from Northwood     
 County Primary School go there and    
 sing every Christmas and at other     
 times.
