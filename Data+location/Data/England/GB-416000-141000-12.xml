		<title>12Summer Day on Bank of Avon</title>
		<content>  I sat on the bank of the river Avon  
 on a still summer day. The water is   
 quite fast flowing and very clear and 
 thick with water cress and about me   
 fly many insects including mayfly,    
 caddisfly and dragonflies. A brown    
 trout ripples the surface near the    
 middle of the stream rising to one of 
 the many insects. I can see a water   
 snail clinging to a plant and the     
 shells of freshwater mussels and      
 some I later identified as freshwater 
 nerite and keeled ramshorn.           
  All about me are wild flowers.The    
 iris are over,but there is water mint 
 purple -loosestrife and meadowsweet.  
  A water vole scuttles into its hole  
 in the bank and a sudden flash of blue
 reveals a kingfisher diving for its   
 tea.
