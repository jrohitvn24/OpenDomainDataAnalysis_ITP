		<content> Many dwellings cater for the tourist  
 in a simple way, such as Bed,Breakfast
 and Evening Meal.There is one site for
 tents and caravans at Thorne and high 
 qualitiy self catering accommodation  
 at The Old Rectory.There is little to 
 interest the visitor who has no love  
 for the countryside or for walking,   
 apart from the visitors' viewing      
 platform at the forge of The Cornish  
 Ironcraft Company_also a crafts       
 centre. The nearest shops are in      
 Kilkhampton, where there is also a    
 fine 17th century church. Many        
 tourists pass through, on the main    
 Bude to Bideford road. The nearby     
 reservoir at Tamar Lakes is host to   
 many interesting birds.You may sail   
 and fish there, but not swim.the      
 nearest beaches are at Duckpool, where
 there is a nature trail and           
 Sandymouth, where there are lifeguards</content>
