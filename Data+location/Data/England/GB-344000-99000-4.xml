		<title>04NETHERBURY POPULATION</title>
		<content> The combined population of three      
 parishes of Beaminster, Netherbury and
 Stoke Abbott in l89l was 3,868.  In   
 l98l this was 3,586.  Beaminster's    
 population has grown by about 1/4     
 whilst Netherbury's has declined by   
 about 1/3 and Stoke Abbott's by 60%,  
 no doubt due to the migration of rural
 workers and the loss of a once        
 thriving local flax industry.  Whilst 
 the whole age range is represented    
 here those aged over 60 outnumber the 
 rest.  This is an attractive          
 retirement area and local property    
 prices reflect this.  (The former     
 union workhouse is now regarded as a  
 very good address!)  Even so, neither 
 Netherbury nor Stoke Abbott can boast 
 a shop or post office and Netherbury  
 recently lost its only pub.
