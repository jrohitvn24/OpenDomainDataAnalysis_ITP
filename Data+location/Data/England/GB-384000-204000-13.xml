		<title>13OLD RESIDENT INTERVIEW</title>
		<content>   Two children interviewed one of the 
 oldest residents of Stroud.He attended
 Parliament Street School as a boy and 
 has always lived in the area.When     
 asked about his school days he said   
 that there were 6 classes including   
 the Infants and that the ages ranged  
 from 4 to 13.He was 13 years old when 
 he left school and took a job as a    
 drivers mate on a petrol wagon,for    
 which he was paid 15 shillings{(75p)}a
 week.                                 
   He said that there were small       
 private shops then,instead of         
 supermarkets,and there weren't any    
 one way streets or link roads.The main
 industries then were cloth mills,     
 carpet factories,engineering and      
 brewing.There are many more houses now
 compared with the past.
