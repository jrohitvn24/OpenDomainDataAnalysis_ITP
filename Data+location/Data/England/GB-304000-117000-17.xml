		<title>17EVENTS IN OUR VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Our village is rather isolated and so 
 quite a lot goes on within the village
 for the local people.There is a good  
 community spirit and people are good  
 at supporting events that take place. 
                                       
 We have a good Village Hall in        
 Holcombe Rogus and most events take   
 place there,such as Dances,Sales and  
 Fayres.Colonel and Mrs Dobree also    
 invite the local people to the lovely 
 Great Hall at Holcombe Court for      
 special occasions.We also have the    
 Church Fete on their lawn each summer.
                                       
 A lot of special events take place at 
 All Saints Church.Our Rector,Reverend 
 Marsh has been very good at organising
 events and interesting people in the  
 church.Unfortunately, he is just about
 to leave our village-July,1985
