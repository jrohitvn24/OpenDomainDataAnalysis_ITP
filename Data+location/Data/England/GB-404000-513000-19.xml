		<title>19FISHING IN THE RIVER TEES</title>
		<content> The River Tees here is well-stocked   
 with{Brown Trout}and Grayling.All of  
 the fishing is private or leased to   
 clubs,but visitor's permits are       
 available.Approved methods of fishing 
 are with{artificial fly}or natural    
 bait such as minnow or worm.Spinning  
 or maggot fishing are not allowed.For 
 this fast-flowing river wet-fly up or,
 more usually,downstream is the most   
 sporting method.Flies are lightly     
 hackled.Some of the favourites are:   
 Snipe &amp; Purple,Greenwell's Glory,March
 Brown,Partridge &amp; Orange &amp; Gold-ribbed
 Hare's Ear.Reduced{pollution}in the   
 tidal reaches in recent years has     
 brought back,after many year's        
 absence,migratory fish to a river     
 famous for its Salmon run since       
 pre-Norman times.
