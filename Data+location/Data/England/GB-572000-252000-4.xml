Much of the land to the south of the   
area is given over to {FRUIT FARMING}  
and the main grower is JUSTIN BROOKES  
LTD.   This firm was started by Mr     
Justin Brooke who was a member of the  
Brooke Bond family.  Justin Brooke     
was a great benefactor of the area not 
only providing work but giving to the  
poor and encouraging social activity.  
The firm is still the largest employer 
in the area. Large quantities of apples
are grown and the firm has a packing   
station and cold store at STRADISHALL. 
Pears,plums and soft fruit, especially 
strawberries, are grown and the firm   
bottles apple juice.
