		<content> The first village school, 1870,       
 opposite the church, is now a private 
 residence. The present school, opened 
 in 1960, has an average of 60-70      
 pupils on roll, who are conveyed by 5 
 mini-buses from neighbouring Butter-  
 leigh and Cadeleigh. The age range is 
 5-9. Pupils later transfer to a Middle
 School in Tiverton. The school has 3  
 classes and 3 teachers. There are good
 playing facilities, an outdoor        
 swimming pool, a small fish pond and a
 pottery kiln. Meals are cooked on the 
 premises. The Head Teacher is released
 from teaching duties one day per week.
 The Vicar calls weekly. Pupils present
 services in church at festival times. 
 Older children make music with        
 guitars, recorders and percussion.    
 Out of school activities are regular  
 and include a week's residential visit
 to the Isle of Wight.                 </content>
