		<content> This{Domesday Project}entry was       
 compiled by the children and teachers 
 of{Willingham County Primary School   
 with the help of parents and other    
 members of the local community.       
 Thanks are due for some of the        
 historical facts to Mr.Alan Fawcitt,  
 Mr.Dennis Jeeps and Dr.Smail. The     
 teachers mainly concerned in the work 
 were Mrs.F.M.Anderson, Mrs.V.C.Hope,  
 Mr.P.Bell and Mr.H.R.Goodwin.         
                                       
 There is an interesting link between  
 the original Domesday Book's          
 instigator,{William the Conqueror,}and
 the block covered by this entry in    
 that it was in a field near Willingham
 that William's army camped before     
 proceeding over the Fen Causeway to   
 attack{Hereward the Wake}and his      
 followers who were encamped in the    
 Isle of Ely.                          </content>
