		<title>14FORTS GILKICKER &amp; MONCKTON</title>
		<content>      Fort Gilkicker was built in or   
 around 1850 and up the top is a       
 cannon. They sometimes fire it when   
 there is a Royal Celebration.  They   
 built it on a beach so that they could
 see the enemy's attacks from boats.   
 There is a marsh around Fort Gilkicker
 so nobody could reach it on the       
 north,east and west sides.            
      Fort Monckton is also built up by
 the sea to protect Portsmouth Harbour.
 It is much bigger and commands a more 
 defensive position. Now it is used for
 keeping various Council machinery.    
      Both of these Forts are          
 government property and are maintained
 by the Ministry of Defence.
