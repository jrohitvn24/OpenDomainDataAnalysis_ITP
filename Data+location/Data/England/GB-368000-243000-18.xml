 Father  moved to Bosbury from Malvern 
 because it was better Land. At The    
 East End of The South Aisle is a      
 Chantry Chapel built about 1530 by Sir
 Rowland Morton and Thomas Morton.     
 It was to be used for saying masses   
 for  the souls of Sir Rowland's wife  
 Lady Elizabeth, who died in 1528, and 
 for the family. It has perpendicular  
 windows ( a Rare example of this      
 period of architecture in             
 Herefordshire ) with richly groined   
 fan vaulting.                         
                                       
 CELTIC BELL                           
 A Pre-Christian bell, rectangular in  
 shape, was dug up in a field in       
 Bosbury and bought by Mr. Joseph Baker
 in 1888 and later sold to the Horniman
 Museum (London) in 1895, where it     
 still remains.                        </content>
