		<title>07PAYTON'S NURSERY OF ALDERLEY</title>
		<content>    There has been a nursery on this   
 site for sixty years, although the    
 present owners, Mr. and Mrs. Payton   
 only bought it this year.             
    They decided to run the nursery    
 because the two shops they have in    
 Stockport had become too demanding on 
 their time.                           
    The opening hours for the nursery  
 are 8.30am to 5.00pm every day but the
 staff work fourteen hours a day,      
 looking after the flowers and doing   
 floral arrangements.                  
    The staff need a lot of knowledge  
 of plant care. They buy most of their 
 plants from other nurseries in        
 Cheshire, mainly one at Lower Peover. 
    Most of the conifers come from     
 Holland. They have 150 kinds of shrubs
 and nearly 80 kinds of conifers. The  
 most popular kinds of plants are      
 heathers,climbing plants and conifers.</content>
