		<title>06SHOP PRICES COMPARED</title>
		<content> Prices of 23 items at the village     
 shops in Jackson Bridge and Hepworth  
 were compared to those in three       
 Supermarkets further away. There was a
 difference of Â£1.11(14%) between      
 shopping in Hepworth and Asda.        
                    food   other  total
 Hepworth           Â£7.81  Â£1.50  Â£9.31
 Jackson Bridge     Â£7.94  Â£1.19  Â£9.13
 Lodges(Holmfirth)  Â£7.00  Â£1.79  Â£8.79
 Asda(Huddersfield) Â£6.67  Â£1.53  Â£8.20
 Sainsbury(Hudds)   Â£7.17  Â£1.56  Â£8.73
 There were far more things to choose  
 from at the supermarkets.We found the 
 village shops stocked smaller sizes   
 which cost more in the end eg. small  
 coffee cost 49p for 25g in Hepworth   
 but 79p for 50g in Huddersfield.      
 However old people and those without  
 cars might find the local shops       
 cheaper and more convenient taking    
 into account transport costs and time.</content>
