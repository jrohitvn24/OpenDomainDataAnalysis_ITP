		<content> We also asked people if they had any  
 of these modern home improvements: 1. 
 insulation 2.double glazing           
 3.shower.                             
     We found that nearly half the     
 people had some kind of insulation    
 and also about half had a shower      
 installed.                            
     Less than one-third of homes      
 surveyed had some double glazing in.  
 The main reason why not so many houses
 have had installed is because of the  
 expense.In fact two replies did say   
 they would love to have double glazing
 but they afford it!
