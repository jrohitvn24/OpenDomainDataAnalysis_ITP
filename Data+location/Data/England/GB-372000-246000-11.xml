		<title>11A SALESMAN LIVING IN CRADLEY</title>
		<content>  He has lived in Cradley for seven    
 years.He was born in Birmingham then  
 moved to Worcester where the houses   
 were cheaper than in Birmingham.After 
 this he moved to Cradley.He says there
 are many improvements that could be   
 made such as a better bus sevice,a    
 better village pub,an adventure       
 playgrond for children and also an    
 active youth club to keep teenagers   
 out of mischief.He does not work in   
 Cradley as his work takes him all over
 Britain and sometimes abroad.He says  
 schools of today are very different   
 because we have computers and do many 
 more subjects.The thing he hates most 
 of all is the possibility of a nuclear
 war.He says the present day fashions  
 give him a good laugh.
