		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF OUR AREA</title>
		<content>   Our area is a rural area with one   
 small village called{Folly Gate}and a 
 Hamlet called{Brightley. }The river   
 Okement runs though a lovely wooded   
 valley on the eastern side. The       
 holiday route which takes the traffic 
 round{Okehampton }goes through the    
 centre of{Folly Gate}which  makes it  
 very busy during the summer.{         
{  Folly Gate}is often snowed up in the
 winter as it is very high up and      
 exposed. The children at Okehampton   
 Comprehensive are always sent home    
 early if it looks like it's going to  
 snow. There is a bus service which    
 passes through Folly Gate about four  
 times a day.                          
  {Woods}cover a large area and are    
 mostly coniferous.  It is a very hilly
 area with high banks along the sides  
 of the roads and in spring and summer 
{wild flowers}are in abundance.        </content>
