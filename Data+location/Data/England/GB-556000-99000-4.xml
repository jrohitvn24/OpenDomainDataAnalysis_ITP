 MY SCHOOL IS CALLED A COMPREHENSIVE   
 SCHOOL BECAUSE IT IS SUPPOSED TO      
 PROVIDE AN ALL ROUND EDUCATION SUITED 
 TO THE NEEDS AND ABILITIES OF THE     
 PUPILS.THIS MEANS THAT WE CAN MAKE    
 SOME DECISIONS IN THE CHOICE OF       
 SUBJECTS THAT WE FOLLOW.              
 WE START AT 0845 IN THE MORNING AND   
 END AT 1530 WITH ONE BREAK OF 20      
 MINUTES AND ONE HOUR FOR LUNCH.       
 LUNCHTIME IS VERY LATE BY WHICH TIME I
 AM USUALLY QUITE HUNGRY.              
 WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT LESSONS TO 
 GO TO BUT I DO NOT LIKE THEM ALL.WE   
 ALL HAVE TO DO ENGLISH AND MATHS BUT  
 WE ARE NOW LEARNING TO USE COMPUTERS. 
 I HAVE GOT A COMPUTER OF MY OWN.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
