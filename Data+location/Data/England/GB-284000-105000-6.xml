		<content> In alternative Julys there            
 is a {Revel}held at Jack's Acre.It is 
 organised by the{PTA}.The money raised
 goes to the school.At the Revel there 
 are lots of stalls.The{ducking stool  
 is the most popular,where you have to 
 throw a ball at a  target which makes 
 someone fall into a pool.There are    
 lots of smaller games stalls like     
 hoopla where you can  win prizes.There
 is also a greasy pole where you sit on
 a pole with a sack of straw and hit   
 the opposite person. Sometimes there  
 is a pony which you can ride in a side
 field.Near the end of the Revel there 
 is a{tug of war}competition.People in 
 the village will make up teams for the
 revel.There is an ice cream stall and 
 a tea tent. Sometimes  in the after-  
 noon there is a fancy dress competit- 
 ion and afterwards there is a parade.
