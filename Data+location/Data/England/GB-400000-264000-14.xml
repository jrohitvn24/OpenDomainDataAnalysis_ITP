		<title>14NEW WATER TOWER REDDITCH</title>
		<content>{The New Water Tower}was built in 1973 
 because of the new town of Redditch   
 being built,and undergoing            
 considerable growth. It had become    
 increasingly obvious that existing    
 reservoir storage would be totally    
 inadequate to meet the needs of the   
 new town. The old water tower had     
 become obsolete in the 1950's. Built  
 at Headless Cross,with a capacity of  
 250,000 gallons,it was designed to    
 cater for the needs of present and    
 future properties in the high level   
 area.                                 
{The New Water Tower}consisted of a    
 concrete cylindrical tower structure, 
 very modern in outloook, and very     
 different from the old tower.It also  
 has a new reservoir for 8 million     
 gallons.                              
 It stands as a landmark on the        
 Redditch skyline.                     </content>
