		<content> On Saturday, 8th June, 1771 the corn  
 miller, Francis Best who lived at     
 Caldwall Mill near the Staffordshire  
 and Worcestershire Canal, was walking 
 across what is now the West Midland   
 Safari Park on his way to Bewdley.    
 He was attacked by a man armed with a 
 stick who finally cut his throat and  
 stole Â£12 from him.                   
 The murderer, John Child, a journeyman
 weaver by trade, was hanged at        
 Worcester on 18th July, 1771.
