		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LISA</title>
		<content> Afternoon school starts at 1.00 p.m.  
 In the afternoon we usually have      
 lessons like Social Studies, or Art   
 and Games. The bell goes at 2.25 for  
 last break. I usually still have a few
 sweets left so I eat these then play  
 for a few minutes. School finishes at 
 3.35 and I go home for my tea. I have 
 some chip cobs and a cup of tea.      
 At 5 o'clock I go to the St. John's   
 Ambulance Brigade Cadets where we     
 learn about First Aid. Every year     
 there is a big parade and competition 
 held at the Miners' Holiday Centre in 
 Skegness. I get back from the meeting 
 at 6 o'clock.                         
 I can play out again until 8 o'clock  
 when I come in for a bath and then    
 watch television until 10 o'clock.    
 I have three biscuits and a cup of tea
 for my supper. Then I go to bed.
