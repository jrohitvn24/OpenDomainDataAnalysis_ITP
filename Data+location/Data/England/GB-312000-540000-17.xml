		<content> This section of the Domesday Project  
 has been researched and recorded by   
 the third year pupils of this school. 
 There are 28 pupils in our class an   
 about 180 in the whole school.The age 
 range is from 5 to 11, we have both   
 infant and junior children in school. 
 We have a school sale every year to   
 raise money to buy things like the    
 computer that we are writing this on. 
 The parents' association help us a    
 great deal in raising money too.      
 We have a harvest festival in October 
 and all the fruit and vegetables we   
 bring in for that are taken to the old
 folks home called Park Lodge in       
 Outgang Road.                         
 At Christmas we decorate the school   
 and the infants have a party in school
 when Father Christmas comes  and      
 brings them all a present. The juniors
 have a disco at the Rugby Club.       </content>
