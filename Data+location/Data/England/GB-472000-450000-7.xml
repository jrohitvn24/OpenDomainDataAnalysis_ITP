		<title>07WILBERFOSS THE SCHOOL HEAD.</title>
		<content>    The head wakes up at 7.30 am each  
 morning and arrives at school from    
 nearby Pocklington at about 8.30 am.  
 His first job is to check and open all
 stock cupboards. Up to morning        
 playtime at 10.30 am he opens mail and
 does odd jobs like photocopying. Most 
 days he takes classes so that other   
 teachers can do subjects like music   
 and games with other classes. He      
 always has a school dinner and enjoys 
 them! During lunchtime he attends any 
 staff meetings and sorts out day to   
 day problems. From lunchtime to after-
 noon playtime he attends to           
 outstanding jobs such as cataloguing  
 library books.                        
    He enjoys his job as head of the   
 village school, but says he sometimes 
 misses having a class of his own.     
 Like any other job, he says, there are
 bad days, but these are few.          </content>
