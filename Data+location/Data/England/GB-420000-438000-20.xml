		<content>  Running across our D block is the A65
 ,a very busy road.By taking several   
 traffic counts we found that          
 approx.8,220,576 vehicles use the road
 in one year.By further calculation we 
 discovered this is one vehicle every 4
 seconds!                              
  From a survey carried out in school  
 we found that 104 out of 128 families 
 used a car for work.39% of those      
 surveyed said the roads were in poor  
 condition,but many said that public   
 transport was good.Excessive speed and
 too many heavy lorries were two major 
 worries.                              
  Though only the runway is in our D   
 block,the airport is a cause for      
 concern.64% of the survey were in     
 favour of the runway extension,30%    
 mentioning increased employment as    
 areason.Only 14% were against futher  
 developments.                         </content>
