		<content> Langton Green has changed immensely   
 since it's birth. Miss Hayne who has  
 lived here for 80 years has implements
 7000 years old, such as flint scrapers
 and an axe head. Such things are not  
 used today. The village has changed;  
 although a lot of old cottages still  
 stand, there are modern houses too.   
 Barrow Lane which was once a packhorse
 track now has cars hurtling down it.  
 Many years ago the main transport was 
 horses but now bus services pass      
 through the village. The inhabitants  
 used to work locally but now a lot of 
 them commute. There are now several   
 shops along the main road including   
 two small supermarkets; we also have  
 amenities such as two pubs, a garage, 
 a printers and an old peoples home.   
 The old village school is still       
 standing but is not in use, instead   
 we have a modern village school.      </content>
