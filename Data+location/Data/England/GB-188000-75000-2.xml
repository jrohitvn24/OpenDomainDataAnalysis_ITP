		<title>02PADSTOW'S FISHING INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> Padstow's fishing industry is enjoying
 a new lease of life after the general 
 decline since the railway closed in   
 1967,in fact it is now the{3rd largest
{fishing port in the S.W.}Two main     
 reasons are a new{fuel supply tank}   
 situated on the quayside,and an{      
{ice-making machine}next to it,        
 supplying the ice needed to keep newly
 caught fish fresh.Padstow has many    
 local boats which rarely stay out of  
 port for more than 36 hours,fishing   
 for{mackerel,dog-fish,lobsters and    
{crabs.}Larger trawlers,for deep-sea   
 fishing, are basing themselves in     
 Padstow, though it will be some time  
 before{the harbour will hold 138      
{fishing boats again,}which one elderly
 resident recalls seeing as a young boy
 in the 1920's when a storm put a stop 
 to all fishing at sea.
