		<title>06A DAY: IN LIFE OF A WORKER</title>
		<content> My father is a local odd job builder  
 and live in an interesting cottage    
 which has needed much renovation.He   
 needs to have a car and a van.He      
 leaves the car at home for our mother 
 to drive us to school for our route is
 along the A 40 and parts of it have no
 foot-paths whilst he goes to work in  
 the van which carries his tools, etc. 
 needed for the various jobs.These jobs
 can vary from doing repairs on        
 churches to helping to repair chicken 
 sheds.Transport costs are high for it 
 may be necessary for him to travel    
 considerable distances to undertake   
 work.Many jobs are in places along    
 muddy and stony tracks.He used to play
 football and go to Track Races or go  
 elvering in the Severn Estuary but    
 this is only possible on weekends for 
 his hours are long during the         
 week-days.                            </content>
