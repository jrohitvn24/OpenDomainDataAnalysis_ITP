		<content> Very few residents actually work in   
 the area covered in this grid.Most    
 tend to commute to the Potteries,     
 Alsager, Crewe or Congleton for their 
 employment.The largest employment     
 found within the confines of the grid 
 is agriculture but this only accounts 
 for a small percentage of the total   
 workforce. A small number of women    
 find occupation in the local shops.   
 In Rode Heath there is a small        
 computer firm but the majority of its 
 workforce comes from outside the area.
 There is also a haulage firm but again
 the workforce tend not to live in the 
 area.                                 
 Having stated this, it is important to
 note that unemployment is well below  
 the national average.
