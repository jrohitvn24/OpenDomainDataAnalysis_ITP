		<title>12CHURCH IN THEDDINGWORTH</title>
		<content> The 12th Century Church of All Saints 
 stands in a closed churchyard in the  
 centre of the village on the main     
 road. The building is of stone and has
 a steeple with five bells, the        
 earliest being cast in 1595 &amp; all are 
 in working order. The boundary, also  
 stone, between the road and Church has
 recently been completely rebuilt by a 
 local builder. The present churchyard 
 was filled in 1890 and there is a     
 churchyard extension opposite the     
 Church which is used for present day  
 burials. Inside the Church there is   
 the  Snetzler Organ which was built in
 1754 and features colourful paintings 
 inside the panels which cover the     
 pipes, and also a reversed keyboard - 
 black keys white and white keys black.
 It is still used for services. The    
 Font dates from Norman times and is   
 also still used.                      </content>
