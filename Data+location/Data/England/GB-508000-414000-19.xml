		<content> On Sunday at l.l5 I went riding at a  
 riding school in Abbey Road. We did   
 trotting in a paddock then after about
 l5 minutes we went round Carr Road and
 my stirrup came off when "Mouse"      
 jumped a puddle! I had to have my pony
 tied up to a horse because I'm only a 
 learner. It was only my first day with
 Victoria and Beth who said I was good 
 for my first time. It cost Â£2.7O per  
 hour. My Mum said that it isn't worth 
 it. When we got to the railway station
 it started raining and I got soaked   
 because I hadn't got my hood on. We   
 got to a field where we had to leave  
 the horses and then we went home. I   
 walked so far with Carolyn Robinson   
 and I walked the rest of the way on my
 own. When I got home I had to change  
 my clothes, I put a dress on and my   
 old shoes. It had stopped raining and 
 Bernadette came.                      </content>
