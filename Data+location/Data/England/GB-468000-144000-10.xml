		<content> Weston Patrick: A fire in 1886        
 destroyed 12 cottages and a private   
 house. 47 people were made homeless   
 but there was no loss of life.        
 Place Names: Weston Patrick is named  
 after Patrick de Chaworth and Weston  
 Corbett after Thomas Corbett both of  
 whom held the land in the 13th Cent.  
 A house in Weston Patrick is called   
 "The Case is Altered". Various        
 explanations for the origin of the    
 name have been put forward but the    
 most probable explanation is that it  
 is on the site of a public house      
 started up by veterans returning      
 from the Peninsular War and named Casa
 de Saltar,Casa Alta or Casa Alta Douro
 and later the name became anglicised.
