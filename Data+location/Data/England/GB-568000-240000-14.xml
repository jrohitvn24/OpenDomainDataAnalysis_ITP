		<content> The name of the village is derived    
 from the brook which passes through   
 it.It does not seem to have any       
 relation to birds, but there are many 
 attractive bird plaques on the        
 cottages.The{church}was built in 11th 
 century,using stone flint and pebble  
 rubble mixed with tiles gleaned from a
{Roman villa.}For the last 12 years    
 there has been a{Flower Festival}in   
 the church. It is held in June.This   
 year the theme is The Life Of         
 Moses.The church is decorated with    
 flowers to tell the story. The money  
 collected is going to The Save the    
 Children Fund and to the Restoration  
 Fund.{The Old Post House}dates back to
 1840 when it was an ale house called  
 THE WHITE HORSE.Then it was a bakery  
 and it was used as a post office      
 until 1967.
