		<title>02Introduction to Land Cover</title>
		<content> This area is in the heart of rural    
 North Northumberland. The land is     
 predominantly cultivated and the      
 generally rich soils are a bonus for  
 the farming community. Apart from the 
 village of Belford, central to the    
 area, there are only a number of farms
 providing housing for a limited number
 of farm workers.                      
 The land is relatively flat to the    
 North-East, East and South-East of the
 village but rises quite steeply to the
 South-West and directly to the North. 
 The undulating land is punctuated by a
 few rocky crags and outcrops that form
 part of the more widespread Whinstone 
 Ridge. There is a small amount of     
 woodland which has mainly been planted
 as protection for the farms although  
 some has been developed by the        
 Forestry Commission.
