		<content>Our area includes Collier St. and      
Queens St. They are divided by the     
R.Teise and there is no direct road    
link across. The population is 572 but 
by the year 2000 it may be 600. The    
area has services like the postman who 
comes everyday and the dustman and     
library. Both of these come every week.
There is only 1 general store          
including  a post office.There is a    
fete in the area every year.This year  
it was in aid of the church which was  
badly burned in January.Land use has   
changed as there are less fruit trees  
and hops and more cereal crops. Also   
employment and housing has changed.    
Fewer people are employed on the farms 
now and people from outside are coming 
to buy and modernise old properties    
e.g. oast houses and farmworkers       
cottages. People commute to London or  
Maidstone to work.                     </content>
