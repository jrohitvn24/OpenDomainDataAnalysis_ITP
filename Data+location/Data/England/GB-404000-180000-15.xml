		<title>15Local History in W.Bassett</title>
		<content>{ Milo Crispin }owned most of the land 
 in Wootton Bassett and was mentioned  
 in the original Domesday Book.It was  
 ploughland,pasture and woodland.It was
 worth Â£9.                             
 The{Bassett Family }built a Manor     
 House called Vastern.One of the family
 shared in the signing of Magna Carta  
 and another Bassett founded a Priory  
 in Wood Street.One of the oldest      
 houses in our town is built on the    
 site of the Old Priory.It is called   
 Priory Cottage.                       
  The{Town Hall}is different from      
 others because it stands on 15        
 pillars.It has been there from 1690   
 and its stocks were used to punish    
 disorderly people.                    
  The town has grown a  lot in the{last
{10 years }because it is near the M4   
 Motorway and RAF Lyneham.Now it has no
 Member of Parliament of its own.      </content>
