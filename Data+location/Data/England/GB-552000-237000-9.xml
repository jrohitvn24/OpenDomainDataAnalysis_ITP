 Saffron Walden has not always had this
 name. In the middle ages it was called
 Chipping Walden. 'Chipping' meant     
 merchants because this was a market   
 town where fairs were held. After this
 time it became famous for the saffron 
 crocus. From the stamens of this      
 crocus was obtained saffron. This was 
 extremely expensive and became the    
 major industry. Thus the name of the  
 town changed. The saffron crocus is   
 not grown commercially now.
