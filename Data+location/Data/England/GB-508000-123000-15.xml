		<content> The{bicycle}is the universal toy but  
 it has undergone many changes with the
 taste now for{'BMX'.}A padded, strong 
 frame, small wheels and rugged tyres  
 make this off-street bike ideal for   
 cross-country riding and stunts.      
 Indoor toys see{Lego}a clear favourite
 with magazines and exhibitions        
 promoting its popularity with both    
 sexes. Board games like{Monopoly}are  
 still favourites as are classics like 
{chess &amp; marbles. Dolls}still rate     
 highly although the emphasis is often 
 on outfits and accessories (including 
 cars &amp; swimming pools!) rather than   
 the character of the doll itself      
 (unlike the recent{'Cabbage Patch'    
 doll phenomenon where every doll was  
 individual).{Video}arcade games and   
 computerised{adventure games}compete  
 for time with{books}(although reading 
 may be in decline).                   </content>
