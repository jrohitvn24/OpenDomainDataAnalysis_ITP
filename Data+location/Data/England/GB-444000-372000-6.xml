		<title>06My Pigeons and I.</title>
		<content>   I love my pigeon he is blotched with
 red green and black.  He has won two  
 races for me,{the Dorchester}and the  
{Short Race.} I sent him across the    
 water and he came in third,and I won a
 badge with a pigeon on it.            
  Our pigeon's cote is called{Smithurst
{and Son.} I found my pigeon in a crows
 nest,so I took him home.              
   I found him two years ago when I was
 eight years old.  I like my pigeons   
 very much.  His mate{Eagle}has had two
 baby chicks.  Their names are{Bit}and 
{Black.} I also have a pigeon called   
 Three Seasons because he got lost and 
 was away for three flying seasons,and 
 when he came back we named him{Three  
{Seasons.
