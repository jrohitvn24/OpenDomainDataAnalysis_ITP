		<title>15TRADE (FROYLE/HOLYBOURNE)</title>
		<content> There are {village shops} in          
 Holybourne, Upper Froyle and Lower    
 Froyle.                               
 Although Altn is only 3 miles away    
 from Froyle and almost next door to   
 Holybourne, people find it very       
 convenient to buy extra things from   
 the village shop even if they go to   
 the supermarket for their weekly      
 'shop'.  The village shops sell a     
 variety of things like groceries,     
 fruit and vegetables, medicines       
 (non-prescription), toys and sometimes
 wines and spirits too.                
 They also all have a {Post Office     
{counter}where people can buy stamps.  
 send telegrams, cash pensions etc.    
 without a special journey into Alton. 
 In Holybourne the {market garden}     
 sells vegetables, fruit, flowers and  
 plants and in the summer there is a   
 'pick your own' scheme.               </content>
