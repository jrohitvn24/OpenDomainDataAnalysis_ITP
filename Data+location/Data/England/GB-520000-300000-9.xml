		<content>  THE  BYPASS                          
 There is a dispute in{Eye}over the    
 bypass that is going to be built .    
 There are two proposed routes, the    
 North and the South. The Government   
 wants it to go North because there are
 already foundations laid from the old 
 dismantled railway track. People in   
{Eye }who have dogs take them  down the
 railway track and clay pits for       
 exercise. If it goes North thay will  
 be cut off from the railway track and 
 clay pits.                            
 These are the arguments :             
 The shop owners in{Eye}don't want the 
 by pass to be made anywhere because   
 they will lose money from the cars,   
 vans and lorries that usually stop at 
 their shops. The farmers don't want   
 the bypass to go the southern route   
 because it will go through good farm  
 land and they mightnlose money.       </content>
