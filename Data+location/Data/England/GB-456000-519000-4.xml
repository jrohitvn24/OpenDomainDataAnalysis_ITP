		<content> Being largely rural,it is perhaps not 
 suprising to find that most people    
 have lived in the area all of their   
 lives.We have found however that a    
 number of people had moved within the 
 area.A small number of council houses 
 in Whalehill contain tenants re_housed
 as a result of a nearby slum clearance
 programme.Of people  interviewed most 
 described themselves as working class 
 but in some cases showed certain      
 attributes of a middle class person,  
 for example owning a microwave oven or
 a video.The vast majority of people   
 living in Wilton,Lackenby and         
 Kirkleatham were old and retired.Even 
 in Lazenby where there were a number  
 of large families with young children 
 there were still a third of the       
 population either retired or nearing  
 retirement.In general the population  
 of this area is decreasing.           </content>
