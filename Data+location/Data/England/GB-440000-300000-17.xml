		<content> Local people are generally very       
 conscious of the quality of their     
 environment and they express genuine  
 concern for its  conservation.  This  
 continuing awareness has resulted  in 
 the preservation and cultivation of   
 hedgerows, a more careful and         
 considered approach to stubble burning
 and a better appreciation of the      
 effects of multi-substance crop       
 spraying. This improvement in spraying
 practice has contributed to the       
 survival of many wild flower species. 
 Most of the elms in the area have,    
 however, succumbed to Dutch Elm       
 disease and have been replaced by oak,
 ash, or beech.                        
                                       
 Established wild life in the area     
 includes rabbits, hares, badgers,     
 stoats, and foxes, together with      
 pheasants, partridges and wild ducks. </content>
