		<content> Captain James Cook was the most       
 important person with whom Great Ayton
 has been associated, but her          
 connection with the sea continues as  
 Richard Crosthwaite, owner of Tees    
 Towing, lives in Langbaurgh Hall.     
 Another well-known local name is      
 Winterschladen, an expatriate German, 
 whose name is now given to a series of
 "wine shops".                         
                                       
 Grange Mill has been adapted as a     
 house from a very old water mill.  The
 oldest building in the village is All 
 Saints Church and Cliff Richard, the  
 pop singer, visited it recently.  The 
 Grange and Ayton Hall are also old    
 residences, and the latter is now a   
 successful hotel gaining 75% in the   
 1985 Egon Ronay Lucas Guide.
