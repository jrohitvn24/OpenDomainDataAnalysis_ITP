 Hi folks! We recently beamed down to a
 school called Northumberland Heath.   
 The beings all wear white shirts, blue
 ties, blue pullovers and grey trousers
 (boys), and skirts (girls)-wierd! They
 start school at 9.00a.m., at 9.10a.m. 
 they have assembly. Lessons are maths,
 English, project work, art, music and 
 sport. They have 15 minutes playtime  
 at 10.30a.m. and 2.15p.m.. Lunch is   
 12.00-1.15, some children have a      
 cooked meal for 66p. (Today sausage,  
 potato and peas, then ice cream - yum 
 yum!) Others bring sandwiches. There  
 are 35 children in one class (aged 9, 
 10 and 11). Winter games are soccer   
 (mainly boys), netball (mainly girls) 
 and in summer - rounders. Swimming    
 once a week for 10 and 11 year olds.  
 School ends at 3.30p.m..              </content>
