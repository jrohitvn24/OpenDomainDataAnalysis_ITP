		<title>17Local History Knowle Green</title>
		<content> Repairs to a section of the old Bobbin
 Mill now owned by Mini-prints revealed
 that it was a building without        
 foundations and possibly dating from  
 the 17th Century.   In former times,  
 Knowle Green had its own "Knocker-up" 
 who summoned labour to the mill in the
 early hours of the morning.           
                                       
 Half a mile west of Knowle Green is a 
 curious stone incribed by one         
 Radcliffe "to lie here forever" set in
 the hedgebank of farm approach and    
 known locally as the "Written Stone". 
                                       
 The eastern end of the area close to  
 the Hall's Arms and Newdrop Inn is the
 site of the Roman Road passing        
 northwards from Ribchester.   Its     
 straight course can be painly seen    
 from the motor car layby at Cardwell  
 House.                                </content>
