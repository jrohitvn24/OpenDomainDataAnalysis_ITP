		<title>04HOOK ACTION GROUP</title>
		<content> August 1983 saw the announcement that 
 a mini_town was to be built to the    
 north of Hook. The village was        
 very much aware of the rapid expansion
 it was undergoing and inhabitants felt
 that this addition would cause        
 unacceptable social strain on the     
 village.An action group -H.A.G.- was  
 formed to monitor and combat the extra
 development.                          
    The action group has succeeded in  
 fighting off a consortium of national 
 housebuilders by informing and        
 involving local people and lobbying   
 the government. Local developers,     
 Charles Church,have taken over the    
 site and are waiting for planning     
 permission. The proposal is for 5,000 
 houses, complete with schools, shops  
 and community buildings but no more   
 office developments.
