		<content> Health comes within the South East    
 Area Health Authority. There are many 
 elderly people, most still vigorous.  
 Geriatric hospitals are at Ashford and
 Canterbury as are the general         
 hospitals.  Most people attend general
 practitioners in Wye or Chilham.      
 Dentists are at Wye, Ashford and      
 Canterbury as are opticians.  As the  
 air is clean and fresh the population 
 is fairly healthy. There are no       
 special facilities for the disabled   
 actually within the area.
