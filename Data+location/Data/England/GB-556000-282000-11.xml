		<content> The Festival was held on the 22/23rd  
 of June.{Derek Andrews (Prickwillow   
{Pottery)}was the co-ordinator. There  
 were traditional Village events such  
 as a Pigeon Shoot, Farm Rides, Bowls, 
 Church Fete, Vintage cars, Exhibition 
 and Flower Festival. Each event       
 supported a particular Charity such as
 Oxfam, Village Hall Fund, Steeple     
 restoration fund, Prickwillow drainage
 Engine Trust.                         
  The Exhibition{Portrait of a Village 
 consisted of entries by local painters
 photographers, writers and crafts     
 people on the subject of Prickwillow  
 and its people. Sales of work went to 
 Charity. More than 2,000 people came  
 to this weekend Festival.             
 Derek felt that small Villages needed 
 attention drawn to the quality of life
 in them, despite depopulation and loss
 of services.                          </content>
