		<content>{Double Arches Quarries,}one of the    
 most important in the area, has been  
 the scene of many interesting finds.  
                                       
 One of these involved the remains of  
 two{Romano-British}people.The male had
 his head chopped off but he actually  
 died from a piercing blow to the head 
 behind the ear. The female body had no
 such featues.{Saxon}pottery was found 
 around the bodies.                    
                                       
 A{Roman}well was found at Double      
 Arches but the evidence was destroyed 
 before expert examination. Nine inches
 below ground there was circular       
 brickwork, the bottom was 12 feet     
 lower. Unexplained, was a 'V' shaped  
 grove in the top of the brickwork.
