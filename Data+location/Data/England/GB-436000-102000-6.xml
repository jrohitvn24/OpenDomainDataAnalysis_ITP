		<title>06BEAULIEU MOTOR MUSEUM</title>
		<content>   The  Motor Museum is owned by Lord  
 Montague. It has a wide range of      
 activities for all ages. The main     
 building contains cars dating from    
{1870}to {1970.}                       
   They have the {Gold Arrow}in the    
 Motor Museum along with the {Blue     
{Bird.                                 
{ }They have a monorail going round the
 Motor Museum to give people a bird's  
 eye view of the area. This runs       
 through the top of the main building  
 so you get a good view of all the     
 cars. They have a new ride called     
 Wheels. It covers a hundred years of  
 motoring. You sit in a small cart and 
 go round and see the cars. {          
{   }Lord Montagu has a firework       
 display once a year. There is a wide  
 range of fireworks and it is normally 
 very good. {
