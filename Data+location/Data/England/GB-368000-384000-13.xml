 Cattle.Mr Cookson has 160 Milking Cows
 and 30 dry Cows at any one time.One   
 Cow produces 6,000 litres of milk per 
 year.The cows eat Barley and          
 Silage.Silage is made from cut grass. 
   THe farm had some Charolet and      
 Fresian Bulls.The calfs were sold off 
 at about 14-18 months,they were sold  
 for beef. The Charolet was a creamy   
 colour and the Fresian was black and  
 white.The Bull weighs 900Kg and would 
 cost about Â£1,000.                    </content>
