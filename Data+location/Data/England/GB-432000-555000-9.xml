		<title>09A DAY IN DALE'S LIFE</title>
		<content> Today I woke up at 7.00, had breakfast
 of cereal and orange juice, got ready 
 and left for school at 8.40 for the 5 
 min. walk to school. When school began
 we walked up the corridor into the    
 class and then went to assembly. After
 maths and P.E.it was dinner time. We  
 had beefburgers, potato and gravy. We 
 went outside for another game of      
 rounders. After English lessons school
 finished at 3.30. I ran home, had my  
 tea, went outside to play tennis for  
 almost two hours then returned to play
 on my computer. I did my 350 piece    
 jigsaw of a sailing ship which took me
 nearly all night.                     
 When I had finished I went to the fish
 and chip shop and bought a bag of     
 chips for 26p. I ate my chips at home 
 and went to bed at 10.00p.m.
