		<title>11TOURISM IN GREAT AYTON</title>
		<content> Many people go to the Low Green       
 on a Sunday afternoon where their     
 children can safely paddle in the     
 River Leven.  The cross bred Mallard  
 ducks and their ducklings are an      
 attraction in early summer.   The Buck
 Hotel is opposite Low Green and has   
 recently been adapted to cater for    
 families, providing meals as well as  
 continental style outdoor tables.  The
 Norman All Saints Church attracts some
 tourists.  Many Australians visit     
 Great Ayton because of its connection 
 with Captain James Cook: an obelisk in
 a garden marks the former site of his 
 parents' cottage, removed to Melbourne
 in 1934.                              
                                       
 There is a successful and popular     
 Caravan Club listed site on the       
 north-west edge of the village.
