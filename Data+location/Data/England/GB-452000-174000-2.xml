		<title>02The Green Telephone Box</title>
		<content> Yattendon is the only village with a  
 green telphone box. There is a great  
 story to that. One day a man from     
 British Telecom came and painted the  
 telphone box red,but in the night     
 somebody painted it green. In the     
 morning , everyone stopped their cars 
 in amazement. They said to each other 
 "I thought they painted that red!"    
   If you look closely you can see     
 chips out of the paint,and you can see
 the red paint underneath.             
   That's the story of the green       
 telephone box.                        
                                       
   Yatttendon is unusual in that most  
 of the village and a great deal of the
 surrounding land is owned by one man, 
{Lord Iliffe.}He used to live in       
 Yattendon Court but when the M4       
 motorway was built in 1971 he moved   
 to Basildon.                          </content>
