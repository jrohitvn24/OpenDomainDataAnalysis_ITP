		<content>    At Grizedale we have the largest   
 forest in the Lakes maintained by     
 the{Forestry Commission.}             
                                       
    The trees are planted in Spring    
 with a spade called a schlich. They   
 will grow for approximately 50 years. 
                                       
{   Sitka Spruce}is the main crop      
 because this variety will grow on many
 soils. About 10% of the forest however
 comprises deciduous trees grown mainly
 on the lower slopes.                  
                                       
    In different seasons the jobs      
 carried out are planting, weeding,    
 draining, felling, and fencing. The   
 trees are felled with chainsaws and   
 large machinery such as tractors and  
 forwarders bring it the road side.    
 Sub-contractors are employed to       
 transport the timber away.            </content>
