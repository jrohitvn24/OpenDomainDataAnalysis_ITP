		<content>  Typically N.F.,only 16 dwellings,has 
 both woodland enclosures and moorland.
 Includes highest point of NF (Pipers  
 Wait) and edge of conservation area   
 of Fritham village. E half has        
 forest &amp; farm land &amp; villages of      
 Brook and Bramshaw.  Two main types   
 of population: 1) Those who work in   
 area, often of old Forest stock eg.   
 Commoners with smallholdings, keepers,
 agisters, foresters, those working    
 in hotels or golf courses. 2) Those   
 who worked in business or             
 professions in neighbouring towns     
 and villages, many now retired.  The  
 two groups have different             
 backgrounds but share a natural       
 conservatism which unites them in     
 preserving fragile environment of     
 NF.They may, of course, differ as     
 how best to achieve this.
