		<title>14FURZE HILL - A VANTAGE POINT</title>
		<content>  Furze Hill is the highest point in   
 the area and from the top you can see 
 most of the island. My class visited  
 the hill recently and to the south we 
 could see the Swale, which separates  
 the Isle of Sheppey from the mainland,
 and Sheppey's only link,the Kingsferry
 Bridge. To the east we could see the  
 town of Queenborough, which seems to  
 be surrounded by imported,parked cars,
 and to the north-east, Sheerness      
 Docks, from which the Olau Line ferry 
 was sailing to Holland. To the north  
 we could see the towns of Bluetown and
 Sheerness and in the far distance,    
 across the Thames estuary, the Essex  
 town of Southend. To the west we could
 see the village of Minster with       
 Minster Abbey at the top of the hill, 
 and to the south-west, in the distance
 across the marshes, we could see      
 Eastchurch Prison.   Stephen Carr.    </content>
