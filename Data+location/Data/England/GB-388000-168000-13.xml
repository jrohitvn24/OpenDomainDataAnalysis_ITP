		<title>13Attitudes in Lacock</title>
		<content> Lacock is a very pretty village and   
 most of the inhabitants are glad to   
 live there.  They enjoy the beauty of 
 their surroundings and the            
 peacefulness of the countryside.      
 However, some of the younger people   
 find the amenities poor.              
{Entertainment}for the young is        
 negligible and the{shops}are          
 expensive and stock a limited range of
 goods.                                
 While the villagers find the{tourists 
 a necessity for the economics of      
 Lacock, they are also considered      
 something of a nuisance.  Between May 
 and September, cars, coaches and      
 people fill the High Street and normal
 life is disrupted.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
