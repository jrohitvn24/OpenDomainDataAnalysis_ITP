		<title>13Barby Village Hall</title>
		<content>   The Village Hall is the centre of   
 the community life in Barby. When the 
 new school was built the old school   
 was extended and became the Village   
 hall. There are several small rooms a 
 kitchen and a big hall. The hall is   
 used on many days for badminton       
 although the roof isn't really high   
 enough. Other rooms are used as a     
 doctor's surgery when the doctor      
 comes.                                
   The Youth Club use the hall once a  
 week. The old age pensioners meet     
 regularly in one of the rooms.        
   It is possible for anyone to hire   
 the hall but it can cost as much as   
 Â£40 for a Saturday night dance.       
   The hall also has a stage that can  
 be used for plays and concerts.       
 Barby's Village Hall is much better   
 than Kilsby's. Kilsby is having their 
 Village Hall extended this year.      </content>
