		<title>09OLDEST SHOP IN S.CROYDON</title>
		<content> Trengrove Antiques is situated in     
 South Croydon's main street,known as  
 South End.It was converted for use as 
 a shop in the early 1800's.Before it  
 bacame an{antique shop}it was a       
 greengrocers ,and before that a       
 semi_detached cottage.The shop has    
 been in the family for well over a    
 century.It still retains its wooden   
 supports,although the back of the shop
 has been rebuilt by the present owner,
 Brian Trengrove.                      
 The wooden beamed front with its high 
 class antiques seems the ideal place  
 for a{supernatural}siting.Strange     
 noises and groanings have been heard ,
 and a white figure resmbling          
 Mr.Trengrove's great grandfather has  
 been seen.
