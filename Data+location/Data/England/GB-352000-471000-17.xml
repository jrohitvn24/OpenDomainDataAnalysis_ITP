 redundant farmhouse and its adjacent  
 barns. Keer Grange has been modernised
 completely changed-with oil fired     
 central heating,a fully equipped      
 kitchen etc and has plenty of space   
 for children to play.The 0.75 acre    
 garden is used primarily as a football

 some flowers,fruit and some vegetables
 .During the week,they are all         
 engaged with full time education;the  
 local High School and /Brian at

 take advantage of the local swimming  
 pool and tennis courts,the village    
 hall for badminton and the canal for  
 canoeing and as a family they are avid
 skiers.                               </content>
