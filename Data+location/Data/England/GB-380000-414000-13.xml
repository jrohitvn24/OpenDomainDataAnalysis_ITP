		<title>13FLETCHER BANK QUARRY</title>
		<content>   This open cast quarry was first dug 
 in 1792. It is situated N of Bury near
 the M 66. About 25 men are employed in
 the quarry and about 100 at the nearby
 paving stone factory.                 
   The stone is {HELMSHAW GRIT}and {   
{FLETCHER BANK GRIT.}The stone is      
 quarried using gelignite. The walls of
 the quarry collapsing onto the floor. 
   The spoil heaps of waste material   
 from the quarrying are covered with   
 topsoil and grass is planted to       
 prevent the quarry becoming an        
 eyesore.                              
   The steepness of the sides of the   
 quarry makes this a dangerous place   
 and so it is surrounded by a barbed   
 wire fence to prevent people and      
 animals from danger.
