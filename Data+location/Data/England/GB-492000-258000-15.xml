		<title>15Staploe, Three Hamlets Club</title>
		<content> Among numerous Evergreens and Darby   
 and Jones, Staploe can claim a        
 completely unique name for its over   
 60's Club "The Three Hamlets Club".   
 Started in 1970, the club, with a     
 membership of 40 to 50 holds monthly  
 meetings on a Saturday, in the village
 hall. Additional events, visiting     
 other clubs,Church services, day      
 outings and the annual bike ride take 
 place on week days. Completely self   
 financing, the club raises funds from 
 the tea money, raffles, Bingo and the 
 big annual Harvest Sale, when gardens 
 are stripped, preserves and cakes     
 made, jumble and books collected and a
 town club invited to buy cheap country
 produce. Each New Year a party        
 celebrates the "Hamlets" birthday,    
 with an iced cake, sherry and         
 sometimes a "home-grown" panto. Each  
 summer a Garden Party is held.        </content>
