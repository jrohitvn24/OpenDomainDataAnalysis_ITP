		<title>10Farming 5: The Future</title>
		<content>    All the farms in this area are     
 owned by the Eastbourne Corporation.  
 Most are held by farming tenants who  
 do not think that their farms have    
 much of a future as they have no      
 control over decisions made by the    
 Corporation.                          
    There is some public pressure to   
 persuade the Corporation to get rid of
 the farms and to let the land grow as 
 natural downland. If this happens all 
 the animals will have to go and the   
 pastures will become overgrown with   
 scrub. However, local farmers believe 
 that they are safe for one more       
 generation as the Corporation is also 
 committed to developing land at       
 Hampden Park for recreation.          
                                       
    The above information on farming is
 based on an interview with Mr Williams
 Bullockdown Farm.                     </content>
