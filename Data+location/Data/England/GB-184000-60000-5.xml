  {PORTH RESERVOIR}is used for fishing 
 because of the brown trout there. To  
 fish you have a long rod, running     
 across which is a fishing line. Only  
 fly fishing is allowed whereby the    
 fisherman casts out his line baited   
 with a fly selected in order to       
 attract the trout.The number of fish  
 is carefully monitored to make sure   
 that the lake is well stocked,and     
 only the larger fish may be removed   
 when caught. Porth resevoir is used   
 for supplying Newquay with water for  
 drinking and washing and for boating. 
   The hedgerows in square 8762 consist
 mostly of grass, ferns, wild shrubs,  
 dandelions and nettles.               </content>
