		<content>  Two problems confront the provision  
of education in Lancaster. The first is
that secondary education in the city is
still based upon selection at age 11+. 
Despite repeated efforts since 1974    
attempts to reorganise have failed. The
governors of Lancaster Royal Grammar   
school wish to keep their status,and   
only an act of Parliament can change   
the character of their school. Conse-  
quently education in Lancaster in 1985 
remains divisive and ill-coordinated.  
Apart from the separate boys and girls 
grammar schools there is a C.of E.aided
school,a catholic school, and three    
secondary moderns.This lack of cohesion
is most unsatisfactory and is a product
of entrenched, vested interests. The   
failure to reorgainise on comprehensive
lines is a recurring problem and no    
answer is right. Only different central
government policy can solve it.        </content>
