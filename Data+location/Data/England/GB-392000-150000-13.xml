		<content> About a hundred single suckler        
 Hereford Cross Friesian cows are      
 bought in and run with the Charollais 
 or Blond d'Aquitaine bulls to calve in
 spring.Most of the calves are sold as 
 stores the following May.The rest are 
 grazed until autumn,then finished     
 indoors and sold fat at eighteen      
 months to two years old.The flock of  
 six hundred Scottish half bred ewes   
 are put to the Suffolk rams in mid    
 October.They are over-wintered on the 
 downs and brought onto lowland leys in
 summer and autumn.It is hoped to      
 in-winter them in 1985/86.The farmer  
 has been told that as more use is to  
 be made by the MOD of Schedule 3 land 
 from 1985 all of it has to be put down
 to grass.
