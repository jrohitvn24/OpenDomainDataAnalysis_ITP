		<title>19PET SURVEY IN WOOTTON</title>
		<content>  We did a pet survey in Norman Way    
 Wootton. We found that the most common
 pets are dogs, with 16 in 32 houses.  
 There were 7 cats, 2 rabbits and a    
 budgie.We found that mainly old age   
 pensioners live in this road and that 
 they bought these animals for         
 companionship.They also have dogs so  
 that they can take them out for walks 
 and so the people get regular         
 exercise.We also found that in houses 
 where there were rabbits there were   
 also children who took a special      
 interest in their animals and looked  
 after them e.g. feeding and cleaning  
 out cages.
