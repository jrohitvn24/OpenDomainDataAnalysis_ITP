		<content> There are 3 churches and chapels in   
 the west of the area all dating from  
 the late 19th century when population 
 increased and non-conformism spread.  
{Church of England}- St. Michael's     
 Church(1877) stands on a hillside with
 a view over Lumb and was a daughter   
 church of Newchurch(3 miles SW). It is
 a large stone building with a tower.  
 The inside has been renovated, the    
 original nave and choir areas no      
 longer in use. The congregation       
 usually numbers 25.{Lumb Baptist,}    
 founded in 1827 was built in 1871 over
 the culverted river. It is a large    
 building and incorporates many smaller
 rooms and a large hall. A lively      
 church,it has large congregations.    
{Eden Methodist}was built in 1874 by   
 migrants from Cornwall as an exact    
 replica of their old chapel. It has   
 little support today.                 </content>
