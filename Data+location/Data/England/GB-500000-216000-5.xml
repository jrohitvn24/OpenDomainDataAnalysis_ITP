		<content> There is neither a doctors surgery nor
 a chemist in the area, which means    
 travelling to Dunstable or Markyate to
 visit or get a prescription made up   
 which is often difficult for the      
 elderly and those without a car.      
 However,the area is covered by        
  District Nurses,Home-helps and Meals 
 on Wheels,the latter organised by the 
 Womens Royal Voluntary Service and    
 manned by voluntary drivers.The meals 
 are cooked at "Steppingstones"        
 Dunstable.There is a travelling Baby  
 Clinic which calls fortnightly in     
 Kensworth in connection with the      
 Mothers and Toddlers Group.There is   
 also a visiting chiropodist.The       
 travelling County Library comes around
 the area fortnightly and in Kensworth 
 library books are taken to housebound 
 people by a volunteer.The nearest     
 hospital is Luton &amp; Dunstable.        </content>
