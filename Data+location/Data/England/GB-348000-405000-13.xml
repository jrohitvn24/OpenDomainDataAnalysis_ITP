		<title>13SKELMERSDALE - HOUSING</title>
		<content> All the housing in the New Town has   
 been built since about 1960 and the   
 majority is Local Authority  owned.   
 There are a number of estates each    
 with their own particular identity and
 style but the feature common to all is
 the centralised motor access and the  
 pedestrianised areas surrounding the  
 housing developments.                 
 Considerable efforts are currently    
 being made to improve and modernise a 
 number of these properties and a      
 number of Sheltered properties for the
 elderly have been built in recent     
 years. Skelmersdale has a mainly young
 population but this is changing       
 gradually as the town matures.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
