		<content>  The colours for{clothes}this year are
 mainly white, pink and blue. Our      
 fashions keep changing. Plastic       
{bangles}and{earrings}are the trend    
 this year. You can buy earrings that  
 are gold or silver, plastic or metal. 
 Some earrings are dangly, others are  
 just stud-like. Lots of earrings are  
 in pastel colours.  Plastic{bags}are  
 the  rage now; lots of people have    
 them. Plastic{shoes}were fashionable  
 last year and they still are.         
{ Hairstyles}are really trendy in 1985.
 You can have{perms}and{skinheads}which
 is where the hair is nearly all shaved
 off. You can colour your hair any     
 colour you want to. You can also make 
 your hair stand on end by back        
 combing. We wear{trainers}on our feet 
 for doing sports or running around. We
 wear{track suits}for jogging or for   
 doing sports on a cold day.           </content>
