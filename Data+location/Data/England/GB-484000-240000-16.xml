		<title>16WILLEN PRIORY MILTON KEYNES</title>
		<content> In Willen Priory's library there is   
 the greatest number of religious books
 in the whole of Milton Keynes. The    
 oldest book there is called Rituale   
 Graecorum and it was published in     
 1647, it was written in Greek and     
 Latin. Willen Priory library is a very
 popular place and a lot of people come
 to borrow the books. Near the library 
 is a building called the workshop     
 where people come to have meetings and
 discussions. Some of the people come  
 to the meetings from as far afield as 
 London and Oxford. In the grounds     
 there are vegetable patches; the      
 Priory grows much of its own food.    
 There are about 3 to 5 acres of       
 grounds. There are 19 people living at
 the Priory but it can house up to 29  
 people. The Priory is near Willen Lake
 and Church. To get to the church you  
 cross a road and follow a small path. </content>
