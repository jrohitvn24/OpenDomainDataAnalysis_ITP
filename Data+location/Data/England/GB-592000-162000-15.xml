		<title>15BAPCHILD CHURCH</title>
		<content>   The church of St Laurence, Bapchild,
 has a flintstone exterior and is      
 typical of churches in the area. It is
 a small church capable of holding 150 
 adults. The stained glass windows have
 recently been renovated, an event that
 occurs every hundred years. The screen
 has been removed from the building    
 which also contains wall paintings    
 that were discovered when decoration  
 was undertaken in recent years. A     
 dinosaur tooth is on display, this    
 being discovered when extensions were 
 made to the sanctuary. The vicar, Rev.
 Woods, is also responsible for two    
 other churches in the area. The       
 churchyard contains many gravestones  
 which reveal that certain families    
 have resided in the village for       
 centuries.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
