		<title>19  Barham Resident Interview</title>
		<content>Our school secretary's father came from
Barham,so she has lived here all her   
life but not in the same house.She told
us that there have been about 7 shops  
in the village at one time,selling     
different things including shoes.After 
the war,ration books were still used   
and once a week a man from the         
International delivered locally.The    
village primary school has seen several
changes since its erection in 1858.    
Mobile classrooms and a hall have      
been added,and new toilets have been   
built.Dinners are no longer cooked at  
the school.Where most of the new       
housing estates are,there used to be   
fields,one of which was used by a      
visiting circus.The R.A.F were         
stationed at the nursing home during   
the Second World War,and a tanks corps 
were based at Broome Park.
